A quarter refers to one-fourth of a year and is typically expressed as Q1 for the first quarter, Q2 for the second quarter, and so forth. For example, a quarter is often shown with its relevant year, as in Q1 2021 or Q121, which represents the first quarter of the year 2021.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A quarter is a three-month period on a company's financial calendar that acts as a basis for periodic financial reports and the paying of dividends.\n* A quarter refers to one-fourth of a year and is typically expressed as Q1 for the first quarter, etc., and can be expressed with the year, such as Q1 2021 (or Q121).\n* Quarterly reports (known as 10-Q filings with the SEC) and earnings are crucial pieces of information for investors and analysts.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:54\n\n#### What's a Quarter?\n\n## Understanding Quarters\n\nMost financial reporting and dividend payments are done quarterly. Not all companies will have fiscal quarters that correspond to calendar quarters and it is common for a company to close their fourth quarter after their busiest time of year. Dividends are also often paid quarterly although many companies outside the U.S. may not pay dividends evenly.\n\nCompanies have two main [accounting periods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingperiod.asp)—the fiscal quarter and the [fiscal year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp) (FY). The fiscal year for most companies runs from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 (although it doesn't have to). The standard calendar quarters that make up the year are as follows:\n\n* January, February, and March (Q1)\n* April, May, and June (Q2)\n* July, August, and September (Q3)\n* October, November, and December (Q4)\n\nSome companies have fiscal years that follow different dates. Costco Wholesale Corporation's fiscal year begins in September and ends in the following August. Thus, its fiscal fourth-quarter includes June, July, and August.1\n\nFiscal quarters for a company will coincide with their fiscal year (FY).\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nCompanies, investors, and analysts use data from different quarters to make comparisons and evaluate trends. For example, it is common for a company’s quarterly report to be compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Many companies are [seasonal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonality.asp) which would make a comparison over sequential quarters misleading.\n\nA retail company could earn half its annual profits in the fourth quarter while a construction company does most of its business in the first three quarters. In this situation, comparing the first quarter results for a department store to their performance during the fourth quarter would indicate an alarming drop in sales.\n\nEvaluating a seasonal company during its slow quarters can be enlightening. It is reasonable to assume that if sales and profits are growing in the off-quarters when compared to the same quarter in prior years, the intrinsic strength of the company is also improving.\n\nFor example, auto dealers typically have a slow first quarter and rarely conduct incentive sales programs in February and March. Thus, if an auto dealer saw significant improvement in sales in the first quarter, this year compared to last, it may indicate the potential for surprisingly strong sales in the second and third quarters as well.\n\n## Types of Quarters\n\n### Quarterly Reports\n\n[Quarterly earnings reports](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsreport.asp) are important for publicly traded companies and their investors. Each release has the potential to affect the value of a company’s stock. If a company has a good quarter, its stock value may increase. If the company has a poor quarter the value of its stock could drop dramatically.\n\nAll public companies in the U.S. must file quarterly reports, known as [Form 10-Q](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10q.asp), with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) at the end of their first three fiscal quarters. Each 10-Q includes unaudited financial statements and operations information for the previous three months (quarter).2\n\nA publicly-traded company must also file an annual report, known as [Form 10-K](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp). The annual report will often include more detailed information than the quarterly reports including an audit statement, presentations, and additional disclosures.2\n\nThe quarterly earnings report often includes forward-looking “[guidance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guidance.asp)” for what management expects from the next few quarters or through the end of the year. These estimates are used by analysts and investors to develop their expectations for performance over the next few quarters.\n\nThe estimates and guidance provided by analysts and management can have a big impact on a stock every three months. If management issues guidance for the next quarter that is worse than expected, the stock’s price will drop. Similarly, if management issues guidance—or an analyst upgrade their independent estimates—the stock can rise significantly.\n\n### Quarterly Dividends\n\nIn the U.S., most companies that pay a [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) will distribute it more or less evenly over four quarters. In many economies outside the U.S., it is common to split the annual dividend into quarterly payments with one of the payments being much larger than the others. It is also not unusual to find companies outside the U.S. that only pay one dividend per year.\n\nThe payment of quarterly dividends can create some volatility in a stock's price when the [ex-date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-date.asp) arrives. Some analysts have noticed that investors may rebalance or sell their stock on the ex-date or soon after when the dividend growth rate appears to be slowing or other changes in the market make the dividend less attractive.\n\n### Non-Standard Quarters\n\nFor a variety of reasons, some public companies will use a non-standard or non-calendar quarterly reporting system. In addition, certain governments use different quarter systems. The first quarter of the U.S. federal government’s fiscal year is October, November, and December. State governments may also have their own fiscal calendars.3\n\nSometimes a company may have a non-standard fiscal year to help with business or tax planning. The [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) allows companies to choose a “tax year” that is still 52-53 weeks long but does not end in December.4\n\nH&R Block ([HRB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=hrb)) ends its fiscal year on April 30th, which makes sense because that is the end of the busiest part of the company’s year.5\n\nReleasing an annual report, which may be accompanied by shareholder meetings and additional disclosures, after the busiest part of your year helps managers and shareholders make better decisions about the year ahead.\n\nCompanies that rely on U.S. government contracts may use September as the end of their fiscal year, and the fourth quarter because that is when they expect new projects to be closed and budget planning from the government to be available. Meanwhile, some companies have very unusual quarterly systems.\n\n## Criticism of Quarters\n\nSome have questioned the importance of the quarterly reporting system. The big argument against the setup is that it puts too much pressure on companies and executives to deliver short-term results to please analysts and investors as opposed to focusing on the long-term interests of the business. \n \n\nThe other issue is that companies report their summary annual statements once per year, so the information can become stale and out of date in between the annual reporting cycle. One approach to solve this problem is to use a trailing four quarters or [trailing 12 months](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) (TTM) analysis.\n\nBy the middle of the fourth quarter of 2021, the annual data for 2021 can be estimated by summarizing the last four quarters. In this case, assume that the company’s third-quarter 2021 results are available. An analyst would manually combine the quarterly data from the first three quarters of 2021 with the last quarter of 2020 to estimate the company’s earnings and revenue trends.\n\nThis analysis will overlap some of the data used in the last annual report, but it will still give some insight into how 2021 is likely to look by the end of the year. If the first three quarters of 2021 had been poor compared to the first three-quarters of 2020, the trailing-four-quarter analysis will show that.\n\nGiven that there are so many variables that have to be accounted for with each new quarter, utilizing the [best accounting software](https://www.investopedia.com/best-accounting-software-5069131) is a great way to help accounts save time and ensure all reporting is accurate.\n\n## What Is a Fiscal Quarter?\n\nA fiscal quarter is a three-month period in which a company reports its financial results. As its name suggests, there are four quarterly periods in a year, meaning a publicly-traded company would issue four quarterly reports per year. Companies and investors alike use fiscal quarters to keep track of their financial results and business developments over time. These quarters are often referred to as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.\n\n## Are Quarters Always Lined Up to the Calendar Year?\n\nQuarters do not always line up with the calendar year. For instance, if a company chooses to have its fiscal year starting in February rather than January, then its first quarter would consist of February, March, and April. Companies sometimes choose to do this if they want their fiscal year to end in their own peak season.  Alternatively, since finishing the year often involves a lot of additional accounting work, some companies choose to end their fiscal year on a relatively calm month.\n\n## What Are the Pros and Cons of Quarterly Reporting?\n\nThe main advantage of quarterly reporting is that it allows investors more information on which to base their investment decisions. Rather than waiting until a company files its annual report, investors can read their quarterly filings to get a sense of how the business is progressing throughout the year. This added transparency also benefits journalists and regulators. Some have argued, however, that quarterly reporting makes companies and investors more oriented toward short-term results.", "timestamp": 1655169712, "digest": "gWp6RW2BFAGSITI2xZ3cguQcZYLdVKlRb9zL54bb8Js", "contributor": "0x7dbEd6baaDb04E14c3BC92FA9eac28c4d3b967cc"}

In a chart, this pattern of activity would follow the shape of a capital \"J\".\n\nThe J-curve effect is often cited in economics to describe, for instance, the way that a country’s [balance of trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp) initially worsens following a devaluation of its currency, then quickly recovers and finally surpasses its previous performance.\n\nJ-curves are observed in other fields including medicine and political science. In each case, it depicts an initial loss followed by a significant gain to a level that exceeds the starting point.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 16 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:16\n\n#### J-Curve Effect\n\n## Understanding the J-Curve\n\nThe J-curve is useful to demonstrate the effects of an event or action over a set period of time. Put bluntly, it shows that things are going to get worse before they get better.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A J-curve depicts a trend that starts with a sharp drop and is followed by a dramatic rise.\n* The trendline ends in an improvement from the starting point.\n* In economics, the J-curve shows how a currency depreciation causes a severe worsening of a trade imbalance followed by a substantial improvement.\n\nIn economics, it is often used to observe the effects of a weaker currency on trade balances. The pattern is as follows:\n\n* Immediately after a nation's currency is devalued, imports get more expensive and exports get cheaper, creating a worsening [trade deficit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade_deficit.asp) (or at least a smaller trade surplus).\n* Shortly thereafter, the sales volume of the nation's exports begins to rise steadily, thanks to their relatively cheap prices.\n* At the same time, consumers at home begin to buy more locally-produced goods because they are relatively affordable compared to imports.\n* Over time, the trade balance between the nation and its partners bounces back and even exceeds pre-devaluation times.\n\nThe devaluation of the nation's currency had an immediate negative effect because of an inevitable lag in satisfying greater demand for the country's products.\n\nWhen a [country’s currency appreciates](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/080613/effects-currency-fluctuations-economy.asp), economists note, a reverse J-curve may occur. The country’s exports abruptly become more expensive for importing countries. If other countries can fill the demand for a lower price, the stronger currency will reduce its export competitiveness. Local consumers may switch to imports, too, because they have become more competitive with locally-produced goods.\n\n### The J-Curve in Private Equity\n\nThe term J-curve is used to describe the typical trajectory of investments made by a private equity firm.\n\nThe J-curve is a visual representation of the plain fact that sometimes things will get worse before they get better.\n\nPrivate equity firms have a different path to profitability than public companies or the funds that invest in them.\n\nTheir portfolios, by design, are made up of companies that were performing poorly when they were purchased. The firm then spends substantial amounts of money retooling the company before spinning it off as a renewed company.\n\nThat means an initial decline in performance followed, at least theoretically, by a steep improvement in performance.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvnUKRIC63zkwKbekffazLA565QCRQXVo0YhAZiEx02iQFNcIK-JfbUIevlWEXYLSmjmliy7rV2x_LOC34AATjkoTNgN8P2cpXqU5-gClOkMNQNsZ7cD4NyeSEATOryLbHuM2fQ5-OT5EkoVgfq6pZ83Faep8peBQ49Vv8P4rZChGRoFREYZ8MuUya5wtJ9KRdtq70nsF5XUbhKg2BhgHXadyoBrbEPVI-e_xbDKNQWS2MxyXU61AyPqcmaiQKMgYmPC7ZUXnTaDUvBmJ8tNZeCGkF_bf-D9OreFZzCe6xhFbvXklLyxKlxibupu8bZWVcPsOlvK4bWKzPkRrL4oQ&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKirDt5LzmUQEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvnUKRIC63zkwKbekffazLA565QCRQXVo0YhAZiEx02iQFNcIK-JfbUIevlWEXYLSmjmliy7rV2x_LOC34AATjkoTNgN8P2cpXqU5-gClOkMNQNsZ7cD4NyeSEATOryLbHuM2fQ5-OT5EkoVgfq6pZ83Faep8peBQ49Vv8P4rZChGRoFREYZ8MuUya5wtJ9KRdtq70nsF5XUbhKg2BhgHXadyoBrbEPVI-e_xbDKNQWS2MxyXU61AyPqcmaiQKMgYmPC7ZUXnTaDUvBmJ8tNZeCGkF_bf-D9OreFZzCe6xhFbvXklLyxKlxibupu8bZWVcPsOlvK4bWKzPkRrL4oQ&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKirDt5LzmUQEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "czyrIbR6WpnqKLpf0H8IfdG4fEozUWYZAhJTbTYggX0", "title": "Japanese Government Bond (JGB)", "body": "## What Is a Japanese Government Bond (JGB)?\n\nA Japanese Government Bond (JGB) is a bond issued by the government of Japan. The government pays interest on the bond until the maturity date. At the maturity date, the full price of the bond is returned to the bondholder. Japanese government bonds play a key role in the financial securities market in Japan.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are bonds issued by the Japanese government and have become a key part of the country's central bank efforts to boost inflation.\n* There are three key types of JGBs—general bonds, Fiscal Investment and Loan Program bonds, and subsidy bonds.\n* JGBs are similar to U.S. Treasuries in that they are backed by the national government and low-risk.\n\n## Understanding Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs)\n\nJapanese government bonds (JGBs) have various maturities ranging from 2 years to 40 years. Fixed coupon payments are determined at the time of issuance and are paid on a semi-annual basis until the security matures.1\n\nThere are four kinds of Japanese government bonds (JGBs):2\n\n1. General bonds, such as [construction bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/construction-bond.asp) and debt financing bonds.\n2. Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP) bonds, which can be used to raise funds for the investment of the Fiscal Loan Fund.\n3. Reconstruction bonds.\n4. Refunding bonds.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nA decline in liquidity in the JGB market has been observed in recent years due to the aggressive monetary actions of the central bank—the [Bank of Japan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankofjapan.asp) (BoJ). In 2013, the Bank of Japan began buying up billions of dollars of Japanese government bonds, flooding the economy with cash in an effort to propel the country’s low annual [inflation rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) toward its 2% target. To keep the yield on ten-year JGBs close to zero, a rise in the yield of these bonds triggers a buy action from the BoJ.3\n\nAs of 2020, the central bank owns over 48% of Japanese government bonds.4 There is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices, which are dictated by supply and demand in the markets. Heavy buying of JGBs increases the demand for the bonds, which leads to an increase in the price of the bonds. The price increase forces down the bond yield, an essential element of the central bank’s ultra-loose [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp) control (YCC) policy, which was designed to help increase the profits that Japanese banks could earn from lending money.\n\nThe Bank of Japan implemented the yield curve control in 2016 in an effort to keep the yield on its ten-year JGB at zero and to [steepen the yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/curve-steepener-trade.asp). The yield curve steepens when the spread between short-term interest rates, which are negative in Japan, and long-term rates increase.3 The wider spread in interest rates creates opportunities to [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp) profits, which is advantageous for banks in Japan.\n\nIn 2021, the Bank of Japan reduced its bond-buying and began announcing purchases on a quarterly, rather than a monthly, schedule. Reportedly this happened because the policy of aggressively targeting 0% yields had led to stagnant trading in the bond market. By reducing intervention in the bond market, the bank hoped to encourage more active trading.5\n\n## Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) vs. U.S. Treasuries\n\nJapanese government bonds (JGBs) are very much like [U.S. Treasury securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp). They are fully backed by the Japanese government, making them a very popular investment among low-risk investors and a useful investment among high-risk investors as a way to balance the risk factor of their portfolios. Like [U.S. savings bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ussavingsbonds.asp), they have high levels of credit and liquidity, which further adds to their popularity. Furthermore, the price and yield at which JGBs trade is used as a [benchmark](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmarkbond.asp) against which other, riskier debt in the country is valued.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

However, quantitative trading is becoming more commonly used by individual investors.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Quantitative trading utilizes mathematical functions and automated trading models to make trading decisions.\n* In this type of trading, backtested data are applied to various scenarios to help identify opportunities for profit.\n* The advantage of quantitative trading is that it allows for optimal use of available data and eliminates the emotional decision-making that can occur during trading.\n* A disadvantage of quantitative trading is that it has limited use: a quantitative trading strategy loses its effectiveness once other market actors learn of it, or as market conditions change.\n* High-frequency trading (HFT) is an example of quantitative trading at scale.\n\n## Understanding Quantitative Trading\n\nQuantitative traders take advantage of modern technology, mathematics, and the availability of comprehensive databases for making rational trading decisions.\n\nQuantitative traders take a trading technique and create a model of it using mathematics, and then they develop a computer program that applies the model to historical market data. The model is then backtested and optimized. If favorable results are achieved, the system is then implemented in real-time markets with real capital.\n\nThe way quantitative trading models function can best be described using an analogy. Consider a weather report in which the meteorologist forecasts a 90% chance of rain while the sun is shining. The meteorologist derives this counterintuitive conclusion by collecting and analyzing climate data from sensors throughout the area.\n\nA computerized quantitative analysis reveals specific patterns in the data. When these patterns are compared to the same patterns revealed in historical climate data (backtesting), and 90 out of 100 times the result is rain, then the meteorologist can draw the conclusion with confidence—hence, the 90% forecast. Quantitative traders apply this same process to the financial market to make trading decisions.\n\nHistorical price, volume, and correlation with other assets are some of the more common data inputs used in quantitative analysis as the main inputs to mathematical models.\n\n## Examples of Quantitative Trading\n\nDepending on the trader's research and preferences, quantitative trading algorithms can be customized to evaluate different parameters related to a stock. Consider the case of a trader who believes in momentum investing. They can choose to write a simple program that picks out the winners during an upward momentum in the markets. During the next market upturn, the program will buy those stocks.\n\nThis is a fairly simple example of quantitative trading. Typically an assortment of parameters, from technical analysis to value stocks to fundamental analysis, is used to pick out a complex mix of stocks designed to maximize profits. These parameters are programmed into a trading system to take advantage of market movements.\n\n### \n\n*Quantitative trading techniques are utilized extensively by certain hedge funds, [high-frequency trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-frequency-trading.asp) (HFT) firms, [algorithmic trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithmictrading.asp) platforms, and [statistical arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statisticalarbitrage.asp) desks. These techniques may involve rapid-fire order execution and typically have short-term investment horizons.*\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Quantitative Trading\n\nThe objective of trading is to calculate the optimal probability of executing a profitable trade. A typical trader can effectively monitor, analyze and make trading decisions on a limited number of securities before the amount of incoming data overwhelms the decision-making process. The use of quantitative trading techniques illuminates this limit by using computers to automate the monitoring, analyzing, and trading decisions.\n\nOvercoming emotion is one of the most pervasive problems with trading. Be it fear or greed, when trading, emotion serves only to stifle rational thinking, which usually leads to losses. Computers and mathematics do not possess emotions, so quantitative trading eliminates this problem.\n\nQuantitative trading does have its problems. Financial markets are some of the most dynamic entities that exist. Therefore, quantitative trading models must be as dynamic to be consistently successful. Many quantitative traders develop models that are temporarily profitable for the market condition for which they were developed, but they ultimately fail when market conditions change.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Do quant traders make a lot of money?\n\nBecause they must possess a certain level of mathematical skill, training, and knowledge, quant traders are often in demand on Wall St. Indeed, many quants have advanced degrees in fields like applied statistics, computer science, or mathematical modeling. As a result, successful quants can earn a great deal of money, especially if they are employed by a successful hedge fund or trading firm.\n\n### What is a quantitative trader?\n\nQuantitative traders, or quants for short, use mathematical models and large data sets to identify trading opportunities and buy and sell securities.\n\n### How do I become a quant?\n\nAn aspiring quant trader needs to be exceptionally skilled and interested in all things mathematical. A bachelor's degree in math, a master's degree in financial engineering or quantitative financial modeling, or an MBA are all helpful for scoring a job; many analysts will also have a Ph.D. in these or similar fields. In addition to an advanced degree, a quant should also have experience and familiarity with data mining, research methods, statistical analysis, and automated trading systems.\n\n### What is the difference between algorithmic and quantitative trading?\n\nThe primary difference is that algorithmic trading is able to automate trading decisions and executions. While a human can be a quant, computers are much faster and more accurate than even the most dexterous trader.\n\n### Where can I learn algorithmic or quantitative trading for free?\n\nBecause quant trading requires a mastery of math, statistics, and programming, it is unlikely to be the case that one can simply read a few books and become adept. Rather, successful quants invest a great deal of time and money in formal education, industry credentialing, and self-study. Additionally, the cost of the trading systems and infrastructure to begin trading as a quant are high and capital-intensive.", "timestamp": 1655169517, "digest": "FrU-iIVe9AvrnjRI0wVmBvy72feZxocpUh2lnzKpZtY", "contributor": "0xeac41B63F98771428d17D43e2ed8b020666c561d"}

{"id": "OcGqdy9uT08vB6YmvolR09bj8NzNDt1Ja6kIp7vGEuQ", "title": "Quantity Demanded", "body": "## What Is Quantity Demanded?\n\nQuantity demanded is a term used in economics to describe the total amount of a good or service that consumers demand over a given interval of time. It depends on the price of a good or service in a marketplace, regardless of whether that market is in [equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp).\n\nThe relationship between the quantity demanded and the price is known as the demand curve, or simply the demand. The degree to which the quantity demanded changes with respect to price is called the [elasticity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elasticity.asp) of demand.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* In economics, quantity demanded refers to the total amount of a good or service that consumers demand over a given period of time.\n* Quantity demanded depends on the price of a good or service in a marketplace.\n* The price of a product and the quantity demand for that product have an inverse relationship, according to the law of demand.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:07\n\n#### Quantity Demanded\n\n## Understanding Quantity Demanded\n\n### Inverse Relationship of Price and Demand\n\nThe price of a good or service in a marketplace determines the quantity that consumers demand. Assuming that non-price factors are removed from the equation, a higher price results in a lower quantity demanded and a lower price results in higher quantity demanded. Thus, the price of a product and the quantity demanded for that product have an inverse relationship, as stated in the [law of demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdemand.asp).\n\nAn inverse relationship means that higher prices result in lower quantity demand and lower prices result in higher quantity demand.\n\n### Change in Quantity Demanded\n\nA change in quantity demanded refers to a change in the specific quantity of a product that buyers are willing and able to buy. This change in quantity demanded is caused by a change in the price.\n\n### Increase in Quantity Demanded\n\nAn increase in quantity demanded is caused by a decrease in the price of the product (and vice versa). A demand curve illustrates the quantity demanded and any price offered on the market. A change in quantity demanded is represented as a movement along a demand curve. The proportion that quantity demanded changes relative to a change in price is known as the elasticity of demand and is related to the slope of the demand curve.\n\nJulie Bang / Investopedia \n\n## An Example of Quantity Demanded\n\nSay, for example, at the price of $5 per hot dog, consumers buy two hot dogs per day; the quantity demanded is two. If vendors decide to increase the price of a hot dog to $6, then consumers only purchase one hot dog per day. On a graph, the quantity demanded moves leftward from two to one when the price rises from $5 to $6. If, however, the price of a hot dog decreases to $4, then customers want to consume three hot dogs: the quantity demanded moves rightward from two to three when the price falls from $5 to $4. \n\nBy graphing these combinations of price and quantity demanded, we can construct a [demand curve](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/intro-supply-demand.asp) connecting the three points.\n\nUsing a standard demand curve, each combination of price and quantity demanded is depicted as a point on the downward sloping line, with the price of hot dogs on the y-axis and the quantity of hot dogs on the x-axis. This means that as price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. Any change or movement to quantity demanded is involved as a movement of the point along the demand curve and not a shift in the demand curve itself. As long as consumers' preferences and other factors don't change, the demand curve effectively remains static.\n\nPrice changes change the quantity demanded; changes in consumer preferences change the demand curve. If, for example, environmentally conscious consumers switch from gas cars to electric cars, the demand curve for traditional cars would inherently shift.\n\n## Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nThe proportion to which the quantity demanded changes with respect to price is called elasticity of demand. A good or service that is highly elastic means the quantity demanded varies widely at different price points.\n\nConversely, a good or service that is inelastic is one with a quantity demanded that remains relatively static at varying price points. An example of an inelastic good is insulin. Regardless of price point, those who need insulin demand it at the same amount.", "timestamp": 1655169606, "digest": "6J8UXxTpQqk3BVadmC2CC_wugdghu5OjwZ_YOzHW0Kk", "contributor": "0xd193c54b8A669E73BbFF120102dE0145747f232f"}
{"id": "rVj4DRd_3x7RtZyOSH5Bp93R2sWAs3cwifPL2MH6sUs", "title": "Jensen's Measure", "body": "## What Is the Jensen's Measure?\n\nThe Jensen's measure, or Jensen's alpha, is a risk-adjusted performance measure that represents the average return on a portfolio or investment, above or below that predicted by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), given the portfolio's or investment's beta and the average market return. This metric is also commonly referred to as simply alpha.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Jensen's measure is the difference in how much a person returns vs. the overall market.\n* Jensen's measure is commonly referred to as alpha. When a manager outperforms the market concurrent to risk, they have \"delivered alpha\" to their clients.\n* The measure accounts for the risk-free rate of return for the time period.\n\n## Understanding Jensen's Measure\n\nTo accurately analyze the performance of an [investment manager](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp), an investor must look not only at the overall return of a portfolio but also at the risk of that portfolio to see if the investment's return compensates for the risk it takes. For example, if two mutual funds both have a 12% return, a rational investor should prefer the less risky fund. Jensen's measure is one of the ways to determine if a portfolio is earning the proper return for its level of risk.\n\nIf the value is positive, then the portfolio is earning excess returns. In other words, a positive value for Jensen's alpha means a [fund manager](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundmanager.asp) has \"beat the market\" with their stock-picking skills.\n\n## Real World Example of Jensen's Measure\n\nAssuming the CAPM is correct, Jensen's alpha is calculated using the following four variables:\n\nUsing these variables, the formula for Jensen's alpha is:\n\nAlpha = R(i) - (R(f) + B x (R(m) - R(f)))\n\n**where:**\n\nR(i) = the realized return of the portfolio or investment\n\nR(m) = the realized return of the appropriate market index\n\nR(f) = the risk-free rate of return for the time period\n\nB = the beta of the portfolio of investment with respect to the chosen market index\n\nFor example, assume a mutual fund realized a return of 15% last year. The appropriate market index for this fund returned 12%. The beta of the fund versus that same index is 1.2, and the risk-free rate is 3%. The fund's alpha is calculated as:\n\nAlpha = 15% - (3% + 1.2 x (12% - 3%)) = 15% - 13.8% = 1.2%.\n\nGiven a beta of 1.2, the mutual fund is expected to be riskier than the index, and thus earn more. A positive alpha in this example shows that the mutual fund manager earned more than enough return to be compensated for the risk they took over the course of the year. If the mutual fund only returned 13%, the calculated alpha would be -0.8%. With a negative alpha, the mutual fund manager would not have earned enough return given the amount of risk they were taking.\n\n## Special Consideration: EMH\n\nCritics of Jensen's measure generally believe in the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), invented by Eugene Fama, and argue that any portfolio manager's excess returns derive from luck or random chance rather than skill. Because the market has already priced in all available information, it is said to be \"efficient\" and accurately priced, the theory says, precluding any active manager from bringing anything new to the table. Further supporting the theory is the fact that many active managers fail to beat the market any more than those that invest their clients' money in passive [index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index-etf.asp).\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvzAjYWMhIPOctPl-nBQ2Oep5HH8uKOzUBGYFbqHbcCdMzC1AK2utVjPaieQDYxg3i6b7L0YA_xG97KHKR2ApNhBC9gzcfkAxapwur-gmgigv5FCPA-MfCIggZUK7JwYO_OpXywr976Ye3D-bgdu0NVxyqG8fP73b1ciScN_2ET-3kkm2x9MgGTlVLx_BytZJb0UQq7abvf8vM9guee57E7HU9GYDz8nKsYLFc0VuK-4OqRPhZ-SRmOk5PDM3buhOIEqbwgI1ljqqyOqC13NH7Cv3h9UGQzvfNVRJHvhihvDpUDfx7wnYwm7D6a3zZSuZ2vi8ZLDmA2y5k1wqCbWZW_7TOL1NPQnBI9l-7EXdYojFQ&sig=Cg0ArKJSzA5cLYhwaiXEEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvzAjYWMhIPOctPl-nBQ2Oep5HH8uKOzUBGYFbqHbcCdMzC1AK2utVjPaieQDYxg3i6b7L0YA_xG97KHKR2ApNhBC9gzcfkAxapwur-gmgigv5FCPA-MfCIggZUK7JwYO_OpXywr976Ye3D-bgdu0NVxyqG8fP73b1ciScN_2ET-3kkm2x9MgGTlVLx_BytZJb0UQq7abvf8vM9guee57E7HU9GYDz8nKsYLFc0VuK-4OqRPhZ-SRmOk5PDM3buhOIEqbwgI1ljqqyOqC13NH7Cv3h9UGQzvfNVRJHvhihvDpUDfx7wnYwm7D6a3zZSuZ2vi8ZLDmA2y5k1wqCbWZW_7TOL1NPQnBI9l-7EXdYojFQ&sig=Cg0ArKJSzA5cLYhwaiXEEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "VI1GE1oHRggGXkSHwHWZm-CH24F4UT1672Q1hdL_aE8", "title": "Quantitative Easing (QE)", "body": "## What Is Quantitative Easing (QE)?\n\nQuantitative easing (QE) is a form of unconventional [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) in which a central bank purchases longer-term [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) from the open market in order to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. Buying these securities adds new money to the economy, and also serves to lower interest rates by bidding up fixed-income securities. It also expands the central bank's balance sheet.\n\nWhen short-term interest rates are either at or approaching zero, the normal [open market operations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openmarketoperations.asp) of a central bank, which target interest rates, are no longer effective. Instead, a central bank can target specified amounts of assets to purchase. Quantitative easing increases the [money supply](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp) by purchasing assets with newly-created bank reserves in order to provide banks with more [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Quantitative easing (QE) is a form of monetary policy used by central banks as a method of quickly increasing the domestic money supply and spurring economic activity.\n* Quantitative easing usually involves a country's central bank purchasing longer-term government bonds, as well as other types of assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\n* In response to the economic shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 15, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a quantitative easing plan of over $700 billion.1\n* Then, on June 10, 2020, after a brief tapering effort, the Fed extended its program, committing to buy at least $80 billion a month in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities, until further notice.21\n\n#### Click Play to Learn How Quantitative Easing Works\n\n## Understanding Quantitative Easing (QE)\n\nTo execute quantitative easing, [central banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) increase the supply of money by buying [government bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp) and other securities. Increasing the supply of money lowers [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp). When interest rates are lower, banks can lend with easier terms. Quantitive easing is typically implemented when interest rates are already near zero, because, at this point, central banks have fewer tools to influence economic growth.\n\nIf quantitative easing itself loses effectiveness, a government's [fiscal policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp) may also be used to further expand the money supply. As a method, quantitative easing can be a combination of both monetary and fiscal policy; for example, if a government purchases assets that consist of long-term government bonds that are being issued in order to finance counter-cyclical deficit spending.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nIf central banks increase the money supply, it can create [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp). The worst possible scenario for a central bank is that its quantitative easing strategy may cause inflation without the intended economic growth. An economic situation where there is inflation, but no economic growth, is called [stagflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp).\n\nAlthough most central banks are created by their countries' governments and have some regulatory oversight, they cannot force banks in their country to increase their lending activities. Similarly, central banks cannot force borrowers to seek loans and invest. If the increased money supply created by quantitive easing does not work its way through the banks and into the economy, quantitative easing may not be effective (except as a tool to facilitate deficit spending).\n\nAnother potentially negative consequence of quantitative easing is that it can [devalue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/devaluation.asp) the domestic currency. While a devalued currency can help domestic manufacturers because exported goods are cheaper in the global market (and this may help stimulate growth), a falling currency value makes imports more expensive. This can increase the cost of production and consumer price levels.\n\nFrom 2009 until 2014, the [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp) ran a quantitative easing program by increasing the money supply.3 This had the effect of increasing the asset side of the [Federal Reserve's balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fed-balance-sheet.asp), as it purchased bonds, mortgages, and other assets. The Federal Reserve's liabilities, primarily at U.S. banks, grew by the same amount and stood at over $4 trillion by 2017.4 The goal of this program was for banks to lend and invest those reserves in order to stimulate overall economic growth.\n\nHowever, what actually happened was that banks held onto much of that money as excess reserves. At its pre-coronavirus peak, U.S. banks held $2.7 trillion in excess reserves, which was an unexpected outcome of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program.5\n\nMost economists believe that the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program helped to rescue the U.S. (and potentially the world) economy following the 2008 financial crisis. However, the magnitude of its role in the subsequent recovery is actually impossible to quantify. Other central banks have attempted to deploy quantitative easing as a means of [fighting off recession](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102015/do-interest-rates-increase-during-recession.asp) and [deflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp) in their countries with similarly inconclusive results.\n\n## Examples of Quantitive Easing\n\nFollowing the [Asian Financial Crisis of 1997](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asian-financial-crisis.asp), Japan fell into an economic [recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp).6 Beginning in 2001, the [Bank of Japan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankofjapan.asp) (BoJ)—Japan's central bank—began an aggressive quantitative easing program in order to curb deflation and stimulate the economy. The Bank of Japan moved from buying Japanese government bonds to buying private debt and stocks.7 However, the quantitive easing campaign failed to meet its goals. Between 1995 and 2007, the Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) fell from roughly $5.45 trillion to $4.52 trillion in nominal terms, despite the Bank of Japan's efforts.8\n\nThe [Swiss National Bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swiss-national-bank.asp) (SNB) also employed a quantitative easing strategy following the 2008 financial crisis. Eventually, the SNB owned assets that exceeded the annual economic output for the entire country. This made the SNB's version of quantitive easing the largest in the world (as a ratio to a country's GDP). Although economic growth has been positive in Switzerland, it is unclear how much of the subsequent recovery can be attributed to the SNB's quantitative easing program.910 For example, although interest rates were pushed below 0%, the SNB was still unable to achieve its inflation targets.1112\n\nIn August 2016, the [Bank of England](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boe.asp) (BoE) announced that it would launch an additional quantitative easing program to help address any potential economic ramifications of [Brexit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brexit.asp). The plan was for the BoE to buy 60 billion pounds of government bonds and 10 billion pounds in corporate debt. The plan was intended to keep interest rates from rising in the U.K. and also to stimulate business investment and employment.13\n\nFrom August 2016 through June 2018, the Office for National Statistics in the U.K. reported that gross fixed [capital formation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-formation.asp) (a measure of business investment) was growing at an average quarterly rate of 0.4 percent. This was lower than the average rate from 2009 through 2018.14\n\nAs a result, economists have been tasked with trying to determine whether or not growth would have been worse without this quantitative easing program.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its plan to implement up to $700 billion in asset purchases as an emergency measure to provide liquidity to the U.S. financial system. This decision was made as a result of the massive economic and market turmoil brought on by the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ensuing economic shutdown. Subsequent actions have indefinitely expanded this QE action.15\n\n## How Does Quantitative Easing Work?\n\nQuantitative easing is a type of monetary policy in which a nation’s central bank tries to increase the liquidity in its financial system, typically by purchasing long-dated government bonds from that nation’s largest banks. Quantitative easing was used in 2001 by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) but has since been adopted by the United States and several other countries.16 By purchasing these securities from banks, the central bank hopes to stimulate economic growth by empowering the banks to lend or invest more freely.\n\n## Is Quantitative Easing Printing Money?\n\nCritics have argued that quantitative easing is effectively a form of money printing. These critics often point to examples in history where money printing has led to hyperinflation, such as in the case of Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, or Germany in the 1920s. However, proponents of quantitative easing will point out that, because it uses banks as intermediaries rather than placing cash directly in the hands of individuals and businesses, quantitative easing carries less risk of producing runaway inflation.\n\n## Does Quantitative Easing Cause Inflation?\n\n \n There is disagreement about whether quantitative easing causes inflation, and to what extent it might do so. For example, the BoJ has repeatedly engaged in quantitative easing as a way of deliberately increasing inflation within their economy. However, these attempts have so far failed, with inflation remaining at extremely low levels since the late 1990s.17\n\nSimilarly, many critics warned that the United States’ use of quantitative easing in the years following the [2008 Financial Crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp) would risk unleashing dangerous inflation. But so far, this rise in inflation has yet to materialize.", "timestamp": 1655169428, "digest": "xkdx7H4JWc_eBscAiJjP8yqS0i_wRwQtX49Y25Mkz5c", "contributor": "0xA1Cfd6747f274900d8435c4cD4A0827E5e44f2Ca"}

{"id": "YF3zDaNa3cqu9IyrlB0rsndONaQzlNA9W9M4nZ7hemc", "title": "January Effect", "body": "## What Is the January Effect?\n\nThe January Effect is a perceived seasonal increase in stock prices during the month of January. Analysts generally attribute this [rally](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rally.asp) to an increase in buying, which follows the drop in price that typically happens in December when investors, engaging in tax-loss harvesting to offset realized [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp), prompt a sell-off.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that investors use year-end cash bonuses to purchase investments the following month. While this market anomaly has been identified in the past, the January effect seems to have [largely disappeared](https://www.investopedia.com/the-january-no-effect-4780154) as its presence became known.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The January Effect is the perceived seasonal tendency for stocks to rise in that month.\n* Since 1938, 29 out of 30 years of gains seen in January-February resulted in average yearly S&P 500 advances of 20%.1\n* The January Effect is theorized to occur when investors sell winners to incur year-end capital gains taxes in December and use those funds to speculate on weaker performers.\n* Like other market anomalies and calendar effects, the January Effect is considered by some to be evidence against the efficient markets hypothesis.\n\n## Understanding the January Effect\n\nThe January Effect is a hypothesis, and like all calendar-related effects, suggests that the markets as a whole are inefficient, as [efficient markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp) would naturally make this effect non-existent. The January Effect seems to affect [small caps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp) more than mid or large caps because they are less liquid.\n\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, the data suggests that these asset classes have outperformed the overall market in January, especially toward the middle of the month. Investment banker Sidney Wachtel first noticed this effect in 1942.2 This historical trend, however, has been less pronounced in recent years because the markets seem to have adjusted for it.\n\nAnother reason analysts consider the January Effect less important as of 2021 is that more people are using tax-sheltered retirement plans and therefore have no reason to sell at the end of the year for a tax loss.\n\n## January Effect Explanations\n\nBeyond tax-loss harvesting and repurchases, as well as investors putting cash bonuses into the market, another explanation for the January Effect has to do with investor psychology. Some investors believe that January is the best month to begin an investment program or perhaps are following through on a New Year's resolution to begin investing for the future.\n\nOthers have pontificated that mutual fund managers purchase stocks of top performers at the end of the year and eliminate questionable losers for appearance sake in their year-end reports, an activity known as \"[window dressing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/windowdressing.asp).\" This is unlikely, however, as the buying and selling would primarily affect large caps.\n\nYear-end sell-offs also attract buyers interested in the lower prices, knowing the dips are not based on company [fundamentals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp). On a large scale, this can drive prices higher in January.\n\n## Studies and Criticism\n\nAn ex-Director from the Vanguard Group, Burton Malkiel, the author of *A Random Walk Down Wall Street,* has criticized the January Effect, stating that seasonal anomalies such as it don't provide investors with any reliable opportunities. He also suggests that the January Effect is so small that the transaction costs needed to exploit it essentially make it unprofitable. It's also been suggested that too many people now time for the January Effect so that it becomes priced into the market, nullifying it all together.3\n\nOther researchers have found that January Effect still exists, but only for smaller-cap stocks, owing to a lack of liquidity and interest from investors.4\n\n## What Is the January Effect in the Stock Market?\n\nThe January Effect is a purported market anomaly whereby stock prices tend to regularly rise in the first month of the year. Actual evidence of the January Effect is small, with many scholars arguing that it does not really exist.\n\n## Can You Make Money Exploiting the January Effect?\n\nUnlikely. Even if the January Effect were real (it's probably not) and markets were to rise uncharacteristically each January, the fact that people may try to exploit can undermine its fruition.\n\n## What Is the January Barometer?\n\nThe [January Barometer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/januarybarometer.asp) is a folk theory of the stock market that claims the returns experienced in January will predict the overall performance of the stock market for that year. Thus, a strong January would predict a strong bull market, and a down January a bear market. Actual evidence for this effect is scant.\n\n \n \n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

The job market is not a physical place as much as a concept demonstrating the competition and interplay between different labor forces. It is also known as the [labor market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-market.asp).\n\nThe job market can grow or shrink depending on the demand for labor and the available supply of workers within the overall economy. Other factors which impact the market are the needs of a specific industry, the need for a particular education level or skill set, and required job functions. The job market is a significant component of any economy and is directly tied in with the demand for goods and services.\n\nThe employment numbers are released on the first Friday of every month.1﻿\n\n## The Job Market and the Unemployment Rate\n\nThe job market is also directly related to the [unemployment rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemploymentrate.asp). The unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the labor force who are not currently employed but actively seeking a job. The higher the unemployment rate, the greater the supply of labor in the overall job market.\n\nWhen employers have a larger pool of applicants to choose from, they can be pickier or force down wages. Conversely, as the unemployment rate drops, employers are forced to compete more heavily for available workers. The competition for workers has the effect of increasing wages. Wages determined by the job market provide valuable information for economic analysts and those who set public policy based on the state of the overall economy.\n\n### 24.9%\n\n*The highest rate of unemployment in the U.S, which was documented in 1933.2*﻿\n\nDuring difficult economic times, unemployment tends to rise as employers may reduce their staffing numbers and create fewer new jobs, making it harder for people trying to find work. High rates of unemployment can prolong economic [stagnation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagnation.asp)—a sustained period of little-to-no growth in an economy—and contribute to social upheaval, leading to the loss of opportunities for many individuals to live comfortably.\n\nA report called the Current Population Survey can measure the state of the job market. It's a statistical survey performed every month by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The study includes a representative sample of about 60,000 homes to try and determine the unemployment rate of specific regions, earnings of those surveyed, hours the respondents worked, and many other demographic factors.3﻿\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Employers search for employees and employees search for jobs in the job market.\n* The job market grows or shrinks based on demand for labor and the number of workers in the economy.\n* The job market is directly related to the unemployment rate—a measure of the percentage of people who aren't employed but actively seeking work.\n\n## Example of a Job Market\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics total employment for non-farm payrolls rose by 304,000 for January 2019, and the unemployment rate (a lagging indicator) bumped up to 4.0%.

{"id": "0TQM_x_tWhF2O1Inpk5kABNEF3Y-9t_ZFKSwAqHzhHU", "title": "Who Was John Maynard Keynes?", "body": "### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* British economist John Maynard Keynes is the founder of Keynesian economics.\n* Keynesian economics argues that demand drives supply and that healthy economies spend or invest more than they save.\n* To create jobs and boost consumer buying power during a recession, Keynes held that governments should increase spending, even if it means going into debt.\n* Critics attack Keynesian economics for promoting deficit spending, stifling private investment, and causing inflation.\n\n## Education and Early Career\n\nKeynes’ early interest in economics was due in large part to his father, John Neville Keynes, an Economics lecturer at Cambridge University. His mother, one of Cambridge's first female graduates, was active in charitable works for the underprivileged.\n\nBorn into a middle-class family, he received scholarships to two of the most elite schools in England, Eton College and Cambridge University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1904. Of note, throughout his academic career, he excelled at mathematics—and he had almost no formal training in economics.\n\nEarly in his career, Keynes worked on [probability theory ](https://www.britannica.com/science/probability-theory)and lectured in Economics as Fellow of King's College at Cambridge University. Government roles ranged from official positions in the British Civil Service and the British Treasury to appointments to royal commissions on currency and finance, including his 1919 appointment as the Treasury’s financial representative at the Versailles peace conference that ended World War I.1\n\n## Advocacy of Government Intervention in the Economy\n\nKeynes' father was an advocate of [laissez-faire economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp#:\\~:text=Key%20Takeaways,governments%20are%20involved%20in%20business.), an economic philosophy of [free-market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp) capitalism that opposes government intervention. Keynes himself was a conventional believer in the principles of the free market (and an active investor in the stock market) during his time at Cambridge.\n\nHowever, after the [1929 stock market crash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1929.asp) triggered the [Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp), Keynes came to believe that unrestricted free-market capitalism was essentially flawed and needed to be reformulated, not only to function better in its own right but also to outperform competitive systems like communism.2\n\nAs a result, he began advocating for government intervention to curb unemployment and correct economic recession. In addition to government jobs programs, he argued that increased government spending was necessary to decrease unemployment—even if it meant a [budget deficit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget-deficit.asp). \n \n\n## What Is Keynesian Economics?\n\nThe theories of John Maynard Keynes, known as [Keynesian economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp), center around the idea that governments should play an active role in their countries' economies, instead of just letting the free market reign. Specifically, Keynes advocated federal spending to mitigate downturns in business cycles.\n\nThe most basic principle of Keynesian economics is that demand—not supply—is the driving force of an economy. At the time, conventional economic wisdom held the opposite view: that supply creates demand. Because [aggregate demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp)—the total spending for and consumption of goods and services by the private sector and the government—drives supply, total spending determines all economic outcomes, from the production of goods to the employment rate.\n\nAnother basic principle of Keynesian economics is that the best way to pull an economy out of a recession is for the government to increase demand by infusing the economy with capital. In short, consumption (spending) is the key to economic recovery.\n\nThese two principles are the basis of Keynes' belief that demand is so important that, even if a government has to go into debt to spend, it should do so. According to Keynes, the government boosting the economy in this way will stimulate consumer demand, which in turn spurs production and ensures full employment. \n \n\n## Criticism of Keynesian Economics\n\nAlthough widely adopted after World War II, Keynesian economics has attracted plenty of criticism since the ideas were first introduced in the 1930s.\n\nOne major criticism deals with the concept of big government—the expansion of federal initiatives that must occur to enable the government to participate actively in the economy. Rival economic theorists, like those of the [Chicago School of Economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chicago_school.asp), argue that: economic recessions and booms are part of the natural order of business cycles; direct government intervention only worsens the recovery process, and federal spending discourages private investment.\n\nThe most famous critic of Keynesian economics was [Milton Friedman](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/milton-friedman.asp), an American economist best known for his advocacy of free-market capitalism. Considered the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century—as Keynes was the most influential economist of the first half—Friedman advocated [monetarism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarism.asp), which refuted important parts of Keynesian economics. \n \n\nIn contrast to Keynes’ position that [fiscal policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp)—government spending and tax policies to influence economic conditions—is more important than [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp)—control of the overall supply of money available to banks, consumers, and businesses—Friedman and fellow monetarists held that governments could foster economic stability by targeting the growth rate of the money supply. In short, Friedman and monetarist economists [advocate the control of money in the economy](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012615/what-difference-between-keynesian-economics-and-monetarist-economics.asp), while Keynesian economists advocate government expenditure.\n\nFor example, while Keynes believed that an interventionist government could moderate recessions by using fiscal policy to prop up aggregate demand, spur consumption, and reduce unemployment, Friedman criticized [deficit spending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit-spending.asp) and argued for a return to the free market, including smaller government and deregulation in most areas of the economy—supplemented by a steady increase of the money supply.3\n\n \n \n\n### Keynesian vs. Laissez-Faire Economics\n\n*With its advocacy of government intervention in the economy, Keynesian economics is in sharp contrast to [laissez-faire economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp), which argues that the less the government is involved in economic affairs, the better for business and society as a whole.*\n\n## Examples of Keynesian Economics\n\n### The New Deal\n\nThe onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s significantly influenced Keynes’ economic theories and led to the widespread adoption of several of his policies.\n\nTo address the crisis in the U.S., President Franklin Roosevelt enacted the [New Deal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/new-deal.asp), a series of government programs that directly reflected the Keynesian principle that even a free-enterprise capitalist system requires some federal oversight.\n\nWith the New Deal, the U.S. government intervened to stimulate the national economy on an unprecedented scale, including creating several new agencies focused on providing jobs to unemployed Americans and stabilizing the price of consumer goods. Roosevelt also adopted Keynes' policy of expanded deficit spending to stimulate demand, including programs for public housing, slum clearance, railroad construction, and other massive public works.\n\n###  Great Recession Spending\n\nIn response to the [Great Recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp) of 2007–2009, President Barack Obama took several steps that reflected Keynesian economic theory. The federal government bailed out debt-ridden companies in several industries. It also took into conservatorship [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-credit-crisis.asp#role-in-the-financial-crisis-of-2008), the two major market makers and guarantors of mortgages and home loans.\n\nIn 2009, President Obama signed the [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/american-recovery-and-reinvestment-act.asp), an $831-billion government stimulus package designed to save existing jobs and create new ones. It included tax cuts/credits and unemployment benefits for families; it also earmarked expenditures for healthcare, infrastructure, and education.\n\n###  COVID-19 Stimulus Checks\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump and President Joseph Biden offered a variety of [relief, loan-forgiveness, and loan-extension programs](https://www.investopedia.com/government-stimulus-efforts-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis-4799723).\n\nThe U.S. government also supplemented weekly state unemployment benefits and sent American taxpayers direct aid in the form of three separate, tax-free stimulus checks.\n\n## Legacy\n\nSince the 1930s, the popularity of Keynesian economics has risen and fallen, and the theories have undergone considerable revision since Keynes' day. However, the economic school of thought he founded has left one indelible stamp on modern nations: the idea that governments have a role to play in business—even in capitalist economies. \n \n\n## Who Said Keynesian Economics Was Spending Your Way out of a Recession?\n\nIt was Milton Friedman who attacked the central Keynesian idea that consumption is the key to economic recovery as trying to \"spend your way out of a recession.\"4 Unlike Keynes, Friedman believed that government spending and racking up debt eventually leads to inflation—a rise in prices that lessens the value of money and wages—which can be disastrous unless accompanied by underlying economic growth. The [stagflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp) of the 1970s was a case in point: It was paradoxically a period with high unemployment and low production, but also high inflation and high-interest rates.\n\n## Was Keynes a Socialist?\n\nIt is difficult to pigeonhole Keynes as a socialist.\n\nOn the one hand, he showed an interest in socialist regimes and advocated the presence of government in economic affairs. He emphatically did not believe in letting business cycles go through boom and bust without intervention—or in letting private enterprise operate unfettered.\n\nOn the other hand, Keynes stopped short of advocating that governments actually take over and run industries. He wanted central authorities to stimulate, but not necessarily control, methods of production.\n\nThere is also evidence that he was returning to more traditional free-market capitalism towards the end of his life, as he was considering ways to get post-war Britain out of an economic hole. Shortly before his death in 1946, he told his friend, Secretary of State Henry Clay, that he found himself relying more on a solution he had “tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago\": [Adam Smith’s](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-economics/) [invisible hand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp) (the natural tendency of a free-market economy to self-correct via the [laws of supply and demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp)).56\n\n \n \n\n## What Did Keynes Mean by “In the Long Run, We Are All Dead”?\n\nWhen critics argued that Keynesian support of public financing and deficit spending would lead to default in the long run, Keynes' famous retort was that “In the long run, we are all dead.” In context, his point was that governments should solve problems in the short run rather than wait for market forces to correct problems over the long run—“when we are all dead.”7\n\n## Did Keynes Predict the Rise of Nazi Germany?\n\nDuring the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference, Keynes was an outspoken critic of the crippling economic measures certain senior statesmen wanted to impose on Germany. When his warnings that these harsh sanctions would likely result in economic and political catastrophe for Europe went unheeded, he left the conference early in protest.\n\nAs soon as he returned to the U.K., he resigned from the British Treasury and summarized his arguments about the dangers of a peace treaty designed to permanently crush Germany in *The Economic Consequences of the Peace*.\n\nWithin a year of its publication in 1920, Keynes’ book had become a bestseller that strongly influenced public opinion that the Treaty of Versailles was unfair. As the political and economic turmoil of the 1930s fueled the rise of fascism that exploded into World War II, Keynes’ early warnings began to sound prophetic as well.8\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes and Keynesian economics were revolutionary in the 1930s and did much to shape post-World War II economies in the mid-20th century. His theories came under attack in the 1970s, saw a resurgence in the 2000s, and are still debated today.\n\nA core principle of Keynesian economics is that the best way to pull an economy out of a recession is for the government to increase demand by infusing the economy with capital. In short, consumption (spending) is the key to economic recovery. \n \n\nJust as Keynes was considered the most influential economist of the first half of the 20th century, his most famous critic, Milton Friedman, an advocate of monetarism, was considered the most influential economist of the second half.\n\nKeynes left one significant legacy: the concept that governments have a role to play in the economic well-being of industries and people. The questions that remain are how big the government's role should be and how best to execute that role.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvJiDOX9wNe3j34XUaSy5FVQONEy-7ivZdUFtlcMWuoriLy3WblIdqEH-T8pvxjNXhaIDsPEYxSLH0e4qhXSDgyAIH4voYKK4w7PgLXaGrTpia0K1IvlVNFibiuuUDxP4X4P93b1nZizopVHwLlNbQKWRNKYn3WWECsj68LPZTXswByZX__JHxer086MYSP6bWGx8DBHqplhCXqEGA-_NGRgBtFlVWxYcZxFAjm8-8BdpF1-1y1QwVoj_nTqmQQT-6_sySXvUbNDSjry1mGB6eSc2Z5Wb3pQDNuo3mjys82ytIOSuytO7nd7mKmOMZTn8zZ_bVl2cluP1Qp&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMvgNfopLXOREAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvJiDOX9wNe3j34XUaSy5FVQONEy-7ivZdUFtlcMWuoriLy3WblIdqEH-T8pvxjNXhaIDsPEYxSLH0e4qhXSDgyAIH4voYKK4w7PgLXaGrTpia0K1IvlVNFibiuuUDxP4X4P93b1nZizopVHwLlNbQKWRNKYn3WWECsj68LPZTXswByZX__JHxer086MYSP6bWGx8DBHqplhCXqEGA-_NGRgBtFlVWxYcZxFAjm8-8BdpF1-1y1QwVoj_nTqmQQT-6_sySXvUbNDSjry1mGB6eSc2Z5Wb3pQDNuo3mjys82ytIOSuytO7nd7mKmOMZTn8zZ_bVl2cluP1Qp&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMvgNfopLXOREAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "1e-IY9h2DgVgHBP0LbJyZqsB5LNinw2Y9ElJKTo4fwc", "title": "Joint and Several Liability", "body": "### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* In law, joint and several liability makes all parties in a suit responsible for damages up to the entire amount awarded.\n* That is, if one party is unable to pay, the others named must pay more than their share.\n* More commonly, comparative fault laws limit an individual's payment to a proportion based on the extent of their fault.\n\nIn such cases, responsibility for the total amount awarded would be shared by all. Failure by any of the parties to pay would increase the obligation of the others.\n\n## Understanding Joint and Several Liability\n\nJoint and several [liability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp) favors the plaintiff suing for damages because it empowers them to pursue full payment, if necessary, from the party with the deepest pockets if the others named cannot pay.\n\nIf all of the parties involved are insolvent and uninsured, the plaintiff collects nothing.\n\nJoint and several liability differs in law from comparative fault, in which multiple parties are assigned responsibility for a portion of the damages in relation to the degree of fault that they bear for the harm. In such cases, a plaintiff may be left in the position of seeking damages from the party that is least able to pay.\n\nComparative fault is sometimes called \"pure several liability.\" It is more common in the U.S. than joint and several liability.\n\nMost states in the U.S. have limited the use of joint and several liability, or have developed a hybrid approach. For example, a state might allow joint and several liability to apply only to parties who are found responsible for more than 50% of the damage done.\n\nThe hybrid approach was adopted as a means of reforming a system that appeared to encourage some plaintiffs to add a single party with deep pockets, such as a large corporation, to a suit in order to get an outsized award.\n\n### Criticism of Joint and Several Liability\n\nAs noted, joint and several liability tends to benefit the plaintiff, as it increases the chances that all of the damages awarded can be collected.\n\nMost states in the U.S. limit the use of joint and several responsibility or employ a hybrid approach.\n\nOn the other hand, it may be considered unfair to a party who bears only a minor responsibility for an adverse event to bear an outsized financial loss because of it.\n\n## Example of a Joint and Several Liability Suit\n\nA joint and several liability case could be launched on behalf of workers who became ill after working at multiple job sites where they were exposed to harmful materials.

{"id": "84XeT1-Z4SUlGZRToYQ5tVy43NEPhkRKTLttMBbhGZg", "title": "Phlote Business Day", "body": "6/11/22\n\nWe DESERVE Open Source Music\n\nCopyright law has constrained the music industry for too long. Worrying about rights management and their oversight has the potential to derail music on the internet going froward. Let’s give it up and figure out a new model. \n\nIn fact, we have great examples of how an industry that was once a form of entertainment is now becoming a form of expression. Look at gaming. \n\nMusic is begging to be open source. Hip hop music has been built on sampling and unleashed an uprecentedented era of creativity, albeit with many legal hurdles , and much litigation.  As we enter the phase of the internet where creators are at the center, why not encourage creativity instead of stifle it.\n\nTo do that, we’ll have to get past the idea that music is untouchable. \n\nMore generally, we’ll should also move past the notion that every creative idea needs to be 100% original. In fact, that’s impossible. Every idea is linked to multiple references and many influences. Ideas are composable.\n\nThe music industry may never understand this or relinquish control over protections  that power their business, expecailly after the catalog buying spree we’ve seen recently.  Could this be where Web3 steps up?  If we’re building new infrastructure to encourage massive global collaboration, why should music be left out. \n\nFUCK COPYRIGHTS\n\nOpen Source Music admits that all music exists along a cointuum of ideass that are connected and welcomes more participants to the party. Blockchain technology allows a rich web of content to be captured around the original work to create a rich experience to measure the true cultural value of a work. All comments, fan art, reaction videos, and social media can be linked to show the true culturual value of a song. The crowd matters. A public history   A user generated ecosystem that forms a new culture of openness and sharing. \n\nEvery idea is borrowed. Every published work is a rough draft. Lets increase the pace of innovation, use music to showcae whats possible using this technology. Music makes us feel something.  Why not let everyone express that.\n\nThis token will be used to build a user generated ecosystem for music that forges a new culture of opennes and sharing. We’ll also support any platofrm that supports this and ask any partners that are building towards the same future to join us\n\n\\#001 Genesis Tokens for our founding partners. \n\n1000 Tokens available  x 1 ETH\n\n[https://zora.co/collections/zora/4341](https://zora.co/collections/zora/4341)\n\n5/12/22\n\n1.

Distributed Bandcamp w/ bespoke artists marketplaces\n\n5/11/22\n\nGuests: Michael Norman, Dee Goens\n\n5/2/22\n\nEverything is moving towards Open Source.\n\nOpen Source Work, Open Source Music, everything will be open to be reused, remixed…I believe. DAOs are open source projects with a token.  The largest companies being built in Web3 rn will have characteristics that are gleaned from decades of open source development.\n\nWe’ve been headed this direction, but now have a framework to follow. The open source movement has been around for 40 years. Lots of examples on how to build product with community.\n\n[https://future.a16z.com/open-source-community-commercialization/](https://future.a16z.com/open-source-community-commercialization/)\n\nOther insights:  Interest circle are about to dominate social circles. Social media for interests.\n\n4/29/22\n\nPhlote is a community-owned and operated music discovery platform. The value of Phlote is the sum total of our community contributions. Our ability to curate talented artists into Web3 is reflected in the value of our unique social token, $PV1, which gives every member of Team Phlote an economic stake in its growth.\n\nTo facilitate the growth of our community, we've built a music TCR as a merit based community onboarding tool. created an open submission process that allows any music fan with an internet connection and a crypto wallet to earn $PV1 tokens for curating music on Phlote.xyz.\n\nWe're opening the door for people with a keen eye for talent to distinguish themselves as leading curatorial voices in Web3.\n\nHow do people get these tokens?\n\nEach day, our community members scan the music submissions on Phlote.xyz and co-sign the songs they like. Curators who receive co-signs, earn $PV1 tokens and earn the right to have a profile on Phlote.xyz to start building their track record.\n\nThis effort ensures Team Phlote controls how the community grows and helps guarantee that our path towards a truly community-owned platform - where curators are the owners and operators of the network - is in line with the open, transparent, and permission-less ethos of blockchain technology.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. $PV1 isn’t available for purchase and can only be earned through submission at Phlote.xyz.\n2. $PV1 will be distributed to anyone who submits music at Phlote.xyz and receives co-signs from current members of the community.\n3. Curators earn 15 $PV1 for each co-sign received.\n4. Curators earn higher status within the community as they earn more $PV1 tokens. 1 co-sign earns the right to have a unique profile on Phlote. Curators who earn 20 co-signs (300 $PV1) earn the right to become co-signers.\n5. The game will last until the total supply of 1,000,000 $PV1 tokens has been fully distributed to members of the community.\n\nThe Goal?\n\n1. To surface up-and-coming voices at the cross section of music and technology.\n2. To introduce the world's most talented, independent artists to the blockchain.\n3. To build Team Phlote into an elite community of artists and curators who will create the world's leading music discovery platform.\n\n4/27/22\n\nOur #1 Priority: A custom auction house that sells NFT editions at Vickrey Auction. All NFT editions are sold in rounds with preference given to DAO contributors. Phlote to test auction mechanics with NFT sale that decentralizes marketplace on Day 1.\n\n4/25/22\n\nThe full potential for Web3 are products that are 100% built, operated, and owned by the community around them. Platforms that are open for anyone to join, have a clear mission, and a value orientation. These platforms will be structured as user owned companies or DAOs.\n\nIn the music industry, many artists must fight to be heard. Music discovery is not designed to showcase the many talented vocalists, musicians, producers, songwriters who exist in the world, but should.\n\nWe propose a system that centers artists, curators, and collectors as the backbone of the music industry. One that incentivizes the discovery of new music, makes it easily sharable, and help artists to identify their core fans. This alternative path that allows great music to be heard and doesn’t require artists to sign away their creative rights or ownership to labels.\n\nThe opportunity allows a new set of internet users to participate. Now anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can earn tokens for phloting great music to Web3.\n\n4/20/22\n\nSome believe that music discovery is alive and well in the hands of streaming platforms like Spotify.  We disagree.\n\n1. Today music discovery is not happening for independent artists on streaming platforms. Sixty thousand songs are uploaded daily. Only major label supported artists get seen. The system is broken.\n2. Algorithms are an inferior way to spur word of mouth spread for indie artists. Human recommendations reign supreme in music discovery.\n3. The True Fans looking to find new music are coming to Web3 for the ability to discover new artists and buy in early via NFTs. Adding crypto may prove difficult for incumbent music platforms to implement.\n4. Users will begin to migrate to platforms that they help build, use, and co-own as a community. Spotify is not likely to revolutionize a business model that has been profitable for the executive team and shareholders.\n\nPhlote is designed to solve these issues for artists, curators, and True Fans.\n\n4/19/22\n\n## The Future of Online Curation\n\nFew people are just browsing the internet. Most are actively searching for things. Every day, Google processes 5.6 billion searches for 5 billion global internet users. The search results we see first are those that are ad supported, relegating the best information “below the fold”. In this scenario, Google and its advertisers win, while users are underserved by search 5.6 billion times per day. Sadly, we’ve grown accustomed to this just being the way it is.\n\nThe number of daily internet searches shows that the internet is an active space for discovery. We’re all looking to discover new ideas, new technology, new art, new music. So why would we tolerate an internet that makes it more difficult to find the best ideas and best information? We shouldn’t.\n\nOne reason why online communities became popular is because they allowed people to meet others like themselves and learn from one another. From blogs to chat rooms to threads, communities have always been where curated conversations have taken place, serving as the best source of information.\n\nOutside of online forums, internet curation is present, but not widely recognized for the value it brings to our online experience. Internet tastemakers are the source of cool internet shit and important instigators of ideas spreading by word of mouth. Depending on how close you are to the source determines how early you are to emerging internet culture, and culture in general.  That said, the value generated by curators is not matched by the compensation they receive for their time. Using music as the example, a large community of internet curators spend hours digging for new music only to receive benefits that are mostly intrinsic and derive from one's ability to say they found it first. What’s needed is a way for this work to be compensated commensurate with the value generated for creators and consumers.\n\nWith blockchain technology, this is now possible.\n\n4/15/22\n\n* Metrics\n  * #submissions\n  * #cosigns received/given\n  * volume of phlote tokens moved\n  * submissions/sale\n  * commissions\n  * reviews/listen\n  * submitter reviews/comments\n  * Value of NFTs sold\n  * OBP -

POS**\n  * Advanced Minting features\n* R**ollout Schedule (DRAFT)**\n  * Stage 0 - Public Launch - Feb 22, 2022 (2.22.22)\n  * Stage 1 - November/December 2022\n  * Stage 2 - August/September 2023\n* Rough Estimate Costs\n  * Stage 1: 30-50K\n  * Stage 2: 40-60K\n  * Stage 3: 60-90k\n  * Grand Total : 130-200k  Spread Over 2 Years\n* **Notes**\n  * Focus on driving demand for curator and artist submissions as a way to support the token. Post curation the listener should ideally be buying NFT's and creating their own playlists.\n  * What is the full depth of our TCR Token mechanics?\n    * Token value is driven by token demand for archive/index inclusion.\n    * Music submissions require tokens.\n    * Curation requires tokens.\n    * As more tokens are purchased/burned through the submission process, value accrues to Phlote Token Holders.\n    * A quality index creates demand to be included in the index, which translates into earnings for curators.\n      * Curators drive value for artists by taking the selling burden off of them.\n      * Should reviews be emotionally driven (how the art made the curator feel)\n        * That commentary could be more valuable than a simple rating and as valuable as providing the historical/cultural context for works.\n  * Dashboard could be used to show number of submissions, percentage reviewed, tokens staked, token inventory, archive.  Maybe we create a music inbox - goal is to get to inbox 0.\n  * Is there a feed?\n  * Are there recommendation engines that advertisers use that could be reframed to present users helpful information based on preferences?\n  * What should we take away from bitclout for our token economics and functionality? Betting on artists early before they even get on the platform - buying value in that artist.\n  * Idea - artists can mint a song as a rare 1 of 1 NFT that can be kept private or added to a public playlist\n    * This makes a whole new economy around rare tracks the artist can release outside of albums.\n    * Artists can put rare 1 of 1 songs on a playlist that is “pay to stream”\n  * If we're encouraging collection/playlisting, then rarity of songs will be a big driver of value and an important part of the ownership experience.  If we assume all curators are DJs that are using the TCR to source music for their sets, then we should absolutely figure out a way for them to be able to monetize their lists and share proceeds with the artists.\n  * One way is to let DJ's play sets and list/link to NFT's that are included in the set.\n  * NFTs owned will also be a part of everyone's profile.\n* **Appendix NOTES: July 31**\n  * Make the experience fun → gamified experience\n  * randomized rewards → builds hype → randomly get 10k\n\n2/17/22\n\nGuests; Saeed Bolden, Singh Cap Partners\n\n2/16/22\n\n* Operating Agreement signed\n* Social media branding updated\n* Guests: Odenz, Yana Sosnovskaya\n\n2/15/22\n\n* TCR Rollout\n  * Email activation + podcast/newsletter\n* Released First Episode of “Curator Call”\n* Polygon Intro\n* Guests: Stefanie Thomas, Sean Wilkes\n\n2/14/22\n\n* Guests: Harrison, Glue, Heno, Carter Brown, Odenz\n\n2/13/22\n\n* Rest Day\n\n2/12/22\n\n* Phlote Search Tokenomics\n  * Curation\n    * Curators buy NFT's and receive PV tokens to participate --> Establishes Eth/PV ratio\n    * Curators mint curation NFTs --> Higher ETH/PV\n    * Curators only gain \"exposure\" to treasury from having submissions staked (co-signed) by other curators.\n    * Unstaked tokens are burned at the end of the period.\n  * Artists\n    * Artists pay to sbmit songs --> Higher ETH/PV\n  * Rankings\n    * Curators ranked by tokens staked (points) and by number of co-signs received\n    * Payouts happen automatically at the end of each epoch.\n* Micro Algorithmic Curation Hedge Funds\n  * Track Record established and tracked.\n  * We curate the Highest Returns.\n  * Consider establishing a 1 week lag on curated versus externally shared content\n  * To start, keep search open and updated it in real time.\n    * Create an index of such quality that artists are compelled to submit.\n    * Maintain Free Search so that the information is always free.\n    * Having a permissionless minting platform underpin our submission process like Mint Split will allow Phlote to personally direct artists to our minting platform to support Phlote tokens and create custom smart contracts that have the following provisions banked in:\n      * social impact royalty\n      * curator credits\n      * automatic inclusion in Phlote Index\n      * Phlote economics - 80/15/5\n* Ranking\n  * Rankings are calculated per period based on points accrued from each curators curation and co-signing activity.\n  * The curator has three token balances\n    * Tokens purchased\n    * Tokens staked\n    * Tokens received\n  * Only tokens staked and received count towards rankings to encourage sharing and co-signing great content that others will enjoy :-)\n    * Some curators may not be compelled by game or social mechanics, preferring to prioritize  the opportunity to archive culture on chain as reward enough.\n  * Token staking rewards.\n    * (Point Multiple/Cost)\n    * Curator (+ 6x PV1)/$.5\n    * First cosigner (+ 5x PV1)/$.25\n    * Second cosigner (+ 4x PV1)/$.25\n    * Third cosigner (+ 3x  PV1)/$.25\n    * Fourth cosigner (+ 2x PV1)/$.25\n    * Firth cosigner (+ 1x PV1)/$.25\n  * PV1 - Phlote Vote 1 Tokens\n  * Those who stake tokens early have highest potential for to accrue points.\n  * Curators who mint submissions are only players who have potential for immediate financial benefit.\n* Rankings and Rewards\n  * Programmatic Rewards:\n    * Phlote Treasury is the reward pool.\n      * Top 3 winners get payouts as below.\n      * All participants have exposure to art portfolio through PV1 holdings.\n    * Continue 1 million token epochs.\n      * Liquid treasury assets (submission fees and curation NFT mint fees) earned over the period get paid out to top 3 curators as follows.\n        * 1st Place - 40%\n        * 2nd Place - 30%\n        * 3rd Place - 20%\n        * Phlote 10% + Yield (fee for Phlote platforms/partner curation)\n* Re-up\n  * At the end of each period, a set of new NFTs is minted and Vickery auctioned to restart the game.\n  * Participants in the current round have a chance to retain membership seat.\n* Revenue opportunities:\n  * This is a curation game that allows members to identify the highest quality digital assets.

We realized early on that our community has great taste. The first artist we identified, Billy Racxx, is now prolific across Web3. Jansport J is now a 2x Grammy nominated artist. Rocky Snyda and JayProb have been unleashed to take over NYC.  We believe in the power of our curation so much,that we’ve started to buy NFTs of the artists our community has introduced us to.\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/lukebars/reflections-ft-dupes->\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/jansportj/grimm>\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/theodoregrams/bad-jawn>\n* Recently, we brought live voting for songs to Twitter spaces. The results have been just as impressive as before, with the added benefits of live programming. We invite you to come join us every Tuesday at 7 pm. Each week’s winner gets minted on Catalog. We pay the gas fee and buy the NFT. We now plan to scale our efforts by opening the opportunity for anyone to participate as we curate and purchase NFT of artists emerging in Web3.\n* As curators, we want to tag the content we fw. Any writer will tell you that the most important thing your tag can carry is respect. Otherwise, there is no value.\n* Collectors of $Tags will have the opportunity to help us decide which artists to #stamp and have incentive to do so. Funds raised through this crowdfund will be directed to the Phlote Treasury, where they will be used to purchase NFTs of the artists we collectively decide to support through our Live Vote Show. Any holder of $Tags will also own shares of Phlote Treasury, giving them financial exposure to the value of the underlying NFTs.\n* 50% of the tokens generated from this Crowdfund will be retained by Phlote to compensate hosts and reward curators.\n* https://zora.co/collections/zora/4341\n* Guests: Silkey, $Grams\n\n2/1/22\n\n* Live Vote Show Winner - [Twerl](https://twitter.com/twerlbeats/status/1488665872763785217?s=20&t=UWXCwlGJ-IIQA_mkjNAB5g)\n* L1 vs L2 Recording -→ [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d75qagaeq3pfzex/L1%3AL2.m4a?dl=0)\n* FUTRxLGND Live Vote Show January 8th OS NYC\n* Calls: Sheed, Merna Maker (Seed Club), Russ Ballard (40 Acres DAO)\n\n1/31/22\n\n* [Partner Meeting](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtlllwlcsscdjo5/Partner%20Call%20%281.31.22%29.mp4?dl=0)\n* Scheduling Season 1 of a Podcast Series we’re calling “Curator Call”\n  * 8 - 12 week season\n  * February 15 Release\n* Calls: Bob Fisk (Seed Club)\n\n1/30/22\n\n* Calls: Rome Fortune\n\n1/29/22\n\n* Phlote TCR\n  * Design Curator Cards - 5150/KB\n  * Co-signs are comments/stamps.\n    * Stamps rev goes to original curator.\n    * Mint fees goes to Phlote DAO to support token.\n* Phlote OS Apps\n  * Read, Watch, Listen (Blog/Syllabus, Office, Secret)\n  * Three roles - artist, curator, collector\n  * Add role select to the website that highlights different apps - unlocked by specific tokens\n  * Edit and send videos to ArifHallway Genesis Mints\n* Finish Newsletter\n  * Add Roadmap\n  * Topic Fully Transparent Business Model + Community\n* Letters - Curator Club, Broad Email List\n  * Curator Club - Partners + SC/Mirror Support + At Large\n* Phlote Partner Call added to Google Calendar\n* Explore minting a snapshot the business once weekly.\n  * Cohorts, stats, etc.\n  * Link with Lia C. on data visualization\n  * Weekly Cohorts (Indexed as ETF’s)\n* Reach out to top 55 artists to mint on mint split.\n  * Phlote pays gas\n* (1+1) = ♾\n\n1/28/22\n\n* Phlote OS\n  * Close out block color\n  * Edit and send videos to Arif\n  * Wallpaper rendering\n  * Airtable link\n  * “Artist name” + flashlight in search bar\n  * Circle Blinker\n  * Dante - Let’s start to test contracts\n  * Look for Jitsi to mint integration\n  * Is Private Vickrey Auction possible on Mirror\n  * Saba - Marketplace designs for Mint Split\n  * Artist Index Page\n* Phote TCR\n  * How do we track and show wallet addresses captured?

Very early, it was obvious to us that artists x crypto was a good idea, enabling independent artists to get paid and retain creative control without requiring them to give away their rights. We immediately saw the opportunity to support up & coming artists in new ways. Two years of research and experimentation have taught us a thing or two. We now know where we fit and see an opportunity to tell our story.

{"id": "dEanjsvPxOgf4JkU0ODZoVo2slmwMO0lYjcMffNBEYU", "title": "Phlote Business Day", "body": "6/11/22\n\nWe DESERVE Open Source Music\n\nCopyright law has constrained the music industry for too long. Worrying about rights management and their oversight has the potential to derail music on the internet going froward. Let’s give it up and figure out a new model. \n\nIn fact, we have great examples of how an industry that was once a form of entertainment is now becoming a form of expression. Look at gaming. \n\nMusic is begging to be open source. Hip hop music has been built on sampling and unleashed an uprecentedented era of creativity, albeit with many legal hurdles , and much litigation.  As we enter the phase of the internet where creators are at the center, why not encourage creativity instead of stifle it.\n\nTo do that, we’ll have to get past the idea that music is untouchable. \n\nMore generally, we’ll should also move past the notion that every creative idea needs to be 100% original. In fact, that’s impossible. Every idea is linked to multiple references and many influences. Ideas are composable.\n\nThe music industry may never understand this or relinquish control over protections  that power their business, expecailly after the catalog buying spree we’ve seen recently.  Could this be where Web3 steps up?  If we’re building new infrastructure to encourage massive global collaboration, why should music be left out. \n\nFUCK COPYRIGHTS\n\nOpen Source Music admits that all music exists along a cointuum of ideass that are connected and welcomes more participants to the party. Blockchain technology allows a rich web of content to be captured around the original work to create a rich experience to measure the true cultural value of a work. All comments, fan art, reaction videos, and social media can be linked to show the true culturual value of a song. The crowd matters. A public history   A user generated ecosystem that forms a new culture of openness and sharing. \n\nEvery idea is borrowed. Every published work is a rough draft. Lets increase the pace of innovation, use music to showcae whats possible using this technology. Music makes us feel something.  Why not let everyone express that.\n\nThis token will be used to build a user generated ecosystem for music that forges a new culture of opennes and sharing. We’ll also support any platofrm that supports this and ask any partners that are building towards the same future to join us\n\n\\#001 Genesis Tokens for our founding partners. \n\n1000 Tokens available  x 1 ETH\n\n[https://zora.co/collections/zora/4341](https://zora.co/collections/zora/4341)\n\n5/12/22\n\n1. Generative art marketplace\n2. Curated drop marketplace\n3. Mixtape marketplace - record store feel w/editorial\n4. Distributed Bandcamp w/ bespoke artists marketplaces\n\n5/11/22\n\nGuests: Michael Norman, Dee Goens\n\n5/2/22\n\nEverything is moving towards Open Source.\n\nOpen Source Work, Open Source Music, everything will be open to be reused, remixed…I believe. DAOs are open source projects with a token.  The largest companies being built in Web3 rn will have characteristics that are gleaned from decades of open source development.\n\nWe’ve been headed this direction, but now have a framework to follow. The open source movement has been around for 40 years. Lots of examples on how to build product with community.\n\n[https://future.a16z.com/open-source-community-commercialization/](https://future.a16z.com/open-source-community-commercialization/)\n\nOther insights:  Interest circle are about to dominate social circles. Social media for interests.\n\n4/29/22\n\nPhlote is a community-owned and operated music discovery platform. The value of Phlote is the sum total of our community contributions. Our ability to curate talented artists into Web3 is reflected in the value of our unique social token, $PV1, which gives every member of Team Phlote an economic stake in its growth.\n\nTo facilitate the growth of our community, we've built a music TCR as a merit based community onboarding tool. created an open submission process that allows any music fan with an internet connection and a crypto wallet to earn $PV1 tokens for curating music on Phlote.xyz.\n\nWe're opening the door for people with a keen eye for talent to distinguish themselves as leading curatorial voices in Web3.\n\nHow do people get these tokens?\n\nEach day, our community members scan the music submissions on Phlote.xyz and co-sign the songs they like. Curators who receive co-signs, earn $PV1 tokens and earn the right to have a profile on Phlote.xyz to start building their track record.\n\nThis effort ensures Team Phlote controls how the community grows and helps guarantee that our path towards a truly community-owned platform - where curators are the owners and operators of the network - is in line with the open, transparent, and permission-less ethos of blockchain technology.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. $PV1 isn’t available for purchase and can only be earned through submission at Phlote.xyz.\n2. $PV1 will be distributed to anyone who submits music at Phlote.xyz and receives co-signs from current members of the community.\n3. Curators earn 15 $PV1 for each co-sign received.\n4. Curators earn higher status within the community as they earn more $PV1 tokens. 1 co-sign earns the right to have a unique profile on Phlote. Curators who earn 20 co-signs (300 $PV1) earn the right to become co-signers.\n5. The game will last until the total supply of 1,000,000 $PV1 tokens has been fully distributed to members of the community.\n\nThe Goal?\n\n1. To surface up-and-coming voices at the cross section of music and technology.\n2. To introduce the world's most talented, independent artists to the blockchain.\n3. To build Team Phlote into an elite community of artists and curators who will create the world's leading music discovery platform.\n\n4/27/22\n\nOur #1 Priority: A custom auction house that sells NFT editions at Vickrey Auction. All NFT editions are sold in rounds with preference given to DAO contributors. Phlote to test auction mechanics with NFT sale that decentralizes marketplace on Day 1.\n\n4/25/22\n\nThe full potential for Web3 are products that are 100% built, operated, and owned by the community around them. Platforms that are open for anyone to join, have a clear mission, and a value orientation. These platforms will be structured as user owned companies or DAOs.\n\nIn the music industry, many artists must fight to be heard. Music discovery is not designed to showcase the many talented vocalists, musicians, producers, songwriters who exist in the world, but should.\n\nWe propose a system that centers artists, curators, and collectors as the backbone of the music industry. One that incentivizes the discovery of new music, makes it easily sharable, and help artists to identify their core fans. This alternative path that allows great music to be heard and doesn’t require artists to sign away their creative rights or ownership to labels.\n\nThe opportunity allows a new set of internet users to participate. Now anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can earn tokens for phloting great music to Web3.\n\n4/20/22\n\nSome believe that music discovery is alive and well in the hands of streaming platforms like Spotify.  We disagree.\n\n1. Today music discovery is not happening for independent artists on streaming platforms. Sixty thousand songs are uploaded daily. Only major label supported artists get seen. The system is broken.\n2. Algorithms are an inferior way to spur word of mouth spread for indie artists. Human recommendations reign supreme in music discovery.\n3. The True Fans looking to find new music are coming to Web3 for the ability to discover new artists and buy in early via NFTs. Adding crypto may prove difficult for incumbent music platforms to implement.\n4. Users will begin to migrate to platforms that they help build, use, and co-own as a community. Spotify is not likely to revolutionize a business model that has been profitable for the executive team and shareholders.\n\nPhlote is designed to solve these issues for artists, curators, and True Fans.\n\n4/19/22\n\n## The Future of Online Curation\n\nFew people are just browsing the internet. Most are actively searching for things. Every day, Google processes 5.6 billion searches for 5 billion global internet users. The search results we see first are those that are ad supported, relegating the best information “below the fold”. In this scenario, Google and its advertisers win, while users are underserved by search 5.6 billion times per day. Sadly, we’ve grown accustomed to this just being the way it is.\n\nThe number of daily internet searches shows that the internet is an active space for discovery. We’re all looking to discover new ideas, new technology, new art, new music. So why would we tolerate an internet that makes it more difficult to find the best ideas and best information? We shouldn’t.\n\nOne reason why online communities became popular is because they allowed people to meet others like themselves and learn from one another. From blogs to chat rooms to threads, communities have always been where curated conversations have taken place, serving as the best source of information.\n\nOutside of online forums, internet curation is present, but not widely recognized for the value it brings to our online experience. Internet tastemakers are the source of cool internet shit and important instigators of ideas spreading by word of mouth. Depending on how close you are to the source determines how early you are to emerging internet culture, and culture in general.  That said, the value generated by curators is not matched by the compensation they receive for their time. Using music as the example, a large community of internet curators spend hours digging for new music only to receive benefits that are mostly intrinsic and derive from one's ability to say they found it first. What’s needed is a way for this work to be compensated commensurate with the value generated for creators and consumers.\n\nWith blockchain technology, this is now possible.\n\n4/15/22\n\n* Metrics\n  * #submissions\n  * #cosigns received/given\n  * volume of phlote tokens moved\n  * submissions/sale\n  * commissions\n  * reviews/listen\n  * submitter reviews/comments\n  * Value of NFTs sold\n  * OBP -

Post curation the listener should ideally be buying NFT's and creating their own playlists.\n  * What is the full depth of our TCR Token mechanics?\n    * Token value is driven by token demand for archive/index inclusion.\n    * Music submissions require tokens.\n    * Curation requires tokens.\n    * As more tokens are purchased/burned through the submission process, value accrues to Phlote Token Holders.\n    * A quality index creates demand to be included in the index, which translates into earnings for curators.\n      * Curators drive value for artists by taking the selling burden off of them.\n      * Should reviews be emotionally driven (how the art made the curator feel)\n        * That commentary could be more valuable than a simple rating and as valuable as providing the historical/cultural context for works.\n  * Dashboard could be used to show number of submissions, percentage reviewed, tokens staked, token inventory, archive.  Maybe we create a music inbox - goal is to get to inbox 0.\n  * Is there a feed?\n  * Are there recommendation engines that advertisers use that could be reframed to present users helpful information based on preferences?\n  * What should we take away from bitclout for our token economics and functionality? Betting on artists early before they even get on the platform - buying value in that artist.\n  * Idea - artists can mint a song as a rare 1 of 1 NFT that can be kept private or added to a public playlist\n    * This makes a whole new economy around rare tracks the artist can release outside of albums.\n    * Artists can put rare 1 of 1 songs on a playlist that is “pay to stream”\n  * If we're encouraging collection/playlisting, then rarity of songs will be a big driver of value and an important part of the ownership experience.  If we assume all curators are DJs that are using the TCR to source music for their sets, then we should absolutely figure out a way for them to be able to monetize their lists and share proceeds with the artists.\n  * One way is to let DJ's play sets and list/link to NFT's that are included in the set.\n  * NFTs owned will also be a part of everyone's profile.\n* **Appendix NOTES: July 31**\n  * Make the experience fun → gamified experience\n  * randomized rewards → builds hype → randomly get 10k\n\n2/17/22\n\nGuests; Saeed Bolden, Singh Cap Partners\n\n2/16/22\n\n* Operating Agreement signed\n* Social media branding updated\n* Guests: Odenz, Yana Sosnovskaya\n\n2/15/22\n\n* TCR Rollout\n  * Email activation + podcast/newsletter\n* Released First Episode of “Curator Call”\n* Polygon Intro\n* Guests: Stefanie Thomas, Sean Wilkes\n\n2/14/22\n\n* Guests: Harrison, Glue, Heno, Carter Brown, Odenz\n\n2/13/22\n\n* Rest Day\n\n2/12/22\n\n* Phlote Search Tokenomics\n  * Curation\n    * Curators buy NFT's and receive PV tokens to participate --> Establishes Eth/PV ratio\n    * Curators mint curation NFTs --> Higher ETH/PV\n    * Curators only gain \"exposure\" to treasury from having submissions staked (co-signed) by other curators.\n    * Unstaked tokens are burned at the end of the period.\n  * Artists\n    * Artists pay to sbmit songs --> Higher ETH/PV\n  * Rankings\n    * Curators ranked by tokens staked (points) and by number of co-signs received\n    * Payouts happen automatically at the end of each epoch.\n* Micro Algorithmic Curation Hedge Funds\n  * Track Record established and tracked.\n  * We curate the Highest Returns.\n  * Consider establishing a 1 week lag on curated versus externally shared content\n  * To start, keep search open and updated it in real time.\n    * Create an index of such quality that artists are compelled to submit.\n    * Maintain Free Search so that the information is always free.\n    * Having a permissionless minting platform underpin our submission process like Mint Split will allow Phlote to personally direct artists to our minting platform to support Phlote tokens and create custom smart contracts that have the following provisions banked in:\n      * social impact royalty\n      * curator credits\n      * automatic inclusion in Phlote Index\n      * Phlote economics - 80/15/5\n* Ranking\n  * Rankings are calculated per period based on points accrued from each curators curation and co-signing activity.\n  * The curator has three token balances\n    * Tokens purchased\n    * Tokens staked\n    * Tokens received\n  * Only tokens staked and received count towards rankings to encourage sharing and co-signing great content that others will enjoy :-)\n    * Some curators may not be compelled by game or social mechanics, preferring to prioritize  the opportunity to archive culture on chain as reward enough.\n  * Token staking rewards.\n    * (Point Multiple/Cost)\n    * Curator (+ 6x PV1)/$.5\n    * First cosigner (+ 5x PV1)/$.25\n    * Second cosigner (+ 4x PV1)/$.25\n    * Third cosigner (+ 3x  PV1)/$.25\n    * Fourth cosigner (+ 2x PV1)/$.25\n    * Firth cosigner (+ 1x PV1)/$.25\n  * PV1 - Phlote Vote 1 Tokens\n  * Those who stake tokens early have highest potential for to accrue points.\n  * Curators who mint submissions are only players who have potential for immediate financial benefit.\n* Rankings and Rewards\n  * Programmatic Rewards:\n    * Phlote Treasury is the reward pool.\n      * Top 3 winners get payouts as below.\n      * All participants have exposure to art portfolio through PV1 holdings.\n    * Continue 1 million token epochs.\n      * Liquid treasury assets (submission fees and curation NFT mint fees) earned over the period get paid out to top 3 curators as follows.\n        * 1st Place - 40%\n        * 2nd Place - 30%\n        * 3rd Place - 20%\n        * Phlote 10% + Yield (fee for Phlote platforms/partner curation)\n* Re-up\n  * At the end of each period, a set of new NFTs is minted and Vickery auctioned to restart the game.\n  * Participants in the current round have a chance to retain membership seat.\n* Revenue opportunities:\n  * This is a curation game that allows members to identify the highest quality digital assets.

We realized early on that our community has great taste. The first artist we identified, Billy Racxx, is now prolific across Web3. Jansport J is now a 2x Grammy nominated artist. Rocky Snyda and JayProb have been unleashed to take over NYC.  We believe in the power of our curation so much,that we’ve started to buy NFTs of the artists our community has introduced us to.\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/lukebars/reflections-ft-dupes->\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/jansportj/grimm>\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/theodoregrams/bad-jawn>\n* Recently, we brought live voting for songs to Twitter spaces. The results have been just as impressive as before, with the added benefits of live programming. We invite you to come join us every Tuesday at 7 pm. Each week’s winner gets minted on Catalog. We pay the gas fee and buy the NFT. We now plan to scale our efforts by opening the opportunity for anyone to participate as we curate and purchase NFT of artists emerging in Web3.\n* As curators, we want to tag the content we fw. Any writer will tell you that the most important thing your tag can carry is respect. Otherwise, there is no value.\n* Collectors of $Tags will have the opportunity to help us decide which artists to #stamp and have incentive to do so. Funds raised through this crowdfund will be directed to the Phlote Treasury, where they will be used to purchase NFTs of the artists we collectively decide to support through our Live Vote Show. Any holder of $Tags will also own shares of Phlote Treasury, giving them financial exposure to the value of the underlying NFTs.\n* 50% of the tokens generated from this Crowdfund will be retained by Phlote to compensate hosts and reward curators.\n* https://zora.co/collections/zora/4341\n* Guests: Silkey, $Grams\n\n2/1/22\n\n* Live Vote Show Winner - [Twerl](https://twitter.com/twerlbeats/status/1488665872763785217?s=20&t=UWXCwlGJ-IIQA_mkjNAB5g)\n* L1 vs L2 Recording -→ [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d75qagaeq3pfzex/L1%3AL2.m4a?dl=0)\n* FUTRxLGND Live Vote Show January 8th OS NYC\n* Calls: Sheed, Merna Maker (Seed Club), Russ Ballard (40 Acres DAO)\n\n1/31/22\n\n* [Partner Meeting](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtlllwlcsscdjo5/Partner%20Call%20%281.31.22%29.mp4?dl=0)\n* Scheduling Season 1 of a Podcast Series we’re calling “Curator Call”\n  * 8 - 12 week season\n  * February 15 Release\n* Calls: Bob Fisk (Seed Club)\n\n1/30/22\n\n* Calls: Rome Fortune\n\n1/29/22\n\n* Phlote TCR\n  * Design Curator Cards - 5150/KB\n  * Co-signs are comments/stamps.\n    * Stamps rev goes to original curator.\n    * Mint fees goes to Phlote DAO to support token.\n* Phlote OS Apps\n  * Read, Watch, Listen (Blog/Syllabus, Office, Secret)\n  * Three roles - artist, curator, collector\n  * Add role select to the website that highlights different apps - unlocked by specific tokens\n  * Edit and send videos to ArifHallway Genesis Mints\n* Finish Newsletter\n  * Add Roadmap\n  * Topic Fully Transparent Business Model + Community\n* Letters - Curator Club, Broad Email List\n  * Curator Club - Partners + SC/Mirror Support + At Large\n* Phlote Partner Call added to Google Calendar\n* Explore minting a snapshot the business once weekly.\n  * Cohorts, stats, etc.\n  * Link with Lia C. on data visualization\n  * Weekly Cohorts (Indexed as ETF’s)\n* Reach out to top 55 artists to mint on mint split.\n  * Phlote pays gas\n* (1+1) = ♾\n\n1/28/22\n\n* Phlote OS\n  * Close out block color\n  * Edit and send videos to Arif\n  * Wallpaper rendering\n  * Airtable link\n  * “Artist name” + flashlight in search bar\n  * Circle Blinker\n  * Dante - Let’s start to test contracts\n  * Look for Jitsi to mint integration\n  * Is Private Vickrey Auction possible on Mirror\n  * Saba - Marketplace designs for Mint Split\n  * Artist Index Page\n* Phote TCR\n  * How do we track and show wallet addresses captured?

{"id": "Iz6ftM48niT-BbjIcQ2bd3BNixuugjPGxiv2LrS_ERI", "title": "Here Come the Metaverse Cartels (a first draft)", "body": "Author and journalist Julian Dibbell recorded the following statement from a cartel informant in a book he published in 2006: \n\n*“That’s the ugly side of \\[the game\\]… a side I prefer not to get involved with. Those guys are serious people… I would love nothing more than to see them all rot in prison, but I would fear for the safety of my family if they found out I told anyone.”*\n\nIt seems like standard mafia fare, but “those guys” referred to here weren’t managing construction rackets or laundering money. **They were actually gathering gold coins in the virtual world of *Ultima Online*, one of the first big multiplayer roleplaying games.** The book, *Play Money*, details the drama of making money while rival gold cartels compete for turf in Brittania, the fictional setting of the game.\n\nThe idea of nerd mafias duking it out seems comical. Frankly, it often is. But the money involved is real, and when the sums get large enough, people are willing to protect it. One racketeer named “Destiny” suggested he would show up at the scammer’s real-world house with a weapon when he got ripped off for several hundred dollars. “F\\*\\*k, I don’t care. I used to live in Long Beach right in the heart of the riots. I don’t give a f\\*\\*k. I will go packing \\[a gun\\] too.”\n\nIt doesn’t appear Destiny made good on his threats toward this particular scammer, but he did destroy a competing cartel when they moved in on his poultry sales. You read that right. Called “running birds,” users would set up automated characters called “bots” to purchase 300 units of raw poultry from a butcher, cook it all, and sell the resulting mountain of delicious avian goodness to a tavern keeper. The total profit for each round was six gold pieces. It doesn’t sound like much, but by automating the process, one bot could make 500,000 gold pieces running birds each hour. Those could then be turned around and sold on eBay for about $6.50. (At this time, it was still allowed.) With just four bots running, and each going 24 hours a day, there was potentially $18,720 worth of gold pieces being generated each month.\n\nBut the prices were unstable. When the aforementioned Destiny encountered “the EasyUO Cartel,” an international group of coders also making money through *Ultima Online*, he realized there was an opportunity. \n\n*“…if the REAL producers…you and us… were to begin working together, not bulls\\*\\*\\*ting, we would literally control the entire supply. That coupled with extreme prejudice on the price structure, you would see a dramatic increase in price.”*\n\nThis is precisely cartel behavior. And while it’s not a well-known phenomenon, virtual cartels do seem to emerge regularly when in-game resources acquire “real-world” value. \n\nTake the example of the “Black Lotus Mafia.” The black lotus is the rarest of herbs in *World of Warcraft Classic*, and if you want to make some of the most powerful flasks in the game, you’ll need some. Raiding guilds often required their members to be stocked up with them, so there was a constant need for more. Black lotus, however, only appeared in a few specific places in the virtual world, and not terribly often.\n\nSensing the opportunity, a group of players banded together to snag them as soon as they appeared. They were well organized and very effective. For months, if competitors (or just ordinary players) attempted to camp the spots where a lotus would appear, bots would arrive and circle the spawn point so no human-run player could click on it and claim it. Truly diabolical. From there, the mafia bought up all other listings for black lotuses in the auction house and set their price at about 300 gold per blossom. (That much gold was worth approximately $18 on the Internet black market.) Bit by bit, the Black Lotus Mafia juiced the high-level citizens of Azeroth for their gold. \n\nEnter Loknar, a priest in *WoW Classic* that had it up to *here* with high-priced loti. Loknar organized a virtual protest in the city of Orgrimmar. “There were over 500 people doing a line walk and yelling,” he reported to Wired. Realizing the danger he posed, the mafia had him whacked. The bots all reported him to Blizzard, the game developer, for “abusive chat,” and Loknar was temporarily locked out of the game.\n\nBlizzard eventually got wise to the mafia and stepped in, drowning the racketeers in surplus flowers. They increased the rate at which the lotuses would appear, and set up many new locations as well. The tactic worked. Blizzard broke the icy grip the mafia had on the aquatic plant racket and crashed the price in the auction house by about 87%. They also suspended or removed many thousands of accounts they believed were botting. There are still whispers and rumors about back-alley deals to corner the Devilsaur leather market, but for now the *WoW Classic* mafiosi are staying low relative to how things were in 2020.\n\n \n \n\n#### How inevitable are they?\n\nThese are but two examples, and others are easy to find. The most common are probably in *EVE Online*, where frankly, pretty much anything short of real-life murder is fair play anyway. The point is that it just doesn’t matter what sort of world we’re talking about, virtual or physical: when a valuable resource is in the hands of only a few people, they often collude to fix prices at an inflated value. It requires only four things:\n\n* Limited resources\n* A willingness to collude among the people who control those resources\n* Authorities that can’t or won’t stop the collusion\n* Buyers in need of the goods\n\nSo, here’s my question to you: Why shouldn’t we assume that Metaverse cartels are coming? All four conditions are quickly coming together.\n\nWith the launch of *Illuvium*’s land sale earlier this month, we saw a continuing trend of land that generates usable, salable resources. Prior to them, *Axie Infinity* had announced their land would generate resources. *Worldwide Webb* is also bringing resource generation into play. And by far the largest player of all, *Otherside*, has both items and many different kinds of resources being generated by their land. It seems likely at this point that more projects will soon follow suit, as it provides even more incentive to purchase their virtual land.\n\nOnly time will tell how much such resources will be worth. But, it seems that not much would be needed to get people interested. We saw the “Smooth Love Potions” generated within *Axie Infinity* resulting in an incredible amount of interest last year for just a few cents each. Imagining several of the higher-tier landowners in *Otherside* colluding to raise the price of the rare “dimensional” resources isn’t out of the question. Depending on their level of utility, buyers wanting to make use of these resources may end up like the black lotus users in *World of Warcraft.* Many were without a choice: they needed them to participate in the highest-level content.\n\nSo, we have limited resources. We have a reasonable assumption, but admittedly not certainty, that there will be both buyers in need of them and sellers willing to collude with each other. The only matter remaining is authorities that either can’t or won’t stop the collusion. And, this is where the Metaverse is particularly vulnerable. \n\nIn the case of the “Black Lotus Mafia,” Blizzard could step in and delete their accounts and possessions. They could also unilaterally flood the market to destroy lotus farming’s profitability. But it’s unclear what, if anything, metaverse projects can do to stop users from doing things that negatively affect the platform. \n\nIt would seem that one thing they *can’t* do is dispossess the cartel members of their land. Transferring an NFT out of someone’s wallet requires a signature at some step in the process. Without the owner’s consent, the NFT remains in their possession. It would seem that the people running the platform could prevent the wallet user from logging into the game, but then what happens to the land? Is it just left blank in perpetuity — until the NFT representing it is in someone else’s possession? \n\nPlus, it remains an open question whether a developer could or would intervene at all. Perhaps banning decisions are designated to a DAO rather than in the developer’s purview. Perhaps the party who can stop cartel members from participating isn’t competent, or doesn’t care. The point of the matter is that a profitable cartel won’t stop on their own — ask OPEC — and requires a capable and motivated authority to make it happen. Even if these are all in place, they would need to be consistently operational. It would seem that, given a span of years, there would be at least a few months where the defenses are down on at least one platform enough such that a cartel may appear.\n\nAll in all, it seems that such anti-competitive behavior and racketeering is inevitable. There will be at least some. Possibly a lot. If we’ve seen them develop in less profit-oriented virtual environments than modern metaverse projects, why wouldn’t we see them there as well? I feel nearly completely certain we will.\n\n#### Implications\n\nOne of the themes I find myself writing about repeatedly is the damage that bad actors can cause in a decentralized environment. Any time control is moved away from a central authority, there’s a concern that systems will break down. The concerns that these new technologies and the people who use them will be horribly damaged by people with bad intentions is both reasonable and a bad reason to avoid the change.\n\nThe promise of Web3 is to deliver control of vital social institutions to transparent code (law) and its users, away from empowered individuals. It is the continuation of a trend that has been with us since the development of civilization. As time passes, authority is distributed. And, as a result of that distribution, life tends to improve. Few people believe that the world was not improved by the movement of rule from kings to elected representatives. When everyone could own land, and not just the nobility class, we found that things were better.\n\nAs the structures of policing and governance melt and spread, there will surely be those who will take advantage of the situation. When the opportunity presents itself, they will organize and try to exploit it. There’s nothing new or suprising about racketeers. So, we should be ready for that, even in this new virtual context. History already makes it clear that the gap between digital and analog worlds is not a sufficient barrier to keep them out. So, here they come. Luckily for us, as surely as the creation of new digital resources and decentralized control structures will sprout them, they are not sufficient to stop the broader movement.", "timestamp": 1655169800, "digest": "gEuJX1SiDys7s8LLnRoODUHHV0LqLHIN8iXoJvDGb0E", "contributor": "0xaBCb2691C5Ef6Bc868D7d103045cbBDB30244670"}

It is created by a judge to correct a circumstance in which one party acquires something at the expense of the other.1\n\nThe contract aims to prevent one party from unfairly benefiting from the situation at the other party's expense. These arrangements may be imposed when goods or services are accepted, though not requested, by a party. The acceptance then creates an expectation of [payment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payment.asp).1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A quasi contract is a retroactive arrangement between two parties who have no previous obligations to one another.\n* It is created by a judge to correct a circumstance in which one party acquires something at the expense of the other.\n* The plaintiff must have furnished a tangible item or service to another party with the expectation or implication that payment would be given.\n* The defendant must have accepted, or acknowledged receipt of, the item but made no effort or offer to pay for it.\n\n## Understanding Quasi Contracts\n\nQuasi contracts outline the obligation of one party to another when the latter is in possession of the original party's property. These parties may not necessarily have had a prior agreement with one another. The agreement is imposed by law through a judge as a remedy when Person A owes something to Person B because they come into possession of Person A's property indirectly or by mistake. The contract becomes enforceable if Person B decides to keep the item in question without paying for it.\n\nBecause the agreement is constructed in a court of law, it is legally enforceable, so neither party has to agree to it.1 The purpose of the quasi contract is to render a fair outcome in a situation where one party has an advantage over another. The defendant—the party who acquired the property—must pay restitution to the plaintiff who is the wronged party to cover the [value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp) of the item.\n\nA quasi contract is also known as [an implied contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/implied_contract.asp). It would be handed down ordering the defendant to pay restitution to the plaintiff. The restitution, known in Latin as *quantum meruit,* or the amount earned*,* is calculated according to the amount or extent to which the defendant was unjustly enriched.21\n\nThese contracts are also referred to as constructive contracts as they are created when there is no existing contract between the two parties involved. If there is an agreement already in place, though, a quasi contract generally cannot be enforced.\n\nA quasi contract is a court-imposed document designed to prevent one party from unfairly benefiting at another party's expense, even though no contract exists between them.1\n\n## Example of a Quasi Contract\n\nA classic quasi contract circumstance may be created by the delivery of a pizza to the wrong address—that is, not to the person who paid for it. If the individual at the incorrect address fails to fess to the error and instead keeps the pizza, they could be seen as having accepted the food, and thus be obliged to pay for it. A court could then rule to issue a quasi contract that requires the pizza recipient to pay back the cost of the food to the party who purchased it or to the pizzeria if it subsequently delivered a second pie to the purchaser. The restitution mandated under the quasi contract aims for a fair resolution of the situation.\n\n## Requirements for a Quasi Contract\n\nCertain aspects must be in place for a judge to issue a quasi contract:\n\n* One party, the [plaintiff](https://www.investopedia.com/laws-and-regulations-4427769), must have furnished a tangible item or service to another party, or the defendant, with the expectation or implication that payment would be given.\n* The defendant must have accepted—or acknowledged receipt of—the item of value, but made no effort or offer to pay for it.\n* The plaintiff must then express why it is unjust for the defendant to receive the good or service without paying for it. In other words, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant received unjust enrichment.3\n\nConsidering the example above, the individual who ordered the pizza and paid for it would have every right to demand payment from the individual who actually received the pizza—the first individual being the plaintiff, the latter being the defendant.\n\n## Quasi Contract History\n\nUnder common-law jurisdictions, quasi contracts originated in the Middle Ages under a form of action known in Latin as *indebitatus assumpsit,* which translates to being indebted or to have undertaken a debt.3 This legal principle was the courts' way of making one party pay the other as if a contract or agreement already existed between them. So the defendant’s obligation to be bound by the contract is seen as implied by law. From its earliest uses, the quasi contract was typically imposed to enforce restitution obligations.\n\n### \n\n*Unjust enrichment is what happens when an individual benefits from a situation inappropriately, either because of luck or because of another person's bad fortune.4*\n\n## Quasi Contract FAQs\n\n### What Is a Quasi Contract in Law?\n\nA quasi contract is an after-the-fact contract between two parties who were otherwise not in a legal commitment to one another. This kind of contract is mandated by a judge seeking to address a situation where one party benefited from something at the expense of the other.\n\n### What Are the Elements of a Quasi Contract?\n\nThe plaintiff has to have provided an item or service to either the defendant or another party with the expectation of getting paid. The defendant has to have accepted the item or service without attempting to pay for it. Finally, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant should not have received the item for free and that doing so constitutes \"unjust enrichment.\"\n\n### What Are the Kinds of Quasi Contracts?\n\nA quasi contract is also known as an \"implied contract,\" in which a defendant is ordered to pay restitution to the plaintiff, or a constructive contract, meaning a contract that is put into existence when no such contract between the parties exists.\n\n### What Is a Quasi Contract Example?\n\nAn example might be if Person A offers to pay Person B to help them move to a new apartment, and agrees to pay the $100 for the help. The agreement is verbal and not a formal contract. Person B commits to the job, turns down a different job, and shows up on the required day to help with the move. But when Person B shows up, Person A tells them that they are not needed after all and that the job is canceled. Person B files a civil suit to have the missing money paid and a quasi contract might be instituted, if the judge agrees that money is owed.\n\n### What Is a Quasi Delict Example?\n\nA quasi delict is when a wrong occurs accidentally, such as negligence, versus a true delict, which is when a wrong occurs deliberately.5\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nWith a quasi contract, a defendant is required to behave as if there was a legal contract with the plaintiff. It is designed so that one party is not unjustly enriched at the expense of the other. Unjust enrichment is when someone benefits unfairly, either due to circumstance or the other party's misfortune. A quasi contract is rendered by a judge, as a settlement, after the fact, when a formal contract otherwise did not exist.", "timestamp": 1655169889, "digest": "diXSoWUGC3x6W949FG7Cspky3j3wrYZlQFMAATVV3bI", "contributor": "0xf12D9484B42BCBB6AE338566aa1C17254460dEDe"}
{"id": "U8_2IMm4exqcdgW327RMDkkMaJ2Z2SCV1T0xfZvQLfI", "title": "Quick Assets", "body": "## What Are Quick Assets?\n\nQuick assets refer to assets owned by a company with a commercial or exchange value that can easily be converted into cash or that are already in a cash form. Quick assets are therefore considered to be the most highly [liquid assets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/what-items-are-considered-liquid-assets.asp) held by a company. They include cash and equivalents, [marketable securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp), and accounts receivable. Companies use quick assets to calculate certain financial ratios that are used in decision making, primarily the [quick ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quickratio.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Current and quick assets are two categories from the balance sheet that analysts use to examine a company’s liquidity.\n* Quick assets are equal to the summation of a company’s cash and equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable which are all assets that represent or can be easily converted to cash.\n* Quick assets are considered to be a more conservative measure of a company's liquidity than current assets since it excludes inventories.\n* The quick ratio is used to analyze a company's immediate ability to pay its current liabilities without the need to sell its inventory or use financing.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 18 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:18\n\n#### Quick Assets\n\n## The Basics of Quick Assets\n\nUnlike other types of [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp), quick assets represent economic resources that can be turned into cash in a relatively short period of time without a significant loss of value. Cash and cash equivalents are the most liquid current asset items included in quick assets, while marketable securities and accounts receivable are also considered to be quick assets. Quick assets exclude [inventories](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp), because it may take more time for a company to convert them into cash.\n\nCompanies typically keep some portion of their quick assets in the form of cash and marketable securities as a buffer to meet their immediate operating, investing, or financing needs. A company that has a low cash balance in its quick assets may satisfy its need for liquidity by tapping into its available lines of credit.\n\nDepending on the nature of a business and the industry in which it operates, a substantial portion of quick assets may be tied to accounts receivable. For example, companies that sell products and services to corporate clients may have large accounts receivable balances, while retail companies that sell products to individual consumers may have negligible accounts receivable on their balance sheets.\n\n## Example of Quick Assets: The Quick Ratio\n\nAnalysts most often use quick assets to assess a company's ability to satisfy its immediate bills and obligations that are due within a one-year period. The total amount of quick assets is used in the quick ratio, sometimes referred to as the acid test, which is a financial ratio that divides the sum of a company's cash and equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable by its [current liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp). This ratio allows investment professionals to determine whether a company can meet its financial obligations if its revenues or cash collections happen to slow down.\n\nThe formula for the quick ratio is:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\\\frac { \\\\text{C \\\\& E} + \\\\text{MS} + \\\\text{AR} }{ \\\\text{Current Liabilities} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{C \\\\& E} = \\\\text{cash \\\\& equivalents} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{MS} = \\\\text{marketable securities} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{AR} = \\\\text{accounts receivable} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Quick Ratio=Current LiabilitiesC & E+MS+AR​where:C & E=cash & equivalentsMS=marketable securitiesAR=accounts receivable​﻿\n\nor\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\\\frac { \\\\text{CA} - \\\\text{Inventory} - \\\\text{PE} }{ \\\\text{Current Liabilities} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CA} = \\\\text{current assets} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{PE} = \\\\text{prepaid expenses} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Quick Ratio=Current LiabilitiesCA−Inventory−PE​where:CA=current assetsPE=prepaid expenses​﻿\n\n## Quick Assets Versus Current Assets\n\nQuick assets offer analysts a more conservative view of a company’s liquidity or ability to meet its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets because it doesn't include harder to sell inventory and [other current assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/othercurrentassets.asp) that can be difficult to liquidate. By excluding inventory, and other less liquid assets, the quick assets focus on the company’s most liquid assets.\n\nThe quick ratio can also be contrasted against the current ratio, which is equal to a company's total [current assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp), including its inventories, divided by its current liabilities.

The following formula represents the probability of events intersection:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} & P\\\\ \\\\left ( X\\\\bigcap Y \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &X, Y = \\\\text{Two different events that intersect}\\\\\\\\ &P(X \\\\text{ and } Y), P(XY) = \\\\text{The joint probability of X and Y}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​*P* (*X*⋂*Y*)where:*X*,*Y*=Two different events that intersect*P*(*X* and *Y*),*P*(*XY*)=The joint probability of X and Y​﻿\n\n## What Does Joint Probability Tell You?\n\nProbability is a field closely related to [statistics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistics.asp) that deals with the likelihood of an event or phenomena occurring. It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 inclusive, where 0 indicates an impossible chance of occurrence and 1 denotes the certain outcome of an event.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is 1/2 = 0.5. This means that there is an equal chance of drawing a red and drawing a black; since there are 52 cards in a deck, of which 26 are red and 26 are black, there is a 50-50 probability of drawing a red card versus a black card.\n\nJoint probability is a measure of two events happening at the same time, and can only be applied to situations where more than one observation can occur at the same time. For example, from a deck of 52 cards, the joint probability of picking up a card that is both red and 6 is P(6 ∩ red) = 2/52 = 1/26, since a deck of cards has two red sixes—the six of hearts and the six of diamonds. Because the events \"6\" and \"red\" are independent in this example, you can also use the following formula to calculate the joint probability:\n\nP(6 \\\\cap red) = P(6) \\\\times P(red) = 4/52 \\\\times 26/52 = 1/26*P*(6∩*red*)=*P*(6)×*P*(*red*)=4/52×26/52=1/26﻿\n\nThe symbol “∩” in a joint probability is referred to as an intersection. The probability of event X and event Y happening is the same thing as the point where X and Y intersect. Therefore, joint probability is also called the intersection of two or more events. A [Venn diagram](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venn-diagram.asp) is perhaps the best visual tool to explain an intersection:\n\nImage by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019\n\nFrom the Venn above, the point where both circles overlap is the intersection, which has two observations: the six of hearts and the six of diamonds.\n\n## The Difference Between Joint Probability and Conditional Probability\n\nJoint probability should not be confused with [conditional probability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conditional_probability.asp), which is the probability that one event will happen *given that* another action or event happens. The conditional probability formula is as follows:\n\nP(X, given\\~Y) \\\\text{ or } P(X | Y)*P*(*X*,*given* *Y*) or *P*(*X*∣*Y*)﻿\n\nThis is to say that the chance of one event happening is conditional on another event happening. For example, from a deck of cards, the probability that you get a six, given that you drew a red card is P(6│red) = 2/26 = 1/13, since there are two sixes out of 26 red cards.\n\nJoint probability only factors the likelihood of both events occurring. Conditional probability can be used to calculate joint probability, as seen in this formula:\n\nP(X \\\\cap Y) = P(X|Y) \\\\times P(Y)*P*(*X*∩*Y*)=*P*(*X*∣*Y*)×*P*(*Y*)﻿\n\nThe probability that A and B occurs is the probability of X occurring, given that Y occurs multiplied by the probability that Y occurs. Given this formula, the probability of drawing a 6 and a red at the same time will be as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &P(6 \\\\cap red) = P(6|red) \\\\times P(red) = \\\\\\\\ &1/13 \\\\times 26/52 = 1/13 \\\\times 1/2 = 1/26\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​*P*(6∩*red*)=*P*(6∣*red*)×*P*(*red*)=1/13×26/52=1/13×1/2=1/26​﻿\n\nStatisticians and analysts use joint probability as a tool when two or more observable events can occur simultaneously. For instance, joint probability can be used to estimate the likelihood of a drop in the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp) (DJIA) accompanied by a drop in Microsoft’s share price, or the chance that the value of oil rises at the same time the [U.S. dollar weakens](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weak-dollar.asp).\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstpSefI35Nwle8ANrSVDEkGCL60OeivOnf9ASQEz7OtLlxSCwW-iGNrAwZFLngusSkJC9LpY10fQmW1LF3YWpi_ayKJ3X5q0wtxQ744DDR96ofhaHuapMwn9DNsMnZvFaySxIdiaXZ80DSarGhh9eIVaWJ8qJyZiYkOU1oJOrScA2GIKsHtm5JQGGHnSMKMMLMBtXASAwZMZDIwdN8194sB69KDQjUyh7Ei8LYUI1UES5pScbWxjX7bS9i_yr7NJzmhfRgI0eB1x4Zp2SBoxwKeYzMm1uBTuRTFFhxel-VCnq4UnDZnsJRSK301qwy-cCXKXpldRaf9kjx1-synIoiL3PcSlEM6RRVfZKk2u1hJWo0&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAfo4L_uDXIJEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstpSefI35Nwle8ANrSVDEkGCL60OeivOnf9ASQEz7OtLlxSCwW-iGNrAwZFLngusSkJC9LpY10fQmW1LF3YWpi_ayKJ3X5q0wtxQ744DDR96ofhaHuapMwn9DNsMnZvFaySxIdiaXZ80DSarGhh9eIVaWJ8qJyZiYkOU1oJOrScA2GIKsHtm5JQGGHnSMKMMLMBtXASAwZMZDIwdN8194sB69KDQjUyh7Ei8LYUI1UES5pScbWxjX7bS9i_yr7NJzmhfRgI0eB1x4Zp2SBoxwKeYzMm1uBTuRTFFhxel-VCnq4UnDZnsJRSK301qwy-cCXKXpldRaf9kjx1-synIoiL3PcSlEM6RRVfZKk2u1hJWo0&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAfo4L_uDXIJEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "WFo-DsjKfqUZdWONNfn7kEdUMF4h7sIr1bmGkml58Fk", "title": "Quarter on Quarter (QOQ)", "body": "## What Is Quarter on Quarter (QOQ)?\n\nQuarter on quarter (QOQ) is a measuring technique that calculates the change between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter. The term is similar to the [year-over-year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/year-over-year.asp) (YOY) measure, which compares the quarter of one year (such as the first quarter of 2020) to the same quarter of the previous year (the first quarter of 2019). The measure gives investors and analysts an idea of how a company is growing over each quarter.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* QOQ compares a change in performance between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter.\n* QOQ reflects short-term changes in various metrics and can indicate company performance over two quarters.\n* Businesses that have income fluctuations or peak earnings at certain times may need to make seasonal adjustments or use a YOY metric to measure performance.\n\n## Understanding Quarter on Quarter\n\nQOQ allows a business to monitor shorter-term changes and to progress toward goals or benchmarks set for the year. It can provide valuable information as to how a company is performing and allow the company to respond and make process changes if required.\n\nOften, the QOQ measure is used to compare the [earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) between quarters. For example, ABC Company's first-quarter earnings were $1.50 per share, and its second-quarter earnings were $1.75 per share. By calculating the QOQ growth between quarters ($1.75 - $1.50/$1.50), it's clear that the company has grown its earnings by 16.6%, which is a positive indicator for investors.\n\n## Quarter on Quarter in Practice\n\nWhen used in financial or accounting principles, a quarter is a consecutive three-month period within the year. Traditionally, the first quarter (Q1) refers to January, February, and March. Each subsequent three-month period represents Q2, Q3, and Q4.\n\nWhen used as part of a QOQ analysis, a business would compare [financials](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) from Q2 (April, May, June) to Q1 (January, February, March). This comparison varies from YOY where the same quarter is compared from one year to the next. For example, Q1 of 2019 is compared to Q1 of 2018 in a YOY review.\n\nComparing quarters on a year-over-year (YOY) basis can be more effective than on a quarter on quarter (QOQ) basis, as it gives a broader picture of company health and is not impacted by seasonal issues.\n\n## Challenges with QOQ Analysis\n\nThere are circumstances where QOQ analysis may not provide a holistic view of the health of an organization. For example, if an industry experiences [seasonal sales variance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonal-industry.asp), such as landscapers or seasonal sellers, what may appear to be a downward trend may be an industry norm. The same can apply if a business experiences higher earnings during a peak season that may reflect abnormally high growth from one quarter to the next. An organization may choose to adjust the figures seasonally and compensate for regular shifts in business giving a more accurate picture throughout the year. Since YOY analysis involves the examination of the same quarter from one year to the next, it does not typically require a seasonal adjustment to provide valuable data.\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nA company's earnings report from one quarter to the next can affect the market. A disappointing earnings report can cause the stock to plunge as investors try to sell off the stock before the price drops.\n\nIn 2018, Amazon's third-quarter earnings exceeded analysts' estimates, but Amazon's guidance for the fourth quarter fell short of expectations, and the company's stock price plunged in response to the announcement. The last quarter of the year includes the holidays and is typically Amazon's busiest season. Fourth-quarter revenue guidance was significantly below the consensus and caused concern among shareholders. Amazon stock plunged by 10%, although it eventually recovered as investors priced in the news.", "timestamp": 1655169814, "digest": "uAxvMWU1GW8-vtGbZ5AryFum8pkP0kQkwrMyP0bYqaA", "contributor": "0x7f0c19D5539360531fE37Aef7070E746846D0432"}

{"id": "2Hw9NOFi5dUOGIGRllGrk2t_CZ-WRJpv50Aw9J7y2Ik", "title": "Quick Ratio", "body": "## What Is the Quick Ratio?\n\nThe quick ratio is an indicator of a company’s short-term [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) position and measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\nSince it indicates the company’s ability to instantly use its near-cash assets (assets that can be converted quickly to cash) to pay down its current liabilities, it is also called the [acid test ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acidtest.asp). An \"acid test\" is a slang term for a quick test designed to produce instant results.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The quick ratio measures a company's capacity to pay its current liabilities without needing to sell its inventory or obtain additional financing.\n* The quick ratio is considered a more conservative measure than the current ratio, which includes all current assets as coverage for current liabilities.\n* The higher the ratio result, the better a company's liquidity and financial health; the lower the ratio, the more likely the company will struggle with paying debts.\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 2 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n2:02\n\n#### What Is The Quick Ratio?\n\n## Understanding the Quick Ratio\n\nThe quick ratio measures the dollar amount of liquid assets available against the dollar amount of current liabilities of a company. [Liquid assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp) are those [current assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp) that can be quickly converted into cash with minimal impact on the price received in the open market, while [current liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp) are a company's debts or obligations that are due to be paid to creditors within one year.\n\nA result of 1 is considered to be the normal quick ratio. It indicates that the company is fully equipped with exactly enough assets to be instantly liquidated to pay off its current liabilities. A company that has a quick ratio of less than 1 may not be able to fully pay off its current liabilities in the short term, while a company having a quick ratio higher than 1 can instantly get rid of its current liabilities. For instance, a quick ratio of 1.5 indicates that a company has $1.50 of liquid assets available to cover each $1 of its current liabilities.\n\nWhile such numbers-based ratios offer insight into the viability and certain aspects of a business, they may not provide a complete picture of the overall health of the business. It is important to look at other associated measures to assess the true picture of a company's financial health.\n\n## Formula for the Quick Ratio\n\nThe formula to calculate the quick ratio is:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &QR=\\\\frac{CE+MS+AR}{CL}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Or}\\\\\\\\ &QR=\\\\frac{CA-I-PE}{CL}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &QR=\\\\text{Quick ratio}\\\\\\\\ &CE=\\\\text{Cash } \\\\&\\\\text{ equivalents}\\\\\\\\ &MS=\\\\text{Marketable securities}\\\\\\\\ &AR=\\\\text{Accounts receivable}\\\\\\\\ &CL=\\\\text{Current Liabilities}\\\\\\\\ &CA=\\\\text{Current Assets}\\\\\\\\ &I=\\\\text{Inventory}\\\\\\\\ &PE=\\\\text{Prepaid expenses} \\\\end{aligned}​*QR*=*CLCE*+*MS*+*AR*​Or*QR*=*CLCA*−*I*−*PE*​where:*QR*=Quick ratio*CE*=Cash & equivalents*MS*=Marketable securities*AR*=Accounts receivable*CL*=Current Liabilities*CA*=Current Assets*I*=Inventory*PE*=Prepaid expenses​\n\nTo calculate the quick ratio, locate each of the formula components on a company's balance sheet in the current assets and current liabilities sections. Plug the corresponding balance into the equation and perform the calculation.\n\nWhile calculating the quick ratio, double-check the constituents you're using in the formula. The numerator of liquid assets should include the assets that can be easily converted to cash in the short-term (within 90 days or so) without compromising on their price. Inventory is not included in the quick ratio because many companies, in order to sell through their inventory in 90 days or less, would have to apply steep discounts to incentivize customers to buy quickly. [Inventory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp) includes raw materials, components, and finished products.\n\nSimilarly, only accounts receivables that can be collected within about 90 days should be considered. [Accounts receivable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp) refers to the money that is owed to a company by its customers for goods or services already delivered.\n\n## Customer Payment Impact on the Quick Ratio\n\nA business may have a large amount of money as accounts receivable, which may bump up the quick ratio. However, if the payment from the customer is delayed due to unavoidable circumstances, or if the payment has a due date that is a long period out, such as 120 days based on terms of sale, the company may not be able to meet its short-term [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp). This may include essential business expenses and accounts payable that need immediate payment. Despite having a healthy accounts receivable balance, the quick ratio might actually be too low, and the business could be at risk of running out of cash.\n\nOn the other hand, a company could negotiate rapid receipt of payments from its customers and secure longer terms of payment from its suppliers, which would keep liabilities on the books longer. By converting accounts receivable to cash faster, it may have a healthier quick ratio and be fully equipped to pay off its current liabilities.\n\nWhether accounts receivable is a source of quick, ready cash remains a debatable topic, and depends on the credit terms that the company extends to its customers. A company that needs advance payments or allows only 30 days to the customers for payment will be in a better liquidity position than a company that gives 90 days. Additionally, a company’s credit terms with its suppliers also affect its liquidity position. If a company gives its customers 60 days to pay but has 120 days to pay its suppliers, its liquidity position will be healthy as long as its receivables match or exceed its payables.\n\nThe other two components, [cash & cash equivalents](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcashequivalents.asp) and [marketable securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp), are usually free from such time-bound dependencies. However, to maintain precision in the calculation, one should consider only the amount to be actually received in 90 days or less under normal terms. Early liquidation or premature withdrawal of assets like interest-bearing securities may lead to penalties or discounted book value.\n\n## Example of Quick Ratio\n\nPublicly traded companies generally report the quick ratio figure under the “Liquidity/Financial Health” heading in the “Key Ratios” section of their quarterly reports.\n\nBelow is the calculation of the quick ratio based on the figures that appear on the [balance sheets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) of two leading competitors operating in the personal care industrial sector, P&G and J&J, for the [fiscal year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp) ending in 2021 and 2020 respectively.12\n\n   *(in $millions)*  **Procter & Gamble**  **Johnson & Johnson**  Quick Assets   (A)  $15,013  $38,761  Current Liabilities   (B)  $33,132  $42,439  **Quick Ratio**   **(A/B)**  **0.45**  **0.91**\n\nWith a quick ratio of 0.91, Johnson & Johnson appears to be in a decent position to cover its current liabilities, though its liquid assets aren't quite able to meet each dollar of short-term obligations.1 Procter & Gamble, on the other hand, may not be able to pay off its current obligations using only quick assets as its quick ratio is well below 1, at 0.45.2\n\n## Quick Ratio vs. Current Ratio\n\nThe quick ratio is more conservative than the [current ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp) because it excludes inventory and other current assets, which are generally more difficult to turn into cash. The quick ratio considers only assets that can be converted to cash in a short period of time. The current ratio, on the other hand, considers inventory and prepaid expense assets. In most companies, inventory takes time to liquidate, although a few rare companies can turn their inventory fast enough to consider it a quick asset. Prepaid expenses, though an asset, cannot be used to pay for current liabilities, so they're omitted from the quick ratio.\n\n## Why Is it Called the \"Quick\" Ratio?\n\nThe quick ratio looks at only the most liquid assets that a company has available to service short-term debts and obligations. Liquid assets are those that can quickly and easily be converted into cash in order to pay those bills.\n\n## What Assets Are Considered the Most \"Quick\"?\n\nThe quickest or most liquid assets available to a company are cash and cash equivalents (such as money market investments), followed by marketable securities that can be sold in the market at a moment's notice through the firm's broker. Accounts receivable are also included, as these are the payments that are owed in the short run to the company from goods sold or services rendered that are due.\n\n## How Do the Quick and Current Ratios Differ?\n\nThe quick ratio only looks at the most liquid assets on a firm's balance sheet, and so gives the most immediate picture of liquidity available if needed in a pinch, making it the most conservative measure of liquidity. The current ratio also includes less liquid assets such as inventories and other current assets such as prepaid expenses.\n\n## What Happens if the Quick Ratio Indicates a Firm is Not Liquid?\n\nIn this case, a [liquidity crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity-crisis.asp) can arise even at healthy companies—if circumstances arise that make it difficult to meet short-term obligations such as repaying their loans and paying their employees or suppliers. One example of a far-reaching liquidity crisis from recent history is the global credit crunch of 2007-08, where many companies found themselves unable to secure short-term financing to pay their immediate obligations.

{"id": "UmgB-UBlUiHjRwhb9cQIdy4NaMtiI6EMJBfTCpdCiPI", "title": "Joint-Stock Company", "body": "## What Is a Joint-Stock Company?\n\nThe joint-stock company is a predecessor to the modern corporation. A joint-stock company is a business owned by its investors, with each investor owning a share based on the amount of stock purchased.\n\nJoint-stock companies are created in order to finance endeavors that are too expensive for an individual or even a government to fund. The owners of a joint-stock company expect to share in its profits.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A joint-stock company is a business owned collectively by its shareholders, who can buy or sell shares to one another.\n* Joint-stock companies are the ancestors of the modern corporation, although there are legal differences.\n* Historically, a joint-stock company was not incorporated and thus its shareholders could bear unlimited liability for debts owed by the company.\n* In the U.S., the process of incorporation limits shareholder liability to the face value of their shares.1\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 5 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:05\n\n#### Joint-Stock Company\n\n## Understanding Joint-Stock Companies\n\nUnless the company is incorporated, the shareholders of a joint-stock company have unlimited liability for company debts. The legal process of incorporation, in the U.S., reduces that liability to the face value of stock owned by the shareholder.1 In Great Britain, the term \"limited\" has a similar meaning.2\n\nThe shares of a joint-stock company are transferable. If the joint-stock company is public, its shares are traded on registered stock exchanges. Shares of private joint-stock company stock are transferable between parties, but the transfer process is often limited by agreement, to family members, for example.1\n\nHistorically, investors in joint-stock companies could have [unlimited liability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unlimited-liability.asp), meaning that a shareholder's personal property could be seized to pay off debts in the event of a company collapse.3\n\nHistorically, investors in joint-stock companies could have unlimited liability, meaning that a shareholder's personal property could be seized to pay off company debts.3\n\n## Joint-Stock Company vs. Public Company\n\nThe term joint-stock company is virtually synonymous with a corporation, public company, or just plain company, except for a historical association with unlimited liability. That is, a modern corporation is a joint-stock company that has been incorporated in order to limit shareholder liability.\n\nEach country has its own laws regarding a joint-stock company. These generally include a process to limit liability.\n\n## A Short History of Joint-Stock Companies\n\nThere are records of joint-stock companies being formed in Europe as early as the 13th century. However, they appear to have multiplied beginning in the 16th century, when adventurous investors began speculating about opportunities to be found in the New World.4\n\nEuropean exploration of the Americas was largely financed by joint-stock companies. Governments were eager for new territory but were reluctant to take on the enormous costs and risks associated with these ventures.4\n\nThat led entrepreneurs to devise a [business plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-plan.asp). They would sell shares in their ventures to many investors in order to raise money to fund voyages to the New World. The potential for resources to be exploited and trade to be developed was the attraction for many investors. Others wanted to literally stake a claim in the New World and establish new communities that would be free of religious persecution.4\n\nIn American history, the Virginia Company of London is one of the earliest and most famous joint-stock companies. In 1606, King James I signed a royal charter permitting the company exclusive rights to establish a colony in what is now Virginia. The Virginia Company's business plan was ambitious, ranging from exploiting the region's gold resources (there weren't any) to finding a navigable route to China (they didn't).4\n\nAfter many hardships, the company successfully established the Jamestown colony in Virginia and began to grow and export tobacco. However, in 1624, an English court ordered the company to dissolve and converted Virginia into a royal colony. The investors in the Virginia Company never saw a profit.4\n\n## Why Were Joint Stock Companies Important in U.S. History?\n\nJoint-stock companies played a major role in funding the settlement of the original colonies. These companies could raise money from many investors, without exposing any investor to excessive risk. This allowed the companies to raise enough resources to launch successful settlements in the new world. One famous example was the Virginia Company of London, which funded the settlement at Jamestown.5\n\n## What Was the Advantage of Joint Stock Companies?\n\nJoint-stock companies can raise a large amount of capital by issuing shares, rather than relying on a single investor. This made them a practical investment vehicle for colonial ventures that were prohibitively expensive for any single financier. Moreover, the introduction of tradeable shares added an element of liquidity, since investors could realize gains without waiting for the venture to conclude.\n\n## What Was the Most Famous Joint-Stock company?\n\nPerhaps the most famous joint-stock company was the British East India Company, which was formed to trade with India and Asia. Over the course of its 250-year history, the EIC effectively controlled the colonization and exploitation of India and other overseas territories.6\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nJoint-stock companies are collectively owned by shareholders. Some existed as early as the 13th century. While, historically, they left shareholders open to unlimited liability, incorporation law has limited liability for shareholders. In the U.S., it was limited to the face value of their shares.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "6LuReJG3zjpESzvLYPu2YPqojnwCFhX2bM0FQBYnah4", "title": "Quota", "body": "## What Is a Quota?\n\nA quota is a government-imposed trade restriction that limits the number or monetary value of goods that a country can import or export during a particular period. Countries use quotas in international trade to help regulate the [volume of trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volumeoftrade.asp) between them and other countries. Countries sometimes impose quotas on specific products to reduce [imports](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import.asp) and increase domestic production. In theory, quotas boost domestic production by restricting foreign competition.\n\nGovernment programs that implement quotas are often referred to as [protectionism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp) policies. Additionally, governments can enact these policies if they have concerns over the quality or safety of products arriving from other countries.\n\nIn business, a quota can refer to a sales target that a company wants a salesperson or sales team to achieve for a specific period. Sales quotas are often monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Management can also set sales quotas by region or business unit. The most common type of sales quota is based on [revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Countries use quotas in international trade to help regulate the volume of trade between them and other countries.\n* Within the United States, there are three forms of quotas: absolute, tariff-rate, and tariff-preference level.\n* Tariffs are taxes one country imposes on the goods and services imported from another country.\n* Because tariffs increase the cost of imported goods and services, they make them less attractive to domestic consumers.\n* Highly restrictive quotas coupled with high tariffs can lead to trade disputes and other problems between nations.\n\n \n\n#### Quota\n\n## How a Quota Works\n\nQuotas are different from [tariffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp) or customs, which place taxes on imports or exports. Governments impose both quotas and tariffs as protective measures to try to control trade between countries, but there are distinct differences between them.\n\nQuotas focus on limiting the quantities (or, in some cases, cumulative value) of a particular good that a country imports or [exports](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp) for a specific period, whereas tariffs impose specific fees on those goods. Governments design tariffs (also known as customs duties) to raise the overall cost to the producer or supplier seeking to sell products within a country. Tariffs provide a country with extra revenue and they offer protection to domestic producers by causing imported items to become more expensive.\n\nQuotas are a type of [nontariff barrier](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nontariff-barrier.asp) governments enact to restrict trade. Other kinds of trade barriers include [embargoes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embargo.asp), levies, and sanctions.\n\nQuotas are more effective in restricting trade than tariffs, especially if domestic demand for something is not price-sensitive. Quotas may also be more disruptive to [international trade](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-international-trade/) than tariffs. Applied selectively to various countries, they can be utilized as a coercive economic weapon.\n\n## Import Quota Regulatory Agencies\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, a federal law-enforcement agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, oversees the regulation of international trade, collecting customs, and enforcing U.S. trade regulations. Within the United States, the three forms of quotas are absolute, tariff-rate, and tariff-preference level:1﻿\n\n1. An absolute quota provides a definitive restriction on the quantity of a particular good that may be imported into the United States, although this level of restriction is not always in use. Under an absolute quota, once the quantity permitted by the quota is filled, merchandise subject to the quota must be held in a bonded warehouse or entered into a foreign trade zone until the opening of the next quota period.\n2. Tariff-rate quotas allow a country to import a certain quantity of a particular good at a reduced [duty](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duty.asp) rate. Once the tariff-rate quota is met, all subsequently imported goods are charged at a higher rate.\n3.

Livermore’s Maxwell Murialdo and Jonathan L. Belof say their innovation would make it possible to transmit electricity without physical wires or a grid and create a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to a physical asset – electricity – that is dependent on its utility for is value. \n\nAccording to the scientists, the E-Stablecoin would be minted through the input of one kilowatt-hour of electricity, plus a fee. The stablecoin could then be used for transactions the same way as any stablecoin, or the energy could be extracted by burning it, also for a fee. The entire process would be controlled by smart contracts with a decentralized data storage cloud. No trusted centralized authority would be needed to maintain or disburse the asset.\n\n***Related: [Crypto crash wreaking havoc on DeFi protocols, CEXs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-crash-wreaking-havoc-on-defi-protocols-cexs)***\n\nThis would be a first for a hard-pegged stablecoin, being directly exchangeable for a specified quantity of a physical asset, the scientists said. They suggested that [electricity has a highly stable price and demand](https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-how-blockchains-are-helping-to-advance-the-global-energy-grid), and the electricity used in minting E-Stablecoins would be easily sustainable. Investors would be able to mint E-Stablecoins in regions where electricity prices are low and burn the tokens where electricity is more expensive.\n\nMurialdo and Belof described their work as a proof of concept and made extensive use of advanced mathematics for their reasoning. To make a working E-Stablecoin, “further advances that increase the speed, transfer entropy, and scalability of information engines will likely be required,” according to the scientists.\n\nImproved cloud storage, or an alternative to it, would also be needed. In the meantime, their research has theoretical implications for the way in which cryptos derive their value, the authors said.

With 16 local organizations, located in 8 countries and over 50 different projects incubated through the network. A social network for in real life climate action movement has been created. With hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of volunteer labor contributed so far. The projects collaborating together exemplify an intersection of climate, economy and social justice. Out of the 30,0000 people carrying out regenerative actions on the ground, most are focused on regional food security and local food movement.**\n\n![Map Of Bloom Network Local Orgs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8yVvADoiFgdaBZ3Uprv4_.png?height=654&width=1600)\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, [Muda Outras Economias](http://mudaoutraseconomias.com/) are doing socio cultural environmental regeneration\n\n* Fully functioning regional tokenomics\n* Community Supported Arts and Agriculture (CSAA).\n* Beach cleanups\n* Organic food production\n* Connecting people in favelas to this network\n* Supporting black owned businesses\n* Restorative justice.\n\nIn Costa Rica the Diamante Bridge Collective\n\n* Involvement of Giveth\n* Regional economy focused on land and watershed care\n* Very Holistic\n* Bamboo Construction\n* Hemp\n* Healing Retreats\n* Grey Water Filtration\n* Education\n* Care for Water\n\nIn Long Beach, California- Long Beach Fresh\n\n* 10,000 person local food movement\n* Cultural Regeneration\n* Empowering Diversity\n* Local food movement\n\nIn Kampala, Uganda-  [Broadfield Enterprises Uganda – Permaculture Group](http://www.broadfieldpermaculture.org/Aboutus.html)\n\n* Commercially viable permaculture agroforestry (3 export crops intercropped with 500 indigenous species)\n* Women lead coops\n* Regenerating soil\n* Nature Based Disaster Risk Reduction (flooding)\n* Microclimate regeneration\n\n> **However, “Our project very likely would have died if we hadn't had a very successful Gitcoin grant round 12” said Magenta Ceiba.**\n\nThe system level change that Bloom Network is creating, was not able to find sufficient financial resources outside of web3 to enable this organization to survive. Potential funding sources were confused when they started talking about international organizational structures functioning in a level field where anything was possible. However, in web3 DAOs are common and people regularly work with an international community to push ideas forward. Thanks to Gitcoin and Giveth, Bloom Network is growing and in a few months time will be in full blossom after over a decade of work.\n\nCome July 2nd they will have their first legal entity for supporting the DAO structure, a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association (LCA) (thanks to an [all female legal team](https://jrwiener.com/)). Membership fees collected go 80% to local Bloom Network Orgs and 20% to Bloom International. Once the LCA is established Bloom Network will be able to issue the $FLO or Flower token.\n\n$FLO token basic design\n\n* Tokens distributed when Regenerative Actions Logged\n* COOP Patronage Reward Tokens\n* Governance Power\n* Further Decentralizing the Organization\n* Connecting the International Regenerative Network Together\n\nThese tokens will allow all of the people that have been and will be part of Bloom Network to inter cooperate across many different countries, which would be very clunky if using a fiat finance system and would have intermediary fees (not to mention [31% of adults are unbanked](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf)). The tokens embrace the values of Bloom Network and are able to connect people together through that. Tokens can be put up as bounty rewards to encourage a decentralized community to work together on internationally relevant projects and support each other. These tokens will be one of the cheapest and fastest ways to get funding channeled to grassroots projects on the ground. Bloom Network also realizes they are part of a larger ReFi movement and have already started conversations with Orgo and other ReFi organizations to see how they can allow their members to benefit from the shared infrastructure for regeneration this movement is building.\n\nOn the other side of the tech stack, with over a decade working on Bloom Network, a lot of knowledge has been accumulated and needs to be channeled for increased scalability and replicability. Bloom Network has been working on a [multi user blogging platform](https://bloomnetwork.org/preview-of-bloom-networks-forthcoming-platform/) that is completely focused on regenerative actions. This platform will feature templates people anywhere can use to start a community garden or a crop swap, or know what to do year one on the land with forest repair or how to do regenerative agriculture in different areas. These templates will allow people to harness what it has taken Bloom Network members years to learn and run with it. Allowing people to carry our regenerative climate action a lot faster. Along with that, it will help more people find and participate in regenerative action projects and grassroots projects. This platform is somewhere between three weeks to a couple months out depending on funding resources.\n\nThe Bloom Network is GROWING and it is all possible thanks to people connecting with one another and the local community around them. If you’d like to be part of the movement contact us (community(at)bloomnetwork.org), find a [Bloom near you](https://bloomnetwork.org/find-a-bloom/), learn from [templates available](https://bloomnetwork.org/wiki/), and [any contribution helps](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1595/bloom-network) (at the time of writing a donation could get anywhere from $16-$88 in matching funding).\n\n[Link to Our Chat](https://twitter.com/Avano_io/status/1536468880771944450?s=20&t=aV_CLSQvkW77bmeFqvy_xg)", "timestamp": 1655170365, "digest": "At0XWFeBa5soryE1lUqbWQxJf4TZ9sLsn3Pw5c1ftwA", "contributor": "0x5A6C1AFa7d14FD608af17d7e58e8DB52DF5d66Ea"}

{"id": "IL5kMPTwVKQqanTw5DNVaO1MmP9ZBZ_Gs6lX-BL2Vro", "title": "Quintiles", "body": "## What are Quintiles?\n\nA quintile is a statistical value of a data set that represents 20% of a given population, so the first quintile represents the lowest fifth of the data (1% to 20%); the second quintile represents the second fifth (21% to 40%) and so on.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020\n\nQuintiles are used to create cut-off points for a given population; a government-sponsored socio-economic study may use quintiles to determine the maximum wealth a family could possess in order to belong to the lowest quintile of society. This cut-off point can then be used as a prerequisite for a family to receive a special government [subsidy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp) aimed to help society's less fortunate.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Quintiles are representative of 20% of a given population. Therefore, the first quintile represents the lowest fifth of data and final quintile represents the final or last fifth of a data.\n* They are generally used for large data sets and are often invoked by politicians and economists to discuss economic and social justice concepts.\n* Depending on the size of the population, alternatives to quintiles include quartiles and tertiles.\n\n## Understanding Quintiles\n\nA quintile is a type of quantile, which is defined as equal-sized segments of a population. One of the most common metrics in statistical analysis, the median, is actually just the result of dividing a population into two quantiles. A quintile is one of five values that divide a range of data into five equal parts, each being 1/5th (20 percent) of the range. A population split into three equal parts is divided into tertiles, while one split into fourths is divided into [quartiles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quartile.asp). The larger the data set, the easier it is to divide into greater quantiles. Economists often use quintiles to analyze very large data sets, such as the population of the United States.\n\nFor example, if we were to look at all of the closing prices for a specific stock for every day in the last year, the top 20% of those prices would represent the upper quintile of the data. The bottom 20% of those prices would represent the lower quintile of the data. There would be three quintiles in between the upper and lower quintiles. While the average of all the stock prices typically falls between the second and fourth quintiles, which is the middle point of the data, outliers on either the high end or the low end of the data may increase or decrease the average value. As a result, it is worth considering the distribution of the data points—and accounting for any significant outliers—when trying to understand the data and the average values.\n\n## Common Uses of Quintiles\n\nPoliticians invoke quintiles to illustrate the need for policy changes. For example, a politician who champions economic justice can divide the population into quintiles to illustrate how the top 20% of income earners controls what is, in his opinion, an unfairly large share of the wealth. On the other end of the spectrum, a politician calling for an end to progressive taxation might use quintiles to make the argument that the top 20% shoulder too large a share of the tax burden.\n\nIn \"The Bell Curve,\" a controversial 1994 book on intelligence quotient (IQ), the authors use quintiles throughout the text to illustrate their research, showing that IQ is heavily correlated with positive outcomes in life.\n\n## Alternatives to Quintiles\n\nFor certain populations, the use of other methods to examine how the data is distributed makes more sense than using quintiles. For smaller data sets, the use of quartiles or tertiles helps prevent the data from being spread too thin. Comparing the mean, or average, of a data set to its [median](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp), or the cutoff point where the data is divided into two quantiles, reveals if the data is evenly distributed or if it is skewed toward the top or bottom.

{"id": "K1_HCkOsn2Nisj6EWCb0WlsVHr55i03aCp9TRvXYRwA", "title": "The Jones Act", "body": "## What Is the Jones Act?\n\nThe Jones Act is a federal law that regulates [maritime](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/123115/top-6-companies-crude-tanker-business.asp) commerce in the United States. The Jones Act requires goods shipped between U.S. ports to be transported on ships that are built, owned, and operated by United States citizens or permanent residents. The Jones Act is Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, which provided for the maintenance of the American merchant marine.1﻿﻿2﻿\n\n## Understanding the Jones Act\n\nConsidered protectionist legislation, the Jones Act focuses on issues related to maritime commerce, including cabotage, which is the transport of people or goods between ports in the same country. It also provides sailors with additional rights, including the ability to seek damages from the crew, captain, or ship owner in the case of injury.3﻿ Perhaps its most lasting effect is its requirement that goods shipped between [U.S. ports](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052715/west-coast-vs-east-coast-economy.asp) be transported on ships built, owned, and operated by United States citizens or permanent residents.2﻿\n\nThe Jones Act increases the cost of shipping to Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other non-continental U.S. lands that rely on imports by restricting the number of vessels that can legally deliver goods. The supply of American-built, -owned, and -operated vessels is relatively small compared to the global supply of ships, while the demand for basic goods tends to remain constant or grow. This creates a scenario in which shipping companies can charge higher rates because of a lack of competition, with the increased [costs passed on to consumers](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/012005.asp). This may lead to consumers taking on more debt in order to finance purchases, which can have a negative effect on government finances.\n\nThe Jones Act is a piece of protectionist legislation that considerably increases the costs of shipping goods between two U.S. ports.\n\n## History of the Jones Act\n\nThe Jones Act was enacted by the United States Congress in order to stimulate the shipping industry in the wake of the World War I. The requirement about shipping cargo between American ports only on American ships benefited the constituents of Wesley Jones, the U.S. Senator from the state of Washington who introduced the act. Washington had a large shipping industry, and the act was designed to give the state a monopoly on shipping to Alaska. While the act benefited Jones’ constituents, it increased the shipping costs of other states and U.S. territories.4﻿\n\nOn several occasions, the U.S. government has granted temporary waivers on Jones Act requirements. This is typically done in the wake of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, in order to increase the number of ships that can legally supply goods to an affected area.4﻿\n\n## Criticism of the Jones Act\n\nThe act has been criticized for restricting who can conduct trade with Puerto Rico, and it has been cited as a factor leading to the island’s economic and budgetary troubles. A study released by the [New York Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082415/what-are-federal-reserve-chairmans-responsibilities.asp) in 2012 found that the cost of transporting a shipping container to Puerto Rico from the mainland was twice as high as shipping the same container from a foreign port.5﻿\n\nA 2019 report prepared by the New York City-based economic consulting firm John Dunham and Associates found that for Puerto Rico the \"the differentials between US- and foreign-flagged carriers range from about 41.0 percent to as high as 62.0 percent for bulk cargo and between 29 percent and 89 percent for containerized freight.” It calculated the additional costs caused by the act for the island’s economy to be nearly $1.2 billion, which comes to roughly $374 per resident.6﻿\n\nOpponents of the act want it repealed, hoping that this will result in decreased shipping costs, lower prices, and less strain on government budgets. Proponents of the act include states with owners of navy yards, defense firms, and shipping industries, as well as the longshoremen and other personnel who work in ports. Scrapping the law will likely reduce the number of U.S. maritime jobs while lowering shipping costs.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "kS3NEaQAoUOqAmox53_KmptTWucy1mk5eUVhMP-LKiI", "title": "Who Is Joseph Schumpeter?", "body": "### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Joseph Alois Schumpeter is best known for his 1942 book *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy*, the theory of creative destruction, and for offering the first German and English references to methodological individualism in economics.\n* Schumpeter served as minister of finance in the Austrian government, the president of a private bank, and a professor, before being forced to emigrate, due to the rise of the Nazi Party.\n* The economist coined the term \"creative destruction\" to describe how the old is being constantly replaced by the new.\n* Schumpeter also introduced the concept of entrepreneurship.\n* Schumpeter’s work was initially overshadowed by the contrasting theories of his contemporary, John Maynard Keynes, but it now has become the centerpiece for modern thinking on how economies evolve.\n\nInvestopedia / Alison Czinkota\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nSchumpeter was born in Moravia (now the Czech Republic) in 1883, to German parents. He studied economics from the progenitors of the [Austrian school tradition](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/austrian-school-of-economics.asp), including Friedrich von Wieser and Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk. Schumpeter served as minister of finance in the Austrian government, the president of a private bank, and a university professor. From 1925 to 1932, Schumpeter held a chair at the University of Bonn.1\n\nUncomfortable at the rise of the Nazi Party, he moved to the United States to teach at Harvard in 1932. Fifteen years later, in 1947, he became the first immigrant to be elected president of the American Economic Association.1\n\nBy the early 20th century, economic science in the United States and Great Britain had developed alongside static and mathematically oriented [general equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-equilibrium-theory.asp) models. Schumpeter’s work differed at times, typifying the continental European approach—more nuanced and less hypothetical—although some of his theories were drawn from [Walrasian](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/walras-law.asp) general equilibrium as well.\n\n## Notable Accomplishments and Theories\n\nSchumpeter made many contributions to economic science and political theory, but he is best known for his 1942 book *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy*, which outlines the theory of dynamic [economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp) known as [creative destruction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creativedestruction.asp).2 He is also credited with the first German and English references to methodological individualism in economics.\n\n### Creative Destruction\n\nSchumpeter's most enduring legacy came from a six-page chapter in *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy* entitled “The Process of Creative Destruction.”2\n\nIn this chapter, Schumpeter offered a new, unique insight into how economies grow, sharply deviating from the traditional economic dictums of his day, which held that markets passively tend toward [equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp) until [profit margins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp) are wiped out. Instead, Schumpeter argued, economic progress is not gradual and peaceful but rather disjointed, abrupt, and sometimes unpleasant. The economist used the term \"creative destruction\" to describe the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for new technologies, new kinds of products, new methods of production, and new means of distribution.\n\nExisting companies must quickly adapt to a new environment (or fail). If it sounds somewhat Darwinian—it is, Schumpeter intimated: a \"process of industrial mutation—if I may use that biological term—that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one,\" as he wrote. \"This \n process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism.”\n\n### Entrepreneurship\n\nIn many respects, Schumpeter saw capitalism as a sort of ongoing revolution that disrupts the current social and economic hierarchy. And within this system, the [entrepreneur](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp) becomes the revolutionary, upsetting the established order to create dynamic change.\n\nSchumpeter is believed to be the first scholar to introduce the world to the concept—or at least, the economic significance of—entrepreneurship. He came up with the German word *Unternehmergeist,* meaning entrepreneur-spirit, adding that these individuals controlled the economy because they are responsible for delivering innovation and technological change.\n\nEntrepreneurs are often the guiding force behind creative destruction because they advance the new products, technology, and/or production methods that provide an impulse for change. Entrepreneurial innovation and experimentation constantly destroy the status quo and introduce new equilibria, making possible higher [standards of living](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp).\n\n### Business Cycles\n\nThese theories tie in with Schumpeter’s belief in the presence of [business cycles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp).\n\nIn Schumpeter's analysis, the history of capitalism has been punctuated by long and short waves. A long wave is prompted by a new set of technologies and industries coming into existence. According to this theory, major advances in innovation can be predicted to occur every 50 or 100 years.\n\n\"Barring very few cases in which difficulties arise, it is possible to count off, historically as well as statistically, six Juglars \\[8-10-year business cycles\\] to a Kondratieff \\[50-60 years\\] and three Kitchins \\[40 months\\] to a Juglar—not as an average but in every individual case,” wrote Schumpeter in his book *The Theory of Economic Development*, published in 1911.\n\nWhenever an entrepreneur disrupts an existing industry, it is likely that existing workers, businesses, or even entire sectors can be temporarily thrown into loss, he said. These cycles are tolerated, he explained, because it allows resources to be freed up for other, more productive uses.\n\n## Example of Schumpetarian Theory\n\nThe internet is one of the best examples of creative destruction, the term that Schumpeter coined to describe the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for new technologies, new kinds of products, new methods of production, and new means of distribution. Existing companies must quickly adapt to a new environment (or fail).\n\nThe advent of the Internet rendered many products, methods of production, and means of distribution obsolete. It also caused a drastic curtailing of many jobs, including the roles of bank tellers, secretaries, travel agents, and retail store employees. With the rise of mobile internet technology, publishers of printed material—everything from magazines to maps—also suffered.\n\nThe Internet, in addition to other innovations in the field of information technology—the microprocessor, the laser, fiber optics, and satellite technologies—have all fundamentally altered the way that business is conducted.\n\n## Joseph Schumpeter vs. John Maynard Keynes\n\nOver his many years in public life, Schumpeter developed informal rivalries with the other great economic thinkers of the west, including [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp), Irving Fisher, [Ludwig von Mises](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ludwig-von-mises.asp), and [Friedrich Hayek](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/friedrich-hayek.asp). His work initially was overshadowed by some of these contemporaries', especially Keynes. Although they were born just a few months apart, the pair had radically different views.\n\n### \n\n*In his early career, Schumpeter derided the use of statistical aggregates in economic theory—likely a shot at Keynes—in favor of focusing on individual choice and action.*\n\nKeynes viewed the economy as healthy when in static equilibrium. Schumpeter rejected this theory, claiming that equilibrium is not healthy and that innovation is the driver of the economy. Both had contrasting views on government intervention, too. Keynes believed that a permanent equilibrium of prosperity could be achieved by central bank [monetary policies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp). Schumpeter argued that government intervention increased [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp), destroying the economy.\n\nThe internet is one of the best examples of creative destruction, the term that Schumpeter coined to describe the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for new technologies, new kinds of products, new methods of production, and new means of distribution. Existing companies must quickly adapt to a new environment (or fail).\n\nThe advent of the Internet rendered many products, methods of production, and means of distribution obsolete. It also caused a drastic curtailing of many jobs, including the roles of bank tellers, secretaries, travel agents, and retail store employees. With the rise of mobile internet technology, publishers of printed material—everything from magazines to maps—also suffered.\n\nThe Internet, in addition to other innovations in the field of information technology—the microprocessor, the laser, fiber optics, and satellite technologies—have all fundamentally altered the way that business is conducted.\n\n## What Is Joseph Schumpeter’s History of Economic Analysis?\n\nAt the time of his death, in 1950, Schumpeter was working on a new book, *History of Economic Analysis.* In the book, Schumpeter attempts a complete history of the field of economics, from ancient Greece to the present day (the end of World War II). Not just limited to economics, the book also traced the history of political and philosophical ideas and served as a record of significant events.\n\nAlthough never fully completed, *History of Economic Analysis* has gained recognition as an important work, due to its broad scope and original examination of significant historical events. Some notable topics it addresses include the techniques of economic analysis, contemporaneous developments in other sciences, and the sociology of economics.\n\n## What Did Joseph Schumpeter Believe Would Destroy Capitalism?\n\nSchumpeter believed that capitalism would ultimately be destroyed by its success. He hypothesized that the economic system would eventually create a large intellectual class that survived by attacking the system of private property and freedom that was necessary for sustaining its own existence. Although Schumpeter predicted the demise of capitalism, he was an ardent supporter of it.\n\n## What Is Joseph Schumpeter’s Innovation Theory of Profit?\n\nSchumpeter believed that the was to introduce successful, well, innovations. The innovation theory of profit claims that the main function of an entrepreneur is to introduce, well, innovations—which Schumpeter defined as any new policy that reduces the overall cost of production or increases the demand for products. Any profit an entrepreneur receives from these efforts is a form of reward for their performance. Creating innovations was the first step on the path to success and economic profits for entrepreneurs.3\n\n## What Is Schumpeterian Growth?\n\nSchumpeterian growth is economic growth that is driven by innovation and governed by the process of creative destruction. Formal economic models have been created that operationalize Schumpeter’s notion of creative destruction. These models of growth help economists understand the role of competition, firm dynamics, and cross-firm and cross-sector reallocation.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nJoseph Schumpeter’s work initially received little acclaim, due in part to the great popularity of his contemporary, John Maynard Keynes. That changed over time and he is now viewed as one of the greatest economists of modern times. He introduced the concept of the entrepreneur and the influence of entrepreneurship on economic systems. His theory of creative destruction has become the centerpiece for modern thinking on how economies evolve—especially capitalist ones.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvvDm8lNoKd1_j36CcpWAjn3mAu-_ntgdIjtmI4rPO6rRRIWxfXJt1U2feQgICyIrmYuCoUS-OEkA3OFmFFSQ-VELuT8W2iYN2s7bPXa3HVE8274Tbf5ivELBZE3nkzkcEPJjMmpyZEnYb3sb4Qf6mO9mAvfKiicTm_jwnssZvCO9HMejbhMz4WF-QB0dVKRKnW1tsQ0I68Pre-_5eLLGcRQuvtd-nCVaFw37GFmOxHeQ5HsZ3IwuOtRbz5BMByyI6Dr3lxPXbjjDs9u6VTvLVsSW7x1DTIft4zzukwELu0ulbQSKU0JC6xKZFstbgeB0Djc7n_JL3hbm1gI7jjbeYaKg&sig=Cg0ArKJSzObxFQfoU67eEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

Livermore’s Maxwell Murialdo and Jonathan L. Belof say their innovation would make it possible to transmit electricity without physical wires or a grid and create a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to a physical asset – electricity – that is dependent on its utility for is value. \n\nAccording to the scientists, the E-Stablecoin would be minted through the input of one kilowatt-hour of electricity, plus a fee. The stablecoin could then be used for transactions the same way as any stablecoin, or the energy could be extracted by burning it, also for a fee. The entire process would be controlled by smart contracts with a decentralized data storage cloud. No trusted centralized authority would be needed to maintain or disburse the asset.\n\n***Related: [Crypto crash wreaking havoc on DeFi protocols, CEXs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-crash-wreaking-havoc-on-defi-protocols-cexs)***\n\nThis would be a first for a hard-pegged stablecoin, being directly exchangeable for a specified quantity of a physical asset, the scientists said.

To make a working E-Stablecoin, “further advances that increase the speed, transfer entropy, and scalability of information engines will likely be required,” according to the scientists.\n\nImproved cloud storage, or an alternative to it, would also be needed.

{"id": "1ysSEkbSu2TeLSadYrt1z66JRCft5wyE9T2-O-zD6Mo", "title": "Per Capita GDP", "body": "## What Is Per Capita GDP?\n\nPer capita [gross domestic product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) (GDP) is a financial metric that breaks down a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a nation by its population.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) measures a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population.\n* Per capita GDP is a global measure for gauging the prosperity of nations and is used by economists, along with GDP, to analyze the prosperity of a country based on its economic growth.\n* Small, rich countries and more developed industrial countries tend to have the highest per capita GDP.\n\n## Understanding Per Capita GDP\n\nPer capita GDP is a global measure for gauging the prosperity of nations and is used by economists to analyze the prosperity of a country based on its economic growth.\n\nThere are a few ways to analyze a country’s wealth and prosperity. Per capita GDP is the most universal because its components are regularly tracked on a global scale, providing for ease of calculation and usage. Income per capita is another measure for global prosperity analysis, though it is less broadly used.\n\nAt its most basic interpretation, per capita GDP shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each individual citizen. Alternatively, this translates to a measure of national wealth since GDP market value per person also readily serves as a prosperity measure.\n\n## Gross Domestic Product (GDP) vs. Per Capita GDP\n\nGDP itself is the primary measure of a country's economic productivity. A country's GDP shows the market value of goods and services it produces. In the United States, the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bea.asp) reports GDP every quarter.1 Economists watch this quarterly report closely for the quarter over quarter and annual growth figures that can assist them in analyzing the overall health of the economy. Legislators use GDP when making [fiscal policy](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-fiscal-policy/) decisions. GDP can also influence central bankers when they are deciding on the course of future [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp).\n\n### $59,692\n\n*Real GDP per capita for the Q4 2021—a 1.6% increase from the previous quarter and 5.2% increase from the previous year.2 \n *\n\nPer capita GDP is often analyzed alongside GDP. Economists use this metric for insight on both their own country's domestic productivity as well as the productivity of other countries. Per capita GDP considers both a country's GDP and its population. Therefore, it can be important to understand how each factor contributes to the overall result and how each factor is affecting per capita GDP growth.\n\n## Applications of Per Capita GDP\n\nGovernments can use per capita GDP to understand how the economy is growing with its population. GDP per capita analysis on a national level can provide insights into a country’s domestic population influence. Overall, it is important to look at each variable’s contribution to understand how an economy is growing or contracting in terms of its people. There can be several numerical relationships that affect per capita GDP.\n\nIf a country’s per capita GDP is growing with a stable population level it can potentially be the result of technological progressions that are producing more with the same population level. Some countries may have high per capita GDP but a small population which usually means they have built up a self-sufficient economy based on an abundance of special resources.\n\nA nation may have consistent [economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/genuine-progress-indicator-gpi.asp) but if its population is growing faster than its GDP, per capita GDP growth will be negative. This is not a problem for most [established economies](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/), as even a tepid pace of economic growth can still outpace their population growth rates. However, countries with low levels of per capita GDP to begin with—including many nations in Africa—can have rapidly increasing populations with little GDP growth, resulting in a steady erosion of living standards.\n\nGlobal analysis of per capita GDP helps provide comparable insight on economic prosperity and economic developments across the globe. Both GDP and population are factors in the per capita equation. This means countries with the highest GDP may or may not have the highest per capita GDP. Countries may also see a significant increase in per capita GDP as they become more advanced through technological progressions. Technology can be a revolutionary factor that helps countries increase per capita rankings with a stable population level.\n\nAccording to World Bank data, global per capita GDP fell by an average of 4.4% in 2020, the largest drop on record.3 Economies such as China and India have achieved per capita GDP growth rates well above the global average in the 21st century despite their populations of over a billion people apiece, thanks to the financial reforms initiated by China in the late 1970s and India in the mid-1990s.4\n\n## Nations With the Highest Per Capita GDP\n\nBelow are the top 10 nations with the highest per capita GDP as of September 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).5\n\nPer Capita GDP**CountryGDP per capita (USD)**Luxembourg$137,950Ireland$108,160Switzerland$98,770Norway$84,120United States$74,730Iceland$72,320Denmark$70,770Singapore$69,130Australia$64,900Qatar$64,770\n\nMany of the nations on the list have relatively small populations. [Luxembourg](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/wealth-management/121515/top-10-european-tax-havens.asp), at the top of the list, has one of the smallest populations at 650,000 people.6 Most of the small population countries are energy exporters, regional financial centers, and export business powerhouses.\n\n## Per Capita GDP Forecasts\n\nThe IMF provides a regular outlook on global growth with insights on both GDP and GDP per capita updated in its data mapper. It expects little change in the rankings of the top ten countries as sluggish growth data is trending across the globe.\n\nThe IMF expects the global economy to slowdown following a bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic. A January IMF report projects GDP growth worldwide of 4.4% in 2022 after posting 5.9% growth in 2021.7\n\n## How Do You Calculate GDP Per Capita?\n\nThe formula to calculate GDP per capita is a country's gross domestic product (GDP) divided by its population. This calculation reflects a nation's standard of living.\n\n## Which Countries Have the Highest GDP Per Capita?\n\nThe countries with the highest GDP per capita are Luxembourg, Ireland, and Switzerland.5\n\n## What Is the Difference Between GDP Per Capita and Per Capita Income?\n\nGDP per capita measures the economic output of a nation per person. It seeks to determine the prosperity of a nation by economic growth per person in that nation. Per capita income measures the amount of money earned per person in a nation. This metric seeks to evaluate the average per-person income for a given region in order to determine the standard of living and quality of life of a population.", "timestamp": 1655170515, "digest": "RuEFSR_uR80ECJjfp5B7hJJiekZn85xkheXFnfa0ln0", "contributor": "0x1E31CCC863220CBBC6aBC9454151ddBfdEfd6Cf2"}
{"id": "5G7bFKUw2Tf4ZejiyHvtslTK2O2clJMjtOC02PkBiF0", "title": "Penny Stock", "body": "## What Is a Penny Stock?\n\nA penny stock typically refers to the stock of a small company that trades for less than $5 per share. Though some penny stocks trade on large exchanges such as the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE), most trade via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions through the electronic [OTC Bulletin Board](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp) (OTCBB) or through the privately-owned [OTC Markets Group](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc-markets-group-inc.asp). There is no trading floor for OTC transactions. Quotations are also all done electronically.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 32 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:32\n\n#### Penny Stocks\n\n## Penny Stocks Explained\n\nIn the past, penny stocks were considered any stocks that traded for less than one dollar per share. The U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) has modified the definition to include all shares trading below five dollars. The SEC is an independent federal government agency responsible for protecting investors as they maintain fair and orderly functioning of the [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) markets.\n\nPenny stocks are usually associated with small companies and trade infrequently meaning they have a lack of liquidity or ready buyers in the marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to sell stock since there may not be any buyers at that time. Because of the low liquidity, investors might have difficulty finding a price that accurately reflects the market.\n\nDue to their lack of liquidity, wide bid-ask spreads or price quotes, and small company sizes, penny stocks are generally considered highly speculative. In other words, investors could lose a sizable amount or all of their investment.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A penny stock refers to a small company's stock that typically trades for less than $5 per share. \n* Although some penny stocks trade on large exchanges such as the NYSE, most penny stocks trade over the counter through the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB).\n* While there can be sizable gains in trading penny stocks, there are also equal risks of losing a significant amount of an investment in a short period.\n\n## Price Fluctuations of Penny Stocks\n\nPenny stocks offered on the marketplace are often growing companies with limited cash and resources. Since these are primarily small companies, penny stocks are most suitable for investors who have a [high tolerance for risk](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/050203.asp).\n\nTypically, penny stocks have a higher level of volatility, resulting in a higher potential for reward and, thus, a higher level of inherent risk. Investors may lose their entire investment on a penny stock, or more than their investment if they [buy on margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buying-on-margin.asp), which means the investor borrowed funds from a bank or broker to purchase the shares.\n\nConsidering the heightened risk levels associated with investing in penny stocks, investors should take particular precautions. For example, an investor should have a [stop-loss order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) predetermined before entering a trade and know what price level to exit if the market moves opposite of the intended direction. Stop-loss orders set a price limit that, once reached, will trigger an automatic sell of the securities.\n\nAlthough penny stocks can have explosive gains, it is important to have realistic expectations and understand that penny stocks are high-risk investments with low trading volumes.\n\n## What Makes Penny Stocks Risky\n\nPenny stocks do provide some small businesses with a way to access funding from the public. These companies may use this platform as a starting block to move into a larger marketplace. Also, since they sell at such low prices, there is room for significant upside. However, some factors exacerbate the risk associated with investing or trading penny stocks. Securities are usually riskier than more established companies known as [blue-chip](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp) stocks.\n\nA blue chip is a nationally recognized, well-established, and financially sound company. Blue chips generally sell high-quality, widely accepted products and services. Blue-chip companies typically have a history of weathering downturns and [operate profitably in the face of adverse economic conditions](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031915/what-benefit-investing-blue-chip-stocks.asp), which helps to contribute to their long record of stable and reliable growth.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 45 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:45\n\n#### Why Do Penny Stocks Fail?\n\n### Lack of Information Available to the Public\n\nWhen considering options for potential investments, it's important to have enough information to make an informed decision. For some penny stocks, information on corporate performance can be very difficult to find. When this is the case, the information that is available about them may not come from credible sources.\n\nStocks traded on the OTCBB carry the \"OB\" suffix to their symbol. These companies file financial statements with the SEC. However, companies listed on the [pink sheets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp) are not required to file with the SEC. As such these businesses do not receive the same public scrutiny or regulation as the stocks represented on the NYSE, the Nasdaq, and [other markets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/security-market-usa.asp).\n\n### No Minimum Standards\n\nStocks on the OTCBB and pink sheets do not have to fulfill minimum standard requirements to remain available for sale through OTC exchanges. Once a company can no longer maintain its listing position on one of the major exchanges, the company can move to one of the smaller OTC listing exchanges. Minimum standards can act as a safety cushion for some investors. When a company is not subject to higher standards, investing in that company becomes much riskier.\n\n### Lack of History\n\nMany of the companies considered to be penny stocks could be newly formed, and some could be approaching [bankruptcy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp). These companies will generally have poor track records or no track record at all. As you can imagine, this lack of historical information makes it difficult to determine a stock's potential.\n\n### Liquidity and Fraud\n\nStocks that trade infrequently do not have much [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp). As a result, it is possible that investors won't be able to sell the stock once it is acquired. The investors might need to lower their price until it is considered attractive to another buyer.\n\nLow liquidity levels also provide opportunities for some traders to manipulate stock prices. The [pump and dump](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pumpanddump.asp) scheme is a popular trading scam to lure investors into buying a stock. Large amounts of a penny stock are purchased followed by a period when the stock is hyped up or pumped up. Once other investors rush to buy the stock, the scammers sell their shares. Once the market realizes there was no fundamental reason for the stock to rise, investors rush to sell and can take on heavy losses.\n\nPros\n\n* Offer a place for small companies to gain access public funding.\n* In some cases, penny stocks may provide a method to gain access to larger marketplace listing.\n* With a lower price, penny stocks allow for significant upside in share appreciation.\n\nCons\n\n* Penny stocks lack a liquid market with few buyers, perhaps even after their price has increased.\n* There is limited information available on the company's financial record.\n* Penny stocks have a high probability of fraud and bankruptcy of the underlying company.\n\n## Signs of Fraud\n\nThough there is no fool-proof strategy for knowing which penny stocks are fraudulent, the SEC recommends that investors heed the following warning signs in a company's record: [SEC trading suspensions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/suspended_trading.asp), large assets but small revenues, financial statements containing unusual items in the footnotes, odd auditing issues, and large insider ownership.1﻿\n\n## Real-World Example of Penny Stock Fraud\n\nCalifornia resident Zirk de Maison created nearly half of a dozen shell companies and offered them as penny stocks to investors between 2008 and 2013, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). De Maison told investors that the companies engaged in a variety of businesses, such as gold mining and diamond trading when, in fact, they did nothing. He sold the stocks in \"boiler rooms,\" offices where [brokers use high-pressure tactics](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/122315/illegal-highpressure-sales-tactics-brokers-use.asp) to push people into buying stocks by promising large profits. In 2015, de Maison and seven other perpetrators were found guilty of securities fraud and sentenced to federal prison.2﻿ \n\n## How Is a Penny Stock Created?\n\nSmall companies and [startups](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp) typically issue stock as a means of raising capital to grow the business. Although the process is lengthy, issuing stock is often one of the quickest and most effective ways for a startup company to obtain capital.\n\nA penny stock, like any other publicly traded stock, is created through a process called an initial public offering or IPO. To be listed on the OTCBB the company must first file a registration statement with the SEC or file stating the offering qualifies for an exemption from registration. It must also check state securities laws in the locations it plans to sell the stock. Once approved, the company may begin the process of soliciting orders from investors.\n\nFinally, the company can apply to have the stock listed on a larger exchange, or it can trade on the over-the-counter market.\n\n### Underwriting Penny Stock\n\nAs with other new offerings, the first step is hiring an underwriter, usually an attorney or investment bank specializing in securities offerings. The company's offering either needs to be registered with the SEC, according to Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933, or file under [Regulation D](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationd.asp) if exempt. If the company is required to register, Form 1-A, the registration statement, must be filed with the SEC along with the company's financial statements and proposed sales materials.\n\nThe financial statements need to remain available for the public to review, and timely reports must be filed with the SEC to maintain the public offering. Once approved by the SEC, orders for shares may be solicited from the public by accompanying sales materials and disclosures, such as a [prospectus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp).\n\n### Trading Penny Stocks\n\nAfter initial orders are collected and the stock is sold to investors, a registered offering can begin trading in the secondary market by listing on an exchange like the NYSE, Nasdaq, or trade over-the-counter. Many penny stocks wind up trading via OTC due to the strict [requirements for listing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listingrequirements.asp) on the larger exchanges.\n\nSometimes companies make an additional secondary market offering after the IPO, which dilutes the existing shares but gives the company access to more investors and increased capital. Furthermore, it is mandatory that the companies continue to publicly provide updated financial statements to keep investors informed and maintain the ability for quoting on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.\n\n## The SEC's Rules for Penny Stocks \n\nPenny stocks are considered highly speculative investments. To protect investors, the SEC and [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp) (FINRA) have rules to regulate the trading of penny stocks. All broker-dealers must comply with Section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the accompanying rules to be eligible to handle penny stock transactions.3\n\n* Following Exchange Act rules of §240.15g-9, the broker-dealer must approve the investor's transaction and make sure the investment is suitable for their purchase.4 \n* They must provide the customer with a standardized disclosure document as outlined in §240.15g-2. This document explains the risks associated with buying penny stocks, customer rights, and solutions in cases of fraud.5\n* Rule §240.15g-3 requires broker-dealers to disclose and confirm currently quoted prices before completing a penny stock transaction.6\n* Rule §240.15g-4 states the broker must tell the investor about the funds the broker earns from facilitating the transaction.7\n* Brokers must send monthly account statements that include details of the number and identity of each penny stock in the customer's account, as described by rule §240.15g-6. These statements must explain that the penny stock has limited market liquidity and provide an estimate of what they think the shares are worth in this limited market.8\n\n## After-Hours Trading\n\nPenny stocks can be traded after-hours, and since many significant market movements can happen after exchanges close, penny stocks are subject to [volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) fluctuations after-hours. If penny stock investors execute buy or sell trades after-hours, they may able to sell shares for very high prices or purchase shares for very low prices.\n\nHowever, even the best penny stocks are subject to low liquidity and inferior reporting. Also, if a penny stock does spike after-hours, an investor looking to sell the stock might have a hard time finding a buyer. Penny stocks infrequently trade, even more so after market hours, which can make it difficult to buy and sell after-hours.\n\n## When Is It Not a Penny Stock?\n\nMultiple events can trigger the transition of a penny stock to a regular stock. The company can issue new securities in an offering that is registered with the SEC, or it can register an existing class of securities with the regulatory body.\n\nBoth types of transactions automatically require the firm to adhere to periodic reporting, including disclosures to investors about its business activities, financial conditions, and company management unless there is an exemption. These filings also mandate 10-Q quarterly reports, [the annual Form 10-K](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp), and periodic Form 8-K reports, which detail unexpected and significant events.\n\nIn some instances, there are additional conditions that will require a company to file reports with the SEC. Reports must be filed if a company has either at least 2,000 investors, more than 500 investors that can’t be categorized as accredited investors, and possesses more than US$10 million in assets.\n\nUsually, companies with no more than $10 million in assets and fewer than 2,000 recorded shareholders don’t have to adhere to reporting guidelines under the SEC.9﻿﻿ Interestingly enough, some companies opt for transparency by filing the same types of reports that other, perhaps more reputable, firms are required to do.\n\n## Example of a Penny Stock\n\nMost penny stocks don’t trade on the major market exchanges. However, there are some large companies, based on market capitalization, that trade below $5 per share on the main exchanges like the Nasdaq.\n\nOne example of a penny stock listed on the Nasdaq is Catalyst Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CPRX), a small biopharmaceutical company based in Coral Gables, Florida. As of Jan. 7, 2021, the stock price is $3.55 per share. In the last 12 months, the share price has fluctuated between $2 and $5. On August 10, 2020, the stock closed at $4.26; however, the next day the price fell to $3.34 a drop of nearly 22%.10﻿\n\nAlthough there can be sizable gains in trading penny stocks, there are also equal or larger risks of losing a significant amount of an investment in a short period.", "timestamp": 1655170410, "digest": "GERftvWr7iPYFkG5VFlg_v7eo5OEKkOnIX9s49KJHo8", "contributor": "0xA2217C1E8E3d6CF606cfdd753e1c70b5685d2aAE"}

Potential funding sources were confused when they started talking about international organizational structures functioning in a level field where anything was possible. However, in web3 DAOs are common and people regularly work with an international community to push ideas forward. Thanks to Gitcoin and Giveth, Bloom Network is growing and in a few months time will be in full blossom after over a decade of work.\n\nCome July 2nd they will have their first legal entity for supporting the DAO structure, a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association (LCA) (thanks to an [all female legal team](https://jrwiener.com/)). Membership fees collected go 80% to local Bloom Network Orgs and 20% to Bloom International. Once the LCA is established Bloom Network will be able to issue the $FLO or Flower token.\n\n$FLO token basic design\n\n* Tokens distributed when Regenerative Actions Logged\n* COOP Patronage Reward Tokens\n* Governance Power\n* Further Decentralizing the Organization\n* Connecting the International Regenerative Network Together\n\nThese tokens will allow all of the people that have been and will be part of Bloom Network to inter cooperate across many different countries, which would be very clunky if using a fiat finance system and would have intermediary fees (not to mention [31% of adults are unbanked](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf)). The tokens embrace the values of Bloom Network and are able to connect people together through that. Tokens can be put up as bounty rewards to encourage a decentralized community to work together on internationally relevant projects and support each other. These tokens will be one of the cheapest and fastest ways to get funding channeled to grassroots projects on the ground. Bloom Network also realizes they are part of a larger ReFi movement and have already started conversations with Orgo and other ReFi organizations to see how they can allow their members to benefit from the shared infrastructure for regeneration this movement is building.\n\nOn the other side of the tech stack, with over a decade working on Bloom Network, a lot of knowledge has been accumulated and needs to be channeled for increased scalability and replicability. Bloom Network has been working on a [multi user blogging platform](https://bloomnetwork.org/preview-of-bloom-networks-forthcoming-platform/) that is completely focused on regenerative actions. This platform will feature templates people anywhere can use to start a community garden or a crop swap, or know what to do year one on the land with forest repair or how to do regenerative agriculture in different areas. These templates will allow people to harness what it has taken Bloom Network members years to learn and run with it. Allowing people to carry our regenerative climate action a lot faster. Along with that, it will help more people find and participate in regenerative action projects and grassroots projects. This platform is somewhere between three weeks to a couple months out depending on funding resources.\n\nThe Bloom Network is GROWING and it is all possible thanks to people connecting with one another and the local community around them.

{"id": "gUCZ8iDrq7o9E6YDfq59EzbW5b-tyQNXQeyg9lB8LFA", "title": "Perfect Competition", "body": "## What Is Perfect Competition?\n\nThe term perfect competition refers to a theoretical market structure. In a perfect competition model, there are no monopolies. This kind of structure has a number of key characteristics, including:\n\n* All firms sell an identical product (the product is a commodity or homogeneous).\n* All firms are [price takers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetaker.asp) (they cannot influence the market price of their products).\n* Market share has no influence on prices.\n* Buyers have complete or perfect information (in the past, present, and future) about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm.\n* Capital resources and labor are perfectly mobile.\n* Firms can enter or exit the market without cost.\n\nThis can be contrasted with the more realistic [imperfect competition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imperfect_competition.asp), which exists whenever a market, hypothetical or real, violates the abstract tenets of neoclassical pure or perfect competition.\n\nSince all real markets exist outside of the plane of the perfect competition model, each can be classified as [imperfect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imperfectmarket.asp). The contemporary theory of [imperfect versus perfect competition](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-difference-between-perfect-and-imperfect-competition.asp) stems from the Cambridge tradition of post-classical economic thought.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Perfect competition is an ideal type of market structure where all producers and consumers have full and symmetric information and no transaction costs.\n* There are a large number of producers and consumers competing with one another in this kind of environment.\n* Perfect competition is theoretically the opposite of a monopolistic market.\n* Since all real markets exist outside of the plane of the perfect competition model, each can be classified as imperfect.\n* The opposite of perfect competition is imperfect competition, which exists when a market violates the abstract tenets of neoclassical pure or perfect competition.\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 16 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n2:16\n\n#### Perfect Competition\n\n## How Perfect Competition Works\n\nPerfect competition is a benchmark or ideal type to which real-life market structures can be compared. Perfect competition is [theoretically the opposite](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-difference-between-monopolistic-market-and-perfect-competition.asp) of a [monopoly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp), in which only a single firm supplies a good or service and that firm can charge whatever price it wants since consumers have no alternatives and it is difficult for would-be competitors to enter the marketplace.\n\nUnder perfect competition, there are many buyers and sellers, and prices reflect [supply and demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp). Companies earn just enough profit to stay in business and no more. If they were to earn excess profits, other companies would enter the market and drive profits down. \n\n### A Large and Homogeneous Market \n\nThere are a large number of buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market. The sellers are small firms, instead of large [corporations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp) capable of controlling prices through supply adjustments. They sell products with minimal differences in capabilities, features, and pricing. This ensures that buyers cannot distinguish between products based on physical attributes, such as size or color, or intangible values, such as branding.\n\nA large population of both buyers and sellers ensures that supply and demand remain constant in this market. As such, buyers can easily substitute products made by one firm for another. \n\n### Perfect Information Availability  \n\nInformation about an industry's ecosystem and competition constitutes a significant advantage. For example, knowledge about component sourcing and supplier pricing can make or break the market for certain companies. In certain knowledge and [research-intensive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetoresearchratio.asp) industries, such as pharmaceuticals and technology, information about patents and research initiatives at competitors can help companies develop competitive strategies and build a moat around their products.\n\nThe availability of free and equal information in a perfectly competitive market ensures that each firm can produce its goods or services at exactly the same rate and with the same production techniques as another one in the market.\n\n### Absence of Controls  \n\nGovernments play a vital role in market formation for products by imposing regulations and price controls. They can control the entry and exit of firms into a market by setting up rules to function in the market. For example, the pharmaceutical industry has to contend with a roster of rules pertaining to the development, production, and sale of drugs.1\n\nIn turn, these rules require big [capital investments ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-investment.asp)in the form of employees, such as lawyers and quality assurance personnel, and infrastructure, such as machinery to manufacture medicines. The cumulative costs add up and make it extremely expensive for companies to bring a drug to the market.\n\nIn comparison, the technology industry functions with relatively less oversight as compared to its pharma counterpart. Thus, entrepreneurs in this industry can start firms with less to zero [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp), making it easy for individuals to start a company in the industry. \n\nSuch controls do not exist in a perfectly competitive [market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp). The entry and exit of firms in such a market are unregulated, and this frees them up to spend on labor and capital assets without restrictions and adjust their output in relation to market demands.\n\n### Cheap and Efficient Transportation\n\nCheap and efficient transportation is another characteristic of perfect competition. In this type of market, companies do not incur significant costs to transport goods. This helps reduce the product’s price and cuts back on delays in transporting goods. \n\n## Special Considerations\n\nReal-world competition differs from this ideal primarily because of [differentiation in production, marketing, and selling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product_differentiation.asp). For example, the owner of a small organic products shop can talk extensively about the grain fed to the cows that made the manure that fertilized the non-GMO soybeans. This is what's called differentiation.\n\nThe first two criteria (homogeneous products and price takers) are far from realistic. Yet, for the second two criteria (information and mobility) the global tech and trade transformation is improving information and resource flexibility. While the reality is far from this theoretical model, the model is still helpful because of its ability to explain many real-life behaviors.\n\n### \n\n*Companies seek to establish brand value through marketing around their differentiation. As such, they advertise to gain pricing power and market share.*\n\n### Barriers to Entry Prohibit Perfect Competition\n\nMany industries also have significant [barriers to entry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrierstoentry.asp), such as high [startup costs](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/business-startup-costs.asp) (as seen in the auto manufacturing industry) or strict government regulations (as seen in the utility industry), which limit the ability of firms to enter and exit such industries. And although consumer awareness has increased with the information age, there are still few industries where the buyer remains aware of all available products and prices.\n\nSignificant obstacles exist that prevent perfect competition from developing in the [economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp). The agricultural industry probably comes closest to exhibiting perfect competition because it is characterized by many small producers with virtually no ability to alter the selling price of their products. The commercial buyers of agricultural commodities are generally very well-informed and, although agricultural production involves some barriers to entry, it is not particularly difficult to enter the marketplace as a producer.\n\n## Criticism of Perfect Competition\n\nPerfect competition establishes an idealized framework for establishing a market. But that market is flawed and has a couple of disadvantages. The first one is the absence of innovation. The prospect of greater market share and setting themselves apart from the competition is an incentive for firms to innovate and make better products. But no firm possesses a dominant [market share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp) in perfect competition.\n\n[Profit margins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp) are also fixed by [demand and supply](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/intro-supply-demand.asp). Firms cannot thus set themselves apart by charging a premium for their product and services. For instance, it would be impossible for a company like Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)) to exist in a perfectly competitive market because its phones are pricier than its competitors.\n\nAnother disadvantage is the absence of [economies of scale](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp). Limited to zero profit margins means that companies will have less cash to invest in expanding their production capabilities. An expansion of production capabilities could potentially bring down costs for consumers and increase business profit margins. But the presence of several small firms cannibalizing the market for the same product prevents this and ensures that the average firm size remains small.\n\n### Do Firms Profit in Perfect Competition?\n\nProfits may be possible for brief periods in perfectly competitive markets. But the market’s dynamics cancel out the effects of positive or negative [profits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp) and bring them toward an equilibrium. Because there is no information asymmetry in the market, other firms will quickly ramp up their production or reduce their manufacturing costs to achieve parity with the firm which made profits.\n\nThe [average revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arpu.asp) and marginal revenue for firms in a perfectly competitive market are equal to the product’s price to the buyer. As a result, the perfectly competitive market’s equilibrium, which had been disrupted earlier, will be restored. In the long run, an adjustment of supply and demand ensures all profits or losses in such markets tend towards zero.\n\n## Examples of Perfect Competition \n\nAs mentioned earlier, perfect competition is a theoretical construct and doesn't actually exist. As such, it is difficult to find real-life examples of perfect competition but there are variants present in everyday society.\n\n### Produce\n\nConsider the situation at a farmer’s market, a place characterized by a large number of small sellers and buyers. There is typically little [differentiation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product_differentiation.asp) between products and their prices from one farmer’s market to another. How the produce is grown does not matter (unless they are classified as organic) and there is very little difference in how they're packaged or branded. Thus, even if one of the farms producing goods for the market goes out of business, it will not make a difference to average prices.\n\n### Supermarkets\n\nThe situation may also be relatively similar in the case of two competing supermarkets, which stock their aisles from the same set of companies. Again, there is little to distinguish products from one another between both supermarkets and their pricing remains almost the same. Another example of perfect competition is the market for unbranded products, which features cheaper versions of well-known products.\n\n### Knockoffs\n\nProduct knockoffs are generally priced similarly and there is little to differentiate them from one another. If one of the firms manufacturing such a product goes out of business, it is replaced by another one.\n\n### Technology\n\nThe development of new markets in the technology industry also resembles perfect competition to a certain degree. For example, there was a proliferation of sites offering similar services during the early days of social media networks. Some examples of such sites are Sixdegrees.com, Blackplanet.com, and Asianave.com. None of them had a dominant market share and the sites were mostly free. They constituted sellers in the market while consumers of such sites, who were mainly young people, were the buyers.\n\nThe [startup](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp) costs for companies in this space were minimal, meaning that startups and companies can freely enter and exit these markets. Technologies, such as PHP and Java, were largely open-source and available to anyone. Capital costs, in the form of real estate and [infrastructure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp), were not necessary. Remember that Meta's ([META](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=META)), formerly Facebook, founder Mark Zuckerberg started the company from his college dorm. \n \n\n## What Is Perfect Competition?\n\nIn economic theory, perfect competition occurs when all companies sell identical products, market share does not influence price, companies are able to enter or exit without barrier, buyers have perfect or full information, and companies cannot determine prices. In other words, it is a market that is entirely influenced by market forces. It is the opposite of imperfect competition, which is a more accurate reflection of a current market structure.\n\n## What Is an Example of Perfect Competition?\n\nConsider a farmers market where each vendor sells the same type of jam. There is little differentiation between each of their products, as they use the same recipe, and they each sell them at an equal price. At the same time, sellers are few and free to participate in the market without any barrier. Buyers, in this case, would be fully knowledgeable of the product’s recipe, and any other information relevant to the good.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between Perfect Competition and Imperfect Competition?\n\nWhile perfect competition is an idealized market structure in which equal and identical products are sold, imperfect competition can be found in monopolies and real-life examples. For instance, imperfect competition involves companies competing for market share, high barriers to entry, and buyers lacking complete information on a product or service. Unlike perfect competition, however, this creates the incentive to innovate and produce better products, in addition to increased profit margins due to the influence of supply and demand.", "timestamp": 1655170627, "digest": "aGL-SZY4ZmWEEzS_ATEw2pT_MElbswCDhbqJYlT6y2c", "contributor": "0x587c0b39237607228BeD1773C34589570E4A09dC"}

{"id": "NxuXdq06xU-PZ8KRYwjChyO6S7hIeSA037vF_UKDKGk", "title": "Journal", "body": "## What Is a Journal?\n\nA journal is a detailed account that records all the financial transactions of a business, to be used for the future reconciling of accounts and the transfer of information to other official accounting records, such as the [general ledger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalledger.asp). A journal states the date of a transaction, which accounts were affected, and the amounts, usually in a [double-entry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp) bookkeeping method.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A journal is a detailed record of all the transactions done by a business.\n* Reconciling accounts and transferring information to other accounting records is done using the information recorded in a journal.\n* When a transaction is recorded in a company's journal, it's usually recorded using a double-entry method, but can also be recorded using a single-entry method of bookkeeping.\n* The double-entry method reflects changes in two accounts after a transaction has occurred; an increase in one and a decrease in the corresponding account.\n* Single-entry bookkeeping is rarely used and only notes changes in one account.\n* A journal is also used in the financial world to refer to a trading journal that details the trades made by an investor and why.\n\n## Understanding a Journal\n\nFor [accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting.asp) purposes, a journal is a physical record or digital document kept as a book, spreadsheet, or data within accounting software. When a business transaction is made, a bookkeeper enters the financial transaction as a journal entry. If the expense or income affects one or more business accounts, the journal entry will detail that as well.\n\nJournaling is an essential part of objective record-keeping and allows for concise reviews and records-transfer later in the accounting process. Journals are often reviewed as part of a trade or audit process, along with the general ledger.\n\nTypical information that is recorded in a journal includes sales, expenses, movements of cash, inventory, and [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp). It is advised to record this information as it happens as opposed to later so that the information is recorded accurately without any guesswork at a later date.\n\nHaving an accurate journal is not only important for the success of a business, by spotting errors and [budgeting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp) correctly, but is also imperative when taxes are filed.\n\n## Using Double-Entry Bookkeeping in Journals\n\nDouble-entry bookkeeping is the most common form of accounting. It directly affects the way journals are kept and how journal entries are recorded. Every business transaction is made up of an exchange between two accounts.\n\nThis means that each journal entry is recorded with two columns. For example, if a business owner purchases $1,000 worth of [inventory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp) with cash, the bookkeeper records two transactions in a journal entry. The [cash account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashaccount.asp) decreases by $1,000, and the inventory account, which is a current asset, increases by $1,000.\n\n## Using Single-Entry Bookkeeping in Journals\n\nSingle-entry bookkeeping is rarely used in accounting and business. It is the most basic form of accounting and is set up like a checkbook, in that there is only a single account used for each journal entry. It is a simple running total of [cash inflows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) and cash outflows.\n\nIf, for example, a business owner purchases $1,000 worth of inventory with cash, the single-entry system records a $1,000 reduction in cash, with the total ending balance below it. It is possible to separate income and expenses into two columns so a business can track total income and total expenses, and not just the aggregate ending balance.\n\n## The Journal in Investing and Trading\n\nA journal is also used in the investment finance sector. For an individual investor or professional manager, a journal is a comprehensive and detailed record of trades occurring in the investor's own accounts, which is used for tax, evaluation, and [auditing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp) purposes.\n\n[Traders use journals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blotter.asp) to keep a quantifiable chronicle of their trading performance over time in order to learn from past successes and failures. Although past performance is not a predictor of future performance, a trader can use a journal to learn as much as possible from their trading history, including the emotional elements as to why a trader may have gone against their chosen strategy.\n\nThe journal typically has a record of profitable trades, unprofitable trades, watch lists, pre- and post-market records, notes on why an investment was purchased or sold, and so on.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvHK7KCXEK0IHZTb6yaXabRELfuorw3PfYkb1ykH9LTGkIJ7h2kvKJ7aDgDGzqmsSl2S3ZLYZnPR_MENSdTf8OeL094yainwCLxYTkWyNrHsniLZesgiTsNM4mMqOVbkv9B7S1V8PASdSVBukfGZ8ftzZGrDaT5V-KqU3LHl9YD0wWs4QRvrAg9ngJLnlok-VngFD2bl0dl4b26ckX88Yl1i_aXexhteoecuB-tOzUJ5O_UOe3ZWM5upJK64I8Nwofi-0Bk1cG9EyNTmYSW_vOHxNaEWXfikWJJ6T-QlqBeZRknQ-odvcjJ0f67Fkf6UWnY2Xut0A4lpyghbnATlK4cznuQf_QS6yCDgCwEYmNDiSw&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEUjtb4FU8r6EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvHK7KCXEK0IHZTb6yaXabRELfuorw3PfYkb1ykH9LTGkIJ7h2kvKJ7aDgDGzqmsSl2S3ZLYZnPR_MENSdTf8OeL094yainwCLxYTkWyNrHsniLZesgiTsNM4mMqOVbkv9B7S1V8PASdSVBukfGZ8ftzZGrDaT5V-KqU3LHl9YD0wWs4QRvrAg9ngJLnlok-VngFD2bl0dl4b26ckX88Yl1i_aXexhteoecuB-tOzUJ5O_UOe3ZWM5upJK64I8Nwofi-0Bk1cG9EyNTmYSW_vOHxNaEWXfikWJJ6T-QlqBeZRknQ-odvcjJ0f67Fkf6UWnY2Xut0A4lpyghbnATlK4cznuQf_QS6yCDgCwEYmNDiSw&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEUjtb4FU8r6EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "tghc7GN9w9El6Unslq9na8FdT8QqX6UsxcBEM5n6NeQ", "title": "Joint Tenants With Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)", "body": "## What Is a Joint Tenant With Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)?\n\nThe term joint tenant with the right of survivorship (JTWROS) refers to a legal ownership structure involving two or more parties for any type of financial [account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/account.asp) or another asset. Each tenant has an equal right to the account's assets and is afforded survivorship rights if one of the account holder(s) dies. A surviving member inherits the total value of the other member's share of property upon the death of that other member.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A joint tenant with the right of survivorship is a legal ownership structure involving two or more parties for an account or another asset.\n* Each tenant has an equal right to the account's assets and is afforded survivorship rights if the other account holder(s) dies.\n* A surviving member inherits the total value of the other member's share of property upon the death of that other member.\n* A JTWROS can only be established if the owners acquire the property at the same time, have the same title on the asset(s), have an equal share in the property, must have the same right to possess the entirety of the assets.\n* This agreement avoids probate but does not allow ownership to be transferred to a deceased individual's heirs.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 11 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:11\n\n#### Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)\n\n## Understanding Joint Tenant With Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)\n\nContrary to what some people may believe, the term joint tenant with the right of survivorship has nothing to do with being a [lessee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lessee.asp) or tenant in a rental apartment. JTWROS is actually a legal concept that applies to individuals who own assets, accounts, or other types of [property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property.asp). It is actually a form of co-tenancy, which is why this arrangement is also often called a [joint tenancy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/joint-tenancy.asp).2\n\nCo-tenancy or joint tenancy is a concept in property law that is used to describe the various ways that a piece of property can be owned by two or more people at the same time. A JTWROS is one version of co-tenancy that gives co-owners equal rights to the [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) in addition to the right of survivorship. This means that both parties can freely use the asset as they please. But if one tenant dies, their ownership stake passes on to the surviving owner(s).1\n\nA JTWROS is most commonly used between married couples, or between a parent and their child. But it can also be established between parties who are not related. As noted above, this type of legal relationship can involve any number of financial accounts or assets, such as:\n\n* [Real estate](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/real-estate-investing-guide/)\n* Checking, savings accounts\n* [Mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp)\n* brokerage fund accounts\n\nThis relationship can be broken if one or more of the parties involved sells their interest in the asset to someone else. As such, it becomes a [tenancy in common (TIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenancy_in_common.asp), which is a less restrictive form of joint ownership.3\n\nAll members of a brokerage account are afforded the power to conduct investment transactions within the account.\n\n## Requirements for Joint Tenants With Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)\n\nThe creation of a JTWROS requires that the owners share what is known as four unities:\n\n* The would-be co-owners must acquire the assets in question at the same time.\n* The would-be co-owners must have the same title on the [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/what-is-an-asset.asp).\n* Regardless of the individual amounts that each owner has given or paid for the assets, each owner must have an equal share of the total assets, given as 1/n percent, where n is the total number of owners.\n* The would-be co-owners must each have the same right to possess the entirety of the assets.4\n\nA JTWROS cannot be created if any one of these four unities isn't established. The parties are then treated as tenants in common.\n\nThe language must be extremely clear when a JTWROS account is created. For instance, \"Mr. X and Mrs. Y are to be designated joint tenants with rights of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" This is necessary because a joint tenancy is automatically assumed to mean tenants in common in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## Joint Tenant With Right of Survivorship (JTWROS) vs. Tenancy in Common (TIC)\n\nA joint tenant with right of survivorship differs from a tenancy in common. While each party in a JTWROS has a right of survivorship over the asset, those in a TIC do not have the same legal right. Unless otherwise indicated, this means when a tenant dies, their ownership stake is passed on to an heir or other [beneficiary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp) of their choosing.3\n\nWhile parties in a JTWROS must have an equal stake in the asset or property, tenants in common aren't bound by this rule. Instead, this agreement allows parties to have different stakes in the property. For instance, three people may own a home together. If one individual has a 75% claim in the house, the other two are only able to have a 25% stake in the property.3\n\nUnlike a JTWROS, there are several ways for parties to terminate a TIC. They include:\n\n* Buying out the other party(s)\n* Selling the asset\n* One or more heirs selling their stake3\n\n### \n\n*Creditors with claims against a deceased account owner's assets, including a joint tenant with right of survivorship, may be settled using any of their previously owned assets.*\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Joint Tenant With Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)\n\nThere are a number of benefits to entering into a JTWROS. Despite these advantages, this type of arrangement does come with certain drawbacks. We've listed some of the most common [advantages and disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/joint-tenancy.asp#ixzz5KszLw7Nv) of being a joint tenant with right of survivorship below.\n\n### Advantages\n\nEntering into a JTWROS avoids [probate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probate.asp), which is the legal process where a person's will is proven in court and accepted to be a valid legal document. The deceased owner's heirs cannot inherit their property once a JTWROS is established. This means that the last living owner of the property owns all of the assets. They then become part of this individual's estate.\n\nSurvivorship also provides the remaining party(s) with other benefits in addition to avoiding probate. Surviving parties are allowed to continue using the [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/what-is-an-asset.asp) without any interference from outside parties, including a deceased party's heirs.\n\nEach party in a JTWROS must contribute to the property equally, in addition to holding an equal share and equal access to it. This means they must put in an equal share of any bills, such as [property taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/propertytax.asp), maintenance, or repairs. This takes the burden off one individual and spreads it out between everyone in the relationship.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\nThe most obvious disadvantage is that individuals can't pass or will their ownership stake to their heirs. Those who want to own property but don't want to give survivorship to the other owner(s) shouldn't consider this kind of agreement.\n\nEveryone should ensure they have a stable and solid relationship before they enter into an agreement like a JTWROS. If relations between parties go south, it can impact the agreement.\n\nIndividuals should be sure they can afford the asset before they enter into a JTWROS. Financial strains can put a damper on the agreement, especially when one individual is doing their part. For instance, if one individual can't keep up with their financial obligations to repair a home or make payments on a [mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp), it could have a negative effect on the other party.\n\nPros\n\n* Avoids probate\n* Allows survivors to use assets without outside interference\n* Gives each party equal financial responsibility in addition to an equal stake\n\nCons\n\n* Parties can't will their ownership stake to heirs\n* Relationships can be strained\n* One party can be negatively impacted if the other doesn't live up to their responsibility\n\n## Joint Tenants With Right of Survivorship (JTWROS) FAQs\n\n### What Is the Difference Between Joint Tenancy With Right of Survivorship and Joint Tenancy?\n\nThe primary difference between a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship and a joint tenancy is that the former passes ownership to any surviving parties rather than to their heirs or other beneficiaries. It also avoids probate and gives each party equal access and an equal stake along with equal responsibility for the property.\n\n### What Are the Dangers of Joint Tenancy?\n\nJoint tenancy may lead to problems between parties if or when the personal relationship turns sour. It can also negatively impact one party if the other doesn't live up to their financial obligations. And it prevents owners from passing on their stake to someone of their choosing.\n\n### Can a Joint Tenancy With Right of Survivorship Sell Their Share?\n\nA joint tenant can sell their share of the asset to someone else. Doing so nullifies the agreement, turning it into a tenancy in common.\n\n### Does Right of Survivorship Override a Will?\n\nThe right of survivorship does override any wills that are in place. That's because this kind of arrangement avoids probate. But if the last surviving party in a JTWROS dies, the agreement no longer applies, which means the asset or property is included in their will and goes to their heirs.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nOwning property on your own can put a strain on your finances. But you can lessen the burden by entering into a special agreement with someone else. This agreement is called a joint tenant with the right of survivorship.

{"id": "_t-ijbsz-qCmQ9mbaQvbJ-19bzdnw5VEskuvTNToc-c", "title": "Jumbo Certificate of Deposit (CD)", "body": "## What Is a Jumbo Certificate of Deposit (CD)?\n\nA jumbo certificate of deposit is a CD that requires a higher minimum balance obligation than that required by traditional CDs. In return, the jumbo CD pays a higher rate of interest. A CD is a type of savings account that pays fixed or variable interest in exchange for depositors leaving their funds in the account until a specified date of maturity.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A jumbo CD usually has a minimum balance requirement of $100,000.\n* Although jumbo CDs have higher minimum balance requirements than traditional CDs, in return they pay a higher interest rate.\n* Jumbo CDs pay investors a fixed rate of interest, helping to stabilize returns in an investment portfolio by partly offsetting market risk.\n\n## Understanding Jumbo CDs\n\n[Traditional CDs typically offer a higher rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/best-cd-rates-4770214) than do standard savings accounts or interest-bearing checking accounts. In this same vein, the jumbo CD will pay an even higher rate than is offered by traditional CDs. Jumbos receive a higher rate because they require a larger minimum investment than the standard CD. Most jumbo CDs start at $100,000, but some financial institutions offering them may have a few products with lower entry points.1﻿﻿\n\nJumbo CDs are considered risk-free investments, because they’re insured up to $250,000 by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp). Credit unions also market jumbo CDs, and these funds find protection under the [National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ncua.asp).\n\nInvestors receive the premium—based on the fixed interest rate—as compensation for not having access to their money over the life of the account. A one-year jumbo CD that pays 1.5% interest, for example, may require that the funds remain locked up in the account for one year. Jumbo CDs can have term lengths as short as a few days or as long as a decade. However, the standard range is between three months and five years. And the longer the term, the higher the interest rate returned on the funds invested.\n\nUpon maturity of the CD, the financial institution returns the investor’s principal. Early withdrawals may be possible, depending on the terms of the product purchased. However, the investor will pay a penalty for early termination of the contract.\n\n### $250,000\n\n*The amount up to which the FDIC insures CDs.2*﻿﻿\n\n## Advantages of Jumbo CDs\n\nLarge institutional investors are the typical customer for jumbo CDs. These large institutions include banks, some large corporations, and pension funds. Primarily, this is due to the high minimum balance requirements. These customers use jumbo CDs as a temporary investment vehicle, as some issuers have tenures for as little as seven days. The short-term maturitie\n\ns allow institutional investors and companies to earn interest on idle money for short periods before rolling the funds into other ventures. These Jumbo CDs are instruments for treasury management of large corporations and money market instruments for large investors.\n\nOther than being paid to park their funds in these products, large investors use them as instruments to reduce their portfolio’s [market risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketrisk.asp) exposure. Market risk arises when the prices in the stock market fluctuate over time. As a result, stock portfolios can earn high returns, but they can also incur large losses. The steady interest paid on jumbo CDs helps offset and reduce the risk of negative returns that can happen from holding stocks.\n\nA business seeking a loan or other type of financing from a bank can pledge its jumbo CD as collateral, which is an asset held by a lender as security for a loan in the event the borrower falls behind or defaults on the loan payments. If the borrower defaults on the timely submission of payments, the lender can seize the collateral to recoup any losses. However, CDs held in retirement accounts cannot be pledged as collateral for loans.\n\nJumbo CDs can be used as collateral for loans.\n\n## Disadvantages of Jumbo CDs\n\nAlthough jumbo CDs have positive aspects of higher rates and FDIC protection, there are disadvantages to investing in them. Historically, jumbo CDs have paid a much higher rate than traditional CDs and savings accounts. Nevertheless, the differences between those returns have narrowed in recent years, making a jumbo CD a less-compelling investment.\n\n### Inflation risk\n\nJumbo CDs don’t typically [keep up with inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/cds-vs-inflation-are-they-keeping.asp). If the inflation rate in the economy is 2%, for example, and the interest rate on the CD is 2.5%, the investor is only earning 0.5% in real terms. To make an investment in a jumbo CD worthwhile, investors would need to lock in their funds for longer terms, resulting in a higher rate.\n\n### Early-withdrawal penalties\n\nShould the holder need these funds before the jumbo CD matures, withdrawing them would result in a financial penalty, which could be a fee assessed by the bank for the loss of interest earned to date. Each bank will have specific rules and guidelines for early withdrawals. If it’s likely that the funds might be needed before the CD’s maturity, investors might be better off investing the funds in an account that doesn’t have withdrawal restrictions, such as a high-interest savings account.\n\n### Interest rate risk\n\nAnother worry for jumbo CD investors is [interest rate risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp). This comes when current market interest rates rise above the one offered by the jumbo CD. If interest rates rise while investors are holding a Jumbo CD, they miss out on the higher rates they could have had if these funds had been available to invest elsewhere.\n\n### Reinvestment rate risk\n\nConversely, if interest rates fall during the holding period, at maturity the investor may not be able to reinvest the funds at a rate comparable to the CD. This hazard is known as [reinvestment risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestmentrisk.asp). Although jumbo CDs pay a higher rate at the onset as compared to other products, investors must weigh the pros and cons to ensure they don’t wind up with a lower return in the long term.\n\nPros\n\n* Jumbo CDs offer a steady rate of interest for the length of the holding term.\n* Jumbo CDs typically pay a higher interest rate than do traditional CDs or savings accounts.\n* The steady interest paid on jumbo CDs can partly offset the portfolio’s market risk of negative returns from holding stocks.\n* Jumbo CDs carry a guarantee of up to $250,000 per account by the FDIC or the NCUA.\n\nCons\n\n* Jumbo CDs pay a lower return than many other fixed-rate investments, such as bonds.\n* In a rising market interest rate environment, jumbo CDs face interest rate risk, as investors might hold a CD paying a lower rate.\n* Jumbo CDs don’t typically keep up with inflation, meaning prices could rise at a faster rate than the CD’s rate of return.\n* Investors cannot access their funds in jumbo CDs before maturity without incurring an early-withdrawal penalty.\n* Jumbo CDs can have high minimum balance requirements.\n\n## Examples of Jumbo CDs\n\nAccording to MagnifyMoney.com, Veridian Credit Union, founded in Waterloo, Iowa, in 1934, offers many types of CDs, including jumbo CDs.3﻿﻿ Examples of the jumbo rate as of Feb. 1, 2021, include:\n\n* A nine-month jumbo CD with a minimum $100,000 deposit pays 0.40%\n* An 18-month jumbo CD with a minimum $100,000 deposit pays 0.50%\n\nPlease note: The interest rates being offered can change at any time for new CDs and might be different depending on the state in which the depositor is located.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsus08C0KulOizg9tjLrcaf1QMGVA0qiwJ_7jVyNy4K4Szlpi1ziEM3XF0tq5Z0Q2G7K4Mg38yY2DZsxX2cuq2vJjNVkpJLxpOElSgrcZ-MmhE7FdvjCspKSAD-rBZidbLdarbaGOnis_rGyz_A15CgK6iAaibmutFtoZ2KAnlOafkwne-ysF0sk8DSfv3mtu2nQYK5nq4LFnQy1wdI_NBqldt_8jk9ypi4LMGEvtcvrgDNXXJMcgaXVChmdS2IlpI5DPmvtWKw-yqv7Cq50GsEipa0oiLPBKUanfR8mwix1OFJt2bZdtdlZrtLHxnk8snLhs0VwDKiPwQ&sig=Cg0ArKJSzB6u6YF9Jxo3EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

Worrying about rights management and their oversight has the potential to derail music on the internet going froward. Let’s give it up and figure out a new model.\n\nIn fact, we have great examples of how an industry that was once a form of entertainment is now becoming a form of expression. Look at gaming.\n\nMusic is begging to be open source. Hip hop music has been built on sampling and unleashed an unprecedented era of creativity, albeit with many legal hurdles , and much litigation. As we enter the phase of the internet where creators are at the center, why not encourage creativity instead of stifle it.\n\nTo do that, we’ll have to get past the idea that music is untouchable.\n\nMore generally, we should also move past the notion that every creative idea needs to be 100% original. In fact, that’s impossible. Every idea is linked to multiple references and many influences. Ideas are composable.\n\nThe music industry may never understand this or relinquish control over protections that power their business, especially after the catalog buying spree we’ve seen recently. Could this be where Web3 steps up? If we’re building new infrastructure to encourage massive global collaboration, why should music be left out.\n\nFUCK COPYRIGHTS\n\nOpen Source Music admits that all music exists along a continuum of ideas that are connected and welcomes more participants to the party. Blockchain technology allows a rich web of content to be captured around the original work to create a rich experience to measure the true cultural value of a work. All comments, fan art, reaction videos, and social media can be linked to show the true cultural value of a song. The crowd matters. A public history A user generated ecosystem that forms a new culture of openness and sharing.\n\nEvery idea is borrowed. Every published work is a rough draft. Lets increase the pace of innovation, use music to showcase what’s possible using this technology. Music makes us feel something. Why not let everyone express that.\n\nThis token will be used to build a user generated ecosystem for music that forges a new culture of openness and sharing.

Social media for interests.\n\n4/29/22\n\nPhlote is a community-owned and operated music discovery platform. The value of Phlote is the sum total of our community contributions. Our ability to curate talented artists into Web3 is reflected in the value of our unique social token, $PV1, which gives every member of Team Phlote an economic stake in its growth.\n\nTo facilitate the growth of our community, we've built a music TCR as a merit based community onboarding tool. created an open submission process that allows any music fan with an internet connection and a crypto wallet to earn $PV1 tokens for curating music on Phlote.xyz.\n\nWe're opening the door for people with a keen eye for talent to distinguish themselves as leading curatorial voices in Web3.\n\nHow do people get these tokens?\n\nEach day, our community members scan the music submissions on Phlote.xyz and co-sign the songs they like. Curators who receive co-signs, earn $PV1 tokens and earn the right to have a profile on Phlote.xyz to start building their track record.\n\nThis effort ensures Team Phlote controls how the community grows and helps guarantee that our path towards a truly community-owned platform - where curators are the owners and operators of the network - is in line with the open, transparent, and permission-less ethos of blockchain technology.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. $PV1 isn’t available for purchase and can only be earned through submission at Phlote.xyz.\n2. $PV1 will be distributed to anyone who submits music at Phlote.xyz and receives co-signs from current members of the community.\n3. Curators earn 15 $PV1 for each co-sign received.\n4. Curators earn higher status within the community as they earn more $PV1 tokens. 1 co-sign earns the right to have a unique profile on Phlote. Curators who earn 20 co-signs (300 $PV1) earn the right to become co-signers.\n5. The game will last until the total supply of 1,000,000 $PV1 tokens has been fully distributed to members of the community.\n\nThe Goal?\n\n1. To surface up-and-coming voices at the cross section of music and technology.\n2. To introduce the world's most talented, independent artists to the blockchain.\n3. To build Team Phlote into an elite community of artists and curators who will create the world's leading music discovery platform.\n\n4/27/22\n\nOur #1 Priority: A custom auction house that sells NFT editions at Vickrey Auction.

Phlote to test auction mechanics with NFT sale that decentralizes marketplace on Day 1.\n\n4/25/22\n\nThe full potential for Web3 are products that are 100% built, operated, and owned by the community around them. Platforms that are open for anyone to join, have a clear mission, and a value orientation. These platforms will be structured as user owned companies or DAOs.\n\nIn the music industry, many artists must fight to be heard. Music discovery is not designed to showcase the many talented vocalists, musicians, producers, songwriters who exist in the world, but should.\n\nWe propose a system that centers artists, curators, and collectors as the backbone of the music industry. One that incentivizes the discovery of new music, makes it easily sharable, and help artists to identify their core fans. This alternative path that allows great music to be heard and doesn’t require artists to sign away their creative rights or ownership to labels.\n\nThe opportunity allows a new set of internet users to participate. Now anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can earn tokens for phloting great music to Web3.\n\n4/20/22\n\nSome believe that music discovery is alive and well in the hands of streaming platforms like Spotify.  We disagree.\n\n1. Today music discovery is not happening for independent artists on streaming platforms. Sixty thousand songs are uploaded daily. Only major label supported artists get seen. The system is broken.\n2. Algorithms are an inferior way to spur word of mouth spread for indie artists. Human recommendations reign supreme in music discovery.\n3. The True Fans looking to find new music are coming to Web3 for the ability to discover new artists and buy in early via NFTs. Adding crypto may prove difficult for incumbent music platforms to implement.\n4. Users will begin to migrate to platforms that they help build, use, and co-own as a community. Spotify is not likely to revolutionize a business model that has been profitable for the executive team and shareholders.\n\nPhlote is designed to solve these issues for artists, curators, and True Fans.\n\n4/19/22\n\n## The Future of Online Curation\n\nFew people are just browsing the internet. Most are actively searching for things. Every day, Google processes 5.6 billion searches for 5 billion global internet users. The search results we see first are those that are ad supported, relegating the best information “below the fold”. In this scenario, Google and its advertisers win, while users are underserved by search 5.6 billion times per day. Sadly, we’ve grown accustomed to this just being the way it is.\n\nThe number of daily internet searches shows that the internet is an active space for discovery. We’re all looking to discover new ideas, new technology, new art, new music. So why would we tolerate an internet that makes it more difficult to find the best ideas and best information? We shouldn’t.\n\nOne reason why online communities became popular is because they allowed people to meet others like themselves and learn from one another. From blogs to chat rooms to threads, communities have always been where curated conversations have taken place, serving as the best source of information.\n\nOutside of online forums, internet curation is present, but not widely recognized for the value it brings to our online experience. Internet tastemakers are the source of cool internet shit and important instigators of ideas spreading by word of mouth. Depending on how close you are to the source determines how early you are to emerging internet culture, and culture in general.  That said, the value generated by curators is not matched by the compensation they receive for their time. Using music as the example, a large community of internet curators spend hours digging for new music only to receive benefits that are mostly intrinsic and derive from one's ability to say they found it first. What’s needed is a way for this work to be compensated commensurate with the value generated for creators and consumers.\n\nWith blockchain technology, this is now possible.\n\n4/15/22\n\n* Metrics\n  * #submissions\n  * #cosigns received/given\n  * volume of phlote tokens moved\n  * submissions/sale\n  * commissions\n  * reviews/listen\n  * submitter reviews/comments\n  * Value of NFTs sold\n  * OBP -

Post curation the listener should ideally be buying NFT's and creating their own playlists.\n  * What is the full depth of our TCR Token mechanics?\n    * Token value is driven by token demand for archive/index inclusion.\n    * Music submissions require tokens.\n    * Curation requires tokens.\n    * As more tokens are purchased/burned through the submission process, value accrues to Phlote Token Holders.\n    * A quality index creates demand to be included in the index, which translates into earnings for curators.\n      * Curators drive value for artists by taking the selling burden off of them.\n      * Should reviews be emotionally driven (how the art made the curator feel)\n        * That commentary could be more valuable than a simple rating and as valuable as providing the historical/cultural context for works.\n  * Dashboard could be used to show number of submissions, percentage reviewed, tokens staked, token inventory, archive.  Maybe we create a music inbox - goal is to get to inbox 0.\n  * Is there a feed?\n  * Are there recommendation engines that advertisers use that could be reframed to present users helpful information based on preferences?\n  * What should we take away from bitclout for our token economics and functionality? Betting on artists early before they even get on the platform - buying value in that artist.\n  * Idea - artists can mint a song as a rare 1 of 1 NFT that can be kept private or added to a public playlist\n    * This makes a whole new economy around rare tracks the artist can release outside of albums.\n    * Artists can put rare 1 of 1 songs on a playlist that is “pay to stream”\n  * If we're encouraging collection/playlisting, then rarity of songs will be a big driver of value and an important part of the ownership experience.  If we assume all curators are DJs that are using the TCR to source music for their sets, then we should absolutely figure out a way for them to be able to monetize their lists and share proceeds with the artists.\n  * One way is to let DJ's play sets and list/link to NFT's that are included in the set.\n  * NFTs owned will also be a part of everyone's profile.\n* **Appendix NOTES: July 31**\n  * Make the experience fun → gamified experience\n  * randomized rewards → builds hype → randomly get 10k\n\n2/17/22\n\nGuests; Saeed Bolden, Singh Cap Partners\n\n2/16/22\n\n* Operating Agreement signed\n* Social media branding updated\n* Guests: Odenz, Yana Sosnovskaya\n\n2/15/22\n\n* TCR Rollout\n  * Email activation + podcast/newsletter\n* Released First Episode of “Curator Call”\n* Polygon Intro\n* Guests: Stefanie Thomas, Sean Wilkes\n\n2/14/22\n\n* Guests: Harrison, Glue, Heno, Carter Brown, Odenz\n\n2/13/22\n\n* Rest Day\n\n2/12/22\n\n* Phlote Search Tokenomics\n  * Curation\n    * Curators buy NFT's and receive PV tokens to participate --> Establishes Eth/PV ratio\n    * Curators mint curation NFTs --> Higher ETH/PV\n    * Curators only gain \"exposure\" to treasury from having submissions staked (co-signed) by other curators.\n    * Unstaked tokens are burned at the end of the period.\n  * Artists\n    * Artists pay to sbmit songs --> Higher ETH/PV\n  * Rankings\n    * Curators ranked by tokens staked (points) and by number of co-signs received\n    * Payouts happen automatically at the end of each epoch.\n* Micro Algorithmic Curation Hedge Funds\n  * Track Record established and tracked.\n  * We curate the Highest Returns.\n  * Consider establishing a 1 week lag on curated versus externally shared content\n  * To start, keep search open and updated it in real time.\n    * Create an index of such quality that artists are compelled to submit.\n    * Maintain Free Search so that the information is always free.\n    * Having a permissionless minting platform underpin our submission process like Mint Split will allow Phlote to personally direct artists to our minting platform to support Phlote tokens and create custom smart contracts that have the following provisions banked in:\n      * social impact royalty\n      * curator credits\n      * automatic inclusion in Phlote Index\n      * Phlote economics - 80/15/5\n* Ranking\n  * Rankings are calculated per period based on points accrued from each curators curation and co-signing activity.\n  * The curator has three token balances\n    * Tokens purchased\n    * Tokens staked\n    * Tokens received\n  * Only tokens staked and received count towards rankings to encourage sharing and co-signing great content that others will enjoy :-)\n    * Some curators may not be compelled by game or social mechanics, preferring to prioritize  the opportunity to archive culture on chain as reward enough.\n  * Token staking rewards.\n    * (Point Multiple/Cost)\n    * Curator (+ 6x PV1)/$.5\n    * First cosigner (+ 5x PV1)/$.25\n    * Second cosigner (+ 4x PV1)/$.25\n    * Third cosigner (+ 3x  PV1)/$.25\n    * Fourth cosigner (+ 2x PV1)/$.25\n    * Firth cosigner (+ 1x PV1)/$.25\n  * PV1 - Phlote Vote 1 Tokens\n  * Those who stake tokens early have highest potential for to accrue points.\n  * Curators who mint submissions are only players who have potential for immediate financial benefit.\n* Rankings and Rewards\n  * Programmatic Rewards:\n    * Phlote Treasury is the reward pool.\n      * Top 3 winners get payouts as below.\n      * All participants have exposure to art portfolio through PV1 holdings.\n    * Continue 1 million token epochs.\n      * Liquid treasury assets (submission fees and curation NFT mint fees) earned over the period get paid out to top 3 curators as follows.\n        * 1st Place - 40%\n        * 2nd Place - 30%\n        * 3rd Place - 20%\n        * Phlote 10% + Yield (fee for Phlote platforms/partner curation)\n* Re-up\n  * At the end of each period, a set of new NFTs is minted and Vickery auctioned to restart the game.\n  * Participants in the current round have a chance to retain membership seat.\n* Revenue opportunities:\n  * This is a curation game that allows members to identify the highest quality digital assets.

We realized early on that our community has great taste. The first artist we identified, Billy Racxx, is now prolific across Web3. Jansport J is now a 2x Grammy nominated artist. Rocky Snyda and JayProb have been unleashed to take over NYC.  We believe in the power of our curation so much,that we’ve started to buy NFTs of the artists our community has introduced us to.\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/lukebars/reflections-ft-dupes->\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/jansportj/grimm>\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/theodoregrams/bad-jawn>\n* Recently, we brought live voting for songs to Twitter spaces. The results have been just as impressive as before, with the added benefits of live programming. We invite you to come join us every Tuesday at 7 pm. Each week’s winner gets minted on Catalog. We pay the gas fee and buy the NFT. We now plan to scale our efforts by opening the opportunity for anyone to participate as we curate and purchase NFT of artists emerging in Web3.\n* As curators, we want to tag the content we fw. Any writer will tell you that the most important thing your tag can carry is respect.

{"id": "X9yvAiGZ5ajkb0MdSuDv6Cd4Cf_aEe2-q7ZpLpsufqM", "title": "JPY (Japanese Yen)", "body": "## What Is JPY (Japanese Yen)?\n\nJPY is the currency abbreviation or the currency symbol for the Japanese yen (JPY), the currency for Japan. It is made up of 100 sen or 1000 rin and is often presented with a symbol that looks like the capital letter Y with two horizontal dashes through the center: ¥.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* JPY is the currency abbreviation or the currency symbol for the Japanese yen (JPY), the currency for Japan.\n* The yen was originally introduced by the Meiji government in 1871 as a measure to modernize the country economically.\n* The Japanese yen is the world's third-most traded currency and considered a reserve currency after the U.S. dollar.\n* In more recent years, the central Japanese bank has been aiming to achieve its 2% inflation target while balancing the economic impacts of the 2020 crisis.\n* Investors who are interested in the Japanese yen can purchase yen ETFs or invest in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.\n\n## Understanding JPY (Japanese Yen)\n\nThe Japanese yen, originally introduced by the Meiji government as a measure to modernize the country economically, is the third-most traded currency in the [foreign exchange market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/foreign-exchange-markets.asp) after the U.S. dollar ([USD](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usd.asp)) and the euro. It is also widely used as a reserve currency after the U.S. dollar, the [euro](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp), and the British pound ([GBP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gbp.asp)). Historically, the yen has been a strong currency due to Japan's strong economy as well; the country's account surplus exporting more goods than it imports had made the country the world's largest creditor nation.\n\nThe word “yen” means “circle” or “round object.” The yen was officially adopted by the Meiji government with the “New Currency Act” of 1871 with the intention of stabilizing the monetary situation. It replaced the mon currency of the Tokugawa era.\n\nThe mon was made mostly of copper. In 1873, silver was devalued, and the yen lost most of its value compared to Canadian and U.S. dollars, both of which had adopted the gold standard. By 1897, the yen was barely worth 50 U.S. cents. That year, Japan also adopted the gold standard, and it became the value of the yen. The sen and the rin were taken out of circulation in 1953.\n\nThe yen was pegged to the U.S. dollar in 1949. When the U.S. went off the [gold standard](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp) in 1971, the yen was devalued again and has been a floating currency since 1973, when the various [oil crises](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1979-energy-crisis.asp) began, rising and falling against the dollar.\n\nIn 1985, the [Plaza Accord](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plaza-accord.asp) agreement was designed amongst the G-5 nations to manipulate exchange rates and depreciate the U.S. dollar in relation to the Japanese yen (as well as the German [Deutsche](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deutschmark.asp#:\\~:text=The%20deutschemark%20%28or%20%22D%2D,was%20DEM%20on%20forex%20markets.) mark). This dramatically increased the value of the yen, essentially doubling the value of the Japanese yen in a span of three years from ¥239 to ¥123 per US$1, between 1985 to 1988.\n\nIn more recent years, the central Japanese bank has been aiming to achieve its 2% inflation target while balancing the economic impacts of the 2020 crisis. In December 2020, it announced it would be spending ¥73.6 trillion to help with the country's recovery.1\n\n## JPY Denominations\n\nThe 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 yen coins are in circulation, which has been the case since 2009. The weight of the 1 yen coin is 1 gram. Banknotes are issued in ¥1,000, ¥2,000, ¥5,000, and ¥10,000 increments. Interestingly, higher yen denominations are counted in multiples of 10.000 while most Western countries count higher denominations by thousands.\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that a few Japanese yen banknotes were getting redesigned, with the new notes expected to begin circulation around 2024.2 The new 10,000 yen note will feature Eiichi Shibusawa, a famous Japanese industrialist in the 19th and early 20th century who is considered the \"father of Japanese capitalism.\"\n\nThe ¥5,000 bill will feature Umeko Tsuda who founded Tsuda University in Tokyo, who pioneered Japanese women's education, and the 1,000 yen note will feature Shibasaburo Kitasato, a scientist who helped push modern medical science forward. The new bills will also feature 3D holograms. The 2,000 yen notes will not get redesigned since there are only a few in circulation. \n \n\n## JPY's Safe Haven Status\n\nThe Japanese yen is considered a [safe haven](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-haven.asp). The currency often appreciates in value during times of economic certainty. When the [Great Recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp) occurred in 2008, the Japanese yen hit a 13-year high of $90.87 against the U.S. dollar and surged nearly 20% that October.3 In 2013, in just one day, the yen rose 5% against the euro and 4% against the dollar because of uncertainty surrounding the Italian elections.\n\nIn addition, there's a belief among traders that in times of uncertainty, Japanese investors are prone to dump foreign holdings and bring their money back in yen, strengthening demand for the currency as well as its valuation.\n\nThe proliferation and popularity of the Japanese yen will continue to keep it a safe haven, a rare currency that appreciates during times of uncertainty. Investors looking to take advantage and diversify their portfolio should look into holding some foreign ETFs and even cash in yen.\n\n### 110.72 Japanese yen\n\n*The current exchange rate per US$1, as of September 24, 2021.*\n\n## Investing in Japanese Yen\n\n* Yen ETFs — Investors can invest in [yen ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yen-etf.asp) that track the relative price of the currency. These ETFs primarily function by investing in yen-backed assets, short-term debt instruments, bonds, and even just holding the spot currency in interest-bearing accounts. Holding yen ETFs can be a good way of diversifying a portfolio in case the currency of an investor's primary country declines in value. More ambitious investors who want to invest in the [Nikkei 225 Stock Average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nikkei.asp)—the Japanese equivalent of the U.S. [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp)—can also do so through an ETF. Some well-known Japanese companies on the Nikkei include Toyota Motor Corp., Mazda Motor Corp., and Sony Corp., among others. ETFs include [Blackrock Japan’s iShares Nikkei 225 ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/jp/individual-en/en/products/251897/ishares-nikkei-225-fund), [Nomura Asset Management’s Nikkei 225 Exchange Traded Fund](https://global.nomura-am.co.jp/nextfunds/information/1321.html) (NTETF), and [Daiwa Asset Management’s Daiwa ETF Nikkei 225](https://www.daiwa-am.co.jp/english/etfs/etf_lineup.html).\n* Forex Trading — The foreign exchange market is also a fast-paced, complicated, and competitive landscape for those that want to trade the yen. Within this space, the yen is notoriously difficult to trade as Japan has a large public debt, aging population, and in the last decade have increasingly run larger deficits. There's a lot of information [forex traders need to know about the yen](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/japanese-yen-what-fx-traders-should-know.asp) before diving in headfirst.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How to Convert Yen to Dollars?\n\nDivide the number of Japanese yen you have by the current exchange rate for the U.S. dollar. As of September 24, 2021, the USD/JPY exchange rate was 110.72. This means that 1 Japanese yen was 0.0090 dollars. For example, US$100 would equal ¥11,072.\n\n### Where Is the Best Place to Buy Japanese Yen?\n\nSome of the best places to buy Japanese yen are at your bank (given it is a large, national bank such as Chase, Bank of America, or Wells Fargo). You can also buy yen at airports, although the exchange rate will not typically work in your favor, as they are up-charged for visitors and tourists that are desperate to convert their dollars.\n\n### What would cause the Japanese Yen to Depreciate?\n\nThe Japanese yen could depreciate based on larger economic concerns, political instability, or the announcement of foreign trade tariffs or other factors.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

I proposed that we need to focus instead on developing IRL value and utility.\n\nLast week, in my essay called *[“Composability Is the Great Value Proposition of Web3”](https://mirror.xyz/0x839846a00f25f01DcB7446A50C92AfB5B24E1b03/vi7mBpeDnQY-fdisHnC4Ei1RohJO3CZLnrSPFA_CPww)*, I delved deeper into one way to bring real-world value to our NFT projects through what I call *decentralized storytelling*, where writing of fiction — whether a novel, a short story, a film or TV show script, or a graphic novel — is not done in isolation but rather done with the fans and community.\n\nToday, I want to explore a little deeper into my project — THE JOE SPUTNIK CHRONICLES — and explain how I see this coming together.\n\n*CAVEAT: this is not the only way to do it, nor the only project that creators should try out these theories. The Sputnik project is merely my way of testing these ideas. Anyone is welcome to join the project and contribute. Or simply track the project and then apply the lessons learned to their own project. If that’s you, please reach out. Let’s build great stories together.*\n\n## A Bit of History\n\nIn 2010, I worked for a large corporation and was editor of a magazine produced quarterly for the employees, vendors, and customers of the company. The company operated in over 150 countries around the world and it was my job to travel to the various locations and write a feature article for each issue about that location.\n\nOn this particular trip, I visited Dubai, UAE and then on to Cairo, Egypt. As I sat in the lobby of my Cairo hotel in probably week three of the trip, I was mentally worn out.\n\nAfter all, I had just completed 19 in-person interviews in a single day. A record I hope I never break!\n\nIt was a rare day off and I was trying to refocus my mind away from work, work, work.\n\nInstead, I began thinking about some of my fiction projects.\n\nAlthough I made my living as a corporate newsletter and magazine writer/editor, my real passion in writing is fiction. I spoken before about the power of story. \n\nAs I sat there mulling things, a character introduced himself.\n\n“My name is Joe Sputnik,” he said inside my mind.\n\nOver the next couple of years, I filled up two composition notebooks with story ideas, notes, character sketches, etc. And I wrote a draft of a hardboiled PI novel that I called *The Butterfly Collector.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/121U9omtLl9dLyBk9SK0X.jpg?height=3024&width=3024)\n\nI only published the novel on my website; never to Amazon and I never submitted it to any publishers for their consideration.\n\nLife got in the way.\n\nFlash forward a dozen years and more than a few other fiction projects:\n\n* *The 64 Testaments of Krill* — a dark fantasy horror novella series, self published on Amazon (under the pen name M. Boris)\n* *The Geriatric Squad* — a superhero spoof movie script\n* *Zombies from Outer Space* — a zombie/alien invasion TV series\n* *The Briny Deep* — a creature feature horror film script\n* *Kilroy Was Here* — a WW2 spy fiction novel (series eventually)\n\nI also built, ran, and eventually sunsetted a small publishing business that republished old, classic, and out-of-print murder mystery stories … amazing shorts, novellas, and novels dating back to the 1890s, up to about 1945.\n\nBut after the Krill series of novellas languished on Amazon, I realized I had tackled the project wrong.\n\n![Book 1 of The 64 Testaments of Krill](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tsx02Wcd4H8xa0F3t7L5U.jpg?height=500&width=309)\n\nI’d written and published seven novellas, then looked up to find my market. And that I’d missed the mark.\n\nGreat stories. I’m proud of them and am confident they can find an audience. Just maybe not on Amazon.\n\nWhat I missed there was building community, and community involvement around that story. And doing so FIRST. Then writing the stories.\n\nIn the 1970s, author Harlan Ellison wrote his novels while sitting in a storefront window. He’d bang out a page on his manual typewriter, then paste it onto the window so that passers-by could read it.\n\nEventually, a crowd would assemble and he could judge his writing *at the moment of creation* by their reactions.\n\nCharles Dickens did much the same. He wrote most of his now required reading books, like *The Pickwick Papers* in serial form, then hawked them to his readers on the street corner.\n\nEach week, he’d get feedback on favorite or hated characters and plot directions. With that, he could adjust his story to suit the tastes and likes of his readers.\n\nBoth of these writers, and many others, wrote with the immediate input of their readers and fans. They wrote within their community, building community (fans) around their work and using the immediate feedback to make better stories. Stories that the fans were hungry for and would buy, then read and get value from.\n\nThis is what I plan to do with my Joe Sputnik saga.\n\n## The Project Outline\n\nI mentioned, above, the original novel that I wrote and completed in 2012.\n\nAs I began to learn about web3 and NFTs, especially for fiction, that story reasserted itself in my memory.\n\n“My story,” Joe told me, “is the perfect setting to explore these wild concepts of decentralization, a blockchain run world, and the promises and problems it may bring.”\n\nThe story was originally set in 2041. For no other reason than the fact that the classic pulp-style hardboiled PI novel was set in 1941 (or so). I’ve shifted the setting slightly for the V2 of the novel to 2047 (25 years from 2022). ’Cause, why not?!\n\nSo the idea was hatched to rewrite the novel from scratch and integrate themes and concepts of blockchain, defi, etc. The skeleton of the plot would not change — who was getting murdered by what psychopath and why my hero, Joe, was pulled against his will into the mystery.\n\nThe rewritten novel, *The Butterfly Collector* v2, will be released in early September as a limited edition NFT.\n\nI am riffing off of the successful *PUNKS Comic* NFT project that ran at the tail end of 2021. You can read their Roadmap and details on their website: <https://punkscomic.com/>.\n\nBut to summarize, they took the popular PUNKS NFT collection and built characters around individual NFTs. Then the team wrote a comic book with those characters.\n\nCuy Sheffield, in his article [“Fantasy Hollywood” — Crypto and Community-Owned Characters](https://future.com/crypto-and-community-owned-characters/) said that this is one way to create what he terms “a character DAO” where the NFT exists and a story is built upon that NFT collection.\n\nBuyers could opt in for either the PDF edition or a print edition. By keeping or burning either copy, they would gain extra benefits, like access to certain vaults with other valuable NFTs contained within.\n\nI don’t have access to these valuable vaults but the concept I’m developing is similar … provide a limited number of ebook (either PDF or more likely ePub and/or Kindle format) novels, plus (or instead of) a high quality, maybe leather bound, gold embossed print edition.\n\nBuy and hodl the ebook, get XYZ.\n\nBuy and hodl the print book, get ABC.\n\nWhat those bonuses are, I do not know yet. One of the things I am hoping for is that my new community will help me develop. But a few ideas:\n\n* access to special collections of NFTs … the classic jpegs of various characters\n* ability to spin off new stories and new characters\n* ability to create new editions (comics, graphic novels, films) of various stories\n\nThe overall idea is to develop a decentralized system for storytelling, using the Joe Sputnik metaverse as the playing field. A fictional metaverse to try stuff and break things. \n\nThis is what Sheffield describes in his article (link above) as “a specific character that already comes with a backstory and identity that inspires the creation of NFTs, but then enables a community of collectors to participate in its evolution.”\n\nBy buying and hodl’ing the various NFTs and/or the soon-to-be-available $SPUTNIK token, you get access to the soon-to-be-build DAO and the stories within.\n\nTo share and trade.\n\nTo build and explore.\n\nWhatever.\n\nAnd the stories themselves remain free (a public good) for anyone who wants to read them. \n\n## The Project Roadmap\n\nI know the term “roadmap” has a bit of a bad connotation at the moment. But this is just a breakdown of what I’m planning. It is subject to change based on reader/fan/supporter input.\n\nThis is a broad overview. With some specific dates. \n\nOn 20 June, I will be opening up a crowdfunding project to raise capital for this project. It will enable me to work on this full time and will enable me to produce the content on the schedule I will outline. It will also enable me to bring on collaborators who can financially benefit from their work as well. \n\nBenefits to crowdfund supporters:\n\n* access to watch me write *live* in my (virtual) storefront window; probably on a Discord channel for lack of a better option (got a better idea? Let me know! Maybe a real store window in the metaverse!)\n* access (in lieu of the above, or in addition) to my “daily pages” … after 25+ years as a professional writer, I write fast and can produce 5,000 words a day (especially if I’m doing this full time) … *this includes the rewrites for v2 of The Butterfly Collector as I don't he page one rewrite!* \n* ability to provide input and story direction as the storyline is developed (both the short stories and the novel\n* early access (I think this is technically possible) to the short story NFT sales so you don’t risk missing out\n\nI don’t care if you contribute 0.10 ETH of 10 ETH. It may dictate the power of your vote (I’m still learning tokenomics) but everyone is invited to hop aboard and help support the project.\n\nThen, on 4 July, the first short story … *[Like A Moth To A Flame](https://mirror.xyz/0x839846a00f25f01DcB7446A50C92AfB5B24E1b03/qW03oE20ZQmD6z8jRUnMBkjpMfplkUoI0IEIE90Txl4)* … will be released as a 1/10 edition NFT. It, and all short stories, will remain free for anyone to read.\n\nIn fact, to get a taste of my writing style and the story, you can go ahead and read this short story at the link above.\n\nAnyone who hodl’s a short story NFT will get:\n\n* early access to future stories\n* opportunity to contribute directly to the stories\n* governance on character decisions, etc.\n\nAdditionally, I will create a very limited print run of the full volume of short stories. I expect to create eight to ten short stories in this series (something akin to a modern TV series with eight to ten episodes in a season).\n\nSo, anyone who buys and hodl’s all ten stories will get a print volume containing all of the stories. Each copy will have its own unique cover artwork and will be numbered, then signed by me as the author.\n\n*This is one of the crucial aspects of the crowdfunding effort … bringing into the community, as a collaborator, an artist who can create custom artwork for these covers, among other artwork.*\n\n*As a long time freelancer myself, I know the struggles of low paying gigs and I DO NOT want to pay a pittance to someone on Fiverr, then profit myself. This is about community and therefore the crowdfund must provide revenue to adequately and ethically compensate an artist.*\n\nSince short story #1 will only ever have a maximum of ten NFT editions available, there will be a maximum of ten of these print volumes available.\n\nI will be releasing a new short story each Monday, starting on July 4 and running through either August 22 or September 5. The end date depends on how many short stories end up in this series; and that is based on feedback from you, my reader and fan.\n\nThe week following the last short story, I will release *The Butterfly Collector, v2* novel NFT.\n\n## I have a few other NFT items in mind\n\nThese include a limited print run of the first draft of my novel. Each of maybe 100 would be printed on my laser printer, bound with heavy card stock, and individually numbered and signed.\n\nLike numbered prints of a famous painting. Genuine and rare.\n\nI also spoke last week in my essay “Composability Is the Great Value Proposition of Web3” about how I see the standard jpeg NFT providing additional utility to hodlrs.\n\nIn summary, each character I create in my stories would have their own jpg NFT. For main characters, like Joe, it would be a 1/1.\n\nFor larger groups, like a bunch of goons who are always getting in Joe’s way (think the armies of kung fu thugs that Jackie Chan periodically fights), they would be semi-rare or even common.\n\n![Everybody was Kung Fu fighting! ](https://c.tenor.com/u546WZi9VRMAAAAM/whirlwind-technique-fight.gif)\n\nIn *The Butterfly Collector*, for example, there is a semi-secret society of women who are known as The Painted Ladies. Each has a unique butterfly tattoo (NFT collection?) as well a delicate tattoo artwork covering their bodies *(story hint: the tattoos tell their individual life story and Joe discovers that they are clues to why someone is murdering these young women)*.\n\nSociety rules dictate that there are only a specific number of Painted Ladies at any given time … a limited edition NFT collection.\n\nThe idea, then, is that anyone can acquire one of, or perhaps a set of, these NFTs. Not a new idea.\n\nBut here is my twist.\n\nWhat if you could buy a set of 1/1 NFTs and play them with your frens like collectable card games, for instance *MAGIC: THE GATHERING* or characters in an RPG game like *Dungeons & Dragons*?\n\nEach character NFT has various hit points or values based on who that character is. Strength and skills in areas like hand-to-hand combat or diplomacy. All characteristics based on what happens in a story. And characteristics that can change based on story.\n\nIf these NFTs were available in packs of ten, none visible to the buyer beforehand, they become like the baseball card collections that you could buy in a cellophane wrapper. You might get a bunch of nobodies or you might get a valuable rookie card. The thrill is in the gamble on what NFTs you might get in the collection.\n\nThen, you can play those against others’ collections to win and build your NFT collections.\n\nWin other’s NFTs. Build war packs. Rule the metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H5Xvtv56E091l-ZcwHhB5.png?height=1920&width=1200)\n\nI’ll be honest … I have no idea how to make this work. At least on a technical side. I need to bring in developers and people who understand how to build/create smart contracts that will manage all of this. Again, the crowdfunding budget includes this and other costs to develop this into a full blown project and DAO, while financially supporting those actively involved.\n\nBut I think it has potential to add a little fun and game play to buying and hodl’ing an NFT.\n\n## The Vision\n\nI have been inspired by the thinking of a lot of other folks. And, maybe because creative thinking is my bread-and-butter, I am finding ways of putting their ideas together into a new form (the “composability” thing I talked about last week). What I'm calling decentalized storytelling. \n\nMy vision is to use the Joe Sputnik story as a testbed for what I’ve talked about with decentralized storytelling. What Cuy Sheffield talked about with character DAOs and open source character IPs. What so many have talked about with the web3 creator economy. \n\n![https://twitter.com/azfnft/status/1536149094216761344?t=lFHBRGoF0N7vfQx-qf6kTA&s=19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m6IPg7FS2QVDZgNJJQRaI.jpg?height=2280&width=1080)\n\nI want to build a collaborative storytelling system where others can tell independent stories within the defined universe/metaverse by minting/staking (not sure of terminology) characters … creators (or *instigators*, as I call them) would have, say, a 35% take in their characters or stories and 65% would go to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe idea being that as a character DAO or a community around the Sputnik metaverse, we build new and amazing stories together.\n\nMaybe someone will come along who is a filmmaker and sees potential in either *The Butterfly Collector* as a film or sees another storyline to pursue. He can, through community voting, become the custodian or instigator of that project.\n\nIf he uses my novel as the basis, I would receive a royalty but, as instigator of the film, he would gain the 35% owner stake. My royalty (or whomever is custodian on the story/character) would be maybe 10% of the 65% that goes into the treasury.\n\nAnd the funds to produce the film would come from the DAO treasury, as well. The producer could petition the DAO for funds to create his project.\n\nOr a graphic novelist could adapt a story. Same process; different media.\n\nThe point is that this is not about me getting rich because I came up with the original idea. The idea is that my original idea is a platform from which multiple avenues of creation can grow.\n\nAnd the community can benefit. Financially and in other ways.\n\nRoles, then, in this vision, would include:\n\n* INSTIGATOR → creates, defines a character or set of characters, or a story/product (novel, comic, movie, etc.); has CUSTODIAL ownership; 2 votes to everyone else’s 1; management/administrative not authority\n* CUSTODIAN → anyone who is responsible for managing a character’s individual IP; may be the INSTIGATOR or be assigned the role at the behest of the INSTIGATOR\n* SUB-INSTIGATOR → upon INSTIGATOR’s approval, instigates a new story based on the character\n\nAnd certainly more.\n\n## However …\n\nI am a creative person. I have an (over) active imagination and can conceive of all manner of strange things. Which is precisely what this “roadmap” is. It is an atlas of the territory and I’ve scribbled all over it with a crayon.\n\nI am also a writer. When I am able to focus on story, without the headaches and time sucks of outside commitments, I can write 5,000 words a day. My record is over 12,000. I can a erage 7 – 9,000 in a day, 6+ days a week. \n\nThe script, *The Briny Deep*, that I mentioned above … from concept to finished draft in 11 days.\n\nMost of the *Testaments of Krill* stories were written in less than a week and average about 27,000 words.\n\nThe story creation and publication I can do. That is like breathing air to me. It is simultaneously the hardest and most wonderful work I can do.\n\nIts the technical aspects that I struggle with. I know Javascript and React. Enough, anyway, to know I’ll never be a developer. Enough to build a basic website and really get in over my head.\n\nThat is one reason I need help. Why I need you.\n\nMaybe you are a developer and can build out the NFT card game I spoke about above.\n\nMaybe you’re an expert at creating and managing DAOs.\n\nMaybe you're that graphic novelist/artist looking for a project.\n\nMaybe you're a filmmaker or TV show producer.\n\nI cannot build this project without help. Without input. Without skills that I do not have.\n\nI am looking to build community around this idea. Community that grows together as we create amazing stories.\n\nNext Monday, 20 June, I will be opening up a crowdfunding effort to raise the capital I need to begin this journey. The funds required to build what may be the first character DAO.\n\n“There is a market for a decentralized version of a “fantasy Hollywood,” too — it just hasn’t been met yet,” said Sheffield in his article.\n\nI aim to make this project the first and make it stand as a shining example of what can be done with storytelling if creatives of all kinds come together to build something together.\n\nI hope you will join me.\n\nNext Monday, I will go deeper into my ideas on decentralized storytelling and how this character DAO process could work. I am meeting with several folks this week to learn more and see how their systems stack up as platforms to use. I will report on what I learn and what I decide to do, initially. I will continue to seek feedback as the project grows.\n\nRight now, with these essays pontificating on my theories, and the short stories, I am taking advantage of the excellent platform Mirror.xyz.\n\nThe crowdfund will also be hosted on Mirror.xyz.\n\nUntil then, follow me on Twitter … @jspi_nft or check out the project on the main website [www.jspi.xyz](https://www.jspi.xyz) (yes, I built it myself using Remix.run … see why I need your help!!?? 😁😜).

{"id": "3DyiP4vaOqbOD11R9oADDQa5fGxZJFFgBdTNcMBV1iI", "title": "Personal Finance", "body": "What Is Personal Finance?\nPersonal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, retirement planning, and tax and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities.\n\nPersonal finance is about meeting personal financial goals, whether it’s having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It all depends on your income, expenses, living requirements, and individual goals and desires—and coming up with a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s important to become financially literate, so you can distinguish between good and bad advice and make smart decisions.\n\nTo learn more about the current state of financial literacy, see the 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nFew schools have courses in how to manage your money, so it is important to learn the basics through free online articles, courses, blogs, podcasts, or at the library.\nSmart personal finance involves developing strategies that include budgeting, creating an emergency fund, paying off debt, using credit cards wisely, saving for retirement, and more.\nBeing disciplined is important, but it’s also good to know when to break the rules—for example, young adults who are told to invest 10% to 20% of their income for retirement may need to take some of those funds to buy a home or pay off debt instead.\nTen Personal Finance Strategies\nThe sooner you start financial planning, the better, but it’s never too late to create financial goals to give yourself and your family financial security and freedom. Here are the best practices and tips for personal finance.\n\n1. Devise a Budget\n   A budget is essential to living within your means and saving enough to meet your long-term goals. The 50/30/20 budgeting method offers a great framework. It breaks down like this:\n\nFifty percent of your take-home pay or net income (after taxes, that is) goes toward living essentials, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and transport.\nThirty percent is allocated to discretionary expenses, such as dining out and shopping for clothes. Giving to charity can go here as well.\nTwenty percent goes toward the future—paying down debt and saving for retirement and emergencies.\nIt’s never been easier to manage money, thanks to a growing number of personal budgeting apps for smartphones that put day-to-day finances in the palm of your hand. Here are just two examples:\n\nYNAB (an acronym for You Need a Budget) helps you track and adjust your spending so that you are in control of every dollar that you spend.1\nMint streamlines cash flow, budgets, credit cards, bills, and investment tracking all from one place. It automatically updates and categorizes your financial data as information comes in, so you always know where you stand financially. The app will even dish out custom tips and advice.2\n2\\. Create an Emergency Fund\nIt’s important to “pay yourself first” to ensure money is set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, a big car repair, day-to-day expenses if you get laid off, and more. Three to six months’ worth of living expenses is the ideal safety net. Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. Once you’ve filled up your emergency fund, don’t stop. Continue funneling the monthly 20% toward other financial goals, such as a retirement fund or a down payment on a home.\n\n1. Limit Debt\n   It sounds simple enough: To keep debt from getting out of hand, don’t spend more than you earn. Of course, most people do have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous—for example, if it leads to acquiring an asset. Taking out a mortgage to buy a house might be one such case. Still, leasing sometimes can be more economical than buying outright, whether you’re renting a property, leasing a car, or even getting a subscription to computer software.\n2. Use Credit Cards Wisely\n   Credit cards can be major debt traps, but it’s unrealistic not to own any in the contemporary world. Furthermore, they have applications beyond buying things. They are not only crucial to establishing your credit rating but also a great way to track spending, which can be a big budgeting aid.\n\nCredit just needs to be managed correctly, which means that you should pay off your full balance every month, or at least keep your credit utilization ratio at a minimum (that is, keep your account balances below 30% of your total available credit). Given the extraordinary rewards incentives offered these days (such as cash back), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible—if you can pay your bills in full. Most important: Avoid maxing out credit cards at all costs, and always pay bills on time. One of the fastest ways to ruin your credit score is to constantly pay bills late—or even worse, miss payments (see tip five).\n\nUsing a debit card, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for accumulated small purchases over an extended period with interest.\n\n1. Monitor Your Credit Score\n   Credit cards are the main vehicle through which your credit score is built and maintained, so watching credit spending goes hand in hand with monitoring your credit score. If you ever want to obtain a lease, mortgage, or any other type of financing, then you’ll need a solid credit report. There are a variety of credit scores available, but the most popular one is the FICO score.3\n\nFactors that determine your FICO score include:4\n\nPayment history (35%)\nAmounts owed (30%)\nLength of credit history (15%)\nCredit mix (10%)\nNew credit (10%)\nFICO scores are calculated from 300 to 850. Here’s how your credit is rated:4\n\nExceptional: 800 to 850\nVery good: 740 to 799\nGood: 670 to 739\nFair: 580 to 669\nVery poor: 300 to 579\nTo pay bills, set up direct debiting where possible (so you never miss a payment) and subscribe to reporting agencies that provide regular credit score updates. By monitoring your credit report, you will be able to detect and address mistakes or fraudulent activity. Federal law allows you to obtain free credit reports once a year from the “Big Three” major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.5\n\nReports can be obtained directly from each agency, or you can sign up at [AnnualCreditReport.com](http://AnnualCreditReport.com), a federally authorized site sponsored by the Big Three.6 You can also get a free credit score from sites such as Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, or WalletHub.789 Some credit card providers, such as Capital One, will provide customers with complimentary, regular credit score updates, but it may not be your FICO score.10 All of the above offer your VantageScore.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the three major credit bureaus are providing free credit reports once a week through at least April 2022.11\n6\\. Consider Your Family\nTo protect the assets in your estate and ensure that your wishes are followed when you die, be sure you make a will and—depending on your needs—possibly set up one or more trusts. You also need to look into insurance: auto, home, life, disability, and long-term care (LTC). Periodically review your policy as well, to make sure it meets your family’s needs through life’s major milestones.\n\nOther critical documents include a living will and a healthcare power of attorney. While not all of these documents directly affect you, all of them can save your next of kin considerable time and expense when you fall ill or become otherwise incapacitated.\n\nAnd while your children are young, take the time to teach them about the value of money and how to save, invest, and spend wisely.\n\n1. Pay Off Student Loans\n   There are myriad loan repayment plans and payment reduction strategies available to graduates. If you’re stuck with a high interest rate, paying off the principal faster can make sense. On the other hand, minimizing repayments (to interest only, for instance) can free up income to invest elsewhere or put into retirement savings while you’re young, when your nest egg will get the maximum benefit from compound interest (see tip eight). Some private and federal loans are even eligible for a rate reduction if the borrower enrolls in auto pay.1213 Flexible federal repayment programs worth checking out include:\n\nGraduated repayment—progressively increases the monthly payment over 10 years\nExtended repayment—stretches out the loan over a period that can be as long as 25 years\nIncome-driven repayment—limits payments to 10% to 20% of your income (based on your income and family size)\n8\\. Plan (and Save) for Retirement\nRetirement may seem like a lifetime away, but it arrives much sooner than you would expect. Experts suggest that most people will need about 80% of their current salary in retirement.14 The younger you start, the more you benefit from what advisors like to call the magic of compounding interest—how small amounts grow over time.\n\nSetting aside money now for your retirement not only allows it to grow over the long term but also can reduce your current income taxes if funds are placed in a tax-advantaged plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA), a 401(k), or a 403(b). If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, start paying into it right away, especially if your employer matches your contribution. By not doing so, you’re giving up free money. Take time to learn the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) if your company offers both.\n\nInvesting is only one part of planning for retirement. Other strategies include waiting as long as possible before opting to receive Social Security benefits (which is smart for most people) and converting a term life insurance policy to permanent life.\n\n1. Maximize Tax Breaks\n   Due to an overly complex tax code, many individuals leave hundreds or even thousands of dollars sitting on the table every year. By maximizing your tax savings, you’ll free up money that can be invested in your reduction of past debts, enjoyment of the present, and plans for the future.\n\nYou need to start each year saving receipts and tracking expenditures for all possible tax deductions and tax credits. Many office supply stores sell helpful “tax organizers” that have the main categories already labeled. After you’re organized, you’ll want to focus on taking advantage of every tax deduction and credit available, as well as deciding between the two when necessary. In short, a tax deduction reduces the amount of income on which you are taxed, whereas a tax credit actually reduces the amount of tax that you owe. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will save you much more than a $1,000 deduction.\n\n1. Give Yourself a Break\n   Budgeting and planning can seem full of deprivations. Make sure you reward yourself now and then. Whether it’s a vacation, a purchase, or an occasional night on the town, you need to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Doing so gives you a taste of the financial independence for which you’re working so hard.\n\nLast but not least, don’t forget to delegate when needed. Even though you might be competent enough to do your own taxes or manage a portfolio of individual stocks, it doesn’t mean you should. Setting up an account at a brokerage and spending a few hundred dollars on a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner—at least once—might be a good way to jump-start your planning.\n\nThree key character traits can help you avoid innumerable mistakes in managing your personal finances: discipline, a sense of timing, and emotional detachment.\nPersonal Finance Principles\nOnce you’ve established some fundamental procedures, you can start thinking about philosophy. The key to getting your finances on the right track isn’t learning a new set of skills. Rather, it’s about understanding that the principles that contribute to success in business and your career work just as well in personal money management. The three key principles are prioritization, assessment, and restraint.\n\nPrioritization—This means that you’re able to look at your finances, discern what keeps the money flowing in, and make sure that you stay focused on those efforts.\nAssessment—This is the key skill that keeps professionals from spreading themselves too thin. Ambitious individuals always have a list of ideas about other ways that they can hit it big, whether it is a side business or an investment idea. While there is absolutely a place and time for taking a flyer, running your finances like a business means stepping back and honestly assessing the potential costs and benefits of any new venture.\nRestraint—This is that final big-picture skill of successful business management that must be applied to personal finances. Time and again, financial planners sit down with successful people who somehow still manage to spend more than they make. Earning $250,000 a year won’t do you much good if you spend $275,000 annually. Learning to restrain spending on non-wealth-building assets until after you’ve met your monthly savings or debt reduction goals is crucial in building net worth.\nLearn About Personal Finance\nFew schools offer courses in managing your money, which means that most of us will need to get our personal finance education from our parents (if we’re lucky) or pick it up ourselves. Fortunately, you don’t have to spend much money to find out how to better manage it. You can learn everything you need to know for free online and in library books. Almost all media publications regularly dole out personal finance advice, too.\n\nOnline Blogs\nA great way to start learning about personal finance is to read personal finance blogs. Instead of the general advice you’ll get in personal finance articles, you’ll learn exactly which challenges real people are facing and how they are addressing those challenges.\n\nMr. Money Mustache has hundreds of posts full of irreverent insights on how to escape the rat race and retire extremely early by making unconventional lifestyle choices.15 CentSai helps you navigate myriad financial decisions via first-person accounts.16 Million Mile Secrets and The Points Guy each teach you how to travel for a fraction of the retail price by using credit card rewards.1718 These sites often link to other blogs, so you’ll discover more sites as you read.\n\nOf course, we can’t help tooting our own horn in this category. Investopedia offers a wealth of free personal finance education. You might start with our special sections on budgeting, buying a home, and planning for retirement—or the thousands of other articles in our personal finance section. And don’t forget to listen to “The Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver,” our weekly podcast, and sign up for Investopedia newsletters.\n\nAt the Library\nYou may need to visit your library in person to get a library card if you don’t already have one, but after that, you can check out personal finance audiobooks and e-books online without leaving home. Some of the following best sellers may be available from your local library: I Will Teach You to Be Rich, The Millionaire Next Door, Your Money or Your Life, and Rich Dad Poor Dad. Personal finance classics such as Personal Finance for Dummies, The Total Money Makeover, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, and Think and Grow Rich are also available as audiobooks.\n\nFree Online Classes\nIf you enjoy the structure of lessons and quizzes, try one of these free digital personal finance courses:\n\nMorningstar Investing Classroom offers a place for beginning and experienced investors alike to learn about stocks, funds, bonds, and portfolios. Some of the courses you’ll find include “Stocks Versus Other Investments,” “Methods for Investing in Mutual Funds,” “Determining Your Asset Mix,” and “Introduction to Government Bonds.” Each course takes about 10 minutes and is followed by a quiz to help you make sure that you understood the lesson.19\nEdX is an online learning platform created by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.20 It offers at least three courses that cover personal finance: “How to Save Money: Making Smart Financial Decisions” from the University of California at Berkeley, “Personal Finance” from Purdue University, and “Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making” from the University of Michigan. These courses will teach you things such as how credit works, which types of insurance you might want to carry, how to maximize your retirement savings, how to read your credit report, and what the time value of money is.212223\n“Planning for a Secure Retirement” is an online course from Purdue University. It’s broken up into 10 main modules, and each has four to six sub-modules on topics such as Social Security, 401(k) and 403(b) plans, and IRAs. You’ll learn about your risk tolerance, think about what kind of retirement lifestyle you want, and estimate your retirement expenses.24\n“Personal Finance” is a free online video course from Missouri State University through iTunes. This basic course is good for beginners who want to learn about personal financial statements and budgets, how to use consumer credit wisely, and how to make decisions about cars and housing.25\nPodcasts\nPersonal finance podcasts are a great way to learn how to manage your money if you’re short on free time. While you’re getting ready in the morning, exercising, driving to work, running errands, or preparing for bed, you can listen to expert advice on becoming more financially secure. In addition to “The Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver,” you may find these valuable:\n\n“The Dave Ramsey Show” is a call-in program that you can listen to anytime through your favorite podcast app. You’ll learn about the financial problems that real people are facing and how a multimillionaire who was once broke himself recommends solving them.26\n“Freakonomics Radio” and NPR’s “Planet Money” both make economics interesting by using it to explain real-world phenomena such as “how we got from mealy, nasty apples to apples that actually taste delicious,” the Wells Fargo fake-accounts scandal, and whether we should still be using cash.2728\nAmerican Public Media’s “Marketplace” helps make sense of what’s going on in the business world and the economy.29\n“So Money with Farnoosh Torabi” combines interviews with successful business people, expert advice, and listeners’ personal finance questions.30\nThe most important thing is to find resources that work for your learning style and that you find interesting and engaging. If one blog, book, course, or podcast is dull or difficult to understand, keep trying until you find something that clicks.\n\nEducation shouldn’t stop once you learn the basics. The economy changes, and new financial tools—such as the budgeting apps mentioned earlier—are always being developed. Find resources that you enjoy and trust, and keep refining your money skills from now to retirement and even after.\n\nThings That Classes Can’t Teach You\nPersonal finance education is a great idea for consumers, especially people starting out, who need to learn investing basics or credit management. However, understanding the basic concepts is not a guaranteed path to fiscal sense. Human nature can often derail the best of intentions aimed at achieving a perfect credit score or building a substantial retirement nest egg. These three key character traits can help you stay on track:\n\nDiscipline\nOne of the most important tenets of personal finance is systematic saving. Say your net earnings are $60,000 per year and your monthly living expenses—housing, food, transportation, and the like—amount to $3,200 per month. There are choices to make surrounding your remaining $1,800 in monthly salary. Ideally, the first step is to establish an emergency fund or perhaps a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA)—to be eligible for one, your health insurance must be a high-deductible health plan (HDHP)—to meet out-of-pocket medical expenses. Let’s say that your friends like to go out several times a week, eating away at your spare cash. Lacking the discipline required to save rather than spend could keep you from saving the 10% to 15% of gross income that could have been stashed in a money market account for short-term needs.\n\nThen, once you have your emergency stash, there’s investing discipline; it’s not just for institutional money managers who make their living by buying and selling stocks. The average investor would do well to set a target on profit taking and abide by it. As an example, imagine that you bought Apple Inc. stock in February 2016 at $93 and vowed to sell when it crossed $110, as it did two months later. Alas, when it did, you broke that vow and held on to the stock. It went back down, and you ended up exiting the position in July 2016 at $97, giving up gains of $13 per share and the possible opportunity for profit from another investment.\n\nA Sense of Timing\nThree years out of college, you’ve established the emergency fund, and it is time to reward yourself. A Jet Ski costs $3,000. Investing in growth stocks can wait another year, you think; there is plenty of time to launch an investment portfolio, right? However, putting off investing for one year can have significant consequences. The opportunity cost of buying the personal watercraft can be illustrated through the aforementioned time value of money. The $3,000 used to buy the Jet Ski would have amounted to nearly $49,000 in 40 years at 7% interest, a reasonable average annual return for a growth mutual fund over the long haul. Thus, delaying the decision to invest wisely may likewise delay the ability to reach your goal of retiring at age 62.\n\nDoing tomorrow what you could do today also extends to debt payment. A $3,000 credit card balance takes 222 months (that’s 18.5 years) to retire if the minimum payment of $75 is made each month. And don’t forget the interest that you’re paying: At an 18% annual percentage rate (APR), it comes to $3,923 over those months. Plunking down $3,000 to erase the balance in the current month offers substantial savings—nearly $1,000 over the cost of the Jet Ski.\n\nEmotional Detachment\nPersonal finance matters are business, and business should not be personal. A difficult, but necessary, facet of sound financial decision-making involves removing the emotion from a transaction. Making impulsive purchases feels good but can have a big impact on long-term investment goals. So can making unwise loans to family members. Your cousin Fred, who has already burned your brother and sister, will likely not pay you back, either—so the smart answer is to decline his requests for help. The key to prudent personal financial management is to separate feelings from reason. By the way, this should not keep you from making seriously needed loans—or even gifts—to help out, especially in times of real trouble. Just try not to take it out of your savings and investment fund.\n\nBreaking Personal Finance Rules\nThe personal finance realm may have more guidelines and smart tips to follow than any other. Although these rules are good to know about, everyone has individual circumstances. Here are some rules that prudent people, especially young adults, are never supposed to break—but should consider breaking anyway:\n\nSaving or Investing a Set Portion of Your Income\nAn ideal budget includes saving a portion of your paycheck every month for retirement—usually around 10% to 20%. While being fiscally responsible is important and thinking about your future is crucial, the general rule of saving a given amount each period for your retirement may not always be the best choice, especially for young people just getting started in the real world. For one thing, many young adults and students need to think about paying for the biggest expenses of their lifetime, such as a new car, home, or postsecondary education. Taking away potentially 10% to 20% of available funds would be a definite setback in making those purchases.\n\nAdditionally, saving for retirement doesn’t make a whole lot of sense if you have credit cards or interest-bearing loans to pay off. The 19% interest rate on your Visa card probably would negate the returns that you get from your balanced mutual fund retirement portfolio five times over.\n\nFinally, saving some money to travel and experience new places and cultures can be especially rewarding for a young person who’s still not sure about their path in life.\n\nLong-term Investing/Investing in Riskier Assets\nThe rule of thumb for young investors is that they should have a long-term outlook and stick to a buy-and-hold philosophy. This rule is one of the easier ones to justify breaking. Being able to adapt to changing markets can be the difference between making money or limiting your losses and sitting idly by and watching your hard-earned savings shrink. Short-term investing has its advantages at any age.\n\nNow, if you’re no longer married to the idea of long-term investing, you can stick to safer investments as well. The logic was that as young investors have such a long investment time horizon, they should be investing in higher-risk ventures; after all, they have the rest of their lives to recover from any losses that they may suffer. However, you don’t have to take on undue risk in your short- to medium-term investments if you don’t want to. The idea of diversification is an important part of creating a strong investment portfolio; this includes both the riskiness of individual stocks and their intended investment horizon.\n\nAt the other end of the age spectrum, investors near and at retirement are encouraged to cut back to the safest investments—even though these may yield less than inflation—to preserve capital. It’s important to take fewer risks as the number of years that you have to earn money and recover from bad financial times dwindles, but at age 60 or 65, you could have 20, 30, or even more years to go. Some growth investments could still make sense for you.\n\nWhat resources are there for learning about personal finance?\nThere are many, starting with books and e-books from your public library, which should be free. Also, you can listen to podcasts, read popular finance blogs online, and enroll in free online classes. Make sure to choose books, blogs, podcasts, or courses that engage you, so that you’ll stick with them and learn.\n\nWhat personal qualities are helpful in managing your money?\nIt takes discipline to set aside money for retirement over the years, get yourself out of debt, and avoid overspending. In addition, taking care of your finances when they need to be addressed can help you meet your goals over time. And having some emotional detachment is useful in staying focused and avoiding indulging every relative’s request for a bailout.\n\nWhat’s a smart way to set up a budget?\nOne method to consider is the 50/30/20 budgeting rule. Fifty percent of your income should go toward essential living expenses—rent/mortgage, food, utilities, and the like.

{"id": "AJKj-2Qap3D-ZTjnLp0HCu_fnIQcNAvYyb4aCLs0oGI", "title": "Jurisdiction Risk", "body": "## What Is Jurisdiction Risk?\n\nJurisdiction risk refers to the risks that can arise when operating in a foreign country or jurisdiction. These risks can arise simply by doing business, or else by lending or borrowing money in another country. Risks could also stem from legal, regulatory, or political factors that exist in different countries or regions.\n\nIn recent times, jurisdiction risk has focused increasingly on banks and financial institutions that are exposed to the volatility that some of the countries where they operate may be high-risk areas for money laundering and terrorism financing.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Jurisdiction risk is associated with operating in a foreign country or region.\n* Jurisdiction risk can also be applied to times when an investor is exposed to unexpected changes in the laws.\n* The U.S. government advises financial institutions to refer to updates from the Financial Action Task Force to identify potentially risky jurisdictions with weak measures to fight money laundering and terrorist financing.2\n\n## How Jurisdiction Risk Works\n\nJurisdiction risk is any additional risk that arises from borrowing and lending or doing business in a foreign country. This risk can also refer to times when laws unexpectedly change in an area in which an investor has exposure. This type of jurisdiction risk can often lead to added price volatility. As a result, the added risk from volatility means investors will demand higher returns to offset the higher levels of risk being faced.\n\n[Political risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/politicalrisk.asp) is a form of jurisdiction risk whereby an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting [investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp) returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers, or military control.\n\nSome of the risks associated with jurisdiction risk that banks, investors, and companies may face include [legal complications](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/litigation-risk.asp), [exchange rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp) risks, and even [geopolitical risks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/politicalrisk.asp).\n\nAs mentioned above, jurisdiction risk has recently become synonymous with countries where money laundering and terrorist activities are high. These activities are generally believed to be prevalent in countries that are designated as non-cooperative by the [Financial Action Task Force](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-action-task-force-fatf.asp) (FATF) or are identified by the [U.S. Treasury](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp) as requiring special measures due to concerns about money laundering or corruption.34 Because of the punitive fines and penalties that can be levied against a financial institution that is involved—even inadvertently—in money laundering or financing terrorism, most organizations have specific processes to assess and mitigate jurisdiction risk.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nThe FATF publishes two documents publicly three times a year and has done so since 2000. These reports identify areas of the world that the FATF declares have weak efforts to combat both money laundering and terrorist financing. These countries are called Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs).4\n\nAs of June 2021, the FATF listed the following 22 countries as monitored jurisdictions: Albania, Barbados, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cayman Islands, Haiti, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, Morocco, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.5 These NCCTs have deficiencies when it comes to placing [anti-money laundering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp) policies, as well as recognizing and fighting terrorist financing. But they have all committed to working with the FATF to address the deficiencies.\n\nThe FATF placed both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (i.e., North Korea) and Iran on its call-to-action list. According to the FATF, North Korea still poses a great risk to international finance because of its lack of commitment and deficiencies in the noted areas. The FATF also indicated its concern over the country's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The organization noted Iran outlined its commitment to the FATF but has failed to enact its plan.61\n\n## Examples of Jurisdiction Risk\n\nInvestors may experience jurisdiction risk in the form of [foreign exchange risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreignexchangerisk.asp) (also known as currency risk). So, an international financial transaction may be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange. This can lead to a drop in the value of an investment. Foreign exchange risks can be mitigated by using hedging strategies including options and forward contracts.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

Hosted by CoinDesk, the most influential and trusted platform for the digital world, Consensus is the world’s biggest and longest-running crypto festival.\n\nConsensus will ignite hard-hitting conversations, spark critical debates, and host one-of-a-kind experiences for how these technologies and communities are remaking the worlds of finance, investing, culture, entertainment, marketing, governance and more. Thousands of the world's brightest minds and influential voices will be in Austin, Texas, and look forward to the days ahead with events and parties!\n\nConsensus has been recognized as the most influential event in the cryptocurrency and blockchain field since 2015. Consensus will bring together thousands of attendees to hear from the most popular thought leaders and experience a wide range of keynote presentations, exclusive panels, workshops and networking opportunities. This event will be centered at the Austin Convention Center, while other locations throughout the city will host a variety of additional programming organizations from CoinDesk, the World Economic Forum, coin Center, and other partners.\n\nIn recent years, non-fungible tokens (NFT), metaverse and the possibility and adoption of decentralization are exploding. The\n\n \n spread of the COVID-19 has caused most of us to stay behind closed doors. Many promise to create a way for artists and creators to bypass brokers, agents and other middlemen to find audiences and earn financial rewards. If you are a creator, the content of Consensus 2022 should be studied and considered in order to understand the latest ideas and innovation mechanisms for creative entrepreneurship.\n\nIn addition, Consensus 2022 has introduced a virtual pass option to enjoy the atmosphere anytime, anywhere with it. Consensus 2022 Live, presented by Bitget, allows you to listen from industry leaders to explore all aspects of crypto market, blockchain, Web 3 and metaverse.\n\nThe virtual pass will stream from the official Consensus website and mobile app, featuring content from all Consensus stages. Livestreaming begins on Thursday, June 9, and ends at the close of Consensus on Sunday, June 12. It will be available for 30 days following the event. Existing IRL Consensus passholders will also have access to these streams.\n\nHowever, virtual pass holders will not be able to collect or use DESK and will not be able to view parties, happy hours or live music. All C22 pass holders can view the livestream from the Consensus Official App or online through the Consensus agenda.\n\nThe complex choreography of wallet identity checks and payment exchanges will keep CoinDesk's social token DESK circulating among an expected crowd of more than 15,000 attendees when Consensus 2022 starts on Thursday\n\n \n \"This is probably the biggest test in crypto media to date.”Jenil Thakker, CEO of Coinvise, a startup that builds tokenization and community experiences for brands including CoinDesk said. “No organization of CoinDesk's scale has ever done this before.”\n\nCoinDesk is relaunching DESK for this year's Consensus,which is the first face-to-face meeting of this media and events company since 2019. It aims to bring conference attendees proficient in cryptocurrency closer to the brand while also getting a hands-on experience with the technology.\n\nCoinDesk's value proposition to DESK holders is similar to the Disney dollar: it's valuable in the brand ecosystem, but worthless anywhere else. Like air miles, it rewards loyal users in a different way to earn internal perks. Unlike air miles, it exists on a public blockchain. The transaction is irreversible and beyond the issuer's control. CoinDesk itself sees DESK as a high stake. It implies the potential integration inside and outside the site in the future. For now, of course, the focus is Consensus 2022.\n\nWhether you are a crypto beginner or an expert, Consensus will bring you the best experience.

{"id": "nSUqXB8cWIszc02vPZRLz3ZIhEiOyK6jpbEBj0fcXe4", "title": "Just in Case (JIC)", "body": "## What Is Just in Case (JIC)?\n\nJust in case (JIC) is an inventory strategy where companies keep large inventories on hand. This type of [inventory management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory-management.asp) strategy aims to minimize the probability that a product will sell out of stock. A company that uses this strategy typically has difficulty predicting consumer demand or experiences large surges in demand at unpredictable times. A company practicing this strategy essentially incurs higher inventory [holding costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holding-costs.asp) in return for a reduction in the number of sales lost due to sold-out inventory.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS:\n\n* Just in case (JIC) is an inventory strategy where companies keep large inventories on hand.\n* This strategy minimizes the probability that a product will sell out of stock.\n* A company that uses this strategy typically has difficulty predicting consumer demand or experiences large surges in demand at unpredictable times.\n* The main disadvantage of this strategy is higher storage costs and wasted inventory if all stock does not sell.\n\n## How Just in Case (JIC) Works\n\nThe JIC inventory strategy differs from the more recent \"[just in time](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp)\" (JIT) inventory strategy, where companies try to minimize inventory costs by producing the goods after the orders have come in.\n\nThe JIC strategy is more common in less industrialized countries where poor transportation infrastructure, natural disasters, poor quality control, and vulnerability to other suppliers' production problems are concerns. Such instabilities in the supply chain could lead to costly production inefficiencies. Therefore, a manufacturer may decide to pay for excess inventory to avoid production shutdowns.\n\nFor JIC, manufacturers reorder stock before it reaches the minimum level to continue to sell inventory while the suppliers are supplying the goods. The time from when the firm reorders the stock to the time the supplier provides the new stock is known as lead time. A JIC inventory system tries to keep a minimum level of inventory in case of emergencies. JIC is typically more costly than JIT because it can lead to waste if not all of the inventory is sold and there are additional storage costs due to the additional inventory.\n\n### Why Choose the More Costly JIC Strategy?\n\nOne major reason for practicing a more costly JIC system is the potential losses, such as permanent loss of major customers, loss of suppliers, and supply-chain collapse. If the JIT response contingencies are too slow or fail to keep production flowing, additional costs may be incurred. The additional costs due to maintaining extra storage and resources may be more cost effective than using a more efficient JIT system.\n\nIn a recent turn of events, some companies have started understocking their inventories on purpose. Makers of particular popular items for which buyers are not willing to accept substitutes can use this strategy.\n\nThe \"just in case\" strategy is used by companies that have trouble [forecasting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forecasting.asp) demand. With this strategy, the companies have enough production material on hand to meet unexpected [spikes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spike.asp) in demand. Higher storage costs are the main disadvantage of this strategy.\n\n## Real World Examples of Just In Case (JIC)\n\nAn example of JIC buyers are the military or hospitals. These types of organizations must maintain large inventories because waiting for JIT producers to ramp up production for needed supplies may result in lost lives and even wars.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstePsEhoewNhEEkSiFHfRG3zDcEOMA9P1LWBArgS8l165r28SSnfEbcttr3-yyF8VjtlQFT_RgXMMyYSJID1EL_Vfd_Z8qJs5fGP38BFA35LPNurimeH2paNzcpNZy16cWw3JN0UbdNqRbWIk_kR-7oKbctZ6YyVI8gT6fhbtGFCdNGLY9TXZTi-dZl9gWI8JtcRN0CS_xfh-qLioM-wZ9oIYSWmMAI2gSjhs4ck_1GJECv2HzHJg_XDofSvuLAo9YMJYeq8al9YrSFZpQ8hYxiEMQc3P5OTMqe2agyqBaN5TAGVn1gDZMVJlZd64xzNYeo5qEsilvhLzdKWWYOjnuGr4_Bt-UmxaRQbFfNger4JjzKfDNPA7cMkg&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMZvjFo9JSL6EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstePsEhoewNhEEkSiFHfRG3zDcEOMA9P1LWBArgS8l165r28SSnfEbcttr3-yyF8VjtlQFT_RgXMMyYSJID1EL_Vfd_Z8qJs5fGP38BFA35LPNurimeH2paNzcpNZy16cWw3JN0UbdNqRbWIk_kR-7oKbctZ6YyVI8gT6fhbtGFCdNGLY9TXZTi-dZl9gWI8JtcRN0CS_xfh-qLioM-wZ9oIYSWmMAI2gSjhs4ck_1GJECv2HzHJg_XDofSvuLAo9YMJYeq8al9YrSFZpQ8hYxiEMQc3P5OTMqe2agyqBaN5TAGVn1gDZMVJlZd64xzNYeo5qEsilvhLzdKWWYOjnuGr4_Bt-UmxaRQbFfNger4JjzKfDNPA7cMkg&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMZvjFo9JSL6EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

Many cool creative projects are coming soon, so stay tuned for official news!\n\nLet's learn about Darewise.\n\nDarewise is an independent video game startup studio based in Paris, France. Founded in 2018 by AAA industry veterans, it has rapidly grown into a europe-wide team of more than 40 international talent. Darewise has partnered with Concept Art House (CAH), a leading publisher for some of the world's most recognizable NFTs and video game art to create an NFT collection with powerful in-game utility for Life Beyond. Named DRAP (D.E.E.P. Robot Autonomous Pet), the unique NFT will provide exclusive owner benefits inside and outside of the game.\n\nDarewise's vision has always been to create the next generation of high-quality online multiplayer games where players can find their community, make social connections and experience adventures that resonate thematically with the real world.\n\n\"This collaboration is another testament to our dedication to pioneering AAA gaming on Web3. Long before the Web 3 era, Concept Art House has been a reference in the creation of outstanding artworks for the games industry and was among the first ones to craft high quality NFTs, both from a visual standpoint and\n\n \n utility design. We cannot wait for the more than 1M NFT owners who participated in our first airdrop to see the amazing NFT collection Concept Art House is creating for them as well as new players wanting to explore Life Beyond,\" said Benjamin Charbit, Co-Founder and CEO of Darewise Entertainment.\n\n\"It's truly astonishing how rapidly NFTs have been immersed into the gaming and Web 3 experience and what Darewise is creating with Life Beyond is going to propel this interactivity to a whole new level,\" said James Zhang, CEO of Concept Art House.\n\nLife Beyond is one of the first true AAA video games powered by the potent mix of Unreal Engine 5 and web3 technology. An Open Alpha is set for early Summer 2022. In Life Beyond, players will experience a fast-paced and ever-evolving modern persistent free-to-play massively multiplayer game set on an alien world. They will be tasked with exploring a strange new world, battling antagonistic forces all while having to create and foster a new society in which social behaviors and technology will determine success.\n\nLife Beyond's guiding principles are fast and exciting gameplay, true ownership of digital assets, a player-driven social in-game economy, and decentralized governance. The game's mission is to empower players to make decisions both on an individual level via their own play choices as well as collectively by making critical decisions on the future direction of the game. Society will evolve according to the choices, user generated creations, and the behaviors of its players.\n\n \n The D.E.E.P. Robot Autonomous Pet is a mix of a PFP (profile pic) and an in-game pet project. Each DRAP will be unique, featuring different traits with varying rarity levels. In Life Beyond, a DRAP will perform certain actions for its owner. However, keep in mind that there is only a limited amount of DRAPs that the D.E.E.P. Agency was able to bring with them during their first trip to Dolos (the alien planet in Life Beyond).\n\nDRAP NFTs will come with out-of-game utility, such as providing holders with a mintpass for public sales of Land, special airdrops, and access to community events. More details including availability will be announced soon. At the same time, Darewise is about connecting people to people, and they are passionate about making ambitious online games that can safely accommodate multiplayers. Their mission is to create less violent, more meaningful experiences that bring people together in social entertainment spaces and live their online lives in shared virtual worlds.\n\nDarewise's friendly, device-neutral games are designed to be accessible to all. It provides a space where highly skilled, experienced players and beginners can coexist harmoniously. They easily fit into our players' schedules and allow for short matches or hour-long matches. Darewise not only promotes the positive power of video games to create and foster deep and lasting friendships, they also believe they are simply exploring the possibilities of this medium and invite all players to explore and build together.\n\nConcept Art House is delighted to have partnered with\n\nDarewise Entertainment. We are amazed at it’s professionalism and impressed by the spirit of the game.

{"id": "PxTYzu0X1RffEj6Wn2-Ic1CABUiEwCacFssjj-tJIQU", "title": "Porter's 5 Forces", "body": "What Are Porter's Five Forces?\nPorter's Five Forces is a model that identifies and analyzes five competitive forces that shape every industry and helps determine an industry's weaknesses and strengths. Five Forces analysis is frequently used to identify an industry's structure to determine corporate strategy. Porter's model can be applied to any segment of the economy to understand the level of competition within the industry and enhance a company's long-term profitability. The Five Forces model is named after Harvard Business School professor, Michael E. Porter.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nPorter's Five Forces is a framework for analyzing a company's competitive environment.\nThe number and power of a company's competitive rivals, potential new market entrants, suppliers, customers, and substitute products influence a company's profitability.\nFive Forces analysis can be used to guide business strategy to increase competitive advantage.\n1:44\nPorter's Five Forces\nUnderstanding Porter's Five Forces\nPorter's Five Forces is a business analysis model that helps to explain why various industries are able to sustain different levels of profitability. The model was published in Michael E. Porter's book, \"Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors\" in 1980.1 The Five Forces model is widely used to analyze the industry structure of a company as well as its corporate strategy. Porter identified five undeniable forces that play a part in shaping every market and industry in the world, with some caveats. The five forces are frequently used to measure competition intensity, attractiveness, and profitability of an industry or market.\n\nPorter's five forces are:\n\n1. Competition in the industry\n2. Potential of new entrants into the industry\n3. Power of suppliers\n4. Power of customers\n5. Threat of substitute products1\n\nWhat if you had started investing years ago?\nFind out what a hypothetical investment would be worth today.\n\nSELECT A STOCK\n\nTSLA\nTESLA INC\n\nAAPL\nAPPLE INC\n\nNKE\nNIKE INC\n\nAMZN\n[AMAZON.COM](http://AMAZON.COM), INC\n\nWMT\nWALMART INC\nSELECT INVESTMENT AMOUNT\n$\n1,000\nSELECT A PURCHASE DATE\n\n5 years ago\nCALCULATE\nCompetition in the Industry\nThe first of the five forces refers to the number of competitors and their ability to undercut a company. The larger the number of competitors, along with the number of equivalent products and services they offer, the lesser the power of a company. Suppliers and buyers seek out a company's competition if they are able to offer a better deal or lower prices. Conversely, when competitive rivalry is low, a company has greater power to charge higher prices and set the terms of deals to achieve higher sales and profits.\n\nPotential of New Entrants Into an Industry\nA company's power is also affected by the force of new entrants into its market. The less time and money it costs for a competitor to enter a company's market and be an effective competitor, the more an established company's position could be significantly weakened. An industry with strong barriers to entry is ideal for existing companies within that industry since the company would be able to charge higher prices and negotiate better terms.\n\nPower of Suppliers\nThe next factor in the five forces model addresses how easily suppliers can drive up the cost of inputs. It is affected by the number of suppliers of key inputs of a good or service, how unique these inputs are, and how much it would cost a company to switch to another supplier. The fewer suppliers to an industry, the more a company would depend on a supplier. As a result, the supplier has more power and can drive up input costs and push for other advantages in trade. On the other hand, when there are many suppliers or low switching costs between rival suppliers, a company can keep its input costs lower and enhance its profits.\n\nPower of Customers\nThe ability that customers have to drive prices lower or their level of power is one of the five forces. It is affected by how many buyers or customers a company has, how significant each customer is, and how much it would cost a company to find new customers or markets for its output. A smaller and more powerful client base means that each customer has more power to negotiate for lower prices and better deals. A company that has many, smaller, independent customers will have an easier time charging higher prices to increase profitability.\n\nThe Five Forces model can help businesses boost profits, but they must continuously monitor any changes in the five forces and adjust their business strategy.\nThreat of Substitutes\nThe last of the five forces focuses on substitutes. Substitute goods or services that can be used in place of a company's products or services pose a threat. Companies that produce goods or services for which there are no close substitutes will have more power to increase prices and lock in favorable terms. When close substitutes are available, customers will have the option to forgo buying a company's product, and a company's power can be weakened.\n\nUnderstanding Porter's Five Forces and how they apply to an industry, can enable a company to adjust its business strategy to better use its resources to generate higher earnings for its investors.", "timestamp": 1655170992, "digest": "1O3L9YzVN2pgVJUSObP1PYja1D5dNMtmmCU637asG_M", "contributor": "0xF17EA66eE519b2E871db6af203b0C8182C115da5"}

In 2012, we had more than 120 top game projects worldwide on three quarters of iOS and PlayStation. Today, we have more than 160 projects worldwide, covering 95% of Web3 and open metaverse!\n\nLet's take a look back at the years of Concept Art House.\n\nSince 2007, Concept Art House (CAH) has provided art and support for many of the top gaming and entertainment companies in the world and has shipped over 1000 games and collectibles with the world's most influential brands. With those deep roots in gaming, including franchises such as ROBLOX and Fortnite, CAH has evolved to focus solely on NFTs and has successfully pivoted to play a major role in the creation of Web3 and the metaverse ecosystem. To that end, CAH has created NFTs for Frank Miller's Sin City, UFC, International Olympics Committee (IOC), the NFL and Gucci. CAH is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Shanghai and Chengdu and its partners and investors include Dapper Labs, Gala Games and Animoca Brands.\n\nAs our founder and CEO, James Zhang is also the soul of our team. In addition to being an entrepreneur, he has worked as an executive of world-renowned companies, an artist and a developer. With over 20 years of rich experience, he has led our team to today with a forward-looking vision.\n\nWhat’s more, there are other outstanding team members include Jenny Chen, the Vice Chair of SFOX and adviser to Warburg Pincus. Many others with years of experience in the crypto or art fields are working with us.\n\nConcept Art House is the world's first true NFT publisher, and we are bridging the gap between digital equity brands and fans who love\n\nNFT. When AAA works of art enter the NFT market, it will destroy the value of the IP itself if given to a low-quality team. As a professional NFT production team, all the works produced so far are AAA level, and the team understands the innovative use of NFT, and also has a good understanding of game development due to the cooperation with game companies for more than ten years. At the same time, we also have our loyal fans in the community, who recognize the high quality of NFT produced by us. We will let our fans know more worthwhile and durable NFT through the regular release of articles.\n\nAs the name suggests, Concept Art House is a major supplier of high-quality concept design, which is a process of continuous evolution from scratch before the finished product is presented. For example, the original game art, story set, character set, these are part of the concept design. The ultimate goal is to present a complete world value in the work.\n\nEvery initial idea handed to Concept Art House goes through thinking, composition, discussion, selection, decision, implementation and modification. Together with many brands, they witness the birth of finished products. Every detail of the work requires the team to think deeply whether it conforms to the logic of the product background and insight into the follow-up reaction of consumers, then conduct pre-sales marketing of products.\n\nNFT design shoulders the important mission of promoting the progress of the world. Of all the NFT designed by Crypto Art House, we bring more people-oriented, caring, social, environmental and market relations. Thus consumers can feel the story background of different NFT while collecting, and at the same time meet customer requirements and create economic value.\n\n\"We believe that Concept Art House will continue to be a creative powerhouse in the digital content and NFT arena, which we know first hand from our working relationship and collaboration on many exciting projects including our upcoming UFC digital collectibles experience launching on Flow.\" Roham Gharegozlou, the CEO of Dapper Labs commented.\n\nUnconsciously, it is surprising to see Concept Art House has been going on for so long. Looking back on the journey, we are full of gratitude, and excited when we see the direction of our progress! Let's move on together.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1655170959, "digest": "QgwZEWXR_3FzNC716u5-riuigPC1K7LEYt49zRnUfj0", "contributor": "0xDa1d7A58c7927830c5252d7B6DCe344c3666DAfD"}
{"id": "S-btxMyDsJavUBJmXCSc0-WGO4few55GpCKF13j6G1k", "title": "Junk Bond", "body": "## What Is a Junk Bond?\n\nJunk bonds are bonds that carry a higher risk of default than most bonds issued by corporations and governments. A bond is a debt or promise to pay investors interest payments along with the return of invested principal in exchange for buying the bond. Junk bonds represent bonds issued by companies that are financially struggling and have a high risk of [defaulting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) or not paying their interest payments or repaying the principal to investors.\n\nJunk bonds are also called [high-yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp) bonds since the higher yield is needed to help offset any risk of default.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A junk bond is debt that has been given a low credit rating by a ratings agency, below investment grade.\n* As a result, these bonds are riskier since chances that the issuer will default or experience a credit event are higher.\n* Because of the higher risk, investors are compensated with higher interest rates, which is why junk bonds are also called high-yield bonds.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 19 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:19\n\n#### Junk Bond\n\n## Junk Bonds Explained\n\nFrom a technical viewpoint, a high-yield, or \"junk\" bond is very similar to regular corporate bonds. Both represent debt issued by a firm with the promise to pay interest and to return the principal at maturity. Junk bonds differ because of their issuers' poorer credit quality.\n\nBonds are fixed-income debt instruments that corporations and governments issue to investors to raise capital. When investors buy bonds, they're effectively loaning money to the issuer who promises to repay the money on a specific date called the maturity date. At maturity, the investor is repaid the principal amount invested. Most bonds pay investors an annual interest rate during the life of the bond, called a coupon rate.\n\nFor example, a bond that has a 5% annual coupon rate means that an investor who purchases the bond earns 5% per year. So, a bond with a $1,000 face—or par—value will receive 5% x $1,000 which comes to $50 each year until the bond matures.\n\n## Higher Risk Equates to Higher Yield\n\nA bond that has a high risk of the underlying company defaulting is called a junk bond. Companies that issue junk bonds are typically start-ups or companies that are struggling financially. Junk bonds carry risk since investors are unsure whether they'll be repaid their principal and earn regular interest payments. As a result, junk bonds pay a higher yield than their safer counterparts to help compensate investors for the added level of risk. Companies are willing to pay the high yield because they need to attract investors to fund their operations.\n\nPros\n\n* Junk bonds return higher yields than most other fixed-income debt securities.\n* Junk bonds have the potential of significant price increases should the company's financial situation improve.\n* Junk bonds serve as a risk indicator of when investors are willing to take on risk or avoid risk in the market.\n\nCons\n\n* Junk bonds have a higher risk of default than most bonds with better credit ratings.\n* Junk bond prices can exhibit volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the issuer's financial performance.\n* Active junk bond markets can indicate an overbought market meaning investors are too complacent with risk and may lead to market downturns.\n\n## Junk Bonds as a Market Indicator\n\nSome investors buy junk bonds to profit from potential price increases as the financial security of the underlying company improves, and not necessarily for the return of interest income. Also, investors that predict bond prices to rise are betting there will be increased buying interest for high-yield bonds—even these lower rated ones—due to a change in [market risk sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp). For example, if investors believe economic conditions are improving in the U.S. or abroad, they might purchase junk bonds of companies that will show improvement along with the economy.\n\nAs a result, increased buying interest of junk bonds serves as a market-risk indicator for some investors. If investors are buying junk bonds, market participants are willing to take on more risk due to a perceived improving economy. Conversely, if junk bonds are selling off with prices falling, it usually means that investors are more [risk averse](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskaverse.asp) and are opting for more secure and stable investments.\n\nAlthough a surge in junk bond investing usually translates to increased optimism in the market, it could also point to too much optimism in the market.\n\nIt's important to note that junk bonds have much larger price swings than bonds of higher quality. Investors looking to purchase junk bonds can either buy the bonds individually through a broker or invest in a junk bond fund managed by a professional portfolio manager.\n\n## Improving Financials Affect Junk Bonds\n\nIf the underlying company performs well financially, its bonds will have improved credit ratings and usually attract buying interest from investors. As a result, the bond's price rises as investors flood in, willing to pay for the financially viable issuer. Conversely, companies that are performing poorly will likely have low or lowered credit ratings. These falling opinions might cause buyers to back off. Companies with poor credit ratings typically offer high yields to attract investors and to compensate them for the added level of risk.\n\nThe result is bonds issued by companies with positive credit ratings usually pay lower interest rates on their debt instruments as compared to companies with poor credit ratings. Many bond investors monitor the credit ratings of bonds.\n\n## Credit Ratings and Junk Bonds\n\nAlthough junk bonds are considered risky investments, investors can monitor a bond's level of risk by reviewing the bond's credit rating. A [credit rating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) is an assessment of the creditworthiness of an issuer and its outstanding debt in the form of bonds. The company's credit rating, and ultimately the bond's credit rating, impact the market price of a bond and its offering interest rate.\n\n[Credit-rating agencies](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/history-credit-rating-agencies.asp) measure the creditworthiness of all corporate and government bonds, giving investors insight into the risks involved in the debt securities. Credit rating agencies assign letter grades for their view of the issue.\n\nFor example, Standard & Poor’s has a credit rating scale ranging from AAA—excellent—to lower ratings of C and D. Any bond that carries a rating lower than BB is said to be of speculative-grade or a junk bond. This should be a red flag to risk-averse investors. The various letter grades from credit agencies represent the financial viability of the company and the likelihood that the contract terms of the bond terms will be honored.\n\n### Investment Grade\n\nBonds with a rating of [investment-grade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentgrade.asp) come from corporations that have a high probability of paying the regular coupons and returning the principal to investors. For example, Standard & Poor's ratings include:\n\n* AAA—excellent\n* AA—very good\n* A—good\n* BBB—adequate\n\n### \"Junk\" (Speculative)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, once a bond's rating drops into the double-B category, it falls into the junk bond territory. This area can be a scary place for investors who would be harmed by a total loss of their investment dollars in the case of a default.\n\nSome speculative ratings include:\n\n* CCC—currently vulnerable to nonpayment\n* C—highly vulnerable to nonpayment\n* D—in default\n\nCompanies having bonds with these low credit ratings might have difficulty raising the capital needed to fund ongoing business operations. However, if a company manages to improve its financial performance and it's bond's credit rating is upgraded, a substantial appreciation in the bond’s price could happen. Conversely, if a company's financial situation deteriorates, the credit rating of the company and its bonds might be downgraded by credit rating agencies. It is crucial for investors in junk debt to fully investigate the underlying business and all financial documents available before buying.\n\n## Bond Defaults\n\nIf a bond misses a principal and interest payment, the bond is considered to be in default. Default is the failure to repay a debt including interest or principal on a loan or security. Junk bonds have a higher risk of default because of an uncertain revenue stream or a lack of sufficient collateral. The risk of bond defaults increases during economic downturns making these bottom level debts even riskier.\n\n## Real World Example of a Junk Bond\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA) issued a [fixed-rate bond](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C607201) with a maturity date of March 1, 2021 and a fixed semi-annual coupon rate of 1.25%. The debt received an S&P rating of B- in 2014 when it was issued. In October 2020, S&P upgraded its rating to BB- from B+. This is still in junk bond rating territory. A BB rating from S&P means the rating issue is less vulnerable to nonpayment, but still faces major uncertainties or exposure to adverse business or economic conditions.\n\nAlso, the current price of the Tesla offering is $577 as of Oct. 2020, much higher than its 2014 $100 face value, which represents the extra yield that investors are getting above the coupon payment. In other words, despite the BB- rating, the bond is trading at very large premium to its face value. This is because the bonds are convertible to equity. Thus, with shares of Tesla soaring 600% over the last twelve months ending Oct. 26, 2020, the bonds are proving to be valuable surrogates for the equity.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "UFu5tMu2A8Z1SpGbYbnStjbO-S0veSJQBeBx_ptuk7M", "title": "Phillips Curve", "body": "## What is the Phillips Curve?\n\nThe Phillips curve is an economic concept developed by A. W. Phillips stating that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship. The theory claims that with [economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp) comes inflation, which in turn should lead to more jobs and less unemployment. However, the original concept has been somewhat disproven empirically due to the occurrence of [stagflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp) in the 1970s, when there were high levels of both inflation and unemployment.12\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Phillips curve states that inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship. Higher inflation is associated with lower unemployment and vice versa.\n* The Phillips curve was a concept used to guide macroeconomic policy in the 20th century, but was called into question by the stagflation of the 1970's.\n* Understanding the Phillips curve in light of consumer and worker expectations, shows that the relationship between inflation and unemployment may not hold in the long run, or even potentially in the short run.\n\n## Understanding the Phillips Curve\n\nThe concept behind the Phillips curve states the change in unemployment within an economy has a predictable effect on [price inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_inflation.asp). The inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation is depicted as a downward sloping, concave curve, with inflation on the Y-axis and unemployment on the X-axis. Increasing inflation decreases [unemployment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-insurance.asp), and vice versa. Alternatively, a focus on decreasing unemployment also increases inflation, and vice versa.3\n\nThe belief in the 1960s was that any fiscal stimulus would increase [aggregate demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp) and initiate the following effects. Labor demand increases, the pool of unemployed workers subsequently decreases and companies increase wages to compete and attract a smaller talent pool. The corporate cost of wages increases and companies pass along those costs to consumers in the form of price increases.\n\nThis belief system caused many governments to adopt a \"stop-go\" strategy where a [target rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/target-rate.asp) of inflation was established, and fiscal and [monetary policies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) were used to expand or contract the economy to achieve the target rate. However, the stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment broke down in the 1970s with the rise of stagflation, calling into question the validity of the Phillips curve.12\n\nOn August 27, 2020 the Federal Reserve announced that it will no longer raise interest rates due to unemployment falling below a certain level if inflation remains low. It also changed its inflation target to an average, meaning that it will allow inflation to rise somewhat above its 2% target to make up for periods when it was below 2%.45\n\n## The Phillips Curve and Stagflation\n\nStagflation occurs when an economy experiences stagnant economic growth, high unemployment and high price inflation. This scenario, of course, directly contradicts the theory behind the Philips curve. The United States never experienced stagflation until the 1970s, when rising unemployment did not coincide with declining inflation.6 Between 1973 and 1975, the U.S. economy posted six consecutive quarters of declining GDP and at the same time tripled its inflation.7\n\n## Expectations and the Long Run Phillips Curve\n\nThe phenomenon of stagflation and the break down in the Phillips curve led economists to look more deeply at the role of expectations in the relationship between unemployment and inflation. Because workers and consumers can [adapt their expectations](https://www.investopedia.com/behavioral-economics-4689799) about future inflation rates based on current rates of inflation and unemployment, the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment could only hold over the short-run.2\n\nWhen the central bank increases inflation in order to push unemployment lower, it may cause an initial shift along the short-run Phillips curve, but as worker and consumer expectations about inflation adapt to the new environment, in the long-run, the Phillips curve itself can shift outward. This is especially thought to be the case around the [natural rate of unemployment or NAIRU (Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/naturalunemployment.asp), which essentially represents the normal rate of frictional and institutional unemployment in the economy. So in the long-run, if expectations can adapt to changes in inflation rates then the long-run Phillips curve resembles and vertical line at the NAIRU; monetary policy simply raises or lowers the inflation rate aftermarket expectations have worked themselves out.82\n\nIn the period of stagflation, workers and consumers may even begin to [rationally expect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rationaltheoryofexpectations.asp) inflation rates to increase as soon as they become aware that the monetary authority plans to embark on expansionary monetary policy. This can cause an outward shift in the short-run Phillips curve even before the expansionary monetary policy has been carried out, so that even in the short run the policy has little effect on lowering unemployment, and in effect, the short-run Phillips curve also becomes a vertical line at the NAIRU.", "timestamp": 1655170923, "digest": "ndWHtB9MQ3PN3UrTXAlH7IP6wzwH99EvW5ITWlvvrzY", "contributor": "0x959D92bCD3CADEc9eb35a8F6eB07578537fB9c50"}
{"id": "X-cnEX-CO1-jJCUuvQmvpZA5x2q0tS881GBbywdodQA", "title": "Roadmaps lay out all the possible paths", "body": "Two weeks ago, in my essay *[An Image Problem](https://mirror.xyz/0x839846a00f25f01DcB7446A50C92AfB5B24E1b03/Bz3kEHZtGoZIQDSuSt4GL30rO5G42yUMjRdSz-Bg_K0)*, I examined what I find to be a significant issue with the current state of the NFT space … the fact that “status” is the only utility that buyers are interested in. I proposed that we need to focus instead on developing IRL value and utility.\n\nLast week, in my essay called *[“Composability Is the Great Value Proposition of Web3”](https://mirror.xyz/0x839846a00f25f01DcB7446A50C92AfB5B24E1b03/vi7mBpeDnQY-fdisHnC4Ei1RohJO3CZLnrSPFA_CPww)*, I delved deeper into one way to bring real-world value to our NFT projects through what I call *decentralized storytelling*, where writing of fiction — whether a novel, a short story, a film or TV show script, or a graphic novel — is not done in isolation but rather done with the fans and community.\n\nToday, I want to explore a little deeper into my project — THE JOE SPUTNIK CHRONICLES — and explain how I see this coming together.\n\n*CAVEAT: this is not the only way to do it, nor the only project that creators should try out these theories. The Sputnik project is merely my way of testing these ideas. Anyone is welcome to join the project and contribute. Or simply track the project and then apply the lessons learned to their own project. If that’s you, please reach out. Let’s build great stories together.*\n\n## A Bit of History\n\nIn 2010, I worked for a large corporation and was editor of a magazine produced quarterly for the employees, vendors, and customers of the company. The company operated in over 150 countries around the world and it was my job to travel to the various locations and write a feature article for each issue about that location.\n\nOn this particular trip, I visited Dubai, UAE and then on to Cairo, Egypt. As I sat in the lobby of my Cairo hotel in probably week three of the trip, I was mentally worn out.\n\nAfter all, I had just completed 19 in-person interviews in a single day. A record I hope I never break!\n\nIt was a rare day off and I was trying to refocus my mind away from work, work, work.\n\nInstead, I began thinking about some of my fiction projects.\n\nAlthough I made my living as a corporate newsletter and magazine writer/editor, my real passion in writing is fiction. I spoken before about the power of story. \n\nAs I sat there mulling things, a character introduced himself.\n\n“My name is Joe Sputnik,” he said inside my mind.\n\nOver the next couple of years, I filled up two composition notebooks with story ideas, notes, character sketches, etc. And I wrote a draft of a hardboiled PI novel that I called *The Butterfly Collector.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/121U9omtLl9dLyBk9SK0X.jpg?height=3024&width=3024)\n\nI only published the novel on my website; never to Amazon and I never submitted it to any publishers for their consideration.\n\nLife got in the way.\n\nFlash forward a dozen years and more than a few other fiction projects:\n\n* *The 64 Testaments of Krill* — a dark fantasy horror novella series, self published on Amazon (under the pen name M. Boris)\n* *The Geriatric Squad* — a superhero spoof movie script\n* *Zombies from Outer Space* — a zombie/alien invasion TV series\n* *The Briny Deep* — a creature feature horror film script\n* *Kilroy Was Here* — a WW2 spy fiction novel (series eventually)\n\nI also built, ran, and eventually sunsetted a small publishing business that republished old, classic, and out-of-print murder mystery stories … amazing shorts, novellas, and novels dating back to the 1890s, up to about 1945.\n\nBut after the Krill series of novellas languished on Amazon, I realized I had tackled the project wrong.\n\n![Book 1 of The 64 Testaments of Krill](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tsx02Wcd4H8xa0F3t7L5U.jpg?height=500&width=309)\n\nI’d written and published seven novellas, then looked up to find my market. And that I’d missed the mark.\n\nGreat stories. I’m proud of them and am confident they can find an audience. Just maybe not on Amazon.\n\nWhat I missed there was building community, and community involvement around that story. And doing so FIRST. Then writing the stories.\n\nIn the 1970s, author Harlan Ellison wrote his novels while sitting in a storefront window. He’d bang out a page on his manual typewriter, then paste it onto the window so that passers-by could read it.\n\nEventually, a crowd would assemble and he could judge his writing *at the moment of creation* by their reactions.\n\nCharles Dickens did much the same. He wrote most of his now required reading books, like *The Pickwick Papers* in serial form, then hawked them to his readers on the street corner.\n\nEach week, he’d get feedback on favorite or hated characters and plot directions. With that, he could adjust his story to suit the tastes and likes of his readers.\n\nBoth of these writers, and many others, wrote with the immediate input of their readers and fans. They wrote within their community, building community (fans) around their work and using the immediate feedback to make better stories. Stories that the fans were hungry for and would buy, then read and get value from.\n\nThis is what I plan to do with my Joe Sputnik saga.\n\n## The Project Outline\n\nI mentioned, above, the original novel that I wrote and completed in 2012.\n\nAs I began to learn about web3 and NFTs, especially for fiction, that story reasserted itself in my memory.\n\n“My story,” Joe told me, “is the perfect setting to explore these wild concepts of decentralization, a blockchain run world, and the promises and problems it may bring.”\n\nThe story was originally set in 2041. For no other reason than the fact that the classic pulp-style hardboiled PI novel was set in 1941 (or so). I’ve shifted the setting slightly for the V2 of the novel to 2047 (25 years from 2022). ’Cause, why not?!\n\nSo the idea was hatched to rewrite the novel from scratch and integrate themes and concepts of blockchain, defi, etc. The skeleton of the plot would not change — who was getting murdered by what psychopath and why my hero, Joe, was pulled against his will into the mystery.\n\nThe rewritten novel, *The Butterfly Collector* v2, will be released in early September as a limited edition NFT.\n\nI am riffing off of the successful *PUNKS Comic* NFT project that ran at the tail end of 2021. You can read their Roadmap and details on their website: <https://punkscomic.com/>.\n\nBut to summarize, they took the popular PUNKS NFT collection and built characters around individual NFTs. Then the team wrote a comic book with those characters.\n\nCuy Sheffield, in his article [“Fantasy Hollywood” — Crypto and Community-Owned Characters](https://future.com/crypto-and-community-owned-characters/) said that this is one way to create what he terms “a character DAO” where the NFT exists and a story is built upon that NFT collection.\n\nBuyers could opt in for either the PDF edition or a print edition. By keeping or burning either copy, they would gain extra benefits, like access to certain vaults with other valuable NFTs contained within.\n\nI don’t have access to these valuable vaults but the concept I’m developing is similar … provide a limited number of ebook (either PDF or more likely ePub and/or Kindle format) novels, plus (or instead of) a high quality, maybe leather bound, gold embossed print edition.\n\nBuy and hodl the ebook, get XYZ.\n\nBuy and hodl the print book, get ABC.\n\nWhat those bonuses are, I do not know yet. One of the things I am hoping for is that my new community will help me develop. But a few ideas:\n\n* access to special collections of NFTs … the classic jpegs of various characters\n* ability to spin off new stories and new characters\n* ability to create new editions (comics, graphic novels, films) of various stories\n\nThe overall idea is to develop a decentralized system for storytelling, using the Joe Sputnik metaverse as the playing field. A fictional metaverse to try stuff and break things. \n\nThis is what Sheffield describes in his article (link above) as “a specific character that already comes with a backstory and identity that inspires the creation of NFTs, but then enables a community of collectors to participate in its evolution.”\n\nBy buying and hodl’ing the various NFTs and/or the soon-to-be-available $SPUTNIK token, you get access to the soon-to-be-build DAO and the stories within.\n\nTo share and trade.\n\nTo build and explore.\n\nWhatever.\n\nAnd the stories themselves remain free (a public good) for anyone who wants to read them. \n\n## The Project Roadmap\n\nI know the term “roadmap” has a bit of a bad connotation at the moment. But this is just a breakdown of what I’m planning. It is subject to change based on reader/fan/supporter input.\n\nThis is a broad overview. With some specific dates. \n\nOn 20 June, I will be opening up a crowdfunding project to raise capital for this project. It will enable me to work on this full time and will enable me to produce the content on the schedule I will outline. It will also enable me to bring on collaborators who can financially benefit from their work as well. \n\nBenefits to crowdfund supporters:\n\n* access to watch me write *live* in my (virtual) storefront window; probably on a Discord channel for lack of a better option (got a better idea? Let me know! Maybe a real store window in the metaverse!)\n* access (in lieu of the above, or in addition) to my “daily pages” … after 25+ years as a professional writer, I write fast and can produce 5,000 words a day (especially if I’m doing this full time) … *this includes the rewrites for v2 of The Butterfly Collector as I don't he page one rewrite!* \n* ability to provide input and story direction as the storyline is developed (both the short stories and the novel\n* early access (I think this is technically possible) to the short story NFT sales so you don’t risk missing out\n\nI don’t care if you contribute 0.10 ETH of 10 ETH. It may dictate the power of your vote (I’m still learning tokenomics) but everyone is invited to hop aboard and help support the project.\n\nThen, on 4 July, the first short story … *[Like A Moth To A Flame](https://mirror.xyz/0x839846a00f25f01DcB7446A50C92AfB5B24E1b03/qW03oE20ZQmD6z8jRUnMBkjpMfplkUoI0IEIE90Txl4)* … will be released as a 1/10 edition NFT. It, and all short stories, will remain free for anyone to read.\n\nIn fact, to get a taste of my writing style and the story, you can go ahead and read this short story at the link above.\n\nAnyone who hodl’s a short story NFT will get:\n\n* early access to future stories\n* opportunity to contribute directly to the stories\n* governance on character decisions, etc.\n\nAdditionally, I will create a very limited print run of the full volume of short stories. I expect to create eight to ten short stories in this series (something akin to a modern TV series with eight to ten episodes in a season).\n\nSo, anyone who buys and hodl’s all ten stories will get a print volume containing all of the stories. Each copy will have its own unique cover artwork and will be numbered, then signed by me as the author.\n\n*This is one of the crucial aspects of the crowdfunding effort … bringing into the community, as a collaborator, an artist who can create custom artwork for these covers, among other artwork.*\n\n*As a long time freelancer myself, I know the struggles of low paying gigs and I DO NOT want to pay a pittance to someone on Fiverr, then profit myself. This is about community and therefore the crowdfund must provide revenue to adequately and ethically compensate an artist.*\n\nSince short story #1 will only ever have a maximum of ten NFT editions available, there will be a maximum of ten of these print volumes available.\n\nI will be releasing a new short story each Monday, starting on July 4 and running through either August 22 or September 5. The end date depends on how many short stories end up in this series; and that is based on feedback from you, my reader and fan.\n\nThe week following the last short story, I will release *The Butterfly Collector, v2* novel NFT.\n\n## I have a few other NFT items in mind\n\nThese include a limited print run of the first draft of my novel. Each of maybe 100 would be printed on my laser printer, bound with heavy card stock, and individually numbered and signed.\n\nLike numbered prints of a famous painting. Genuine and rare.\n\nI also spoke last week in my essay “Composability Is the Great Value Proposition of Web3” about how I see the standard jpeg NFT providing additional utility to hodlrs.\n\nIn summary, each character I create in my stories would have their own jpg NFT. For main characters, like Joe, it would be a 1/1.\n\nFor larger groups, like a bunch of goons who are always getting in Joe’s way (think the armies of kung fu thugs that Jackie Chan periodically fights), they would be semi-rare or even common.\n\n![Everybody was Kung Fu fighting! ](https://c.tenor.com/u546WZi9VRMAAAAM/whirlwind-technique-fight.gif)\n\nIn *The Butterfly Collector*, for example, there is a semi-secret society of women who are known as The Painted Ladies. Each has a unique butterfly tattoo (NFT collection?) as well a delicate tattoo artwork covering their bodies *(story hint: the tattoos tell their individual life story and Joe discovers that they are clues to why someone is murdering these young women)*.\n\nSociety rules dictate that there are only a specific number of Painted Ladies at any given time … a limited edition NFT collection.\n\nThe idea, then, is that anyone can acquire one of, or perhaps a set of, these NFTs. Not a new idea.\n\nBut here is my twist.\n\nWhat if you could buy a set of 1/1 NFTs and play them with your frens like collectable card games, for instance *MAGIC: THE GATHERING* or characters in an RPG game like *Dungeons & Dragons*?\n\nEach character NFT has various hit points or values based on who that character is. Strength and skills in areas like hand-to-hand combat or diplomacy. All characteristics based on what happens in a story. And characteristics that can change based on story.\n\nIf these NFTs were available in packs of ten, none visible to the buyer beforehand, they become like the baseball card collections that you could buy in a cellophane wrapper. You might get a bunch of nobodies or you might get a valuable rookie card. The thrill is in the gamble on what NFTs you might get in the collection.\n\nThen, you can play those against others’ collections to win and build your NFT collections.\n\nWin other’s NFTs. Build war packs. Rule the metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H5Xvtv56E091l-ZcwHhB5.png?height=1920&width=1200)\n\nI’ll be honest … I have no idea how to make this work. At least on a technical side. I need to bring in developers and people who understand how to build/create smart contracts that will manage all of this. Again, the crowdfunding budget includes this and other costs to develop this into a full blown project and DAO, while financially supporting those actively involved.\n\nBut I think it has potential to add a little fun and game play to buying and hodl’ing an NFT.\n\n## The Vision\n\nI have been inspired by the thinking of a lot of other folks. And, maybe because creative thinking is my bread-and-butter, I am finding ways of putting their ideas together into a new form (the “composability” thing I talked about last week). What I'm calling decentalized storytelling. \n\nMy vision is to use the Joe Sputnik story as a testbed for what I’ve talked about with decentralized storytelling. What Cuy Sheffield talked about with character DAOs and open source character IPs. What so many have talked about with the web3 creator economy. \n\n![https://twitter.com/azfnft/status/1536149094216761344?t=lFHBRGoF0N7vfQx-qf6kTA&s=19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m6IPg7FS2QVDZgNJJQRaI.jpg?height=2280&width=1080)\n\nI want to build a collaborative storytelling system where others can tell independent stories within the defined universe/metaverse by minting/staking (not sure of terminology) characters … creators (or *instigators*, as I call them) would have, say, a 35% take in their characters or stories and 65% would go to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe idea being that as a character DAO or a community around the Sputnik metaverse, we build new and amazing stories together.\n\nMaybe someone will come along who is a filmmaker and sees potential in either *The Butterfly Collector* as a film or sees another storyline to pursue. He can, through community voting, become the custodian or instigator of that project.\n\nIf he uses my novel as the basis, I would receive a royalty but, as instigator of the film, he would gain the 35% owner stake. My royalty (or whomever is custodian on the story/character) would be maybe 10% of the 65% that goes into the treasury.\n\nAnd the funds to produce the film would come from the DAO treasury, as well. The producer could petition the DAO for funds to create his project.\n\nOr a graphic novelist could adapt a story. Same process; different media.\n\nThe point is that this is not about me getting rich because I came up with the original idea. The idea is that my original idea is a platform from which multiple avenues of creation can grow.\n\nAnd the community can benefit. Financially and in other ways.\n\nRoles, then, in this vision, would include:\n\n* INSTIGATOR → creates, defines a character or set of characters, or a story/product (novel, comic, movie, etc.); has CUSTODIAL ownership; 2 votes to everyone else’s 1; management/administrative not authority\n* CUSTODIAN → anyone who is responsible for managing a character’s individual IP; may be the INSTIGATOR or be assigned the role at the behest of the INSTIGATOR\n* SUB-INSTIGATOR → upon INSTIGATOR’s approval, instigates a new story based on the character\n\nAnd certainly more.\n\n## However …\n\nI am a creative person. I have an (over) active imagination and can conceive of all manner of strange things. Which is precisely what this “roadmap” is. It is an atlas of the territory and I’ve scribbled all over it with a crayon.\n\nI am also a writer. When I am able to focus on story, without the headaches and time sucks of outside commitments, I can write 5,000 words a day. My record is over 12,000. I can a erage 7 – 9,000 in a day, 6+ days a week. \n\nThe script, *The Briny Deep*, that I mentioned above … from concept to finished draft in 11 days.\n\nMost of the *Testaments of Krill* stories were written in less than a week and average about 27,000 words.\n\nThe story creation and publication I can do. That is like breathing air to me. It is simultaneously the hardest and most wonderful work I can do.\n\nIts the technical aspects that I struggle with. I know Javascript and React. Enough, anyway, to know I’ll never be a developer. Enough to build a basic website and really get in over my head.\n\nThat is one reason I need help. Why I need you.\n\nMaybe you are a developer and can build out the NFT card game I spoke about above.\n\nMaybe you’re an expert at creating and managing DAOs.\n\nMaybe you're that graphic novelist/artist looking for a project.\n\nMaybe you're a filmmaker or TV show producer.\n\nI cannot build this project without help. Without input. Without skills that I do not have.\n\nI am looking to build community around this idea. Community that grows together as we create amazing stories.\n\nNext Monday, 20 June, I will be opening up a crowdfunding effort to raise the capital I need to begin this journey. The funds required to build what may be the first character DAO.\n\n“There is a market for a decentralized version of a “fantasy Hollywood,” too — it just hasn’t been met yet,” said Sheffield in his article.\n\nI aim to make this project the first and make it stand as a shining example of what can be done with storytelling if creatives of all kinds come together to build something together.\n\nI hope you will join me.\n\nNext Monday, I will go deeper into my ideas on decentralized storytelling and how this character DAO process could work. I am meeting with several folks this week to learn more and see how their systems stack up as platforms to use. I will report on what I learn and what I decide to do, initially. I will continue to seek feedback as the project grows.\n\nRight now, with these essays pontificating on my theories, and the short stories, I am taking advantage of the excellent platform Mirror.xyz.\n\nThe crowdfund will also be hosted on Mirror.xyz.\n\nUntil then, follow me on Twitter … @jspi_nft or check out the project on the main website [www.jspi.xyz](https://www.jspi.xyz) (yes, I built it myself using Remix.run … see why I need your help!!?? 😁😜). Or email me directly at rich@joesputnipi.com with questions, comments, or to tell me where I’ve missed the boat.\n\n\n---\n\n*The Pulpeteer (pronounced pulp·ateer; taken from an essay by pulp writer Lester Dent who created the Doc Savage character and series) is a full time author and the warped mind behind the metaverse fiction NFT project — THE JOE SPUTNIK CHRONICLES, a metaverse hardboiled detective fiction series — where he is exploring the concepts and practical application of decentralized storytelling and open source character IP as a means to tell better stories.*\n\n*Follow the saga of Joe Sputnik, PI in 2047 New York City as he battles hidden forces that threaten to dominate what has become a fully decentralized world → [www.jspi.xyz](http://www.jspi.xyz/)*\n\n*Or follow his thoughts on decentalized storytelling and open source character IPs on Twitter → @jspi_nft*", "timestamp": 1655170887, "digest": "jkKC5bCLo70GYAF5ofVUjSPn2xBmt3gr7BxGuR5sZPE", "contributor": "0x839846a00f25f01DcB7446A50C92AfB5B24E1b03"}
{"id": "y5gpE6o12rCM9OgPIE5afHzLbLjMYTPUHZUxLxE0Iqk", "title": "Jumbo Loan", "body": "## What Is a Jumbo Loan?\n\nA jumbo loan, also known as a jumbo mortgage, is a type of financing that exceeds the limits set by the [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhfa.asp) (FHFA). Unlike conventional mortgages, a jumbo loan is not eligible to be purchased, guaranteed, or [securitized ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitize.asp)by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Designed to finance luxury properties and homes in highly competitive local real estate markets, jumbo mortgages come with unique [underwriting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp) requirements and tax implications. These kinds of mortgages have gained traction as the housing market continues to recover following the [Great Recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp).\n\nThe value of a jumbo mortgage varies by state—and even county. The FHFA sets the [conforming loan limit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conformingloanlimit.asp) size for different areas on an annual basis. The limit for 2022 was set at $647,200 for most of the country. This was an increase of $98,950 from the 2021 limit of $548,250. For counties that have higher home values, the baseline limit is set at $970,800, or 150% of $647,200.1\n\nThe FHFA has a different set of provisions for areas outside of the continental United States for loan limit calculations. As a result, the baseline limit for a jumbo loan in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as of 2022 is also $970,800. That amount may actually be even higher in counties that have higher home values.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A jumbo loan is a type of financing that exceeds the limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and cannot be purchased, guaranteed, or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.\n* Homeowners must undergo more rigorous credit requirements than those applying for a conventional loan.\n* Approval requires a stellar credit score and a very low debt-to-income ratio. \n* The average APR for a jumbo mortgage is often par with conventional mortgages, while down payments are roughly 10% to 15% of the total purchase price.\n\n## How a Jumbo Loan Works\n\nIf you have your sights set on a home that costs close to half a million dollars or more—and you don't have that much sitting in a bank account—you're probably going to need a jumbo mortgage. And if you’re trying to land one, you’ll face much more rigorous credit requirements than homeowners applying for a conventional loan. That’s because jumbo loans carry more credit risk for the lender since there is no guarantee by [Fannie Mae](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/) or [Freddie Mac](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp). There's also more risk because more money is involved.\n\nJust like traditional mortgages, minimum requirements for a jumbo have become increasingly stringent since 2008. To get approved, you’ll need a stellar credit score—700 or above—and a very low [debt-to-income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp) (DTI) ratio. The DTI should be under 43% and preferably closer to 36%. Although they are [nonconforming mortgages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non_conforming.asp), jumbos still must fall within the guidelines of what the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb.asp) considers a “qualified mortgage”—a lending system with standardized terms and rules, such as the 43% DTI.2\n\nYou’ll need to prove you have accessible cash on hand to cover your payments, which are likely to be very high if you opt for a standard 30-year [fixed-rate mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-rate_mortgage.asp). Specific income levels and reserves depend on the size of the overall loan, but all borrowers need 30 days of pay stubs and W2 tax forms stretching back two years. If you're self-employed, the income requirements are greater: Two years of tax returns and at least 60 days of current bank statements. The borrower also needs provable [liquid assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp) to qualify and cash reserves equal to six months of the mortgage payments. And all applicants have to show proper documentation on all other loans held and proof of ownership of non-liquid assets (like other real estate).\n\n## Jumbo Loan Rates\n\nWhile jumbo mortgages used to carry [higher interest rates ](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5094943)than conventional mortgages, the gap has been closing in recent years. Today, the average [annual percentage rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp) (APR) for a jumbo mortgage is often par with conventional mortgages—and in some cases, actually lower. As of January 1, 2022, Wells Fargo, for example, charged an APR of 3.360% on a 30-year fixed-rate conforming loan and 3.065% for the same term on a jumbo loan.3 \n\nEven though the [government-sponsored enterprises](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp) can't handle them, jumbo loans are often securitized by other financial institutions; since these securities carry more risk, they trade at a [yield premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield_spread_premium.asp) to conventional securitized mortgages. However, this [spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp) has been reduced with the interest rate of the loans themselves.\n\n## Down Payment on a Jumbo Loan\n\nFortunately, down payment requirements have loosened over the same time period. In the past, jumbo mortgage lenders often required home buyers to put up 30% of the residence's purchase price (compared to 20% for conventional mortgages). Now, that figure has fallen as low as 10% to 15%. As with any mortgage, there can be various advantages to making a higher down payment—among them, to [avoid the cost of the private mortgage insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/avoid-pmi/) lenders require for down payments below 20%.\n\n## Who Should Take Out a Jumbo Loan?\n\nHow much you can ultimately borrow depends, of course, on your assets, your credit score, and the value of the property you're interested in buying. These mortgages are considered most appropriate for a segment of high-income earners who make between $250,000 and $500,000 a year. This segment is known as HENRY, an acronym for [high earners, not rich yet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-earners-not-yet-rich-henrys.asp). Basically, these are people who generally make a lot of money but don't have millions in extra cash or other assets accumulated—yet.\n\nWhile an individual in the HENRY segment may not have amassed the wealth to purchase an expensive new home with cash, such high-income individuals do usually have better credit scores and more extensively established [credit histories](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp) than the average homebuyer seeking a conventional mortgage loan for a lower amount. They also tend to have more solidly established retirement accounts. They often have been contributing for a longer period of time than lower-income earners.\n\nDon't expect a big tax break on a jumbo loan. The cap on the mortgage interest deduction is limited to $750,000 for new mortgage debt.4\n\nThese are just the sorts of individuals that institutions love to sign up for long-term products, partly because they often need additional [wealth management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealthmanagement.asp) services. Plus, it's more practical for a bank to administer a single $2 million mortgage than 10 loans valued at $200,000 apiece.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020\n\n## Special Considerations for a Jumbo Loan\n\nJust because you may qualify for one of these loans doesn't mean you should take one out. You certainly shouldn't if you are counting on it furnishing you with a substantial tax break, for example.\n\nYou’re probably aware that you can deduct the [mortgage interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgageinterest.asp) you paid for any given year from your taxes, providing you itemize your deductions. But you probably never had to worry about the cap the IRS places on this deduction—a cap that was lowered by the passage of the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/). Anyone who got a mortgage on Dec. 14, 2017, or earlier can deduct interest on up to $1 million in debt, which is the amount of the old cap. But for home purchases made after Dec. 14, 2017, you can only deduct the interest on up to $750,000 in mortgage debt. If your mortgage is larger, you don't get the full deduction. If you plan to take out a $2 million jumbo mortgage that accrues $80,000 in interest a year, for example, you can only deduct $30,000—the interest on the first $750,000 of your mortgage. In effect, you only get a tax break on 37.5% of the mortgage interest.4\n\nThat means you should borrow with care and crunch the numbers carefully to see what you can truly afford and what kinds of tax benefits you will receive. With the state and local tax deduction limited to $10,000 a year, due to the same tax bill, a highly taxed property will also cost you more to own. One other strategy: Compare terms to see if taking out a smaller conforming loan, plus a second loan, instead of one big jumbo, might prove better for your finances in the long haul.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsut0s2zS5p8shETRRqL8X5mARKE4yyR_nRujA6_Hc5OtdlAv2ygc-jHhbn_n6ig5OPKJNrLDWdVwLwFH5PBtB8O6AFOqFN442IJQ_Wx1NopCf43BGg7mgdM1vrHPcaKosuE9CB74ERthg-KlC8ezyKTtkRXQNvPr7uAOEAxlcKJbAemOqmiT90l-rUNzG25RXorZFFsh9VJCBAVP_sVnLk-YtF0me8Dn1lGVgVwBP2_GhDjx8yJbPS055FoFwCJsxZmPWc4dtvtvE6rX8ageA0ZKFq5LnwReulHXnCQ7K5WjewF9t8QgMvME77KtvRfigpAk84OOrFXpLPG9GE&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMmxFT_h2BBoEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

{"id": "zZBQT2WmkiI8_wP9Xr_TPtjEV7ecD_BsNwJPXHm0bUw", "title": "Juris Doctor (JD)", "body": "## What Is a Juris Doctor (JD)?\n\nThe American law degree, called a Juris Doctor (JD), is a three-year professional degree. Until the latter half of the 20th century, the degree was called a Bachelor of Laws (LLB). However, due to the length of study required in the United States to attain a law degree, the name was changed to reflect its status as a professional degree. A J.D. degree confers recognition that the holder has a professional degree in law.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The American law degree, called a Juris Doctor (JD), is a three-year professional degree.\n* Law school applicants must already have a bachelor's degree.\n* It typically takes three years to complete the J.D. degree, after which the graduate must pass the bar exam to practice law.\n* Drexel, Rutgers, Columbia, and Fordham are among the schools that offer a two-year J.D. degree option.\n* According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2020 median pay for a lawyer was $126,930.\n\n## Understanding Juris Doctor (JD)\n\nSome schools offer a joint J.D. and [MBA](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011415/when-mba-worth-it.asp) degree so that students can complete both degrees in less time than it would take to complete each separately. Other combined graduate degrees include public policy, medicine, and bioengineering.\n\nLaw school applicants must already have a [bachelor's degree](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionaleducation/11/accelerated-bachelors-masters-degree.asp). It typically takes three years to complete the J.D. degree, after which the graduate must pass the [bar](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barchart.asp) exam to practice law. Each state and the District of Columbia has its own bar exam.\n\n## History of the JD Degree\n\nThe first lawyers trained in the United States underwent an apprenticeship and training with a lawyer who served as a mentor. Required studies, interpretation of the law, and practical experience varied sharply. The first formal law degree granted in the country was a Bachelor of Law from the College of William and Mary in 1793. Harvard University changed the name of the degree to the Latin \"Legum Baccalaureus,\" known as the LL.B., and led the 19th-century movement for a scientific study of law.1﻿ The LL.B. remains the standard degree in most of the British Commonwealth.2﻿\n\nThe faculty of Harvard Law School first suggested changing the degree from LL.B. to J.D. in 1902 to reflect the professional nature of the degree. In 1903, the University of Chicago, which was one of only five law schools that required students to have a bachelor's degree before enrollment, granted the first J.D. degree. Many law schools offered both an LL.B. to students who entered without a bachelor's degree and a J.D. to students entering with a bachelor's degree.3﻿\n\nBy the early 1960s, most students entered law school with a bachelor's degree. In 1965, the American Bar Association recommended the standard law degree be the J.D., and that decree took effect by the end of the decade.4﻿\n\n## Requirements for a JD Degree\n\nIn order to get into law school, you must have an undergraduate degree, have passed the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), request your official transcripts from your undergraduate institution(s), obtain letters of recommendation, and write a personal statement.\n\n### Complete a Bachelor's Degree\n\nWhile many graduate programs require the completion of certain prerequisite courses, there are no such requirements for prospective law students. However, you must have earned (or be on track to earn) an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution. Your undergraduate grade point average (GPA) is a key indicator law schools consider when evaluating applicants.\n\n### Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT)\n\nYou'll also need to take the LSAT. The basic fee for the LSAT during the 2020-21 academic year is $200, although this cost increases for each law school you apply to. Most people end up paying $500 or more in total LSAT fees. The score you receive on your LSAT is the most important factor in determining your admission into law school.\n\nIt is generally recommended that you spend at least three months studying for the exam, although many people dedicate up to a year studying for the exam. There are many resources online to help you study for the LSAT, including free resources. Organized prep courses that guide you through the different components of the LSAT can be quite expensive. Some individuals opt to hire a private tutor to help them prepare for the LSAT.\n\n### Request Your Official Transcripts\n\nLaw schools require official transcripts from all undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs. Each copy of your official transcript can cost between $10 and $20, so depending on how many schools you apply to, this amount can add up. The process of requesting your transcript and then getting them sent to the appropriate institution can take several days, so make sure that you give yourself adequate time.\n\n### Write a Personal Statement\n\nA personal statement is your opportunity to reveal your personality to the admissions committee. It's a good idea if your personal statement covers your career goals and academic achievements, although there are many different approaches. Some schools may have specific prompts they want you to address in your personal statement.\n\n### Obtain Letters of Recommendation\n\nMost law schools will require at least one letter of recommendation. Your letters of recommendation can be from undergraduate professors or former employers that can speak to various elements of your success.\n\nFuture lawyers who attended a public, ABA-approved school in their state paid an average of $28,186 in tuition and fees in 2019, while out-of-state students paid an average of $41,628. Those who attended private law schools paid an average of $49,312.5﻿\n\n## Two-Year JD Degrees\n\nJob prospects for lawyers fell sharply following the 2008 [financial market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp) collapse, and law school enrollment dropped by 24% from 2010 to 2013. With tuition continuing to rise, some schools have looked at shortening the program.6 Drexel, Rutgers, Columbia, and Fordham are among the schools that offer a two-year J.D. option or allow students to start their first year of law school after completing the third year of college.\n\n## Job Prospects for JD Degrees\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2020 median pay for a lawyer was $126,930. In 2019, there were 813,900 jobs in this field. The projected percent change in employment from 2019 to 2029 for this profession is 4%, which is average. (The average growth rate for all occupations is 4%.)7﻿\n\n## JD Degree FAQs\n\n### What Is a JD Degree Equivalent To?\n\nA J.D. degree, the American law degree, is a three-year professional degree. A J.D. is the minimum educational level for lawyers. The J.D. is considered a professional doctorate. The United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation do not consider a J.D. degree equivalent to a research doctorate, which would confer the recipient the title of \"Doctor.\"8﻿\n\n### Is a JD a Lawyer?\n\nTo become a lawyer, you'll need to earn a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. Once you graduate, you are entitled to take the bar exam and begin the practice of law. Obtaining a J.D. degree alone does not permit you to practice law. You must also pass the bar exam. Every state (and the District of Columbia) has its own bar exam.9﻿\n\n### Is a JD Higher Than a Masters?\n\nWhile the J.D. is the only degree necessary to become a professor of law or to obtain a license to practice law, it is not a research degree. However, there are two types of research degrees available to individuals who are interested in studying law. These are the Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree, which typically requires a J.D. as a prerequisite before pursuing study, and the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D./J.S.D.) degree, which typically requires a Master of Laws as a prerequisite.\n\n### Is Someone With a JD a Doctor?\n\nIt is not customary in the U.S. to address individuals that hold a J.D. as a \"Doctor.\" In the late 1960s, the Canons of Professional Ethics issued a full ethics opinion regarding whether lawyers could ethically use the title \"Doctor.\" The organization came down against this usage, with some exceptions. It is permissible for lawyers to use the title \"Doctor\" when dealing with countries where the use of \"Doctor\" by lawyers is standard practice.

{"id": "2Aqc3qBb8hOJwm1PXWxyXgl0jM2stNse58wnbYA35Lo", "title": "Positive Correlation", "body": "## What Is Positive Correlation?\n\nA positive correlation is a relationship between two variables that move in tandem—that is, in the same direction. A positive correlation exists when one variable decreases as the other variable decreases, or one variable increases while the other increases.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A positive correlation is a relationship between two variables that tend to move in the same direction.\n* A positive correlation exists when one variable tends to decrease as the other variable decreases, or one variable tends to increase when the other increases.\n* In finance, correlations are used to describe how individual stocks move with respect to the wider market.\n* Beta is a common measure of market correlation, usually using the S&P 500 index as a benchmark.\n* A beta of 1.0 describes a stock that is perfectly correlated with the S&P 500. Values higher than 1.0 describe stocks that are more volatile than the S&P 500, while lower values describe stocks that are less volatile.\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 2 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n2:02\n\n#### Correlation\n\n## Understanding Positive Correlation\n\nA perfectly positive [correlation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/022516/4-reasons-why-market-correlation-matters.asp) means that 100% of the time, the variables in question move together by the exact same percentage and direction. A positive correlation can be seen between the demand for a product and the product's associated price. In situations where the available supply stays the same, the price will rise if demand increases.\n\nIn statistics, a perfect positive correlation is represented by the [correlation coefficient](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlationcoefficient.asp) value +1.0, while 0 indicates no correlation, and -1.0 indicates a perfect inverse (negative) correlation.\n\nAdditionally, gains or losses in certain markets may lead to similar movements in associated markets. As the price of fuel rises, the prices of airline tickets also rise. Since airplanes require fuel to operate, an increase in this cost is often passed to the consumer, leading to a positive correlation between fuel prices and airline ticket prices.\n\nA positive correlation does not guarantee [growth](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/13/introduction-to-growth-investing.asp) or benefit. Instead, it is used to denote any two or more variables that move in the same direction together, so when one increases, so does the other. But the existence of a correlation does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between variables.\n\nCorrelation is a form of dependency, where a shift in one variable means a change is likely in the other, or that certain known variables produce specific results. A general example can be seen within complementary product demand. If the demand for vehicles rises, so will the demand for vehicular-related products and services, such as tires. An increase in one area has an effect on complementary industries.\n\nIn some situations, positive psychological responses can cause positive changes within an area. This can be demonstrated within the financial markets, in cases where general positive news about a company leads to a higher stock price.\n\nCorrelation among variables does not necessarily imply causation.\n\n## Positive Correlation in Finance\n\nA simple [example of positive correlation](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042215/what-are-some-examples-positive-correlation-economics.asp) involves the use of an interest-bearing savings account with a set interest rate. The more money that is added to the account, whether through new deposits or earned interest, the more interest that can be accrued. Similarly, a rise in the interest rate will correlate with a rise in interest generated, while a decrease in the interest rate causes a decrease in actual interest accrued.\n\nInvestors and analysts also look at how stock movements correlate with one another and with the broader market. Most stocks have a correlation between each other's price movements somewhere in the middle of the range, with a coefficient of 0 indicating no relationship whatsoever between the two securities. A stock in the online retail space, for example, likely has little correlation with the stock of a tire and auto body shop, while two similar retail companies will see a higher correlation. This is because businesses that have very different operations will produce different products and services using different inputs.\n\nA brick-and-mortar book retailer, on the other hand, is likely to have a [negative correlation](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040115/does-negative-correlation-between-two-stocks-mean-anything.asp) with the stock of Amazon.com, as the online retailer's popularity is typically bad news for traditional book stores. The stock of the popular payment processor PayPal is likely to be positively correlated with the stocks of online retailers that use its services. If the stocks of eBay, Amazon, and Best Buy pick up due to increased online revenue, it is likely that PayPal will experience a similar boost as its fee-driven income picks up and positive earnings reports encourage investors.\n\n## Beta and Correlation\n\nBeta is a common measure of how correlated an individual stock's price is with the broader market, often using the S&P 500 index as a benchmark. If a stock has a [beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) of 1.0, it indicates that its price activity is strongly correlated with the market. A stock with a beta of 1.0 has a systematic risk, but the beta calculation can’t detect any unsystematic risk. Adding a stock to a portfolio with a beta of 1.0 doesn’t add any risk to the portfolio, but it also doesn’t increase the likelihood that the portfolio will provide an excess return.\n\nA beta of less than 1.0 means that the security is theoretically less volatile than the market, meaning the portfolio is less risky with the stock included than without it. For example, utility stocks often have low betas because they tend to move more slowly than market averages.\n\nA beta that is greater than 1.0 indicates that the security's price is theoretically more volatile than the market. For example, if a stock's beta is 1.2, it is assumed to be 20% more volatile than the market. Technology stocks and small caps tend to have higher betas than the market benchmark. This indicates that adding the stock to a portfolio will increase the portfolio’s risk, but also increase its expected return.\n\nSome stocks even have negative betas. A beta of -1.0 means that the stock is inversely correlated to the market benchmark as if it were an opposite, mirror image of the benchmark’s trends. Put options or inverse ETFs are designed to have negative betas, but there are a few industry groups, like gold miners, where a negative beta is also common.\n\n### Beta\n\n*A beta of +1.0 indicates a stock that moves in the same direction as the rest of the market. A beta of -1.0 indicates that a stock moves opposite to the rest of the market.*\n\n## Positive Correlation vs. Inverse Correlation\n\nIn statistics, positive correlation describes the relationship between two variables that change together, while an [inverse correlation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverse-correlation.asp) describes the relationship between two variables which change in opposing directions. Inverse correlation is sometimes described as negative correlation. Examples of positive correlations occur in most people's daily lives. The more hours an employee works, for instance, the larger that employee's paycheck will be at the end of the week. The more money is spent on advertising, the more customers buy from the company.\n\nInverse correlations describe two factors that seesaw relative to each other. Examples include a declining bank balance relative to increased spending habits and reduced gas mileage relative to increased average driving speed. One example of an inverse correlation in the world of investments is the relationship between stocks and bonds. As stock prices rise, the bond market tends to decline, just as the bond market does well when stocks are underperforming.\n\nIt is important to understand that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Variables A and B might rise and fall together, or A might rise as B falls, but it is not always true that the rise of one factor directly influences the rise or fall of the other. Both may be caused by an underlying third factor, such as commodity prices, or the apparent relationship between the variables might be a coincidence.\n\nThe number of people connected to the Internet, for example, has been increasing since its inception, and the price of oil has generally trended upward over the same period.12 This is a positive correlation, but the two factors almost certainly have no meaningful relationship. That both the population of Internet users and the price of oil have increased is explainable by a third factor, namely, general increases due to time passed.\n\n## What Is an Example of Positive Correlation?\n\nOne example of positive correlation is the relationship between [employment and inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/what-happens-when-inflation-and-unemployment-are-positively-correlated.asp#:\\~:text=Historically%2C%20inflation%20and%20unemployment%20have,standpoint%2C%20this%20relationship%20makes%20sense.). High levels of employment require employers to offer higher salaries in order to attract new workers, and higher prices for their products in order to fund those higher salaries. Conversely, periods of high unemployment experience falling consumer demand, resulting in downward pressure on prices and inflation.\n\n## What Is the Relationship Between Beta and Positive Correlation?\n\nBeta is a common measure of the correlation between an individual stock and the wider market, often using the S&P 500 index as a benchmark. A beta value greater than zero indicates that the stock is positively correlated with the market, meaning that its share price tends to rise when the market rises. If a stock has a beta less than 1.0, its movements will be smaller than the movements of the wider market. A beta higher than 1.0 indicates that the stock will fluctuate more than the market as a whole.\n\n## What Is Inverse Correlation?\n\nA positive correlation describes a relationship between variables that move together, and an inverse correlation describes variables that tend to move in opposite directions. This may also be referred to as a negative correlation. In investing, negative correlations are indicated by beta values below zero: a beta of -1.0 indicates a stock whose movements are a mirror opposite of the benchmark's trends.\n\n## Does Correlation Imply Causation?\n\nCorrelation does not require causation, and it is a common logical fallacy to believe otherwise. When two variables are positively correlated, that does not necessarily mean that one variable causes changes in the other. Both variables may be influenced by an unknown third factor, or the apparent relationship between the variables might be a coincidence.", "timestamp": 1655171072, "digest": "b8RLw6R1_mUjp1qfsKIXKn_wMZHQDiwyvAAkZrHpOl4", "contributor": "0x2F6696DAf4CedB63620ca9fE244e70E770dDcc9f"}

{"id": "LzOYqFSNMhGTOZW784eHuQpPx20i_Rz8NYdzQrqYbcQ", "title": "Pre-Market Trading", "body": "## What Is Pre-Market Trading?\n\nPre-market trading is the period of trading activity that occurs before the regular market session. The pre-market [trading session](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingsession.asp) typically occurs between 8 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. EST each trading day. Many investors and [traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) watch the pre-market trading activity to judge the strength and direction of the market in anticipation of the regular trading session.\n\nPre-market trading can only be executed with limited orders through an \"electronic market\" like an alternative trading system (ATS) or [electronic communication network (ECN)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecn.asp). Market makers are not permitted to execute orders until the 9:30 a.m. EST opening bell.1\n\n## Understanding Pre-Market Trading\n\nPre-market trading activity generally has limited volume and liquidity; therefore, large [bid-ask spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) are common.1 Many retail brokers offer pre-market trading but may limit the types of orders that can be made during the pre-market period. Several [direct-access brokers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directaccessbroker.asp) allow access to pre-market trading to commence as early as 4 a.m. EST from Monday through Friday.\n\nIt is important to remember there is very little activity for most stocks so early in the morning unless there is news. The liquidity is also extremely thin, with most stocks only showing [stub quotes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stub-quote.asp). Index-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ([SPY](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=SPY)), have moving quotes due to the trading in the S&P 500 futures contracts. Many of the most widely held [top holdings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/top-holdings.asp) in benchmark indices may also get movement in the event of a significant gap up or down in the S&P 500 futures. Large-cap, widely held stocks such as Apple Inc. ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)) tend to get trades as early as 4:15 a.m. EST.2\n\n[After-hours trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/afterhourstrading.asp) was introduced before pre-market trading. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) introduced after-hours trading in June 1991 by extending trading hours by an hour. The move was a response to increased competition from international exchanges in London and Tokyo and private exchanges, which offered more hours of trading, and 2.24 million shares changed hands in two sessions of trading.3 Over the years, as exchanges became increasingly computerized and the Internet's reach spread across borders, NYSE began extending the number of hours of trading available for trading, eventually allowing pre-market trading between the hours of 4 a.m. and 9:30 a.m.4\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Pre-market trading is trading that occurs between 4 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. EST.\n* Pre-market trading is characterized by thin liquidity, low trading volumes, and large bid-ask spreads.\n\n## Pre-Market Trading: Benefits\n\nPre-market trading and after-hours trading—collectively known as extended-hours trading—share similar benefits and risks. Let's look at the benefits first:\n\n* **Provides an opportunity to react early to overnight news**: Pre-market trading provides the retail investor with an opportunity to react to overnight news before the regular trading session commences. Such news could be corporate earnings (although most companies report earnings after markets close, rather than before the open) or a major company announcement, overnight breaking news such as a geopolitical development, or news emanating from overseas markets. The caveat here is that the pre-market reaction to such news may reverse in the regular trading session. The limited trading volume in the pre-market may provide a signal of weakness or strength that may not be borne out when the market opens and regular trading volumes are reached. For example, a stock that reports an earnings miss may be down significantly in pre-market trading but could reverse course and end the day higher in the regular session.\n* **Convenience**: This is a major benefit for the do-it-yourself investor because not everyone has a schedule that permits trading during regular market hours. The ability to start the day early and place trades in the pre-market is a big advantage for most people due to the frenzied pace of everyday life.\n* **Get a jump on the competition**: Astute traders and investors who are familiar with trading patterns and experienced in extended-hours trading may use the pre-market to buy or sell stocks at more favorable prices, compared to prices obtained by other traders in the regular session. This is only possible if the pre-market reaction to news about a stock is accurate, and the stock does not fully discount the news in pre-market trading. In such instances, a stock that trades higher in the pre-market will continue to trend significantly higher in the regular trading session, while a stock that trades lower in the pre-market will trend lower during regular trading.\n\n## Pre-Market Trading: Risks\n\nWe now turn to the risks of pre-market trading, which include:\n\n* **Limited liquidity and wide bid-ask spreads**: The number of buyers and sellers of stocks is far fewer in the pre-market, compared with the multitudes of traders and investors during regular trading. As a result, pre-market trading volumes are generally a fraction of volumes in the regular session. Low trading volumes result in limited liquidity, greater volatility, and wide bid-ask spreads.\n* **Price uncertainty**: Prices of stocks traded in the pre-market may diverge significantly from the prices of those stocks during regular hours. Apart from the impact on stock prices from vastly differing trading volumes in pre-market and regular sessions, pre-market stock prices may only reflect prices from a single or handful of electronic communication networks (ECNs). During regular trading hours, multiple exchanges, ECNs, and market makers provide stock prices, leading to better [price discovery](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricediscovery.asp); the stock quotes shown are consolidated and represent the best bid and offer across all trading venues.\n* **Limit orders may result in non-execution**: Many brokerages only accept limit orders in extended-hours trading, so as to protect investors from unexpectedly adverse prices. Limit orders can only be executed at the limit price or better. The benefit of this feature of limit orders means that the investor knows the highest price at which a stock will be bought or the lowest price at which it will be sold. But this also means that if the market moves away from the limit price, the order will not be executed.\n* **Competition from institutional traders**: Retail traders face an uneven playing field in pre-market trading because many of the participants are institutional and professional traders who have a trading edge on account of much deeper pockets and access to better, more timely information.1\n\nThese risks mean that only experienced traders should consider trading in the pre-market because the odds are stacked against retail traders. Seasoned traders have the knowledge and experience to gauge the many nuances that make trading a challenge—such as assessing whether the pre-market reaction to the news is an under-reaction or over-reaction—and taking decisive action on trading matters like opening a new stock position or closing an existing one, setting limit prices at certain levels for buys and sells, etc.\n\n## When Does Pre-Market Trading Begin?\n\nPre-market trading can start as early as 4 a.m. EST, although most of it takes place from 8 a.m. EST and before regular trading commences at 9:30 a.m. EST.54\n\n## What Securities Can Be Traded in the Pre-Market Session? Options?\n\nGenerally, only listed stocks can be traded in the pre-market session. Not all stocks, though. Stocks such as those that have a limited float or are not widely held, or small-cap stocks, may not have sufficient volumes to make pre-market trading a viable proposition. Options cannot be traded in the pre-market session.\n\n## Do Online Brokers Offer Pre-Market Trading?\n\nAlmost all online brokers offer pre-market trading, although the hours differ from one broker to the other. Here's a sample of pre-market trading hours at select online brokers as of Dec. 21, 2021 (note that these hours may be subject to change):\n\n* TD Ameritrade offers pre-market trading from 7 a.m. EST to 9:28 a.m. EST.6\n* At Charles Schwab, pre-market orders can be placed between 8:05 p.m. (on the previous trading day) and 9:25 a.m. EST, and are eligible for execution between 7 a.m. and 9:25 a.m. EST.7\n* E\\*TRADE offers pre-market trading from 7 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST.8\n* Interactive Brokers has pre-trading for its \"IBKR Pro\" accounts from 4 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST, and for its \"IBKR Lite\" accounts from 7 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST.9\n* At Robinhood, the pre-market trading session is from 9 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST; trades may still be executed as early as 8:58 a.m. EST.10\n* Webull allows pre-market trading from 4 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST.11\n\n## Can a Limit Order From Pre-Market Trading Carry Over into the Regular Session?\n\nIn most cases, limit orders from pre-market trading are only valid for that particular session and if not executed, do not carry over into the regular session. However, Interactive Brokers permits limit- or stop-limit-type orders that can be active in all trading sessions including pre-market, regular trading hours (RTH), and after-market; for such orders, the attribute \"Allow Outside RTH\" needs to be added.9\n\n## Why Are Extended Trading Hours Necessary?\n\nExtended trading hours enable investors to react to news and events when the markets are closed. It is also a convenient way to trade for people who cannot buy and sell securities during the regular trading session.\n\n## What Is the Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator?\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator is calculated based on the last sale of Nasdaq-100 securities during the pre-market trading period of 8:15 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. EST. For Nasdaq-100 securities that do not trade in the pre-market, the calculation uses the last sale from the previous day's 4 p.m. closing price. The Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator and After Hours Indicator are useful gauges of market sentiment during extended trading hours.12\n\n## Is 24-Hour Trading for Stocks Going to Be a Reality Soon?\n\nThe 24-hour trading that is a feature of the foreign exchange and cryptocurrency markets may come to equity markets within the next few years. 24 Exchange, a Bermuda-based crypto and foreign exchange trading platform, aims to bring the round-the-clock trading of the digital currency realm to the stock market. In October 2021, 24 Exchange filed forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission in hopes of receiving a license to commence operating a 24-hour exchange in 2022.", "timestamp": 1655171219, "digest": "_5tAKxd0GF2KsR6U8lFu5aYUwBlJuvfqNBpZKeBP6BQ", "contributor": "0xC655E66A835cAF725E11A6bBE32dDB510BE97acD"}

This method requires producers to forecast demand accurately.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that minimizes inventory and increases efficiency.\n* Just-in-time manufacturing is also known as the Toyota Production System (TPS) because the car manufacturer Toyota adopted the system in the 1970s.\n* Kanban is a scheduling system often used in conjunction with JIT to avoid overcapacity of work in process.\n* The success of the JIT production process relies on steady production, high-quality workmanship, no machine breakdowns, and reliable suppliers.\n* The terms short-cycle manufacturing, used by Motorola, and continuous-flow manufacturing, used by IBM, are synonymous with the JIT system.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 46 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:46\n\n#### Just In Time\n\n## How Does Just-in-Time Inventory Work?\n\nThe just-in-time (JIT) inventory system minimizes inventory and increases efficiency. JIT production systems cut inventory costs because manufacturers receive materials and parts as needed for production and do not have to pay storage costs. Manufacturers are also not left with unwanted inventory if an order is canceled or not fulfilled.\n\nOne example of a JIT inventory system is a car manufacturer that operates with low inventory levels but heavily relies on its supply chain to deliver the parts it requires to build cars on an as-needed basis. Consequently, the manufacturer orders the parts required to assemble the vehicles only after an order is received.\n\nFor JIT manufacturing to succeed, companies must have steady production, high-quality workmanship, glitch-free plant machinery, and reliable suppliers.\n\n### \n\n*The JIT inventory system contrasts with [just-in-case](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp) strategies, where producers hold sufficient inventories to have enough products to absorb maximum market demand.*\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of JIT\n\nJIT inventory systems have several advantages over traditional models. Production runs are short, which means that manufacturers can quickly move from one product to another. Also, this method reduces costs by minimizing warehouse needs. Companies also spend less money on [raw materials](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp) because they buy just enough resources to make the ordered products and no more.\n\nThe disadvantages of JIT inventory systems involve potential disruptions in the supply chain. If a raw-materials supplier has a breakdown and cannot deliver the goods promptly, this could conceivably stall the entire production line. A sudden unexpected order for goods may delay the delivery of finished products to end clients.\n\n## Example of JIT\n\nFamous for its JIT inventory system, Toyota Motor Corporation orders parts only when it receives new car orders. Although the company installed this method in the 1970s, it took 20 years to perfect it.\n\nSadly, Toyota's JIT inventory system nearly caused the company to come to a screeching halt in February 1997, after a fire at Japanese-owned automotive parts supplier Aisin decimated its capacity to produce P-valves for Toyota's vehicles. Because Aisin is the sole supplier of this part, its weeks-long shutdown caused Toyota to halt production for several days. This caused a ripple effect, where other Toyota parts suppliers likewise had to temporarily shut down because the automaker had no need for their parts during that time period. Consequently, this fire cost Toyota 160 billion yen in revenue.1\n\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effect on the economy and supply chain, things like paper surgical masks, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer experienced disruption. This was because inputs from overseas factories and warehouses could not be delivered in time to meet the surge in demand caused by the pandemic.2\n\n## Special Considerations\n\n[Kanban](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kanban.asp) is a Japanese scheduling system that's often used in conjunction with lean manufacturing and JIT. Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiency.3\n\nThe Kanban system highlights problem areas by measuring lead and cycle times across the production process, which helps identify upper limits for work-in-process inventory to avoid overcapacity.\n\n## What Exactly Do You Mean by Just-in-Time?\n\nA just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that has a company receive goods as close as possible to when they are actually needed. So, if a car assembly plant needs to install airbags, it does not keep a stock of airbags on its shelves but receives them as those cars come onto the assembly line.\n\n## Doesn't This Sound a Bit Risky? What If Things Don't Arrive in Time?\n\nA chief benefit of a JIT system is that it minimizes the need for a company to store large quantities of inventory, which improves efficiency and provides substantial cost savings. However, if there is a supply or demand shock, it can bring everything to a halt.\n\nFor instance, at the beginning of the 2020's economic crisis, everything from ventilators to surgical masks experienced disruption as inputs from overseas could not reach their destinations in time to meet a surge in demand.2\n\n## What Types of Companies Use JIT?\n\nThe JIT inventory system is popular with [small businesses and major corporations alike](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051215/what-are-some-examples-just-time-jit-inventory-processes.asp) because it enhances cash flow and reduces the capital needed to run the business. Retailers, restaurants, on-demand publishing, tech manufacturing, and automobile manufacturing are examples of industries that have benefited from just-in-time inventory.\n\n## Who Invented JIT Inventory Management?\n\nJIT is attributed to the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. Executives at Toyota in the 1970s reasoned that the company could adapt more quickly and efficiently to changes in trends or demands for model changes if it did not keep any more inventory in-store than was immediately needed.3\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstq-4jbgjqIlCwoSqETIQDNJwGoD5dx8wAkdniV_bu6ddDrnqnsRm2-5Ju8YoZMBlzT_gKBPuuZgOdSBR-_SZQHwZ9UcqF9vNlxFpMpEXZDXYKVaIM_7skJ9hHoFOjbbvjc837y0UOdt-TAGFxvehUA-BHhFjRxhO6yuCtUN9gGcWyibEHbGEnRzHOpnLZgoNsjakEiVgKk13tgXQmfcKPJqtblhMI9R8iMalbIDdaX9gxNPqkTewSohMwxUGk-68lf70wSRWSaINPKR9ITHkl4zTC2WmLMI_qjebipUDytZkWz2ARhM7c9ziP01trqkXp6sLRMse0tR4dmdfC92JgJuJwnlpqWmGWFhu9u5iqlCvo&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEvHBLR8Xy-dEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstq-4jbgjqIlCwoSqETIQDNJwGoD5dx8wAkdniV_bu6ddDrnqnsRm2-5Ju8YoZMBlzT_gKBPuuZgOdSBR-_SZQHwZ9UcqF9vNlxFpMpEXZDXYKVaIM_7skJ9hHoFOjbbvjc837y0UOdt-TAGFxvehUA-BHhFjRxhO6yuCtUN9gGcWyibEHbGEnRzHOpnLZgoNsjakEiVgKk13tgXQmfcKPJqtblhMI9R8iMalbIDdaX9gxNPqkTewSohMwxUGk-68lf70wSRWSaINPKR9ITHkl4zTC2WmLMI_qjebipUDytZkWz2ARhM7c9ziP01trqkXp6sLRMse0tR4dmdfC92JgJuJwnlpqWmGWFhu9u5iqlCvo&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEvHBLR8Xy-dEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

In 2012, we had more than 120 top game projects worldwide on three quarters of iOS and PlayStation. Today, we have more than 160 projects worldwide, covering 95% of Web3 and open metaverse!\n\nLet's take a look back at the years of Concept Art House.\n\nSince 2007, Concept Art House (CAH) has provided art and support for many of the top gaming and entertainment companies in the world and has shipped over 1000 games and collectibles with the world's most influential brands. With those deep roots in gaming, including franchises such as ROBLOX and Fortnite, CAH has evolved to focus solely on NFTs and has successfully pivoted to play a major role in the creation of Web3 and the metaverse ecosystem. To that end, CAH has created NFTs for Frank Miller's Sin City, UFC, International Olympics Committee (IOC), the NFL and Gucci. CAH is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Shanghai and Chengdu and its partners and investors include Dapper Labs, Gala Games and Animoca Brands.\n\nAs our founder and CEO, James Zhang is also the soul of our team. In addition to being an entrepreneur, he has worked as an executive of world-renowned companies, an artist and a developer. With over 20 years of rich experience, he has led our team to today with a forward-looking vision.\n\nWhat’s more, there are other outstanding team members include Jenny Chen, the Vice Chair of SFOX and adviser to Warburg Pincus. Many others with years of experience in the crypto or art fields are working with us.\n\nConcept Art House is the world's first true NFT publisher, and we are bridging the gap between digital equity brands and fans who loveNFT. When AAA works of art enter the NFT market, it will destroy the value of the IP itself if given to a low-quality team. As a professional NFT production team, all the works produced so far are AAA level, and the team understands the innovative use of NFT, and also has a good understanding of game development due to the cooperation with game companies for more than ten years. At the same time, we also have our loyal fans in the community, who recognize the high quality of NFT produced by us. We will let our fans know more worthwhile and durable NFT through the regular release of articles.\n\nAs the name suggests, Concept Art House is a major supplier of high-quality concept design, which is a process of continuous evolution from scratch before the finished product is presented. For example, the original game art, story set, character set, these are part of the concept design. The ultimate goal is to present a complete world value in the work.\n\nEvery initial idea handed to Concept Art House goes through thinking, composition, discussion, selection, decision, implementation and modification. Together with many brands, they witness the birth of finished products. Every detail of the work requires the team to think deeply whether it conforms to the logic of the product background and insight into the follow-up reaction of consumers, then conduct pre-sales marketing of products.\n\nNFT design shoulders the important mission of promoting the progress of the world. Of all the NFT designed by Crypto Art House, we bring more people-oriented, caring, social, environmental and market relations. Thus consumers can feel the story background of different NFT while collecting, and at the same time meet customer requirements and create economic value.\n\n\"We believe that Concept Art House will continue to be a creative powerhouse in the digital content and NFT arena, which we know first hand from our working relationship and collaboration on many exciting projects including our upcoming UFC digital collectibles experience launching on Flow.\" Roham Gharegozlou, the CEO of Dapper Labs commented.\n\nUnconsciously, it is surprising to see Concept Art House has been going on for so long. Looking back on the journey, we are full of gratitude, and excited when we see the direction of our progress! Let's move on together.\n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1655171173, "digest": "_ab_rxZxm338GY1O0fK5hyZyFHkkn4UU8HyxAFN1mUw", "contributor": "0x5BCEFD7FadDFfc1B9259534075305Fd11d61C8FA"}

All C22 pass holders can view the livestream from the Consensus Official App or online through the Consensus agenda.\n\nThe complex choreography of wallet identity checks and payment exchanges will keep CoinDesk's social token DESK circulating among an expected crowd of more than 15,000 attendees when Consensus 2022 starts on Thursday\n\n\"This is probably the biggest test in crypto media to date.”Jenil Thakker, CEO of Coinvise, a startup that builds tokenization and community experiences for brands including CoinDesk said. “No organization of CoinDesk's scale has ever done this before.”\n\nCoinDesk is relaunching DESK for this year's Consensus,which is the first face-to-face meeting of this media and events company since 2019. It aims to bring conference attendees proficient in cryptocurrency closer to the brand while also getting a hands-on experience with the technology.\n\nCoinDesk's value proposition to DESK holders is similar to the Disney dollar: it's valuable in the brand ecosystem, but worthless anywhere else. Like air miles, it rewards loyal users in a different way to earn internal perks. Unlike air miles, it exists on a public blockchain. The transaction is irreversible and beyond the issuer's control. CoinDesk itself sees DESK as a high stake. It implies the potential integration inside and outside the site in the future. For now, of course, the focus is Consensus 2022.\n\nWhether you are a crypto beginner or an expert, Consensus will bring you the best experience. So don't miss this event, come and join the Concept Art House!\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1655171262, "digest": "ddSsd7SNb-ikICADVXZy9GakRp9zsTfIxakcq8oELP0", "contributor": "0x5BCEFD7FadDFfc1B9259534075305Fd11d61C8FA"}
{"id": "tLV6LCLw2Ss9t8LD8DV32zLlxqjQG_RxbMEJ35U2_gs", "title": "Pre-Market Trading", "body": "## What Is Pre-Market Trading?\n\nPre-market trading is the period of trading activity that occurs before the regular market session. The pre-market [trading session](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingsession.asp) typically occurs between 8 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. EST each trading day. Many investors and [traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) watch the pre-market trading activity to judge the strength and direction of the market in anticipation of the regular trading session.\n\nPre-market trading can only be executed with limited orders through an \"electronic market\" like an alternative trading system (ATS) or [electronic communication network (ECN)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecn.asp). Market makers are not permitted to execute orders until the 9:30 a.m. EST opening bell.1\n\n## Understanding Pre-Market Trading\n\nPre-market trading activity generally has limited volume and liquidity; therefore, large [bid-ask spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) are common.1 Many retail brokers offer pre-market trading but may limit the types of orders that can be made during the pre-market period. Several [direct-access brokers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directaccessbroker.asp) allow access to pre-market trading to commence as early as 4 a.m. EST from Monday through Friday.\n\nIt is important to remember there is very little activity for most stocks so early in the morning unless there is news. The liquidity is also extremely thin, with most stocks only showing [stub quotes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stub-quote.asp). Index-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ([SPY](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=SPY)), have moving quotes due to the trading in the S&P 500 futures contracts. Many of the most widely held [top holdings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/top-holdings.asp) in benchmark indices may also get movement in the event of a significant gap up or down in the S&P 500 futures. Large-cap, widely held stocks such as Apple Inc. ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)) tend to get trades as early as 4:15 a.m. EST.2\n\n[After-hours trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/afterhourstrading.asp) was introduced before pre-market trading. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) introduced after-hours trading in June 1991 by extending trading hours by an hour. The move was a response to increased competition from international exchanges in London and Tokyo and private exchanges, which offered more hours of trading, and 2.24 million shares changed hands in two sessions of trading.3 Over the years, as exchanges became increasingly computerized and the Internet's reach spread across borders, NYSE began extending the number of hours of trading available for trading, eventually allowing pre-market trading between the hours of 4 a.m. and 9:30 a.m.4\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Pre-market trading is trading that occurs between 4 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. EST.\n* Pre-market trading is characterized by thin liquidity, low trading volumes, and large bid-ask spreads.\n\n## Pre-Market Trading: Benefits\n\nPre-market trading and after-hours trading—collectively known as extended-hours trading—share similar benefits and risks. Let's look at the benefits first:\n\n* **Provides an opportunity to react early to overnight news**: Pre-market trading provides the retail investor with an opportunity to react to overnight news before the regular trading session commences. Such news could be corporate earnings (although most companies report earnings after markets close, rather than before the open) or a major company announcement, overnight breaking news such as a geopolitical development, or news emanating from overseas markets. The caveat here is that the pre-market reaction to such news may reverse in the regular trading session. The limited trading volume in the pre-market may provide a signal of weakness or strength that may not be borne out when the market opens and regular trading volumes are reached. For example, a stock that reports an earnings miss may be down significantly in pre-market trading but could reverse course and end the day higher in the regular session.\n* **Convenience**: This is a major benefit for the do-it-yourself investor because not everyone has a schedule that permits trading during regular market hours. The ability to start the day early and place trades in the pre-market is a big advantage for most people due to the frenzied pace of everyday life.\n* **Get a jump on the competition**: Astute traders and investors who are familiar with trading patterns and experienced in extended-hours trading may use the pre-market to buy or sell stocks at more favorable prices, compared to prices obtained by other traders in the regular session. This is only possible if the pre-market reaction to news about a stock is accurate, and the stock does not fully discount the news in pre-market trading. In such instances, a stock that trades higher in the pre-market will continue to trend significantly higher in the regular trading session, while a stock that trades lower in the pre-market will trend lower during regular trading.\n\n## Pre-Market Trading: Risks\n\nWe now turn to the risks of pre-market trading, which include:\n\n* **Limited liquidity and wide bid-ask spreads**: The number of buyers and sellers of stocks is far fewer in the pre-market, compared with the multitudes of traders and investors during regular trading. As a result, pre-market trading volumes are generally a fraction of volumes in the regular session. Low trading volumes result in limited liquidity, greater volatility, and wide bid-ask spreads.\n* **Price uncertainty**: Prices of stocks traded in the pre-market may diverge significantly from the prices of those stocks during regular hours. Apart from the impact on stock prices from vastly differing trading volumes in pre-market and regular sessions, pre-market stock prices may only reflect prices from a single or handful of electronic communication networks (ECNs). During regular trading hours, multiple exchanges, ECNs, and market makers provide stock prices, leading to better [price discovery](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricediscovery.asp); the stock quotes shown are consolidated and represent the best bid and offer across all trading venues.\n* **Limit orders may result in non-execution**: Many brokerages only accept limit orders in extended-hours trading, so as to protect investors from unexpectedly adverse prices. Limit orders can only be executed at the limit price or better. The benefit of this feature of limit orders means that the investor knows the highest price at which a stock will be bought or the lowest price at which it will be sold. But this also means that if the market moves away from the limit price, the order will not be executed.\n* **Competition from institutional traders**: Retail traders face an uneven playing field in pre-market trading because many of the participants are institutional and professional traders who have a trading edge on account of much deeper pockets and access to better, more timely information.1\n\nThese risks mean that only experienced traders should consider trading in the pre-market because the odds are stacked against retail traders. Seasoned traders have the knowledge and experience to gauge the many nuances that make trading a challenge—such as assessing whether the pre-market reaction to the news is an under-reaction or over-reaction—and taking decisive action on trading matters like opening a new stock position or closing an existing one, setting limit prices at certain levels for buys and sells, etc.\n\n## When Does Pre-Market Trading Begin?\n\nPre-market trading can start as early as 4 a.m. EST, although most of it takes place from 8 a.m. EST and before regular trading commences at 9:30 a.m. EST.54\n\n## What Securities Can Be Traded in the Pre-Market Session? Options?\n\nGenerally, only listed stocks can be traded in the pre-market session. Not all stocks, though. Stocks such as those that have a limited float or are not widely held, or small-cap stocks, may not have sufficient volumes to make pre-market trading a viable proposition. Options cannot be traded in the pre-market session.\n\n## Do Online Brokers Offer Pre-Market Trading?\n\nAlmost all online brokers offer pre-market trading, although the hours differ from one broker to the other. Here's a sample of pre-market trading hours at select online brokers as of Dec. 21, 2021 (note that these hours may be subject to change):\n\n* TD Ameritrade offers pre-market trading from 7 a.m. EST to 9:28 a.m. EST.6\n* At Charles Schwab, pre-market orders can be placed between 8:05 p.m. (on the previous trading day) and 9:25 a.m. EST, and are eligible for execution between 7 a.m. and 9:25 a.m. EST.7\n* E\\*TRADE offers pre-market trading from 7 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST.8\n* Interactive Brokers has pre-trading for its \"IBKR Pro\" accounts from 4 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST, and for its \"IBKR Lite\" accounts from 7 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST.9\n* At Robinhood, the pre-market trading session is from 9 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST; trades may still be executed as early as 8:58 a.m. EST.10\n* Webull allows pre-market trading from 4 a.m. EST to 9:30 a.m. EST.11\n\n## Can a Limit Order From Pre-Market Trading Carry Over into the Regular Session?\n\nIn most cases, limit orders from pre-market trading are only valid for that particular session and if not executed, do not carry over into the regular session. However, Interactive Brokers permits limit- or stop-limit-type orders that can be active in all trading sessions including pre-market, regular trading hours (RTH), and after-market; for such orders, the attribute \"Allow Outside RTH\" needs to be added.9\n\n## Why Are Extended Trading Hours Necessary?\n\nExtended trading hours enable investors to react to news and events when the markets are closed. It is also a convenient way to trade for people who cannot buy and sell securities during the regular trading session.\n\n## What Is the Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator?\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator is calculated based on the last sale of Nasdaq-100 securities during the pre-market trading period of 8:15 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. EST. For Nasdaq-100 securities that do not trade in the pre-market, the calculation uses the last sale from the previous day's 4 p.m. closing price. The Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator and After Hours Indicator are useful gauges of market sentiment during extended trading hours.12\n\n## Is 24-Hour Trading for Stocks Going to Be a Reality Soon?\n\nThe 24-hour trading that is a feature of the foreign exchange and cryptocurrency markets may come to equity markets within the next few years. 24 Exchange, a Bermuda-based crypto and foreign exchange trading platform, aims to bring the round-the-clock trading of the digital currency realm to the stock market. In October 2021, 24 Exchange filed forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission in hopes of receiving a license to commence operating a 24-hour exchange in 2022.", "timestamp": 1655171283, "digest": "P_PwBF_2URiAQDuorvja1vnswC-rF3Rdzr6aOdiZGEM", "contributor": "0x71a35C1f554Eb1419099081bC44D58Cd4A8F7564"}

In 2012, we had more than 120 top game projects worldwide on three quarters of iOS and PlayStation. Today, we have more than 160 projects worldwide, covering 95% of Web3 and open metaverse!\n\nLet's take a look back at the years of Concept Art House.\n\nSince 2007, Concept Art House (CAH) has provided art and support for many of the top gaming and entertainment companies in the world and has shipped over 1000 games and collectibles with the world's most influential brands. With those deep roots in gaming, including franchises such as ROBLOX and Fortnite, CAH has evolved to focus solely on NFTs and has successfully pivoted to play a major role in the creation of Web3 and the metaverse ecosystem. To that end, CAH has created NFTs for Frank Miller's Sin City, UFC, International Olympics Committee (IOC), the NFL and Gucci. CAH is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Shanghai and Chengdu and its partners and investors include Dapper Labs, Gala Games and Animoca Brands.\n\nAs our founder and CEO, James Zhang is also the soul of our team. In addition to being an entrepreneur, he has worked as an executive of world-renowned companies, an artist and a developer. With over 20 years of rich experience, he has led our team to today with a forward-looking vision.\n\nWhat’s more, there are other outstanding team members include Jenny Chen, the Vice Chair of SFOX and adviser to Warburg Pincus. Many others with years of experience in the crypto or art fields are working with us.\n\nConcept Art House is the world's first true NFT publisher, and we are bridging the gap between digital equity brands and fans who loveNFT. When AAA works of art enter the NFT market, it will destroy the value of the IP itself if given to a low-quality team. As a professional NFT production team, all the works produced so far are AAA level, and the team understands the innovative use of NFT, and also has a good understanding of game development due to the cooperation with game companies for more than ten years. At the same time, we also have our loyal fans in the community, who recognize the high quality of NFT produced by us. We will let our fans know more worthwhile and durable NFT through the regular release of articles.\n\nAs the name suggests, Concept Art House is a major supplier of high-quality concept design, which is a process of continuous evolution from scratch before the finished product is presented. For example, the original game art, story set, character set, these are part of the concept design. The ultimate goal is to present a complete world value in the work.\n\nEvery initial idea handed to Concept Art House goes through thinking, composition, discussion, selection, decision, implementation and modification. Together with many brands, they witness the birth of finished products. Every detail of the work requires the team to think deeply whether it conforms to the logic of the product background and insight into the follow-up reaction of consumers, then conduct pre-sales marketing of products.\n\nNFT design shoulders the important mission of promoting the progress of the world. Of all the NFT designed by Crypto Art House, we bring more people-oriented, caring, social, environmental and market relations. Thus consumers can feel the story background of different NFT while collecting, and at the same time meet customer requirements and create economic value.\n\n\"We believe that Concept Art House will continue to be a creative powerhouse in the digital content and NFT arena, which we know first hand from our working relationship and collaboration on many exciting projects including our upcoming UFC digital collectibles experience launching on Flow.\" Roham Gharegozlou, the CEO of Dapper Labs commented.\n\nUnconsciously, it is surprising to see Concept Art House has been going on for so long. Looking back on the journey, we are full of gratitude, and excited when we see the direction of our progress! Let's move on together.\n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1655171182, "digest": "_ab_rxZxm338GY1O0fK5hyZyFHkkn4UU8HyxAFN1mUw", "contributor": "0x5BCEFD7FadDFfc1B9259534075305Fd11d61C8FA"}

The idea is that everyone has a stake in the company's success and everyone should strive, at all times, to help make the [business model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp) better.\n\nMany companies have adopted the kaizen concept. Most notably, [Toyota](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/021416/how-toyota-makes-money-tm.asp) employs the kaizen philosophy within its organization and has esteemed it as one of its core values. Within its production system, Toyota encourages and empowers all employees to identify areas of potential improvement and create viable solutions.1\n\n### Fast Fact\n\n*Toyota’s process of identifying solutions is called \"kaizen blitz.\"*\n\n## Requirements for Kaizen\n\nKaizen consists of five key principles including: know your customer, let it flow, go to gemba (or 'the real place'), empower people and be transparent.2 These five principles lead to three major outcomes: elimination of waste (also referred to as [economic efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_efficiency.asp)), good housekeeping, and standardization. Ideally, kaizen becomes so ingrained in a [company's culture](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-culture.asp) that it eventually becomes natural to employees.\n\nThe kaizen concept posits that there is no perfect end and that everything can be improved upon. People must strive to evolve and innovate constantly. The basic principle of kaizen is that people who perform certain tasks and activities are the most knowledgeable about that task/activity; including them to effect change is the best strategy for improvement.3\n\nTeamwork is core to kaizen, where regular team meetings are held involving discussions about improvements, changes, and projects.\n\n## Kaizen and the PDCA Cycle\n\nImprovements generally follow the [PDCA cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pdca-cycle.asp) format, which stands for \"plan-do-check-act.\" The \"plan\" portion includes mapping out the changes so that everyone knows what to expect when teams try to solve a problem. The \"do\" means implementing the best solution to the problem. The \"check\" step involves evaluating the solution to the problem to see if it worked.\n\nWhen a company performs the \"act\" stage, it determines whether or not the solution should become a company standard or if it needs further changes. If managers decide to implement more changes, kaizen goes back to the plan step and the process starts over.\n\n## Just-in-Time Inventory Strategy\n\nOne of the key goals of kaizen is to reduce waste and increase efficiency in the production cycle. A [just-in-time (JIT)](https://www.kaizen.com/what-is-kaizen) inventory strategy allows management to minimize excess inventory by matching the delivery of raw materials from suppliers with production schedules. Also known as the Toyota Production System (TPS), for the company that popularized the strategy, JIT helps companies cut costs because manufacturers do not have to pay [inventory carrying costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carrying-costs.asp). It also reduces waste because companies are not left with extra inventory should a customer cancel or postpone an order.3\n\n[Kanban](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kanban.asp) is an inventory control system used in conjunction with a JIT strategy. It provides employees with visual cues that tell them it is time to order parts and materials as they run out. The system relies on colored cards that track production and alert employees that it's time to replenish a needed part or material. It enables employees to quickly order the correct amount of parts from the supplier and have them delivered to where they are needed in the factory. The goal of kanban is to ensure the efficient running of the factory assembly line and to prevent [bottlenecks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottleneck.asp) from occurring.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsveg2mEkiIjd0AUG7kWIt5nxOCP5ah-UvwwRFHnt-icXML7yRPER9a0w5NAWXaecw-cAr7GDQSvQrYwEVhx62-0Bl3GPaQUwlgUXeM9TF49sWpDuL_PZmVesxrqKoasN-vHVJ9PP51iw15ZJP8Coy6C6SZ8OEktHGEZpNDMxoUPm82WnAPQV3gzjTG-2VCiaiS_GBfSR1LPmCHgr0c-ZTWCXKbnArMJjcWJY941KFAPVwI09pLSV__5T20JY1bCIebWnOs2ZkWWQoNOZMwoYWC24wlsec2cWtEc8o9_CFROMOB5ztlYyUAX5cX4VrTr6P7n2mNlu4WAZo_V5gW2lZ7Nlb_CpRad_U1GW_aC&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMtnScDAMtPDEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

{"id": "11vYPINnWB9zz82iGZf38WsiMDxAhycrOkxNxgXBWEs", "title": "Keynesian Economics", "body": "## What Is Keynesian Economics?\n\nKeynesian economics is a macroeconomic economic theory of total spending in the economy and its effects on output, employment, and[ inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp). Keynesian economics was developed by the British[ economist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp)[ John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) during the 1930s in an attempt to understand the[ Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp). Keynesian economics is considered a \"demand-side\" theory that focuses on changes in the economy over the short run. Keynes’s theory was the first to sharply separate the study of economic behavior and markets based on individual incentives from the study of broad national economic aggregate variables and constructs.1 \n\nBased on his theory, Keynes advocated for increased government expenditures and lower taxes to stimulate demand and pull the global economy out of the depression. Subsequently, Keynesian economics was used to refer to the concept that optimal economic performance could be achieved—and economic[ slumps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slump.asp) prevented—by influencing[ aggregate demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp) through activist stabilization and economic intervention policies by the government.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Keynesian economics focuses on using active government policy to manage aggregate demand in order to address or prevent economic recessions.\n* Keynes developed his theories in response to the Great Depression, and was highly critical of previous economic theories, which he referred to as “classical economics”. \n* Activist fiscal and monetary policy are the primary tools recommended by Keynesian economists to manage the economy and fight unemployment.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 40 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:40\n\n#### Keynesian Economics\n\n## Understanding Keynesian Economics\n\nKeynesian economics represented a new way of looking at spending, output, and inflation. Previously,[ what Keynes dubbed classical economic thinking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/classicaleconomics.asp) held that cyclical swings in employment and economic output create profit opportunities that individuals and entrepreneurs would have an incentive to pursue, and in so doing correct the imbalances in the economy. According to Keynes’s construction of this so-called classical theory, if aggregate demand in the economy fell, the resulting weakness in production and jobs would precipitate a decline in prices and wages. A lower level of inflation and wages would induce employers to make capital investments and employ more people, stimulating employment and restoring[ economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp). Keynes believed that the depth and persistence of the Great Depression, however, severely tested this hypothesis.\n\nIn his book, *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* and other works, Keynes argued against his construction of classical theory, that during recessions business pessimism and certain characteristics of market economies would exacerbate economic weakness and cause aggregate demand to plunge further.2\n\nFor example, Keynesian economics disputes the notion held by some economists that lower wages can restore[ full employment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp) because labor demand curves slope downward like any other normal demand curve. Instead he argued that employers will not add employees to produce goods that cannot be sold because demand for their products is weak. Similarly, poor business conditions may cause companies to reduce[ capital investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-investment.asp), rather than take advantage of lower prices to invest in new plants and equipment. This would also have the effect of reducing overall expenditures and employment. \n\n## Keynesian Economics and the Great Depression\n\nKeynesian economics is sometimes referred to as \"depression economics,\" as Keynes's *General Theory* was written during a time of deep depression not only in his native land of the United Kingdom but worldwide. The famous 1936 book was informed by Keynes’s understanding of events arising during the Great Depression, which Keynes believed could not be explained by classical economic theory as he portrayed it in his book.\n\nOther economists had argued that in the wake of any widespread downturn in the economy, businesses and investors taking advantage of lower input prices in pursuit of their own self-interest would return output and prices to a state of[ equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-equilibrium.asp), unless otherwise prevented from doing so. Keynes believed that the Great Depression seemed to counter this theory. Output was low and unemployment remained high during this time. The Great Depression inspired Keynes to think differently about the nature of the economy. From these theories, he established real-world applications that could have implications for a society in economic crisis.\n\nKeynes rejected the idea that the economy would return to a natural state of equilibrium. Instead, he argued that once an economic downturn sets in, for whatever reason, the fear and gloom that it engenders among businesses and investors will tend to become self-fulfilling and can lead to a sustained period of depressed economic activity and unemployment. In response to this, Keynes advocated a countercyclical fiscal policy in which, during periods of economic woe, the government should undertake[ deficit spending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit-spending.asp) to make up for the decline in investment and boost consumer spending in order to[ stabilize aggregate demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratchet-effect.asp).\n\nKeynes was highly critical of the British government at the time. The government greatly increased welfare spending and raised taxes to balance the national books. Keynes said this would not encourage people to spend their money, thereby leaving the economy unstimulated and unable to recover and return to a successful state. Instead, he proposed that the government spend more money and cut taxes to turn a budget deficit, which would increase consumer demand in the economy. This would, in turn, lead to an increase in overall economic activity and a reduction in unemployment.\n\nKeynes also criticized the idea of excessive saving, unless it was for a specific purpose such as retirement or education. He saw it as dangerous for the economy because the more money sitting stagnant, the less money in the economy stimulating growth. This was another of Keynes's theories geared toward preventing deep economic depressions.\n\nMany economists have criticized Keynes's approach. They argue that businesses responding to economic incentives will tend to return the economy to a state of equilibrium unless the government prevents them from doing so by interfering with prices and wages, making it appear as though the market is self-regulating. On the other hand, Keynes, who was writing while the world was mired in a period of deep economic depression, was not as optimistic about the natural equilibrium of the market. He believed the government was in a better position than market forces when it came to creating a robust economy.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes (Source: Public Domain).\n\n## Keynesian Economics and Fiscal Policy\n\nThe[ multiplier effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multipliereffect.asp), developed by Keynes’s student Richard Kahn, is one of the chief components of Keynesian countercyclical fiscal policy. According to Keynes's theory of fiscal stimulus, an injection of government spending eventually leads to added business activity and even more spending. This theory proposes that spending boosts aggregate output and generates more income. If workers are willing to spend their extra income, the resulting growth in the[ gross domestic product( GDP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) could be even greater than the initial stimulus amount.3\n\nThe magnitude of the Keynesian multiplier is directly related to the marginal propensity to consume. Its concept is simple. Spending from one consumer becomes income for a business that then spends on equipment, worker wages, energy, materials, purchased services, taxes and investor returns. That worker's income can then be spent and the cycle continues. Keynes and his followers believed individuals should save less and spend more, raising their[ marginal propensity to consume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalpropensitytoconsume.asp) to effect full employment and economic growth.\n\nIn this theory, one dollar spent in fiscal stimulus eventually creates more than one dollar in growth. This appeared to be a coup for government economists, who could provide justification for politically popular spending projects on a national scale.\n\nThis theory was the dominant paradigm in academic economics for decades. Eventually, other economists, such as[ Milton Friedman](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/milton-friedman.asp) and[ Murray Rothbard](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/murray-n-rothbard.asp), showed that the Keynesian model misrepresented the relationship between savings, investment, and economic growth.4 Many economists still rely on multiplier-generated models, although most acknowledge that fiscal stimulus is far less effective than the original multiplier model suggests.\n\nThe fiscal multiplier commonly associated with the Keynesian theory is one of two broad multipliers in economics. The other multiplier is known as the[ money multiplier](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multipliereffect.asp). This multiplier refers to the money-creation process that results from a system of fractional reserve banking. The money multiplier is less controversial than its Keynesian fiscal counterpart.\n\n## Keynesian Economics and Monetary Policy\n\nKeynesian economics focuses on demand-side solutions to recessionary periods. The intervention of government in economic processes is an important part of the Keynesian arsenal for battling unemployment, underemployment, and low economic demand. The emphasis on direct government intervention in the economy often places Keynesian theorists at odds with those who argue for limited government involvement in the markets. \n\nKeynesian theorists argue that economies do not stabilize themselves very quickly and require active intervention that boosts short-term demand in the economy. Wages and employment, they argue, are slower to respond to the needs of the market and require governmental intervention to stay on track. Furthermore they argue, prices also do not react quickly, and only gradually change when monetary policy interventions are made, giving rise to a branch of Keynesian economics known as Monetarism. \n\nIf prices are slow to change, this makes it possible to use money supply as a tool and change interest rates to encourage borrowing and lending. Lowering interest rates is one way governments can meaningfully intervene in economic systems, thereby encouraging consumption and investment spending. Short-term demand increases initiated by interest rate cuts reinvigorate the economic system and restore employment and demand for services. The new economic activity then feeds continued growth and employment. \n\nWithout intervention, Keynesian theorists believe, this cycle is disrupted and market growth becomes more unstable and prone to excessive fluctuation. Keeping interest rates low is an attempt to stimulate the economic cycle by encouraging businesses and individuals to borrow more money. They then spend the money they borrow. This new spending stimulates the economy. Lowering interest rates, however, does not always lead directly to economic improvement.\n\nMonetarist economists focus on managing the money supply and lower interest rates as a solution to economic woes, but they generally try to avoid the[ zero-bound](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-bound.asp) problem. As interest rates approach zero, stimulating the economy by lowering interest rates becomes less effective because it reduces the incentive to invest rather than simply hold money in cash or close substitutes like short term Treasuries. Interest rate manipulation may no longer be enough to generate new economic activity if it cannot spur investment, and the attempt at generating economic recovery may stall completely. This is a type of liquidity trap.\n\nWhen lowering interest rates fails to deliver results, Keynesian economists argue that other strategies must be employed, primarily fiscal policy. Other interventionist policies include direct control of the labor supply, changing tax rates to increase or decrease the money supply indirectly, changing monetary policy, or placing controls on the supply of goods and services until employment and demand are restored.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsu9PmUWcwRyjQGUjdAzhNAq3OwjuvHnv8nCHskwES76JBy8wN4Z-qwWvPDCapEQlroFAleQgvx3ZaVf1SG9HzVia1DivytX4MAZSseiCB7WjsWR9KAU1sEjWVfhbsVI_DUnyhhbR7sTzYtiSqY-C9FmXpliTfpkDVRow7yLWeQLmByCp-iFULW4yLod-u_M4FImiPHSFgTFA2fQw1h2nade0vxlSIB-Gmis4XIzRXwNiGZnWtap5Xq0kRacAqR61IZ8Z52kVBu44I-GbAPLaw5QfbgOugIatKEOUuls7KHMQno3foX85wTohUJs2_vZoqVKTbRWDQ3u-SGa&sig=Cg0ArKJSzHXVruLz_W9ZEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsu9PmUWcwRyjQGUjdAzhNAq3OwjuvHnv8nCHskwES76JBy8wN4Z-qwWvPDCapEQlroFAleQgvx3ZaVf1SG9HzVia1DivytX4MAZSseiCB7WjsWR9KAU1sEjWVfhbsVI_DUnyhhbR7sTzYtiSqY-C9FmXpliTfpkDVRow7yLWeQLmByCp-iFULW4yLod-u_M4FImiPHSFgTFA2fQw1h2nade0vxlSIB-Gmis4XIzRXwNiGZnWtap5Xq0kRacAqR61IZ8Z52kVBu44I-GbAPLaw5QfbgOugIatKEOUuls7KHMQno3foX85wTohUJs2_vZoqVKTbRWDQ3u-SGa&sig=Cg0ArKJSzHXVruLz_W9ZEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "1rNYCEBzFNRtKg5gCsX-nuK696byxlCaKR9x_YMxZIs", "title": "Keogh Plan", "body": "## What Is a Keogh Plan?\n\nA Keogh plan is a tax-deferred pension plan available to self-employed individuals or unincorporated businesses for retirement purposes. A Keogh plan can be set up as either a [defined-benefit plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedbenefitpensionplan.asp) or a [defined-contribution plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedcontributionplan.asp), though most plans are set as the latter. Contributions are generally tax-deductible up to a certain percentage of annual income, with applicable absolute limits in U.S. dollar terms, which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can change from year to year.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Keogh plans are tax-deferred pension plans—either defined-benefit or defined-contribution—used for retirement purposes by either self-employed individuals or unincorporated businesses, while independent contractors cannot use a Keogh plan.\n* Profit-sharing plans are one of the two types of Keogh plans that allow a business to contribute up to 100% of compensation, or $58,000 as of 2021.\n* Keogh plans have more administrative burdens and higher upkeep costs than Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) or 401(k) plans, but the contribution limits are higher, making Keogh plans a popular option for many high-income business owners.\n* Because current tax retirement laws do not set apart incorporated and self-employed plan sponsors, the term \"Keogh plan\" is rarely ever used.\n\n## Understanding the Keogh Plan\n\nKeogh plans are retirement plans for self-employed people and unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. If an individual is an independent contractor, they cannot set up and use a Keogh plan for retirement.\n\nThe IRS refers to Keogh plans as qualified plans, and they come in two types: defined-contribution  plans, which include profit-sharing plans and money purchase plans, and defined-benefit plans, also known as HR(10) plans. Keogh plans can invest in the same set of securities as 401(k)s and IRAs, including stocks, bonds, [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) (CDs), and [annuities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity.asp).\n\n## Types of Keogh Plans\n\n### Qualified Defined-Contribution Plans\n\nKeogh plans can be set up as qualified defined-contribution plans, in which the contributions are made on a regular basis up to a limit. [Profit-sharing plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitsharingplan.asp) are one of the two types of Keogh plans that allow a business to contribute up to 100% of compensation, or $58,000 as of 2021, according to the IRS.1﻿ A business does not have to generate profits to set aside money for this type of plan.\n\n[Money purchase plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneypurchasepensionplan.asp) are less flexible compared to profit-sharing plans and require a business to contribute a fixed percentage of its income every year that is specified in plan documents. If a business alters its fixed percentage, it may face penalties. The [contribution limit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/choosing-a-retirement-plan-money-purchase-plan) for 2021 for money purchase plans is set at 25% of annual compensation or $58,000 ($57,000 for 2020), whichever is lower.1﻿\n\n### Qualified Defined-Benefit Plans\n\nQualified defined-benefit plans state the annual benefits to be received at retirement, and these benefits are typically based on salary and years of employment. Contributions towards defined-benefit Keogh plans are based on stated benefits and other factors, such as age and expected returns on plan assets. For 2021, the [maximum annual benefit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-defined-benefit-plan-benefit-limits) was set at $230,000 or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever is lower.1﻿\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Keogh Plans\n\nKeogh plans were established through legislation by Congress in 1962 and were spearheaded by Rep. Eugene Keogh. As with other qualified retirement accounts, funds can be accessed as early as age 59½, and [withdrawals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withdrawal.asp) must begin by age 72, or 70½ if you were 70½ before Jan. 1, 2020.2\n\nKeogh plans have more administrative burdens and higher upkeep costs than [Simplified Employee Pension](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sep.asp) (SEP) or 401(k) plans, but the contribution limits are higher, making Keogh plans a popular option for many high-income business owners.

Whether it's a lemonade stand or a publicly-traded multinational company, the primary goal of any business is to earn money, therefore a business performance is based on profitability, in its various forms.\n\nSome analysts are interested in top-line profitability, whereas others are interested in profitability before taxes and other expenses. Still others are only concerned with profitability after all expenses have been paid.\n\nThe three major types of profit are gross profit, operating profit, and net profit--all of which can be found on the income statement. Each profit type gives analysts more information about a company's performance, especially when it's compared to other competitors and time periods.\n\n### \n\nThe word “profit” comes from the Latin noun *profectus*, meaning “progress,” and the verb *proficere*, meaning “to advance.”\n\n## Gross, Operating, and Net Profit\n\nThe first level of profitability is [gross profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp), which is sales minus the cost of goods sold. Sales are the first line item on the income statement, and the cost of goods sold (COGS) is generally listed just below it:\n\n> *Gross Profit = Revenues - COGS*\n\nFor example, if Company A has $100,000 in sales and a COGS of $60,000, it means the gross profit is $40,000, or $100,000 minus $60,000. Divide gross profit by sales for the [gross profit margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross_profit_margin.asp), which is 40%, or $40,000 divided by $100,000.\n\n[Operating profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_profit.asp) removes operating expenses like overhead and other indirect costs as well as accounting costs like [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) and amortization. It is sometimes referred to as earnings before interest and taxes, or [EBIT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp).\n\n> *Operating Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) - Operating Expenses - Depreciation & Amortization*\n\nNet profit furthermore removes the costs of interest and taxes paid by the business. Because it falls at the bottom of the income statement, it is sometimes referred to as the firm's \"[bottom line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottomline.asp).\"\n\n> *Net Profit = EBIT - Interest Expense - Taxes*\n\nThe bottom line tells a company how profitable it was during a period and how much it has available for dividends and retained earnings. What's retained can be used to pay off debts, fund projects, or reinvest in the company. \n \n\n## Where Does Profit Come From?\n\nIn a capitalist system where firms compete with one another to sell their goods, the question of where profits come from has been one of interest among economists. [Karl Marx](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/karl-marx.asp), for instance, argued that profits arise from [surplus labor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marxian-economics.asp) extracted from workers by business owners. Modern thinkers suggest that profits compensate for the risk that entrepreneurs take on when starting a business. Others argue that profits arise from [inefficient markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inefficientmarket.asp) and [imperfect competition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imperfect_competition.asp).1\n\n## What Is the Corporate Tax Rate on Profits?\n\nIn the U.S., the corporate tax rate on profits is currently 21% (reduced from 35% since the 2017 [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://www.investopedia.com/tax-deductions-that-are-going-away-4582165)).2\n\n## What Does a Company's Bottom Line Tell You?\n\nThe bottom line tells a company how profitable it was during a period and how much it has available for dividends and retained earnings. What's retained can be used to pay off debts, fund projects, or reinvest in the company. An increasing bottom line is a sign that a company is growing, while a shrinking bottom line could be a red flag.", "timestamp": 1655171862, "digest": "di0oK29hV84FSy1bGljtG-vpTxj0vLF-fy0PSQpdQRc", "contributor": "0xc521BB7978d502B0632Dd231B50fCdC1D9995FC1"}
{"id": "CQQqxl1zEuZkmZWwnf2p8jSPZdJVvMJhdVrxXZ45rLk", "title": "Kickback", "body": "## What Is a Kickback?\n\nA kickback is an illegal payment intended as compensation for preferential treatment or any other type of improper services received. The kickback may be money, a gift, credit, or anything of value. Paying or receiving kickbacks is a corrupt practice that interferes with an employee's or a public official’s ability to make unbiased decisions. Kickbacks are often referred to as a type of bribery.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A kickback is an illegal payment intended as compensation for preferential treatment or any other type of improper services received.\n* Kickbacks are often referred to as a type of bribery.\n* While kickbacks can take many different forms, they all feature some sort of collusion between two parties.\n* Paying or receiving kickbacks is a corrupt practice that interferes with an employee's or a public official’s ability to make unbiased decisions.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 25 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:25\n\n#### Click Play to Learn What Kickbacks Are\n\n## How a Kickback Works\n\nWhile kickbacks can take many different forms, they all feature some sort of collusion between two parties. For example, the bookkeeper for a business or government office might approve an invoice for goods, knowing that the bill is inflated. The seller of the goods might then pay the bookkeeper part of the difference (or some other kind of reward). Kickback schemes are among the most difficult [white-collar crimes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/white-collar-crime.asp) to detect and investigate.\n\nKickbacks can also be used to buy a positive recommendation for the kickback provider. For example, a government employee responsible for managing contractors on an infrastructure project–such as the building of a bridge–might receive a kickback for choosing one contractor over another. This may result in a better-qualified contractor not winning the bid.\n\n[Procurement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/procurement.asp) contracts can be fertile ground for kickback schemes. For example, in the granting of a government contract for office equipment, contractors interested in winning the business are typically required to bid against each other. Rather than playing fair, a contractor might reach out to a procurement officer and indicate that, if the contractor were to win, the officer would be rewarded. The reward might be cash, concert tickets, etc.\n\nThese are some common kickback warning signs. They don't necessarily mean that anything nefarious is going on, but the more of them there are, the greater the likelihood of a kickback scheme.\n\n* No competitive bidding process (or lower bids are ignored)\n* Lack of appropriate supervision during the purchasing process\n* Higher-than-average prices for goods or services\n* Recommendation to use a vendor that others shun\n* A vendor with frequent legal or regulatory problems\n* Employees are too friendly with vendors\n* Management pressures staff to use a particular vendor\n* Vendors are in an industry where kickbacks are common\n* Employees continue to use vendors that provide poor products or services\n* Delivery dates are repeatedly missed\n\nKickbacks increase the cost of doing business in countries around the world; they also form the basis for much of the world's government corruption. Companies looking to supply products or services to countries known for corruption may find that they have to pay numerous officials in order to be considered for a contract. The perception that a kickback scheme will go unpunished—or that punishment will be light—is a primary driver for officials willing to take bribes. In some cases, they may be poorly paid and see kickbacks as a way to supplement a meager salary.\n\nEven if it is the local custom, the U.S. [Foreign Corrupt Practices Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.asp) makes bribing foreign officials illegal for all companies listed with the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp), any company organized in the United States, or any citizen or resident.1﻿\n\n## Example of a Kickback\n\nOn Wall Street, brokers sometimes route all orders to a particular exchange (even though they are required by law to execute trades with the one that offers the best terms, or [best-execution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bestexecution.asp), for their clients). Rather than choosing the exchange that offers the most competitive price and has the highest likelihood of completing the trade in a timely manner, the broker may take a kickback in exchange for routing all of their trades to that particular exchange. This can ultimately lead to slower execution and higher transaction costs for clients. The industry refers to the practice as \"rebates.\" While rebates may amount to only a fraction of a cent of each share traded, over time, considerable sums can be accrued.\n\nIn the advertising business, kickbacks can take the form of rebates or fraudulent billing for nonexistent services.

{"id": "h35CDjngz1GyDyywCv_Rgvw0qVplXRVhdjSmWMbVLtk", "title": "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)", "body": "## What Are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?\n\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) refer to a set of quantifiable measurements used to gauge a company’s overall long-term performance.\n\nKPIs specifically help determine a company's strategic, financial, and operational achievements, especially compared to those of other businesses within the same sector.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Key performance indicators (KPIs) measure a company's success versus a set of targets, objectives, or industry peers.\n* KPIs can be financial, including net profit (or the bottom line, gross profit margin), revenues minus certain expenses, or the current ratio (liquidity and cash availability).\n* Customer-focused KPIs generally center on per-customer efficiency, customer satisfaction, and customer retention.\n* Process-focused KPIs aim to measure and monitor operational performance across the organization.\n* Generally speaking, businesses measure and track KPIs through business analytics software and reporting tools.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 40 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:40\n\n#### Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\n## Understanding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nAlso referred to as key success indicators (KSIs), KPIs vary between companies and between industries, depending on performance criteria.\n\nFor example, a software company striving to attain the fastest growth in its industry may consider [year-over-year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/year-over-year.asp) (YOY) revenue growth as its chief performance indicator. Contrarily, a retail chain might place more value on same-store sales, as the best KPI metric in which to gauge its growth.\n\nKey performance indicators (KPI) gauge a company's output against a set of targets, objectives, or industry peers.\n\n## Types of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n### Financial Metrics\n\nKey performance indicators tied to the financials typically focus on revenue and profit margins. Net profit, the most tried and true of profit-based measurements, represents the amount of revenue that remains, as profit for a given period, after accounting for all of the company's expenses, taxes, and interest payments for the same period.\n\nCalculated as a dollar amount, net profit must be converted into a percentage of revenue (known as \"net profit margin\"), to be used in comparative analysis.\n\nFor example, if the standard net profit margin for a given industry is 50%, a new business in that space knows it must work toward meeting or beating that figure if it wishes to remain competitively viable. The gross profit margin, which measures revenues after accounting for expenses directly associated with the production of goods for sale, is another common profit-based KPI.\n\nA financial KPI that's known as the “current ratio” focuses largely on liquidity and can be calculated by dividing a company's current assets by its current debts.\n\nA financially healthy company typically has sufficient cash on hand to meet its financial obligations for the current 12-month period. However, different industries rely on different amounts of debt financing, therefore a company ought to only compare its current ratio to those of other businesses within the same industry, to ascertain how its cash flow stacks up amongst its peers. \n\n### Customer Metrics\n\nCustomer-focused KPIs generally center on per-customer efficiency, customer satisfaction, and customer retention.\n\nCustomer lifetime value (CLV) represents the total amount of money that a customer is expected to spend on your products over the entire business relationship.\n\nCustomer acquisition cost (CAC), by comparison, represents the total sales and marketing cost required to land a new customer. By comparing CAC to CLV, businesses can measure the effectiveness of their customer acquisition efforts.\n\n### Process Performance Metrics\n\nProcess metrics aim to measure and monitor operational performance across the organization.\n\nBy dividing the number of defective products by total products produced, for example, businesses can measure the percentage of defective products. Naturally, the goal would be to get this number down as low as possible.\n\nThroughput time represents the total amount of time it takes to run a particular process. For example, a drive-through restaurant throughput can measure how long it takes to service an average customer; from the time they make their order to the time they drive away with their food.\n\n## Examples of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nLet's take a look at electric vehicle-maker Tesla ([TSLA](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=tsla)) for a few examples of KPIs in real life. These numbers are all from their Q4 2021 earnings release.\n\n### Vehicle Production\n\nDuring the quarter, Tesla produced a record 305,840 vehicles and delivered 308,650 vehicles.1 Production is a big deal for the company because it has consistently been criticized for being bad at ramping up.\n\nIncreased manufacturing scale means more market share and profits for Tesla.\n\n### Automotive Gross Margin\n\nFor the quarter, Tesla's automotive gross margin expanded to 30.6%.2 Gross margin is one of the best measures of profitability for Tesla because it isolates its vehicle production costs.\n\nTesla managed to expand its gross margin in Q4 even as sales of lower-priced models outpaced its higher-margin models.1\n\n### Free Cash Flow\n\nTesla's free cash flow clocked in at $2.8 billion during the quarter. That represents a vast improvement from the $1.9 billion free cash flow in the year-ago period.2\n\nTesla's current level of free cash flow production suggests that the company is reaching a scale of profitability without the help of regulatory credits.3\n\n## Limitations of Using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nSome of the disadvantages to using KPIs include:\n\n* The long time frame required for KPIs to provide meaningful data\n* They require constant monitoring and close follow-up to be useful\n* They open up the possibility for managers to \"game\" KPIs\n* Quality has a tendency to drop when managers are hyperfocused on productivity KPIs\n* Employees can be pushed too hard aiming specifically for KPIs\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nKPIs do not necessarily have to be solely tied to financial data.\n\nWhile profits and debt levels are indeed important [key financial indicators](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061916/what-best-measure-companys-financial-health.asp), a company’s relationships with both its customers and its employees are no less important to establishing its general health.\n\n### Non-Financial KPIs\n\n*Common non-financial KPIs include measures of foot traffic, employee turnover rates, the number of repeat customers versus new customers, and various quality metrics.* \n\n## KPI FAQs\n\n### What Is a KPI Example?\n\nOne of the most basic examples of a KPI is Revenue Per Client (RPC). For example, if you generate $100,000 in revenue annually and you have 100 clients, then your RPC is $1,000.\n\n### What Are the 5 Key Performance Indicators?\n\nKPIs vary from business to business. But in general, five of the most commonly used KPIs include:\n\n1. Revenue growth\n2. Revenue per client\n3. Profit margin\n4. Client retention rate\n5. Customer satisfaction\n\n### How Do You Measure KPIs?\n\nIt depends on the actual KPI being measured. But generally speaking, businesses measure and track KPIs through business analytics software and reporting tools.\n\n### What Is a Good KPI?\n\nA good KPI has the following attributes:\n\n* Provides objective and clear information of progress towards an end goal\n* Tracks and measures factors such as efficiency, quality, timeliness, and performance\n* Provides a way to measure performance over time\n* Helps make more informed decisions\n\n### How Do I Create a KPI Report?\n\nFollow these general steps to create a KPI report:\n\n1. Create an overview or introduction\n2. Clearly define the KPIs\n3. Present your KPIs using appropriate graphs, charts, and tables\n4. Make final edits to the report and distribute\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nKPIs offer an effective way to measure and track a company’s performance on a variety of different metrics. By understanding exactly what KPIs are and how to implement them properly, managers are better able to optimize the business for long-term success.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvDXjK1ylnoKJPoxOD7cDkd3e-ImJGOBsEu44cOHD2x-d9Ls7TsmenPeBYhMAWHRW0tpP4dfNhCFfOnrGumaK6GmoB32xLzTBm1aXUdhYvCLHPn8ZHBG4-_GFJnacgbja610wB597OrJximtonDNiwfa4iNCLcf7Tm5quvs9vC2-am9XKbh_DBryErQ0hwEzkDWTM60bB0NuVWwKrv3P9fHH3eJGvWzh_G257jE2BSExeZmxXeuakimRQSH2YJWB8ZJm2IiU_7Nz8V-5GCC_xONL3lgsv4P8cS7vBaj9q-w0QeRv44cVt7CkY3xjuAO5Y__dDaQEBuC-wb4FsicVc8LY0pbXRlfsFMxTOi0Jp3J37U&sig=Cg0ArKJSzK0AyuQMRlWdEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvDXjK1ylnoKJPoxOD7cDkd3e-ImJGOBsEu44cOHD2x-d9Ls7TsmenPeBYhMAWHRW0tpP4dfNhCFfOnrGumaK6GmoB32xLzTBm1aXUdhYvCLHPn8ZHBG4-_GFJnacgbja610wB597OrJximtonDNiwfa4iNCLcf7Tm5quvs9vC2-am9XKbh_DBryErQ0hwEzkDWTM60bB0NuVWwKrv3P9fHH3eJGvWzh_G257jE2BSExeZmxXeuakimRQSH2YJWB8ZJm2IiU_7Nz8V-5GCC_xONL3lgsv4P8cS7vBaj9q-w0QeRv44cVt7CkY3xjuAO5Y__dDaQEBuC-wb4FsicVc8LY0pbXRlfsFMxTOi0Jp3J37U&sig=Cg0ArKJSzK0AyuQMRlWdEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "LnBeWPnkWteaBMD3Ruv9JFDAb-JQ1tx4qgezQg8gDyc", "title": "Karl Marx", "body": "## Who Was Karl Marx?\n\nKarl Marx (1818-1883) was a philosopher, author, social theorist, and [economist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp). He is famous for his theories about [capitalism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp) and [communism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/communism.asp). Marx, in conjunction with [Friedrich Engels](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/friedrich-engels.asp), published *The Communist Manifesto* in 1848; later in life, he wrote *Das Kapital* (the first volume was published in Berlin in 1867; the second and third volumes were published posthumously in 1885 and 1894, respectively), which discussed the [labor theory of value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-theory-of-value.asp).\n\nInvestopedia / Joshua Seong\n\n## Marx's Inspiration\n\nMarx was inspired by classical political economists such as Adam Smith and [David Ricardo](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/david-ricardo.asp), while his own branch of economics, Marxian economics, is not favored among modern mainstream thought. Nevertheless, Marx's ideas have had a huge impact on societies, most prominently in communist projects such as those in the USSR, China, and Cuba. Among modern thinkers, Marx is still very influential in the fields of sociology, political economy, and strands of [heterodox](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heterodox-economics.asp) economics.\n\n## Marx's Social Economic Systems\n\nWhile many equate Karl Marx with socialism, his work on understanding capitalism as a social and economic system remains a valid critique in the modern era. In *Das Kapital* (*Capital* in English), Marx argues that society is composed of two main classes: Capitalists are the business owners who organize the process of production and who own the means of production such as factories, tools, and raw material, and who are also entitled to any and all profits.\n\nThe other, much larger class is composed of labor (which Marx termed the \"proletariat\"). Laborers do not own or have any claim to the means of production, the finished products they work on, or any of the profits generated from sales of those products. Rather, labor works only in return for a money wage. Marx argued that because of this uneven arrangement, capitalists exploit workers.\n\n## Marx's Historical Materialism\n\nAnother important theory developed by Marx is known as historical materialism. This theory posits that society at any given point in time is ordered by the type of technology used in the process of production. Under industrial capitalism, society is ordered with capitalists organizing labor in factories or offices where they work for wages. Prior to capitalism, Marx suggested that feudalism existed as a specific set of social relations between lord and peasant classes related to the hand-powered or animal-powered means of production prevalent at the time.\n\n## Using Marx as a Foundation\n\nMarx's work laid the foundations for future communist leaders such as [Vladimir Lenin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/working-class.asp) and Josef Stalin. Operating from the premise that capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction, his ideas formed the basis of [Marxism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marxism.asp) and served as a theoretical base for communism. Nearly everything Marx wrote was viewed through the lens of the common laborer. From Marx comes the idea that capitalist profits are possible because the value is \"stolen\" from the workers and transferred to employers. He was, without question, one of the most important and revolutionary thinkers of his time.\n\n## His Early Life\n\nBorn in Trier, Prussia (now Germany), on May 5, 1818, Marx was the son of a successful Jewish lawyer who converted to Lutheranism before Marx’s birth. Marx studied law in Bonn and Berlin, and at Berlin, was introduced to the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel. He became involved in radicalism at a young age through the Young Hegelians, a group of students who criticized the political and religious establishments of the day. Marx received his doctorate from the University of Jena in 1841. His radical beliefs prevented him from securing a teaching position, so instead, he took a job as a journalist and later became the editor of *Rheinische Zeitung*, a liberal newspaper in Cologne.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nAfter living in Prussia, Marx lived in France for some time, and that is where he met his lifelong friend Friedrich Engels. He was expelled from France and then lived for a brief period in Belgium before moving to London where he spent the rest of his life with his wife. Marx died of bronchitis and pleurisy in London on March 14, 1883. He was buried at Highgate Cemetery in London. His original grave was nondescript, but in 1954, the Communist Party of Great Britain unveiled a large tombstone, including a bust of Marx and the inscription \"Workers of all Lands Unite,\" an Anglicized interpretation of the famous phrase in *The Communist Manifesto*: \"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\"\n\n## Famous Works\n\n*The Communist Manifesto* summarizes Marx and Engels's theories about the nature of society and politics and is an attempt to explain the goals of Marxism, and, later, [socialism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialism.asp). When writing *The Communist Manifesto*, Marx and Engels explained how they thought capitalism was unsustainable and how the capitalist society that existed at the time of the writing would eventually be replaced by a socialist one.\n\n*Das Kapital* (full title: *Capital: A Critique of Political Economy*) was a critique of capitalism. By far the more academic work, it lays forth Marx's theories on commodities, labor markets, the division of labor and a basic understanding of the rate of return to owners of capital. The exact origins of the term \"capitalism\" in English are unclear, it appears that Karl Marx was not the first to use the word \"capitalism\" in English, although he certainly contributed to the rise of its use.1\n\nAccording to the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the English word was first used by author William Thackeray in 1854, in his novel *The Newcomes*, who intended it to mean a sense of concern about personal possessions and money in general. While it's unclear whether either Thackeray or Marx was aware of the other's work, both men meant the word to have a pejorative ring.\n\n## Contemporary Influence\n\nMarxist ideas in their pure form have very few direct adherents in contemporary times; indeed, very few Western thinkers embraced Marxism after 1898, when economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk's *Karl Marx and the Close of His System* was first translated into English. In his damning rebuke, Böhm-Bawerk showed that Marx failed to incorporate [capital markets](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/capital-markets/) or subjective values in his analysis, nullifying most of his more pronounced conclusions. Still, there are some lessons that even modern economic thinkers can learn from Marx.\n\nThough he was the capitalist system's harshest critic, Marx understood that it was far more productive than previous or alternative economic systems. In *Das Kapital*, he wrote of \"capitalist production\" that combined \"together of various processes into a social whole,\" which included developing new technologies.2\n\nHe believed all countries should become capitalist and develop that productive capacity, and then workers would naturally revolt into communism. But, like Adam Smith and David Ricardo before him, Marx predicted that because of capitalism's relentless pursuit of profit by way of competition and technological progress to lower the costs of production, that the rate of profit in an economy would always be falling over time.\n\n## The Labor Theory of Value\n\nLike the other [classical economists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/classicaleconomics.asp), Karl Marx believed in the labor theory of value to explain relative differences in market prices. This theory stated that the value of a produced economic good can be measured objectively by the average number of labor hours required to produce it. In other words, if a table takes twice as long to make as a chair, then the table should be considered twice as valuable.\n\nMarx understood the labor theory better than his predecessors (even Adam Smith) and contemporaries, and presented a devastating intellectual challenge to [laissez-faire ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp)economists in *Das Kapital*: If goods and services tend to be sold at their true objective labor values as measured in labor hours, how do any capitalists enjoy profits? It must mean, Marx concluded, that capitalists were underpaying or overworking, and thereby exploiting, laborers to drive down the [cost of production.1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production-cost.asp)\n\nWhile Marx's answer was eventually proved incorrect and later economists adopted the [subjective theory of value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subjective-theory-of-value.asp), his simple assertion was enough to show the weakness of the labor theory's logic and assumptions; Marx unintentionally helped fuel a revolution in economic thinking.\n\n## Economic Change to Social Transformation\n\nDr. James Bradford \"Brad\" DeLong, professor of economics at UC-Berkeley, wrote in 2011 that Marx's \"primary contribution\" to economic science actually came in a 10-paragraph stretch of *The Communist Manifesto*, in which he describes how economic growth causes shifts among social classes, often leading to a struggle for political power.\n\nThis underlies an often unappreciated aspect of economics: the emotions and political activity of the actors involved. A corollary of this argument was later made by French economist Thomas Piketty, who proposed that while nothing was wrong with [income inequality](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110215/brief-history-income-inequality-united-states.asp) in an economic sense, it could create blowback against capitalism among the people. Thus, there is a moral and anthropological consideration of any economic system. The idea that societal structure and transformations from one order to the next can be the result of technological change in how things are produced in an economy is known as historical materialism.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstZ0FLWxCngYVTBI3RNvio9LswacoFqmxtNTfh4Ipa9hNtEGrqNALuhFMVnsKEjx9_zzrIWPa0GfkTCxmtkdRKqQKmjdYiw2e6IAp_CUKUbtz6Xs0sT6WmX5beS0K0Yp6roLbZ0nnhtKRQJEWb9gzd7sWhGdGwRrcizprXoXcfdpwVyttB4mYmeWQiBk5BBsK0nQaMm8frQjVAFXZGRruUG1btM4P6p1i5jCvpVxthwiQDmqorI7SiqjC2WMqq6epecjniHwwwLu5Lop2LTGEVdpFCa9zfeVEcuAvXpBRS5hZ_LcTS0-WjAq6alEr6qs1501ljO25buOHXn&sig=Cg0ArKJSzM-bWd0BLmLFEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstZ0FLWxCngYVTBI3RNvio9LswacoFqmxtNTfh4Ipa9hNtEGrqNALuhFMVnsKEjx9_zzrIWPa0GfkTCxmtkdRKqQKmjdYiw2e6IAp_CUKUbtz6Xs0sT6WmX5beS0K0Yp6roLbZ0nnhtKRQJEWb9gzd7sWhGdGwRrcizprXoXcfdpwVyttB4mYmeWQiBk5BBsK0nQaMm8frQjVAFXZGRruUG1btM4P6p1i5jCvpVxthwiQDmqorI7SiqjC2WMqq6epecjniHwwwLu5Lop2LTGEVdpFCa9zfeVEcuAvXpBRS5hZ_LcTS0-WjAq6alEr6qs1501ljO25buOHXn&sig=Cg0ArKJSzM-bWd0BLmLFEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock's value while also factoring in the company's expected earnings growth, and it is thought to provide a more complete picture than the more standard P/E ratio.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding in expected earnings growth into the calculation.\n* The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator of a stock's true value, and similar to the P/E ratio, a lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued.\n* The PEG for a given company may differ significantly from one reported source to another, depending on which growth estimate is used in the calculation, such as one-year or three-year projected growth.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 37 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:37\n\n#### PEG Ratio\n\n## How to Calculate the PEG Ratio\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{PEG Ratio}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Price/EPS}}{\\\\text{EPS Growth}}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EPS = The earnings per share}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​PEG Ratio=EPS GrowthPrice/EPS​where:EPS = The earnings per share​﻿\n\nTo calculate the [PEG ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/what-considered-good-peg-price-earnings-growth-ratio.asp), an investor or analyst needs to either look up or calculate the P/E ratio of the company in question. The P/E ratio is calculated as the price per share of the company divided by the earnings per share (EPS), or price per share / EPS.\n\nOnce the P/E is calculated, find the expected growth rate for the stock in question, using analyst estimates available on financial websites that follow the stock. Plug the figures into the equation, and solve for the PEG ratio number.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAs with any ratio, the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used. When considering a company's PEG ratio from a published source, it's important to find out which growth rate was used in the calculation. In an article from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, for example, the PEG ratio is calculated using a P/E ratio based on current-year data and a five-year expected growth rate.1\n\nUsing historical growth rates, for example, may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are expected to deviate from a company's historical growth. The ratio can be calculated using one-year, three-year, or five-year expected growth rates, for example.\n\nTo distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical growth, the terms \"forward PEG\" and \"trailing PEG\" are sometimes used.\n\n## What Does the Price/Earnings-to-Growth Ratio Tell You?\n\nWhile a low [P/E ratio may make a stock look like a good buy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/043002.asp), factoring in the company's growth rate to [get the stock's PEG ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/use-pe-ratio-and-peg-to-tell-stocks-future/) may tell a different story. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock may be undervalued given its future earnings expectations. Adding a company's expected growth into the ratio helps to adjust the result for companies that may have a high growth rate and a high P/E ratio.\n\nThe degree to which a PEG ratio result indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type. As a broad rule of thumb, some investors feel that a PEG ratio below one is desirable.\n\nAccording to well-known investor Peter Lynch, a company's P/E and expected growth should be equal, which denotes a fairly valued company and supports a PEG ratio of 1.0. When a company's PEG exceeds 1.0, it's considered overvalued while a stock with a PEG of less than 1.0 is considered undervalued.2\n\n## Example of How to Use the PEG Ratio\n\nThe PEG ratio provides useful information to compare companies and see which stock might be the better choice for an investor's needs, as follows.\n\nAssume the following data for two hypothetical companies, Company A and Company B:\n\n### Company A:\n\n* Price per share = $46\n* EPS this year = $2.09\n* EPS last year = $1.74\n\n### Company B\n\n* Price per share = $80\n* EPS this year = $2.67\n* EPS last year = $1.78\n\nGiven this information, the following data can be calculated for each company.\n\n### Company A\n\n* P/E ratio = $46 / $2.09 = 22\n* Earnings growth rate = ($2.09 / $1.74) - 1 = 20%\n* PEG ratio = 22 / 20 = 1.1\n\n### Company B\n\n* P/E ratio = $80 / $2.67 = 30\n* Earnings growth rate = ($2.67 / $1.78) - 1 = 50%\n* PEG ratio = 30 / 50 = 0.6\n\nMany investors may look at Company A and find it more attractive since it has a lower P/E ratio between the two companies. But compared to Company B, it doesn't have a high enough growth rate to justify its P/E. Company B is trading at a discount to its growth rate and investors purchasing it are paying less per unit of earnings growth.", "timestamp": 1655171665, "digest": "g3JnQNEXTldTgocZ9-Rb4K0epCvG_m-vJVJe1CO93hI", "contributor": "0x7f95Ffaa02F316f32773Cbf97777B8C2eF41E214"}

The details of each preferred stock depend on the issue. \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Preferred stockholders have a higher claim on distributions (e.g. dividends) than common stockholders.\n* Preferred stockholders usually have no or limited, voting rights in corporate governance.1\n* In the event of a liquidation, preferred stockholders' claim on assets is greater than common stockholders but less than bondholders.2\n* Preferred stock has characteristics of both bonds and common stock which enhances its appeal to certain investors.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 17 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:17\n\n#### What Is The Difference Between Preferred Stock And Common Stock?\n\n## Understanding Preferred Stock\n\nPreferred shareholders have priority over common stockholders when it comes to dividends, which generally yield more than common stock and can be paid monthly or quarterly.1﻿ These dividends can be fixed or set in terms of a benchmark interest rate like the [London InterBank Offered Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) (LIBOR)​, and are often quoted as a percentage in the issuing description.\n\nAdjustable-rate shares specify certain factors that influence the dividend yield, and participating shares can pay additional dividends that are reckoned in terms of common stock dividends or the company's profits. The decision to pay the dividend is at the discretion of a company's board of directors.\n\nUnlike common stockholders, preferred stockholders have limited rights which usually does not include voting.1﻿ Preferred stock combines features of debt, in that it pays fixed dividends, and equity, in that it has the potential to appreciate in price. This appeals to investors seeking stability in potential future cash flows.\n\n## Companies in Distress\n\nIf a company is struggling and has to suspend its dividend, preferred shareholders may have the right to receive payment in arrears before the dividend can be resumed for common shareholders.1 Shares that have this arrangement are known as cumulative. If a company has multiple simultaneous issues of preferred stock, these may in turn be ranked in terms of priority. The highest ranking is called prior, followed by first preference, second preference, etc.\n\nPreferred shareholders have a prior claim on a company's assets if it is liquidated, though they remain subordinate to bondholders. Preferred shares are equity, but in many ways, they are hybrid assets that lie between stock and bonds. They offer more predictable income than common stock and are rated by the major credit rating agencies.\n\nUnlike bondholders, failing to pay a dividend to preferred shareholders does not mean a company is in default. Because preferred shareholders do not enjoy the same guarantees as creditors, the ratings on preferred shares are generally lower than the same issuer's bonds, with the yields being accordingly higher.2\n\n## Voting Rights, Calling, and Convertibility\n\nPreferred shares usually do not carry voting rights, although under some agreements these rights may revert to shareholders that have not received their dividend.1 Preferred shares have less potential to appreciate in price than common stock, and they usually trade within a few dollars of their issue price, most commonly $25. Whether they trade at a discount or premium to the issue price depends on the company's creditworthiness and the specifics of the issue: for example, whether the shares are cumulative, their priority relative to other issues, and whether they are callable.2\n\nIf shares are callable, the issuer can purchase them back at par value after a set date. If interest rates fall, for example, and the dividend yield does not have to be as high to be attractive, the company may call its shares and issue another series with a lower yield. Shares can continue to trade past their call date if the company does not exercise this option.2\n\nSome preferred stock is convertible, meaning it can be exchanged for a given number of common shares under certain circumstances.2 The board of directors might vote to convert the stock, the investor might have the option to convert, or the stock might have a specified date at which it automatically converts. Whether this is advantageous to the investor depends on the market price of the common stock.\n\n## Typical Buyers of Preferred Stock\n\nPreferred stock comes in a wide variety of forms and is generally purchased through [online stockbrokers](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-brokers-4587872) by individual investors. The features described above are only the more common examples, and these are frequently combined in a number of ways. A company can issue preferred shares under almost any set of terms, assuming they don't fall foul of laws or regulations. Most preferred issues have no maturity dates or very distant ones.2\n\nInstitutions are usually the most common purchasers of preferred stock. This is due to certain tax advantages that are available to them, but which are not available to individual investors.3 Because these institutions buy in bulk, preferred issues are a relatively simple way to raise large amounts of capital. Private or pre-public companies issue preferred stock for this reason.\n\nPreferred stock issuers tend to group near the upper and lower limits of the credit-worthiness spectrum. Some issue preferred shares because regulations prohibit them from taking on any more debt, or because they risk being downgraded. While preferred stock is technically equity, it is similar in many ways to a bond issue; One type, known as trust preferred stock, can act as debt from a tax perspective and common stock on the balance sheet.4 On the other hand, several established names like General Electric, Bank of America, and Georgia Power issue preferred stock to finance projects.567\n\n## What Are the Advantages of a Preferred Stock?\n\nA preferred stock is a class of stock that is granted certain rights that differ from common stock. Namely, preferred stock often possesses higher dividend payments, and a higher claim to assets in the event of liquidation. In addition, preferred stock can have a callable feature, which means that the issuer has the right to redeem the shares at a predetermined price and date as indicated in the prospectus. In many ways, preferred stock shares similar characteristics to bonds, and because of this are sometimes referred to as hybrid securities. \n\n## What Is the Difference Between a Preferred Stock and a Common Stock?\n\nWhile preferred stock and common stock are both equity instruments, they share important distinctions. First, preferreds receive a fixed dividend as dividend obligations to preferred shareholders must be satisfied first. Common stockholders, on the other hand, may not always receive a dividend. Secondly, preferreds typically do not share in the price appreciation (or depreciation) to the same degree as common stock. Lastly, preferred typically have no voting rights, whereas common stockholders do.\n\n## What Is an Example of a Preferred Stock?\n\nConsider a company is issuing a 7% preferred stock at a $1,000 par value. In turn, the investor would receive a $70 annual dividend, or $17.50 quarterly. Typically, this preferred stock will trade around its par value, behaving more similarly to a bond. Investors who are looking to generate income may choose to invest in this security. The most common sector that issues preferred stock is the financial sector, where preferred stock may be issued as a means to raise capital.", "timestamp": 1655171526, "digest": "BqtDHMtQehW8JSAnD-q9Qj8-_KCIpwL4ZX05c1dWUAg", "contributor": "0x24C4aB0600E18a789a077Efc1AF354766f437e15"}

Conversely, the [consumer price index (CPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp) measures price changes encountered by the consumer.1\n\nThe price trends for producers and consumers are unlikely to diverge for long, since producer prices heavily influence those charged consumers, and vice versa. In the short term, inflation at the wholesale and retail levels may differ as a result of distribution costs, as well as government taxes and subsidies.1\n\nThe U.S. [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp) releases the PPI along with its constituent industry and product indexes during the second week of the month following the reference date of the survey.2\n\n### 11%\n\n*The PPI reading for the 12-month period ending April 2022. Wholesale inflation was down slightly from the 11.5% reading in March.*\n\nThe PPI is based on approximately 100,000 monthly price quotes reported voluntarily online by more than 25,000 systematically sampled producer establishments. The survey covers the entirety of the U.S. output of goods and about 71% by value of services. The PPI's component product and services indexes are weighted based on the value of the category's output to calculate the overall change in producer prices.13\n\nThe PPI is used to forecast inflation and to calculate [escalator clauses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escalatorclause.asp) in private contracts based on the prices of key inputs. It is also vital for tracking price changes by industry and comparing wholesale and retail price trends.1\n\nUntil 1978, the PPI was known as the wholesale price index (WPI). In 1982, the BLS reset all producer price index bases to 100.45\n\n## Why PPI and CPI Diverge\n\nThe PPI often measures prices based on the first commercial transaction for a product or service, in contrast with the CPI's focus on the final sale. But the two don't just differ based on the type of prices measured. There are also important compositional differences between the PPI and the CPI based on what's included and left out.\n\nFor example, the PPI does not measure price change for aggregate housing costs, while the CPI's shelter category including the imputed owners' equivalent of rents accounts for one-third of the overall index. Meanwhile, the PPI incorporates a weighting of nearly 18% for health care products and services not far off the sector's weight of nearly 20% in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In contrast, because the CPI does not measure third-party health care reimbursements, its weighting for medical care is below 9%.678\n\nAnother key distinction is that the PPI does not include the price of imported goods, unlike the CPI. Conversely, the PPI includes export prices while the CPI does not, by definition.6\n\n## How PPI Numbers Are Presented\n\nThe BLS produces more than 10,000 product and industry price indexes each month it then uses to calculate the PPI. They're published with and without seasonal adjustments, and are divided into three categories.9\n\n### Industry Level Classification\n\nThe PPI includes indexes for producer prices received in each of more than 500 industry categories based on output sold outside the industry. The categories are compatible with those used in other releases to report industry-level data on production, employment, earnings, and productivity.\n\n### Commodity Classification\n\nCommodity classification disregards the producer's industry to group output based on the nature of product or service. The PPI report publishes more than 3,800 commodity price indexes for goods and some 900 for services.\n\n### Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID)\n\nThe FD-ID indexes use the commodity indexes organized by product to measure producer prices based on the economic identity of the buyers and whether the goods sold require further processing. The PPI report publishes more than 600 FD-ID indexes. The final demand indexes, as distinct from the intermediate demand ones, are then used to arrive at the headline PPI number, which reflects the Producer Price Index for final demand.", "timestamp": 1655171793, "digest": "NeJBTbSJcJqsh6fHUBV8uWYXH5OW7hTOjI6zRtc5n84", "contributor": "0x2D4698A9e01294073FD2F6226aBD610654Efdaf1"}
{"id": "UwUa2K1M1XmUeDTeyJrEYbDVJDqbjmIEqIXV9uaVfA8", "title": "Key Person Insurance", "body": "## What Is Key Person Insurance?\n\nKey person insurance is a [life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp) policy that a company purchases on the life of an owner, a top executive, or another individual considered critical to the business. The company is the [beneficiary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp) of the policy and pays the [premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp). This type of life insurance is also known as \"key man (or \"keyman\") insurance,\" \"key woman insurance,\" and \"business life insurance.\"\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Key person insurance is a life insurance policy a company buys on the life of a top executive or another critical individual. \n* Such insurance is needed if that person's death would be devastating to the future of the company.\n* For small businesses, the key person might be the owner or founder.\n* The company pays the insurance premiums and is the policy's beneficiary, should the person die.\n\n## Understanding Key Person Insurance\n\nKey person insurance offers a [financial cushion](https://www.investopedia.com/best-key-person-insurance-5116620) if the sudden loss of a certain individual would profoundly negatively affect the company's operations. The [death benefit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathbenefit.asp) essentially buys the company time to find a new person or to implement other strategies to save (or shut down) the business.\n\nIn a small business, the key person is usually the owner, the founders, or perhaps a key employee or two. The main qualifying point is whether the person's absence would cause major financial harm to the company. If this is the case, key person insurance is definitely worth considering.\n\nIn addition to life insurance, key person insurance is also available as disability coverage in case the individual is incapacitated and no longer able to work.\n\n## The Process of Key Person Insurance\n\nFor key person insurance, a company purchases a life insurance policy on certain employee(s), pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of the policy. In the event of the person's death, the company receives the policy's death benefit.\n\nThat money can be used to cover the costs of recruiting, hiring, and training a replacement for the deceased person. If the company doesn't believe it can continue operations, it can use the money to pay off debts, distribute money to investors, provide severance benefits to employees, and close the business down in an orderly manner. Key person insurance gives the company some options other than immediate [bankruptcy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp).\n\nTo determine whether a business needs this kind of coverage, company leaders must consider who is irreplaceable in the short term. In many small businesses, it's the owner who does most things, such as keeping the books, managing employees, handling key customers, etc. Without this person, the business can come to a stop.\n\n## Categories of Loss Covered by Key Person Insurance\n\nKey person insurance can cover a company against a range of risks. For example, it may provide:\n\n1. Insurance to protect profits—for example, offsetting lost income from lost sales or losses resulting from the delay or cancellation of any business project involving a key person.\n2. Insurance designed to protect shareholders or partnership interests. Typically, this enables the surviving shareholders or partners to purchase the financial interests of the deceased person.\n3. Insurance for anyone involved in guaranteeing business loans or banking facilities. The value of insurance coverage is arranged to equal the value of the guarantee.\n\n## Cost of Key Person Insurance\n\nHow much insurance a company needs will depend on the size and nature of the business and the key person's role. It's worth asking for quotes on $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, $750,000, and $1 million policies and comparing the costs of each.\n\nThe cost will also depend on whether the company buys a [term life policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) or a [permanent life policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanentlife.asp). Term life is almost always significantly cheaper.\n\nIn addition, the cost of the coverage will vary according to the insured person's age and overall health, just like most other types of life insurance.\n\nOne major insurer, for example, would currently charge $107 a month for a $500,000, 20-year term policy on a healthy 50-year-old male. Raising the coverage to $1 million would bring the monthly cost to $190.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvQ4NHzRSFNpLWzj_zVgW6ggFmPrvN9l22VmTDBzXqnlv1woeDQhHvyL8F8WwZ8eZPsYafmH1G8zP6am26PnwvCG-qsVTtHLg7Pg_MmbsaVMcvmRkB-twlSW3bFCCretSfoDchhrvuOaGY4m8vmfLVn9lEOz5vazc9qF0dLC_K5eGuSjC_DqxbTefARJit9jVEMKFI4MTJDyyHMx0fOBitD-VQCe47tCw2uR6KomeXIy9gAHk8pfE4E85kwRRKwTexL33WHO287_9hSNyhNYYNS--iDpscOUiEz-NpmZbFF_BtnRpuSJSD3cXUW0_mim1U7DEwSYW8jUh13l_wpwwE&sig=Cg0ArKJSzLKBBvgxRSlFEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

The price may also oscillate between the upper and lower Keltner Channel bands, which can be interpreted as resistance and support levels.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2021\n\n## Understanding the Keltner Channel\n\nThe Keltner Channel was first introduced by Chester Keltner in the 1960s. The original formula used [simple moving averages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp) (SMA) and the high-low price range to calculate the bands. In the 1980s, a new formula was introduced that used [average true range](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp) (ATR). The ATR method is commonly used today.1\n\nThe Keltner Channel is a volatility-based [technical indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp) composed of three separate lines. The middle line is an [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (EMA) of the price. Additional lines are placed above and below the EMA. The upper band is typically set two times the ATR above the EMA, and the lower band is typically set two times the ATR below the EMA. The bands expand and contract as volatility (measured by ATR) expands and contracts.\n\nSince most price action will be encompassed within the upper and lower bands (the channel), moves outside the channel can signal [trend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp) changes or an acceleration of the trend. The direction of the channel, such as up, down, or sideways, can also aid in identifying the trend direction of the [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp).\n\n## Keltner Channel Methods\n\nKeltner Channels have multiple uses and how they are used will largely depend on the settings a trader uses. A longer EMA will mean more [lag](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laggingindicator.asp) in the indicator, so the channels won't respond as quickly to price changes. A shorter EMA will mean the bands react quickly to price changes but will make it harder to identify the true trend direction.\n\nA bigger multiplier of the ATR to create the bands will mean a larger channel. The price will hit the bands less often. A smaller multiplier means the bands will be closer together and the price will reach or exceed the bands more often.\n\nTraders can set up their Keltner Channels any way they like, with the following potential uses in mind:\n\n* The angle of the channel helps to identify trend direction. A rising channel means the price has been rising, while a falling or sideways channel indicates the price has been falling or moving sideways, respectively.\n* A price move above the upper band shows price strength. This is another indication that an [uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp) is in play, especially if the channel is angled upwards.\n* A drop below the lower band shows price weakness. This is evidence of a [downtrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp), especially if the channel is angled downward.\n* If the price is continually hitting the upper band, but not the lower, when the price does finally reach the lower band it could be a sign that the uptrend is losing momentum.\n* If the price is constantly hitting the lower band, but not the upper, when the price does finally reach the upper band it could be a signal that the downtrend is near an end.\n* The price may also oscillate between the upper and lower bands. In cases like these, traders may use the bands as [support and resistance](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/). They may look to buy when the price reaches the lower band and then starts to move higher again and may look to sell or [short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) after the price starts to fall again after reaching the upper band.\n* After a sideways period, if the price breaks above or below the channel and the channel starts to angle the same way, that may signal that a new trend is underway in that [breakout](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp) direction.\n\n## Keltner Channel Calculation\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Keltner Channel Middle Line} = EMA\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Keltner Channel Upper Band} = EMA + 2\\*ATR\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Keltner Channel Lower Band} = EMA - 2\\*ATR\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &EMA = \\\\text{Exponential moving average (typically over 20 periods)}\\\\\\\\ &ATR = \\\\text{Average True Range (typically over 10 or 20 periods)} \\\\end{aligned}​Keltner Channel Middle Line=*EMA*Keltner Channel Upper Band=*EMA*+2∗*ATR*Keltner Channel Lower Band=*EMA*−2∗*ATR*where:*EMA*=Exponential moving average (typically over 20 periods)*ATR*=Average True Range (typically over 10 or 20 periods)​\n\n1. [Calculate the EMA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122314/what-exponential-moving-average-ema-formula-and-how-ema-calculated.asp) for the asset, based on the last 20 periods or the number of periods desired.\n2. [Calculate the ATR](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/average-true-range.asp) of the asset, based on the last 20 periods or the number of periods desired.\n3. Multiply the ATR by two (or the multiplier desired) and then add that number to the EMA value to get the upper band value.\n4. Multiply the ATR by two (or desired multiplier) and then subtract that number from the EMA to get the lower band value.\n5. Repeat all steps after each period ends.\n\n## Keltner Channels vs. Bollinger Bands\n\nThese two indicators are quite similar. Keltner Channels use ATR to calculate the upper and lower bands while [Bollinger Bands](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp) use [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) instead.\n\nThe interpretation of the indicators is similar, although since the calculations are different the two indicators may provide slightly different information or trade signals.\n\nThis indicator is most useful in strongly [trending markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trending-market.asp) when the price is making higher highs and higher lows for an [uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp), or lower highs and lower lows for a [downtrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp).\n\n## Keltner Channel Limitations\n\nThe usefulness of the Keltner Channels largely depends on the settings used. Traders first need to decide how they want to use the indicator and then set it up to help accomplish that purpose. Some of the uses of Keltner Channels, addressed above, won't work if the bands are too narrow or too far apart.\n\nWhile Keltner Channels can help identify trend direction, and even provide some trade signals, they are best used in conjunction with [price action](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp) analysis, [fundamentals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp) if trading for the long term, and other technical indicators.\n\nThe bands may also not act as support or resistance and they may seem to have little forecasting ability at all. This could be due to the settings chosen, but there is also no evidence that the price moving two ATRs or hitting one of the bands will result in a trading opportunity or something significant happening.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What is the Keltner Channel used for?\n\nThe Keltner Channel is used to identify trade opportunities in swing action as prices move within an upper and lower band.\n\n### Who was Chester Keltner?\n\nThe Keltner Channels were originally developed by market technician Chester Keltner in his 1960 book *How to Make Money in Commodities.* Keltner dies in 1998 at the age of 89.2\n\n### What is the difference between the Keltner Channel and Bollinger bands?\n\nBoth technical indicators are similar; however, the Keltner channel utilizes average true range (ATR) while Bollinger bands use standard deviation.\n\n### Are Keltner Channels or Bollinger bands a better metric?\n\nBoth metrics are useful, but for producing different signals. Like Bollinger Bands®, Keltner Channel signals are produced when the price action breaks above or below the channel bands.

{"id": "V1vnYmrriFQ5y-Dt5bKA1rjTLQJ6WQ5vn5XxBDGIEa0", "title": "Present Value (PV)", "body": "## What Is Present Value (PV)?\n\nPresent value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of [cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) given a specified [rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp). Future cash flows are discounted at the discount rate, and the higher the [discount rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp), the lower the present value of the future cash flows. Determining the appropriate discount rate is the key to properly valuing future cash flows, whether they be [earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) or debt obligations.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Present value states that an amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.\n* In other words, present value shows that money received in the future is not worth as much as an equal amount received today.\n* Unspent money today could lose value in the future by an implied annual rate due to inflation or the rate of return if the money was invested.\n* Calculating present value involves assuming that a rate of return could be earned on the funds over the period.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 39 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:39\n\n#### Present Value\n\n## Understanding Present Value (PV)\n\nPresent value is the concept that states an amount of money today is worth more than that same amount in the future. In other words, money received in the future is not worth as much as an equal amount received today.\n\nReceiving $1,000 today is worth more than $1,000 five years from now. Why? An investor can invest the $1,000 today and presumably earn a rate of return over the next five years. Present value takes into account any interest rate an investment might earn.\n\nFor example, if an investor receives $1,000 today and can earn a rate of return of 5% per year, the $1,000 today is certainly worth more than receiving $1,000 five years from now. If an investor waited five years for $1,000, there would be an opportunity cost or the investor would lose out on the rate of return for the five years.\n\n## Inflation and Purchasing Power\n\n[Inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) is the process in which prices of goods and services rise over time. If you receive money today, you can buy goods at today's prices. Presumably, inflation will cause the price of goods to rise in the future, which would lower the purchasing power of your money.\n\nMoney not spent today could be expected to lose value in the future by some implied annual rate, which could be inflation or the rate of return if the money was invested. The present value formula discounts the future value to today's dollars by factoring in the implied annual rate from either inflation or the rate of return that could be achieved if a sum was invested.\n\n## Discount Rate for Finding Present Value\n\nThe discount rate is the investment rate of return that is applied to the present value calculation. In other words, the discount rate would be the forgone rate of return if an investor chose to accept an amount in the future versus the same amount today. The discount rate that is chosen for the present value calculation is highly subjective because it's the expected rate of return you'd receive if you had invested today's dollars for a period of time.\n\nIn many cases, a [risk-free rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp) is determined and used as the discount rate, which is often called the [hurdle rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hurdlerate.asp). The rate represents the rate of return that the investment or project would need to earn in order to be worth pursuing. A [U.S. Treasury](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/what-are-differences-between-treasury-bond-and-treasury-note-and-treasury-bill-tbill.asp) bond rate is often used as the risk-free rate because Treasuries are backed by the U.S. government.1 So, for example, if a two-year Treasury paid 2% interest or [yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp), the investment would need to at least earn more than 2% to justify the risk.\n\nThe discount rate is the sum of the time value and a relevant interest rate that mathematically increases future value in nominal or absolute terms. Conversely, the discount rate is used to work out future value in terms of present value, allowing a lender to settle on the fair amount of any future earnings or obligations in relation to the present value of the capital. The word \"discount\" refers to future value being discounted to present value.\n\nThe calculation of discounted or present value is extremely important in many financial calculations. For example, [net present value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp), bond yields, and pension obligations all rely on discounted or present value. Learning how to use a financial calculator to make present value calculations can help you decide whether you should accept such offers as a cash rebate, 0% financing on the purchase of a car, or pay [points on a mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/points/).\n\n## PV Formula and Calculation\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Present Value} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{FV}}{(1+r)^n}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{FV} = \\\\text{Future Value}\\\\\\\\ &r = \\\\text{Rate of return}\\\\\\\\ &n = \\\\text{Number of periods}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Present Value=(1+*r*)*n*FV​where:FV=Future Value*r*=Rate of return*n*=Number of periods​﻿﻿\n\n1. Input the future amount that you expect to receive in the numerator of the formula.\n2. Determine the interest rate that you expect to receive between now and the future and plug the rate as a decimal in place of \"r\" in the denominator.\n3. Input the time period as the exponent \"n\" in the denominator. So, if you want to calculate the present value of an amount you expect to receive in three years, you would plug the number three in for \"n\" in the denominator.\n4. There are a number of online calculators, including this [present value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/present-value-calculator.html).\n\n## Future Value vs. Present Value\n\nA comparison of present value with [future value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurevalue.asp) (FV) best illustrates the principle of the time value of money and the need for charging or paying additional risk-based interest rates. Simply put, the money today is worth more than the same money tomorrow because of the passage of time. Future value can relate to the future cash inflows from investing today's money, or the future payment required to repay money borrowed today.\n\nFuture value (FV) is the value of a current [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) at a specified date in the future based on an assumed rate of growth. The FV equation assumes a constant rate of growth and a single upfront payment left untouched for the duration of the investment. The FV calculation allows investors to predict, with varying degrees of accuracy, the amount of profit that can be generated by different investments.\n\nPresent value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return. Present value takes the future value and applies a discount rate or the interest rate that could be earned if invested. Future value tells you what an investment is worth in the future while the present value tells you how much you'd need in today's dollars to earn a specific amount in the future.\n\n## Criticism of Present Value\n\nAs stated earlier, calculating present value involves making an assumption that a rate of return could be earned on the funds over the time period. In the discussion above, we looked at one investment over the course of one year. However, if a company is deciding to go ahead with a series of projects that has a different rate of return for each year and each project, the present value becomes less certain if those expected rates of return are not realistic. It's important to consider that in any investment decision, no interest rate is guaranteed, and inflation can erode the rate of return on an investment.\n\n## Example of Present Value\n\nLet's say you have the choice of being paid $2,000 today earning 3% annually or $2,200 one year from now. Which is the best option?\n\n* Using the present value formula, the calculation is $2,200 / (1 +. 03)1 = $2135.92\n* PV = $2,135.92, or the minimum amount that you would need to be paid today to have $2,200 one year from now. In other words, if you were paid $2,000 today and based on a 3% interest rate, the amount would not be enough to give you $2,200 one year from now.\n* Alternatively, you could calculate the future value of the $2,000 today in a year's time: 2,000 x 1.03 = $2,060.\n\nPresent value provides a basis for assessing the fairness of any future financial benefits or liabilities. For example, a future cash rebate discounted to present value may or may not be worth having a potentially higher purchase price. The same financial calculation applies to 0% financing when buying a car.\n\nPaying some interest on a lower sticker price may work out better for the buyer than paying zero interest on a higher sticker price. Paying mortgage points now in exchange for lower mortgage payments later makes sense only if the present value of the future mortgage savings is greater than the mortgage points paid today.\n\n## How Do You Calculate Present Value?\n\nPresent value is calculated by taking the future cashflows expected from an investment and discounting them back to the present day. To do so, the investor needs three key data points: the expected cashflows, the number of years in which the cashflows will be paid, and their discount rate. The discount rate is a very important factor in influencing the present value, with higher discount rates leading to a lower present value, and vice-versa. Using these variables, investors can calculate present value using the formula:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Present Value} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{FV}}{(1+r)^n}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{FV} = \\\\text{Future Value}\\\\\\\\ &r = \\\\text{Rate of return}\\\\\\\\ &n = \\\\text{Number of periods}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Present Value=(1+*r*)*n*FV​where:FV=Future Value*r*=Rate of return*n*=Number of periods​\n\n## What Are Some Examples of Present Value?\n\nTo illustrate, consider a scenario where you expect to earn a $5,000 lump sum payment in five years' time. If the discount rate is 8.25%, you want to know what that payment will be worth today so you calculate the PV = $5000/(1.0825)5 = 3,363.80.\n\n## Why Is Present Value Important?\n\nPresent value is important because it allows investors to judge whether or not the price they pay for an investment is appropriate. For example, in our previous example, having a 12% discount rate would reduce the present value of the investment to only $1,802.39. In that scenario, we would be very reluctant to pay more than that amount for the investment, since our present value calculation indicates that we could find better opportunities elsewhere. Present value calculations like this play a critical role in areas such as investment analysis, risk management, and financial planning.", "timestamp": 1655171600, "digest": "A5xEUkVVB-GnugTlK-JwBwI20sYEeEgGZIUMkLxYodY", "contributor": "0xf6E293648Bd38C3eee4B568656892efa475467cB"}
{"id": "vzi6Ngo6VQStWkqoREe0XggbiddCucdSuZaI7EU0gGo", "title": "Preference Shares", "body": "## What Are Preference Shares?\n\nPreference shares, more commonly referred to as [preferred stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp), are shares of a company’s stock with dividends that are paid out to shareholders before common stock dividends are issued. If the company enters bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are entitled to be paid from company assets before common stockholders.\n\nMost preference shares have a fixed dividend, while common stocks generally do not. Preferred stock shareholders also typically do not hold any voting rights, but common shareholders usually do.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Preference shares (preferred stock) are company stock with dividends that are paid to shareholders before common stock dividends are paid out.\n* There are four types of preferred stock - cumulative (guaranteed), non-cumulative, participating and convertible.\n* Preference shares are ideal for risk-averse investors and they are callable (the issuer can redeem them at any time).\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 43 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:43\n\n#### Preference Shares\n\n## Understanding Preference Shares\n\nPreference shares fall under four categories: cumulative preferred stock, non-cumulative preferred stock, participating preferred stock and convertible preferred stock.1\n\n[Cumulative preferred stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cumulative_preferred_stock.asp) includes a provision that requires the company to pay shareholders all dividends, including those that were omitted in the past, before the common shareholders are able to receive their dividend payments. These dividend payments are guaranteed but not always paid out when they are due. Unpaid dividends are assigned the moniker \"dividends in arrears\" and must legally go to the current owner of the stock at the time of payment. At times additional compensation (interest) is awarded to the holder of this type of preferred stock.\n\n> *Quarterly Dividend = \\[(Dividend Rate) x (Par Value)\\] ÷ 4*\n\n> *Cumulative Dividends per share = Quarterly Dividend x Number of Missed Payments*\n\nNon-cumulative preferred stock does not issue any omitted or unpaid dividends. If the company chooses not to pay dividends in any given year, the shareholders of the non-cumulative preferred stock have no right or power to claim such forgone dividends at any time in the future.\n\n[Participating preferred stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/participatingpreferredstock.asp) provides its shareholders with the right to be paid dividends in an amount equal to the generally specified rate of preferred dividends, plus an additional dividend based on a predetermined condition. This additional dividend is typically designed to be paid out only if the amount of dividends received by common shareholders is greater than a predetermined per-share amount. If the company is liquidated, participating preferred shareholders may also have the right to be paid back the purchasing price of the stock as well as a pro-rata share of remaining proceeds received by common shareholders.\n\nConvertible preferred stock includes an option that allows shareholders to convert their preferred shares into a set number of common shares, generally any time after a pre-established date. Under normal circumstances, convertible preferred shares are exchanged in this way at the shareholder's request. However, a company may have a provision on such shares that allows the shareholders or the issuer to force the issue. How valuable convertible common stocks are is based, ultimately, on how well the [common stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) performs.\n\n## What are preference shares?\n\nPreference shares, also known as preferred shares, are a type of security that offers characteristics similar to both [common shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) and a [fixed-income security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp). The holders of preference shares are typically given priority when it comes to any dividends that the company pays. In exchange, preference shares often do not enjoy the same level of voting rights or upside participation as common shares.\n\n## What are the main types of preference shares?\n\nThere are four main types of preference shares: cumulative preferred, non-cumulative preferred, participating preferred, and convertible. Holders of cumulative preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends retroactively for any dividends that were not paid in prior periods, whereas non-cumulative preferred shares do not carry this provision. For this reason, cumulative preferred shares will generally be more expensive than non-cumulative preferreds. Similarly, participating preferred shares offer the benefit of additional dividends if certain performance targets are reached, such as company profits exceeding a specified level. Convertible preferreds, like [convertible bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblebond.asp), allow the holder to convert their preference shares into common shares at a specified [exercise price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp).\n\n## What happens if you own preference shares in a company that goes bankrupt?\n\nIf a company goes bankrupt, then the different securityholders in that company will have claim to the company’s assets.

{"id": "y9u6hfsxvY1YXCe-dY289PcO-N-rYMrFkpVgXgy2mh8", "title": "Key Rate Duration Definition", "body": "## What Is Key Rate Duration?\n\nKey rate duration measures how the value of a debt security or a debt instrument portfolio, generally bonds, changes at a specific maturity point along the entirety of the yield curve. When keeping other maturities constant, the key rate duration is used to measure the sensitivity in a debt security's price to a 1% change in yield for a specific maturity.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The key rate duration calculates the change in a bond's price in relation to a 100-basis-point (1%) change in the yield for a given maturity.\n* When a yield curve has a parallel shift, you can use effective duration, but key rate duration must be used when the yield curve moves in a non-parallel manner, to estimate portfolio value changes.\n* Duration measures tell you the price risk involved in holding fixed income securities given a change in interest rates.\n\n## The Formula for Key Rate Duration\n\nKey Rate Duration formula.\n\nInvestopedia \n\nWhere:\n\n* P- = a security's price after a 1% *decrease* in its yield\n* P+ = a security's price after a 1% *increase* in its yield\n* P0 = the security's original price\n\n## Calculating Key Rate Duration\n\nAs an example, assume that a [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) is originally priced at $1,000, and with a 1% increase in yield would be priced at $970, and with a 1% decrease in yield would be priced at $1,040. based on the formula above, the key rate duration for this bond would be:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{KRD}=\\\\left(\\\\$1,040 - \\\\$970\\\\right)/\\\\left(2\\\\times1\\\\%\\\\times\\\\$1,000\\\\right)=\\\\$70/\\\\$20=3.5\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{KRD = Key rate duration}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​KRD=($1,040−$970)/(2×1%×$1,000)=$70/$20=3.5where:KRD = Key rate duration​﻿\n\n## What Does Key Rate Duration Tell You?\n\nKey rate duration is an important concept in estimating the expected changes in value for a bond or portfolio of bonds because it does so when the [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp) shifts in a manner that is not perfectly parallel, which occurs often.\n\nEffective duration—another important bond metric—is an insightful duration measure that also calculates expected changes in price for a bond or portfolio of bonds given a 1% change in yield, but it is only valid for parallel shifts in the yield curve. This is why the key rate duration is such a valuable metric.\n\nKey rate duration and effective duration are related. There are 11 maturities along the Treasury [spot rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spot_rate.asp) curve, and a key rate duration may be calculated for each. The sum of all the 11 key rate durations along the portfolio's yield curve equal the [effective duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectiveduration.asp) of the portfolio.\n\n## Example of How to Use the Key Rate Duration\n\nIt can be difficult to interpret an individual key rate duration because it is very unlikely that a single point on the [treasury](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/introduction-treasury-securities.asp) yield curve will have an upwards or downwards shift at a single point while all others remain constant. It's useful for looking at key rate durations across the curve and looking at the relative values of key rate durations between two securities.\n\nFor example, assume bond X has a one-year key rate duration of 0.5 and a five-year key rate duration of 0.9. Bond Y has a key rate durations of 1.2 and 0.3 for these maturity points, respectively. It could be said that bond X is half as sensitive as bond Y on the short-term end of the curve, while bond Y is one-third as sensitive to interest rate changes on the intermediate part of the curve.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstWPBUfAEiSstLvJR7JcAqgcKzqkYtMbXt0RKizetrZPHbLgMOvKw27jMzjkLuD8sMUcQ3E70nFsHRrHJqCMRz3BM0vgx3-HkdeRdk9GvtyWA9I1afznLTOGcZ9oidUsYDKm2dAr8pYg5C1UG_huZDKnDpzhSbgzJ7KPZXC3IfT_Iunt7ZhH8_aQjvkuiF01saU_31cUuDpPnFGDxvcNS2_laY20aw78LrwwUEwXw6fc6Nmh2Me4EJfOQEa0M-EguScUGVJzzdFkHByqmf_d8iOmnx_YK-Cva-UxxkydB6dSNHoi-1WfR9lFZF-tXquQbhNPIr-WpIkNffNHSmHnRzzPtsfp6E63_ITCGpoB145bz4&sig=Cg0ArKJSzLD1cPlRGd5tEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstWPBUfAEiSstLvJR7JcAqgcKzqkYtMbXt0RKizetrZPHbLgMOvKw27jMzjkLuD8sMUcQ3E70nFsHRrHJqCMRz3BM0vgx3-HkdeRdk9GvtyWA9I1afznLTOGcZ9oidUsYDKm2dAr8pYg5C1UG_huZDKnDpzhSbgzJ7KPZXC3IfT_Iunt7ZhH8_aQjvkuiF01saU_31cUuDpPnFGDxvcNS2_laY20aw78LrwwUEwXw6fc6Nmh2Me4EJfOQEa0M-EguScUGVJzzdFkHByqmf_d8iOmnx_YK-Cva-UxxkydB6dSNHoi-1WfR9lFZF-tXquQbhNPIr-WpIkNffNHSmHnRzzPtsfp6E63_ITCGpoB145bz4&sig=Cg0ArKJSzLD1cPlRGd5tEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "YS9TZ3OpvRd6B1zy-q4-vn1HkYemkWv2gZJD818FfPw", "title": "Pro Rata", "body": "## What Is Pro Rata?\n\nPro rata is a Latin term used to describe a proportionate allocation. It essentially translates to \"in proportion,\" which means a process where whatever is being allocated will be distributed in equal portions.\n\nIf something is given out to people on a pro rata basis, it means assigning an amount to one person according to their share of the whole. While a pro rata calculation can be used to determine the appropriate portions of any given whole, it is often used in business finance.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* If something is given out pro rata, it typically means everyone gets their fair share.\n* Pro rata means proportionally, such as fees that rise pro rata with employee salaries.\n* The practice of prorating can apply in many areas, from billing for services to paying out dividends or allocating business partnership income.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 48 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:48\n\n#### Pro-Rata\n\n## Understanding Pro Rata\n\nPro rata typically means that each party or person receives their fair share in proportion to the whole. Pro rata calculations can be used in many areas, including determining [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) payments, which are cash payments by corporations paid to shareholders.\n\nIn insurance, pro rata is used to determine the amount of [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp) due for a policy that only covers a partial term. Allocating the appropriate portion of an annual interest rate to a shorter time frame can also be done via pro rata.\n\nPro rata is also used to determine how much of a distribution from a qualified retirement account—such as an IRA, SEP, or 401(k)—is taxable when the account contains before and after-tax dollars.1 For example, an account holder has a 401(k) funded with 20% pre-tax dollars and 80% post-tax dollars. As a result, withdrawals will consist of 20% taxable and 80% non-taxable money.\n\n## Pro Rata and Dividends per Shareholder\n\nWhen a company pays dividends to its shareholders, each investor is paid according to its holdings. If a company has 100 [shares outstanding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp), for example, and issues a dividend of $2 per share, the total amount of dividends paid will be $200. No matter how many shareholders there are, the total dividend payments cannot exceed this limit. In this case, $200 is the whole, and the pro rata calculation must be used to determine the appropriate portion of that whole due to each shareholder.\n\nAssume there are only four shareholders who hold 50, 25, 15, and 10 shares, respectively. The amount due to each shareholder is their pro rata share. This is calculated by dividing the ownership of each person by the total number of shares and then multiplying the resulting fraction by the total amount of the dividend payment.\n\nThe [majority shareholder's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/majorityshareholder.asp) portion, therefore, is (50 / 100) x $200 = $100. This makes sense because the shareholder owns half of the shares and receives half of the total dividends. The remaining shareholders get $50, $30, and $20, respectively.\n\n## Pro Rata for Insurance Premiums\n\nAnother common use is to determine the amount due for a partial insurance policy term. Most insurance policies are based on a 12-month period, so if a policy is needed for a shorter term, the insurance company must prorate the annual premium to determine what is owed. To do this, divide the total premium by the number of days in a standard term, and multiply by the number of days covered by the truncated policy.\n\nFor example, assume an auto policy that typically covers a full year carries a premium of $1,000. If the insured only requires the policy for 270 days, then the company must reduce the premium accordingly. The pro rata premium due for this period is ($1,000 / 365) x 270 = $739.73.\n\n## Pro Rata for Interest Rates\n\nPro rata calculations are also used to determine the amount of interest that will be earned on an investment. If an investment earns an annual interest rate, then the pro rata amount earned for a shorter period is calculated by dividing the total amount of interest by the number of months in a year and multiplying by the number of months in the truncated period. The amount of interest earned in two months on an investment that yields 10% interest each year is (10% / 12) x 2 = 1.67%.\n\nWhen it comes to bonds, payment on [accrued interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruedinterest.asp) is calculated on a pro rata basis. Accrued interest is the total interest that has accumulated on a bond since its last coupon payment. When the bondholder sells the bond before the next coupon date, they're still entitled to the interest that accrues up until the time the bond is sold. The bond buyer, not the issuer, is responsible for paying the bond seller the accrued interest, which is added to the market price.\n\nThe formula for accrued interest is as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{AI} = \\\\text{Face Value of Bond} \\\\times \\\\text{Coupon Rate} \\\\times \\\\text{Time Factor} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{AI} = \\\\text{Accrued Interest} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Coupon Rate} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Annual Coupon Rate} }{ \\\\text{Number of Periods Per Year} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Time Factor} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Days Lapsed Since Last Payment} }{ \\\\text{Days in Payment Period} } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​AI=Face Value of Bond×Coupon Rate×Time Factorwhere:AI=Accrued InterestCoupon Rate=Number of Periods Per YearAnnual Coupon Rate​Time Factor=Days in Payment PeriodDays Lapsed Since Last Payment​​\n\nThe factor is calculated by dividing the length of time the bond was held after the last coupon payment by the time from one coupon payment to the next.\n\nFor example, consider a bondholder who sells their corporate bond on June 30. The bond has a face value of $1,000 and a 5% coupon rate, which pays semiannually on March 1 and Sept. 1. The buyer of the bond will pay the seller:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\$1,000 \\\\times \\\\frac { 5\\\\% } { 2 } \\\\times \\\\frac { 122 }{ 184 } = \\\\$16.58 \\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned}​$1,000×25%​×184122​=$16.58​\n\n## How Do You Calculate Pro Rata?\n\nNaturally, calculating the pro rata of different items varies since it calculates a proportion of a given whole. To calculate the prorated interest rate over six months, for instance, consider a company that charges 20% interest per year. Here, the prorated [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) would be calculated as (20% / 12) x 6 = 10%. \n\n## How Does Pro Rata Apply to Dividends Per Share?\n\nWhen a company distributes dividends, typically it is executed on a pro rata basis. For example, consider a majority shareholder, such as a founder or key executive, who owns 50% of a company's total 1,000 shares and the company is issuing a $1 dividend. Of the $1,000 in dividends, the majority shareholder would receive $500 in value. The formula would be as follows: (50 / 100) x $1,000 = $500. \n\n## What Is a Pro Rata Discount?\n\nA pro rata discount is a type of discount a merchant offers a customer. Companies offer customers [discounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discount.asp) for a variety of reasons. They may offer a discount as an incentive to a new customer to try a product or service. They may offer a discount if the customer makes a purchase during a specific time period or as a bonus to a returning customer.\n\nThe pro rata part of the discount varies depending on how the merchant has structured their offer. For example, a merchant may offer a new customer $20 off their first purchase of products if they spend $100 or more. If the customer buys four products, each item would receive a $5 discount.\n\nA pro rata discount could also apply if a customer joins a monthly [subscription service](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042715/how-do-subscription-business-models-work.asp) on any day other than the first of the month. Rather than charging the customer the full subscription price for the month, the merchant would apply a pro rata discount and only charge the customer for the number of days in the month they actually had the service.", "timestamp": 1655171726, "digest": "JHKrgLiRrGz-UINVAo2X6L9k7Hjgm7wRnC37eHu6UlU", "contributor": "0xa6dc3e455F584E4C68Ab8b0eE17f5e19196059a8"}

{"id": "3DV5RcDXBSGroBqIjd1OJC_XlUOA_clzB8twiqlQTI8", "title": "Kiddie Tax", "body": "## What Is the Kiddie Tax?\n\nThe kiddie tax is a special [tax law](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-code.asp) created in 1986 to address investment and unearned [income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp) for individuals 18 years of age or under—or dependent full-time students under age 24.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The kiddie tax prevents parents from avoiding taxes by transferring large gifts of stock.\n* All unearned income over the threshold is taxed at the parent’s marginal income tax rate rather than the lower child’s tax rate.\n* It applies to all children who are 18 years of age or under—or dependent full-time students between the ages of 19 and 24.\n* The kiddie tax applies to most unearned income that a child receives and does not apply to any salary or wages.\n* In 2022, unearned income under $1,150 qualifies for the standard deduction under kiddie tax law.12\n\n## How the Kiddie Tax Works\n\nThe kiddie tax is imposed on individuals under a certain age (18 years old or under and full-time students age 19-24 years old), whose investment and [unearned income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unearnedincome.asp) is higher than an annually determined threshold.1\n\nThis rule is designed to prevent parents from exploiting a [tax loophole](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loophole.asp) where their children are given large gifts of stock. In this case, the child would then [realize any gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realizedprofit.asp) from the investments and would be taxed at a far lower rate compared to the rate the guardians face for their realized stock gains.\n\nUnder the kiddie tax law, all unearned income over the threshold is taxed at the parent's marginal income [tax rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxrate.asp) rather than the child's tax rate. In 2021, unearned income under $1,100 qualifies for the [standard deduction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp). The next $1,100 is taxed at the child's tax rate, which is very low—sometimes 0%—and then anything over $2,200 is taxed at the guardian's tax rate, which could be as high as 37%.13\n\nIn 2022, unearned income under $1,150 qualifies for the standard deduction, and the next $1,150 is taxed at the child's tax rate.2\n\n### Who and What the Kiddie Tax Applies to\n\nAs of 2021, the kiddie tax applies to all children aged 18 and under at the end of the tax year and children who are dependent [full-time students](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fulltimestudent.asp) between the ages of 19 and 24. However, it does not apply to children under these ages who are married and file [joint tax returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointreturn.asp).1\n\nThe kiddie tax includes unearned income a child receives: interest, dividends, capital gains, rent, and royalties. Any salary or wages the child earns is not subject to the kiddie tax.1\n\nAdult children who turn 19—or 25 in the case of dependent full-time students—by the end of the tax year are not subject to the kiddie tax.1 \n\n## History of the Kiddie Tax\n\nThe tax law originally only covered children under 14 years of age. Children under the age of 14 cannot legally work, which means that any income they received usually came from [dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) or interest from [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). However, the tax authorities realized that some guardians would take advantage of the situation and then [give stock gifts](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/giftofstock.asp) to their older, 16-to-18-year-old children.4\n\nThe kiddie tax is imposed on individuals 18 years old or under whose investment and unearned income is higher than an annually determined threshold. The IRS taxes any income exceeding the predetermined threshold at the parent's tax rate. The [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/how-gop-tax-bill-affects-you/) temporarily changed the kiddie tax to use the tax rates that apply to estates and trusts rather than the tax rate of the child's parents.5\n\nHowever, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act 2020 retroactively changed it back to the parent's tax rate. For 2018 and 2019 returns, taxpayers could use either the estate tax rates or the parent's take rate for calculating the kiddie tax. For 2020 and beyond, the parent's tax rate applies.61\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvE8vOlHvh5Rg_oHe4CwJgvqB1bZdn7YPdvv1zhk9fD40f2TAXc5jVkVND7bycRzmdczGjbSZvNbajnZRZ5z4YUwu0Iro9e5W81qu213ikKZaWMnvSKp-XNM43L-ST3TObe9dy61tuNFqZdKATRm4gZx8-b9oPebav_9dWcloKKycNQDiUmvfWGT9BM_T1Yp-zcgNxJt5VONs9MX2_uYCupJByJJlBazfeDP3SVVuJ4M8csPphVAWKekb4JQZyVwBiylB_JSk_rqDCYngEAIlavotq1VXnLY9FgN_KEXzfWgiZAbdcdIQkGAr0My7Fu2_YFgatFaJ670Kqfe5ba3w&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAcx_GQrvcO-EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvE8vOlHvh5Rg_oHe4CwJgvqB1bZdn7YPdvv1zhk9fD40f2TAXc5jVkVND7bycRzmdczGjbSZvNbajnZRZ5z4YUwu0Iro9e5W81qu213ikKZaWMnvSKp-XNM43L-ST3TObe9dy61tuNFqZdKATRm4gZx8-b9oPebav_9dWcloKKycNQDiUmvfWGT9BM_T1Yp-zcgNxJt5VONs9MX2_uYCupJByJJlBazfeDP3SVVuJ4M8csPphVAWKekb4JQZyVwBiylB_JSk_rqDCYngEAIlavotq1VXnLY9FgN_KEXzfWgiZAbdcdIQkGAr0My7Fu2_YFgatFaJ670Kqfe5ba3w&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAcx_GQrvcO-EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "HdtoXspFPc-pCd6SGMPfVN96tgiAB9hLEEJ_NUHuZbs", "title": "Kids in Parents' Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings (KIPPERS)", "body": "## What Is Kids in Parents' Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings (KIPPERS)?\n\nKids In Parents' Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings (KIPPERS) is a slang term for adult children who are still living at home with their parents even after finishing school and reaching working age. Their parents face the challenges of managing their own finances and planning for retirement while dealing with the added expense of housing and feeding their adult offspring.\n\nKIPPERS are also known as [boomerang children](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boomerangs.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Kids in Parents' Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings (KIPPERS) is a slang term for adult children who are still living at home with their parents even after finishing school and reaching working age.\n* Parents may enjoy having their KIPPERS at home, but it can cause a financial strain due to the added costs of housing one or more children.\n* It may also force them to delay their own big decisions, such as downsizing, moving to a better climate, and retiring.\n* Parents should help their KIPPERS prepare for independent life by establishing rules, charging rent, and helping them manage costs and debt.\n\n## Understanding Kids in Parents' Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings (KIPPERS)\n\nAccording to some studies, most parents find that having KIPPERS in the house is a pleasant experience. They like living with their adult children and the opportunity to build deeper relationships with them now that they are adults. The extra time spent at home allows for a closer relationship, in many instances.\n\nHowever, it usually results in the parents spending more and saving less than they otherwise would as they approach retirement age. Additional costs include extra groceries for feeding additional mouths, continuing to stay in a larger house as opposed to downsizing when the kids have moved out, and other possible costs depending on the situation of the child, such as an additional car or spending money. They may also postpone retirement itself, working many more years just to support their children.\n\nContrast this to the situation of a married dual-income couple with no children at home, whose discretionary income is often higher, and who find saving for retirement easier. This demographic group is sometimes referred to as [Dual Income No Kids](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dinks.asp) (DINKs).\n\n## Millennials on the Couch\n\nA Pew Research Center study in 2016 found that nearly one-third of 18- to 34-year-olds lived with at least one parent, up from just 20% in 1960. \"For the first time in 130 years, shacking up with Mom and/or Dad was the most common living arrangement for young adults, edging out being married/cohabitating, living alone, or living with someone other than a parent,\" [Consumer Reports](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-reports.asp) noted.12\n\nIn 2020, Pew Research showed that 52% of young adults in the U.S. were living with their parents. This was a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the number was still high before the pandemic in February 2020, at 47%.3\n\nFor parents struggling to [save for retirement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement-planning.asp) and contain costs, Consumer Reports offered these tips:\n\n* Don't allow freeloading. Make sure your adult children are financially responsible by setting goals, discussing household costs, and assigning their share, even if they don't have the money to pay for them right now.\n* Talk about timelines for leaving the nest, and educate them about the costs of living.\n* Encourage your children to establish credit of their own so that one day they'll be able to qualify for their own place.\n* Consider charging rent.\n\n## Why Are They Here?\n\nThere are many factors that result in adult children living with their parents. Millennials were hard hit with the [financial crisis of 2008](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp) and now by the pandemic caused by the Coronavirus. These two events caused many young adults to be [laid off](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/layoff.asp), losing out on time to build savings.\n\nIn addition, the jobs many younger people can get don't pay well enough to allow them to live on their own.

{"id": "I1CUpqyqszGWIhAaylTdR9Bded1Zwr6BHXMSm09nY90", "title": "Kiting", "body": "## What Is Kiting?\n\nKiting is the fraudulent use of a financial instrument to obtain additional credit that is not authorized. Kiting encompasses two main types of fraud:\n\n* Issuing or altering a check or bank draft, for which there are [insufficient funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nsf.asp).\n* Misrepresenting the value of a [financial instrument](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp) for the purpose of extending credit obligations or increasing financial [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Kiting involves the illegal use of financial instruments to fraudulently obtain additional credit.\n* Securities firms \"kite\" if they fail to follow SEC rules around obtaining securities in a timely way.\n* Check kiting targets banks or retailers through a series of bad checks, sometimes drawn on multiple accounts.\n\n## Check Kiting Involving Banks\n\nCarried out within the banking system, kiting typically involves passing a series of checks at two or more banking institutions, using accounts that have insufficient funds. Relying on the [float time](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/float.asp) required for a check deposited at one bank to clear at another, the kiter typically writes a check at the first bank against an account at the other.\n\nBefore that check clears, they then withdraw the funds from the second bank account and deposit the funds back into the first. The process may then be repeated in the opposite order, sometimes repeatedly. The net result is a series of fraudulent withdrawals that rely on being a step ahead of the fraudulent check on which they are based having cleared.\n\nReduced times for checks to clear has helped reduce the incidence of check kiting involving banks, as have such practices as banks placing holds on deposited funds and charging for returned checks.\n\n## Retail Kiting\n\nA variant of check kiting is known as \"retail kiting.\" This relies on cashing a bad check (number one) at a retailer to purchase an item. Then, before that check has cleared, the kiter writes another check (number two), which may include (or entirely comprise) a cashback payment. While [cashback](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-back.asp) is now most often associated with debit cards, some retailers still offer this convenience with checks.\n\nThe cash from check number two is then deposited into the account, to allow check number one to clear. The fraud is then repeated in order to cover check number two and may be sustained in order to stay ahead of the float and fraudulently obtain a series of items and cash withdrawals.\n\n## Kiting With Securities\n\nKiting that involves misrepresenting securities generally occurs when securities firms flout [SEC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) regulations regarding the timely delivery of buy-and-sell transactions, which must be completed within a three-day settlement period.1 If a firm fails to receive the securities within that timeframe, it is required to purchase the shortage on the [open market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp) and charge the delinquent firm for any associated fees.\n\nThe delinquent firm is considered to be practicing the fraudulent act of kiting if it fails to purchase the securities on the open market and maintains a [short position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp), delays delivery, or takes part in transactions contrary to the proper settlement of trades.2\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "njNNYobZxKzcf_K8FGDC9c5YD0OPxlJjmhSSq3ctOLM", "title": "CONSENSUS 2022 on Going：A Review on the Agenda for Day 2", "body": "Consensus 2022 is in full swing! Follow Concept Art House to see what's on the agenda for Day 2.\n\nFirst, we participate in a panel with World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov and Emily Parker. Garry discusses real world use cases for how crypto is being used for humanitarian efforts. In previous news reports, Garry said he wouldn't be surprised if cryptocurrencies replaced the U.S. dollar within 10 years. Garry Kasparov argues that BTC is \"digital gold\" that can hold its value if inflation rises. \"In the United States and Europe, there has been a lot of issuance of dollars, and basically the dollar is devalued,\" he says. Meanwhile, Garry Kasparov also sees technology as a way to protect hard-won wealth. BTC is what he sees as digital gold, and other cryptocurrencies are the way to the future.\n\nNext agenda was in Washington’s Crypto Awakening: The Lawmaker Town Hall , where many different participants expressed their views on the current crypto environment. Senator Gilsten Gillibrand said: \"We’ve added layers and definitions to the Howey Test…so this industry can continue to thrive and innovate..\"\n\nPat Toomey, a Republican US senator, said: \"I’m more optimistic than most… having a legislative framework in place will stop the competitive turfs. I’m bullish on stablecoins but we need regulatory certainty on the space. I think we will get stablecoins regulation done this year.\"\n\nPatrickMcHenry, a citizen from North Carolina’s 10th District in the United States Congress, said: \"There is no federal definition for what is a stablecoin… the definition and treatment for digital assets is important to get right. Next year we will have multiple bills that deal with the financial assets category. I’m optimistic.\"\n\nAt the same time, Senator Gilsten Gillibrand added: \"We are working together (the 4 of us) to move forward to get the conversations happening now (on stablecoins).\"\n\nAbout Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's CCO said that there are similarities with Consensus 2018. But, but this year's event is different in many aspects. This year’s Consensus is the first in-person iteration of the conference since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The most recent attendance number I’ve heard for this year’s event is 17,000.\n\nAn even more interesting comparison to 2018 is the vibes, man. The 2018 event\n\ncame after a brutal market crash, with bitcoin (BTC) trading at about $6,600 during the event (down 66% from the local peak just shy of $20,000 the preceding December). The mood was fairly grim. This year’s event was also preceded by a market crash. Bitcoin is down 57% from its all-time high of $67,000 set last November. But unlike in 2018, it’s hard to find a downcast eye or frowning face at Consensus 2022.\n\nThe convention center is packed with curious attendees hungry for knowledge about decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), Ethereum scaling solutions and all kinds of relatively arcane, future-forward or speculative matters that don’t have much to do with the current market but could pay off big-time in the long run. It’s true that markets in crypto are highly tied to sentiment – but for the most dedicated, it’s increasingly clear that sentiment isn’t entirely tied to markets. And that group is growing.\n\nAnother notable new presence at Consensus: real, widespread, in-your-face diversity. We’ve been talking for years about how the openness of crypto would make it accessible for a much broader spectrum of people, and we’re starting to see that really happen.\n\nConsensus 2022 is still on going. What will happen next? Let's look forward to it......\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1655172073, "digest": "QJgVvFlroayFRMkRZJ8E3aYPzrEs4bdPrQpOkelv-BM", "contributor": "0x5BCEFD7FadDFfc1B9259534075305Fd11d61C8FA"}
{"id": "otYRNjmrZGlX8c76VloqE2-8X9o0DucGVpoBJkWzq2c", "title": "Promissory Note", "body": "## What Is a Promissory Note?\n\nA promissory note is a [debt instrument](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtinstrument.asp) that contains a written promise by one party (the note's issuer or maker) to pay another party (the note's payee) a definite sum of money, either on-demand or at a specified future date. A promissory note typically contains all the terms pertaining to the indebtedness, such as the principal amount, interest rate, maturity date, date and place of issuance, and issuer's signature.\n\nAlthough financial institutions may issue them—for instance, you might be required to sign a promissory note in order to take out a [small personal loan](https://www.investopedia.com/best-small-personal-loans-4797188)—promissory notes usually allow companies and individuals to get financing from a source other than a bank. This source can be an individual or a company willing to carry the note (and provide the financing) under the agreed-upon terms. In effect, promissory notes can enable anyone to be a lender.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A promissory note is a financial instrument that contains a written promise by one party (the note's issuer or maker) to pay another party (the note's payee) a definite sum of money, either on demand or at a specified future date.\n* A promissory note typically contains all the terms pertaining to the indebtedness, such as the principal amount, interest rate, maturity date, date and place of issuance, and issuer's signature.\n* In terms of their legal enforceability, promissory notes lie somewhere between the informality of an IOU and the rigidity of a loan contract.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 29 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:29\n\n#### Promissory Note\n\n## How Promissory Notes Work\n\nPromissory notes, as well as [bills of exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billofexchange.asp), are governed by the 1930 Geneva Convention of Uniform Law on Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes.1 Its rules also stipulate that the term \"promissory note\" should be inserted in the body of the instrument and should contain an unconditional promise to pay.\n\nIn terms of their legal enforceability, promissory notes lie somewhere between the informality of an [IOU](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iou.asp) and the rigidity of a loan contract. A promissory note includes a specific promise to pay, and the steps required to do so (like the repayment schedule), while an IOU merely acknowledges that a debt exists, and the amount one party owes another.\n\nA loan contract, on the other hand, usually states the lender's right to recourse—such as [foreclosure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp)—in the event of default by the borrower; such provisions are generally absent in a promissory note. While the paper might make note of the consequences of non-payment or untimely payments (such as late fees), it does not usually explain methods of recourse if the issuer does not pay on time.\n\nPromissory notes that are unconditional and saleable become [negotiable instruments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negotiable-instrument.asp) that are extensively used in business transactions in numerous countries.\n\n### Student Loan Promissory Notes\n\nMany people sign their first promissory notes as part of the process of getting a [student loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/student-debt.asp). Private lenders typically require students to sign promissory notes for each separate loan that they take out. Some schools, however, allow federal student loan borrowers to sign a one-time, master promissory note. After that, the student borrower can receive multiple federal student loans as long as the school certifies the student's continued eligibility.\n\nStudent loan promissory notes outline the rights and responsibilities of student borrowers as well as the conditions and terms of the loan. By signing a master promissory note for [federal student loans](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/042415/earn-credit-card-rewards-paying-student-loans.asp), for instance, the student promises to repay the loan amounts plus interest and fees to the U.S. Department of Education.2 The master promissory note also includes the student's personal contact and employment information as well as the names and contact info for the student's personal references.\n\n## A Brief History of Promissory Notes\n\nPromissory notes have had an interesting history. At times, they have circulated as a form of alternate currency, free of government control. In some places, the official currency is in fact a form of promissory note called a [demand note ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demandnote.asp)(one with no stated maturity date or fixed-term, allowing the lender to decide when to demand payment).\n\nIn the United States, however, promissory notes are usually issued only to corporate clients and sophisticated investors. Recently, however, promissory notes have also been also seeing increasing use when it comes to selling homes and securing mortgages.\n\nA promissory note is usually held by the party owed money; once the debt has been fully discharged, it must be canceled by the payee and returned to the issuer.\n\n## Mortgages vs. Promissory Notes\n\nHomeowners usually think of their [mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/first_mortgage.asp) as an obligation to repay the money they borrowed to buy their residence. But actually, it's a promissory note they also sign, as part of the financing process, that represents that promise to pay back the loan, along with the repayment terms. The promissory note stipulates the size of the debt, its interest rate, and late fees. In this case, the lender holds the promissory note until the mortgage loan is paid off. Unlike the [deed of trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustdeed.asp) or mortgage itself, the promissory note is not entered into county land records.\n\nThe promissory note can also be a way in which people who don't qualify for a mortgage can purchase a home. The mechanics of the deal, commonly called a [take-back mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vendor_take_back.asp), are quite simple: The seller continues to hold the mortgage (taking it back) on the residence, and the buyer signs a promissory note saying that they will pay the price of the house plus an agreed-upon interest rate in regular installments. The payments from the promissory note often result in positive monthly cash flow for the seller.\n\nUsually, the buyer will make a large down payment to bolster the seller's confidence in the buyer's ability to make future payments. Although it varies by situation and state, the deed of the house is often used as a form of [collateral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp) and it reverts back to the seller if the buyer can't make the payments. There are cases in which a third party acts as the creditor in a take-back mortgage instead of the seller, but this can make matters more complex and prone to legal problems in the case of default.\n\n### The Tax Perspective\n\nFrom the perspective of the homeowner who wants to sell, the composition of the promissory note is quite important. It is better, from a tax perspective, to get a higher sales price for your home and charge the buyer a lower interest rate. This way, the capital gains will be tax-free on the sale of the home, but the interest on the note will be taxed.\n\nConversely, a low sales price and a high-interest rate are better for the buyer because they will be able to write off the interest and, after faithfully paying the seller for a year or so, [refinance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp) at a lower interest rate through a traditional mortgage from a bank. Ironically, now that the buyer has built up equity in the house, they probably won't have an issue getting financing from the bank to buy it.\n\n## Types of Promissory Notes\n\n### Corporate Credit Promissory Notes\n\nPromissory notes are commonly used in business as a means of short-term financing. For example, when a company has sold many products but has not yet collected payments for them, it may become low on cash and unable to pay creditors. In this case, it may ask them to accept a promissory note that can be exchanged for cash at a future time after it collects its [accounts receivables](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp). Alternatively, it may ask the bank for the cash in exchange for a promissory note to be paid back in the future.\n\nPromissory notes also offer a credit source for companies that have exhausted other options, like corporate loans or bond issues. A note issued by a company in this situation is at a higher risk of default than, say, a corporate bond. This also means the interest rate on a corporate promissory note is likely to provide a greater return than a bond from the same company—high-risk means higher potential returns.\n\nThese notes usually have to be registered with the government in the state in which they are sold and/or with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).3 Regulators will review the note to decide whether the company is capable of meeting its promises. If the note is not registered, the investor has to do their own analysis as to whether the company is capable of servicing the debt. In this case, the investor's legal avenues may be somewhat limited in the case of default. Companies in dire straits may hire high-[commission brokers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission-broker.asp) to push unregistered notes on the public.\n\n### Investment Promissory Notes\n\nInvesting in promissory notes, even in the case of a take-back mortgage, involves risk. To help minimize these risks, an investor needs to register the note or have it notarized so that the obligation is both publicly recorded and legal. Also, in the case of the take-back mortgage, the purchaser of the note may even go so far as to take out an insurance policy on the issuer's life. This is perfectly acceptable because if the issuer dies, the holder of the note will assume ownership of the house and related expenses that they may not be prepared to handle.\n\nThese notes are only offered to corporate or sophisticated investors who can handle the risks and have the money needed to buy the note (notes can be issued for as large a sum as the buyer is willing to carry). After an investor has agreed to the conditions of a promissory note, they can sell it (or even the individual payments from it), to yet another investor, much like a security.\n\nNotes sell for a discount from their face value because of the effects of [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) eating into the value of future payments. Other investors can also do a partial purchase of the note, buying the rights to a certain number of payments—once again, at a discount to the true value of each payment. This allows the note holder to raise a lump sum of money quickly, rather than waiting for payments to accumulate.\n\n## Investing in Promissory Notes\n\nBy bypassing banks and traditional lenders, investors in promissory notes are taking on the risk of the banking industry without having the organizational size to minimize that risk by spreading it out over thousands of loans. This risk translates into larger returns—provided that the payee doesn't [default ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp)on the note.\n\nIn the corporate world, such notes are rarely sold to the public. When they are, it is usually at the behest of a struggling company working through unscrupulous brokers who are willing to sell promissory notes that the company may not be able to honor.\n\nIn the case of take-back mortgages, promissory notes have become a valuable tool to complete sales that would otherwise be held up by a lack of financing. This can be a win-win situation for both the seller and buyer, as long as both parties fully understand what they are getting into.\n\nIf you are looking to perform a take-back mortgage purchase or sale, you should have a talk with a legal professional and visit the notary office before you sign anything.\n\n## What Does a Promissory Note Contain?\n\nA form of debt instrument, a promissory note represents a written promise on the part of the issuer to pay back another party. A promissory note will include the agreed-upon terms between the two parties, such as the maturity date, principal, interest, and issuer’s signature. Essentially, a promissory note allows entities aside from financial institutions the ability to provide lending mechanisms to other entities. \n\n## What Is an Example of a Promissory Note?\n\nOne example of a promissory note is a corporate credit promissory note. For this type of promissory note, a company will be typically seeking a short-term loan. In the case of a growing startup that is low on cash as it expands its operations, terms of the agreement could follow that the company pays back the loan once its accounts receivable are collected.\n\nThere are a number of other different types of promissory notes including investment promissory notes, take-back mortgages, and student loan promissory notes. \n\n## What Are the Pros and Cons of a Promissory Note?\n\nA promissory note can be advantageous when an entity is unable to find a loan from a traditional lender, such as a bank. However, promissory notes can be much riskier because the lender does not have the means and scale of resources found within financial institutions. At the same time, legal issues could arise for both the issuer and payee in the event of default.

{"id": "SpzPrQqadGCFigmbqbXxGPrt3qZeHMhfkU8KHcKUSCE", "title": "Prospectus", "body": "## What Is a Prospectus?\n\nA prospectus is a formal document that is required by and filed with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) that provides details about an investment offering to the public. A prospectus is filed for offerings of stocks, bonds, and [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp).\n\nThe prospectus can help investors make more informed investment decisions because it contains a host of relevant information about the investment or security.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that security issuers file a prospectus when offering investment securities to the public.\n* The prospectus provides details about the investment/security and the offering.\n* A mutual fund prospectus contains details on investment objectives, strategies, performance, distribution policy, fees, and fund management. \n* The risks of the investment are typically disclosed early in the prospectus and then explained in more detail later in the document.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 49 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:49\n\n#### Prospectus\n\n## Understanding Prospectus\n\nCompanies that wish to offer bonds or [stock for sale to the public](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) must file a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of the registration process. Companies must file a preliminary and final prospectus, and the SEC has specific guidelines as to what's listed in the prospectus for various securities.\n\nThe [preliminary prospectus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preliminaryprospectus.asp) is the first offering document provided by a security issuer and includes most of the details of the business and transaction. However, the preliminary prospectus doesn't contain the number of shares to be issued or price information. Typically, the preliminary prospectus is used to gauge interest in the market for the security being proposed.\n\nThe final prospectus contains the complete details of the investment offering to the public. The final prospectus includes any finalized background information, as well as the number of shares or certificates to be issued and the [offering price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offeringprice.asp).\n\nA prospectus includes some of the following information:\n\n* A brief summary of the company’s background and financial information\n* The name of the company issuing the stock\n* The number of shares\n* Type of securities being offered\n* Whether an offering is [public or private](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021015/what-difference-between-ipo-and-private-placement.asp)\n* Names of the company’s principals\n* Names of the banks or financial companies performing the [underwriting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp)\n\nSome companies are allowed to file an abridged prospectus, which is a document that contains some of the same information as the [final prospectus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finalprospectus.asp).\n\nAnother reason a prospectus is issued is to inform investors of the risks involved with investing in the security or fund. Although a company might be raising capital through stock or bond issuance, investors should study the [financials of the company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) to ensure the company is financially viable enough to honor its commitments.\n\nRisks are typically disclosed early in the prospectus and [described in more detail](https://www.investopedia.com/ipos-4689824) later. The age of the company, management experience, management's involvement in the business, and [capitalization of the stock issuer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) are also described. The prospectus information also guards the issuing company against claims that pertinent information was not fully disclosed.1\n\n## Prospectus Example\n\nIn the case of mutual funds, a prospectus contains details on the fund's objectives, [investment strategies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstrategy.asp), risks, performance, distribution policy, fees, expenses, and fund management. Because the fees that mutual funds charge take away from investors’ returns, the fees are listed in a table near the beginning of the prospectus. Fees for purchases, sales, and moving among funds are also included, which simplifies the process of comparing the costs of various mutual funds.2\n\n### 1% to 2%\n\n*Typically, high-cost funds charge fees in excess of 1.5%, whereas low-cost funds charge 1% or less.*\n\nAs an example of a prospectus for an offering, PNC Financial ([PNC](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=PNC)) filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 requesting a new issuance of debt. The senior note being offered to the public is a bond or a [promissory note](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp) to pay a specific yield by maturity.\n\nFor review, [senior notes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seniornote.asp) are debt securities, or bonds, that take precedence over other unsecured notes in the event of bankruptcy. Senior notes must be paid first if assets are available in the event of company liquidation. A senior note pays a lower [coupon rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp) of interest compared to junior unsecured bonds since the senior debt has a higher level of security and a reduced risk of default.\n\nBelow is a portion of the prospectus from the table of contents, which provides basic information about the offering.3 We can see the following information listed:\n\n* Securities offered, which are senior notes that pay 3.50%\n* The [maturity date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp) of the notes, which is Jan. 23, 2024\n* The issue date, which has yet to be determined\n* How interest will be paid and denominations to be issued\n* Use of proceeds or how the money raised will be spent, which might include financing operations, paying down debt, or [buying back stock](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp)\n\nPNC Financial Prospectus Example.  Investopedia\n\n## Why Is a Prospectus Useful for Investors?\n\nA prospectus is a formal document that is required by and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that provides details about an investment offering to the public. It is very useful to investors as it informs them of the risks involved with investing in the security or fund. Risks are typically disclosed early in the prospectus and described in more detail later. Although a company might be raising capital through stock or bond issuance, investors should study the financials of the company to ensure the company is financially viable enough to honor its commitments.\n\n## What Information Is Normally in a Prospectus?\n\nA prospectus includes pertinent information such as a brief summary of the company’s background and financial information. The name of the company and its principals, age of the company, management experience, and management's involvement in the business. Furthermore, the number of shares being issued, the type of securities being offered, whether an offering is public or private, and the names of the banks or financial companies performing the underwriting are also listed.\n\n## What's the Difference Between a Preliminary and Final Prospectus?\n\nThe preliminary prospectus is the first offering document provided by a security issuer and includes most of the details of the business and transaction. However, the preliminary prospectus doesn't contain the number of shares to be issued or price information. Typically, the preliminary prospectus is used to gauge interest in the market for the security being proposed.\n\nThe final prospectus contains the complete details of the investment offering to the public. The final prospectus includes any finalized background information, as well as the number of shares or certificates to be issued and the offering price.", "timestamp": 1655172016, "digest": "QcoFGrY2X2IX0sr8eCgthm1CvggqdIcggID1zBaV9_E", "contributor": "0x9a9f36B3d77544928742739B3114A78d23850C78"}
{"id": "ZV2HsGnAEHVD87hINdgDVkY7BhxKfs-rsrWaJ6wBSMw", "title": "Kiosk", "body": "## What Is a Kiosk?\n\nA kiosk refers to a small, temporary, stand-alone booth used in high-traffic areas for marketing purposes. A kiosk is usually manned by one or two individuals who help attract attention to the booth to get new customers. Retail kiosks are frequently located in shopping malls or on busy city streets with significant [foot traffic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foot-traffic.asp) and provide owners with a low-cost alternative to market their products or services.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A kiosk refers to a small, temporary, stand-alone booth used in high-traffic areas for marketing purposes.\n* Kiosks may be manned by one or two individuals or may be electronic.\n* These booths are considered to be low-cost marketing strategies that are great alternatives for new, emerging entrepreneurs.\n* The different types of kiosks include employment kiosks, foodservice kiosks, healthcare kiosks, Bitcoin kiosks, and photo kiosks.\n* Kiosks can help raise brand awareness and provide an interactive way for consumers to engage with a company. They can also be frustrating if they are not maintained properly thereby hurting a brand's image.\n\n## Understanding Kiosks\n\nKiosks are generally small booths set up in high-traffic areas. You may see them in the walkways of shopping centers. They may be manned by individuals who sell a product or service; anything from toys and hair care products to insurance or [credit cards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp).\n\nKiosks are not always supervised by humans. Some, in fact, are electronic, providing consumers with a self-service-style experience. These kiosks normally complement an existing service already offered by the kiosk owner. For example, some provincial government agencies in Canada allow the general public to perform certain tasks like renewing car registration or updating personal information for health cards and driver's licenses using electronic kiosks that act much like [automated teller machines](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atm.asp) (ATMs). This allows the consumer to execute these tasks on their own without having to wait in line at a provincial ministry.\n\nBecause of their small, temporary natures, kiosks can be low-cost marketing strategies. Malls and other [lessors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lessor.asp) may charge a smaller amount of rent to kiosk owners who might not need or afford a larger retail space. Kiosks can be a great way for new, emerging [entrepreneurs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp) to give their businesses a kickstart without sacrificing cost. That's because they give companies a human face and provide customers with the opportunity to ask questions about their products. Electronic kiosks give consumers a hassle-free, convenient experience.\n\n## History of Kiosks\n\nKiosks in the form of simple stalls or booths have been around for hundreds of years in one form or another. The first vending machines date back to the 1880s, which is when the idea of self-service was first brought to the public. These vending machines sold simple items, such as gum and postcards.1\n\nATMs first came into use in the 1960s and set the template for how kiosks are known today. These types of machines took a while to catch on as individuals still preferred conducting financial transactions in person.\n\nIn 1970, IBM partnered with American Airlines and American Express to create the first airline ticket self-service kiosk. In 1977, the first complete self-service interactive kiosk was established at the University of Illinois, providing campus information to students and visitors.1\n\nIn 1985, the Florsheim Shoe Company established the first network of kiosks. It consisted of 600 kiosks where shoppers could search for shoes in other locations, pay for them, and have them directly shipped to their homes.1\n\n## Types of Kiosks\n\nKiosks vary based on the nature of the [business](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business.asp) and whether the owner intends to make it electronic or man it with individuals. The location generally has a relation to the nature of the kiosk as well. A local newspaper might set up a kiosk at a grocery store to sign up new subscribers. Similarly, credit card companies often set up kiosks in airports to seek new customers for a credit card that offers frequent-flyer miles.\n\n### Employment Kiosks\n\nIn addition to kiosks that sell retail products or services, some companies set up employment kiosks where job seekers can apply for work. This type of kiosk is especially common in chain stores such as Walmart. Employment kiosks provide a way to quickly identify promising candidates, who will often receive an interview on the spot.\n\nThe kiosk may include a computer station at which the applicant can use a keyboard or touchscreen to input their employment history, education, and personal data. Some employment kiosks also administer assessment tests to help determine an applicant's strengths and weaknesses. Information collected at the kiosk is frequently available to the hiring manager almost immediately.\n\n### Food Service Kiosks\n\nIn an effort to streamline the process of taking food orders, some restaurants install self-service kiosks. Customers can follow interactive prompts to select their meal and customize their order. The kiosks usually accept credit or [debit cards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debitcard.asp), eliminating the need for a human cashier. When restaurants use kiosks, the need for counter personnel is reduced, lowering payroll costs for the company.\n\n### Healthcare Kiosks\n\nThe healthcare industry is also starting to implement kiosks as a method for accepting bill payments, checking in patients for appointments, and patient record keeping. At some kiosks, patients can even take their own blood pressure or perform other non-invasive tests and then relay the results to their doctors. In some cases, medical kiosks also offer educational videos about medical conditions and their treatments.\n\nPatient kiosks can reduce medical costs by cutting down on paperwork and eliminating some clerical staff positions. Critics of medical kiosks are primarily concerned with patient confidentiality in their arguments against their use.\n\n### Bitcoin Kiosks\n\nA [Bitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp) kiosk, also known as a [Bitcoin ATM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-atm.asp), is a kiosk connected to the Internet that allows individuals to purchase Bitcoins and other [cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) with cash they have deposited. The kiosk permits users to create a blockchain-based transaction that will send a cryptocurrency to the user's digital wallet. The Bitcoin kiosks are not actually ATMs in that they do not allow for the withdrawal or deposit of cash but rather function as a means to connect to the Internet to purchase cryptocurrencies.\n\n### Photo Kiosks\n\nAlthough not as common as they once were, photo kiosks were popular in shopping centers in the 1980s and 1990s. For a small [fee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fee.asp), people could pose in front of a camera lens that would take three to four photographs. Customers waited for a few moments while the booth developed and ejected the photos. Automatic photo kiosks also serve another purpose, allowing people to develop and print their own photographs from DVDs, portable hard drives, and memory sticks.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Kiosks\n\n### Advantages\n\nThe primary advantage of a kiosk is that it improves the customer's shopping experience. Kiosks are easily accessible and the individuals working there are usually pleasant and ready to help, both of which make it simpler to provide the customer with detailed information on your product or service.\n\nAnother advantage is that because of their small size and ease of being built, kiosks can be strategically placed in a location that will receive a lot of foot traffic, thereby increasing your customer base. The more visible and accessible your business is, the likelier you will experience [growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthcompany.asp).\n\nKiosks can also reduce your business costs. The use of interactive kiosks removes the need for staff, thereby cutting down on employee wages and salaries. Kiosks also don't require the same costs of renting retail space in a shopping center or storefront, thereby reducing rental costs. The costs saved on labor and rent can be used in other aspects of growing your business, such as sales and [marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp).\n\nKiosks also work as a [branding](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/branding-ultimate-economic-moat.asp) tool and can help generate interest in your product. Uniquely designed kiosks, especially interactive ones, may attract new customers through sheer curiosity. A kiosk that provides a unique experience may generate goodwill with a consumer and raise awareness of your brand and product.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\nKiosks may keep those customers away that prefer to deal with actual people rather than machines. This is particularly true for self-service kiosks, which may sometimes be difficult to operate for those that are not tech-savvy and may increase their frustration.\n\nLarger, built-out kiosks may be difficult to move if needed as they are established in one place. This would require increased costs of taking it down and moving it or the need to build a new kiosk in another location.\n\nKiosks that do not have actual staff working there may be subject to an increase in crime, such as shoplifting and vandalism. This would require incorporating security measures, whether that be security alarms, cameras, or guards.\n\nKiosks will always require maintenance. Those that break down or have technical issues without an employee on hand to fix them or assist the shopper could hurt business and leave customers with a bad user experience, hurting your brand.\n\nPros\n\n* Improves customer shopping experience\n* Can increase customer base\n* Can reduce business costs\n* Helps improve branding\n\nCons\n\n* Can deter customers that prefer interacting with humans\n* Large, hardware-heavy kiosks can be expensive and difficult to move\n* Subject to shoplifting and vandalism\n* Kiosks with technical difficulties can hurt a brand\n\n## Kiosk FAQs\n\n### How Much Does It Cost to Rent a Kiosk at the Mall?\n\nThe cost depends on the location of the mall, the season of the year, and the product being sold. The cost is at least $800 per month but can reach the thousands. Some malls also ask for a percentage of sales.2\n\n### What Is a Global Entry Kiosk at the Airport?\n\nGlobal Entry is a program by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency that allows for expedited clearance for pre-approved travelers when they enter the U.S. There are self-service Global Entry kiosks at international airports in the U.S. that allow for entry after a quick approval.\n\n### What Can You Do at a USPS Self-Service Kiosk?\n\nThe USPS self-service kiosks allow for the purchase of stamps, the weighing of packages, the printing of Priority shipping labels, and the shipping of items.\n\n### What Is Kiosk Mode?\n\nKiosk mode is a mode that is offered by different web browsers. This allows the browser to be viewed in full screen without any other interface, such as a toolbar or menu. The purpose is to run the content on the entire screen and prevent the user from using the screen or kiosk for any other purpose.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nKiosks are small, temporary booths placed in areas with high foot traffic that are used by businesses to reach their customers in a more simple and informal manner. Kiosks are primarily used for marketing purposes and can be staffed by individuals or self-service. They are typically low-cost and help brands raise awareness of their products and services as well as allowing for an interactive way for consumers to engage with the company.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvz8GCP__wA5K4z9aT1jm3fAdqvsWjvnZtOJJwsrE-W_lVb74me9TZJRLf_djKeW698wOHrxDtd8TCkXfOj-rsCtH3NKfnfW2a-g8VICdzGQIRjg7ilG8LdbeN4u2NVc3m0lNH0Jm0KI5MCU7MfOiJXJeGmAymPqH39YdSeI3q1U01b8O6ODnlcOt59xO2qgnoTxkRYqPvx3WTAYJj_8ygIW7t4igP8Cs5kiv8X81Dxc9_2etinQPJxqmrasKtU1RUVmtMn6WMw66G_UbGDHQSQtDD9wxtwePdzh0keJuTpflHjW4tNqrqUMLdU9sAtXMQlpjiga1ENazcG1sDxpAJEO5DVtlINJIsZauD7&sig=Cg0ArKJSzFzySxyeYIN1EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

{"id": "E3gRkRwwVyZ_N2FOiHw2nsNUaDcZWiYqmJ1clcqMdDw", "title": "Public Limited Company (PLC)", "body": "## What Is a Public Limited Company (PLC)?\n\nA public limited company (PLC) is a public company in the United Kingdom. PLC is the equivalent of a U.S. publicly traded company that carries the Inc. or corporation designation. The use of the PLC abbreviation after the name of a company is mandatory and communicates to investors and to anyone dealing with the company that it is a publicly traded corporation.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* PLC, or public limited company, is the U.K. equivalent of the U.S. corporation or Inc.\n* All of the companies listed on the London Stock Exchange are PLCs.\n* The formal names of some familiar U.K. brands like Burberry and Shell include the suffix PLC.\n\n## How a Public Limited Company (PLC) Works\n\nA PLC designates a company that has offered shares of stock to the general public. The buyers of those shares have limited liability. Meaning, they cannot be held responsible for any business losses in excess of the amount they paid for the shares.\n\nIn the U.K., a PLC operates along similar lines as a public corporation in the U.S. Its operations are regulated and it is are required to publish periodic reports to shareholders and prospective shareholders on its true financial health.\n\n## Requirements for a PLC\n\nU.K. company law says that a PLC must have the PLC designation after the company name and minimum share capital of £50,000. Like a publicly traded company in the U.S., PLCs offer various types of shares, such as ordinary and cumulative preference shares. Ordinary shares of a PLC are similar to common stock issued by U.S. corporations.1\n\nCumulative preference shares are akin to preferred stock in the U.S. Other key requirements for a PLC include offering shares, appointing directors, and adhering to registration requirements. The PLC must also have PLC or public limited company as part of the name. \n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of a PLC\n\nThe biggest advantage of forming a public limited company (PLC) is that it grants the ability to raise capital by issuing public shares. A listing on a public stock exchange attracts interest from hedge funds, mutual funds, and professional traders as well as individual investors. That tends to lead to increased access to capital for investment in the company than a private limited company can amass.\n\nThe largest PLCs make up the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index, known as the Footsie.\n\nOn the other hand, there's much more regulation for a PLC in the U.K., as there is for a public corporation in the U.S. They are required to hold annual general meetings open to all shareholders and are held to higher standards of transparency in accounting. Because they’re public, they’re also vulnerable to pressure from shareholders and takeover bids from rivals.\n\nBy becoming a PLC, the company is given greater access to capital, and shareholders are offered liquidity. These are similar benefits of a company in the U.S. going public. On the downside, becoming a PLC means more scrutiny and required reporting. The company will have more shareholders and the value of the company could become more volatile as it is determined by the financial markets. \n\nPros\n\n* U.K. companies can raise more capital by being a PLC.\n* Becoming a PLC allows shareholders liquidity.\n* Increased ability to raise future capital and make acquisitions (by offering shares to target companies).\n\nCons\n\n* Increased scrutiny and regulation\n* Larger number of shareholders to be accountable to\n* Volatility in valuation increases as the company is beholden to financial markets.\n\n## Public Limited Company (PLC) vs. Private Limited Company (LTD)\n\nA PLC is a public company in the U.K. Meanwhile, there are private limited companies (LTDs), which are private companies in the U.K. Shares of a private limited company are not offered to the general public. \n\nPrivate companies are still incorporated, generally with the Companies House. These companies are still required to have legal documents to form the business. Private companies must have at least one director. \n\nTo raise capital via a public investment in the U.K. the company must be a PLC. PLCs are like LTDs, except they are publicly traded, with shares that can be freely sold and traded on a stock exchange. Meanwhile, PLCs must have at least two directors and hold annual shareholder meetings.\n\n## Examples of PLCs\n\nAll of the companies listed on the [London Stock Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lse.asp) are, by definition, PLCs. The fashion retailer Burberry is Burberry Group PLC. Automaker Rolls-Royce is Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC. The 100 largest PLCs on the London Stock Exchange are grouped together in an index called the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 (FTSE 100) or, colloquially, the Footsie.\n\nThe companies in this group are representative of the United Kingdom's economy as a whole. The Footsie is comparable to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the U.S. The biggest PLCs by market capitalization in the Footsie, as of March 2021, included Unilever, HSBC, and AstraZeneca.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell, HSBC Holdings, BP, GlaxoSmithKline, and British American Tobacco. The formal names of all of these companies include the PLC designation. Not all PLCs are listed on a stock exchange. A company may choose not to list on an exchange or may not meet the requirements for listing.\n\n## Public Limited Company (PLC) FAQs\n\n### What Does It Mean to Be a Public Limited Company (PLC)?\n\nA PLC is a publicly traded company in the U.K. These companies must have PLC or the words \"public limited company\" after its name. For example, the oil and gas company, BP plc, is a U.K. publicly traded company that's headquartered in London, England.\n\n### Who Is a Public Limited Company Owned By?\n\nLike publicly traded companies headquartered in the U.S., PLCs are owned by shareholders. These companies are traded on exchanges and shares where shares can be openly bought or sold by individuals, companies, mutual funds, etc.\n\n### What Are the Main Features of a PLC?\n\nThe key feature of a PLC is that it's based in the U.K. and be publicly traded. The company must also have the PLC or \"public limited company\" designation after its name.\n\n### What Is the Difference Between a Public and Private Limited Company?\n\nA PLC is a publicly traded company, while a private limited company is also a U.K. company, except it is private. There are other notable differences between the two, such as the fact that a private limited company only has to have one director, while a PLC must have two.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nA PLC is the equivalent of an Inc. or corp. company that trades in the U.S. PLCs are publicly traded companies in the U.K. Many famous U.K.-based companies are publicly traded and have the PLC designation after its name, such as consumer goods company Unilever plc and drugmaker AstraZeneca plc.", "timestamp": 1655172159, "digest": "qZbw3AFAcuZTyjRF4PxU3FKGgZZDla1vOOefypQzpoY", "contributor": "0xe6D4607eB0627096f2f1a32950d0f225B83083Fb"}
{"id": "9Zkl2rGsUp4NfIUBMCR5M8o3JZmXRLywxavobR7mHzU", "title": "Klinger Oscillator", "body": "## What Is the Klinger Oscillator?\n\nThe Klinger oscillator was developed by Stephen Klinger to determine the long-term trend of [money flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneyflow.asp) while remaining sensitive enough to detect short-term fluctuations. The indicator compares the [volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) flowing through securities with the security's price movements and then converts the result into an [oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oscillator.asp). The Klinger oscillator shows the difference between two moving averages which are based on more than price. Traders watch for [divergence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/divergence.asp) on the indicator to signal potential price reversals. Like other oscillators, a [signal line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signal_line.asp) can be added to provide additional trade signals.\n\nTraders will use tools such as [trendlines](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendline.asp), moving averages, and other indicators to confirm trade signals. In addition, traders may use the oscillator in conjunction with chart patterns, such as [price channels](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-channel.asp) or [triangles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triangle.asp), as a way to confirm a breakout or breakdown. Crossovers occur frequently, as do divergences, so the indicator is best used in conjunction with these other technical trading methods.\n\n## Formula for the Klinger Oscillator\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &KO = 34 \\\\text{ Period }EMA\\\\text{ of }VF - 55\\\\text{ Period EMA of }VF\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{KO} =\\\\text{ Klinger Oscillator}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{VF} =\\\\text{ Volume Force}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Volume Force }= V \\\\times \\[2 \\\\times ((dm/cm) - 1)\\] \\\\times T \\\\times 100\\\\\\\\ &V =\\\\text{ Volume}\\\\\\\\ &T =\\\\text{ Trend}\\\\\\\\ & \\\\text{Trend} =+1\\\\text{ if }(H + L + C) > (H_{-1} + L_{-1} + Cv_{-1})\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Trend} =-1 \\\\text{ if Above is }<\\\\text{ or }=\\\\\\\\ &H =\\\\text{ High}\\\\\\\\ &L =\\\\text{ Low}\\\\\\\\ &C =\\\\text{ Close}\\\\\\\\ &dm = H-L\\\\\\\\ &cm =cm_{-1} +dm\\\\text{ if Trend }=\\\\text{ Trend}_{-1}\\\\\\\\ &cm = dm_{-1} + dm\\\\text{ if Trend }=/= \\\\text{ Trend}_{-1} \\\\end{aligned}​*KO*=34 Period *EMA* of *VF*−55 Period EMA of *VF*where:KO= Klinger OscillatorVF= Volume ForceVolume Force =*V*×\\[2×((*dm*/*cm*)−1)\\]×*T*×100*V*= Volume*T*= TrendTrend=+1 if (*H*+*L*+*C*)>(*H*−1​+*L*−1​+*Cv*−1​)Trend=−1 if Above is < or =*H*= High*L*= Low*C*= Close*dm*=*H*−*Lcm*=*cm*−1​+*dm* if Trend = Trend−1​*cm*=*dm*−1​+*dm* if Trend =/= Trend−1​​﻿\n\n## Calculating the Klinger Oscillator\n\n* Note volume for the period, as well as the high, low and close prices.\n* Compare this to the prior period to determine if Trend is positive to negative.\n* Calculate dm using the current period's high and low.\n* Calculate cm using dm and the prior cm value. For the first calculation use dm in place of the prior cm value if necessary.\n* Calculate for volume force (VF).\n* Calculate the 34- and 55-period EMAs of VF.\n* Klinger used the following formula for the EMA:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &EMA = (C \\\\times A) + (E \\\\times B)\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &C=\\\\text{ Current period's VF}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\begin{aligned} A =\\\\ &2/(X+1)\\\\text{, where }X\\\\text{ is the moving average}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{ period (34 or 55)}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\\\\\ &E = \\\\text{Prior period's }EMA\\\\\\\\ &B=1-A \\\\end{aligned}​*EMA*=(*C*×*A*)+(*E*×*B*)where:*C*= Current period’s VF*A*= ​2/(*X*+1), where *X* is the moving average period (34 or 55)​*E*=Prior period’s *EMAB*=1−*A*​﻿\n\n## Interpretations for Price Direction\n\nThe Klinger Oscillator is fairly complex to calculate, but it's based on the idea of *force volume*, which accounts for volume, [trend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp) (positive or negative), and *temp* (based on multiple inputs and if/then statements). Using this data, the oscillator is created by looking at the difference between two [exponential moving averages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) of force volume involving different time frames (typically 34 and 55). The idea is to show how the volume flowing through the securities is impacting its long-term and short-term price direction.\n\n### The Signal Line\n\nA [signal line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signal_line.asp) (13-period moving average) is used to trigger buy or sell signals. This technique is very similar to signals that are created with other indicators such as the [moving average convergence divergence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) (MACD). While these are the basic signals generated by these indicators, it's important to note that these techniques may generate a lot of trading signals that may not be as effective in [sideways markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sidewaysmarket.asp).\n\n### The Uptrend\n\nWhen an asset is in an overall uptrend—such as when it is above its 100-period moving average and the Klinger is above zero or moving above zero—traders could buy when the Klinger oscillator moves above the signal line from below.\n\nKlinger noted that when a stock was in an uptrend, and then dropped to unusually low levels below zero, and then moved above its signal line, this was a favorable long position to take.\n\n### The Downtrend\n\nWhen an asset is in an overall downtrend, traders could sell or short-sell when the Klinger oscillator moves below the signal line from above. Klinger noted this was especially noteworthy when the indicator had seen an uncharacteristic spike above zero.\n\nThe zero line is also used by some traders to mark the transition from an uptrend to downtrend, or vice versa. While such signals won't always agree with price movements, a move above zero helps confirm a rising price, while a drop below zero helps confirm a falling price.\n\n### Klinger Oscillator and Divergence\n\nThe Klinger oscillator also uses divergence to identify when the indicator's inputs are not confirming the direction of the price move. It's a [bullish](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp) sign when the value of the indicator is heading upward while the price of the security continues to fall. It is a [bearish](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp) signal when the price is rising but the indicator is falling. Divergence can be coupled with signal line crossovers to generate trades. For example, if a bearish divergence forms, a sell or short-sell could be initiated the next time the Klinger crosses below the signal line.\n\n## Klinger Oscillator vs. On Balance Volume\n\nThe Klinger oscillator uses price and volume to create two EMAs. The indicator then shows the difference between these two EMAs. A signal line is then added to provide additional trade signals. [On balance volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp) is simpler in that it is a running total of positive or negative volume. Positive volume is added to the running total if the current close is above the prior close, or volume is subtracted from the running total if the current close is below the prior close.\n\n## Klinger Oscillator Limitations\n\nCrossovers and divergence, the two main functions of the oscillator, are prone to providing many [false signals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/false-signal.asp).\n\nSignal line crossovers are so frequent that it is hard to filter out which ones are worth trading and which ones aren't. Zero line crossovers also have issues, as the indicator may criss-cross the zero line multiple times before moving in a sustained direction, or the indicator may fail to move with the price resulting in a missed trading opportunity.\n\nDivergence can be useful, but often occurs too early, resulting in the trader missing a large chunk of the trend, or the divergence fails to result in a price reversal at all. Also, divergence is not present at all price reversals, so it is not a reliable tool for spotting all possible price reversals.\n\nUse the Klinger oscillator only in conjunction with other technical indicators or [price action](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp) analysis. \n \n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "hOT1FYU5QEhAlH_r6gQnU0oXuej3LHL5mBSMedfdQYA", "title": "不是Web2产品的替代，也不是Social to Earn：Web3社交的机会究竟在哪？", "body": "## 核心观点\n\n## 一、Web3社交概览\n\n### 1.1 相关概念：Web3社交、SocialFi、去中心化社交\n\n**Web3社交，可以说是所有具备与社交相关的Web3产品总称**，是一个很宽泛、但也比较容易理解的概念。就Web3而言，这些产品运行在公链上，在数据存储和运营管理上比Web2社交产品更强的去中心化特征，也往往会发行代币或者NFT；就“社交”而言，所有具备社交特征的场景都可以算在内，因此不少创作者经济相关的产品也在这个范畴内。值得注意的是，有些可能并不直接面向用户的协议类产品，一般也处于Web3的讨论范围。\n\nSocialFi，也许是近两年被提及比“Web3社交”更多的一个概念。从起源上来讲，SocialFi这个词的传播和DeFi、GameFi的火爆有关，它在一开始出现的时候，更多侧重于描述那些社交金融化特征明显、侧重代币机制设计的项目。**不过随着时间的推移，现在SocialFi一词也被泛化使用，广义上也可以指代几乎所有的Web3社交项目 —— 毕竟，Web3社交项目的用户数据、用户关系都沉淀在链上，再加上代币机制设计有更多的发挥空间，先天在金融化上面具备优势**。\n\n在更早的时候，也有过对“去中心化社交”“区块链社交”的讨论与尝试，不过随着“Web3社交”这一含义更全面的概念的出现，这些词汇也很少被人提及了。\n\n### 1.2 赛道发展现状：多次成为热点，但依然缺乏头部明星项目\n\n**Web3社交，整体来看，是一个依然处于萌芽期的赛道。相关项目层出不穷、星罗棋布，但直到2022年6月，这个赛道依然没有出现像Axie Infinity和StepN这样MAU最高超过百万的头部明星产品**。\n\n> 如果有读者感觉某社交项目的热度可能可以与Axie Infinity、StepN比较，可以通过对MAU的估计、GoogleTrends搜索热度等方式，做一些观察验证。笔者目前是没有找到这样的Web3社交项目。\n\n**然而，事实上每当加密货币市场出现牛市的时候，相关概念都会被人们提起和讨论一遍，也会涌现一些流行一时的热点项目**。但无论是上个周期的币乎、Steemit，还是这两年出现的Bitclout、Monaco，都只是昙花一现。这个事实，无疑非常值得深入探究其原因。\n\n**也正是因为Web3社交赛道缺少明星项目、多数处于发展早期或者概念期，再加上本身“社交”含义的宽泛，导致各种各样的项目星罗棋布**。因此，相对于做一些项目盘点、尝试对该赛道做系统性的梳理，本文将更加聚焦于对一些关键议题的讨论：场景、代币机制与产品形态。\n\n### 二、场景：Web3社交究竟能满足什么样的用户需求？\n\n### 2.1 Web2社交的问题 & Web2社交替代的可能性\n\nWeb3社交，起源于人们对Web2社交的不满。Web2社交产品所存在的弊病也经常被人们所讨论，这里归纳总结如下：\n\n1. 数据所有权问题：用户的数据、创作者的内容，被视为公司“数据资产、数据壁垒”的一部分；这是对用户本身权益的侵害，让用户面对公司的监管完全没有对抗能力。比如，微博、知乎、Twitter如果要封禁你的账号，你不仅会失去上面的创作内容和粉丝，更重要的是，很可能还申诉无门。这给用户带来了很大的不安全感。\n2. 数据隐私问题：数据全部储存在公司的中心化数据库里面，由公司员工管理；这存在数据泄露风险，各种用户数据贩卖的事情也早已不是新闻。\n3. 利益分配问题：创作者从用户这里得到的付费与打赏，平台方往往有一个较高的抽成比例；另外，平台主要依靠创作者内容流量变现的广告收入，但这些收入只有很少一部分流入了创作者。\n\n诚然，上述问题都是客观存在的。**但更关键的是，这些Web2弊病的改善都没有指向用户直接的产品体验：数据的所有权、隐私问题是用户所担心的，利益分配问题也是创作者所关注的，但如果用户进入一个项目的产品，发现功能不齐全甚至还不新颖、人数寥寥（早期社交产品难免是这样），那么它的留存依然会是很大的问题**。**事实上，用户参与一个社交场景的具体使用体验，Web3的产品并没有做出相对于Web2实现的产品革命性的改进，这导致“Web3”本身并不能为社交类产品至关重要的早期增长和网络效应积累进行赋能**。再考虑到Web3对于Web2用户还有一层认知和入门操作上的壁垒，它的初期用户仅局限于Web3的活跃用户，这给它的启动无疑又增加了难度。\n\n**从这个角度来看，简单的想在Web3世界里面做一个已有Web2成熟产品的场景，特别是如果这个产品已经被Web3用户所广泛使用，是非常难以成功的**。比如，在2021年上半年很火的，想做“Web3的Twitter”的Bitclout。毕竟，成熟社交产品具有极强的网络效应，不仅难以吸引新用户，而且即使吸引到了用户，一旦他们发现新的产品不能满足其现有的需求，那就会很快回到原来的成熟产品，再让他们回来将是难上加难。单靠Web3的新概念和对Web2现有问题的渲染宣传，最多只能成为吸引一部分Web3用户的引流手段，而不能成为产品走向成功的关键要素。事实上，所有做Web2已有产品替代、或者Web2已有场景的Web3社交项目，几乎无一例外都走向了失败。\n\n> 其实，上述的分析不仅适用于Web3社交，也几乎适用于所有具备强网络效应的Web3应用层的赛道。不少读者曾经可能都有过疑惑：为什么Web3也发展一段时间了，但在应用层依然处于非常早期的阶段，很少有非金融相关的热门应用类产品？希望笔者的分析能够为大家解惑。\n\n那么，既然已有Web2尝尽哪些场景可能存在Web3社交的机会呢？\n\n2\\.2 UGC社区场景 —— Web3差您\n\n按照关系链强弱和内容占比，社交场景可以分为：通信通讯类、交友匹配类、社交媒体、UGC社区类。四种场景的产品设计要点、交付给用户的价值是不一样的。\n\n对于\n\nSocialfi 中 fi 的概念可能是指：\n\n我们如何通过 token 的模型&方式，去重新做社交中的用户激励与利益分配？\n\n利益分配不止赚钱，例如 Dating APP 的匹配。\n\n至于 socialfi 里面的去中心化比重有多少，我认为可能没有办法做到全部环节的去中心化。\n\n比如说账号的新旧数据是用户自有的，无论是自己发的 UGC 内容还是新产生的社交图谱、关系链中的数据用户都可以自由处理与转移，这是去中心化的体现。但是最后很多环节可能避免不了要中心化，比如对于传统社交媒体和社交软件来说，它的一些核心能力与价值是掌握在平台当中的。\n\n比如对于dating app 来说核心是匹配算法，用户之间的匹配很难做到去中心化，因为会导致社交效率极低下。所以社交追求的是两件事，一个是找到的用户质量足够高，另一个是匹配精准用户的效率足够高。\n\n结合上面两点来看，我认为web3如果要将 social 和 fi 结合好，\\*\\*用户质量、用户获得感、用户参与感、用户对资产的拥有和处理，\\*\\*这些更偏质量的东西可能是优化的重点，而一些本身特别追求用户连接效率的社交模式不太适合做区块链的改造。\n\n即使是在Web2里面，想做一个新的社交产品，也要去寻找一个新的社交场景，这样才能与已有社交产品做出区分。Web3自然也不例外。这里笔者思考了以下两个方向，供大家参考：\n\n**2.1 DAO/社群的社区聊天群组工具（Discord的替代品）**\n\nWeb3用户现在常用的社交媒体有哪些？Twitter、Telegram、Discord三巨头。在这里面，Discord的存在就很特别：它原来是一个供游戏玩家交流的聊天群组，在Web2中的渗透率和知名度远不如Twitter和Telegram；但随着疫情的爆发和Web3的兴起，其使用人数得到激增，Web3的兴趣团体也纷纷建立群组。在往后，这似乎变成了一种习惯，Web3的项目们在“前辈”们的习惯和没有更好用、更普及工具的现实之下，也都纷纷选择Discord作为自己的社群管理与交流的平台工具。\n\n然而，这种普及并不代表着Discord本身就非常适用于Web3用户。Discord本身是一个典型的Web2产品，数据存储、管理审核都是中心化的；Discord的安全性事故频频发生，近期著名的时间有6月5日BAYC的Discord服务器就遭到攻击，导致价值200E的NFT被盗，其联合创始人Gordon Goner也发推文称“Discord不适用于Web3社區，我們需要一個更好的平台，将安全放在首位”。再者，Discord的产品体验，虽说已经做的不错，但针对Web3用户还是有不少改进空间的。\n\n从社区聊天群组工具这个具体场景来看，相比于Twitter的短讯息社交网络、Telegram的群组即时通讯，Discord的用户粘性、网络效应也更加弱。毕竟，用户在上面是没有好友关系或者关注关系沉淀，更多是“跟着项目方/社区核心人员走”。如果这些人愿意迁移到新的平台，那么大多数用户也会跟着迁移。因此，做一个Web3原生的社区聊天群组工具，替代Discord现有的生态位，个人认为还是有一定可行性的，在一级市场上也有一些早期的项目。\n\n**2.2 小而细分的新社交场景**\n\n既然在大的、成熟的场景做新的社交产品很难，那对于各种比较细分、没有很好既有Web2解决方案的新社交场景，Web3社交产品也可以做一些尝试。在这里面，如果这个场景本身就是Web3原生的，那自然再好不过；如果有Web2竞争对手，Web3社交产品就可以通过其特有的经济体系和对用户数据的尊重，在一开始的竞争中和Web2同类产品起到区分。\n\n例如Chiliz，主打体育产业里面的粉丝经济，$CHZ 是基于区块链的体娱粉丝激励平台 Socios 的原生通证。Socios目前与包括 AC 米兰、曼城、阿森纳、巴塞罗那、巴黎圣日耳曼和尤文图斯等 48 个俱乐部或伙伴合作发行粉丝代币。Socios.com 的用户通过持有Chiliz可购买俱乐部粉丝代币。而持有粉丝代币可拥有社区投票权、决策权等权益。在该社区中，拥有粉丝代币的球迷可以对俱乐部的球衣颜色、体育场音乐和徽标、友谊比赛、慈善阵容、入场歌曲等方面的事宜进行投票，且投票结果具有约束力、强化了用户的社区参与。\n\n$CHZ目前流通市值超过5亿美元，在CoinMarketCap中排名65，算是Web3社交赛道中当前发展的还算不错的项目。\n\n例如Showme，他是一个建立在Web3上的NFT社交订阅平台，聚焦于Web3相关内容的分享订阅，在大场景上与“知识星球”相仿。创作者可以通过灵活的订阅方式吸引和积累粉丝，以便用户进入俱乐部，包括免费、付费、持有 NFT 和 Token 订阅。Showme核心功能模块为订阅和 PONA（Proof of NFT Achievements，NFT 成就）。\n\n做Web3的“知识星球”，也是一个有可行性的方向，毕竟这也是一个网络效应相对较弱、用户跟着创作者走的场景，这个方向也可能会出现一些不错的项目，值得关注。\n\n**2.3 以NFT持有为门槛的高质量兴趣圈子**\n\n当下Web3还出现了一种社交性形式\n\n### 三、代币机制：社交场景不适合X2E；机制还有更多探索空间\n\n随着SocialFi概念的兴起，代币在社交产品中所能起到的作用也被大家所讨论。面对社交产品早期的增长难题，有些人会想，为什么不把DeFi和GameFi中的挖矿、“To Earn”玩法引到社交领域呢？毕竟Axie、包括后来的StepN都是依靠这个方法破圈的。因此，我们也看到了不少主打“Social to Earn”“Create to Earn”，或者说是“社交挖矿”“内容挖矿”的项目。\n\n然而，这些项目无一例外都走向了没落。究其原因，是因为社交场景并不适合作为“X to Earn”中的“X”场景：一方面，社交场景的评价体系依赖于其他用户的反馈，导致初期激励有限、反作弊机制设计也较为困难，容易导致经济体系不平衡；另一方面，即使起步成功，大量涌入的以“打金”为目的的用户也会损害社交产品本身的调性，一旦“to Earn”这部分收益锐减就会带来大量用户的流逝。Steemit、Monaco从喧嚣到落寞的过程，都佐证了这一点。（关于X to Earn场景的讨论，可以参考笔者之前写的文章：）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ijh64w0KBCP607237TKxR.png?height=1868&width=3496)\n\n那么，如果不考虑X to Earn，社交代币又有什么具体的用户呢？如上图所示，知名Web3研究机构Messari曾将社交代币分为三类：个人代币、社区代币、平台代币。然而，具体来看的话，我们可以发现这些价值依然是一些比较经典的Web3代币价值类型，比如Pass、治理权、分红权、潜在升值空间等。\n\n我们可以看到，这些代币价值依然是一些比较经典的Web3代币价值。虽然它们确实能够在项目发展中起到一定积极作用，但就社交场景中特有的用户激励与利益分配而言，依然有很多的探索空间。目前，就Web3社区中对各种创新类的代币机制、经济模型的研究来看，相比于Defi、Gamefi，Web3社交赛道确实缺乏让人眼前一亮的代币机制设计，期待之后的项目能够给大家带来更多的惊喜。\n\n### 四、产品形态：协议与应用之争\n\n“胖协议，瘦应用”这一Web3理念，一直存在相关的争议与讨论，这在社交赛道中体现的尤为明显。下面让我们来具体看看关于应用层产品形态的问题。\n\n4\\.1 Web3协议简介\n\n什么是Web3社交中的“协议”呢？打个最直观的比方，就是手机通讯录：当你下载一个新的App的时候，一部分App会允许你“导入通讯录”，从而自动的在好友名单上获取通讯录中其它使用该App的好友；腾讯系App的“导入微信好友”也是相似的道理。它们某种程度上，都试图在把人们的社交关系给“协议化”，让一个希望引入社交相关功能的新产品，能够快速获取用户的社交关系并让用户上手，而不是再重新走一遍让用户加好友这一费时费力的行为。\n\n遗憾的是，在Web2中，随着手机号作为社交象征的式微、各大平台的派系划分，上述功能的体验并不尽如人意。而在Web3中，由于Web3基于区块链的技术架构，协议层天然有着更好的发展空间 —— 既然一个“合格”Web3社交应用中，与用户相关的数据、关系都会沉淀在链上，那为什么不先把这部分提取出来做成一个协议，方便各种新的想做社交功能的应用产品来调用呢？\n\n因此，“胖协议，瘦应用”这一理念，在社交赛道指的是这样的畅想：用户之间的社交关系、互动数据，都被协议们所提取、沉淀下来；而任何一个新的应用想要做社交功能的话，就可以调用这些协议，让用户能够“无缝继承”之前已有的社交历史。也就是说，用户可以毫无顾忌地退出一个平台或加入一个新的平台，而不用担心自己的朋友、粉丝、内容、价值无法带走。\n\n目前而言，Web3协议层比较受关注的两大项目是CyberConnect和Lens Protocol，其Twitter粉丝数都超过了5万。它们在具体的技术实现机制上区别不小：Cyberconnect本身不是智能合约，内容储存在IPFS上，其对开发者和用户学习成本较高，但是没有Gas费用、内容也永久储存；Lens Protocol本质是基于Polygon的智能合约，希望构建以NFT为核心的社交关系图谱，它的可组合型更好、门槛更低，但是有Gas消耗和Layer2容量、url化的NFT内容储存问题。\n\n除了CyberConnect和Lens Protocal以外，另外两个有一定关注度的社交协议是5Degrees和Mem Protocol，感兴趣的读者可以再做进一步研究。\n\n4\\.2 应用与协议之争\n\n从意识形态上来讲，“胖协议，瘦应用”肯定更加符合Web3社区去中心化、去平台化的理念。毕竟，谁都不希望每换一个应用都要重新整一遍加好友和关注 —— 如果真的是这样与Web2无异的体验，那也就失去Web3的意义了。\n\n然而，从实际发展上来讲，协议本身又很难脱离应用而走向用户：这一点和DID有点类似，如果没有切身、实际的需求，愿意事先给自己打造一套身份、构建一套社交关系的用户，终归是少数。也就是说，社交协议想要真的成型，往往还需要有面向用户、有具体社交场景的产品的火爆来把它带火。\n\n那么，鉴于协议层本身的价值和想象力，这个已经火起来的社交产品，为什么不自己把协议层也做了呢？毕竟不少协议代码是开源的，而它们目前沉淀的关系网络并没有太多价值。其实，协议项目方本身也意识到了这个问题，比如Lens Protocol也有往应用产品发展的趋势。应用会往协议走、协议会往应用走，这方面的竞争态势才刚刚展开，远没有达到成熟。甚至，就连本应属于Web3上游的DID，也遭到了波及 —— 有些社交项目在展望中，提到了构建DID的展望，而一些DID项目也不排除自己做Social场景的可能。\n\n总而言之，虽然协议和应用在成熟的Web3中会是一个分离较为明显的事情，但在Web3发展的初期，它们的耦合可能会是相当严重的，竞争关系也是错综复杂的。笔者的个人认为，在初期如果出现火爆的社交产品，更考验团队对用户需求的理解能力、运营能力，这方面做应用产品起家的团队可能会更有优势；但长期来看，Web3社交中协议层的打造是一个必然的趋势，在这方面一些做协议出身的、有技术积累的团队可能会更有优势。\n\n五、总结与个人观点",

This predetermined price at which the buyer of the put option can sell the underlying security is called the [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp).\n\nPut options are traded on various underlying assets, including stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities, futures, and indexes. A put option can be contrasted with a [call option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), which gives the holder the right to buy the underlying security at a specified price, either on or before the expiration date of the option contract.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Put options give holders of the option the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying security at a specified price within a specified time frame.\n* Put options are available on a wide range of assets, including stocks, indexes, commodities, and currencies.\n* Put option prices are impacted by changes in the price of the underlying asset, the option strike price, time decay, interest rates, and volatility.\n* Put options increase in value as the underlying asset falls in price, as volatility of the underlying asset price increases, and as interest rates decline.\n* Put options lose value as the underlying asset increases in price, as volatility of the underlying asset price decreases, as interest rates rise, and as the time to expiration nears.\n\n0 seconds of 5 minutes, 26 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n5:26\n\n#### Put Option Basics\n\n## How a Put Option Works\n\nA put option becomes more valuable as the price of the underlying stock or security decreases. Conversely, a put option loses its value as the price of the underlying stock increases. As a result, they are typically used for hedging purposes or to speculate on downside price action.\n\nInvestors often use put options in a risk management strategy known as a [protective put](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protective-put.asp), which is used as a form of investment insurance or hedge to ensure that losses in the underlying asset do not exceed a certain amount. In this strategy, the investor buys a put option to hedge downside risk in a stock held in the portfolio. If and when the option is exercised, the investor would sell the stock at the put’s strike price. If the investor does not hold the underlying stock and exercises a put option, this would create a short position in the stock.\n\n### Factors That Affect a Put’s Price\n\nIn general, the value of a put option decreases as its time to expiration approaches because of the impact of time decay. Time decay accelerates as an option’s time to expiration draws closer since there’s less time to realize a profit from the trade. When an option loses its time value, the [intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp) is left over. An option’s intrinsic value is equivalent to the difference between the strike price and the underlying stock price. If an option has intrinsic value, it is referred to as [in the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp) (ITM).\n\nOption Intrinsic Value = Difference between Market Price of Underlying Security and Option Strike Price (For Put Option, IV = Strike Price *minus* Market Price of Underlying Security; for Call Option, IV = Market Price of Underlying Security *minus* Strike Price)\n\n[Out of the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) (OTM) and [at the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) (ATM) put options have no intrinsic value because there is no benefit in exercising the option. Investors have the option of short-selling the stock at the current higher market price, rather than exercising an out-of-the-money put option at an undesirable strike price. However, outside of a [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp), short selling is typically [riskier than buying put options](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp).\n\nTime value, or extrinsic value, is reflected in the [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp) of the option. If the strike price of a put option is $20, and the underlying is stock is currently trading at $19, there is $1 of intrinsic value in the option. But the put option may trade for $1.35. The extra $0.35 is time value, since the underlying stock price could change before the option expires. Different put options on the same underlying asset may be combined to form [put spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021814/what-bull-put-spread.asp).\n\nThere are several factors to keep in mind when it comes to selling put options. It’s important to understand an option contract’s value and profitability when considering a trade, or else you risk the stock falling past the point of profitability.\n\nThe payoff of a put option at expiration is depicted in the image below:\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020\n\nWhat if you had started investing years ago?\n\nFind out what a hypothetical investment would be worth today.\n\nSELECT A STOCK\n\nTSLA\n\nTESLA INC\n\nAAPL\n\nAPPLE INC\n\nNKE\n\nNIKE INC\n\nAMZN\n\nAMAZON.COM, INC\n\nWMT\n\nWALMART INC\n\nSELECT INVESTMENT AMOUNT\n\n$\n\nSELECT A PURCHASE DATE\n\n              2 years ago                      5 years ago                      10 years ago         \n\nCALCULATE\n\n## Where to Trade Options\n\nPut options, as well as many other types of options, are traded through brokerages. Some brokers have specialized features and benefits for options traders. For those who have an interest in options trading, there are many [brokers that specialize in options trading](https://www.investopedia.com/best-brokers-for-options-trading-4587876). It’s important to identify a broker that is a good match for your investment needs.\n\n## Alternatives to Exercising a Put Option\n\nThe buyer of a put option does not need to hold an option until expiration. As the underlying stock price moves, the premium of the option will change to reflect the recent underlying price movements. The option buyer can sell their option and either minimize loss or realize a profit, depending on how the price of the option has changed since they bought it.\n\nSimilarly, the option writer can do the same thing. If the underlying price is above the strike price, they may do nothing. This is because the option may expire at no value, and this allows them to keep the whole premium. But if the underlying price is approaching or dropping below the strike price, then to avoid a big loss, the option writer may simply buy the option back (which gets them out of the position). The profit or loss is the difference between the premium collected and the premium paid to get out of the position.\n\n## Example of a Put Option\n\nAssume an investor buys one put option on the [SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)](https://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/spy/quote_table), which was trading at $445 (January 2022), with a strike price of $425 expiring in one month. For this option, they paid a premium of $2.80, or $280 ($2.80 × 100 shares or units).\n\nIf units of SPY fall to $415 prior to expiration, the $425 put will be “in the money” and will trade at a minimum of $10, which is the put option’s intrinsic value (i.e., $425 - $415). The exact price for the put would depend on a number of factors, the most important of which is the time remaining to expiration. Assume that the $425 put is trading at $10.50.\n\nSince the put option is now “in the money,” the investor has to decide whether to (a) exercise the option, which would confer the right to sell 100 shares of SPY at the strike price of $425; or (b) sell the put option and pocket the profit. We consider two cases: (i) the investor already holds 100 units of SPY; and (ii) the investor does not hold any SPY units. (The calculations below ignore commission costs, to keep things simple).\n\nLet’s say the investor [exercises](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/putoptionexcercise.asp) the put option. If the investor already holds 100 units of SPY (assume they were purchased at $400) in their portfolio and the put was bought to hedge downside risk (i.e., it was a protective put), then the investor’s broker would sell the 100 SPY shares at the strike price of $425.\n\nThe net profit on this trade can be calculated as:\n\n\\[(SPY Sell Price - SPY Purchase Price) - (Put Purchase Price)\\] × Number of shares or units\n\nProfit = \\[($425 - $400) - $2.80)\\] × 100 = $2,220\n\nWhat if the investor did not own the SPY units, and the put option was purchased purely as a speculative trade? In this case, exercising the put option would result in a short sale of 100 SPY units at the $425 strike price. The investor could then buy back the 100 SPY units at the current market price of $415 to close out the short position.\n\nThe net profit on this trade can be calculated as:\n\n\\[(SPY Short Sell Price - SPY Purchase Price) - (Put Purchase Price)\\] × Number of shares or units\n\nProfit = \\[($425 - $415) - $2.80)\\] × 100 = $720\n\nExercising the option, (short) selling the shares and then buying them back sounds like a fairly complicated endeavor, not to mention added costs in the form of commissions (since there are multiple transactions) and margin interest (for the short sale). But the investor actually has an easier “option” (for lack of a better word): Simply sell the put option at its current price and make a tidy profit. The profit calculation in this case is:\n\n\\[Put Sell Price - Put Purchase Price\\] × Number of shares or units = \\[10.50 - $2.80\\] × 100 = $770\n\nThere’s a key point to note here. Selling the option, rather than going through the relatively convoluted process of option exercise, actually results in a profit of $770, which is $50 more than the $720 made by exercising the option. Why the difference? Because selling the option enables the time value of $0.50 per share ($0.50 × 100 shares = $50) to be captured as well. Thus, most long option positions that have value prior to expiration are sold rather than exercised.\n\nFor a put option buyer, the maximum loss on the option position is limited to the premium paid for the put. The maximum gain on the option position would occur if the underlying stock price fell to zero. \n \n\n### SELLING VS. EXERCISING AN OPTION\n\nThe majority of long option positions that have value prior to expiration are closed out by [selling rather than exercising](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/09/when-exercise-options.asp), since exercising an option will result in loss of time value, higher transaction costs, and additional margin requirements.\n\n## Writing Put Options\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed put options from the perspective of the buyer, or an investor who has a long put position. We now turn our attention to the other side of the option trade: the put option seller or the put option writer, who has a short put position.\n\nContrary to a long put option, a short or written put option obligates an investor to take delivery, or purchase shares, of the underlying stock at the strike price specified in the option contract.\n\nAssume an investor is bullish on SPY, which is currently trading at $445, and does not believe it will fall below $430 over the next month. The investor could collect a premium of $3.45 per share (× 100 shares, or $345) by writing one put option on SPY with a strike price of $430.\n\nIf SPY stays above the $430 strike price over the next month, the investor would keep the premium collected ($345) since the options would expire out of the money and be worthless. This is the maximum profit on the trade: $345, or the premium collected.\n\nConversely, if SPY moves below $430 before option expiration in one month, the investor is on the hook for purchasing 100 shares at $430, even if SPY falls to $400, or $350, or even lower. No matter how far the stock falls, the put option writer is liable for purchasing the shares at the strike price of $430, meaning they face a theoretical risk of $430 per share, or $43,000 per contract ($430 × 100 shares) if the underlying stock falls to zero.\n\nFor a put writer, the maximum gain is limited to the premium collected, while the maximum loss would occur if the underlying stock price fell to zero. The gain/loss profiles for the put buyer and put writer are thus diametrically opposite.\n\n## Is Buying a Put Similar to Short Selling?\n\nBuying puts and short selling are both bearish strategies, but there are some important differences between the two. A put buyer’s maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the put, while buying puts does not require a margin account and can be done with limited amounts of capital. Short selling, on the other hand, has theoretically unlimited risk and is significantly more expensive because of costs such as stock borrowing charges and margin interest (short selling generally needs a margin account). Short selling is therefore considered to be much riskier than buying puts.\n\n## Should I Buy In the Money (ITM) or Out of the Money (OTM) Puts?\n\nIt really depends on factors such as your trading objective, risk appetite, amount of capital, etc. The dollar outlay for in the money (ITM) puts is higher than for out of the money (OTM) puts because they give you the right to sell the underlying security at a higher price. But the lower price for OTM puts is offset by the fact that they also have a lower probability of being profitable by expiration. If you don’t want to spend too much for protective puts and are willing to accept the risk of a modest decline in your portfolio, then OTM puts might be the way to go.\n\n## Can I Lose the Entire Amount of the Premium Paid for My Put Option?\n\nYes, you can lose the entire amount of premium paid for your put, if the price of the underlying security does not trade below the strike price by option expiry.\n\n## I’m New to Options and Have Limited Capital; Should I Consider Writing Puts?\n\nPut writing is an advanced option strategy meant for experienced traders and investors; strategies such as writing cash-secured puts also need a significant amount of capital. If you’re new to options and have limited capital, put writing would be a risky endeavor and not a recommended one.", "timestamp": 1655172323, "digest": "jwurH86wijPf0Tb5gN0JwMZ663Ekeg3peK9oHHlNivA", "contributor": "0x1581b3922b26288C90Ddaa53d0EF4485CC76A62a"}

The OASDI tax noted on your paycheck funds this comprehensive federal benefits program that [provides benefits to retired adults](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/121015/how-social-security-works-after-retirement.asp) and people with disabilities—and to their spouses, children, and survivors. The goal of the program is to partially replace income that is lost due to old age, death of a spouse, or qualifying ex-spouse, or disability.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The federal OASDI program is the official name for Social Security.\n* It provides benefits to retired adults and people with disabilities.\n* OASDI taxes, also known as FICA payroll taxes, fund the program.\n* The amount of an individual’s monthly payment is based on their earnings during their working years.\n\n## Understanding the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program\n\nThe U.S. Social Security program is the largest such system in the world and is also the biggest expenditure in the federal budget, projected to cost $1.2 trillion in 2021.1 Nearly nine out of 10 individuals age 65 and older receive [Social Security benefits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-benefits.asp), according to the [Social Security Administration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssa.asp) (SSA).2 Social Security calculates your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) during the 35 years in which you earned the most.3\n\nThe program was ushered in through the [Social Security Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-act.asp), signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14, 1935, when the U.S. economy was in the depths of the [Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp).4 The program has grown massively over the decades, along with the U.S. population and economy. In 1940, about 222,000 people received an average monthly benefit of $22.60.5 As of October 2021, that number was nearly 70 million.6 For 2021, the average monthly benefit is $1,543 (the estimated average monthly benefit in 2022 is $1,657).78\n\n## OASDI Payroll Tax\n\nPayments to qualifying persons are funded through OASDI taxes, which are [payroll taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payrolltax.asp) collected by the government that are known as FICA taxes (short for [Federal Insurance Contributions Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fica.asp)) and SECA taxes (short for [Self-Employed Contributions Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seca.asp)). In 2021 and 2022, the Social Security tax rate is 6.2% for employees and 12.4% for the self-employed.87\n\nThese revenues are kept in two trust funds:\n\n* The [Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (ASI) Trust Fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/old-age-and-survivors-insurance-trust-fund.asp) for retirement\n* The [Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disability-insurance-trust-fund.asp) for disability9\n\nThese trust funds pay out the benefits and invest the remainder of the revenue they collect.\n\nThere is a cap on annual earnings for which you pay Social Security tax. In 2022, the maximum earnings subject to the tax is $147,000.8 In 2021, the maximum earnings subject to the tax is $142,800.7\n\n## OASDI Program Criteria\n\nThe OASDI program provides payments to people who meet certain criteria. For old-age payments, money is paid to qualifying persons starting as early as age 62. [Full retirement age](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normal-retirement-age-nra.asp) depends on birth date and is 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.10 Qualifying persons who wait until age 70 (but no later) to begin collecting benefits can collect higher, maximum benefits due to delayed retirement credits.11\n\nPayments are calculated based upon people's wages earned while they were of working age. Survivors' payments are made to surviving spouses or [eligible children](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/031716/social-security-benefits-children-how-they-work.asp) of deceased workers or retired workers.12 Disability payments are made to eligible persons who are no longer able to participate in a substantially gainful activity and who meet additional criteria.13\n\nTo qualify for retirement benefits, a worker must be fully insured. A worker can become fully insured by accumulating credits (also called quarters) of coverage. Credits or quarters are accumulated based on covered wages earned for a particular period. In 2021, one-quarter of coverage is awarded to a worker for every $1,470 earned. The dollar amount is indexed every few years for inflation. A worker can earn up to four credits or quarters of coverage per year, and 40 credits are needed to qualify for benefits.", "timestamp": 1655172389, "digest": "FtQqISOG-i5ByFS5ZzENTqvs3hVks8V8NI6Kvb825Us", "contributor": "0x77FBcf23A7FdC38d8B949509578a1bA01431a672"}

Our ability to curate talented artists into Web3 is reflected in the value of our unique social token, $PV1, which gives every member of Team Phlote an economic stake in its growth.\n\nTo facilitate the growth of our community, we've built a music TCR as a merit based community onboarding tool. created an open submission process that allows any music fan with an internet connection and a crypto wallet to earn $PV1 tokens for curating music on Phlote.xyz.\n\nWe're opening the door for people with a keen eye for talent to distinguish themselves as leading curatorial voices in Web3.\n\nHow do people get these tokens?\n\nEach day, our community members scan the music submissions on Phlote.xyz and co-sign the songs they like. Curators who receive co-signs, earn $PV1 tokens and earn the right to have a profile on Phlote.xyz to start building their track record.\n\nThis effort ensures Team Phlote controls how the community grows and helps guarantee that our path towards a truly community-owned platform - where curators are the owners and operators of the network - is in line with the open, transparent, and permission-less ethos of blockchain technology.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. $PV1 isn’t available for purchase and can only be earned through submission at Phlote.xyz.\n2. $PV1 will be distributed to anyone who submits music at Phlote.xyz and receives co-signs from current members of the community.\n3. Curators earn 15 $PV1 for each co-sign received.\n4. Curators earn higher status within the community as they earn more $PV1 tokens. 1 co-sign earns the right to have a unique profile on Phlote. Curators who earn 20 co-signs (300 $PV1) earn the right to become co-signers.\n5. The game will last until the total supply of 1,000,000 $PV1 tokens has been fully distributed to members of the community.\n\nThe Goal?\n\n1. To surface up-and-coming voices at the cross section of music and technology.\n2. To introduce the world's most talented, independent artists to the blockchain.\n3. To build Team Phlote into an elite community of artists and curators who will create the world's leading music discovery platform.\n\n4/27/22\n\nOur #1 Priority: A custom auction house that sells NFT editions at Vickrey Auction. All NFT editions are sold in rounds with preference given to DAO contributors. Phlote to test auction mechanics with NFT sale that decentralizes marketplace on Day 1.\n\n4/25/22\n\nThe full potential for Web3 are products that are 100% built, operated, and owned by the community around them. Platforms that are open for anyone to join, have a clear mission, and a value orientation. These platforms will be structured as user owned companies or DAOs.\n\nIn the music industry, many artists must fight to be heard. Music discovery is not designed to showcase the many talented vocalists, musicians, producers, songwriters who exist in the world, but should.\n\nWe propose a system that centers artists, curators, and collectors as the backbone of the music industry. One that incentivizes the discovery of new music, makes it easily sharable, and help artists to identify their core fans. This alternative path that allows great music to be heard and doesn’t require artists to sign away their creative rights or ownership to labels.\n\nThe opportunity allows a new set of internet users to participate. Now anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can earn tokens for phloting great music to Web3.\n\n4/20/22\n\nSome believe that music discovery is alive and well in the hands of streaming platforms like Spotify.  We disagree.\n\n1. Today music discovery is not happening for independent artists on streaming platforms. Sixty thousand songs are uploaded daily. Only major label supported artists get seen. The system is broken.\n2. Algorithms are an inferior way to spur word of mouth spread for indie artists. Human recommendations reign supreme in music discovery.\n3. The True Fans looking to find new music are coming to Web3 for the ability to discover new artists and buy in early via NFTs. Adding crypto may prove difficult for incumbent music platforms to implement.\n4. Users will begin to migrate to platforms that they help build, use, and co-own as a community. Spotify is not likely to revolutionize a business model that has been profitable for the executive team and shareholders.\n\nPhlote is designed to solve these issues for artists, curators, and True Fans.\n\n4/19/22\n\n## The Future of Online Curation\n\nFew people are just browsing the internet. Most are actively searching for things. Every day, Google processes 5.6 billion searches for 5 billion global internet users. The search results we see first are those that are ad supported, relegating the best information “below the fold”. In this scenario, Google and its advertisers win, while users are underserved by search 5.6 billion times per day. Sadly, we’ve grown accustomed to this just being the way it is.\n\nThe number of daily internet searches shows that the internet is an active space for discovery. We’re all looking to discover new ideas, new technology, new art, new music. So why would we tolerate an internet that makes it more difficult to find the best ideas and best information? We shouldn’t.\n\nOne reason why online communities became popular is because they allowed people to meet others like themselves and learn from one another. From blogs to chat rooms to threads, communities have always been where curated conversations have taken place, serving as the best source of information.\n\nOutside of online forums, internet curation is present, but not widely recognized for the value it brings to our online experience. Internet tastemakers are the source of cool internet shit and important instigators of ideas spreading by word of mouth. Depending on how close you are to the source determines how early you are to emerging internet culture, and culture in general.  That said, the value generated by curators is not matched by the compensation they receive for their time. Using music as the example, a large community of internet curators spend hours digging for new music only to receive benefits that are mostly intrinsic and derive from one's ability to say they found it first. What’s needed is a way for this work to be compensated commensurate with the value generated for creators and consumers.\n\nWith blockchain technology, this is now possible.\n\n4/15/22\n\n* Metrics\n  * #submissions\n  * #cosigns received/given\n  * volume of phlote tokens moved\n  * submissions/sale\n  * commissions\n  * reviews/listen\n  * submitter reviews/comments\n  * Value of NFTs sold\n  * OBP -

Post curation the listener should ideally be buying NFT's and creating their own playlists.\n  * What is the full depth of our TCR Token mechanics?\n    * Token value is driven by token demand for archive/index inclusion.\n    * Music submissions require tokens.\n    * Curation requires tokens.\n    * As more tokens are purchased/burned through the submission process, value accrues to Phlote Token Holders.\n    * A quality index creates demand to be included in the index, which translates into earnings for curators.\n      * Curators drive value for artists by taking the selling burden off of them.\n      * Should reviews be emotionally driven (how the art made the curator feel)\n        * That commentary could be more valuable than a simple rating and as valuable as providing the historical/cultural context for works.\n  * Dashboard could be used to show number of submissions, percentage reviewed, tokens staked, token inventory, archive.  Maybe we create a music inbox - goal is to get to inbox 0.\n  * Is there a feed?\n  * Are there recommendation engines that advertisers use that could be reframed to present users helpful information based on preferences?\n  * What should we take away from bitclout for our token economics and functionality? Betting on artists early before they even get on the platform - buying value in that artist.\n  * Idea - artists can mint a song as a rare 1 of 1 NFT that can be kept private or added to a public playlist\n    * This makes a whole new economy around rare tracks the artist can release outside of albums.\n    * Artists can put rare 1 of 1 songs on a playlist that is “pay to stream”\n  * If we're encouraging collection/playlisting, then rarity of songs will be a big driver of value and an important part of the ownership experience.  If we assume all curators are DJs that are using the TCR to source music for their sets, then we should absolutely figure out a way for them to be able to monetize their lists and share proceeds with the artists.\n  * One way is to let DJ's play sets and list/link to NFT's that are included in the set.\n  * NFTs owned will also be a part of everyone's profile.\n* **Appendix NOTES: July 31**\n  * Make the experience fun → gamified experience\n  * randomized rewards → builds hype → randomly get 10k\n\n2/17/22\n\nGuests; Saeed Bolden, Singh Cap Partners\n\n2/16/22\n\n* Operating Agreement signed\n* Social media branding updated\n* Guests: Odenz, Yana Sosnovskaya\n\n2/15/22\n\n* TCR Rollout\n  * Email activation + podcast/newsletter\n* Released First Episode of “Curator Call”\n* Polygon Intro\n* Guests: Stefanie Thomas, Sean Wilkes\n\n2/14/22\n\n* Guests: Harrison, Glue, Heno, Carter Brown, Odenz\n\n2/13/22\n\n* Rest Day\n\n2/12/22\n\n* Phlote Search Tokenomics\n  * Curation\n    * Curators buy NFT's and receive PV tokens to participate --> Establishes Eth/PV ratio\n    * Curators mint curation NFTs --> Higher ETH/PV\n    * Curators only gain \"exposure\" to treasury from having submissions staked (co-signed) by other curators.\n    * Unstaked tokens are burned at the end of the period.\n  * Artists\n    * Artists pay to sbmit songs --> Higher ETH/PV\n  * Rankings\n    * Curators ranked by tokens staked (points) and by number of co-signs received\n    * Payouts happen automatically at the end of each epoch.\n* Micro Algorithmic Curation Hedge Funds\n  * Track Record established and tracked.\n  * We curate the Highest Returns.\n  * Consider establishing a 1 week lag on curated versus externally shared content\n  * To start, keep search open and updated it in real time.\n    * Create an index of such quality that artists are compelled to submit.\n    * Maintain Free Search so that the information is always free.\n    * Having a permissionless minting platform underpin our submission process like Mint Split will allow Phlote to personally direct artists to our minting platform to support Phlote tokens and create custom smart contracts that have the following provisions banked in:\n      * social impact royalty\n      * curator credits\n      * automatic inclusion in Phlote Index\n      * Phlote economics - 80/15/5\n* Ranking\n  * Rankings are calculated per period based on points accrued from each curators curation and co-signing activity.\n  * The curator has three token balances\n    * Tokens purchased\n    * Tokens staked\n    * Tokens received\n  * Only tokens staked and received count towards rankings to encourage sharing and co-signing great content that others will enjoy :-)\n    * Some curators may not be compelled by game or social mechanics, preferring to prioritize  the opportunity to archive culture on chain as reward enough.\n  * Token staking rewards.\n    * (Point Multiple/Cost)\n    * Curator (+ 6x PV1)/$.5\n    * First cosigner (+ 5x PV1)/$.25\n    * Second cosigner (+ 4x PV1)/$.25\n    * Third cosigner (+ 3x  PV1)/$.25\n    * Fourth cosigner (+ 2x PV1)/$.25\n    * Firth cosigner (+ 1x PV1)/$.25\n  * PV1 - Phlote Vote 1 Tokens\n  * Those who stake tokens early have highest potential for to accrue points.\n  * Curators who mint submissions are only players who have potential for immediate financial benefit.\n* Rankings and Rewards\n  * Programmatic Rewards:\n    * Phlote Treasury is the reward pool.\n      * Top 3 winners get payouts as below.\n      * All participants have exposure to art portfolio through PV1 holdings.\n    * Continue 1 million token epochs.\n      * Liquid treasury assets (submission fees and curation NFT mint fees) earned over the period get paid out to top 3 curators as follows.\n        * 1st Place - 40%\n        * 2nd Place - 30%\n        * 3rd Place - 20%\n        * Phlote 10% + Yield (fee for Phlote platforms/partner curation)\n* Re-up\n  * At the end of each period, a set of new NFTs is minted and Vickery auctioned to restart the game.\n  * Participants in the current round have a chance to retain membership seat.\n* Revenue opportunities:\n  * This is a curation game that allows members to identify the highest quality digital assets.

We realized early on that our community has great taste. The first artist we identified, Billy Racxx, is now prolific across Web3. Jansport J is now a 2x Grammy nominated artist. Rocky Snyda and JayProb have been unleashed to take over NYC.  We believe in the power of our curation so much,that we’ve started to buy NFTs of the artists our community has introduced us to.\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/lukebars/reflections-ft-dupes->\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/jansportj/grimm>\n  * <https://beta.catalog.works/theodoregrams/bad-jawn>\n* Recently, we brought live voting for songs to Twitter spaces. The results have been just as impressive as before, with the added benefits of live programming. We invite you to come join us every Tuesday at 7 pm. Each week’s winner gets minted on Catalog. We pay the gas fee and buy the NFT. We now plan to scale our efforts by opening the opportunity for anyone to participate as we curate and purchase NFT of artists emerging in Web3.\n* As curators, we want to tag the content we fw. Any writer will tell you that the most important thing your tag can carry is respect. Otherwise, there is no value.\n* Collectors of $Tags will have the opportunity to help us decide which artists to #stamp and have incentive to do so. Funds raised through this crowdfund will be directed to the Phlote Treasury, where they will be used to purchase NFTs of the artists we collectively decide to support through our Live Vote Show. Any holder of $Tags will also own shares of Phlote Treasury, giving them financial exposure to the value of the underlying NFTs.\n* 50% of the tokens generated from this Crowdfund will be retained by Phlote to compensate hosts and reward curators.\n* https://zora.co/collections/zora/4341\n* Guests: Silkey, $Grams\n\n2/1/22\n\n* Live Vote Show Winner - [Twerl](https://twitter.com/twerlbeats/status/1488665872763785217?s=20&t=UWXCwlGJ-IIQA_mkjNAB5g)\n* L1 vs L2 Recording -→ [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d75qagaeq3pfzex/L1%3AL2.m4a?dl=0)\n* FUTRxLGND Live Vote Show January 8th OS NYC\n* Calls: Sheed, Merna Maker (Seed Club), Russ Ballard (40 Acres DAO)\n\n1/31/22\n\n* [Partner Meeting](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtlllwlcsscdjo5/Partner%20Call%20%281.31.22%29.mp4?dl=0)\n* Scheduling Season 1 of a Podcast Series we’re calling “Curator Call”\n  * 8 - 12 week season\n  * February 15 Release\n* Calls: Bob Fisk (Seed Club)\n\n1/30/22\n\n* Calls: Rome Fortune\n\n1/29/22\n\n* Phlote TCR\n  * Design Curator Cards - 5150/KB\n  * Co-signs are comments/stamps.\n    * Stamps rev goes to original curator.\n    * Mint fees goes to Phlote DAO to support token.\n* Phlote OS Apps\n  * Read, Watch, Listen (Blog/Syllabus, Office, Secret)\n  * Three roles - artist, curator, collector\n  * Add role select to the website that highlights different apps - unlocked by specific tokens\n  * Edit and send videos to ArifHallway Genesis Mints\n* Finish Newsletter\n  * Add Roadmap\n  * Topic Fully Transparent Business Model + Community\n* Letters - Curator Club, Broad Email List\n  * Curator Club - Partners + SC/Mirror Support + At Large\n* Phlote Partner Call added to Google Calendar\n* Explore minting a snapshot the business once weekly.\n  * Cohorts, stats, etc.\n  * Link with Lia C. on data visualization\n  * Weekly Cohorts (Indexed as ETF’s)\n* Reach out to top 55 artists to mint on mint split.\n  * Phlote pays gas\n* (1+1) = ♾\n\n1/28/22\n\n* Phlote OS\n  * Close out block color\n  * Edit and send videos to Arif\n  * Wallpaper rendering\n  * Airtable link\n  * “Artist name” + flashlight in search bar\n  * Circle Blinker\n  * Dante - Let’s start to test contracts\n  * Look for Jitsi to mint integration\n  * Is Private Vickrey Auction possible on Mirror\n  * Saba - Marketplace designs for Mint Split\n  * Artist Index Page\n* Phote TCR\n  * How do we track and show wallet addresses captured?

Knock-ins are a type of [barrier option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrieroption.asp) that are classified as either a [down-and-in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daio.asp) or an [up-and-in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/up-and-inoption.asp). A barrier option is a type of contract in which the payoff depends on the [underlying security's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp) price and whether it hits a certain price within a specified period.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A knock-in option is a type of barrier option which is triggered only after the underlying asset's price reaches a certain specified barrier.\n* There are two types of knock-in options: down-and-in and up-and-in. In the former, the option is triggered only if the underlying asset's price falls below a certain level. The latter type of option is triggered only after an underlying asset's price rises to a certain level.\n\n## Understanding Knock-In Options\n\nKnock-in options are one of the two main types of barrier options, with the other type being [knock-out options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knock-outoption.asp).\n\nA knock-in option is a type of contract that is not an option until a certain price is met. So if the price is never reached, it is as if the contract never existed. However, if the underlying asset reaches a specified barrier, the knock-in option comes into existence. The difference between a knock-in and knock-out option is that a knock-in option comes into existence only when the underlying security reaches a barrier, while a knock-out option ceases to exist when the underlying security reaches a barrier.\n\nBarrier options typically have cheaper [premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp) than traditional [vanilla options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vanillaoption.asp), primarily because the barrier increases the chances of the option expiring worthless. A trader may choose the cheaper (relative to a comparable vanilla) barrier option if they feel it is quite likely the underlying will hit the barrier.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020 \n\n## Down-and-In Knock-In Option\n\nAssume an investor purchases a down-and-in [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) with a barrier price of $90 and a [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) of $100. The underlying security is trading at $110, and the option [expires](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp) in three months. If the price of the underlying security reaches $90, the option comes into existence and becomes a vanilla option with a strike price of $100. Thereafter, the holder of the option has the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price of $100, even though it is trading below $90. It is this right that gives the option value.\n\nThe put option remains active until the expiration date, even if the underlying security rebounds back above $90. However, if the underlying asset does not fall below the barrier price during the life of the contract, the down-and-in option expires worthless. Just because the barrier is reached does not assure a profit on the trade since the underlying would need to stay below $100 (after triggering the barrier) in order for the option to have value.\n\n## Up-and-In Knock-In Option\n\nContrary to a down-and-in option, an up-and-in option comes into existence only if the underlying reaches a barrier price that is above the current underlying's price. For example, assume a trader purchases a one-month up-and-in [call option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on an underlying asset when it is trading at $40 per share. The up-and-in call option contract has a strike price of $50 and a barrier of $55. If the underlying asset does not reach $55 during the life of the option contract, it expires worthless. However, if the underlying asset rises to $55 or above, the call option would come into existence and the trader would be [in the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp).\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

A knock-out option sets a cap on the level an option can reach in the holder's favor.\n\nAs knock-out options limit the profit potential for the option buyer, they can be purchased for a smaller [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-premium.asp) than an equivalent option without a knock-out stipulation.\n\nA knock-out can be compared with a [knock-in option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knock-inoption.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Knock-out options are a type of barrier option, which expire worthless if the underlying asset's price exceeds or falls below a specified price.\n* The two types of knock-out options are up-and-out barrier options and down-and-out options.\n* Knock-out options limit losses, but also potential profits.\n\n## Understanding a Knock-Out Option\n\nA knock-out option is a type of [barrier option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrieroption.asp). Barrier options are typically classified as either knock-out or knock-in. A knock-out option ceases to exist if the underlying asset reaches a predetermined barrier during its life. A knock-in option is effectively the opposite of the knock-out. Here, the option is activated only if the underlying asset reaches a predetermined barrier price.\n\nKnock-out options are considered to be [exotic options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exoticoption.asp), and they are primarily used in commodity and currency markets by large institutions. They also may be traded in the [over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) market.\n\n## Types of Knock-Out Options\n\nKnock-out options come in two basic types:\n\n### Down-and-Out Option\n\nA [down-and-out option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daoo.asp) is one variety. It gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell an [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp) at a predetermined strike price—if the underlying asset's price does not go *below* a specified barrier during the option's life. Should the underlying asset's price fall below the barrier at any point in the option's life, the option expires worthless.\n\nFor example, assume an investor purchases a down-and-out [call option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on a stock that is trading at $60, with a [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) of $55 and a barrier of $50. If the stock trades below $50, at any time, before the call option expires then the down-and-out call option promptly ceases to exist. \n\n### Up-and-Out Option\n\nContrary to a down-and-out barrier option, an [up-and-out barrier option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/up-and-outoption.asp) gives the holder the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified strike price if the asset has not *exceeded* a specified barrier during the option's life. An up-and-out option is only knocked out if the price of the underlying asset moves above the barrier.\n\nAssume an investor purchases an up-and-out [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) on a stock trading at $40, with a strike price of $30 and a barrier of $45. Over the life of the option, the stock hits a high of $46 but then drops to $20 per share. Too bad: the option still would automatically expire because the barrier of $45 had been breached. Now, if the stock hadn't gone above $45 and eventually sold off to $20, then the option would remain in place and have value to the holder.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Knock-Out Options\n\nA knock-out option may be used for several different reasons. As mentioned, the premiums on these options are typically cheaper than a non-knock-out counterpart. A trader may also feel that the odds of the underlying asset hitting the barrier price is remote and conclude that the cheaper option is worth the risk of unlikely being knocked out of the trade. \n\nFinally, these types of options may also be beneficial to institutions that are only interested in [hedging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) up or down to very specific prices or have very narrow [tolerances for risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp).\n\nPros\n\n* Have lower premiums\n* Limit losses\n* Good for specific hedge/risk-management strategies\n\nCons\n\n* Vulnerable in volatile markets\n* Limit profits\n* Exotic options often less accessible to investors\n\nKnock-out options limit losses. However, as is often the case, buffers on the [downside](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downside.asp) also limit profits on the upside. Moreover, the knock-out feature is triggered even if the designated level is breached only briefly. That can prove dangerous in [volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) markets.\n\n## Knock-Out Option Example\n\nLet's say an investor is interested in Levi Strauss & Co., which went [public](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) on March 21, 2019, at $17 a share.1 By May 2, it closed at $22.92 per share.2 Say our investor is bullish on the historic jeans maker, but still cautious.\n\nThe investor may write a call option at $23 per share with a strike price of $33 and a knock-out level of $43.

{"id": "dCzjj_1O36bGXg1HOu1zmgrrnXEXHi5crsYYUpMNjik", "title": "Know Sure Thing (KST)", "body": "## What Is the Know Sure Thing (KST)?\n\nThe Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum [oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oscillator.asp) developed by Martin Pring to make rate-of-change readings easier for traders to interpret.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator intended to interpret rate-of-change price data.\n* Trading signals are generated when the KST crosses over the signal line, but traders also look for overbought or oversold conditions.\n* Traders also combine the KST with other technical analysis to maximize their odds of a successful trade.\n\n## Calculating the Know Sure Thing (KST)\n\nThe KST is calculated by taking the [simple moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp) (SMA) of four different [rate-of-change](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofchange.asp) (ROC) periods, adding them together to come up with the KST, and creating a signal line by taking the 9-period SMA of the KST.\n\nThe KST is calculated with the following equation:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{KST} = ( \\\\text{RCMA \\\\#1} \\\\times 1 ) + ( \\\\text{RCMA \\\\#2} \\\\times 2 ) \\\\ + \\\\\\\\ &\\\\phantom { \\\\text{KST} = } (\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#3} \\\\times 3 ) + ( \\\\text{RCMA \\\\#4} \\\\times 4) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#1} = \\\\text{10-period SMA of 10-period ROC} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#2} = \\\\text{10-period SMA of 15-period ROC} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#3} = \\\\text{10-period SMA of 20-period ROC} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#4} = \\\\text{15-period SMA of 30-period ROC} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​KST=(RCMA #1×1)+(RCMA #2×2) +KST=(RCMA #3×3)+(RCMA #4×4)where:RCMA #1=10-period SMA of 10-period ROCRCMA #2=10-period SMA of 15-period ROCRCMA #3=10-period SMA of 20-period ROCRCMA #4=15-period SMA of 30-period ROC​\n\nFinally, the [signal line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signal_line.asp) is calculated by taking the 9-period SMA of the KST value.\n\n## Understanding the Know Sure Thing (KST)\n\nThe KST indicator can be used in the same manner as many other momentum oscillators, such as the well-known [relative strength index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) (RSI). Trading signals are generated when the KST crosses over the signal line, but traders may also look for convergence and divergence with the price, overbought or oversold conditions, or [crossovers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossover.asp) of the center line.\n\nMany traders combine the KST indicator with other forms of technical analysis to maximize their odds of success. For example, traders may look at other non-momentum indicators, chart patterns, or [candlestick](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) patterns to help in their decision-making.\n\n### \n\n*In a 1992 Stocks and Commodities article, Pring referred to the indicator as \"Summed Rate of Change (KST),\" but the KST term stuck with [technical analysts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analyst.asp).1*\n\n## Example of the Know Sure Thing (KST)\n\nLet's take a look at an example chart:\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2021\n\nIn the example above, the KST indicator reached highly overbought conditions in early February and eventually experienced a crossover, which generated a well-timed [sell signal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sell-signal.asp). The indicator also crossed over in late February, mid-March, and mid-April with limited success, but the key is looking for both [overbought](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overbought.asp) or [oversold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversold.asp) conditions, as well as a crossover to signal the trade.\n\nTraders may have also looked at other forms of [technical analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) to maximize their odds of a successful trade. For example, traders looking at the above chart may have considered the significant bearish [volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) on the day that the signal occurred or the candlestick patterns leading up to the trading signal when making their decision. These insights could also be used to avoid making less profitable trades suggested by the KST indicator.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "g4kCHv9J_9PoWIi9d9C5QQBZvFqIhK_rO_EKz83IC8E", "title": "Know Your Client (KYC)", "body": "## What Is Know Your Client (KYC)?\n\nThe Know Your Client or Know Your Customer is a standard in the investment industry that ensures investment advisors know detailed information about their clients' [risk tolerance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp), investment knowledge, and financial position. KYC protects both clients and investment advisors. Clients are protected by having their investment advisor know what investments best suit their personal situations. Investment advisors are protected by knowing what they can and cannot include in their client's portfolio. KYC compliance typically involves requirements and policies such as risk management, customer acceptance policies, and transaction monitoring.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Know Your Customer (KYC) are a set of standards used within the investment and financial services industry to verify customers, their risk profiles, and financial profile.\n* In the investment industry, KYC stipulates that every broker-dealer should use reasonable effort regarding client accounts.\n* The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established minimum KYC requirements, including verifying beneficial owners and setting standards for dealing with third parties.\n* The SEC requires that a new customer provide detailed financial information before opening an account.\n* The cryptocurrency market is not required to employ KYC standards, although some have.\n\n## Understanding Know Your Client (KYC)\n\nThe Know Your Client (KYC) rule is an ethical requirement for those in the securities industry who are dealing with customers during the opening and maintaining of accounts. There are two rules which were implemented in July 2012 that cover this topic together: [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp) (FINRA) Rule 2090 (Know Your Customer) and FINRA Rule 2111 (Suitability). These rules are in place to protect both the broker-dealer and the customer and so that brokers and firms deal fairly with clients.\n\nThe Know Your Customer Rule 2090 essentially states that every broker-dealer should use reasonable effort when opening and maintaining client accounts. It is a requirement to know and keep records on the essential facts of each customer, as well as identify each person who has authority to act on the customer’s behalf.\n\nThe KYC rule is important at the beginning of a customer-broker relationship to establish the essential facts of each customer before any recommendations are made. The essential facts are those required to service the customer’s account effectively and to be aware of any special handling instructions for the account. Also, the [broker-dealer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp) needs to be familiar with each person who has the authority to act on behalf of the customer and needs to comply with all the laws, regulations, and rules of the securities industry.\n\n## Suitability Rule\n\nAs found in the FINRA Rules of Fair Practices, Rule 2111 goes in tandem with the KYC rule and covers the topic of making recommendations. The suitability Rule 2111 notes that a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds when making a recommendation that is suitable for a customer based on the client’s financial situation and needs. This responsibility means that the broker-dealer has done a complete review of the current facts and profile of the customer, including the customer’s other securities before making any purchase, sale, or exchange of a security.\n\n## Requirements for KYC Compliance\n\nThe U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has set baseline requirements for KYC in conjunction with the core requirements for the due diligence program. To prevent money laundering, financial institutions are required to conduct deeper assessments of their clients' risk profiles.\n\nFinCEN requires that financial institutions verify the identities of their customers and their respective beneficial owners⁠—owners with at least 25% ownership⁠.1 For entities with a high anti-money laundering and terrorism finance (AML) risk, additional scrutiny is required and the threshold for ownership is lowered.\n\nFinCEN requires financial institutions to understand the type and purpose of the customer relationship when developing the customer risk profile. This risk profile is created when the customer relationship is established and is used as a baseline for detecting suspicious activities.\n\nWhen using third parties to collect and verify customer profiles, financial institutions must verify that the third party employs specific risk controls and has an appropriate governance structure. To remain in compliance, they must secure AML and customer identification program (CIP) certificates from a third party each year.\n\nLastly, financial institutions must also maintain current and accurate customer information and continue to monitor their accounts for suspicious and illegal activities.2 When detected, they are required to promptly report their findings.\n\n## Establishing a Customer Profile\n\nInvestment advisors and firms are responsible for knowing each customer's financial situation by exploring and gathering the client's age, other investments, tax status, financial needs, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance. The SEC requires that a new customer provide detailed financial information that includes name, date of birth, address, employment status, annual income, net worth, investment objectives, and identification numbers before opening an account.\n\n## KYC and Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is wildly praised for being decentralized and a medium of exchange that promotes confidentiality; however, these benefits also present challenges in preventing money laundering. Criminals see cryptocurrency as a means of furthering their illegal activities and as a vehicle to launder money; as a result, governing bodies are looking for ways to impose KYC on cryptocurrency markets, requiring cryptocurrency platforms to [verify their customers](https://www.investopedia.com/news/why-new-know-your-customer-project-crucial-blockchain/) much like financial institutions. Although not yet required, many platforms have implemented KYC practices.\n\nExchanges are classified as either crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto.3 Because crypto-to-crypto exchanges don't deal with traditional currency, they do not have the same pressures to employ KYC standards as with exchanges that deal with fiat currencies.\n\nFiat-to-crypto exchanges facilitate transactions involving fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Since fiat currency is the official currency of a nation, most of these exchanges employ some measure of KYC. Fortunately, financial institutions should have already vetted their customers according to KYC requirements.\n\n### $60 million\n\n*The penalty assessed against Bitcoin mixer Larry Dean Harmon for violating anti-money laundering laws.4*﻿\n\nIn early 2021, FinCEN proposed that cryptocurrency and digital asset market participants submit, maintain, and verify customers' identities. 5﻿ This proposal would classify certain cryptocurrencies as monetary instruments, subjecting them to KYC requirements.\n\n## KYC FAQs\n\n### What Is KYC Verification?\n\nThe Know Your Client or Know Your Customer (KYC) verification are a set of standards and requirements used in the investment and financial services industries to ensure they have sufficient information about their clients, their risk profiles, and financial position.\n\n### What Is KYC in the Banking Sector?\n\nKYC in the banking sector involves bankers and advisors identifying their customers, beneficial owners of businesses, and the nature and purpose of customer relationships, as well as reviewing customer accounts for suspicious and illegal activity. Banks must also maintain and ensure the accuracy of customer accounts.\n\n### What Are KYC Documents?\n\nRequirements differ in different jurisdictions. However, account owners generally must provide a government-issued ID as proof of identity. Some institutions require two forms of ID, such as a driver's license, birth certificate, social security card, or passport. In addition to confirming identity, the address must be confirmed. This can be done with proof of ID or with an accompanying document confirming the address of the record.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) are a set of standards and requirements investment and financial services companies use to verify the identity of their customers and any associated risks with the customer relationship. KYC also ensures investment advisors know detailed information about their clients' risk tolerance and financial position. The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) prescribed rules financial institutions must follow when verifying the identity of customers and their beneficial owners, if any. They must verify the circumstances around the customer relationship, as well as monitor and report any suspicious or illegal activity.

{"id": "kbgW_LR0fDsw9_Gq6YrcI8qEff-Mh5dQk1OVei7a648", "title": "Oligopoly", "body": "## What Is an Oligopoly?\n\nAn oligopoly is a market structure with a small number of firms, none of which can keep the others from having significant influence. The concentration ratio measures the market share of the largest firms.\n\nA [monopoly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp) is a market with only one producer, a [duopoly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duopoly.asp) has [two firms](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121514/what-are-major-differences-between-monopoly-and-oligopoly.asp), and an oligopoly consists of two or more firms. There is no precise upper limit to the number of firms in an oligopoly, but the number must be low enough that the actions of one firm significantly influence the others.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The term \"oligopoly\" refers to a small number of producers working, either explicitly or tacitly, to restrict output and/or fix prices, in order to achieve above normal market returns.\n* Economic, legal, and technological factors can contribute to the formation and maintenance, or dissolution, of oligopolies.\n* The major difficulty that oligopolies face is the prisoner's dilemma that each member faces, which encourages each member to cheat.\n* Government policy can discourage or encourage oligopolistic behavior, and firms in mixed economies often seek government blessing for ways to limit competition.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 27 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:27\n\n#### Oligopoly\n\n## Understanding Oligopolies\n\nOligopolies in history include steel manufacturers, oil companies, railroads, tire manufacturing, grocery store chains, and wireless carriers. The economic and legal concern is that an oligopoly can block new entrants, slow innovation, and increase prices, all of which harm consumers.\n\nFirms in an oligopoly [set prices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricemaker.asp), whether collectively—in a [cartel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cartel.asp)—or under the leadership of one firm, rather than [taking prices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetaker.asp) from the market. Profit margins are thus higher than they would be in a more competitive market. \n\n## Conditions That Enable Oligopolies\n\nThe conditions that enable oligopolies to exist include high entry costs in [capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp), legal privilege (license to use wireless spectrum or land for railroads), and a platform that gains value with more customers (such as social media).\n\nThe global tech and trade transformation has changed some of these conditions: offshore production and the rise of \"mini-mills\" have affected the steel industry, for example. In the office software application space, Microsoft was targeted by Google Docs, which Google funded using cash from its web search business.\n\n## Why Are Oligopolies Stable?\n\nAn interesting question is why such a group is stable. The firms need to see the benefits of collaboration over the costs of economic competition, then agree to not compete and instead agree on the benefits of co-operation. The firms have sometimes found creative ways to avoid the appearance of [price-fixing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixing.asp), such as using phases of the moon. Price-fixing is the act of setting prices, rather than letting them be determined by the free-market forces. Another approach is for firms to follow a recognized [price leader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-leadership.asp); when the leader raises prices, [the others will follow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/follow-the-leader-pricing.asp).\n\n## The Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nThe main problem that these firms face is that each firm has an incentive to cheat; if all firms in the oligopoly agree to jointly restrict supply and keep prices high, then each firm stands to capture substantial business from the others by breaking the agreement undercutting the others. Such competition can be waged through prices, or through simply the individual company expanding its own output brought to market. \n\nGame theorists have developed models for these scenarios, which form a sort of [prisoner's dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp). When costs and benefits are balanced so that no firm wants to break from the group, it is considered the [Nash equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nash-equilibrium.asp) state for oligopolies. This can be achieved by contractual or market conditions, legal restrictions, or strategic relationships between members of the oligopoly that enable the punishment of cheaters.\n\nCompanies in an oligopoly benefit from price-fixing, setting prices collectively, or under the direction of one firm in the bunch, rather than relying on free-market forces to do so.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nIt is interesting to note that both the problem of maintaining an oligopoly and the problem of coordinating action among buyers and sellers in general on the market involve shaping the payoffs to various prisoner's dilemmas and related coordination games that repeat over time. As a result, many of the same institutional factors that facilitate the development of market economies by reducing prisoner's dilemma problems among market participants, such as secure enforcement of contracts, cultural conditions of high trust and reciprocity, and laissez-faire economic policy, might also potentially help encourage and sustain oligopolies.\n\nGovernments sometimes respond to oligopolies with laws against price-fixing and collusion. Yet, a cartel can price fix if they operate beyond the reach or with the blessing of governments. [OPEC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opec.asp) is one example of this since it is a cartel of oil-producing states with no overarching authority. Alternatively, in mixed economies, oligopolies often seek out and lobby for favorable government policy to operate under the regulation or even direct supervision of government agencies.\n\n## What Are Some Negative Effects of an Oligopoly?\n\nAn oligopoly is when a few companies exert significant control over a given market. Together, these companies may control prices by colluding with each other, ultimately providing uncompetitive prices in the market. Among other detrimental effects of an oligopoly include limiting new entrants in the market and decreased innovation. Oligopolies have been found in the oil industry, railroad companies, wireless carriers, and big tech.\n\n## What Is an Example of a Current Oligopoly?\n\nOne measure that shows if an oligopoly is present is the concentration ratio, which calculates the size of companies in comparison to their industry. Instances where a high concentration ratio is present include mass media. In the U.S., for example, the sector is dominated by just five companies: NBC Universal; Walt Disney; Time Warner; Viacom CBS; and News Corporation—even as streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime begin to encroach on this market. Meanwhile, within big tech, two companies control smartphone operating systems: Google Android and Apple iOS.\n\n## Is the U.S. Airline Industry an Oligopoly?\n\nWith just four companies controlling nearly two-thirds of all domestic flights in the U.S. as of 2021, it has been purported that the airline industry is an oligopoly. These four companies are Delta Airlines, United Airlines Holdings, Southwest Airlines, and American Airlines. According to a report compiled by the White House, \"reduced competition contributes to increasing fees like baggage and cancellation fees. These fees are often raised in lockstep, demonstrating a lack of meaningful competitive pressure, and are often hidden from consumers at the point of purchase.\"1 Interestingly, in 1978, The Airline Deregulation Act was imposed, which stripped away the Civil Aeronautics Board the ability to regulate the industry.2 Prior to this time, the airline industry operated much like a public utility, while fare prices had declined 20 years before the deregulation was introduced. ", "timestamp": 1655172492, "digest": "qLKsgCR4fPXSLs6B2eRcrpS0ole3lK4OuPJ-7E_6-I0", "contributor": "0xa731614453FD77C62cca4BD9aF59D92710A0cbB7"}

{"id": "wm3q2mBcMiR3Fvw1hyI0tAqlNjyZNkwBCIX6koyr3-k", "title": "Onerous Contract", "body": "## What Is an Onerous Contract?\n\nAn onerous contract is an accounting term that refers to a contract that will cost a company more to fulfill than what the company will receive in return.\n\nThe term is used in many countries worldwide, where international regulators have determined that such contracts must be accounted for on balance sheets. The United States has a different system, based on [generally accepted accounting principles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp), or GAAP, as set forth by the U.S.-based Financial Accounting Standards Board.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* An onerous contract is an accounting term defined under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), used in many countries around the world.\n* Companies that follow those standards are required to report any onerous contracts they're committed to on their balance sheets.\n* In the United States, companies typically follow a different set of accounting standards and generally don't have to account for their onerous contracts.\n\n## Understanding Onerous Contracts\n\nThe International Accounting Standards (IAS) defines an onerous contract as \"a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\"1﻿\n\nThe term \"unavoidable costs\" also has a specific meaning for accounting purposes. The IAS defines it as \"the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill it.\"1﻿\n\n## Onerous Contract Example\n\nAn example of an onerous contract might be an agreement to rent a property that is no longer needed or that can no longer be made use of profitably. For instance, suppose a company signs a multiyear agreement to rent office space, then moves or downsizes while the agreement is still in effect, leaving the office space, which it now has no use for, vacant. Or consider a mining company that has signed a lease to mine for coal or some other commodity on a piece of land, but at some point during the term of the contract, the price of that commodity falls to a level that makes extracting it and bringing it to market unprofitable.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nThe rules for how onerous contracts should be treated in a company's financial statements are part of the [International Financial Reporting Standards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ifrs.asp) (IFRS), for which the IAS Board is the independent standard-setting body. The governing body, the IFRS Foundation, is a not-for-profit organization based in London.2﻿\n\nInternational Accounting Standard 37 (IAS 37), \"Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets,\" classifies onerous contracts as \"provisions,\" meaning liabilities or debts that will accrue at an uncertain time or in an unknown amount. Provisions are measured using the best estimate of the expenses required to satisfy the current obligation.3﻿\n\nUnder IAS 37, any business or company that identifies a contract as onerous is required to recognize the current obligation as a liability and to list that liability on its balance sheet. This process is meant to be undertaken at the first indication that the company expects a loss from the contract.1\n\n﻿\n\nThe IFRS and IASB standards are used by companies in many countries throughout the world, although not in the United States. The U.S. requires companies to follow another set of standards under GAAP. Under GAAP, losses, obligations, and debts on committed onerous contracts typically are not recognized or dealt with. However, the FASB has been working with the IASB to establish compatible standards worldwide.", "timestamp": 1655172568, "digest": "bxXCguOgf-3h9KkTWcRURf3nCqIdlnz8PTmdIEPCT2c", "contributor": "0x7b98FEDE91018f32Ae2B65f659F1e4D0C24E532f"}
{"id": "LiHnkZrIrjCLZKL44vk-Er-cYGyG0E0yKBr22p9t1Cw", "title": "Online Banking", "body": "## What Is Online Banking?\n\nOnline banking allows a user to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.\n\nOnline banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of [online banking](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/11/benefits-and-drawbacks-of-internet-banks.asp), available both on desktop versions and through mobile apps.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Online banking allows a user to conduct financial transactions via the Internet.\n* Consumers aren't required to visit a bank branch in order to complete most of their basic banking transactions.\n* A customer needs a device, an Internet connection, and a bank card to register. Once registered, the consumer sets up a password to begin using the service.\n\n## Understanding Online Banking\n\nWith online banking, consumers aren't required to visit a bank branch to complete most of their basic banking transactions. They can do all of this at their own convenience, wherever they want—at home, at work, or on the go.\n\nOnline banking requires a computer or other device, an Internet connection, and a bank or [debit card](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/050214/credit-vs-debit-cards-which-better.asp). In order to access the service, clients need to register for their bank's online banking service. In order to register, they need to create a password. Once that's done, they can use the service to do all their banking.\n\nBanking transactions offered online vary by the institution. Most banks generally offer basic services such as transfers and bill payments. Some banks also allow customers to open up new accounts and apply for credit cards through online banking portals. Other functions may include ordering checks, putting stop payments on checks, or reporting a change of address.\n\nChecks can now be deposited online through a mobile app. The customer simply enters the amount before taking a photo of the front and back of the check to complete the deposit.\n\nOnline banking does not permit the purchase of traveler's checks, bank drafts, certain wire transfers, or the completion of certain credit applications like mortgages. These transactions still need to take place face-to-face with a bank representative.\n\n### \n\n*Most banks do not charge fees for online banking.*\n\n## Advantages of Online Banking\n\nConvenience is a major advantage of online banking. Basic banking transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds between accounts can easily be done 24 hours a day, seven days a week, wherever a consumer wishes.\n\nOnline banking is fast and efficient. Funds can be transferred between accounts almost instantly, especially if the two accounts are held at the same institution. Consumers can open and close a number of different accounts online, from fixed deposits to recurring deposit accounts that typically offer higher rates of interest.\n\nConsumers can also monitor their accounts regularly closely, allowing them to keep their accounts safe. Around-the-clock access to banking information provides early detection of fraudulent activity, thereby acting as a guardrail against financial damage or loss.\n\n## Disadvantages of Online Banking\n\nFor a novice online banking customer, using systems for the first time may present challenges that prevent transactions from being processed, which is why some consumers prefer face-to-face transactions with a teller.\n\nOnline banking doesn't help if a customer needs access to large amounts of cash. While he may be able to take a certain amount at the ATM—most cards come with a limit—he will still have to visit a branch to get the rest.\n\nAlthough online banking security is continually improving, such accounts are still vulnerable when it comes to hacking. Consumers are advised to use their own data plans, rather than public Wi-Fi networks when using online banking, to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nAdditionally, online banking is dependent on a reliable Internet connection. Connectivity issues from time to time may make it difficult to determine if banking transactions have been successfully processed.\n\n## Online Banks\n\nSome banks operate exclusively online, with no physical branch. These banks handle customer service by phone, email, or online chat. Online banking is frequently performed on mobile devices now that Wi-Fi and 5G networks are widely available. It can also be done on a desktop computer.\n\nThese banks may not provide direct [automatic teller machine](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atm.asp) (ATM) access but will make provisions for consumers to use ATMs at other banks and retail stores. They may reimburse consumers for some of the ATM fees charged by other [financial institutions](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/what-are-major-categories-financial-institutions-and-what-are-their-primary-roles.asp). Reduced overhead costs associated with not having physical branches typically allow online banks to offer consumers significant savings on banking fees. They also offer higher interest rates on accounts.\n\nProminent online banks in the United States include Ally Bank,1 Bank5 Connect,2 Discover Bank,3 and Synchrony Bank.", "timestamp": 1655172629, "digest": "iXnYHUOrROSlxiRmpLRZd1VukvhuLWptGs5elx4-f4Y", "contributor": "0xf4633bcF878DE9986C64f8DcF96313D6A5525D08"}

This knowledge can be commodified in the form of [patents](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patent.asp) or other [intellectual property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp) protections. The producers of such information, such as scientific experts and research labs, are also considered part of the knowledge economy. \n \n\nThe Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was a major turning point in the treatment of intellectual property in the U.S. because it allowed universities to retain title to inventions or discoveries made with federal R&D funding and to negotiate exclusive licenses.1\n\nThanks to globalization, the world economy has become more knowledge-based, bringing with it the best practices from each country's economy. Also, knowledge-based factors create an interconnected and global economy where human expertise and trade secrets are considered important economic resources.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that [generally accepted accounting principles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) (GAAP) do not allow companies to include these assets on their balance sheets.\n\n### \n\n*The modern commercialization of academic research and basic science has its roots in governments seeking military advantage.*\n\n## Knowledge Economy and Human Capital\n\nThe knowledge economy addresses how education and knowledge—that is, \"[human capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humancapital.asp)\"— can serve as a productive asset or business product to be sold and exported to yield profits for individuals, businesses, and the economy.\n\nThis component of the economy relies greatly on intellectual capabilities instead of natural resources or physical contributions. In the knowledge economy, products, and services that are based on intellectual expertise advance technical and scientific fields, encouraging innovation in the economy as a whole.\n\nThe World Bank defines knowledge economies according to four pillars:\n\n1. Institutional structures that provide incentives for entrepreneurship and the use of knowledge\n2. Availability of skilled labor and a good education system\n3. Access to information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures\n4. A vibrant innovation landscape that includes academia, the private sector, and civil society.2\n\n## Example of a Knowledge Economy\n\nAcademic institutions, companies engaging in [research and development](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp) (R&D), programmers developing new software and search engines for data, and health workers using digital data to improve treatments are all components of a knowledge economy.\n\nThese economy brokers pass on the results of their research to workers in more traditional fields, such as farmers who use software applications and digital solutions to manage their crops better, advanced technological-based medical procedures such as robot-assistant surgeries, or schools that provide digital study aids and online courses for students.\n\n## How Big Is the Knowledge Economy?\n\nBecause it is not a clearly-defined category such as manufacturing, it is difficult to put an exact price tag on the global knowledge economy. However, it is possible to gain a rough estimate by gauging some of the major components of the knowledge economy. In the United States, the total intellectual property market is worth $6.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and IP-intensive industries account for over a third of GDP. The market size of the country's higher education institutions accounts for an additional $568 billion.34\n\n## What Are the Most Valuable Skills in the Knowledge Economy?\n\nWhile higher education and technical training are obvious assets, communication and teamwork are also essential skills for a knowledge-based economy, according to the [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oecd.asp). Since it is unlikely that any single knowledge worker can generate groundbreaking innovations alone, these interpersonal and workplace competencies are essential to surviving in a knowledge-based workplace.5\n\n## Which Country Has the Biggest Knowledge Economy?\n\nThe factors of a knowledge economy are measured by the United Nations Development Program's Global Knowledge Index, which replaced the World Bank Knowledge Economy Index after 2012. This metric scores each country based on \"enabling factors\" for the knowledge economy, such as education levels, technical and vocational training, innovation, and communications technology. According to the latest issue, Switzerland is the top-ranked knowledge economy with a total score of 71.5%. The next two are Sweden and the United States with scores of 70.0 each.6\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvIsPkBsuaEGxH43SdO_TkioixQyWnu6S-BIgLZIcFeHwmAYDVuNIMd9YqTuAQozhI2ZxhOMBUwD9DDpVnGc7rzq72b8acLNPU3StOCi2rMK2iWX7PXrBo8fuvjedi-HDhaAURrVZnSi9f_5OAkrDik3BAJqKY-QwWV_u51-OTfoRbL5AaYzCUv8QwEIoidkrJllC487joCcjf6QzkwVvSWh4dk9NDBHQAJSqCBEVVaG8GwlMwlVhJmKdigmloXXzME8pG8cRLUqIP2mzgqIiq8N_CRc1J49PtKt6AD01yu85cHDyspE2bc_yuDW9fOx2sVEi8jWMahlA&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKN-BvEZOHFVEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvIsPkBsuaEGxH43SdO_TkioixQyWnu6S-BIgLZIcFeHwmAYDVuNIMd9YqTuAQozhI2ZxhOMBUwD9DDpVnGc7rzq72b8acLNPU3StOCi2rMK2iWX7PXrBo8fuvjedi-HDhaAURrVZnSi9f_5OAkrDik3BAJqKY-QwWV_u51-OTfoRbL5AaYzCUv8QwEIoidkrJllC487joCcjf6QzkwVvSWh4dk9NDBHQAJSqCBEVVaG8GwlMwlVhJmKdigmloXXzME8pG8cRLUqIP2mzgqIiq8N_CRc1J49PtKt6AD01yu85cHDyspE2bc_yuDW9fOx2sVEi8jWMahlA&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKN-BvEZOHFVEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "5nvPRbTg4O7cvlv5wD0WtZSCoQdm-HNsh2k61GhEcQU", "title": "Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO)", "body": "## What Is Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO)?\n\nKnowledge process outsourcing (KPO) is the [outsourcing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsourcing.asp) of core, information-related business activities. KPO involves contracting out work to individuals that typically have advanced degrees and expertise in a specialized area.\n\nThe information-related work can be carried out by workers in a different company or by a subsidiary of the same organization. The subsidiary may be in the same country or in an [offshore](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offshore.asp) location to save costs or other resources.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) contracts out knowledge-based work to qualified subject matter experts.\n* Companies utilize KPO when they are looking for specialized knowledge and expertise and when they have a shortage of skilled professionals on staff.\n* Ideally, companies look to KPO to simultaneously obtain a highly skilled workforce at a lower cost.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 29 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:29\n\n#### Click Play to Learn What Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) Is\n\n## Understanding Knowledge Process Outsourcing\n\nKnowledge process outsourcing is the purposeful allocation of relatively high-level tasks involving specialized knowledge or problem-solving to an outside organization or third party that has a high level of subject matter expertise, often located in a different geographic region than the company itself.\n\nKPO is different from [business process outsourcing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-process-outsourcing.asp) (BPO), which involves the outsourcing of labor and other operational work to a [third party](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/third-party.asp) to save money. Although KPO is a subset of BPO, KPO involves far more specialized, analytical, and knowledge-based work.\n\nCompanies that engage in KPO look to obtain highly educated and skilled individuals without having the cost of training and developing those workers to execute one-off or special projects that are not part of recurring activities. Through KPO, a company can quickly add experts in specific fields to boost competitiveness and increase earnings or to accomplish special tasks for which there is no need to internally hire subject matter experts for permanent roles on a full-time basis.\n\n## Types of KPO Services\n\nSome common example of KPO outsourcing domains include:\n\n* Financial consultants\n* Research and development ([R&D](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp))\n* Business operations (management consulting)\n* Technical analysis\n* Investments\n* Legal\n* Medical & healthcare\n* Data analysis and interpretation\n\n## Reasons for Knowledge Process Outsourcing\n\nCompanies utilize KPO when they are looking for specialized knowledge and expertise where that knowledge base or skills cannot be found in-house. However, companies that engage in KPO offshore also typically do so in order to reduce costs by hiring skilled workers earning lower wages in another location instead of hiring one directly as an employee. Ideally, companies look to KPO to simultaneously obtain a highly skilled workforce at a lower cost.\n\nFor example, a [manufacturer](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-analysis/091016/key-financial-ratios-manufacturing-companies.asp) might use raw materials, add value to those materials through various processes, and then sell the result as a final product. The company might look to KPO to determine how to improve efficiency in its production process so that it can deliver maximum value for the lowest possible total cost. The result of KPO might also help the company create a competitive advantage.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of KPO\n\nKPO can help companies reduce operational or production costs by creating new processes or streamlining efficiency. KPO also fills the gap or need for skilled employees in a particular field. KPO also frees up existing staff, including management, to do other work, boosting efficiency and productivity.\n\nThe flexibility that comes with KPO allows a company to increase or reduce staff easily. For example, if economic conditions worsen, a company can easily reduce its KPO staff to cut costs. Conversely, a company can quickly hire specialized staff to boost [profits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp) or revenue. KPO helps a company to be more nimble and adapt to the changes in its industry and competitive landscape.\n\nHowever, disadvantages do exist with KPO. Privacy of intellectual property and business security can be compromised if classified or proprietary information is lost, copied, or brought to a competitor. Companies have less control over the hiring process of outsourced workers. As a result, a company might not be able to ensure the character of its outsourced employees or the quality of their work. \n\nImplementing KPO can be time- and resource-intensive to establish a successful operation. Moreover, communication can be a concern and a challenge, due to legal, language, and cultural barriers. Another disadvantage might be that existing employees might feel threatened by the hiring of outsourced workers and feel their jobs are at risk. \n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssTxOizcMfRMmms6itQ8qMvPoUPfQvLUyBm-ifIfBGii13qD1G02J7M78k68gH-KqJlUjKH8nPWp2pWYD6UP4PuzCoRPgm2090HL2DAyIn46O9cjR7UNC8LIU57l_bjil2SVZFjlREPSSYyWXXf_V1a9dUJhrxB-atQFD3PGVdZheATQmO0FhTssPfbQc_46huXDnwBXwa-8dERHRryS4DviX6UK4-88PHkH1THWUsNltGmoE0lkHSAr0h9N1C07epJ7womB4AQSKtk3CfmZjXCoRG9d9W5lGNX0S_51OKE0s1ZICe5ERtSqY8wU1XTGMMV4uCMwJWGUgJEJA-OX4R_rE2HzA&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEthcFokd25mEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

Each of the KOSPI indexes are [capitalization-weighted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp) market averages. \n\nThe best-known of these indexes is the KOSPI 200, which comprises the 200 largest publicly-traded common stocks traded in Korea, tracking roughly 70% of the market value of the overall Korean Stock Exchange.1﻿ The KOSPI 200 is used as a rough benchmark when investors or traders refer to the performance of the Korean Exchange. For this reason, and because its components are [large-cap stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp), people compare the KOSPI 200 to the S&P 500 in the United States.\n\nAs of 2021, major KOSPI 200 components included consumer product maker Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, semiconductor manufacturer SK Hynix, utility provider Korea Electric Power, and Shinhan Bank.2﻿\n\n## Understanding the Korean Composite Stock Price Indexes\n\nThe Korean Composite Stock Price Indexes (KOSPI) first debuted in the early 1980s, with several variants rolled out in subsequent years, including the KOSPI 100 which focused on mid-caps, and the KOSPI 50 which represents small caps. The KOSPI also refers to a family of indices tracking specific industries including chemicals and banks, and the KODI index, which specializes in [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) stocks. Also, the KOSPI appears on several other products that track the prices of futures, options, and sovereign bonds.\n\nNote that while KOSPI refers to the entire family of indexes, many market participants call the KOSPI 200 simply the KOSPI.\n\n## History of the KOSPI 200\n\nThe KOSPI 200 began trading at the start of January in 1983 at a value of 122.52.1﻿ Its base value, indexed to January 4, 1980, is 100. The KOSPI 200 rose more than 8-fold to a value of more than 1,000 by April of 1989, roughly two years following the Asian financial crisis. The index value surged to 1,997.06 by its 30th birthday at the end of 2012, trailing only the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Taiwan Stock Exchange over the same time frame. The KOSPI 200 index stood at roughly 2,470 by mid-2018, up more than 20-fold since its introduction.3﻿\n\nNotable dates for the KOSPI include June 17, 1988, when it gained about 8.5%, its largest one-day percentage gain. It also fell more than 12% on September 12, 2001, the day following the [9/11 terrorist attack](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0911/how-september-11-affected-the-u.s.-stock-market.aspx) in the U.S. The index closed above 2,000 for the first time on July 24, 2007.3﻿\n\nAnalysts, market participants, and the international financial news media all follow the KOSPI 200 to varying degrees. U.S.-based news outlets such as The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, as well as London-based Reuters, owned by Canada-based Thomson Reuters, often quote the index and use its values when reporting on market events in Korea.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

The Fed purchases Treasury securities to increase the supply of money and sells them to reduce long-term [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/122203.asp).1\n\nThe objective of OMOs is to adjust the level of reserve balances to manipulate the short-term interest rates and that affect other interest rates.1 The Federal Reserve conducts open market operations to achieve the desired target federal funds rate by buying or selling government bonds from or to commercial banks.2 \n \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Open market operations (OMO) refers to a central bank buying or selling short-term Treasuries and other securities in the open market in order to influence the money supply.\n* In the U.S., open market operations are a method the Fed uses to manipulate interest rates—specifically the federal funds rate used in interbank loans.\n* Buying securities adds money to the system, making loans easier to obtain and interest rates decline.\n* Selling securities from the central bank's balance sheet removes money from the system, making loans more expensive and increasing rates.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:53\n\n#### Open Market Operations Explained\n\n## Understanding Open Market Operations (OMO)\n\nTo understand open market operations, you first have to understand how the Federal Reserve, the [central bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) of the U.S., dictates the nation's [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp).\n\nIn an effort to keep the U.S. economy on an even keel and to forestall the ill effects of uncontrolled price inflation or deflation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve sets what's called a target [federal funds rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp).3 The federal funds rate is the interest percentage that [depository](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depository.asp) institutions charge each other for overnight loans. This constant flow of vast sums of money allows banks to keep their cash reserves high enough to meet the demands of customers while putting excess cash to use.4\n\nThe federal funds rate also is a benchmark for other interest rates, influencing the direction of everything from savings deposit rates to [home mortgage rates](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082014/mortgage-rates-rise-when-and-how-much.asp) and credit card interest.3\n\nBasically, open market operations are the tools the Fed uses to reach that target federal funds rate by buying and selling securities in the open market. The central bank is able to increase the money supply and lower the market interest rate by purchasing securities using newly created money. Similarly, the central bank can sell securities from its balance sheet and take money out of circulation, putting upward pressure on interest rates.1 \n \n\nOpen market operations allow the [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/federal-reserve.asp) to buy or sell Treasuries in such large quantities that it has an impact on the supply of money distributed in banks and other financial institutions around the U.S.1\n\n## Types of Open Market Operations (OMO)\n\nIn short, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve sets a target federal funds rate and then the  [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fomc.asp) (FOMC) implements the open market operations to achieve that rate.5\n\nThere are two types of OMOs. [Permanent open market operations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanent-open-market-operations.asp) (POMO) refers to the Fed (or any central bank) constantly using the open market to buy and sell securities in order to adjust the money supply. POMO has been one of the tools used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy and influence the American economy.\n\nIn contrast, temporary open market operations are used to add or drain reserves available to the banking system on a short-term basis, addressing reserve needs that are deemed to be transitory in nature. Unlike POMOs, which involve outright purchases or sales, these operations are either [repurchase agreements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repurchaseagreement.asp) (repos) or [reverse repurchase agreements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverserepurchaseagreement.asp) (reverse repos or RRPs). This means that the Fed undertakes the transaction with an agreement to do the opposite—buy back if it sells, or resell if it buys—in the future.1\n\n \n U.S. Treasuries are government bonds that are purchased by many individual consumers as a safe investment. They are also traded on the money markets and are purchased and held in large quantities by financial institutions and brokerages.\n\n## Up or Down?\n\nThere are only two ways Treasury rates can move, and that's up or down. In the Federal Reserve's language, the policy is expansionary or contractionary.6\n\nIf the Fed's goal is [expansionary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expansionary_policy.asp), it buys Treasuries in order to pour cash into the banks. That puts pressure on the banks to lend that money out to consumers and businesses. As the banks compete for customers, interest rates drift downwards. Consumers are able to borrow more to buy more. Businesses are eager to borrow more to expand.6\n\nIf the Fed's goal is [contractionary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractionary-policy.asp), it sells Treasuries in order to pull money out of the system. Money gets tight, and interest rates drift upwards. Consumers pull back on their spending. Businesses trim their plans for growth, and the economy slows down.6\n\n## Why Does the Federal Reserve Conduct Open Market Operations?\n\nBasically, open market operations are the tools the Federal Reserve (the Fed) uses to achieve the desired target federal funds rate by buying and selling, mainly, U.S. Treasuries in the open market. The Fed can increase the money supply and lower the market interest rate by purchasing securities using newly created money. Similarly, the central bank can sell securities from its balance sheet and take money out of circulation, thereby pressuring market interest rates to rise.\n\n## What Are Permanent Open Market Operations (POMO)?\n\nPermanent open market operations (POMO) refers to a central bank practice of constantly using the open market to buy and sell securities in order to adjust the money supply. It has been one of the tools used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy and influence the American economy. POMOs are the opposite of temporary open market operations, which involve repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements that are designed to temporarily add or drain reserves available to the banking system.7\n\n## How Does the Federal Funds Rate Affect Banks?\n\nBy law, commercial banks must maintain a reserve equal to a certain percentage of their deposits in an account at a Federal Reserve bank. Any money in their reserve that exceeds the required level is available for lending to other banks that might have a shortfall. The interest rate the lending bank can charge for these loans is called the federal funds rate, or fed funds rate. Banks often base their interest rates for consumer or business loans on the federal funds rate.", "timestamp": 1655172709, "digest": "rJTf2tHdZLuG-DckLB6_2h_PHMs4AX97PMDHiH6oLBM", "contributor": "0x529B2991E1630FF36818eC200f394f439750be4C"}

{"id": "qfhYXYdEP5BMbhqrzLnBqlAXXKI-DXOR90Ey2yUHKF4", "title": "Operating Leverage", "body": "## What Is Operating Leverage?\n\nOperating leverage is a cost-accounting formula that measures the degree to which a firm or project can increase operating income by increasing revenue. A business that generates sales with a high [gross margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossmargin.asp) and low variable costs has high operating leverage.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Operating leverage is used to calculate a company’s break-even point and help set appropriate selling prices to cover all costs and generate a profit.\n* Companies with high operating leverage must cover a larger amount of fixed costs each month regardless of whether they sell any units of product.\n* Low-operating-leverage companies may have high costs that vary directly with their sales but have lower fixed costs to cover each month.\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 27 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n2:27\n\n#### The Operating Leverage And DOL\n\n## Understanding Operating Leverage\n\nThe higher the [degree of operating leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/degreeofoperatingleverage.asp), the greater the potential danger from forecasting risk, in which a relatively small error in forecasting sales can be magnified into large errors in [cash flow projections](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp).\n\n### The Operating Leverage Formula Is:\n\n\\\\text{Degree of operating leverage} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Contribution margin}}{\\\\text{Profit}}Degree of operating leverage=ProfitContribution margin​\n\nThis can be restated as: \n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Degree of operating leverage} = \\\\frac{Q\\*CM}{Q\\*CM - \\\\text{Fixed operating costs}}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &Q = \\\\text{unit quantity}\\\\\\\\ &CM = \\\\text{contribution margin (price - variable cost per unit)}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Degree of operating leverage=*Q*∗*CM*−Fixed operating costs*Q*∗*CM*​where:*Q*=unit quantity*CM*=contribution margin (price - variable cost per unit)​\n\nThe operating leverage formula is used to calculate a company’s break-even point and help set appropriate selling prices to cover all costs and generate a profit. The formula can reveal how well a company is using its fixed-cost items, such as its warehouse and machinery and equipment, to generate profits. The more profit a company can squeeze out of the same amount of fixed assets, the higher its operating leverage.\n\nOne conclusion companies can learn from examining operating leverage is that firms that minimize fixed costs can increase their profits without making any changes to the selling price, contribution margin, or the number of units they sell.\n\n## Example\n\nFor example, Company A sells 500,000 products for a unit price of $6 each. The company’s fixed costs are $800,000. It costs $0.05 in variable costs per unit to make each product.\n\nCalculate company A’s degree of operating leverage as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\frac{500,000\\*\\\\left(\\\\$6.00 - \\\\$0.05 \\\\right )}{500,000\\*\\\\left(\\\\$6.00 - \\\\$0.05 \\\\right )-\\\\$800,000}\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{\\\\$2,975,000}{\\\\$2,175,000}\\\\\\\\ &=1.37 \\\\text{ or } 137\\\\%. \\\\end{aligned}​500,000∗($6.00−$0.05)−$800,000500,000∗($6.00−$0.05)​=$2,175,000$2,975,000​=1.37 or 137%.​\n\nA 10% revenue increase should result in a 13.7% increase in operating income (10% x 1.37 = 13.7%).\n\n## High and Low Operating Leverage\n\nIt is important to compare operating leverage between companies in the same industry, as some industries have higher fixed costs than others. The concept of a high or low ratio is then more clearly defined.\n\nMost of a company’s costs are fixed costs that recur each month, such as rent, regardless of sales volume. As long as a business earns a substantial profit on each sale and sustains adequate sales volume, fixed costs are covered and profits are earned.\n\nOther company costs are variable costs that are only incurred when sales occur. This includes labor to assemble products and the cost of raw materials used to make products. Some companies earn less profit on each sale but can have a lower sales volume and still generate enough to cover fixed costs.\n\nFor example, a software business has greater fixed costs in developers’ salaries and lower variable costs in software sales. As such, the business has high operating leverage. In contrast, a computer consulting firm charges its clients hourly and doesn't need expensive office space because its consultants work in clients' offices. This results in variable consultant wages and low fixed operating costs. The business thus has low operating leverage.\n\nMost of [Microsoft’s](https://www.investopedia.com/microsoft-stock-could-break-out-to-new-highs-4846614) costs are fixed, such as expenses for upfront development and marketing. With each dollar in sales earned beyond the break-even point, the company makes a profit, but Microsoft has high operating leverage.\n\nConversely, Walmart retail stores have low fixed costs and large variable costs, especially for merchandise. Because Walmart sells a huge volume of items and pays upfront for each unit it sells, its cost of goods sold increases as sales increase. Because of this, Walmart stores have low operating leverage.\n\n## What Does Operating Leverage Tell You?\n\nThe operating leverage formula is used to calculate a company’s break-even point and help set appropriate selling prices to cover all costs and generate a profit. This can reveal how well a company is using its fixed-cost items, such as its warehouse and machinery and equipment, to generate profits. The more profit a company can squeeze out of the same amount of fixed assets, the higher its operating leverage.\n\n \n \n\nOne conclusion companies can learn from examining operating leverage is that firms that minimize fixed costs can increase their profits without making any changes to the selling price, contribution margin, or the number of units they sell.\n\n## What Is the Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL)?\n\nThe degree of operating leverage (DOL) is a multiple that measures how much the operating income of a company will change in response to a change in sales. Companies with a large proportion of fixed costs (or costs that don't change with production) to variable costs (costs that change with production volume) have higher levels of operating leverage. The DOL ratio assists analysts in determining the impact of any change in sales on company earnings or profit.\n\n## What Are Examples of High and Low Operating Leverage?\n\nCompanies with high fixed costs tend to have high operating leverage, such as those with a great deal of research & development and marketing. With each dollar in sales earned beyond the break-even point, the company makes a profit. Conversely, retail stores tend to have low fixed costs and large variable costs, especially for merchandise. Because retailers sell a large volume of items and pay upfront for each unit sold, COGS increases as sales increase. Because of this, such stores often have low operating leverage.", "timestamp": 1655172866, "digest": "PRuGpIqZ8ikqmx4CoGXhQwDzSaaCyPiA1ieNIh3JmEU", "contributor": "0xCA995bA5397441eB0EA7A24c11b02f8CdC2f18e7"}
{"id": "X1M8xZ-J1EpgAnLmngs73a_-G8BQ4o9j5FEWHN3Dbjk", "title": "Kurtosis", "body": "## Definition of Kurtosis\n\nLike [skewness](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/skewness.asp), kurtosis is a statistical measure that is used to [describe distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp). Whereas skewness differentiates extreme values in one versus the other tail, kurtosis measures extreme values in either tail. Distributions with large kurtosis exhibit tail data exceeding the tails of the normal distribution (e.g., five or more standard deviations from the mean). Distributions with low kurtosis exhibit tail data that are generally less extreme than the tails of the normal distribution.\n\nFor investors, high kurtosis of the return distribution implies the investor will experience occasional extreme returns (either positive or negative), more extreme than the usual + or - three standard deviations from the mean that is predicted by the normal distribution of returns. This phenomenon is known as *kurtosis risk*.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 16 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:16\n\n#### Kurtosis\n\n## Breaking Down Kurtosis\n\nKurtosis is a measure of the combined weight of a distribution's tails relative to the center of the distribution. When a set of approximately normal data is graphed via a histogram, it shows a bell peak and most data within three standard deviations (plus or minus) of the mean. However, when high kurtosis is present, the tails extend farther than the three standard deviations of the normal bell-curved distribution.\n\nKurtosis is sometimes confused with a measure of the peakedness of a distribution. However, kurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution's tails in relation to its overall shape. A distribution can be infinitely peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can be perfectly flat-topped with infinite kurtosis. Thus, kurtosis measures \"tailedness,\" not \"peakedness.\"\n\n## Types of Kurtosis\n\nThere are three categories of kurtosis that can be displayed by a set of data. All measures of kurtosis are compared against a standard normal distribution, or bell curve.\n\nThe first category of kurtosis is a [mesokurtic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mesokurtic.asp) distribution. This distribution has a kurtosis statistic similar to that of the normal distribution, meaning the extreme value characteristic of the distribution is similar to that of a normal distribution.\n\nThe second category is a [leptokurtic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leptokurtic.asp) distribution. Any distribution that is leptokurtic displays greater kurtosis than a mesokurtic distribution. Characteristics of this distribution is one with long tails (outliers.) The prefix of \"lepto-\" means \"skinny,\" making the shape of a leptokurtic distribution easier to remember. The \"skinniness\" of a leptokurtic distribution is a consequence of the outliers, which stretch the horizontal axis of the histogram graph, making the bulk of the data appear in a narrow (\"skinny\") vertical range. Thus leptokurtic distributions are sometimes characterized as \"concentrated toward the mean,\" but the more relevant issue (especially for investors) is there are occasional extreme outliers that cause this \"concentration\" appearance. Examples of leptokurtic distributions are the T-distributions with small [degrees of freedom](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/degrees-of-freedom.asp).\n\nThe final type of distribution is a [platykurtic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/platykurtic.asp) distribution. These types of distributions have short tails (paucity of outliers.) The prefix of \"platy-\" means \"broad,\" and it is meant to describe a short and broad-looking peak, but this is an historical error. [Uniform distributions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uniform-distribution.asp) are platykurtic and have broad peaks, but the beta (.5,1) distribution is also platykurtic and has an infinitely pointy peak. The reason both these distributions are platykurtic is their extreme values are less than that of the normal distribution. For investors, platykurtic return distributions are stable and predictable, in the sense that there will rarely (if ever) be extreme (outlier) returns.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "xdMKpSFSGIbtkkyPhB39wcz1CzYnr1vKN8ppe_J-V7I", "title": "Operating Income", "body": "## What Is Operating Income?\n\nOperating income is an accounting figure that measures the amount of [profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp) realized from a business's operations, after deducting operating expenses such as wages, [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp), and [cost of goods sold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) (COGS).\n\nOperating income*—*also called income from operations*—*takes a company's [gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp), which is equivalent to total revenue minus COGS, and subtracts all operating expenses. A business's operating expenses are costs incurred from normal operating activities and include items such as office supplies and utilities.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Operating income reports the amount of profit realized from a business's ongoing operations.\n* Operating income is calculated by subtracting operating expenses from a company's gross income.\n* Analyzing operating income is useful because it doesn't include one-off items such as taxes that may skew a company's profit in a given year.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 40 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:40\n\n#### Operating Income\n\n## Understanding Operating Income\n\nOperating income is a measurement that shows how much of a company's revenue will eventually become profits. Operating income is similar to a company's [earnings before interest and taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT); it is also referred to as the operating profit or recurring profit. The one big difference between [operating income and EBIT](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012015/what-difference-between-ebit-and-operating-income.asp) is that EBIT includes any [non-operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-operating-income.asp) the company generates.\n\nAnalyzing operating income is helpful to investors because it doesn't include taxes and other one-off items that might skew profit or net income. A company that's generating an increasing amount of operating income is seen as favorable because it means that the company's management is generating more revenue while controlling expenses, production costs, and overhead.\n\n## How to Calculate Operating Income\n\nThe operating income formula is outlined below:\n\n**\\\\text{Operating Income} = \\\\text{Gross Income} - \\\\text{Operating Expenses}Operating Income=Gross Income−Operating Expenses**\n\nOperating expenses include [selling, general, and administrative expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sga.asp) (SG&A), depreciation, and amortization, and other operating expenses. Operating income excludes items such as investments in other firms (non-operating income), taxes, and interest expenses. In addition, nonrecurring items, such as cash paid for a lawsuit settlement, are not included. Operating income is required to calculate the [operating margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp), which describes a company's operating efficiency.\n\nOperating income is the amount of income a company generates from its core operations, meaning it excludes any income and expenses not directly tied to the core business.\n\n## Operating Income Examples\n\nMany companies focus on operating income when measuring the operational success of the business. For example, Company ABC, a hospital and drug firm, reports an operating income rise by 20% year-over-year to $25 million during the first two quarters of its fiscal year. The company realized an increase in revenue and operating income due to an increase in patient volume over the two quarters. The rise in patient visits was driven by two of the company's new immunotherapy drugs: One drug treats lung cancer and the other drug treats melanoma.\n\nIn another example, we have Company Red, which reports financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal year. The company saw operating income rise by 37%, when compared with the same period in the previous year. The report of the increase in operating income is especially important because the company is looking to merge with Company Blue, and shareholders are slated to vote on the potential merger next month. While Company Red's first-quarter sales did fall by 3%, its operating income growth could potentially give Company Blue shareholders confidence in voting to merge the two companies.\n\n## How to Find Operating Income\n\nThe example below highlights how to find and calculate operating income using the [income statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp) for Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)). The figures are from the quarter ending June 29, 2019.\n\n* Operating income for June 2019 was $11.5 billion (highlighted in blue). Note that the numbers are in millions of U.S. dollars.\n* Operating income is calculated before, or located slightly above, net income.\n* We can see that operating income is the result of gross income—or gross margin on Apple's income statement—of $20.2 billion minus operating expenses of $8.6 billion.1\n\nInvestopedia / Sabrina Jiang\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nIt's important to note that operating income is [different than net income](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122414/what-difference-between-operating-income-and-net-income.asp) (as well as gross profit). Operating income includes more expense line items than gross profit, which primarily includes the costs of production. Operating income includes both COGS—or cost of sales—and [operating expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noninterest-expense.asp). However, operating income does not include items such as other income, non-operating income, and non-operating expenses. Instead, those figures are included in the net income calculation.\n\n## Is Operating Income the Same as Profits?\n\nNot exactly. Operating income is what is left over after a company subtracts the cost of goods sold (COGS) and other operating expenses from the sales revenues it receives. However, it does not take into consideration taxes, interest or financing charges, or depreciation and amortization.\n\n## Can a Company Have a High Operating Income but Lose Money?\n\nWhile a good operating income is often indicative of profitability, there may be cases when a company earns money from operations but must spend more on interest and taxes. This could be due to a one-time charge, poor financial decisions made by the company, or an increasing interest rate environment that impacts outstanding debts. Alternatively, a company may earn a great deal of interest income, which would not show up as operating income.\n\n## What Is Non-Operating Income?\n\nIn contrast to operating income, non-operating income is the portion of an organization's income that is derived from activities not related to its core business operations. It can include items such as [dividend ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp)income, interest, gains or losses from investments, as well as those incurred in foreign exchange and asset write-downs.\n\n## Where Would I Find a Company's Operating Income?\n\nOperating income is recorded on the income statement, and can be found toward the bottom of the statement as its own line item. It should appear next to non-operating income, helping investors to distinguish between the two and recognize which income came from what sources.", "timestamp": 1655172796, "digest": "CaDwMuTI3S8tgd6hQhW7VQUGLk11yAL3xj9K1gz8b8s", "contributor": "0xfEeD9eF0A55184Edf149DdAaC731D49fADaE8396"}

The principles of the study of organizational behavior are applied primarily in attempts to make businesses operate more effectively.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Organizational behavior is the academic study of how people interact within groups and its principles are applied primarily in attempts to make businesses operate more effectively.\n* The study of organizational behavior includes areas of research dedicated to improving job performance, increasing job satisfaction, promoting innovation, and encouraging leadership and is a foundation of corporate human resources.\n* The Hawthorne Effect, which describes the way test subjects' behavior may change when they know they are being observed, is the best-known study of organizational behavior.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 9 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:09\n\n#### Organizational Behavior\n\n## Understanding Organizational Behavior (OB)\n\nThe study of organizational behavior includes areas of research dedicated to improving job performance, increasing job satisfaction, promoting innovation, and encouraging [leadership](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadership.asp). Each has its own recommended actions, such as reorganizing groups, modifying compensation structures, or changing methods of [performance evaluation](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-a-performance-appraisal-4586834).\n\n### Organizational Behavior Origins\n\nThe study of organizational behavior has its roots in the late 1920s, when the Western Electric Company launched a now-famous series of studies of the behavior of workers at its Hawthorne Works plant in Cicero, Ill.1\n\nResearchers there set out to determine whether workers could be made to be more productive if their environment was upgraded with better lighting and other design improvements. To their surprise, the researchers found that the environment was less important than social factors. It was more important, for example, that people got along with their co-workers and felt their bosses appreciated them.\n\nThose initial findings inspired a series of wide-ranging studies between 1924 and 1933.1 They included the effects on productivity of work breaks, isolation, and lighting, among many other factors.\n\nThe [Hawthorne Effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hawthorne-effect.asp)—which describes the way test subjects' behavior may change when they know they are being observed—is the best-known study of organizational behavior. Researchers are taught to consider whether or not (and to what degree) the Hawthorne Effect may skew their findings on human behavior.\n\nOrganizational behavior was not fully recognized by the American Psychological Association as a field of academic study until the 1970s.2 However, the Hawthorne research is credited for validating organizational behavior as a legitimate field of study, and it's the foundation of the [human resources](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humanresources.asp) (HR) profession as we now know it.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nThe leaders of the Hawthorne study had a couple of radical notions. They thought they could use the techniques of scientific observation to increase an employee's amount and quality of work, and they did not look at workers as interchangeable resources. Workers, they thought, were unique in terms of their psychology and potential fit within a company.\n\nOver the following years, the concept of organizational behavior widened. Beginning with World War II, researchers began focusing on logistics and management science. Studies by the Carnegie School in the 1950s and 1960s solidified these rationalist approaches to decision-making.3\n\nToday, those and other studies have evolved into modern theories of business structure and decision-making. The new frontiers of organizational behavior are the cultural components of organizations, such as how race, class, and gender roles affect group building and productivity. These studies take into account how identity and background inform decision-making.\n\nAcademic programs focusing on organizational behavior are found in business schools, as well as at schools of social work and psychology. These programs draw from the fields of anthropology, ethnography, and leadership studies, and use quantitative, qualitative, and computer models as methods to explore and test ideas.\n\nDepending on the program, one can study specific topics within organizational behavior or broader fields within it. Specific topics covered include cognition, decision-making, learning, motivation, negotiation, impressions, group process, stereotyping, and power and influence. The broader study areas include social systems, the dynamics of change, markets, relationships between organizations and their environments, how social movements influence markets, and the power of [social networks](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/081315/3-social-media-networks-facebook.asp).\n\n## Examples of Organizational Behavior\n\nFindings from organizational behavior research are used by executives and human relations professionals to better understand a [business’s culture](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-culture.asp), how that culture helps or hinders productivity and employee retention, and how to evaluate candidates' skills and personality during the hiring process.\n\nOrganizational behavior theories inform the real-world evaluation and management of groups of people. There are several components:\n\n* Personality plays a large role in the way a person interacts with groups and produces work. Understanding a candidate's personality, either through tests or through conversation, helps determine whether they are a good fit for an organization.\n* Leadership—what it looks like and where it comes from—is a rich topic of debate and study within the field of organizational behavior. Leadership can be broad, focused, centralized or de-centralized, decision-oriented, intrinsic in a person’s personality, or simply a result of a position of authority.\n* Power, authority, and politics all operate inter-dependently in a workplace. Understanding the appropriate ways these elements are exhibited and used, as agreed upon by workplace rules and ethical guidelines, are key components to running a cohesive business.\n\n## Why Is Organizational Behavior Important?\n\nOrganizational behavior describes how people interact with one another inside of an organization, such as a business. These interactions subsequently influence how the organization itself behaves and how well it performs. For businesses, organizational behavior is used to streamline efficiency, improve productivity, and spark innovation to give firms a competitive edge.\n\n## What Are the 4 Elements of Organizational Behavior?\n\nThe four elements of organizational behavior are people, structure, technology, and the external environment. By understanding how these elements interact with one another, improvements can be made. While some factors are more easily controlled by the organization—such as its structure or people hired—it still must be able to respond to external factors and changes in the economic environment.\n\n## What Are the 3 Levels of Organizational Behavior?\n\nThe first is the individual level, which involves organizational psychology and understanding human behavior and incentives. The second level is groups, which involves social psychology and sociological insights into human interaction and group dynamics. The top-level is the organizational level, where organization theory and sociology come into play to undertake systems-level analyses and the study of how firms engage with one another in the marketplace.\n\n## What Are Some Common Problems that Organizational Behavior Tries to Solve?\n\nOrganizational behavior can be used by managers and consultants to improve the performance of an organization and to address certain key issues that commonly arise. These may include a lack of direction or strategic vision for a company, difficulty getting employees on board with that vision, pacifying workplace conflict or creating a more amenable work environment, issues with training employees, poor communication or feedback, and so on.", "timestamp": 1655173104, "digest": "keTTAFuHcCSRbHGgSLlLrd16NgNFO-XJED7ecyDCaYw", "contributor": "0xd97952A550A92BA0989255EEEACca3f5C901fCE2"}

{"id": "eVjDnR4cpL4CRn5YRqHkfELsqjB0e_jcjTSk8RkKvp0", "title": "Opportunity Cost", "body": "## What Is Opportunity Cost?\n\nOpportunity costs represent the potential benefits that an individual, investor, or business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. Because opportunity costs are unseen by definition, they can be easily overlooked. Understanding the potential missed opportunities when a business or individual chooses one investment over another allows for better decision making. \n \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Opportunity cost is the forgone benefit that would have been derived from an option not chosen.\n* To properly evaluate opportunity costs, the costs and benefits of every option available must be considered and weighed against the others.\n* Considering the value of opportunity costs can guide individuals and organizations to more profitable decision making.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 35 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:35\n\n#### Opportunity Cost\n\n## Formula and Calculation of Opportunity Cost\n\n\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{Opportunity Cost}=\\\\text{FO}-\\\\text{CO} \\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{FO}=\\\\text{Return on best forgone option} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{CO}=\\\\text{Return on chosen option} \\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned}​Opportunity Cost=FO−COwhere:FO=Return on best forgone optionCO=Return on chosen option​\n\nThe formula for calculating an opportunity cost is simply the difference between the expected returns of each option. Say that you have option A—to invest in the stock market, hoping to generate [capital gain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp) returns. Meanwhile, option B is to reinvest your money back into the business, expecting that newer equipment will increase production efficiency, leading to lower operational expenses and a higher [profit margin](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122314/what-difference-between-gross-margin-and-net-margin.asp).\n\nAssume the expected [return on investment (ROI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) in the stock market is 12% over the next year, and your company expects the equipment update to generate a 10% return over the same period. The opportunity cost of choosing the equipment over the stock market is (12% - 10%), which equals two percentage points. In other words, by investing in the business, you would forgo the opportunity to earn a higher return.\n\nWhile [financial reports](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) do not show opportunity costs, business owners often use the concept to make educated decisions when they have multiple options before them. [Bottlenecks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottleneck.asp), for instance, often result in opportunity costs.\n\n## What Opportunity Cost Can Tell You\n\nOpportunity cost analysis plays a crucial role in determining a business’s [capital structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp). A firm incurs an expense in issuing both [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp) and [equity capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp#:\\~:text=Equity%20is%20used%20as%20capital,equity%20%28by%20selling%20stock%29.) to compensate lenders and shareholders for the risk of investment, yet each also carries an opportunity cost.\n\nFunds used to make payments on loans, for example, cannot be invested in stocks or bonds, which offer the potential for [investment income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp). The company must decide if the expansion made by the [leveraging power of debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111813/optimal-use-financial-leverage-corporate-capital-structure.asp) will generate greater profits than it could make through investments.\n\nA firm tries to weigh the costs and benefits of issuing debt and stock, including both monetary and nonmonetary considerations, to arrive at an optimal balance that minimizes opportunity costs. Because opportunity cost is a forward-looking consideration, the actual [rate of return (RoR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) for both options is unknown today, making this evaluation tricky in practice.\n\nAssume that the company in the above example forgoes new equipment and instead invests in the stock market. If the selected securities decrease in value, the company could end up losing money rather than enjoying the expected 12% return.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, assume that the investment yields a return of 0%, meaning the company gets out exactly what is put in. The opportunity cost of choosing this option is 10% to 0%, or 10%. It is equally possible that, had the company chosen new equipment, there would be no effect on production efficiency, and profits would remain stable. The opportunity cost of choosing this option is then 12% rather than the expected 2%.\n\nIt is important to compare investment options that have a similar risk. Comparing a [Treasury bill](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp), which is virtually risk free, to investment in a highly [volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) stock can cause a misleading calculation. Both options may have expected returns of 5%, but the U.S. government backs the RoR of the T-bill, while there is no such guarantee in the stock market. While the opportunity cost of either option is 0%, the T-bill is the safer bet when you consider the relative risk of each investment.\n\n### Comparing investments\n\nWhen assessing the potential profitability of various investments, businesses look for the option that is likely to [yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp) the greatest return. Often, they can determine this by looking at the expected RoR for an investment vehicle. However, businesses must also consider the opportunity cost of each alternative option.1\n\nAssume that, given $20,000 of available funds, a business must choose between investing funds in [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-securities.asp) or using it to purchase new machinery. No matter which option the business chooses, the potential profit that it gives up by not investing in the other option is the opportunity cost.\n\nIf the business goes with the first option, at the end of the first year, its investment will be worth $22,000. The formula to calculate RoR is \\[(Current Value - Initial Value) ÷ Current Value\\] × 100. In this example, \\[($22,000 - $20,000) ÷ $20,000\\] × 100 = 10%, so the RoR on the investment is 10%. For the purposes of this example, let’s assume it would net 10% every year after as well. At a 10% RoR, with [compounding interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp), the investment will increase by $2,000 in year 1, $2,200 in year 2, and $2,420 in year 3.\n\nAlternatively, if the business purchases a new machine, it will be able to increase its production of widgets. The machine setup and employee training will be intensive, and the new machine will not be up to maximum efficiency for the first couple of years. Let’s assume it would net the company an additional $500 in profits in the first year, after accounting for the additional expenses for training. The business will net $2,000 in year 2 and $5,000 in all future years.\n\nSince the company has limited funds to invest in either option, it must make a choice. According to this, the opportunity cost for choosing the securities makes sense in the first and second years. However, by the third year, an analysis of the opportunity cost indicates that the new machine is the better option ($500 + $2,000 + $5,000 - $2,000 - $2,200 - $2,420) = $880.\n\n## The Difference Between Opportunity Cost and Sunk Cost\n\nA [sunk cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp) is money already spent in the past, while opportunity cost is the potential returns not earned in the future on an investment because the capital was invested elsewhere.1\n\nBuying 1,000 shares of company A at $10 a share, for instance, represents a sunk cost of $10,000. This is the amount of money paid out to invest, and getting that money back requires liquidating stock at or above the [purchase price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/purchaseprice.asp). But the opportunity cost instead asks where that $10,000 could have been put to better use.\n\nFrom an accounting perspective, a sunk cost also could refer to the initial outlay to purchase an expensive piece of heavy equipment, which might be [amortized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp) over time, but which is sunk in the sense that you won’t be getting it back.2\n\nAn opportunity cost would be to consider the forgone returns possibly earned elsewhere when you buy a piece of heavy equipment with an expected ROI of 5% vs. one with an ROI of 4%.\n\nAgain, an opportunity cost describes the returns that one could have earned if the money were instead invested in another instrument. Thus, while 1,000 shares in company A eventually might sell for $12 a share, netting a profit of $2,000, company B increased in value from $10 a share to $15 during the same period.\n\nIn this scenario, investing $10,000 in company A returned $2,000, while the same amount invested in company B would have returned a larger $5,000. The $3,000 difference is the opportunity cost of choosing company A over company B.\n\nAs an investor who has already sunk money into investments, you might find another investment that promises greater returns. The opportunity cost of holding the underperforming asset may rise to the point where the [rational investment option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-trader.asp) is to sell and invest in the more promising investment.\n\n## Opportunity Cost and Risk\n\nIn economics, [risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp) describes the possibility that an investment’s actual and projected returns are different and that the investor loses some or all of the principal. Opportunity cost concerns the possibility that the returns of a chosen investment are lower than the returns of a forgone investment.\n\nThe key difference is that risk compares the actual performance of an investment against the projected performance of the same investment, while opportunity cost compares the actual performance of an investment against the actual performance of another investment.\n\nStill, one could consider opportunity costs when deciding between two risk profiles. If investment A is risky but has an ROI of 25%, while investment B is far less risky but only has an ROI of 5%, even though investment A may succeed, it may not. And if it fails, then the opportunity cost of going with option B will be salient.\n\n## Example of Opportunity Cost\n\nBefore making big decisions like buying a home or [starting a business](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/start-business-in-depressed-economy.asp), you probably will scrupulously research the pros and cons of your financial decision, but most day-to-day choices aren’t made with a full understanding of the potential opportunity costs.\n\nWhen feeling cautious about a purchase, for instance, many people will check the balance of their savings account before spending money. But they often won’t think about the things that they must give up when they make that spending decision.\n\nThe problem comes up when you never look at what else you could do with your money or buy things without considering the lost opportunities. Having takeout for lunch occasionally can be a wise decision, especially if it gets you out of the office for a much-needed break.\n\nHowever, buying one cheeseburger every day for the next 25 years could lead to several missed opportunities. Aside from the missed opportunity for better health, spending that $4.50 on a burger could add up to just over $52,000 in that time frame, assuming a very achievable 5% RoR.\n\nThis is a simple example, but the core message holds for a variety of situations. It may sound like overkill to think about opportunity costs every time you want to buy a candy bar or go on vacation. But opportunity costs are everywhere and occur with every decision made, big or small.\n\n## What is a simple definition of opportunity cost?\n\nOpportunity cost is often overlooked by investors. In essence, it refers to the hidden cost associated with not taking an alternative course of action. If, for example, a company pursues a particular business strategy without first considering the merits of alternative strategies available to them, they might fail to appreciate their opportunity costs and the possibility that they could have done even better had they chosen another path.\n\n## Is opportunity cost a real cost?\n\nOpportunity cost does not show up directly on a company’s financial statements. Economically speaking, though, opportunity costs are still very real. Yet because opportunity cost is a relatively abstract concept, many companies, executives, and investors fail to account for it in their everyday decision making.\n\n## What is an example of opportunity cost?\n\nConsider the case of an investor who, at age 18, was encouraged by their parents to always put 100% of their disposable income into bonds. Over the next 50 years, this investor dutifully invested $5,000 per year in bonds, achieving an average annual return of 2.50% and retiring with a portfolio worth nearly $500,000. Although this result might seem impressive, it is less so when one considers the investor’s opportunity cost. If, for example, they had instead invested half of their money in the stock market and received an average blended return of 5%, then their retirement portfolio would have been worth more than $1 million.", "timestamp": 1655173027, "digest": "tiH1eRLIZyDafIzi5ZLsXl2S12GpUxfy5J56IitzhL0", "contributor": "0x47A6871C8f80e124Ad08E4F1fD89524065ec8276"}
{"id": "-H_4cACq-QGXwAsr46zysVTQL5ubLYOeA0HOwk648ZE", "title": "KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)", "body": "## What Is the KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)?\n\nThe Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD) is the national currency of the State of Kuwait. The dinar name derives from the Roman denarius. The KWD subdivides into 1000 fils which is a coin used in many Arab countries.\n\nKuwait is a small nation located between Iraq and Saudi Arabia on the Persian Gulf. Its economy is heavily reliant on oil, making it one of the wealthiest nations in the world as measured by GDP per capita.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Kuwaiti dinar (KWD) is the currency of the State of Kuwait, and as of 2021 is the most valuable currency on Earth.\n* The currency fluctuates in a relatively small range and is pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies.\n* The economy of Kuwait is heavily reliant on oil, making it one of the wealthiest nations in the world.\n* Since its official release in 1961, the KWD has gone through six different versions.\n* As of December 2021, one Kuwaiti dinar is equal to approximately $3.3 U.S. dollars.\n\n## Understanding the KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)\n\nThe introduction of the Kuwaiti dinar (KWD) in 1961 was a replacement for the Gulf rupee. The Gulf rupee was a currency pegged [at parity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parityprice.asp) to the Indian rupee. Issued in 1959 by the Indian government, the Gulf rupee was for use outside of India, particularly in the Persian Gulf region. Like the Indian rupee, the Gulf rupee was pegged to the[ British pound sterling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gbp.asp) (GBP).2 \n\nIn 1961, Kuwait gained independence from the United Kingdom with the end of treaties put in place after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire. Kuwaiti Currency Law created the Kuwaiti Currency Board with the purpose of establishing a Kuwaiti currency. The Kuwaiti Currency Board introduced the Kuwaiti dinar as a replacement for the Gulf rupee. Until 1966, both currencies circulated, but the use of the rupee ended after its [devaluation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/devaluation.asp).34\n\nBetween 1975 and 2003, the Kuwaiti dinar was [pegged](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegging.asp) to a weighted currency basket. The content of the currency basket was mandated by the Kuwaiti Currency Board. In 2003, the KWD was pegged to the [U.S. dollar](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/u/usd-united-states-dollar.asp) (USD) at 0.29963 dinars to the dollar. This valuation continued until 2007 when it was formally re-pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies.56\n\nAs of December 2021, one Kuwaiti dinar is worth about USD 3.3, making it the most valuable money on Earth.7\n\nThe State of Kuwait has a petroleum product-based economy with 80% of government revenues coming from the [oil industry](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/oil-gas-industry-overview/). The State of Kuwait is a tax-free country, with one of the [lowest unemployment rates](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/062315/unemployment-rates-country.asp) in the world.8\n\nThe [Kuwait Investment Authority](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kia.asp) (KIA) is the oldest sovereign wealth fund in the world, and the investment industry of the country manages more assets than any other member of the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC), a regional economic and political union.\n\n## Issuance of the KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)\n\nThere have been six official issues of the Kuwaiti dinar banknotes since the first circulation in 1961. There have also been two commemorative sets circulated.9\n\nThe third series, released in 1980 upon the crowning of Emir Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, was in use until Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Upon invasion, the Iraqi government installed the Iraqi dinar as the official currency for the area.9\n\n### $132 Billion\n\n*The GDP of Kuwait in 2021, which is expected to increase to $138 billion in 2022.10*\n\nThe invading Iraqi forces stole an enormous number of Kuwaiti dinar banknotes. With the liberation of Kuwait, the invalidation of the third dinar issue forced the replacement with the fourth issue of the currency in 1991.9\n\nThe 1994 series implemented enhanced security features.9\n\nThe sixth series came in 2014 with bills specially textured so blind and vision-impaired persons can identify them by touch.9\n\n## KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar) Exchange Rate\n\nBetween December 2016 and December 2021, the Kuwaiti dinar fluctuated between $3.17 and $3.33. That means that it cost between $3.17 and $3.33 U.S. dollars to buy one Kuwaiti dinar. The higher [rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp), 3.33, means that the Kuwaiti dinar appreciated in value, or the U.S. dollar had fallen in value relative to the dinar. If the rate falls, that means that the Kuwaiti dinar is losing value, or that the U.S. dollar is gaining value relative to it.11\n\nDue to its relatively low volatility, and limited global trade, the Kuwaiti dinar is not typically used as a speculative trading instrument. If it were, a trader would attempt to buy near the lower end of its historical range, and try to sell near the top of it. Buying at $3.17 and selling at $3.33—the price range over five years—represents only a 5% profit, minus fees and commissions.\n\nThis is why most traders and investors stay away from trading this currency unless they feel a major [fundamental](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) shift may be forthcoming that could cause a major shift in the value of the currency.\n\n## How Is Kuwaiti Currency Pegged?\n\nThe Kuwaiti currency is pegged to a basket of currencies as opposed to one currency. The basket of currencies is not disclosed but is expected to be heavily weighted towards the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Why Is the KWD So Valuable?\n\nThe KWD is so valuable because the demand for the currency is very high. The economy of Kuwait is primarily dependent on oil, but not only that, it is a stable country that uses its oil revenue efficiently, unlike many oil-rich countries. In addition, it is a large exporter of oil. Because demand for global oil is high, the demand to pay for it in Kuwaiti currency is also high, making the KWD a very valuable currency.\n\n## Is Kuwait’s Currency More Valuable Than the U.S. Dollar?\n\nYes, Kuwait's currency is more valuable than the U.S. dollar because the demand for the KWD is high due to Kuwait being a large producer of oil. That being said, the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency and is accepted more widely.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "HWQwhHZl__icsTAUh54tlLCb5vplLzpVdaRTONvt1jU", "title": "Operating Margin", "body": "## What Is Operating Margin?\n\nThe operating margin measures how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales after paying for [variable costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variablecost.asp) of production, such as wages and raw materials, but before paying interest or tax. It is calculated by dividing a company’s operating income by its [net sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netsales.asp). Higher ratios are generally better, illustrating the company is efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits. \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The operating margin represents how efficiently a company is able to generate profit through its core operations.\n* It is expressed on a per-sale basis after accounting for variable costs but before paying any interest or taxes (EBIT).\n* Higher margins are considered better than lower margins, and can be compared between similar competitors but not across different industries.\n* To calculate the operating margin, divide operating income (earnings) by sales (revenues).\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 26 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:26\n\n#### Calculating Operating Margin\n\n## Understanding the Operating Margin\n\nA company’s operating margin, sometimes referred to as [return on sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ros.asp) (ROS), is a good indicator of how well it is being managed and how efficient it is at generating profits from sales. It shows the proportion of revenues that are available to cover non-operating costs, such as paying [interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp), which is why investors and lenders pay close attention to it.\n\nHighly variable operating margins are a prime indicator of business risk. By the same token, looking at a company’s past operating margins is a good way to gauge whether a company's performance has been getting better. The operating margin can improve through better management controls, more efficient use of resources, improved pricing, and more effective marketing.\n\nIn its essence, the operating margin is how much profit a company makes from its core business in relation to its total revenues. This allows investors to see if a company is generating income primarily from its core operations or from other means, such as investing.\n\n## Calculating the Operating Margin\n\nThe formula for operating margin is:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\text{Operating Margin}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Operating Earnings}}{\\\\text{Revenue}} \\\\end{aligned}Operating Margin=RevenueOperating Earnings​​﻿﻿\n\nWhen calculating operating margin, the numerator uses a firm's [earnings before interest and taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT). EBIT, or [operating earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingearnings.asp), is calculated simply as revenue minus [cost of goods sold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) (COGS) and the regular selling, general, and administrative costs of running a business, excluding interest and taxes.\n\n### Example\n\nFor example, if a company had revenues of $2 million, COGS of $700,000, and [administrative expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/administrative-expenses.asp) of $500,000, its operating earnings would be $2 million - ($700,000 + $500,000) = $800,000. Its operating margin would then be $800,000 / $2 million = 40%.\n\nIf the company was able to negotiate better prices with its suppliers, reducing its COGS to $500,000, then it would see an improvement in its operating margin to 50%.\n\n## Limitations of the Operating Margin\n\nThe operating margin should only be used to compare companies that operate in the same industry and, ideally, have similar [business models](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp) and annual sales. Companies in different industries with wildly different business models have very different operating margins, so comparing them would be meaningless. It would not be an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nTo make it easier to compare profitability between companies and industries, many analysts use a profitability ratio that eliminates the effects of financing, accounting, and tax policies: [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp) (EBITDA). For example, by adding back depreciation, the operating margins of big manufacturing firms and heavy industrial companies are more comparable.\n\nEBITDA is sometimes used as a proxy for [operating cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingcashflow.asp) because it excludes non-cash expenses, such as depreciation. However, EBITDA does not equal cash flow. This is because it does not adjust for any increase in [working capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) or account for capital expenditure that is needed to support production and maintain a company’s asset base—as operating cash flow does.\n\n## Other Profit Margins\n\nBy comparing EBIT to sales, operating profit margins show how successful a company's management has been at generating income from the operation of the business.  There are several other margin calculations that businesses and analysts can employ to get slightly different insights into a firm's profitability.\n\nThe [gross margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossmargin.asp) tells us how much profit a company makes on its cost of sales, or COGS. In other words, it indicates how efficiently management uses labor and supplies in the production process.\n\nThe [net margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net_margin.asp) considers the net profits generated from all segments of a business, accounting for all costs and accounting items incurred, including taxes and depreciation. In other words, this ratio compares [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) with sales. It comes as close as possible to summing up in a single figure how effectively the managers are running a business.\n\n## Why Is Operating Margin Important?\n\nThe operating margin is an important measure of a company's overall profitability from operations. It is the ratio of operating profits to revenues for a company or business segment.\n\nExpressed as a percentage, the operating margin shows how much earnings from operations is generated from every $1 in sales after accounting for the direct costs involved in earning those revenues. Larger margins mean that more of every dollar in sales is kept as profit.\n\n## How Can Companies Improve Their Net Profit Margin?\n\nWhen a company's operating margin exceeds the average for its industry, it is said to have a [competitive advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp), meaning it is more successful than other companies that have similar operations. While the average margin for different industries varies widely, businesses can gain a competitive advantage in general by [increasing sales or reducing expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/company-it-more-important-lower-costs-or-increase-revenue.asp)—or both.\n\nBoosting sales, however, often involves spending more money to do so, which equals greater costs. Cutting too many costs can also lead to undesirable outcomes, including losing skilled workers, shifting to inferior materials, or other losses in quality. Cutting advertising budgets may also harm sales.\n\nTo reduce the cost of production without sacrificing quality, the best option for many businesses is expansion. [Economies of scale](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-are-economies-of-scale/) refer to the idea that larger companies tend to be more profitable. A large business's increased level of production means that the cost of each item is reduced in several ways. For example, raw materials purchased in bulk are often discounted by wholesalers.\n\n## How Is Operating Margin Different From Other Profit Margin Measures?\n\nOperating margin takes into account all operating costs but excludes any non-operating costs. Net profit margin takes into account all costs involved in a sale, making it the most comprehensive and conservative measure of profitability. Gross margin, on the other hand, simply looks at the costs of goods sold (COGS) and ignores things such as [overhead](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overhead.asp), fixed costs, interest expenses, and taxes.\n\n## What Are Some High and Low Profit Margin Industries?\n\nHigh operating margin sectors typically include those in the services industry, as there are fewer assets involved in the production than an assembly line. Similarly, software or gaming companies may invest initially while developing a particular software/game and cash in big later by simply selling millions of copies with very little expense. Meanwhile, luxury goods and high-end accessories often operate on high-profit potential and low sales.\n\nOperations-intensive businesses such as transportation, which may have to deal with fluctuating fuel prices, drivers’ perks and retention, and vehicle maintenance, usually have lower operating margins. Agriculture-based ventures, too, usually have lower margins owing to weather uncertainty, high inventory, operational overheads, need for farming and storage space, and resource-intensive activities.\n\nAutomobiles also have low margins, as profits and sales are limited by intense competition, uncertain consumer demand, and high operational expenses involved in developing dealership networks and logistics.", "timestamp": 1655172921, "digest": "daj_I0A30k1YPo5eRiAosJi5igCDyBN_KujTscPP9VM", "contributor": "0xA42726cEebb2a86481E84CFD8F7cd4c5C90c88F6"}
{"id": "Mu2OOFk86hE_4Xa0foINHF3EuQkWPWMf3IYsyVRw9yQ", "title": "The Kyoto Protocol", "body": "## What Is the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement that aimed to reduce [carbon dioxide](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092915/5-countries-produce-most-carbon-dioxide-co2.asp) (CO2) emissions and the presence of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. The essential tenet of the Kyoto Protocol was that industrialized nations needed to lessen the amount of their CO2 emissions.1\n\nThe protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan in 1997, when greenhouse gases were rapidly threatening our climate, life on the earth, and the planet.1 Today, the Kyoto Protocol lives on in other forms, and its issues are still being discussed.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement that called for industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions significantly.\n* Other accords, like the Doha Amendment and the Paris Climate Agreement, have also tried to curb the global-warming crisis.\n* Talks begun by the Kyoto Protocol continue in 2021 and are extremely complicated, involving politics, money, and lack of consensus.\n* The U.S. withdrew from the agreement on the grounds that the mandate was unfair and would hurt the U.S. economy.\n* The Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, which replaced the Kyoto Protocol, includes commitments from all major GHG-emitting countries to reduce their climate-altering pollution.\n\n## The Kyoto Protocol Explained\n\n### Background\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol mandated that industrialized nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions at a time when the threat of global warming was growing rapidly. The Protocol was linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It was adopted in Kyoto, Japan on December 11, 1997, and became international law on February 16, 2005.1﻿\n\nCountries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol were assigned maximum carbon emission levels for specific periods and participated in [carbon credit trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbontrade.asp). If a country emitted more than its assigned limit, then it would be penalized by receiving a lower emissions limit in the following period.\n\n### Major Tenets\n\nDeveloped, industrialized countries made a promise under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their annual [hydrocarbon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hydrocarbon.asp) emissions by an average of 5.2% by the year 2012. This number would represent about 29% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTargets depended on the individual country. As a result, each nation had a different target to meet by that year.\n\nMembers of the [European Union](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-community.asp) (EU) pledged to cut emissions by 8%, while the U.S. and Canada promised to reduce their emissions by 7% and 6%, respectively, by 2012.2\n\n### $100 billion\n\n*The amount of the Kyoto Protocol fund that was meant to aid developing countries in selecting non-greenhouse-emitting industrialized processes and technologies.3*\n\n### Responsibilities of Developed Versus Developing Nations\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol recognized that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of [GHG emissions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/030816/top-4-oil-companies-protect-environment-xom-sun.asp) in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity. As such, the protocol placed a heavier burden on developed nations than less-developed nations.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol mandated that 37 industrialized nations plus the EU cut their GHG emissions. Developing nations were asked to comply voluntarily, and more than 100 developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from the Kyoto agreement altogether.\n\n### A Particular Function for Developing Countries\n\nThe protocol separated countries into two groups: Annex I contained developed nations, and Non-Annex I referred to developing countries. The protocol placed emission limitations on Annex I countries only. Non-Annex I nations participated by investing in projects designed to lower emissions in their countries.\n\nFor these projects, developing countries earned [carbon credits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbon_credit.asp), which they could trade or sell to developed countries, allowing the developed nations a higher level of maximum carbon emissions for that period. In effect, this function helped the developed countries to continue emitting GHG vigorously.\n\n### The United States' Involvement\n\nThe United States, which had ratified the original Kyoto agreement, dropped out of the protocol in 2001. The U.S. believed that the agreement was unfair because it called only for industrialized nations to limit emissions reductions, and it felt that doing so would hurt the U.S. economy.4\n\n## The Kyoto Protocol Ended in 2012, Effectively Half-Baked\n\nGlobal emissions were still on the rise by 2005, the year the Kyoto Protocol became international law—even though it was adopted in 1997. Things seemed to go well for many countries, including those in the EU. They planned to meet or exceed their targets under the agreement by 2011. But others continued to fall short.\n\nThe United States and China—two of the world's biggest emitters—produced enough greenhouse gases to mitigate any of the progress made by nations who met their targets. In fact, there was an increase of about 40% in emissions globally between 1990 and 2009.\n\n### The Doha Amendment Extended Kyoto Protocol to 2020\n\nIn December 2012, after the first commitment period of the Protocol ended, parties to the Kyoto Protocol met in Doha, Qatar, to adopt an amendment to the original Kyoto agreement. This so-called Doha Amendment added new emission-reduction targets for the second commitment period, 2012–2020, for participating countries.5\n\nThe Doha Amendment had a short life. In 2015, at the sustainable development summit held in Paris, all UNFCCC participants signed yet another pact, the [Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paris-agreementcop21.asp), which effectively replaced the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n### The Paris Climate Agreement\n\nThe Paris Climate Agreement is a landmark environmental pact that was adopted by nearly every nation in 2015 to [address climate change](https://www.investopedia.com/biden-s-plan-for-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2050-5208175) and its negative effects. The agreement includes commitments from all major GHG-emitting countries to cut their climate-altering pollution and to strengthen those commitments over time.6\n\n### \n\n*Every five years, countries engage in the Global Stocktake, which is an assessment of their progress under the Paris Climate Agreement.*\n\nA major directive of the deal calls for reducing global GHG emissions to limit the earth's temperature increase in this century to 2 degrees (preferring a 1.5-degree increase) Celsius above preindustrial levels. The Paris Agreement also provides a way for developed nations to assist developing nations in their efforts to adapt climate control, and it creates a framework for monitoring and reporting countries’ climate goals [transparently](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transparency.asp).7\n\n## The Kyoto Protocol Today\n\nIn 2016, when the Paris Climate Agreement went into force, the United States was one of the principal drivers of the agreement, and President Obama hailed it as “a tribute to American leadership.”8\n\nAs a candidate for president at that time, Donald Trump criticized the agreement as a bad deal for the American people and pledged to withdraw the United States if elected. In 2017, then-President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, saying that it would undermine the U.S. economy.\n\nThe former president did not begin the formal withdrawal process until Nov. 4, 2019.9 The U.S. formally withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the 2020 presidential election, in which Donald Trump lost his reelection bid to Joseph Biden.10\n\nOn January 20, 2021, his first day in office, President Biden began the process of rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, which officially took effect on Feb. 19, 2021.11\n\n### A Complicated Stalemate\n\nIn 2021, the dialogue is still alive but has turned into a complex quagmire involving politics, money, lack of leadership, lack of consensus, and bureaucracy. Today, despite myriad plans and some actions, solutions to the problems of GHG emissions and global warming have not been implemented.\n\nAlmost all scientists who study the atmosphere now believe that global warming is primarily the result of human action. Logically then, what humans have caused by their behavior should be able to be remedied by humans changing their behavior. It is frustrating to many that cohesive action to deal with the human-made global climate crisis has yet to happen.\n\n### Remember the Internet\n\nIt is critical that we remain convinced that we can, in fact, resolve these issues so crucial to our survival. We humans have already solved huge problems in numerous fields via technical innovation that led to radically new solutions.\n\nInterestingly, if anyone had suggested in 1958 that our own Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which oversees the development of advanced technologies for use by the U.S. military, would lead the world in creating the Internet—a system that could \"connect every person and thing with every other person and thing on the planet instantly and at zero cost\"—they might have been laughed off the stage, or worse.\n\n## What Is the Primary Purpose of the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was an agreement among developed nations to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and greenhouse gases (GHG).\n\n## Why Didn’t the U.S. Sign the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nThe United States backed out of the Kyoto Protocol agreement in 2001 on the basis that it unfairly burdened developed nations. The treaty called only for developed nations to reduce emissions, which the U.S. believed would unfairly stifle its economy.12\n\n## What Special Problems Do Developing Nations Face With Such Treaties As the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nDeveloping countries were not mandated to act under the agreement, and volunteering to reduce emissions under it would create large costs that they were either incapable of incurring or unwilling to incur.\n\n## What Sorts of Emissions Is the Kyoto Protocol Built to Curb?\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was built to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "9d5SqKN1OygZeeHf-g005MRF8yezPBrHj-_q67bEW9Q", "title": "Laissez-Faire", "body": "## What Is Laissez-Faire?\n\nLaissez-faire is an economic theory from the 18th century that opposed any government intervention in business affairs. The driving principle behind laissez-faire, a French term that translates to \"leave alone\" (literally, \"let you do\"), is that the less the government is involved in the economy, the better off business will be, and by extension, society as a whole. Laissez-faire economics is a key part of [free-market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp) capitalism.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Laissez-faire is an economic philosophy of free-market capitalism that opposes government intervention.\n* The theory of laissez-faire was developed by the French Physiocrats during the 18th century and believes that economic success is more likely the less governments are involved in business.\n* Later free-market economists built on the ideas of laissez-faire as a path to economic prosperity, though detractors have criticized it for promoting inequality.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 14 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:14\n\n#### Laissez Faire\n\n## Understanding Laissez-Faire\n\nThe underlying beliefs that make up the fundamentals of laissez-faire economics include the idea that economic competition constitutes a \"natural order\" that rules the world. Because this natural self-regulation is the best type of regulation, laissez-faire [economists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp) argue that there is no need for business and industrial affairs to be complicated by government intervention.\n\nAs a result, they oppose any sort of federal involvement in the economy, which includes any type of legislation or oversight; they are against [minimum wages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp), duties, trade restrictions, and [corporate taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatetax.asp). In fact, laissez-faire economists see such taxes as a penalty for production.\n\n## History of Laissez-Faire\n\nPopularized in the mid-1700s, the doctrine of laissez-faire is one of the first articulated economic theories. It originated with a group known as the Physiocrats, who flourished in France from about 1756 to 1778.1\n\nLed by a physician, they tried to apply scientific principles and methodology to the study of wealth. These \"économistes\" (as they dubbed themselves) argued that a free market and free economic [competition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfectcompetition.asp) were extremely important to the health of a free society.2 The government should only intervene in the economy to preserve property, life, and individual freedom; otherwise, the natural, unchanging laws that govern market forces and economic processes—what later British economist [Adam Smith](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-economics/), dubbed the \"[invisible hand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp)\"—should be allowed to proceed unhindered.\n\nLegend has it that the origins of the phrase \"laissez-faire\" in an economic context came from a 1681 meeting between the French finance minister Jean-Baptise Colbert and a businessman named Le Gendre. As the story goes, Colbert asked Le Gendre how best the government could help commerce, to which Le Gendre replied \"*Laissez-nous faire*;\" basically, \"Let it be.\" The Physiocrats popularized the phrase, using it to name their core economic doctrine.3\n\nUnfortunately, an early effort to test laissez-faire theories did not go well. As an experiment in 1774, Turgot, Louis XVI's Controller-General of Finances, abolished all restraints on the heavily controlled grain industry, allowing imports and exports between provinces to operate as a free trade system.\n\nBut when poor harvests caused scarcities, prices shot through the roof; merchants ended up hoarding supplies or selling grain in strategic areas, even outside the country for better profit, while thousands of French citizens starved. Riots ensued for several months. In the middle of 1775, the order was restored, and with it, government controls over the grain market.4\n\nDespite this inauspicious start, laissez-faire practices, developed further by such British economists as Smith and [David Ricardo](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/david-ricardo.asp), ruled during the [Industrial Revolution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-revolution.asp) of the late 18th and early 19th century. And, as its detractors noted, it did result in unsafe working conditions and large wealth gaps.\n\nOnly at the beginning of the 20th century did developed industrialized nations like the U.S. begin to implement significant government controls and regulations to protect workers from hazardous conditions and consumers from unfair business practices; though it’s important to note that these policies were not intended to restrict business practices and competition.\n\n## Criticism of Laissez-Faire\n\nOne of the chief criticisms of laissez-faire is that capitalism as a system has moral ambiguities built into it: It does not inherently protect the weakest in society. While laissez-faire advocates argue that if individuals serve their own interests first, societal benefits will follow.\n\nDetractors feel laissez-faire actually leads to poverty and economic imbalances. The idea of letting an economic system run without regulation or correction in effect dismisses or further victimizes those most in need of assistance, they say.\n\nThe 20th-century British economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) was a prominent critic of laissez-faire economics, and he argued that the question of market solution versus government intervention needed to be decided on a case-by-case basis.5\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstPMZTf8qhZOO0BNoBo1U3end21M6FU-yO2hR57gj2_LgdO7YRMx4Qy49oEghlTucIU-NZD-_Koy-xWsOk-6ThQzQQaXIcVv1LyIRxQiykfFGft7dJ2WMUZ8WDjG9zp7qA8pdsZnCBJF7B0JfJ49rBydTPlZ0y9ijZfPlvn69lD0rI6ZwnmxvsfLu6L0z_nsSLNdHvk5yTpt94V1vDuoxdUWQf1wo26N6PGsjw04TmSNs9Aa8HTcSUYgWauwRE1Wis4O2rCn9CHfgn7BLfvWPZJFqsLo2k_e4jiALjnhYrYuRikCbcc3qbwoGhiqiRV28ecuvC3YdzSX-F90SSRP2pSSWc&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKBNF0YFNewVEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstPMZTf8qhZOO0BNoBo1U3end21M6FU-yO2hR57gj2_LgdO7YRMx4Qy49oEghlTucIU-NZD-_Koy-xWsOk-6ThQzQQaXIcVv1LyIRxQiykfFGft7dJ2WMUZ8WDjG9zp7qA8pdsZnCBJF7B0JfJ49rBydTPlZ0y9ijZfPlvn69lD0rI6ZwnmxvsfLu6L0z_nsSLNdHvk5yTpt94V1vDuoxdUWQf1wo26N6PGsjw04TmSNs9Aa8HTcSUYgWauwRE1Wis4O2rCn9CHfgn7BLfvWPZJFqsLo2k_e4jiALjnhYrYuRikCbcc3qbwoGhiqiRV28ecuvC3YdzSX-F90SSRP2pSSWc&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKBNF0YFNewVEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "DREkL4Da7wicD8y03dfKQNWdJ7cqPMB-OQTxgJYbCpM", "title": "Organizational Structure", "body": "## What Is an Organizational Structure?\n\nAn organizational structure is a system that outlines how certain activities are directed in order to achieve the goals of an organization. These activities can include rules, roles, and responsibilities.\n\nThe organizational structure also determines how information flows between levels within the company. For example, in a centralized structure, decisions flow from the top down, while in a decentralized structure, decision-making power is distributed among various levels of the organization.\n\nHaving an organizational structure in place allows companies to remain efficient and focused.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* An organizational structure outlines how certain activities are directed to achieve the goals of an organization.\n* Successful organizational structures define each employee's job and how it fits within the overall system.\n* A centralized structure has a defined chain of command, while decentralized structures give almost every employee receiving a high level of personal agency.\n* Types of organizational structures include functional, divisional, flatarchy, and matrix structures. \n* Senior leaders should consider a variety of factors before deciding which type of organization is best for their business, including the business goals, industry, and culture of the company.\n\n## Understanding an Organizational Structure\n\nBusinesses of all shapes and sizes use organizational structures heavily. They define a specific [hierarchy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-hierarchy.asp) within an organization. A successful organizational structure defines each employee's job and how it fits within the overall system. Put simply, the organizational structure lays out who does what so the company can meet its objectives.\n\nThis structuring provides a company with a visual representation of how it is shaped and how it can best move forward in achieving its goals. Organizational structures are normally illustrated in some sort of chart or diagram like a pyramid, where the most powerful members of the organization sit at the top, while those with the least amount of power are at the bottom.\n\nNot having a formal structure in place may prove difficult for certain organizations. For instance, employees may have difficulty knowing to whom they should report. That can lead to uncertainty as to who is responsible for what in the organization.\n\nHaving a structure in place can help with [efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficiency.asp) and provide clarity for everyone at every level. That also means each and every department can be more productive, as they are likely to be more focused on energy and time.\n\n## Centralized vs. Decentralized Organizational Structures\n\nAn organizational structure is either centralized or decentralized. Traditionally, organizations have been structured with centralized leadership and a defined chain of command. The military is an organization famous for its highly centralized structure, with a long and specific hierarchy of superiors and subordinates. In a centralized organizational system, there are very clear responsibilities for each role, with subordinate roles defaulting to the guidance of their superiors.\n\nThere has been a rise in decentralized organizations, as is the case with many technology [startups](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp). This allows companies to remain fast, agile, and adaptable, with almost every employee receiving a high level of personal agency. For example, Johnson & Johnson is a company that's known for its decentralized structure.2 As a large company with over 200 business units and brands that function in sometimes very different industries, each operates autonomously. Even in decentralized companies, there are still usually built-in hierarchies (such as the chief operating officer operating at a higher level than an entry-level associate). However, teams are empowered to make their own decisions and come to the best conclusion without necessarily getting \"approval\" from up top.\n\n## Types of Organizational Structures\n\n### Functional Structure\n\nFour types of common organizational structures are implemented in the real world. The first and most common is a functional structure. This is also referred to as a [bureaucratic organizational structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bureaucracy.asp) and breaks up a company based on the specialization of its workforce. Most small-to-medium-sized businesses implement a functional structure. Dividing the firm into departments consisting of marketing, sales, and operations is the act of using a bureaucratic organizational structure.\n\n### Divisional or Multidivisional Structure\n\nThe second type is common among large companies with many business units. Called the divisional or multidivisional structure, a company that uses this method structures its leadership team based on the products, projects, or subsidiaries they operate. A good example of this structure is Johnson & Johnson. With thousands of products and lines of business, the company structures itself so each business unit operates as its own company with its own president.\n\n### Flatarchy Structure\n\nFlatarchy, a newer structure, is the third type and is used among many startups. As the name alludes, it flattens the hierarchy and chain of command and gives its employees a lot of autonomy. Companies that use this type of structure have a high speed of implementation.\n\n### Matrix Structure\n\nThe fourth and final organizational structure is a matrix structure. It is also the most confusing and the least used. This structure matrixes employees across different superiors, divisions, or departments. An employee working for a matrixed company, for example, may have duties in both sales and [customer service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp).\n\n## Benefits of Organizational Structures\n\nPutting an organizational structure in place can be very beneficial to a company. The structure not only defines a company's hierarchy but also allows the firm to layout the pay structure for its employees. By putting the organizational structure in place, the firm can decide salary grades and ranges for each position.\n\nThe structure also makes operations more efficient and much more effective. By separating employees and functions into different departments, the company can perform different operations at once seamlessly.\n\nIn addition, a very clear organizational structure informs employees how best to get their jobs done. For example, in a hierarchical organization, employees will have to work harder at buying favor or courting those with decision-making power. In a decentralized organization, employees must take on more initiative and bring creative problem solving to the table. This can also help set expectations for how employees can track their own growth within a company and emphasize a certain set of skills—as well as for potential employees to gauge if such a company would be a good fit with their own interests and work styles.\n\n## What Are the Four Types of Organizational Structures?\n\nThe four types of organizational structures are functional, divisional, flatarchy, and matrix structures. \n\n## What Are the Key Elements of an Organizational Structure?\n\nKey elements of an organizational structure include how certain activities are directed in order to achieve the goals of an organization, such as rules, roles, responsibilities, and how information flows between levels within the company.\n\n## What Is an Organizational Structure Example?\n\nAn example of an organizational structure is a decentralized structure, which gives individuals and teams high degrees of autonomy without needing a core team to regularly approve business decisions. A good example of this decentralized structure is Johnson & Johnson. With thousands of products and lines of business, the company structures itself so each business unit operates as its own company with its own president.\n\n## What Is an Organizational Structure Chart?\n\nOrganizational structures are normally illustrated in some sort of chart or diagram like a pyramid, where the most powerful members of the organization sit at the top, while those with the least amount of power are at the bottom.\n\n## What Is the Best Organizational Structure?\n\nThere is no one best organizational structure, as it depends on the nature of the company and the industry it operates in.", "timestamp": 1655173186, "digest": "_D0s_JGMUcgW6v2YM2TqV2LhuQY85v2eLtX-oSw-ccc", "contributor": "0x23Ef48bb2d0F3B2139572AC1Ea1ba26BCc64dF3a"}

{"id": "AMuX27qqy0BvQL66sFVdTwdjpjggGCC9Yf5odSN_yT4", "title": "Original Issue Discount (OID)", "body": "## What Is an Original Issue Discount (OID)?\n\nAn original issue discount (OID) is the discount in price from a bond's [face value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp) at the time a [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) or other debt instrument is first issued. Bonds can be issued at a price lower than their face value—known as a [discount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-discount.asp). The OID is the amount of discount or the difference between the original face value and the price paid for the bond.\n\nOriginal issue discounts are used by bond issuers to attract buyers to purchase their bonds so that the issuers can raise funds for their business. Many [zero-coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp) use large OIDs to entice buyers to their products.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The original issue discount (OID) is the difference between the original face value amount and the discounted price paid for a bond.\n* OID bonds have the potential for gains since investors can buy the bonds for a lower price than their face value.\n* OID bonds sold at a discount could indicate an issuer is facing financial difficulty and default is possible.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 2 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:02\n\n#### Original Issue Discount\n\n## How an Original Issue Discount (OID) Works\n\nOnce purchased, the bond's issuer usually pays the bondholder an interest rate—called a [coupon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp)—while the investor holds the bond. Periodically, the bondholder receives interest payments based on the rate of the bond. When the bond reaches [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), the investor gets the return of the face value paid for the bond.\n\nHowever, some bonds sell for a price less than the face or par value of the note. The OID is the difference between the price paid for a bond and its face value. The OID may be considered interest since the buyer is paid the face value of the bond at maturity even though the purchase price was lower than the face value.\n\nFor example, let's say that a bond has a $100 face value, meaning the investor would receive $100 returned at the maturity date. If the investor buys the bond for $95 and receives $100 at maturity, the OID is $5, which is the return on the investment.\n\nAs opposed to traditional bonds, the gain from the OID is only realized at maturity when the investor receives the return of the face value principal. In other words, the OID is paid as a total sum at maturity, along with the original amount invested.\n\n## OIDs and Interest Rates\n\nA company can have a bond that sells [at a discount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-discount.asp) to its face value while it also pays periodic interest. However, the amount of OID tends to correlate with the interest rate on the bond inversely. In other words, the bigger the discount, the lower the coupon rate offered on the bond.\n\nThe reason for the negative correlation is that companies might issue a bond at a discount to its face value, so the company does not have to pay a regular, and ongoing higher interest rate to investors. Although interest earned on a bond is income for investors, it's an expense for companies.\n\nConversely, the higher the rate on a bond, the less it is likely to sell at a discount, and its OID, if any, would be smaller. If a bond's rate is attractive to investors, there will likely be many buyers and demand for the bond, so it's not likely it will sell for much of a discount.\n\nInvestors should understand that just because they are buying a bond at a discount, it does not mean it is a bargain. The return received for the OID may end up being less than the interest rate offered on a traditional [fixed-rate bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp). Comparison is important as the original issue discount plus the total of regular coupon payments must be higher than alternative fixed-rate products to make it a bargain.\n\n## Original Issue Discounts and Zero-Coupon Bonds\n\nThe bonds with the highest original issue discounts are typically [zero-coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp). As the name indicates, these debt instruments do not pay a coupon interest payment. Without this to entice buyers, they must offer deeper discounts as compared to bonds that pay interest and sell at their face values. The only way for investors to earn income from a zero-coupon bond is from the difference between the bond's purchase price, and its face value at maturity.\n\nZero-coupon bonds save the costs of interest payments for the issuer at the expense of the lower initial selling price. Once the bonds mature, they are redeemed for full face value.\n\nSince they don't pay a coupon, zero-coupon bonds are not affected by interest rate fluctuations. Typically, if interest rates rise significantly, existing fixed-rate bonds become less attractive, and their prices fall as investors sell them for higher-rate bonds elsewhere. Conversely, if interest rates fall significantly, existing fixed-rate bonds become more attractive, and their prices rise as investors rush to buy them.\n\nWithout the impact of changes to the [market interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market-rate.asp), some consider these investments low-risk. However, zero-coupon bonds are generally not as liquid, so there will be limited buyers and sellers on the secondary [bond market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp).\n\n## Original Issue Discounts and Default Risk\n\nJust like you need to examine a sweater selling for a discount for flaws, the same care must be taken with OID bonds. One that is offering a large OID might be selling at a discount because the bond issuer is in financial distress. Also, a bond selling at a discount might mean there's a lack of investors willing to buy it for some reason. There may be an expectation the company might [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on the bond. A default is when an issuer can no longer make interest payments or repay the principal amount that bondholders had initially invested.\n\nIf corporate bonds default, investors have little recourse. Although bondholders are paid before common stockholders in the event of a company's [bankruptcy,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) there is no guarantee that the investor will receive the return of the full amount of their investment, if anything at all.\n\nAlthough investors are compensated somewhat for their risk by being able to buy the bond at a discounted price, they should weigh the risks versus the rewards carefully.\n\nPros\n\n* Investors pay less than the par value for an OID bond.\n* Zero-coupon bonds use large OIDs to entice investors.\n* OID bonds are less affected by fluctuations in interest rates.\n\nCons\n\n* Discounted bonds can indicate an issuer is facing financial difficulty.\n* The OID may not offset rates offered by traditional fixed-rate bonds.\n* Investors could face an annual tax liability before the bond matures.\n\n## Original Issue Discounts and Tax Liability\n\nIt's important for investors to contact a tax professional or review the [IRS tax code](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-code.asp) before investing in bonds that are considered original issue discounts. It is probable that the difference between the discounted purchase price and the face value is taxable. However, investors may need to declare a portion of the income earned each year they hold the bond even though they have not received the face value amount at maturity.\n\n## Real World Example of an Original Issue Discount\n\nAs an example, in 2019, KushCo Holdings Inc. (KSHB) sold or floated a senior unsecured note for over $21.3 million. This 18-month note was issued as an original issue discount as stated by the company in its press release: \"The Note is being issued at an original issue discount and will not bear additional interest.\"", "timestamp": 1655173418, "digest": "p8mR1sn5e4RAw4BiKB7T0IvHXnpmL6cmu1YrJmK8LVo", "contributor": "0x7A74d8b2640b9daF687553f4Ec6F56aBAbE10828"}
{"id": "ApUhrAyOyfeSeT13zq4h1d4Y3HWCd__gMNItdFwrrHQ", "title": "Law of Demand", "body": "## What Is the Law of Demand?\n\nThe law of demand is one of the most fundamental concepts in economics. It works with the [law of supply](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofsupply.asp) to explain how market economies allocate resources and determine the prices of goods and services that we observe in everyday transactions.\n\nThe law of demand states that the quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. This occurs because of [diminishing marginal utility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp). That is, consumers use the first units of an economic good they purchase to serve their most urgent needs first, and then they use each additional unit of the good to serve successively lower-valued ends.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The law of demand is a fundamental principle of economics that states that at a higher price consumers will demand a lower quantity of a good.\n* Demand is derived from the law of diminishing marginal utility, the fact that consumers use economic goods to satisfy their most urgent needs first.\n* A market demand curve expresses the sum of quantity demanded at each price across all consumers in the market.\n* Changes in price can be reflected in movement along a demand curve, but do not by themselves increase or decrease demand.\n* The shape and magnitude of demand shifts in response to changes in consumer preferences, incomes, or related economic goods, NOT to changes in price.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 47 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:47\n\n#### Law of Demand\n\n## Understanding the Law of Demand\n\n[Economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economics.asp) involves the study of how people use limited means to satisfy unlimited wants. The law of demand focuses on those unlimited wants. Naturally, people prioritize more urgent wants and needs over less urgent ones in their economic behavior, and this carries over into how people choose among the limited means available to them. For any economic good, the first unit of that good that a consumer gets their hands on will tend to be put to use to satisfy the most urgent need the consumer has that that good can satisfy.\n\nFor example, consider a castaway on a desert island that obtains a six-pack of bottled, freshwater washed up onshore. The first bottle will be used to satisfy the castaway's most urgently felt need, most likely drinking water to avoid dying of thirst. The second bottle might be used for bathing to stave off disease, an urgent but less immediate need. The third bottle could be used for a less urgent need such as boiling some fish to have a hot meal, and on down to the last bottle, which the castaway uses for a relatively low priority like watering a small potted plant to keep him company on the island.\n\nIn our example, because each additional bottle of water is used for a successively less highly valued want or need by our castaway, we can say that the castaway values each additional bottle less than the one before. Similarly, when consumers purchase goods on the market each additional unit of any given good or service that they buy will be put to a less valued use than the one before, so we can say that they value each additional unit less and less. Because they value each additional unit of the good less, they are willing to pay less for it. So the more units of a good consumers buy, the less they are willing to pay in terms of the price.\n\nBy adding up all the units of a good that consumers are willing to buy at any given price we can describe a market [demand curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand-curve.asp), which is always downward-sloping, like the one shown in the chart below. Each point on the curve (A, B, C) reflects the quantity demanded (Q) at a given price (P). At point A, for example, the quantity demanded is low (Q1) and the price is high (P1). At higher prices, consumers demand less of the good, and at lower prices, they demand more.\n\nImage by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 \n\n## Demand vs. Quantity Demanded\n\nIn economic thinking, it is important to understand the difference between the phenomenon of demand and the quantity demanded. In the chart, the term \"demand\" refers to the green line plotted through A, B, and C. It expresses the relationship between the urgency of consumer wants and the number of units of the economic good at hand. A change in demand means a shift of the position or shape of this curve; it reflects a change in the underlying pattern of consumer wants and needs vis-a-vis the means available to satisfy them.\n\nOn the other hand, the term \"quantity demanded\" refers to a point along the horizontal axis. Changes in the quantity demanded strictly reflect changes in the price, without implying any change in the pattern of consumer preferences. Changes in quantity demanded just mean movement along the demand curve itself because of a change in price. These two ideas are often conflated, but this is a common error; rising (or falling) prices do not decrease (or increase) demand, they change the quantity demanded.\n\n## Factors Affecting Demand\n\nSo what does change demand? The shape and position of the demand curve can be impacted by several factors. Rising incomes tend to increase demand for normal economic goods, as people are willing to spend more. The availability of close substitute products that compete with a given economic good will tend to reduce demand for that good, since they can satisfy the same kinds of consumer wants and needs. Conversely, the availability of closely complementary goods will tend to increase demand for an economic good, because the use of two goods together can be even more valuable to consumers than using them separately, like peanut butter and jelly.\n\nOther factors such as future expectations, changes in background environmental conditions, or changes in the actual or perceived quality of a good can change the demand curve because they alter the pattern of consumer preferences for how the good can be used and how urgently it is needed.\n\n## What Is a Simple Explanation of the Law of Demand?\n\nThe Law of Demand tells us that if more people want to buy something, given a limited supply, the price of that thing will be bid higher. Likewise, the higher the price of a good, the lower the quantity that will be purchased by consumers.\n\n## Why Is the Law of Demand Important?\n\nTogether with the Law of Supply, the Law of Demand helps us understand why things are priced at the level that they are, and to identify opportunities to buy what are perceived to be underpriced (or sell overpriced) products, assets, or securities. For instance, a firm may boost production in response to rising prices that have been spurred by a surge in demand.\n\n## Can the Law of Demand Be Broken?\n\nYes, in certain cases an increase in demand does not affect prices in ways predicted by the Law of Demand. For instance, so-called [Veblen goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp) are things whose demand increases as their price rises, as these are perceived as status symbols. Similarly, demand for [Giffen goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/giffen-good.asp) (which in contrast to Veblen goods are not luxury items) rises when the price rises and falls when the price falls. Examples of Giffen goods can include bread, rice, and wheat. These tend to be common necessities and essential items with few good substitutes at the same price levels. Thus, people may start to hoard toilet paper even as its price goes up.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvEgmj9SX040DDdM0xSTRs3H1rEUk2vi8pjz6fXQlvYd0kJIIhSYQ3qWv60A3vh75Q6ZF8vZe4LfI7N8Nx_9KFAoKv219P5xEpGkAFuwMBqoIYJH9kCGRpxzp7NkaegfqUVT1fZcs2OLS18CNJCqfpXAVpfb3ZwijrJYWBCqJzJJIUyDvHzwJTaeqzLTmMf899ExGXBSt6uW5y89BO0hnxQBXLKnCMKDIure0PbcsilFSDJTi5clSwD_eiLGNIPGowKwolaLLlKNGkmMtRUzk_b0Kn89EkH5AEtPxdA2-clNMoJmWhnqbeiXok9v2vIK45Nbzi_Jt9eF92V5HRnobM1tzk&sig=Cg0ArKJSzCy-o6PuqqReEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvEgmj9SX040DDdM0xSTRs3H1rEUk2vi8pjz6fXQlvYd0kJIIhSYQ3qWv60A3vh75Q6ZF8vZe4LfI7N8Nx_9KFAoKv219P5xEpGkAFuwMBqoIYJH9kCGRpxzp7NkaegfqUVT1fZcs2OLS18CNJCqfpXAVpfb3ZwijrJYWBCqJzJJIUyDvHzwJTaeqzLTmMf899ExGXBSt6uW5y89BO0hnxQBXLKnCMKDIure0PbcsilFSDJTi5clSwD_eiLGNIPGowKwolaLLlKNGkmMtRUzk_b0Kn89EkH5AEtPxdA2-clNMoJmWhnqbeiXok9v2vIK45Nbzi_Jt9eF92V5HRnobM1tzk&sig=Cg0ArKJSzCy-o6PuqqReEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "f56pNXqa2DTPnMTNZ__2xM9gjW0hvdP0cQ5jfIkfovs", "title": "Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)", "body": "## What Is an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)?\n\nAn original equipment manufacturer (OEM) traditionally is defined as a company whose goods are used as components in the products of another company, which then sells the finished item to users.\n\nThe second firm is referred to as a [value-added reseller](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value-added-reseller.asp) (VAR) because by augmenting or incorporating features or services, it adds value to the original item. The VAR works closely with the OEM, which often customizes designs based on the VAR company's needs and specifications.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 21 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:21\n\n#### Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) provides the components in another company's product, working closely with the seller of the finished product, known as the value-added reseller (VAR).\n* In the computer industry, OEM may refer to the company that buys products and then incorporates or rebrands them into a new product under its own name.\n* Traditionally, OEMs focused on business-to-business sales, while VARs marketed to the public or other end users.\n* OEMs stand in contrast to aftermarket products, which offer replacement parts that are generic and cheaper than an OEM's parts.\n\n## Understanding an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)\n\nVARs and OEMs work together. OEMs make sub-assembly parts to sell to VARs. Although some OEMs do make complete items for a VAR to market, they usually don't play much of a direct role in determining the finished product.\n\nA common example might be the relationship between an OEM of individual electronic components and a company such as Sony or Samsung that assembles those parts in making their HDTVs. Or a maker of buttons that sells to Ralph Lauren its little fasteners customized with the letters RL stamped on them. Typically, no one integrated part from an OEM is recognized as playing an especially significant role in the finished product, which goes out under the corporate [brand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand.asp) name.\n\nTraditionally, OEMs focused on [business-to-business](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp) sales, while VARs marketed to the public or other end users. As of 2021, an increasing number of OEMs are selling their parts or services directly to consumers (which, in a way, makes them a VAR).\n\nFor example, people who build their own computers can buy graphics cards or processors directly from Nvidia, Intel, or retailers that stock those products. Similarly, if a person wants to do their own car repairs, they can often buy OEM parts directly from the manufacturer or a retailer who stocks those parts.\n\nOne of the most basic examples of an OEM is the relationship between an auto manufacturer and a maker of auto parts. Parts such as exhaust systems or brake cylinders are manufactured by a wide variety of OEMs. The OEM parts are then sold to an auto manufacturer, which then assembles them into a car. The completed car is then marketed to auto dealers to be sold to individual consumers.\n\nThere is a second, newer definition of OEM, typically used in the computer industry. In this case, OEM may refer to the company that buys products and then incorporates or rebrands them into a new product under its own name.\n\nFor example, Microsoft supplies its Windows software to Dell Technologies, which incorporates it into its personal computers and sells a complete PC system directly to the public. In the traditional sense of the term, Microsoft is the OEM and Dell the VAR. However, the computer's product guide for consumers is most likely to refer to Dell as the OEM.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) vs. Aftermarket\n\nAn OEM is the opposite of the [aftermarket](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aftermarket-parts.asp). An OEM refers to something made specifically for the original product, while the aftermarket refers to equipment made by another company that a consumer may use as a replacement.\n\nFor example, say a person needs to replace their car thermostat, created expressly for their Ford Taurus by ABC Thermostats. They may buy the OEM part, which is a duplicate of their original ABC thermostat that was used in the original manufacturing of the vehicle. Or they may buy an aftermarket part, an alternative made by another company. In other words, if the replacement also comes from ABC company, it is an OEM; otherwise, it is an aftermarket product.\n\nUsually, consumers buy an aftermarket product because it's cheaper (the equivalent of a [generic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generic-brand.asp) drug) or more convenient to obtain. But sometimes aftermarket producers do such a good job in manufacturing a specific part that it becomes well-known to consumers, who actively seek it out.\n\nAn example of this is the success of Hurst Performance of Warminster Township, Penn., a manufacturer of gear shifters for [automobiles](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/auto-industry.asp). Hurst shifters became so well-known for their superior performance that car buyers would insist on having them as a replacement part, or sometimes would purchase and install them before the originals even needed replacing. Hurst also made OEM parts for muscle cars from several automakers.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nThis somewhat contradictory evolution in the use of the term OEM (which can also be used as an adjective, as in \"OEM parts\" or even a verb, as a manufacturer saying it plans to OEM a new gizmo) is usually attributed to the computer hardware industry.\n\nSome VAR companies such as Dell, IBM, and Hewlett Packard started to accept branded parts from outside sources in their own products. So over time, OEM came to refer to companies that rebrand or openly use other manufacturers' products for resale.\n\nMost of this had to do with which company was responsible for [warranties](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warranty.asp), customer support, and other services, but it also reflected a subtle shift in the manufacturing dynamics. In one instance, Dell stopped using chips from anonymous makers and switched to Intel for the computer processors in its computers.\n\nSince Intel is a brand name, it brought [added value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueadded.asp) to Dell’s computers. Not only did Dell advertise this prominently (using the slogan \"Intel Inside!\"), but its marketing materials also suggested that Intel and Dell were equal partners in the processor and computer design. This is a contrast with Dell just telling Intel how to build the processors, as it did with its old suppliers.

{"id": "LyvsyVUP-nLnMl8PIEAuJl_KiBZ4VryEOH-Sms4WJs8", "title": "Law of Supply", "body": "## What Is the Law of Supply?\n\nThe law of supply is the [microeconomic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microeconomics.asp) law that states that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity of goods or services that suppliers offer will increase, and vice versa. The law of supply says that as the price of an item goes up, suppliers will attempt to maximize their profits by increasing the number of items for sale.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The law of supply says that a higher price will induce producers to supply a higher quantity to the market.\n* Because businesses seek to increase revenue, when they expect to receive a higher price for something, they will produce more of it.\n* Supply in a market can be depicted as an upward-sloping supply curve that shows how the quantity supplied will respond to various prices over a period of time.\n\n \n \n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 42 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:42\n\n#### Law of Supply\n\n## Understanding the Law of Supply\n\nThe chart below depicts the law of supply using a [supply curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply-curve.asp), which is upward sloping. A, B, and C are points on the supply curve. Each point on the curve reflects a direct correlation between quantity supplied (Q) and price (P). So, at point A, the quantity supplied will be Q1 and the price will be P1, and so on.\n\nInvestopedia / Julie Bang\n\nThe supply curve is upward sloping because, over time, suppliers can choose how much of their goods to produce and later bring to market. At any given point in time, however, the supply that sellers bring to market is fixed, and sellers simply face a decision to either sell or withhold their stock from a sale; consumer [demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp) sets the price, and sellers can only charge what the market will bear.\n\nIf consumer demand rises over time, the price will rise, and suppliers can choose to devote new resources to production (or new suppliers can enter the market), which increases the [quantity supplied](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitysupplied.asp). Demand ultimately sets the price in a competitive market; supplier response to the price they can expect to receive sets the quantity supplied.  \n\nThe law of supply is one of the most fundamental concepts in [economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economics.asp). It works with the law of demand to explain how market economies allocate resources and determine the prices of goods and services.\n\n### \n\n*British economist [Alfred Marshall](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/economists.asp#toc-3-alfred-marshall-18421924) (1842-1924), a specialist in microeconomics, contributed significantly to supply theory, especially in his pioneering use of the supply curve. He emphasized that the price and output of a good are determined by both supply and demand: The two curves are like scissor blades that intersect at equilibrium.1*\n\n## Examples of the Law of Supply\n\nThe law of supply summarizes the effect price changes have on producer behavior. For example, a business will make more video game systems if the price of those systems increases. The opposite is true if the price of video game systems decreases. The company might supply 1 million systems if the price is $200 each, but if the price increases to $300, they might supply 1.5 million systems.\n\nTo further illustrate this concept, consider how gas prices work. When the price of gasoline rises, it encourages profit-seeking firms to take several actions: expand exploration for oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline; build new oil refineries; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours.\n\nThe law of supply is so intuitive that you may not even be aware of all the examples around you:\n\n* When college students learn that computer engineering jobs pay more than English professor jobs, the supply of students with majors in computer engineering will increase.\n* When consumers start paying more for cupcakes than for donuts, bakeries will increase their output of cupcakes and reduce their output of donuts in order to increase their profits.\n* When your employer pays time and a half for overtime, the number of hours you are willing to supply for work increases.\n\n## What Is the Law of Demand and Supply?\n\nThe law of demand and supply outlines the interaction between a buyer and a seller of a resource. The law of demand and supply says that sellers will supply less of a product or resource as price decreases, while buyers will buy more, and vice versa. \n \n\n## What Is the Best Example of the Law of Supply?\n\nThe law of supply summarizes the effect price changes have on a producer's behavior. For example, a business will make more of a good (such as TVs or cars) if the price of that product increases. \n \n\n## What Are the Types of Law of Supply?\n\nThere are five types of supply—market supply, short-term supply, long-term supply, joint supply, and composite supply. Meanwhile, there are two types of supply curves—individual supply curves and market supply curves. Individual supply curves graph the individual supply schedule, while market supply curves represent the market supply schedule. \n \n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuUCN1rHPUH_mYl9o4UCFbBLiLpgLSdaAQfFlreAfP9tMKp2EfLPbDm1oqNH0s8zEwC4zlm1CnCG6USyiEwiMzRFSdHd8PYzvkFrkby3BMYKZP4WAl4GY9cVUb7JGhAtHCA_RizqawYrL9sqXTmxpCYd-IYwlqn22s4j2Sd7A13NrsdQWptdLZdbxpIFlvPH0gSIwgNoDiVGJ2vPrvV8yQyfwsOszcwrDHx0ynoeGC5RliBrCkUmOKwrgn-ylG3lzjcQhUP-pY_FCDnCUCEsISu46oIzCNuHHePvb4uJPfr8Hxi8RkS3-j07A737YQC6fn09L8-usO00v62&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEIea6B3J1agEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuUCN1rHPUH_mYl9o4UCFbBLiLpgLSdaAQfFlreAfP9tMKp2EfLPbDm1oqNH0s8zEwC4zlm1CnCG6USyiEwiMzRFSdHd8PYzvkFrkby3BMYKZP4WAl4GY9cVUb7JGhAtHCA_RizqawYrL9sqXTmxpCYd-IYwlqn22s4j2Sd7A13NrsdQWptdLZdbxpIFlvPH0gSIwgNoDiVGJ2vPrvV8yQyfwsOszcwrDHx0ynoeGC5RliBrCkUmOKwrgn-ylG3lzjcQhUP-pY_FCDnCUCEsISu46oIzCNuHHePvb4uJPfr8Hxi8RkS3-j07A737YQC6fn09L8-usO00v62&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEIea6B3J1agEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "W7I_jbRaw3DnNHPVVza4wfFTvaTxiZv3Gy8Q0OvTFpg", "title": "Organizational Structure", "body": "## What Is an Organizational Structure?\n\nAn organizational structure is a system that outlines how certain activities are directed in order to achieve the goals of an organization. These activities can include rules, roles, and responsibilities.\n\nThe organizational structure also determines how information flows between levels within the company. For example, in a centralized structure, decisions flow from the top down, while in a decentralized structure, decision-making power is distributed among various levels of the organization.\n\nHaving an organizational structure in place allows companies to remain efficient and focused.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* An organizational structure outlines how certain activities are directed to achieve the goals of an organization.\n* Successful organizational structures define each employee's job and how it fits within the overall system.\n* A centralized structure has a defined chain of command, while decentralized structures give almost every employee receiving a high level of personal agency.\n* Types of organizational structures include functional, divisional, flatarchy, and matrix structures. \n* Senior leaders should consider a variety of factors before deciding which type of organization is best for their business, including the business goals, industry, and culture of the company.\n\n## Understanding an Organizational Structure\n\nBusinesses of all shapes and sizes use organizational structures heavily. They define a specific [hierarchy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-hierarchy.asp) within an organization. A successful organizational structure defines each employee's job and how it fits within the overall system. Put simply, the organizational structure lays out who does what so the company can meet its objectives.\n\nThis structuring provides a company with a visual representation of how it is shaped and how it can best move forward in achieving its goals. Organizational structures are normally illustrated in some sort of chart or diagram like a pyramid, where the most powerful members of the organization sit at the top, while those with the least amount of power are at the bottom.\n\nNot having a formal structure in place may prove difficult for certain organizations. For instance, employees may have difficulty knowing to whom they should report. That can lead to uncertainty as to who is responsible for what in the organization.\n\nHaving a structure in place can help with [efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficiency.asp) and provide clarity for everyone at every level. That also means each and every department can be more productive, as they are likely to be more focused on energy and time.\n\n## Centralized vs. Decentralized Organizational Structures\n\nAn organizational structure is either centralized or decentralized. Traditionally, organizations have been structured with centralized leadership and a defined chain of command. The military is an organization famous for its highly centralized structure, with a long and specific hierarchy of superiors and subordinates. In a centralized organizational system, there are very clear responsibilities for each role, with subordinate roles defaulting to the guidance of their superiors.\n\nThere has been a rise in decentralized organizations, as is the case with many technology [startups](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp). This allows companies to remain fast, agile, and adaptable, with almost every employee receiving a high level of personal agency. For example, Johnson & Johnson is a company that's known for its decentralized structure.2 As a large company with over 200 business units and brands that function in sometimes very different industries, each operates autonomously. Even in decentralized companies, there are still usually built-in hierarchies (such as the chief operating officer operating at a higher level than an entry-level associate). However, teams are empowered to make their own decisions and come to the best conclusion without necessarily getting \"approval\" from up top.\n\n## Types of Organizational Structures\n\n### Functional Structure\n\nFour types of common organizational structures are implemented in the real world. The first and most common is a functional structure. This is also referred to as a [bureaucratic organizational structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bureaucracy.asp) and breaks up a company based on the specialization of its workforce. Most small-to-medium-sized businesses implement a functional structure. Dividing the firm into departments consisting of marketing, sales, and operations is the act of using a bureaucratic organizational structure.\n\n### Divisional or Multidivisional Structure\n\nThe second type is common among large companies with many business units. Called the divisional or multidivisional structure, a company that uses this method structures its leadership team based on the products, projects, or subsidiaries they operate. A good example of this structure is Johnson & Johnson. With thousands of products and lines of business, the company structures itself so each business unit operates as its own company with its own president.\n\n### Flatarchy Structure\n\nFlatarchy, a newer structure, is the third type and is used among many startups. As the name alludes, it flattens the hierarchy and chain of command and gives its employees a lot of autonomy. Companies that use this type of structure have a high speed of implementation.\n\n### Matrix Structure\n\nThe fourth and final organizational structure is a matrix structure. It is also the most confusing and the least used. This structure matrixes employees across different superiors, divisions, or departments. An employee working for a matrixed company, for example, may have duties in both sales and [customer service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp).\n\n## Benefits of Organizational Structures\n\nPutting an organizational structure in place can be very beneficial to a company. The structure not only defines a company's hierarchy but also allows the firm to layout the pay structure for its employees. By putting the organizational structure in place, the firm can decide salary grades and ranges for each position.\n\nThe structure also makes operations more efficient and much more effective. By separating employees and functions into different departments, the company can perform different operations at once seamlessly.\n\nIn addition, a very clear organizational structure informs employees how best to get their jobs done. For example, in a hierarchical organization, employees will have to work harder at buying favor or courting those with decision-making power. In a decentralized organization, employees must take on more initiative and bring creative problem solving to the table. This can also help set expectations for how employees can track their own growth within a company and emphasize a certain set of skills—as well as for potential employees to gauge if such a company would be a good fit with their own interests and work styles.\n\n## What Are the Four Types of Organizational Structures?\n\nThe four types of organizational structures are functional, divisional, flatarchy, and matrix structures. \n\n## What Are the Key Elements of an Organizational Structure?\n\nKey elements of an organizational structure include how certain activities are directed in order to achieve the goals of an organization, such as rules, roles, responsibilities, and how information flows between levels within the company.\n\n## What Is an Organizational Structure Example?\n\nAn example of an organizational structure is a decentralized structure, which gives individuals and teams high degrees of autonomy without needing a core team to regularly approve business decisions. A good example of this decentralized structure is Johnson & Johnson. With thousands of products and lines of business, the company structures itself so each business unit operates as its own company with its own president.\n\n## What Is an Organizational Structure Chart?\n\nOrganizational structures are normally illustrated in some sort of chart or diagram like a pyramid, where the most powerful members of the organization sit at the top, while those with the least amount of power are at the bottom.\n\n## What Is the Best Organizational Structure?\n\nThere is no one best organizational structure, as it depends on the nature of the company and the industry it operates in.", "timestamp": 1655173243, "digest": "jL6vk1-pq2np6Gp3rgxYpa4LChm1Yrjmlvc9PCEEN_s", "contributor": "0x382FdEf874E2989f6eCE2C1cF960Dfe12bCda5Cd"}
{"id": "m-xqm6wqVaog_RlXcYt2h61na_M59ZCd9qBplfG7DyQ", "title": "Outsourcing", "body": "## What Is Outsourcing?\n\nOutsourcing is the business practice of hiring a party outside a company to perform services or create goods that were traditionally performed [in-house](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/in-house.asp) by the company's own employees and staff. Outsourcing is a practice usually undertaken by companies as a cost-cutting measure. As such, it can affect a wide range of jobs, ranging from customer support to manufacturing to the back office.\n\nOutsourcing was first recognized as a business strategy in 1989 and became an integral part of business economics throughout the 1990s.1 The practice of outsourcing is subject to considerable controversy in many countries. Those opposed argue that it has caused the loss of domestic jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Supporters say it creates an incentive for businesses and companies to allocate resources where they are most effective, and that outsourcing helps maintain the nature of [free-market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp) economies on a global scale.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Companies use outsourcing to cut labor costs, including salaries for their personnel, overhead, equipment, and technology.\n* Outsourcing is also used by companies to dial down and focus on the core aspects of the business, spinning off the less critical operations to outside organizations.\n* [On the downside](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/whats-difference-between-outsourcing-and-insourcing.asp), communication between the company and outside providers can be hard, and security threats can amp up when multiple parties can access sensitive data.\n* Some companies will outsource as a way to move things around on the balance sheet.\n* Outsourcing employees, such as with 1099 contract workers, can benefit the company when it comes to paying taxes.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 13 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:13\n\n#### Outsourcing\n\n## Understanding Outsourcing\n\nOutsourcing can help businesses reduce labor costs significantly. When a company uses outsourcing, it enlists the help of outside organizations not affiliated with the company to complete certain tasks. The outside organizations typically set up different compensation structures with their employees than the outsourcing company, enabling them to complete the work for less money. This ultimately enables the company that chose to outsource to lower its labor costs.\n\nBusinesses can also avoid expenses associated with [overhead](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overhead.asp), equipment, and technology.\n\nIn addition to cost savings, companies can employ an outsourcing strategy to better focus on the core aspects of the business. Outsourcing non-core activities can improve efficiency and productivity because another entity performs these smaller tasks better than the firm itself. This strategy may also lead to faster turnaround times, increased competitiveness within an industry, and the cutting of overall operational costs.\n\nCompanies use outsourcing to cut labor costs and business expenses, but also to enable them to focus on the core aspects of the business.\n\n## Examples of Outsourcing\n\nOutsourcing's biggest advantages are time and cost savings. A manufacturer of personal computers might buy internal components for its machines from other companies to save on production costs. A law firm might store and back up its files using a cloud-computing service provider, thus giving it access to digital technology without investing large amounts of money to actually own the technology.\n\nA small company may decide to outsource bookkeeping duties to an accounting firm, as doing so may be cheaper than retaining an in-house accountant. Other companies find outsourcing the functions of human resource departments, such as payroll and health insurance, as beneficial. When used properly, outsourcing is an effective strategy to reduce expenses, and can even provide a business with a [competitive advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp) over rivals.\n\n## Criticism of Outsourcing\n\nOutsourcing does have disadvantages. Signing contracts with other companies may take time and extra effort from a firm's legal team. Security threats occur if another party has access to a company's confidential information and then that party suffers a data breach. A lack of communication between the company and the outsourced provider may occur, which could delay the completion of projects.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nOutsourcing internationally can help companies benefit from the differences in labor and production costs among countries. Price dispersion in another country may entice a business to relocate some or all of its operations to the cheaper country in order to increase profitability and stay competitive within an industry. Many large corporations have eliminated their entire in-house customer service call centers, outsourcing that function to third-party outfits located in lower-cost locations.\n\n## What Is Outsourcing?\n\nFirst seen as a formal business strategy in 1989, outsourcing is the process of hiring third parties to conduct services that were typically performed by the company. Often, outsourcing is used so that a company can focus on its core operations. It is also used to cut costs on labor, among others. While privacy has been a recent area of controversy for outsourcing contractors, it has also drawn criticism for its impact on the labor market in domestic economies.\n\n## What Is an Example of Outsourcing?\n\nConsider a bank that outsources its customer service operations. Here, all customer-facing inquiries or complaints with concern to its online banking service would be handled by a third party. While choosing to outsource some business operations is often a complex decision, the bank determined that it would prove to be the most effective allocation of capital, given both consumer demand, the specialty of the third-party, and cost-saving attributes. \n\n## What Are the Disadvantages of Outsourcing?\n\nThe disadvantages of outsourcing include communication difficulties, security threats where sensitive data is increasingly at stake, and additional legal duties. On a broader level, outsourcing may have the potential to disrupt a labor force. One example that often comes to mind is the manufacturing industry in America, where now a large extent of production has moved internationally. In turn, higher-skilled manufacturing jobs, such as robotics or precision machines, have emerged at a greater scale.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nWhile outsourcing can be advantageous to an organization that values time over money, some downsides can materialize if the organization needs to retain control. Outsourcing manufacturing of a simple item like clothing will carry much less risk than outsourcing something complex like rocket fuel or financial modeling. Businesses looking to outsource need to adequately compare the benefits and risks before moving forward.", "timestamp": 1655173474, "digest": "F9_kK3uR9BFouULhBNspd-4ve0EKgAo-sHZsHDxb5_0", "contributor": "0x1b33861855453bD8FBD4e9Eb309e5c202B82CF0f"}
