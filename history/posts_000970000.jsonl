Subsequent articles will analyze the decentralized exchange of assets and decentralized lending and derivatives. These articles assume a foundational knowledge of both financial markets and [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) technology.\n\nThe most widely used application of blockchain technology is in the creation of digital currencies, which has required the development of financial markets to support their exchange. However, these financial markets, in their current state, prevent fair and open access. Furthermore, the infrastructure that supports blockchain-based markets is vulnerable to counterparty risk, censorship, a lack of transparency, and manipulation as it remains largely centralized. Current infrastructure flaws erode trust and inhibit adoption.\n\nJust as the internet allowed for the creation of a new information infrastructure, [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) technology allows for the creation of a new financial infrastructure and the development of entirely new markets. The [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) movement has emerged in an attempt to make the infrastructure that supports new and existing blockchain-based markets just as decentralized as the underlying technology.\n\n\n---\n\n## The DeFi Dream\n\nIn a functioning decentralized financial system, internet connection would be the only prerequisite to accessing financial services, rather than geography or circumstance. A reduction in the centralization of those that control and own the infrastructure underpinning financial markets would increase transparency, decrease costs, and reduce the opportunity for censorship and / or manipulation. The global “unbanked” (both individuals and enterprises) would gain access to financial services. [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) would not only facilitate markets for illiquid financial products that already exist but would also allow for the creation of new financial products and markets that don’t yet exist. The ability to more effectively arbitrage, borrow, hedge, and access liquidity would spur more institutions to join the movement without restricting the usage of these products and markets exclusively to them.\n\n## The DeFi Reality\n\nWhile [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/dapps) is referred to as “open finance” and is sometimes touted as a way to “bank the unbanked,” the truth of the matter is these products aren’t aimed at the mass retail investor, let alone the global “unbanked.” Technology is not usually the primary factor restricting access to financial services. More often than not, [identity ](https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/the-impact-of-digital-identity-9eed5b0c3016)and/or oppressive regimes are. On the retail side, it is unreasonable to believe that the average retail investor would understand the risk profile of even the simplest DeFi products and I’ve yet to hear a compelling argument for why the average retail investor would need access to exotic financial derivatives. UX/UI challenges present further obstacles to retail adoption.\n\nProduct-market fit for most institutional investors is not any clearer. Most DeFi projects aren’t well suited for HFT (high-frequency trading) since they’re limited in terms of speed. They are not well suited to trading large positions either and traditional finance institutions won’t even consider entering into transactions in which their counterparty is unknown. At this point, institutional traders aren’t willing to make these trade-offs so long as they can trust at least one other person in the markets in which they operate.\n\nAs a result, product-market fit is currently constrained to crypto-native power users that are comfortable with the existing UX/UI challenges of crypto networks and blockchain-based assets. For user adoption to accelerate, the trade-offs required by [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) interfaces must not outweigh the perceived benefit of ownership, access, and transparency when compared with centralized alternatives. A lack of developer education and tools is also restraining the industry. Tooling and services need to be further developed and a best-in-class stack needs to be established so that users don’t have to interact with a fragmented ecosystem marching in fragmented directions. Developers, regulators, lawyers, investors, professional traders, and retail users will have to work together to overcome existing challenges.\n\n> As a result, the transition towards a decentralized financial system is more likely to be evolutionary than revolutionary. That doesn’t diminish the potential of DeFi to reshape the way in which markets function and the way that the entire world interacts and transacts.\n\nWhile the DeFi movement has the potential to provide meaningful benefits over centralized alternatives, there are many practical challenges the DeFi industry needs to overcome first. **User adoption may be the biggest impediment to the development of the industry at present, new risks compounded across protocols may be the biggest threat to its sustainability.** An in-depth look at the 7 most pertinent challenges follows.\n\n### 1.) Identity and Reputation\n\nThe first step in entering into a financial transaction often requires the identification of transacting parties. However, a core tenant of [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) is that one’s ability to access financial services should not be dependent on most aspects of identity. This is problematic as violations of [KYC ](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2016/02/07/fincen-know-your-customer-requirements/)/ [AML ](https://www.finra.org/industry/anti-money-laundering)/ [OFAC ](https://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/olm_037.htm)regulations can not only result in large fines but could result in criminal charges. If a [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) Relayer (an entity that hosts on order book on a DeFi protocol) facilitates an exchange between unknown parties and those parties turn out to violate any of these regulations, the consequences may be serious. Furthermore, without a way to enforce identity, most proposals for decentralized governance of these projects are quickly reduced to plutocracy.\n\nWhile still far from complete solutions, projects are researching ways to allow for KYC (know your customer procedures) without introducing centralization. For example, Relayers on [0x](https://0x.org/why) can opt-in to implement a [permissioned liquidity pool ](https://blog.0xproject.com/compliant-peer-to-peer-trading-4dab8e5c3162)that ensures that pool is only accessible to whitelisted [Ethereum](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/ethereum/) addresses that meet certain requirements, such as those required by AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC policies. However, this method still doesn’t ensure identity in a way that allows one to know that a counterparty is trustworthy without excluding those outside of the traditional financial system and introducing centralization. Several parties have issued EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) to incorporate KYC/AML compliance into ERC-20 tokens. However, in many cases, these proposals would still require service providers to work together off-chain via a consortium to review each others’ KYC policies and it is still unclear whether these proposals would fully satisfy regulatory requirements.\n\nEstablishing reputation in [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) networks is a distinct challenge. This is a strong industry focus as the range of possible products expands when there is a sense of on-chain reputation. There are currently two main ways to attempt to establish reputation in these networks:\n\n* Allowing everyone to start on an equal playing field under the assumption that network participants are good actors. Participants that prove to be untrustworthy / uncreditworthy would subsequently be slashed (punished.) Underwriters on the Dharma network fall into this category, wherein they gradually build reputation over time via an on-chain record of their accuracy and behavior.\n* Porting existing credit data to a [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) network via an oracle. This is hardly an improvement over the traditional finance system in terms of allowing for fair access.\n\nThe lack of an on-chain reputation method that doesn’t require users to reveal too much about their personal identity means most DeFi projects require (over)collateralization in lieu of being able to establish trustworthiness.\n\n### 2.) Capital Inefficiency\n\nThe overcollateralization required by DeFi projects is capital inefficient. [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/da/) requires users to deposit 1.5x the value of ETH to establish the collateralized debt position underpinning Dai (CDPs will be covered in more depth in *Risk Off or On?: Decentralized Lending and Derivatives*.) Even still, most people choose to keep their “loan-to-value” ratio at 300 percent in order to avoid double digit liquidation penalties.¹ Similarly, Compound requires a 2x collateralization ratio, which the company says will decrease over time.² However, some users indicated a willingness to post 4x–5x the required collateral.²\n\n> ***Until a decentralized reputation system is developed, there is little choice but to require users to lock up excess capital, dulling the benefit of taking out these positions to begin with. Even when/if reputation is solved, the volatility of the underlying positions could result in a persistent preference to overcollateralize.***\n\n### 3.) Oracles\n\nCorruption of on-chain oracles (the mechanism that finds and submits real-world data to a smart contract) is a huge concern for these systems since liquidation occurs automatically in the event that collateral levels drop below their specified “loan-to-value” ratios. Different DeFi projects approach oracles in different ways, but many projects in the space are using MakerDAO’s oracle. MakerDAO’s oracle is currently designed to support single collateral Dai (backed entirely by ETH) but will be re-designed to support multi-collateral Dai (backed by a pool of different cryptocurrencies) in the near future. MakerDAO’s oracle pulls data from sixteen different sources for its oracle feed. These sources are comprised of [Ethereum](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/ethereum/) addresses voted on by MKR token holders, which are then submitted to an autonomous smart contract. The oracle chooses the median of all sixteen submitted data points. This system allows for 51% tolerance as it excludes the outliers which are more likely to be submitted by malicious actors.¹ Importantly\\*\\*,\\*\\* MakerDAO also utilizes an oracle security module in which the second layer of the protocol can activate an emergency shut down. This shut down freezes the system at its last known “safe state” if it has reason to believe the oracle may have been compromised. If an emergency shutdown occurs, users can convert their Dai to ETH at the equivalent of 1$/1 Dai, according to the state of the ledger at its last determined “safe state.¹”\n\nSingle collateral Dai oracles update every time the price of ETH fluctuates by +/-1.0% but multi-collateral Dai (MCD) oracles will update once an hour.¹ This allows the sixteen oracle inputs to be viewable for an hour before they are acted upon, increasing transparency. However, such a long lag time may not be appropriate considering the volatility of cryptoassets. The company’s argument that this delay can be compensated for by the risk model is questionable. Furthermore, liquidation of collateralized positions (essentially defaults) will be executed via auction with MCD, which means it will “six hours or more” to liquidate positions as the protocol accesses “all the arbitrageurs and liquidity across the whole marketplace and ecosystem.¹” The impact of having to wait 6 hours to unwind a single position during times of market distress, or failure, would be significant.\n\n[Compound ](https://compound.finance/)takes a different approach with its oracle, aggregating and averaging price feeds from a series of exchanges and posting them on-chain consistently. The data updates every time the underlying value fluctuates by +/- 0.1%, but data is updated on-chain every 15–30 seconds, confined by the processing speed of Ethereum.² Given the importance of oracles in these systems, DeFi projects may want to more closely consider which method they use or choose to implement their own methods.\n\n### 4.) Network: Platform, Liquidity, Scale\n\nMost current DeFi solutions are built on top of Ethereum and therefore DeFi’s adoption is tied to the scalability and usability of the Ethereum network. The scalability debate is well known (and addressed below) while usability remains a challenge as mainstream users still struggle to easily interact with [Web 3.0](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/web-3-0/).\n\n> ***While the composability of protocols built on Ethereum creates even larger switching costs, it also introduces network risk. As more projects build on Ethereum, it may become harder to upgrade the base layer protocol in a way that allows for backwards compatibility.***\n\nPart of the power of DeFi is that it allows for the creation of new markets. However, decentralized markets suffer the same circular problem that all new markets do: adoption is required to generate liquidity, but liquidity is a driver of adoption. While DeFi can enable new markets and allow new participants to access them, it does not automatically create liquid markets for these products. This is a problem because assets that are illiquid tend to trade at a discount to their liquid counterparts.³ It also creates inefficient pricing as opportunities for arbitrage go uncaptured since it remains difficult to move quickly and seamlessly between crypto markets.\n\nAlex Evans of Placeholder VC [breaks down ](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/4/9/defi-liquidity-models)the models of current DeFi networks into three broad categories:\n\n* Those that require users to find peers to trade with. *[Augur](https://www.augur.net/), [0x](https://0x.org/why), [Dharm](https://www.dharma.io/)a*\n* Those that pool “maker” assets and offer them to “takers” for a fee. *[Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/)*\n* Those that set parameters through governance, allowing users to trade directly with a smart contract. Ex: *[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/da/)*\n\nEach model has implications for liquidity. The lack of requirement to find a specific peer with which to trade seems to be the design advantage of the top protocols. These protocols also tend to offer fewer options in terms of products / use cases, which pools demand, facilitating better liquidity. Alex Evans also believes automatic and consistent processes (MakerDAO) better facilitate liquidity than bespoke and varied ones (Augur.) This seems to have been one of the drivers behind [UMA ](https://umaproject.org/)and Dharma deciding to set tighter parameters on their products (relative to a completely open system in which individual users set all parameters.)\n\n> ***“At least initially, the markets that have built deep pooled liquidity in a handful of important markets appear to have the adoption lead versus those that have tried to create a multi-asset infrastructure.” — Alex Evans***\n\nAssuming these markets find a way to bootstrap the necessary liquidity, [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/blockchain/) infrastructure is not yet scalable enough to process volumes similar to those processed by centralized exchanges. For a sense of the limited scale of current DeFi networks, investor at [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/), Arjun Balaji, [predicts ](https://medium.com/@arjunblj/crypto-theses-for-2019-dd20cb7f9895)that December 2019’s aggregate volume on 0x will lag a single day’s volume on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). While advances are being made in Layer 2 scalability and innovative solutions such as [StarkDEX ](https://blog.0xproject.com/starkdex-bringing-starks-to-ethereum-6a03fffc0eb7)(currently partnering with 0x) show promise, current [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/blockchain/) infrastructure has a long way to go before it can support volumes similar to those supported in traditional markets.\n\n*\\*\\*Front-running, and other opportunities for manipulation, on DeFi networks will be addressed in Trade-Offs: Decentralized Exchange.\\*\\**\n\n### 5.) Business Models Still Undefined\n\nWhile there are many options, most DeFi projects have left their monetization method “undefined” and are focused on “defining the incentives of the protocol at large.⁴” However, at some point these projects will need to generate revenue if they are to persist.\n\n[dYdX ](https://dydx.exchange/')[highlights](http://unchained.forbes.libsynpro.com/how-dydx-allows-you-to-take-a-short-position-in-one-token-ep86) three main monetization models for DeFi projects:\n\n* Value accrual via a native token. *MakerDAO (MKR)*\n* Monetization via fees. P*otentially Compound*\n* Monetization via a user facing application. *dYdX, Dharma, etc.*\n\nIn most cases, a native token monetization model introduces another layer of friction to user adoption. For other projects it might not make sense. For example, a token monetization model doesn’t make much sense in networks where ownership / voting percentage can be determined by participation, which is recorded on-chain.² Nadav Hollander of Dharma points out that a fee model implemented at the protocol level, in addition to being somewhat anathema to blockchain ideology, could easily be forked away.⁴ However, Compound is not against keeping a small amount of the interest flowing through the system in a model akin to the AUM model in traditional finance.²\n\nThe latter appears to be the prevailing model. Dharma, dYdX, and others found that they needed to build out full stack products ([Expo ](https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/introducing-expo-ffe74a328f85)on dYdX, for example) because they found that developers weren’t willing to invest the time necessary to build on these new protocols. While the 0x model is often touted as the exemplary model, 0x’s success was enabled, in part, because there was already an existing market for DEXs (decentralized exchanges.) 0x’s protocol opened into an existing market, whereas these new DeFi protocols have to create new markets from scratch.\n\n> ***In an effort to bypass many of the challenges of creating a two-sided marketplace from scratch, it’s likely that new DeFi protocols will continue to build out full stack services and monetize those, at least over the near term.***\n\nIt is important to remember that creating a marketplace is a service business and that is unlikely to change. Whatever entity enables a marketplace also has to offer services to both the demand and supply sides. Marketplaces can’t be created out of thin air, even by the smartest protocols. They will always require a team / company to support the ecosystem with the services that allow marketplaces to live and grow.\n\n> ***As a result, designing businesses with “minimal viable decentralization” may be a more efficient way of launching of products and approaching early governance⁶ although its likely to be viewed less favorably by those that prioritize decentralization above all else.***\n\nDeFi business models are not constrained to the above mentioned models. For example, [Arwen ](https://www.arwen.io/)is planning to monetize via a revenue sharing agreement with centralized exchanges for the trades referred by Arwen⁵ (further details will be provided in *Trade-Offs: Decentralized Exchange*\\*\\*.\\*\\*)\n\n### 6.) New Risks Compounding Across Protocols\n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain-based markets have fundamentally different characteristics than their traditional counterparts. DeFi protocols benefit from composibility which leads to faster innovation, but also results in higher levels of interdependancy. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that the risk profile of these products, especially in combination, is not yet fully understood. While each project claims to have developed its own robust risk models, the complexity of analyzing these new risks across interdependent protocols is non-trivial\\*\\*.\\*\\* It’s also worth noting that most risk models weren’t very useful in 2008. In some cases, these models failed because just one assumption was flawed.\n\nMany of these projects utilize concepts that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, but more importantly, they utilize them in new and untested ways. For example, the rehypothecation of collateral\\*\\*,\\*\\* fractional ownership of structured products, and pooling of risk were all elements of the 2008 financial crisis. DeFi takes these concepts and applies them to highly volatile and hard to value assets in relatively illiquid markets with insufficient safeguards. The combination of all of these factors, combined with the complexity of creating a cohesive view of collateral rehypothecated across protocols, creates an entirely new risk profile for which there is little precedent. [Superfluid collateral](https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-to-earn-money-on-collateral-in-defi-and-why-thats-risky/)? Let’s not do this.\n\nIn this context, it’s worth considering what a market failure would look like. MakerDAO is an experimental network upon which the success of many other projects depends. It is important to remember that in the case of market failure, CDPs and other DeFi products are not insured and a third-party is not likely to step in to recapitalize small cap crypto start-ups (moral hazard debate aside.) Investors, users, and token holders will be responsible for recapitalizing this highly interdependent DeFi system.\n\nThe systemic impact would likely be jarring. Dai is commonly traded on 0x Relayers as a pair with ETH. It is often deposited on Compound and then lent out again to hedge funds to be used for risk-on trades. dYdX is also dependent upon MakerDAO since its short ETH token is long Dai. dYdX further depends on Dharma (which lends in Dai) and the 0x protocol (which facilitates the trading of Dai) to access liquidity. The cascading effect of a failure of any one of these protocols would likely cause a systemic unwind that is rapid (due to volatility of underlying, rehypothecation, and automated execution of smart contracts), jarring (these markets are not as liquid as traditional markets), and significant. The rewards may be high, but the risk is at least commensurate.\n\n> Cryptoeconomics don’t defy the principals of regular economics and cryptofinance (DeFi) can’t escape the classic risk/reward constraint of regular finance.\n\n### 7.) Regulation\n\nThe primary concern regarding regulation of the industry doesn’t seem to be that current regulations are too restrictive, but rather the concern is related to the ambiguity as to how existing regulations will be applied in regards to blockchain-based networks and cryptocurrencies. Many of the startups in the space don’t know how to determine whether they should launch or not because the regulatory environment they are operating in is so unclear. The cost of all this uncertainty is high.\n\n> ***In fact, the regulatory burden is so high that some start- ups have determined that they don’t have enough capital to launch in a fully compliant manner, made all the more difficult by the recent crypto winter fundraising environment.***\n\n\n---\n\n## From Dream to Reality\n\nProjects in the space are acutely aware of the above cited problems and are actively working to overcome them. For example, Dharma now pays gas fees for users to make the user experience easier while MakerDAO is planning to abstract the process of converting Dai to MKR upon redemption for MCD. Networks across the board are increasingly removing the requirement to hold native tokens, choosing to replace them with more widely used cryptocurrencies such as Dai or ETH. This is an important step since it removes what has historically been a hurdle to DeFi adoption.\n\nNew innovations and projects also enter the space frequently and could provide solutions to many of the weaknesses of current projects. For example, the Arwen protocol is ideally suited to HFT since only the opening and closing of escrow gets posted on-chain, while the rest of the protocol operates like a Layer 2 channel, allowing trading to happen much more quickly.⁵ The trade is also only visible to the trading party and the exchange. Since there is no on-chain execution of individual trades, miners do not see the transactions ahead of time, eliminating most of the front running issues that DEXs face.⁵ The protocol could also solve other critical painpoints, such as allowing for fractionally collateralized options (which dYdX is actively working towards), trustless fiat conversion (via integration with banks) and quicker movement of tokens across exchanges, allowing for effective arbitrage.⁵\n\nIn 2017–2018, the main focus in the DeFi industry was on building DEX scalability and liquidity. Solutions for each are quickly evolving. The focus in 2018–2019 has shifted to lending. The composability of DeFi products should allow the whole ecosystem to move forward at a faster pace and may allow for more mainstream adoption throughout 2019, as users are lured into the ecosystem via multiple protocols (trading, lending, derivatives) that all require users to transact with cryptocurrency.\n\nMany of these dynamics could spur more usage and adoption in the next eighteen months, creating the flywheel effect common in two-sided markets. The key point is to acknowledge that while the challenges are persistent and numerous, the industry is far from stagnant, and real and rapid progress is being made. However, risks need to be seriously assessed and considered so that this progress can be sustained.\n\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n*All interviews personally conducted are unattributed*\n\n1. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/rune-christensen-of-makerdao-part-1-how-to-keep-a-crypto-collateralized-stablecoin-afloat/>\n2. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-youll-earn-interest-on-your-crypto-with-compound-ep-82/>\n3. <http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/country/illiquidity.pdf>).\n4. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/nadav-hollander-on-how-dharma-could-create-new-forms-of-debt-ep-80/>\n5. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-to-trade-on-crypto-exchanges-without-fear-of-hacks/>\n6.

{"id": "cfiXcIbu8fZ30_qWpmTGQuKqJw5tOB2ysU8uszvyWuk", "title": "learning by daoing: designing for the unique properties of daos", "body": "at the most basic level, daos are simple. they facilitate two things: collective ownership and collective decision making. it starts to get more complicated when we consider the many ways to design daos. when it comes to designing daos, we spend too much time talking about how each dao is different and not enough time thinking about the ways in which they are the same. this lack of design framework either forces us to resort to traditional companies as a baseline model (porting over many of the limitations of traditional organizations) or to forgo any framework at all and struggle to manage a dao’s evolution.\n\nthrough the (currently painful) process of daoing, i’ve identified several inherent properties common across functional daos. by designing daos with these common properties in mind, we can not only improve the experience of daoing but also design systems that accomplish more than traditional corporations ever have (one example [here](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)).\n\nthese properties are: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, Transparency\n\n\n---\n\n## Autonomy\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to make your own decisions without being controlled by anyone else; the right of an organization, country, or region to be independent and govern itself ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/autonomy)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** in contrast to traditional corporations, daos cannot be controlled or *[captured](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)*\n* **design principle:** *design for the highest degree of autonomy (weakly linked, autonomous sub-daos) while providing checks and balances on distributed power*\n\nthe biggest difference between corporations and daos is that daos can be capture-resistant, meaning they incorporate mechanisms to prevent the capture of shared resources by bad actors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). in traditional corporate structures, capture resistance is weakly ensured via trust and reputation, since both matter in the repeated game of public business. internal capture is prevented via regulations enforced by higher-level, external agencies. daos require different assurances against capture since trust, reputation, and regulation are mostly absent in large, somewhat anonymous, digitally native networks. daos can be designed to be capture-resistant, but most aren’t. there are three main ways a dao can be captured:\n\n### 1.) control over decision making\n\nthe 2020 wave of daos pioneered “[progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/),” or turning control over to a community once a protocol built by a centralized core team achieved product-market-fit. this approach prevents the core team from being distracted by building a community and a product at the same time, and avoids design by committee, which isn’t usually conducive to shipping products. this method **builds community around collective ownership**, launching a token once operations are “sufficiently decentralized” and suddenly turning decision making over to a group of new token holders, usually via token-weighted governance. all decision making has been centralized up to this point and a large portion of product-related decisions often remain centralized. since decision making has been centralized from the start, decentralizing it can feel like giving up control, which core teams are often reluctant to do.\n\ncommunity members are drawn in by a token launch, not by co-building or participating in the network over time, which can create communities that are more speculative in nature. given a lack of other criteria, like previous contributions to the dao, tokens are generally distributed based on retroactive usage, which has proven to be a weak contributor acquisition method. contributors quickly become frustrated by a low degree of involvement in decision making. these dynamics can result in lower voter participation, making any decentralized decision making less capture-resistant as less voices are represented.\n\nregardless of the path towards decentralization, token-weighted governance increases the possibility of capture in the decision making process, the risks of which are well outlined [here](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html). Optimism’s two house governance system is a positive first step towards more capture-resistant governance (more [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/).)\n\n> **for daos to be capture-resistant, we must decouple power (decision making rights) from wealth (token holdings)**\n\n### 2.) control over resources\n\nto avoid some of these challenges, we experimented with a different decentralization method at [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/). our hope was to **build a community around collective decision making**, by inviting contributors to co-create with us much earlier in the decentralization process (pre-token) rather than building a community around collective ownership of an already finished product and token. We involved our community gradually in non-core business operations, spinning up a series of community-led working groups. however, since there was no mechanism for *decentralized* decision making, working groups were still reliant on external stakeholders for access to critical resources (in this case a centralized company, without a governance mechanism). as a result, our working groups were vulnerable to capture and we made the decision to pause this experiment until we could empower working groups with more autonomy.\n\neven when decentralized decision making does exist, the party controlling the resources (ie. parent dao) still has lower context as to the value a working group provides. while working groups may be equipped with their own budgets, they are still subject to a budget allocation process that is outside their control. even with a token to align incentives between a parent dao and a working group, the value a working group adds may not be reflected in the token value of the parent (ie. metagovernance, the value of which is hard to tie back to a core business value.)\n\n> **when one group controls access to resources for another, the relationship becomes adversarial**\n\nwhile working groups help to control and separate scope within a monolithic organization, the higher autonomy design choice is to replace them with multiple sub-daos. autonomous sub-daos allow communities to organize around specific goals with complete autonomy over how to achieve them, to maintain direct ownership over their own resources, and to share directly in any upside generated from their efforts.\n\nthese sub-daos can focus on building either the supply side (to increase the scale/scope of product offerings) or the demand side (to explore new use cases or aggregate users). they may also take the form of a subsidiary, providing services across the ecosystem (ie. metagovernance.) all sub-daos should have economically sustainable business models, so they are not dependent on external parties for resources, but a native token quickly becomes an important means of creating “[weak strategic alignment](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)” between daos via token swaps (more on this method [here](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1505977366991974402); see [MetricsDAO](https://twitter.com/MetricsDAO) and [Goblin Sax](https://twitter.com/goblinsax)).\n\n### 3.) control over execution\n\nthe greatest opportunity for capture occurs at the execution phase. governance generally works as follows (see more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)):\n\n* a proposal is put forward\n* the community votes on a proposal\n* the outcome of the proposal is either autonomously executed on-chain or an off-chain action is executed by a select party\n* execution is verified and / or analyzed by the community\n\nexecution is the phase most vulnerable to capture since nothing prevents those with execution power (ie. multi-sig signers) from ignoring the will of voters and executing whatever actions they choose. this doesn’t mean we should eliminate all positions of trust within daos. there is a common misconception that in order to avoid capture, decentralized organizations must be flat. but daos are leaderful, not leaderless. daos can still have hierarchy, it’s just that it’s fluid.\n\npositions of trust (like those with execution power) should be elected or legitimized by the broader community with clear mechanisms for removal if/when the responsibilities of those positions are abused or neglected. [Yearn’s gov 2.0](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460) proposes such a model, wherein highly autonomous yTeams are empowered by YFI holders to act independently in the best interest of yearn, within a constrained domain of action and discrete decision-making powers, subject to monitoring by YFI holders which have the power to remove contributors if roles are abused (more [here](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460)).\n\n> **being a leader in a dao is the most humbling thing I’ve ever done because you cannot rely on static positional authority. you must constantly earn respect with the community. on the good days, it’s meritocracy; on the bad days, trial by jury.**\n\npositions of trust don’t need to be open to the entire dao. while power should be distributed, it shouldn’t be permissionless. unauthorized participation can actually threaten a DAO’s resistance to capture as it creates more attack vectors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). while participation by as many community members as possible should be encouraged as an *input* into decision making, the ability to put forward certain proposals, make decisions, and hold positions of trust should be subject to qualifying criteria.\n\n> **daos (the human layer) do not need to be as decentralized as the protocols they are built around (the tech layer)**\n\n## **Emergence**\n\n* **what it means:** *the fact of something becoming known or starting to exist ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/emergence)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in corporations, ideas are dictated from the top down. in daos, initiatives surface organically from the community*\n* **design principle:** *emergent daos don’t have to be amorphous. a strong mission and culture can guide collective decision making without being overly prescriptive*\n\nemergence is vital to maintaining an active community. daos that don’t support emergence become little more than shell communities over time as contributors get frustrated having little ability to influence the dao. the most emergent daos are “day-one daos,” which form organically when groups of people rally around a mission, idea, belief, or event. they’re decentralized from the beginning and decide what to do or build collectively. these daos usually launch tokens immediately as a way to raise funding, which also immediately decentralizes decision making. this provides contributors with full autonomy to shape the dao emergently but day-one daos can struggle to guide decision making given the lack of structure.\n\nlet’s define culture as a set of shared beliefs about how decisions should be made (mission) and which behaviors will be rewarded (values). culture is mostly an afterthought in traditional corporations. decision makers are determined via hierarchy and decisions are implemented by force, so there is little need to define a framework around how decisions get made. In contrast, culture is a critical tool for guiding decisions made by a collective.\n\nwhy are mission statements so important for daos? because they provide a north star for decision making and set a general direction for the dao. directionless daos tend to lose momentum, and i’ve never seen a dao that lost momentum get it back. a strong mission can also create a moat. people think community is a moat but it can’t be since community members are constantly changing. your mission, however, can consistently draw in value-aligned contributors and keep them there when the dream of the dao inevitably fades into the reality of the dao ([twoirtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896203439091729)).\n\ncontributors can only meaningfully contribute to 3–4 daos, so they need a compelling reason to contribute to one over another. RabbitHole contributors have said they work with us specifically because they understand our mission and share our beliefs. this is important because it creates a sense of belonging, which is among the top things contributors

values are the second component of building a strong dao culture. more emergent daos tend to develop around icons, “mimetic filters,” lore, or specific events, which serve as a natural filter to draw in value-aligned contributors. they must then work together to collectively define their mission and values (see [Yearn Blue Pill](https://medium.com/iearn/the-blue-pill-ca44ed01f16f)). the best values make clear which behaviors will be rewarded and which actions should be prioritized over others within the dao (see [example](https://twitter.com/flynnjamm/status/1479485964225503233?s=21)).\n\nmission statements and values can be suggested by a core team (see [CCS](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/16G0rsr1ZzpbnHWNcNSNkY8YEz03jq6nn_5TA1hCmDqQ/mobilebasic), Mirror [1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Um_0l4WkIwEoBMxSCjIxv8xfPe_tJCn6I8eDFHNNIg/edit#slide=id.g102289b1e02_1_403), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1olJhdPN0iP1gxY7DDQfiMr-XwdRIbA-rzID5jqPGuU0/edit), and [3](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17ZCRNLbPSVVBbpUISuTW5uWIu9VJBynE), and [ENS)](https://twitter.com/AlexSlobodnik/status/1470545402554458112) or collectively created by contributors (see [OADAO](https://otherinter.net/research/pooltogether-offchain-report/)). regardless of the process for defining them, establishing a clear mission and values provides emergent daos with just enough guidance about how to make decisions without being overly prescriptive.\n\n## **Complexity**\n\n* **what it means:** *a complex system emerges organically as a result of the behaviors of the components within it, rather than according to a predetermined plan ([Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/impact/defining-complex-system/)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *most corporations are complicated systems, with any complexity tightly controlled by bureaucracy. daos are complex systems, meaning it’s hard to determine the impact actions in advance (more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3555&v=6mwVOp_7TFQ&feature=emb_logo)*)\n* **design principle:** *communities should co-create seasonal charters to guide efforts in a way that accounts for uncertainty while preventing chaos*\n\nsince well designed daos empower contributors to make decisions that can meaningfully change the trajectory of the organization, outcomes are hard to anticipate. that doesn’t mean that daos have to be chaotic. just because we don’t know the exact destination, doesn’t mean we can’t steer at all.\n\nstrategy can exist in daos, the difference relative to corporate strategy is that dao strategy is co-created by contributors rather than set from the top-down. the simplest way to do this is via collectively authored charters (see [here](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Metagovernance-Pod-v0-Charter-FINAL-b289ebc63e44456bae1a17987f1a57b8)) that serve as a mutable guide outlining high-level goals, suggested processes, and guiding principles to inform decision making over a season. these charters maximize contributor scope within a “container,” providing a collectively agreed upon roadmap that defines *what* needs to be accomplished while allowing contributors to determine *how* they arrive at the intended destination. allowing for re-evaluation and updates to charters at regular intervals is important since much of how a dao operates is discovered through day-to-day experience ([twoirrtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896222971879437))\n\n> **while dao visions are collectively discovered over time, dao strategy should be collectively set at regular intervals**\n\nwhile contributors want the ability to shape strategy, i’ve found that they also don’t want to be handed a completely blank slate. at RabbitHole, we found the optimal balance in providing an initial charter outlining \\~70% of what a working group will drive towards and empowering the community to provide feedback and fill in the rest.\n\n## **Agency**\n\n*autonomy is present at the organizational/dao level while agency is present at the individual contributor level*\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to take action or to choose what action to take ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/agency)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in traditional corporations, top level management holds most of the agency. in daos, all network participants maximize agency*\n* **design principle:** *daos need to be designed with the understanding that individual contributors will optimize for agency via voice and exit*\n\n### 1.) Voice (change the system from within)\n\ngovernance gives contributors *the option* to have a voice in decision making. while most governance conversations focus on how to increase voter participation, *having the option* to vote is actually more important than constantly voting. if contributors have the option to effectuate change, but don’t choose it, they have nobody to blame. if they do exercise the option, they feel empowered by the agency to influence their own destiny. since the option is more important than the action, the expectation should *not* be that every tokenholder votes on every vote. most everyday users don’t want to participate in democracy for the products they use each day. even if they wanted to, it’s a full time job to keep up with all proposals and so quorum is usually only met on the most controversial proposals. once we accept that option to vote is more important than the action of voting, we can stop applying a one-size-fits-all decision making model to governance. this will allow us to make more effective decisions, which is one of the two primary purposes of daos (along with collective ownership.)\n\nwhat effective decision making comes down to is empowering high context people to make localized decisions while granting everyone else the option to protest when/if needed. if we design for agency, we can start experimenting more with consent-based governance (see [Mirror 0004](https://dao.mirror.xyz/U91KFBfSmWCjJar4-tflQBSQK1H0IVTOMheSPrHvU0Q)), optimistic governance (see [Aragon](https://aragon.org/aragon-govern) and [Tribe](https://twitter.com/joey__santoro/status/1513555100618264577?s=21&t=KuJC02BF-hTlhp5iqEuJ0g)), and lazy consensus (see [Colony](https://colony.io/)) and we can start to think about differing voting rights based on identity, reputation, and contribution (See [Element](https://medium.com/element-finance/voting-vaults-a-new-defi-and-governance-primitive-b4b2f6289d48?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------)).\n\n![Dan Wu: https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1499859953594642439?cxt=HHwWjsC9rcyrydApAAAA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MNcv3BD01WNjqoSl)\n\n### 2.) Exit (leave to create start a new system or join a competitor)\n\npart of the beauty of daos is the fluidity of participation and the ability to work, on a part-time basis, for multiple daos at once. it also means that exit is an easier option for contributors than it is at a traditional corporation. core teams should be prepared to fill in any gaps created by a primarily part-time contributor base that may frequently choose exit. maintaining continuity of work when turnover is high increases the need for thorough and transparent process documentation and clearly outlined strategies. you probably don’t want to evaluate your dao on retention. instead, focus on ratifying co-created policies and processes that allow any contributor to plug into well defined, yet flexible, and well documented workflows, reducing dependency on any one contributor without adding top-down bureaucracy.\n\n## **Transparency**\n\n* **what it means:** *the quality of being done in an open way without secrets ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/transparency))*\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** daos redefine the meaning of “radical transparency” in a way that would severely rattle private corporations\n* **design principle:** *design for nearly complete transparency and higher levels of accountability relative to traditional organizations*\n\nwhile public corporations make some data transparent, they do so in a highly edited format, released at infrequent intervals. in contrast, all the raw data pertaining to on-chain actions of a dao is publicly viewable, in its entirety, in real time. contributors expect a similar level of transparency for all off-chain data and decision making. providing this level of transparency into off-chain actions is where many daos fall short and run into conflict.\n\nthe purpose of transparency in corporations and daos is also different. the purpose of corporate transparency is *to inform* shareholders about decisions that have already been made. the purpose of dao transparency is *to enable* contributors to make decisions. this makes transparency all the more important in daos as information asymmetry actually prevents contributors from fulfilling their role ([chase chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman)). however, this level of transparency also means that dao operators will be held accountable 24/7. contributors will expect rapid responses and open communication at all times. at the same time, anonymity among the contributor base provides less transparency and lowers accountability. since the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise, it will get rough in the Discord. dao operators need mental health benefits and support. burnout is extremely common among community managers, but it’s also preventable. while complete transparency seems like the simplest property to design for, it has the most underestimated impact on dao operators.\n\n\n---\n\nit’s completely mindblowing what a group of internet strangers can do when empowered by collective ownership and decision making. we can accomplish even more if we start designing daos in a way that embraces their unique properties: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, and Transparency. If these properties will be disruptive to what you’re trying to achieve, a dao might not be the best structure to accomplish your goal. \n\n![](https://twitter.com/lalalavendr/status/1499760045692796929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499760045692796929%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Flalalavendr%2Fstatus%2F1499760045692796929image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\n\n---\n\nwe’re still figuring out what great dao design looks like and we have a long way to go. daos are constantly evolving, so the best approach today may not be the best approach tomorrow. i still believe these design principles are useful, even if we disagree about them, because they start a conversation that hopefully moves us all forward, together, and isn’t that the whole point anyway?\n\n\n---\n\nThanks to [pet3rpan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) for discussions on this topic and for feedback from: [Diana Chen](https://twitter.com/ddwchen), [Chase Chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Meg Lister](https://twitter.com/MegLister), [Ben Schecter](https://twitter.com/benschecter), and [Vishal Kankani](https://twitter.com/kankanivishal)\n\nIf you liked my thoughts on daos, check out my earlier thoughts on [DeFi](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16), [DeFi 2.0](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26), and [Web3 Social](https://justine.mirror.xyz/dQtmHWtUcUsb_-rUtOgc8fzCn5z6lw1cLoMcswykV3I)", "timestamp": 1657241675, "digest": "ITRTe2OKz4BALnDe9vMhzGfrSCS16G-nu6mOaIoNx_o", "contributor": "0x30Cf218b751f0204d906962798d6d6251AE67eF4"}

{"id": "6MiBJFw9py--9J3PF5IL2nJXq5nfe32qfCy3PNzfvnY", "title": "learning by daoing: designing for the unique properties of daos", "body": "at the most basic level, daos are simple. they facilitate two things: collective ownership and collective decision making. it starts to get more complicated when we consider the many ways to design daos. when it comes to designing daos, we spend too much time talking about how each dao is different and not enough time thinking about the ways in which they are the same. this lack of design framework either forces us to resort to traditional companies as a baseline model (porting over many of the limitations of traditional organizations) or to forgo any framework at all and struggle to manage a dao’s evolution. \n\nthrough the (currently painful) process of daoing, i’ve identified several inherent properties common across functional daos. by designing daos with these common properties in mind, we can not only improve the experience of daoing but also design systems that accomplish more than traditional corporations ever have (one example [here](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)).\n\nthese properties are: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, Transparency\n\n\n---\n\n## Autonomy\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to make your own decisions without being controlled by anyone else; the right of an organization, country, or region to be independent and govern itself ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/autonomy)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** in contrast to traditional corporations, daos cannot be controlled or *[captured](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)*\n* **design principle:** *design for the highest degree of autonomy (weakly linked, autonomous sub-daos) while providing checks and balances on distributed power*\n\nthe biggest difference between corporations and daos is that daos can be capture-resistant, meaning they incorporate mechanisms to prevent the capture of shared resources by bad actors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). in traditional corporate structures, capture resistance is weakly ensured via trust and reputation, since both matter in the repeated game of public business. internal capture is prevented via regulations enforced by higher-level, external agencies. daos require different assurances against capture since trust, reputation, and regulation are mostly absent in large, somewhat anonymous, digitally native networks. daos can be designed to be capture-resistant, but most aren’t. there are three main ways a dao can be captured:\n\n### 1.) control over decision making\n\nthe 2020 wave of daos pioneered “[progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/),” or turning control over to a community once a protocol built by a centralized core team achieved product-market-fit. this approach prevents the core team from being distracted by building a community and a product at the same time, and avoids design by committee, which isn’t usually conducive to shipping products. this method **builds community around collective ownership**, launching a token once operations are “sufficiently decentralized” and suddenly turning decision making over to a group of new token holders, usually via token-weighted governance. all decision making has been centralized up to this point and a large portion of product-related decisions often remain centralized. since decision making has been centralized from the start, decentralizing it can feel like giving up control, which core teams are often reluctant to do.\n\ncommunity members are drawn in by a token launch, not by co-building or participating in the network over time, which can create communities that are more speculative in nature. given a lack of other criteria, like previous contributions to the dao, tokens are generally distributed based on retroactive usage, which has proven to be a weak contributor acquisition method. contributors quickly become frustrated by a low degree of involvement in decision making. these dynamics can result in lower voter participation, making any decentralized decision making less capture-resistant as less voices are represented.\n\nregardless of the path towards decentralization, token-weighted governance increases the possibility of capture in the decision making process, the risks of which are well outlined [here](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html). Optimism’s two house governance system is a positive first step towards more capture-resistant governance (more [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/).)\n\n> **for daos to be capture-resistant, we must decouple power (decision making rights) from wealth (token holdings)**\n\n### 2.) control over resources\n\nto avoid some of these challenges, we experimented with a different decentralization method at [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/). our hope was to **build a community around collective decision making**, by inviting contributors to co-create with us much earlier in the decentralization process (pre-token) rather than building a community around collective ownership of an already finished product and token. We involved our community gradually in non-core business operations, spinning up a series of community-led working groups. however, since there was no mechanism for *decentralized* decision making, working groups were still reliant on external stakeholders for access to critical resources (in this case a centralized company, without a governance mechanism). as a result, our working groups were vulnerable to capture and we made the decision to pause this experiment until we could empower working groups with more autonomy.\n\neven when decentralized decision making does exist, the party controlling the resources (ie. parent dao) still has lower context as to the value a working group provides. while working groups may be equipped with their own budgets, they are still subject to a budget allocation process that is outside their control. even with a token to align incentives between a parent dao and a working group, the value a working group adds may not be reflected in the token value of the parent (ie. metagovernance, the value of which is hard to tie back to a core business value.)\n\n> **when one group controls access to resources for another, the relationship becomes adversarial**\n\nwhile working groups help to control and separate scope within a monolithic organization, the higher autonomy design choice is to replace them with multiple sub-daos. autonomous sub-daos allow communities to organize around specific goals with complete autonomy over how to achieve them, to maintain direct ownership over their own resources, and to share directly in any upside generated from their efforts.\n\nthese sub-daos can focus on building either the supply side (to increase the scale/scope of product offerings) or the demand side (to explore new use cases or aggregate users). they may also take the form of a subsidiary, providing services across the ecosystem (ie. metagovernance.) all sub-daos should have economically sustainable business models, so they are not dependent on external parties for resources, but a native token quickly becomes an important means of creating “[weak strategic alignment](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)” between daos via token swaps (more on this method [here](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1505977366991974402); see [MetricsDAO](https://twitter.com/MetricsDAO) and [Goblin Sax](https://twitter.com/goblinsax)).\n\n### 3.) control over execution\n\nthe greatest opportunity for capture occurs at the execution phase. governance generally works as follows (see more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)):\n\n* a proposal is put forward\n* the community votes on a proposal\n* the outcome of the proposal is either autonomously executed on-chain or an off-chain action is executed by a select party\n* execution is verified and / or analyzed by the community\n\nexecution is the phase most vulnerable to capture since nothing prevents those with execution power (ie. multi-sig signers) from ignoring the will of voters and executing whatever actions they choose. this doesn’t mean we should eliminate all positions of trust within daos. there is a common misconception that in order to avoid capture, decentralized organizations must be flat. but daos are leaderful, not leaderless. daos can still have hierarchy, it’s just that it’s fluid.\n\npositions of trust (like those with execution power) should be elected or legitimized by the broader community with clear mechanisms for removal if/when the responsibilities of those positions are abused or neglected. [Yearn’s gov 2.0](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460) proposes such a model, wherein highly autonomous yTeams are empowered by YFI holders to act independently in the best interest of yearn, within a constrained domain of action and discrete decision-making powers, subject to monitoring by YFI holders which have the power to remove contributors if roles are abused (more [here](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460)).\n\n> **being a leader in a dao is the most humbling thing I’ve ever done because you cannot rely on static positional authority. you must constantly earn respect with the community. on the good days, it’s meritocracy; on the bad days, trial by jury.**\n\npositions of trust don’t need to be open to the entire dao. while power should be distributed, it shouldn’t be permissionless. unauthorized participation can actually threaten a DAO’s resistance to capture as it creates more attack vectors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). while participation by as many community members as possible should be encouraged as an *input* into decision making, the ability to put forward certain proposals, make decisions, and hold positions of trust should be subject to qualifying criteria.\n\n> **daos (the human layer) do not need to be as decentralized as the protocols they are built around (the tech layer)**\n\n## **Emergence**\n\n* **what it means:** *the fact of something becoming known or starting to exist ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/emergence)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in corporations, ideas are dictated from the top down. in daos, initiatives surface organically from the community*\n* **design principle:** *emergent daos don’t have to be amorphous. a strong mission and culture can guide collective decision making without being overly prescriptive*\n\nemergence is vital to maintaining an active community. daos that don’t support emergence become little more than shell communities over time as contributors get frustrated having little ability to influence the dao. the most emergent daos are “day-one daos,” which form organically when groups of people rally around a mission, idea, belief, or event. they’re decentralized from the beginning and decide what to do or build collectively. these daos usually launch tokens immediately as a way to raise funding, which also immediately decentralizes decision making. this provides contributors with full autonomy to shape the dao emergently but day-one daos can struggle to guide decision making given the lack of structure.\n\nlet’s define culture as a set of shared beliefs about how decisions should be made (mission) and which behaviors will be rewarded (values). culture is mostly an afterthought in traditional corporations. decision makers are determined via hierarchy and decisions are implemented by force, so there is little need to define a framework around how decisions get made. In contrast, culture is a critical tool for guiding decisions made by a collective.\n\nwhy are mission statements so important for daos? because they provide a north star for decision making and set a general direction for the dao. directionless daos tend to lose momentum, and i’ve never seen a dao that lost momentum get it back. a strong mission can also create a moat. people think community is a moat but it can’t be since community members are constantly changing. your mission, however, can consistently draw in value-aligned contributors and keep them there when the dream of the dao inevitably fades into the reality of the dao ([twoirtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896203439091729)).\n\ncontributors can only meaningfully contribute to 3–4 daos, so they need a compelling reason to contribute to one over another. RabbitHole contributors have said they work with us specifically because they understand our mission and share our beliefs. this is important because it creates a sense of belonging, which is among the top things contributors crave.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\nclear values are the second component of building a strong dao culture. more emergent daos tend to develop around icons, “mimetic filters,” lore, or specific events, which serve as a natural filter to draw in value-aligned contributors. they must then work together to collectively define their mission and values (see [Yearn Blue Pill](https://medium.com/iearn/the-blue-pill-ca44ed01f16f)). the best values make clear which behaviors will be rewarded and which actions should be prioritized over others within the dao (see [example](https://twitter.com/flynnjamm/status/1479485964225503233?s=21)).\n\nmission statements and values can be suggested by a core team (see [CCS](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/16G0rsr1ZzpbnHWNcNSNkY8YEz03jq6nn_5TA1hCmDqQ/mobilebasic), Mirror [1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Um_0l4WkIwEoBMxSCjIxv8xfPe_tJCn6I8eDFHNNIg/edit#slide=id.g102289b1e02_1_403), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1olJhdPN0iP1gxY7DDQfiMr-XwdRIbA-rzID5jqPGuU0/edit), and [3](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17ZCRNLbPSVVBbpUISuTW5uWIu9VJBynE), and [ENS)](https://twitter.com/AlexSlobodnik/status/1470545402554458112) or collectively created by contributors (see [OADAO](https://otherinter.net/research/pooltogether-offchain-report/)). regardless of the process for defining them, establishing a clear mission and values provides emergent daos with just enough guidance about how to make decisions without being overly prescriptive.\n\n## **Complexity**\n\n* **what it means:** *a complex system emerges organically as a result of the behaviors of the components within it, rather than according to a predetermined plan ([Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/impact/defining-complex-system/)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *most corporations are complicated systems, with any complexity tightly controlled by bureaucracy. daos are complex systems, meaning it’s hard to determine the impact actions in advance (more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3555&v=6mwVOp_7TFQ&feature=emb_logo)*)\n* **design principle:** *communities should co-create seasonal charters to guide efforts in a way that accounts for uncertainty while preventing chaos*\n\nsince well designed daos empower contributors to make decisions that can meaningfully change the trajectory of the organization, outcomes are hard to anticipate. that doesn’t mean that daos have to be chaotic. just because we don’t know the exact destination, doesn’t mean we can’t steer at all.\n\nstrategy can exist in daos, the difference relative to corporate strategy is that dao strategy is co-created by contributors rather than set from the top-down. the simplest way to do this is via collectively authored charters (see [here](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Metagovernance-Pod-v0-Charter-FINAL-b289ebc63e44456bae1a17987f1a57b8)) that serve as a mutable guide outlining high-level goals, suggested processes, and guiding principles to inform decision making over a season. these charters maximize contributor scope within a “container,” providing a collectively agreed upon roadmap that defines *what* needs to be accomplished while allowing contributors to determine *how* they arrive at the intended destination. allowing for re-evaluation and updates to charters at regular intervals is important since much of how a dao operates is discovered through day-to-day experience ([twoirrtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896222971879437))\n\n> **while dao visions are collectively discovered over time, dao strategy should be collectively set at regular intervals**\n\nwhile contributors want the ability to shape strategy, i’ve found that they also don’t want to be handed a completely blank slate. at RabbitHole, we found the optimal balance in providing an initial charter outlining \\~70% of what a working group will drive towards and empowering the community to provide feedback and fill in the rest.\n\n## **Agency**\n\n*autonomy is present at the organizational/dao level while agency is present at the individual contributor level*\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to take action or to choose what action to take ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/agency)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in traditional corporations, top level management holds most of the agency. in daos, all network participants maximize agency*\n* **design principle:** *daos need to be designed with the understanding that individual contributors will optimize for agency via voice and exit*\n\n### 1.) Voice (change the system from within)\n\ngovernance gives contributors *the option* to have a voice in decision making. while most governance conversations focus on how to increase voter participation, *having the option* to vote is actually more important than constantly voting. if contributors have the option to effectuate change, but don’t choose it, they have nobody to blame. if they do exercise the option, they feel empowered by the agency to influence their own destiny. since the option is more important than the action, the expectation should *not* be that every tokenholder votes on every vote. most everyday users don’t want to participate in democracy for the products they use each day. even if they wanted to, it’s a full time job to keep up with all proposals and so quorum is usually only met on the most controversial proposals. once we accept that option to vote is more important than the action of voting, we can stop applying a one-size-fits-all decision making model to governance. this will allow us to make more effective decisions, which is one of the two primary purposes of daos (along with collective ownership.)\n\nwhat effective decision making comes down to is empowering high context people to make localized decisions while granting everyone else the option to protest when/if needed. if we design for agency, we can start experimenting more with consent-based governance (see [Mirror 0004](https://dao.mirror.xyz/U91KFBfSmWCjJar4-tflQBSQK1H0IVTOMheSPrHvU0Q)), optimistic governance (see [Aragon](https://aragon.org/aragon-govern) and [Tribe](https://twitter.com/joey__santoro/status/1513555100618264577?s=21&t=KuJC02BF-hTlhp5iqEuJ0g)), and lazy consensus (see [Colony](https://colony.io/)) and we can start to think about differing voting rights based on identity, reputation, and contribution (See [Element](https://medium.com/element-finance/voting-vaults-a-new-defi-and-governance-primitive-b4b2f6289d48?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------)).\n\n![Dan Wu: https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1499859953594642439?cxt=HHwWjsC9rcyrydApAAAA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MNcv3BD01WNjqoSl)\n\n### 2.) Exit (leave to create start a new system or join a competitor)\n\npart of the beauty of daos is the fluidity of participation and the ability to work, on a part-time basis, for multiple daos at once. it also means that exit is an easier option for contributors than it is at a traditional corporation. core teams should be prepared to fill in any gaps created by a primarily part-time contributor base that may frequently choose exit. maintaining continuity of work when turnover is high increases the need for thorough and transparent process documentation and clearly outlined strategies. you probably don’t want to evaluate your dao on retention. instead, focus on ratifying co-created policies and processes that allow any contributor to plug into well defined, yet flexible, and well documented workflows, reducing dependency on any one contributor without adding top-down bureaucracy.\n\n## **Transparency**\n\n* **what it means:** *the quality of being done in an open way without secrets ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/transparency))*\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** daos redefine the meaning of “radical transparency” in a way that would severely rattle private corporations\n* **design principle:** *design for nearly complete transparency and higher levels of accountability relative to traditional organizations*\n\nwhile public corporations make some data transparent, they do so in a highly edited format, released at infrequent intervals. in contrast, all the raw data pertaining to on-chain actions of a dao is publicly viewable, in its entirety, in real time. contributors expect a similar level of transparency for all off-chain data and decision making. providing this level of transparency into off-chain actions is where many daos fall short and run into conflict.\n\nthe purpose of transparency in corporations and daos is also different. the purpose of corporate transparency is *to inform* shareholders about decisions that have already been made. the purpose of dao transparency is *to enable* contributors to make decisions. this makes transparency all the more important in daos as information asymmetry actually prevents contributors from fulfilling their role ([chase chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman)). however, this level of transparency also means that dao operators will be held accountable 24/7. contributors will expect rapid responses and open communication at all times. at the same time, anonymity among the contributor base provides less transparency and lowers accountability. since the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise, it will get rough in the Discord. dao operators need mental health benefits and support. burnout is extremely common among community managers, but it’s also preventable. while complete transparency seems like the simplest property to design for, it has the most underestimated impact on dao operators.\n\n\n---\n\nit’s completely mindblowing what a group of internet strangers can do when empowered by collective ownership and decision making. we can accomplish even more if we start designing daos in a way that embraces their unique properties: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, and Transparency. If these properties will be disruptive to what you’re trying to achieve, a dao might not be the best structure to accomplish your goal. \n\n![this doesn’t mean that daos can’t build products, they can and have, it just means that daos may be far more effective at organizing other types of activities, considering their inherent properties ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/07hzyQ9M06VL24xNYakkc.png?height=307&width=921)\n\nwe’re still figuring out what great dao design looks like and we have a long way to go. daos are constantly evolving, so the best approach today may not be the best approach tomorrow. i still believe these design principles are useful, even if we disagree about them, because they start a conversation that hopefully moves us all forward, together, and isn’t that the whole point anyway?\n\n\n---\n\nThanks to [pet3rpan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) for discussions on this topic and for feedback from: [Diana Chen](https://twitter.com/ddwchen), [Chase Chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Meg Lister](https://twitter.com/MegLister), [Ben Schecter](https://twitter.com/benschecter), and [Vishal Kankani](https://twitter.com/kankanivishal)\n\nIf you liked my thoughts on daos, check out my earlier thoughts on [DeFi](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16), [DeFi 2.0](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26), and [Web3 Social](https://justine.mirror.xyz/dQtmHWtUcUsb_-rUtOgc8fzCn5z6lw1cLoMcswykV3I)", "timestamp": 1657241925, "digest": "ITRTe2OKz4BALnDe9vMhzGfrSCS16G-nu6mOaIoNx_o", "contributor": "0x30Cf218b751f0204d906962798d6d6251AE67eF4"}

We involved our community gradually in non-core business operations, spinning up a series of community-led working groups. however, since there was no mechanism for *decentralized* decision making, working groups were still reliant on external stakeholders for access to critical resources (in this case a centralized company, without a governance mechanism). as a result, our working groups were vulnerable to capture and we made the decision to pause this experiment until we could empower working groups with more autonomy.\n\neven when decentralized decision making does exist, the party controlling the resources (ie. parent dao) still has lower context as to the value a working group provides. while working groups may be equipped with their own budgets, they are still subject to a budget allocation process that is outside their control. even with a token to align incentives between a parent dao and a working group, the value a working group adds may not be reflected in the token value of the parent (ie. metagovernance, the value of which is hard to tie back to a core business value.)\n\n> **when one group controls access to resources for another, the relationship becomes adversarial**\n\nwhile working groups help to control and separate scope within a monolithic organization, the higher autonomy design choice is to replace them with multiple sub-daos. autonomous sub-daos allow communities to organize around specific goals with complete autonomy over how to achieve them, to maintain direct ownership over their own resources, and to share directly in any upside generated from their efforts.\n\nthese sub-daos can focus on building either the supply side (to increase the scale/scope of product offerings) or the demand side (to explore new use cases or aggregate users). they may also take the form of a subsidiary, providing services across the ecosystem (ie. metagovernance.) all sub-daos should have economically sustainable business models, so they are not dependent on external parties for resources, but a native token quickly becomes an important means of creating “[weak strategic alignment](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)” between daos via token swaps (more on this method [here](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1505977366991974402); see [MetricsDAO](https://twitter.com/MetricsDAO) and [Goblin Sax](https://twitter.com/goblinsax)).\n\n### 3.) control over execution\n\nthe greatest opportunity for capture occurs at the execution phase. governance generally works as follows (see more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)):\n\n* a proposal is put forward\n* the community votes on a proposal\n* the outcome of the proposal is either autonomously executed on-chain or an off-chain action is executed by a select party\n* execution is verified and / or analyzed by the community\n\nexecution is the phase most vulnerable to capture since nothing prevents those with execution power (ie. multi-sig signers) from ignoring the will of voters and executing whatever actions they choose. this doesn’t mean we should eliminate all positions of trust within daos. there is a common misconception that in order to avoid capture, decentralized organizations must be flat. but daos are leaderful, not leaderless. daos can still have hierarchy, it’s just that it’s fluid.\n\npositions of trust (like those with execution power) should be elected or legitimized by the broader community with clear mechanisms for removal if/when the responsibilities of those positions are abused or neglected. [Yearn’s gov 2.0](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460) proposes such a model, wherein highly autonomous yTeams are empowered by YFI holders to act independently in the best interest of yearn, within a constrained domain of action and discrete decision-making powers, subject to monitoring by YFI holders which have the power to remove contributors if roles are abused (more [here](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460)).\n\n> **being a leader in a dao is the most humbling thing I’ve ever done because you cannot rely on static positional authority. you must constantly earn respect with the community. on the good days, it’s meritocracy; on the bad days, trial by jury.**\n\npositions of trust don’t need to be open to the entire dao. while power should be distributed, it shouldn’t be permissionless. unauthorized participation can actually threaten a DAO’s resistance to capture as it creates more attack vectors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). while participation by as many community members as possible should be encouraged as an *input* into decision making, the ability to put forward certain proposals, make decisions, and hold positions of trust should be subject to qualifying criteria.\n\n> **daos (the human layer) do not need to be as decentralized as the protocols they are built around (the tech layer)**\n\n## **Emergence**\n\n* **what it means:** *the fact of something becoming known or starting to exist ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/emergence)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in corporations, ideas are dictated from the top down. in daos, initiatives surface organically from the community*\n* **design principle:** *emergent daos don’t have to be amorphous. a strong mission and culture can guide collective decision making without being overly prescriptive*\n\nemergence is vital to maintaining an active community. daos that don’t support emergence become little more than shell communities over time as contributors get frustrated having little ability to influence the dao. the most emergent daos are “day-one daos,” which form organically when groups of people rally around a mission, idea, belief, or event. they’re decentralized from the beginning and decide what to do or build collectively. these daos usually launch tokens immediately as a way to raise funding, which also immediately decentralizes decision making. this provides contributors with full autonomy to shape the dao emergently but day-one daos can struggle to guide decision making given the lack of structure.\n\nlet’s define culture as a set of shared beliefs about how decisions should be made (mission) and which behaviors will be rewarded (values). culture is mostly an afterthought in traditional corporations. decision makers are determined via hierarchy and decisions are implemented by force, so there is little need to define a framework around how decisions get made. In contrast, culture is a critical tool for guiding decisions made by a collective.\n\nwhy are mission statements so important for daos? because they provide a north star for decision making and set a general direction for the dao. directionless daos tend to lose momentum, and i’ve never seen a dao that lost momentum get it back. a strong mission can also create a moat. people think community is a moat but it can’t be since community members are constantly changing. your mission, however, can consistently draw in value-aligned contributors and keep them there when the dream of the dao inevitably fades into the reality of the dao ([twoirtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896203439091729)).\n\ncontributors can only meaningfully contribute to 3–4 daos, so they need a compelling reason to contribute to one over another. RabbitHole contributors have said they work with us specifically because they understand our mission and share our beliefs. this is important because it creates a sense of belonging, which is among the top things contributors crave.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\n![](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\nclear values are the second component of building a strong dao culture. more emergent daos tend to develop around icons, “mimetic filters,” lore, or specific events, which serve as a natural filter to draw in value-aligned contributors. they must then work together to collectively define their mission and values (see [Yearn Blue Pill](https://medium.com/iearn/the-blue-pill-ca44ed01f16f)). the best values make clear which behaviors will be rewarded and which actions should be prioritized over others within the dao (see [example](https://twitter.com/flynnjamm/status/1479485964225503233?s=21)).\n\nmission statements and values can be suggested by a core team (see [CCS](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/16G0rsr1ZzpbnHWNcNSNkY8YEz03jq6nn_5TA1hCmDqQ/mobilebasic), Mirror [1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Um_0l4WkIwEoBMxSCjIxv8xfPe_tJCn6I8eDFHNNIg/edit#slide=id.g102289b1e02_1_403), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1olJhdPN0iP1gxY7DDQfiMr-XwdRIbA-rzID5jqPGuU0/edit), and [3](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17ZCRNLbPSVVBbpUISuTW5uWIu9VJBynE), and [ENS)](https://twitter.com/AlexSlobodnik/status/1470545402554458112) or collectively created by contributors (see [OADAO](https://otherinter.net/research/pooltogether-offchain-report/)). regardless of the process for defining them, establishing a clear mission and values provides emergent daos with just enough guidance about how to make decisions without being overly prescriptive.\n\n## **Complexity**\n\n* **what it means:** *a complex system emerges organically as a result of the behaviors of the components within it, rather than according to a predetermined plan ([Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/impact/defining-complex-system/)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *most corporations are complicated systems, with any complexity tightly controlled by bureaucracy. daos are complex systems, meaning it’s hard to determine the impact actions in advance (more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3555&v=6mwVOp_7TFQ&feature=emb_logo)*)\n* **design principle:** *communities should co-create seasonal charters to guide efforts in a way that accounts for uncertainty while preventing chaos*\n\nsince well designed daos empower contributors to make decisions that can meaningfully change the trajectory of the organization, outcomes are hard to anticipate. that doesn’t mean that daos have to be chaotic. just because we don’t know the exact destination, doesn’t mean we can’t steer at all.\n\nstrategy can exist in daos, the difference relative to corporate strategy is that dao strategy is co-created by contributors rather than set from the top-down. the simplest way to do this is via collectively authored charters (see [here](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Metagovernance-Pod-v0-Charter-FINAL-b289ebc63e44456bae1a17987f1a57b8)) that serve as a mutable guide outlining high-level goals, suggested processes, and guiding principles to inform decision making over a season. these charters maximize contributor scope within a “container,” providing a collectively agreed upon roadmap that defines *what* needs to be accomplished while allowing contributors to determine *how* they arrive at the intended destination. allowing for re-evaluation and updates to charters at regular intervals is important since much of how a dao operates is discovered through day-to-day experience ([twoirrtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896222971879437))\n\n> **while dao visions are collectively discovered over time, dao strategy should be collectively set at regular intervals**\n\nwhile contributors want the ability to shape strategy, i’ve found that they also don’t want to be handed a completely blank slate. at RabbitHole, we found the optimal balance in providing an initial charter outlining \\~70% of what a working group will drive towards and empowering the community to provide feedback and fill in the rest.\n\n## **Agency**\n\n*autonomy is present at the organizational/dao level while agency is present at the individual contributor level*\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to take action or to choose what action to take ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/agency)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in traditional corporations, top level management holds most of the agency. in daos, all network participants maximize agency*\n* **design principle:** *daos need to be designed with the understanding that individual contributors will optimize for agency via voice and exit*\n\n### 1.) Voice (change the system from within)\n\ngovernance gives contributors *the option* to have a voice in decision making. while most governance conversations focus on how to increase voter participation, *having the option* to vote is actually more important than constantly voting. if contributors have the option to effectuate change, but don’t choose it, they have nobody to blame. if they do exercise the option, they feel empowered by the agency to influence their own destiny. since the option is more important than the action, the expectation should *not* be that every tokenholder votes on every vote. most everyday users don’t want to participate in democracy for the products they use each day. even if they wanted to, it’s a full time job to keep up with all proposals and so quorum is usually only met on the most controversial proposals. once we accept that option to vote is more important than the action of voting, we can stop applying a one-size-fits-all decision making model to governance. this will allow us to make more effective decisions, which is one of the two primary purposes of daos (along with collective ownership.)\n\nwhat effective decision making comes down to is empowering high context people to make localized decisions while granting everyone else the option to protest when/if needed. if we design for agency, we can start experimenting more with consent-based governance (see [Mirror 0004](https://dao.mirror.xyz/U91KFBfSmWCjJar4-tflQBSQK1H0IVTOMheSPrHvU0Q)), optimistic governance (see [Aragon](https://aragon.org/aragon-govern) and [Tribe](https://twitter.com/joey__santoro/status/1513555100618264577?s=21&t=KuJC02BF-hTlhp5iqEuJ0g)), and lazy consensus (see [Colony](https://colony.io/)) and we can start to think about differing voting rights based on identity, reputation, and contribution (See [Element](https://medium.com/element-finance/voting-vaults-a-new-defi-and-governance-primitive-b4b2f6289d48?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------)).\n\n![Dan Wu: https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1499859953594642439?cxt=HHwWjsC9rcyrydApAAAA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MNcv3BD01WNjqoSl)\n\n### 2.) Exit (leave to create start a new system or join a competitor)\n\npart of the beauty of daos is the fluidity of participation and the ability to work, on a part-time basis, for multiple daos at once. it also means that exit is an easier option for contributors than it is at a traditional corporation. core teams should be prepared to fill in any gaps created by a primarily part-time contributor base that may frequently choose exit. maintaining continuity of work when turnover is high increases the need for thorough and transparent process documentation and clearly outlined strategies. you probably don’t want to evaluate your dao on retention. instead, focus on ratifying co-created policies and processes that allow any contributor to plug into well defined, yet flexible, and well documented workflows, reducing dependency on any one contributor without adding top-down bureaucracy.\n\n## **Transparency**\n\n* **what it means:** *the quality of being done in an open way without secrets ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/transparency))*\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** daos redefine the meaning of “radical transparency” in a way that would severely rattle private corporations\n* **design principle:** *design for nearly complete transparency and higher levels of accountability relative to traditional organizations*\n\nwhile public corporations make some data transparent, they do so in a highly edited format, released at infrequent intervals. in contrast, all the raw data pertaining to on-chain actions of a dao is publicly viewable, in its entirety, in real time. contributors expect a similar level of transparency for all off-chain data and decision making. providing this level of transparency into off-chain actions is where many daos fall short and run into conflict.\n\nthe purpose of transparency in corporations and daos is also different. the purpose of corporate transparency is *to inform* shareholders about decisions that have already been made. the purpose of dao transparency is *to enable* contributors to make decisions. this makes transparency all the more important in daos as information asymmetry actually prevents contributors from fulfilling their role ([chase chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman)). however, this level of transparency also means that dao operators will be held accountable 24/7. contributors will expect rapid responses and open communication at all times. at the same time, anonymity among the contributor base provides less transparency and lowers accountability. since the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise, it will get rough in the Discord. dao operators need mental health benefits and support. burnout is extremely common among community managers, but it’s also preventable. while complete transparency seems like the simplest property to design for, it has the most underestimated impact on dao operators.\n\n\n---\n\nit’s completely mindblowing what a group of internet strangers can do when empowered by collective ownership and decision making. we can accomplish even more if we start designing daos in a way that embraces their unique properties: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, and Transparency. If these properties will be disruptive to what you’re trying to achieve, a dao might not be the best structure to accomplish your goal. \n\n![this ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/07hzyQ9M06VL24xNYakkc.png?height=307&width=921)\n\nwe’re still figuring out what great dao design looks like and we have a long way to go. daos are constantly evolving, so the best approach today may not be the best approach tomorrow. i still believe these design principles are useful, even if we disagree about them, because they start a conversation that hopefully moves us all forward, together, and isn’t that the whole point anyway?\n\n\n---\n\nThanks to [pet3rpan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) for discussions on this topic and for feedback from: [Diana Chen](https://twitter.com/ddwchen), [Chase Chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Meg Lister](https://twitter.com/MegLister), [Ben Schecter](https://twitter.com/benschecter), and [Vishal Kankani](https://twitter.com/kankanivishal)\n\nIf you liked my thoughts on daos, check out my earlier thoughts on [DeFi](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16), [DeFi 2.0](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26), and [Web3 Social](https://justine.mirror.xyz/dQtmHWtUcUsb_-rUtOgc8fzCn5z6lw1cLoMcswykV3I)", "timestamp": 1657242050, "digest": "ITRTe2OKz4BALnDe9vMhzGfrSCS16G-nu6mOaIoNx_o", "contributor": "0x30Cf218b751f0204d906962798d6d6251AE67eF4"}

the right of an organization, country, or region to be independent and govern itself ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/autonomy)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** in contrast to traditional corporations, daos cannot be controlled or *[captured](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)*\n* **design principle:** *design for the highest degree of autonomy (weakly linked, autonomous sub-daos) while providing checks and balances on distributed power*\n\nthe biggest difference between corporations and daos is that daos can be capture-resistant, meaning they incorporate mechanisms to prevent the capture of shared resources by bad actors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). in traditional corporate structures, capture resistance is weakly ensured via trust and reputation, since both matter in the repeated game of public business. internal capture is prevented via regulations enforced by higher-level, external agencies. daos require different assurances against capture since trust, reputation, and regulation are mostly absent in large, somewhat anonymous, digitally native networks. daos can be designed to be capture-resistant, but most aren’t. there are three main ways a dao can be captured:\n\n### 1.) control over decision making\n\nthe 2020 wave of daos pioneered “[progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/),” or turning control over to a community once a protocol built by a centralized core team achieved product-market-fit. this approach prevents the core team from being distracted by building a community and a product at the same time, and avoids design by committee, which isn’t usually conducive to shipping products. this method **builds community around collective ownership**, launching a token once operations are “sufficiently decentralized” and suddenly turning decision making over to a group of new token holders, usually via token-weighted governance. all decision making has been centralized up to this point and a large portion of product-related decisions often remain centralized. since decision making has been centralized from the start, decentralizing it can feel like giving up control, which core teams are often reluctant to do.\n\ncommunity members are drawn in by a token launch, not by co-building or participating in the network over time, which can create communities that are more speculative in nature. given a lack of other criteria, like previous contributions to the dao, tokens are generally distributed based on retroactive usage, which has proven to be a weak contributor acquisition method. contributors quickly become frustrated by a low degree of involvement in decision making. these dynamics can result in lower voter participation, making any decentralized decision making less capture-resistant as less voices are represented.\n\nregardless of the path towards decentralization, token-weighted governance increases the possibility of capture in the decision making process, the risks of which are well outlined [here](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html). Optimism’s two house governance system is a positive first step towards more capture-resistant governance (more [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/).)\n\n> **for daos to be capture-resistant, we must decouple power (decision making rights) from wealth (token holdings)**\n\n### 2.) control over resources\n\nto avoid some of these challenges, we experimented with a different decentralization method at [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/). our hope was to **build a community around collective decision making**, by inviting contributors to co-create with us much earlier in the decentralization process (pre-token) rather than building a community around collective ownership of an already finished product and token. We involved our community gradually in non-core business operations, spinning up a series of community-led working groups. however, since there was no mechanism for *decentralized* decision making, working groups were still reliant on external stakeholders for access to critical resources (in this case a centralized company, without a governance mechanism). as a result, our working groups were vulnerable to capture and we made the decision to pause this experiment until we could empower working groups with more autonomy.\n\neven when decentralized decision making does exist, the party controlling the resources (ie. parent dao) still has lower context as to the value a working group provides. while working groups may be equipped with their own budgets, they are still subject to a budget allocation process that is outside their control. even with a token to align incentives between a parent dao and a working group, the value a working group adds may not be reflected in the token value of the parent (ie. metagovernance, the value of which is hard to tie back to a core business value.)\n\n> **when one group controls access to resources for another, the relationship becomes adversarial**\n\nwhile working groups help to control and separate scope within a monolithic organization, the higher autonomy design choice is to replace them with multiple sub-daos. autonomous sub-daos allow communities to organize around specific goals with complete autonomy over how to achieve them, to maintain direct ownership over their own resources, and to share directly in any upside generated from their efforts.\n\nthese sub-daos can focus on building either the supply side (to increase the scale/scope of product offerings) or the demand side (to explore new use cases or aggregate users). they may also take the form of a subsidiary, providing services across the ecosystem (ie. metagovernance.) all sub-daos should have economically sustainable business models, so they are not dependent on external parties for resources, but a native token quickly becomes an important means of creating “[weak strategic alignment](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)” between daos via token swaps (more on this method [here](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1505977366991974402); see [MetricsDAO](https://twitter.com/MetricsDAO) and [Goblin Sax](https://twitter.com/goblinsax)).\n\n### 3.) control over execution\n\nthe greatest opportunity for capture occurs at the execution phase. governance generally works as follows (see more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)):\n\n* a proposal is put forward\n* the community votes on a proposal\n* the outcome of the proposal is either autonomously executed on-chain or an off-chain action is executed by a select party\n* execution is verified and / or analyzed by the community\n\nexecution is the phase most vulnerable to capture since nothing prevents those with execution power (ie. multi-sig signers) from ignoring the will of voters and executing whatever actions they choose. this doesn’t mean we should eliminate all positions of trust within daos. there is a common misconception that in order to avoid capture, decentralized organizations must be flat. but daos are leaderful, not leaderless. daos can still have hierarchy, it’s just that it’s fluid.\n\npositions of trust (like those with execution power) should be elected or legitimized by the broader community with clear mechanisms for removal if/when the responsibilities of those positions are abused or neglected. [Yearn’s gov 2.0](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460) proposes such a model, wherein highly autonomous yTeams are empowered by YFI holders to act independently in the best interest of yearn, within a constrained domain of action and discrete decision-making powers, subject to monitoring by YFI holders which have the power to remove contributors if roles are abused (more [here](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460)).\n\n> **being a leader in a dao is the most humbling thing I’ve ever done because you cannot rely on static positional authority. you must constantly earn respect with the community. on the good days, it’s meritocracy; on the bad days, trial by jury.**\n\npositions of trust don’t need to be open to the entire dao. while power should be distributed, it shouldn’t be permissionless. unauthorized participation can actually threaten a DAO’s resistance to capture as it creates more attack vectors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). while participation by as many community members as possible should be encouraged as an *input* into decision making, the ability to put forward certain proposals, make decisions, and hold positions of trust should be subject to qualifying criteria.\n\n> **daos (the human layer) do not need to be as decentralized as the protocols they are built around (the tech layer)**\n\n## **Emergence**\n\n* **what it means:** *the fact of something becoming known or starting to exist ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/emergence)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in corporations, ideas are dictated from the top down. in daos, initiatives surface organically from the community*\n* **design principle:** *emergent daos don’t have to be amorphous. a strong mission and culture can guide collective decision making without being overly prescriptive*\n\nemergence is vital to maintaining an active community. daos that don’t support emergence become little more than shell communities over time as contributors get frustrated having little ability to influence the dao. the most emergent daos are “day-one daos,” which form organically when groups of people rally around a mission, idea, belief, or event. they’re decentralized from the beginning and decide what to do or build collectively. these daos usually launch tokens immediately as a way to raise funding, which also immediately decentralizes decision making. this provides contributors with full autonomy to shape the dao emergently but day-one daos can struggle to guide decision making given the lack of structure.\n\nlet’s define culture as a set of shared beliefs about how decisions should be made (mission) and which behaviors will be rewarded (values). culture is mostly an afterthought in traditional corporations. decision makers are determined via hierarchy and decisions are implemented by force, so there is little need to define a framework around how decisions get made. In contrast, culture is a critical tool for guiding decisions made by a collective.\n\nwhy are mission statements so important for daos? because they provide a north star for decision making and set a general direction for the dao. directionless daos tend to lose momentum, and i’ve never seen a dao that lost momentum get it back. a strong mission can also create a moat. people think community is a moat but it can’t be since community members are constantly changing. your mission, however, can consistently draw in value-aligned contributors and keep them there when the dream of the dao inevitably fades into the reality of the dao ([twoirtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896203439091729)).\n\ncontributors can only meaningfully contribute to 3–4 daos, so they need a compelling reason to contribute to one over another. RabbitHole contributors have said they work with us specifically because they understand our mission and share our beliefs. this is important because it creates a sense of belonging, which is among the top things contributors crave.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\n![](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\nclear values are the second component of building a strong dao culture. more emergent daos tend to develop around icons, “mimetic filters,” lore, or specific events, which serve as a natural filter to draw in value-aligned contributors. they must then work together to collectively define their mission and values (see [Yearn Blue Pill](https://medium.com/iearn/the-blue-pill-ca44ed01f16f)). the best values make clear which behaviors will be rewarded and which actions should be prioritized over others within the dao (see [example](https://twitter.com/flynnjamm/status/1479485964225503233?s=21)).\n\nmission statements and values can be suggested by a core team (see [CCS](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/16G0rsr1ZzpbnHWNcNSNkY8YEz03jq6nn_5TA1hCmDqQ/mobilebasic), Mirror [1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Um_0l4WkIwEoBMxSCjIxv8xfPe_tJCn6I8eDFHNNIg/edit#slide=id.g102289b1e02_1_403), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1olJhdPN0iP1gxY7DDQfiMr-XwdRIbA-rzID5jqPGuU0/edit), and [3](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17ZCRNLbPSVVBbpUISuTW5uWIu9VJBynE), and [ENS)](https://twitter.com/AlexSlobodnik/status/1470545402554458112) or collectively created by contributors (see [OADAO](https://otherinter.net/research/pooltogether-offchain-report/)). regardless of the process for defining them, establishing a clear mission and values provides emergent daos with just enough guidance about how to make decisions without being overly prescriptive.\n\n## **Complexity**\n\n* **what it means:** *a complex system emerges organically as a result of the behaviors of the components within it, rather than according to a predetermined plan ([Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/impact/defining-complex-system/)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *most corporations are complicated systems, with any complexity tightly controlled by bureaucracy. daos are complex systems, meaning it’s hard to determine the impact actions in advance (more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3555&v=6mwVOp_7TFQ&feature=emb_logo)*)\n* **design principle:** *communities should co-create seasonal charters to guide efforts in a way that accounts for uncertainty while preventing chaos*\n\nsince well designed daos empower contributors to make decisions that can meaningfully change the trajectory of the organization, outcomes are hard to anticipate. that doesn’t mean that daos have to be chaotic. just because we don’t know the exact destination, doesn’t mean we can’t steer at all.\n\nstrategy can exist in daos, the difference relative to corporate strategy is that dao strategy is co-created by contributors rather than set from the top-down. the simplest way to do this is via collectively authored charters (see [here](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Metagovernance-Pod-v0-Charter-FINAL-b289ebc63e44456bae1a17987f1a57b8)) that serve as a mutable guide outlining high-level goals, suggested processes, and guiding principles to inform decision making over a season. these charters maximize contributor scope within a “container,” providing a collectively agreed upon roadmap that defines *what* needs to be accomplished while allowing contributors to determine *how* they arrive at the intended destination. allowing for re-evaluation and updates to charters at regular intervals is important since much of how a dao operates is discovered through day-to-day experience ([twoirrtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896222971879437))\n\n> **while dao visions are collectively discovered over time, dao strategy should be collectively set at regular intervals**\n\nwhile contributors want the ability to shape strategy, i’ve found that they also don’t want to be handed a completely blank slate. at RabbitHole, we found the optimal balance in providing an initial charter outlining \\~70% of what a working group will drive towards and empowering the community to provide feedback and fill in the rest.\n\n## **Agency**\n\n*autonomy is present at the organizational/dao level while agency is present at the individual contributor level*\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to take action or to choose what action to take ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/agency)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in traditional corporations, top level management holds most of the agency. in daos, all network participants maximize agency*\n* **design principle:** *daos need to be designed with the understanding that individual contributors will optimize for agency via voice and exit*\n\n### 1.) Voice (change the system from within)\n\ngovernance gives contributors *the option* to have a voice in decision making. while most governance conversations focus on how to increase voter participation, *having the option* to vote is actually more important than constantly voting. if contributors have the option to effectuate change, but don’t choose it, they have nobody to blame. if they do exercise the option, they feel empowered by the agency to influence their own destiny. since the option is more important than the action, the expectation should *not* be that every tokenholder votes on every vote. most everyday users don’t want to participate in democracy for the products they use each day. even if they wanted to, it’s a full time job to keep up with all proposals and so quorum is usually only met on the most controversial proposals. once we accept that option to vote is more important than the action of voting, we can stop applying a one-size-fits-all decision making model to governance. this will allow us to make more effective decisions, which is one of the two primary purposes of daos (along with collective ownership.)\n\n![](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1488584926903607300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1488584926903607300%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fchaserchapman%2Fstatus%2F1488584926903607300image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\nwhat effective decision making comes down to is empowering high context people to make localized decisions while granting everyone else the option to protest when/if needed. if we design for agency, we can start experimenting more with consent-based governance (see [Mirror 0004](https://dao.mirror.xyz/U91KFBfSmWCjJar4-tflQBSQK1H0IVTOMheSPrHvU0Q)), optimistic governance (see [Aragon](https://aragon.org/aragon-govern) and [Tribe](https://twitter.com/joey__santoro/status/1513555100618264577?s=21&t=KuJC02BF-hTlhp5iqEuJ0g)), and lazy consensus (see [Colony](https://colony.io/)) and we can start to think about differing voting rights based on identity, reputation, and contribution (See [Element](https://medium.com/element-finance/voting-vaults-a-new-defi-and-governance-primitive-b4b2f6289d48?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------)).\n\n![Dan Wu: https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1499859953594642439?cxt=HHwWjsC9rcyrydApAAAA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MNcv3BD01WNjqoSl)\n\n### 2.) Exit (leave to create start a new system or join a competitor)\n\npart of the beauty of daos is the fluidity of participation and the ability to work, on a part-time basis, for multiple daos at once. it also means that exit is an easier option for contributors than it is at a traditional corporation. core teams should be prepared to fill in any gaps created by a primarily part-time contributor base that may frequently choose exit. maintaining continuity of work when turnover is high increases the need for thorough and transparent process documentation and clearly outlined strategies. you probably don’t want to evaluate your dao on retention. instead, focus on ratifying co-created policies and processes that allow any contributor to plug into well defined, yet flexible, and well documented workflows, reducing dependency on any one contributor without adding top-down bureaucracy.\n\n## **Transparency**\n\n* **what it means:** *the quality of being done in an open way without secrets ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/transparency))*\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** daos redefine the meaning of “radical transparency” in a way that would severely rattle private corporations\n* **design principle:** *design for nearly complete transparency and higher levels of accountability relative to traditional organizations*\n\nwhile public corporations make some data transparent, they do so in a highly edited format, released at infrequent intervals. in contrast, all the raw data pertaining to on-chain actions of a dao is publicly viewable, in its entirety, in real time. contributors expect a similar level of transparency for all off-chain data and decision making. providing this level of transparency into off-chain actions is where many daos fall short and run into conflict.\n\nthe purpose of transparency in corporations and daos is also different. the purpose of corporate transparency is *to inform* shareholders about decisions that have already been made. the purpose of dao transparency is *to enable* contributors to make decisions. this makes transparency all the more important in daos as information asymmetry actually prevents contributors from fulfilling their role ([chase chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman)). however, this level of transparency also means that dao operators will be held accountable 24/7. contributors will expect rapid responses and open communication at all times. at the same time, anonymity among the contributor base provides less transparency and lowers accountability. since the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise, it will get rough in the Discord. dao operators need mental health benefits and support. burnout is extremely common among community managers, but it’s also preventable. while complete transparency seems like the simplest property to design for, it has the most underestimated impact on dao operators.\n\n\n---\n\nit’s completely mindblowing what a group of internet strangers can do when empowered by collective ownership and decision making. we can accomplish even more if we start designing daos in a way that embraces their unique properties: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, and Transparency. If these properties will be disruptive to what you’re trying to achieve, a dao might not be the best structure to accomplish your goal. \n\n![this ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/07hzyQ9M06VL24xNYakkc.png?height=307&width=921)\n\nwe’re still figuring out what great dao design looks like and we have a long way to go. daos are constantly evolving, so the best approach today may not be the best approach tomorrow. i still believe these design principles are useful, even if we disagree about them, because they start a conversation that hopefully moves us all forward, together, and isn’t that the whole point anyway?\n\n\n---\n\nThanks to [pet3rpan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) for discussions on this topic and for feedback from: [Diana Chen](https://twitter.com/ddwchen), [Chase Chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Meg Lister](https://twitter.com/MegLister), [Ben Schecter](https://twitter.com/benschecter), and [Vishal Kankani](https://twitter.com/kankanivishal)\n\nIf you liked my thoughts on daos, check out my earlier thoughts on [DeFi](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16), [DeFi 2.0](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26), and [Web3 Social](https://justine.mirror.xyz/dQtmHWtUcUsb_-rUtOgc8fzCn5z6lw1cLoMcswykV3I)", "timestamp": 1657242212, "digest": "ITRTe2OKz4BALnDe9vMhzGfrSCS16G-nu6mOaIoNx_o", "contributor": "0x30Cf218b751f0204d906962798d6d6251AE67eF4"}

This article outlines the evolution of DeFi through the lens of each.\n\nThis article outlines *financial* *primitives,* or the core building blocks of financial markets, which are distinct from *software* or *cryptographic primitives.* This article assumes some knowledge of finance, crypto, and DeFi and is not comprehensive in its coverage of protocols.\n\n## Financial Primitive 1: Liquidity\n\n*Almost everything comes down to [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp), but we consistently underestimate its importance. Higher liquidity results in tighter spreads and greater [market efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp#:\\~:text=Market%20efficiency%20refers%20to%20the,undervalued%20or%20overvalued%20securities%20available.). Lower liquidity exaggerates market movements and amplifies sell-offs. It creates a flywheel on the way up but a cliff on the way down.*\n\nv1 DeFi was a liquidity vacuum that relied on captive capital. The term captive capital refers to underutilized capital locked in protocols or inefficiently allocated within them. It results in opportunity costs as this capital could otherwise earn higher returns, either inside or outside of the protocol. The first DeFi protocols depended on captive capital: [MakerDAO ](https://makerdao.com/en/)required a minimum 150% collateralization ratio, lending protocols had not yet embraced [superfluid collateral](https://tokeneconomy.co/superfluid-collateral-in-open-finance-8c3db15efac) (a v2 innovation led by [Compound](https://compound.finance/)), and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)’s liquidity was inefficiently distributed across a -∞ to ∞ price curve.\n\n> ***The opportunity cost of captive capital scaled along with DeFi and now v2s and v3s are fighting to achieve greater capital efficiency.***\n\n### Collateral as Liquidity\n\nStablecoins play an enormous role in DeFi. Fiat-backed stablecoins are problematic (centralization, regulation, potential competition from CBDCs) and cryptocollateralized stablecoins present the most viable alternative. However, v1s relied on overcollateralization to maintain their peg and haven’t been able to scale. Purely algorithmic, uncollateralized stablecoins have never performed as intended and v2 attempts seem subject to the same shortcomings (incentive mechanisms that perform well above the peg, but not below).\n\nMany of the latest iterations of stablecoins ([FEI](https://fei.money/), [OHM](https://olympusdao.eth.link/#/), [FLOAT](https://www.floatprotocol.com/#/stake), **[FRAX](https://frax.finance/)**) leverage protocol controlled value (PCV). This is a concept in which the collateral backing a stablecoin is not redeemable by users but rather is owned by the protocol (which decides whether/how to invest it, can use it to restore the peg, etc.) This is similar to a treasury or insurance fund, but is distinct in that PCV can be immediately converted into liquidity (an [AMM](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers) pool). Launch issues aside, [FEI](https://fei.money/)’s PCV enabled it to become the largest liquidity provider (LP) on [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/). [Aave](https://docs.aave.com/faq/swap-and-repay-with-collateral-v2#:\\~:text=In%20Aave%20V2%20you%20have,loans%20with%20your%20deposited%20collateral.) v2 similarly blurs the line between collateral and liquidity by allowing borrowers to pay off their debt with existing collateral. [Proof of Liquidity](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/5/22/proof-of-liquidity) creates a similar dynamic for staking derivatives, which are covered in more detail below.\n\n> ***DeFi v1 figured out how to use liquidity as collateral (LP tokens). v2 and v3 protocols are figuring out how to convert collateral into liquidity.***\n\nUnfortunately, liquidity alone does not result in stability. The real reason stablecoins collapse is a crisis of confidence below the peg. Addressing captive capital is not sufficient. Sound economic mechanisms are required to keep the stablecoin near its peg over time, and mechanism design is hard. Purely algorithmic stablecoins ([Basis Cash](https://basis.cash/), [Empty Set Dollar](https://www.emptyset.finance/)) have struggled with mechanisms that require confidence in the future peg exactly when the present peg is failing. So-called [Direct Incentives](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/what-you-should-know-about-fei-3ccffd4a4bb6), which penalize trades away from the peg and reward trades towards the peg, end up pulling liquidity out of the system at the exact moment it’s most needed.¹⁰ Severe sell penalties mimic constrained liquidity and keep more capital captive, which is the problem we’re trying to solve in the first place. Other models attempt to solve for confidence first and improve capital efficiency over time, beginning with a fully collateralized token and letting the market adjust the collateralization ratio dynamically. As confidence goes up, so does capital efficiency. [FRAX](https://frax.finance/) uses this model, but is currently backed by a basket of fiat-backed stablecoins. While the mechanism appears to be working, it’s unclear how it would hold up were it exclusively collateralized by uncensorable assets.\n\n> ***While the newest generation of stablecoins are focused on lowering collateralization requirements, we need to solve for confidence in the peg (effective mechanism design) before capital efficiency.***\n\n### Liquidity as a Liability\n\nWe can’t talk about liquidity without talking about [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), the dominant AMM. Uniswap played an important role in the rise of [yield farming](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-yield-farming-comp-token-explained) and [liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641#:\\~:text=Liquidity%20mining%20is%20a%20network,for%20that%20protocol%27s%20native%20token.), which, in turn, played an important role in Uniswap’s trajectory. After we learned ([the hard way](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/sushiswaps-vampire-scheme-hours-away)) that [liquidity is not a moat](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/fork-defense-strategies-in-defi/), the focus moved from acquiring it to retaining it. Competing AMMs began moving up the stack to add higher moat/margin services like lending ([Kashi Lending](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/introducing-kashi-lending-margin-trading-on-sushiswaps-bentobox-eb91286f6910)), borrowing a page from traditional fintech: acquire users cheaply and upsell credit products. Instead, Uniswap fundamentally rethought the AMM liquidity mechanism, resulting in a v3 that improves capital efficiency by up to 4000x, in special cases.⁷\n\nWhile v1 AMMs were a [0 to 1 innovation](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/constant-function-market-makers-defis-zero-to-one-innovation-968f77022159), they were also inefficient since they required liquidity for prices that might never be reached. For example, if ETH were in the $200 range, and there was $10M in an ETH/DAI pool, up to 25% of the liquidity pool might exist for buying ETH below $10 or above $5,000.⁵ In this example, it is highly unlikely that liquidity would be needed at those levels. Maintaining this constant price curve resulted in low turnover (\\~20%) as $5B in locked capital translates to only $1B in volume.¹ The even spread of liquidity over the entire range also means that very little liquidity is concentrated where a pair does most of its trading. [Curve](https://curve.fi/) recognized this early on, creating an AMM specifically for stablecoins, which are designed to trade in a tight range.\n\nUniswap v3 addresses these issues and, in the process, moves closer to a limit order book in that LPs can now specify a price range over which to provide liquidity (ie. ETH/USDC from $1800 to $2200). This change should result in almost all trading occurring in a few buckets around the mid-market price, improving liquidity where it’s most needed. More concentrated liquidity should also reduce inventory risk, which results in both wasted capital and exposure to assets that LPs don’t want to hold. For example, if an LP posts $500 for an ETH/DAI pair but is confident that the ETH price will go up, then they’ve taken on exposure to an asset (DAI) that they don’t want to hold (ETH opportunity cost) and are holding $500 of DAI only to buy ETH as it falls, which they think is unlikely. Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity provision reduces this risk by enabling LPs to significantly increase their exposure to preferred assets.¹³ [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) v2 also attempts to reduce inventory risk by introducing [Asset Managers](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-partners-with-aave-to-build-the-first-v2-asset-manager-d9c173330151), which allow LPs to lend out one side of a pair when it’s not being used as swap liquidity. [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [Stablecredit](https://docs.yearn.finance/r-and-d/stablecredit) utilizes a similar functionality.\n\n> ***The next generation of AMMs require less capital but result in more liquidity.***\n\n### Liquidity Trade-offs\n\n[Superfluid collateral](https://tokeneconomy.co/superfluid-collateral-in-open-finance-8c3db15efac) is a v1 concept that refers to the ability to tokenize locked capital (collateral or liquidity) in order to access liquidity or gain leverage on that capital. Staking derivatives extend this concept to staked assets (assets that secure [proof-of-stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp) networks) via stake tokens ([stETH](https://lido.fi/), [rtokens](https://www.stafi.io/rToken)) that essentially allow staked capital to be deployed more productively elsewhere. Proponents of staking derivatives argue that without them, network token liquidity will suffer as a large portion of outstanding supply will remain captive. There are also concerns that validators won’t be incentivized to stake if/when they can earn higher returns on capital deposited elsewhere (DeFi protocols). In theory, staking derivatives could increase the percentage of ETH staked from 15–30% to 80–100%, since it removes the additional costs of staking compared to not staking.¹⁴\n\nStaking derivatives also allow for the creation of new financial instruments. For example, the cash flows “guaranteed” by proof-of-stake rewards can enable products that look similar to coupon-bearing bonds ([Terra](https://terra.money/)’s bAssets, [Blockswap](https://www.blockswap.network/)). These instruments can be used to generate sustainable, stable, and relatively high yields (as in [Anchor Protocol](https://anchorprotocol.com/)), which may onboard more mainstream users to DeFi.\n\nHowever, staked assets are unique from collateral in that they are not just a promise to pay, but rather they are a security mechanism. I would like to see more research on the associated security costs, but it’s clear that design matters. Some designs, particularly those that enable staking derivatives to move cross-chain, allow for a transformation of risk (from [endogenous](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenous-variable.asp) to [exogenous](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenous-variable.asp)) that could impact the underlying game theory that helps secure public networks.¹¹ In contrast, [Proof of Liquidity](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/5/22/proof-of-liquidity) converts staked capital into liquidity for the underlying network token in a way that balances capital efficiency and network security, which should be the main priority.\n\n## Financial Primitive 2: Leverage\n\n*[Leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) amplifies gains (it’s the ultimate in capital efficiency) but also dramatically accelerates losses. Creating leverage is easy, controlling it is hard. We love it, until we hate it.*\n\nThere have been countless TradFi market crashes due to excessive and/or hidden leverage. In the last six months alone, we saw the market impact of [Archegos](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/leveraged-blowout-how-hwang-s-archegos-blindsided-global-banks) (which was highly levered) and the Gamestop levered short squeeze ([140% of Gamestop’s float was sold short](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qjp3jmnxyf73/Short-Sellers-Still-Love-to-Hate-GameStop#:\\~:text=About%2033%20percent%20of%20GSX%27s,added%20during%20the%20past%20week.)). In the crypto markets, we recently saw [$10B in liquidations in 24 hours](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-futures-saw-record-10b-worth-of-liquidations-on-sunday#:\\~:text=31%20a.m.%20PDT-,Crypto%20Futures%20Saw%20Record%20%2410B%20Worth%20of%20Liquidations%20on,caught%20overleveraged%20traders%20off%20guard.), in part due to [cascading liquidations](https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda/status/1238306312229761025) of leveraged long positions. This served as a sort of stress test for the crypto markets, and some DeFi protocols were [pretty stressed](https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1383655305058217988).\n\n> ***Leverage is easy in DeFi , controlling it is still hard.***\n\n### Creating Leverage\n\nMuch of the frenzied activity during the DeFi Summer of 2020 was driven by active leverage strategies that relied on recursive [yield farming](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-yield-farming-comp-token-explained) and [liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641). While this activity has died down since then, we are starting to see new leverage mechanisms emerge. [Element](https://element.fi/)’s [Yield Token Compounding](https://medium.com/element-finance/unlocking-capital-efficiency-a-defi-users-journey-through-element-d0a689f2a894) is one example. When a user deposits collateral via Element, two tokens are minted: a principal token and a yield token. Let’s say a user deposited principal of 10 ETH at 20% APY. The token holder can sell the principal token at a discount. At a fixed rate yield of 10%, they would receive 9 ETH while maintaining exposure to the interest paid on all 10 ETH over time via the yield token. The user could then open a new position with the remaining 9 ETH and repeat, achieving up to 6.5x leverage.³ The ability to earn interest on the *full* principal amount, while being able to access the loan’s [NPV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp), is unique relative to earlier lending protocols.\n\nWhile there have been several protocols that aimed to achieve undercollateralized lending in DeFi, it remains mostly conceptual. While [CREAM](https://app.cream.finance/) v2 strives to achieve zero-collateral protocol-to-protocol lending via the [Iron Bank](https://creamdotfinance.medium.com/introducing-the-iron-bank-bab9417c9a), it’s only available to whitelisted partners and parameters will be determined directly by the CREAM team, highlighting current limitations. Instead, [Alchemix](https://alchemix.fi/) approaches the problem from a completely different angle, allowing borrowers to benefit from overcollateralization. For example, a user that deposits 1000 DAI can access 500 alUSD. The 1000 DAI is put into a Yearn vault to earn yield, which is used to pay down the loan over time. The alternative would be to make an upfront purchase of $500 and then invest the unspent $500, which will obviously earn less yield than $1000 would ($280 less, assuming a 25% APY over 2 years).¹⁵ Again, borrowers benefit from earning interest on the \\*full \\*principal amount while still being able to access a discounted portion of the principal.\n\n> ***New lending protocols utilize the time value of money and the separation of principal and yield to allow users to benefit from (over)collateralization.***\n\n### Cross-Collateral Complexity\n\nWhile the early DeFi ecosystem relied mostly on recursive loops denominated in one asset (ETH), v2s expanded the complexity of lending protocols by allowing for multi-collateral systems, in which *n* assets can be borrowed against *m* collateral. Single-Collateral Dai evolved into Multi-Collateral Dai, [Compound](https://compound.finance/) supported cross-collateral money markets, which [Aave](https://aave.com/) and [CREAM](https://app.cream.finance/) expanded on by supporting more and more assets. [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [StableCredit](https://medium.com/iearn/introducing-stablecredit-a-new-protocol-for-decentralized-lending-stablecoins-and-amms-7252a43ee56) protocol allows users to mint synthetic debt positions to essentially swap collateral ([functionality](https://docs.aave.com/faq/swap-and-repay-with-collateral-v2#:\\~:text=In%20Aave%20V2%20you%20have,loans%20with%20your%20deposited%20collateral.) which Aave v2 supports via [flash loans](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-a-flash-loan)). Some protocols take it a step further and pool exposure to all of these assets, spreading counterparty risk across users. On [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), when the value of any synthetic asset minted on the protocol increases, it raises the value of total debt in the system, while a user’s ownership of the total debt pool remains constant. This can result in outcomes where a user’s debt balance increases due to a price increase of an asset to which they have no direct exposure.² This cross-collateral complexity and cross-asset exposure improves functionality but also increases the likelihood of market contagion, whereby a sell-off in one asset causes a sell-off in others.\n\n### Controlling Leverage\n\nComposability enables rapid innovation, but it also means that money legos can quickly become money dominos. Despite on-chain transparency, the difficulty of creating a cohesive view of leverage compounded across protocols means there is currently no easy way to understand how much credit is [commodity credit versus circulation credit](https://mises.org/wire/mises-explains-difference-between-circulation-credit-and-commodity-credit),⁹ which has implications for the solvency of the system. Solvency is particularly important in a system that, by design, has no lender of last resort. Additionally, while centralized venues liquidate underwater collateral themselves, avoiding counterparty risk, decentralized protocols rely on third-party liquidators to remove underwater debt from their balance sheets. These liquidators can choose to purchase underwater collateral from the protocol at a discount, but they can also choose not to, due to volatility, network congestion, and/or other market factors.¹² [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) attempts to overcome this issue by creating a pool of funds that can be used for liquidations. In this model, LPs agree in advance that their liquidity will be used to buy collateral at a discount during liquidation periods. While this enables the protocol to lower loan collateralization ratios to 110% and offer a fixed rate of 0% interest, LPs could end up buying collateral as prices are falling, which could come at a much higher cost.\n\n## Financial Primitive 3: Risk\n\n*There is one ratio that is nearly inescapable in finance: risk/reward. The idea is simple: higher returns require more risk. With one exception (financial primitive 4), it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to break this ratio.*\n\nWhen markets are new, risk is mostly expressed in binary terms: [risk-on or risk-off](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-on-risk-off.asp). As markets evolve, and the composition of risk is better understood, risk transfer mechanisms develop, as does a sliding scale of risk that allows market participants to express individual risk tolerance.\n\n### Binary Risk\n\nVolatility products allow market participants to take a binary view on market risk and are a critical piece of market infrastructure. The [VIX](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp), an index representing the market’s estimate of future volatility, is a cornerstone of traditional financial markets. CeFi markets already offer some vol products ([FTX ](https://about.ftx.com/)[MOVE](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033136331-MOVE-contracts)), but DeFi markets have few equivalents. Protocols like [Volmex](https://volmex.finance/) are working to create a volatility index while [Benchmark Protocol](https://benchmarkprotocol.finance/)’s stablecoin uses the VIX as an input to its stability mechanism. [INDEX Coop](https://www.indexcoop.com/) seems like a natural candidate for a DeFi native volatility index and [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/#/trade?options=eth) [has expressed interest](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9sS21RREc5Ug/episode/YjEzNDIzMGEtY2JkYi00OTQ2LTkzMDctZjM5NzlmODg2NTQ4?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjDiaX984rwAhUITawKHWA3B6AQjrkEegQIAxAL&ep=6) in creating a “DeFi VIX” as well.\n\n### Risk on a Sliding Scale\n\nEmerging DeFi protocols are developing “risk-matching engines” to pair market participants that prefer less risk with those that prefer more. Most are approaching this via multi-token systems that separate speculative versus non-speculative aspects of a protocol and redistribute cash flows accordingly ([Saffron](https://saffron.finance/), [BarnBridge](https://barnbridge.com/), [Element](https://element.fi/)). For example, [Element](https://element.fi/) splits principal and yield, allowing users to purchase the NPV of the principal (basically a zero-coupon bond) or take up to 10x leveraged exposure to the yield.⁸ [BarnBridge](https://barnbridge.com/) splits cash flows into fixed yield and variable yield. Variable yield holders get upside above a fixed rate but subsidize the fixed yield token holders in the case of a shortfall. Similarly, [Saffron](https://saffron.finance/) splits risk into senior and junior tranches. Senior tranches except lower yields in exchange for coverage from junior tranches in the event that things go south. More yield = more risk.\n\nThese programmable risk protocols enable peer-to-peer risk transfer and allow users to bet on different parts of the capital structure. Risk-averse capital (like corporate treasuries) may prefer to buy the senior tranche, while [Degens](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/degen) chasing yield may prefer junior tranches. Greater expressivity of risk tolerance is a positive development for DeFi markets and there is nothing inherently dangerous about tranching.\n\n> ***Risk tranches have become toxic in the past, namely when they’ve tried to circumvent the risk/reward ratio. The [CDO²](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo2.asp) will forever be my favorite example of clever financial engineering, packaged to look like a riskless instrument when it was actually full of risk.***\n\n## Financial Primitive 4: Arbitrage\n\n*There is one important exception to the risk/reward ratio and that is [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp). Arbitrage creates (theoretically) riskless profit opportunities and it plays a critical role in price discovery, **which** is one of the things smart contract platforms are best suited for.⁴ The [Kimchi premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kimchi-premium.asp) is a perfect example. Buy an asset for $55,000 in the U.S. and sell the same asset for $65,000 in South Korea. Riskless profit.*\n\nArbitrage is required for many DeFi protocols to function properly and needs to be considered in the design of any protocol. [Uniswap ](https://uniswap.org/)is heavily reliant on arbitrageurs to maintain price discovery. Arbitrageurs rebalance portfolios on [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/). Some [argu](https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484)e that [MakerDAO’s ](https://makerdao.com/en/)scale is limited due to the infeasibility of arbitraging [CDP](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateralized-debt-position-cdp)s. Miners on [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co/) are incentivized to mine on the chain by arbitraging the BTC-STX rate.⁶ [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [StableCredit](https://docs.yearn.finance/r-and-d/stablecredit) relies on arbitrage rather than governance to maintain stability in the system. [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ParaSwap](https://paraswap.io/#/), and [Rari](https://rari.capital/) can all be used as vehicles for arbitrage. [ThorChain](https://thorchain.org/) and [Serum](https://dex.projectserum.com/#/market/AtNnsY1AyRERWJ8xCskfz38YdvruWVJQUVXgScC1iPb) will be crucial to enabling cross-chain arbitrage as DeFi protocols launch across Layer 1s. As DeFi struggles to scale, avoidance of gas costs will present a temporary arbitrage opportunity, which is increasingly shaping v2/v3 design ([Aave](https://aave.com/) v2 [collateral swaps](https://medium.com/aave/the-aave-protocol-v2-f06f299cee04), [dydx](https://dydx.exchange/)’s gasless order book, [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) v2s pooled assets, [Sushiswap](https://sushi.com/)’s [BentoBox](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/introducing-kashi-lending-margin-trading-on-sushiswaps-bentobox-eb91286f6910)).\n\n> ***v1s focused on cross-protocol arbitrage, v2s/v3s are focusing on chain-cross arbitrage***\n\nArbitrage increases [market efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp) (the degree to which market prices reflect all available, relevant information) but it also results in narrower spreads and normalized yields, eliminating temporary advantages between protocols. As market efficiency increases, so does competition. True protocol innovation, and not just incrementalism, will be required to maintain dominance in this environment.\n\n\n---\n\nv2 and v3 DeFi protocols will need to innovate across all four financial primitives, as their interconnected nature is what drives markets. Without arbitrage, stablecoins can’t scale. Without liquidity, there is no ability to arbitrage. Leverage lets you take more risk, and risk transfer can let you take on more leverage. Importantly, DeFi enables entirely new financial primitives, such as flash loans, that have no traditional counterpart. Protocols that solve for all of these primitives, and/or that create novel ones, will lead the way for the next generation of DeFi. I can’t wait to see v4 and v5.\n\n\n---\n\nCompare to my earlier thoughts on [DeFi: What it Is and Isn’t](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16) and get in [touch](https://twitter.com/j_humenansky)! \n\nThank you to [Alex Pruden](https://medium.com/u/e1ca31caefb9?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------), [Eddy Lazzarin](https://medium.com/u/2051feec12f2?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------), [Dmitriy Berenzon](https://medium.com/u/a25f7c81672d?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------) and [Luca Cosentino](https://medium.com/u/effdd16050cd?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------) for feedback**.** \n\n## References\n\n 1.

{"id": "2qFGa88n1wjxvbEXqha0Aep-1iQso54yUVSnOd3_Q9w", "title": "The MLKJrdrop", "body": "> ***Advocate for the Elondrop and help America get to the promised land that Martin Luther King Jr. intuited, but did not have the political support to reach.***\n\nNow that Balaji has established [the mechanism for global freedom and prosperity](https://balajis.com/elondrop/), it’s important to explain the historical significance of the Elondrop.\n\nThe Elondrop is what Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK Jr.) wanted but couldn’t have. It’s the reason he was in Memphis the day he was assassinated. MLK Jr. - and the sanitation workers he was scheduled to march with - could not go global in the way that Elon has the ability to.\n\nThe campaign that Balaji says Elon must continue, is ***version 2.0*** of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “*Poor People’s Campaign.”*\n\nKing believed addressing poverty was the next chapter in the struggle for genuine equality. That’s what the *“[Poor People’s Campaign](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/poor-peoples-campaign)”* was all about.\n\nThe campaign for economic prosperity held by King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) did not succeed to the scale that Twittercoin could, because Web3 technology did not exist.\n\nThis fact is the reason why [King’s Net Promoter Score (NPS) was so low during his lifetime](https://news.gallup.com/poll/20920/martin-luther-king-jr-revered-more-after-death-than-before.aspx). A coin will help Elon align the interests of Twitter’s users, says Balaji. In the same way that Twitter is full of quarreling accounts that are not aligned in their desires; America in the final year of King’s life was highly polarized. The MLKdrop might have saved him.\n\nIf we place the respect on the legacy of MLK Jr. that we claim to, then we should do everything in our power to not only ensure that the Elondrop takes place, but we should document the steps taken; tools used; reasons for why the drop should take place, and why it was successful.\n\nWe should also advocate for the Elondrop. It will and should be the first of many airdrops of its kind.\n\nThe sheer size of a release of a coin for Twitter would be the physiological experience necessary to shake the world out of its slumber. It will do for freedom and prosperity what the sensation of envisioning a railroad did for Einstein.\n\nIn turn, it will allow us to dream of new possibilities to create wealth. It will be the regime change that Nipsey Hussle advocated for, and foreshadowed at the end of the song “[That’s How I Knew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk7k10--TuQ).”\n\nIn MLK Jr.’s final speech, *“I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,”* when he stated that “as a people, we will get to the Promised Land” he was speaking from the global perspective that Balaji advocates Elon to have. That perspective was dependent upon King’s willingness to avoid segregating his moral concerns. \\[1\\]\n\nThe promised land was, quite literally, freedom and prosperity.\n\nWeb3 is the promised land.\n\nIt should not be surprising that Elon is standing in front of the same watershed moment that MLK Jr. was when he decided to go global. [The ink was dry](https://www.nps.gov/articles/civil-rights-act.htm). \\[2\\]\n\nMLK Jr. knew the Civil Rights Act was not enough. He had to [speak out against the Vietnam war](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/vietnam-war).\n\nRacism was only ***one*** of [the three evils](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/martin-luther-king-hungry-club-forum/552533/) that contributed to the political, and moral isolation of the United States that King spoke about. \\[3\\]\n\nPoverty was another one of those evils.\n\nWe fail to realize not just the reason MLK Jr. did not cross the chasm to practical freedom and prosperity, but the conditions that made him a target. It was not just the openness of the balcony at his hotel in Memphis that put him in the scope of an assassin. The reason he flew to Memphis was ***the*** contributing factor.\n\nHe was in Memphis to march with sanitation workers. These sanitation workers earned wages so low that [many were on welfare and hundreds relied on food stamps to feed their families](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/memphis-sanitation-workers-strike).\n\nWhat MLK Jr. did in speaking about the war in Vietnam was not unlike what Balaji mentioned Benjamin Franklin did to garner support for the American Revolution. It is the same thing that Elon Musk must do.\n\nEstablish a worldwide constituency.\n\n## Martin Luther King Jr. Couldn’t Establish A Worldwide Constituency\n\nMost Americans - including Black Americans - disliked MLK Jr. in the last year of his life. They wanted him to focus on race. I believe I know why.\n\nThe reason he was disliked is that there was no mechanism to align the interests of the citizens of the United States he was attempting to bring to the promised land. MLK Jr. was ***forced to*** ***only*** ***speak*** about issues of freedom and prosperity because the technology that is available to Elon did not exist during the civil rights movement.\n\n[250,000 people](https://www.nps.gov/articles/march-on-washington.htm) attended the March on Washington. MLK Jr. may have spoken about his dream that white people and Black people would hold hands, but do not forget that the *“March on Washington”* is an abbreviation for *“[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/march-washington-jobs-and-freedom).”*\n\nIf Web3 technology existed, MLK Jr. could have announced the MLKdrop. The market cap of a CivilRightsCoin is almost impossible to fathom.\n\nThe significance of the need for digital property rights in the context of civil rights is highlighted when you consider the fact that [MLK Jr.’s family ](https://www.si.com/college/2015/01/09/george-raveling)*[doesn’t own](https://www.si.com/college/2015/01/09/george-raveling)*[ the physical copy of his “I Have A Dream” speech from that day](https://www.si.com/college/2015/01/09/george-raveling).\n\n## Deng’s Reforms\n\nI would like to underscore what Balaji calls the ethical imperative of internationalization - going global. In his essay he writes:\n\n> *“Granting individuals true digital property rights over their accounts turns them from serfs at the mercy of American corporate feudalists into self-sovereign actors in their own right. That's not only more just, but more profitable for both parties, because serfs can't invest in their land but free people can. Given just how much time and energy is spent by millions of people on these digital plots of land, this may be an unlock on par with [Deng's reforms](https://archive.ph/5GQkA#selection-611.0-611.245).”*\n\nWhen he said this I couldn’t help but think of [Nipsey Hussle](https://twitter.com/NipseyHussle) and [Iddris Sandu](https://twitter.com/iddris_sandu)’s comments about Hip Hop culture’s level on the [Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale). Iddris was interviewed on the radio by Big Boi and he spoke about Deng’s reforms, although he did not mention it specifically:\n\n> *“Let’s think of hip hop culture as a civilization. . . We not even a type 1 civilization yet. We haven’t even harnessed the power of culture, hip hop culture hasn’t fully reached its peak yet. How do i know this? We the gardeners that plant the seed, we grow the tree and cultivate it, but we don’t get the fruits.”*\n\nWhat Iddris and Nipsey were speaking about was the same transition that Balaji discussed. The graduation from serfs into self-sovereign actors, where we collectively unlock the value of the digital plots that we tend to. \\[4\\]\n\nI have more to say on this, but for now:\n\nWe should all be for the Elondrop. It’s what Nipsey wanted. It’s what MLK Jr. wanted.\n\nIt’s the path to the promised land.\n\n\\[1\\] “…there are people who are confused about the war and they say to me and anybody who speaks out against it, “You shouldn’t be speaking out. You’re a civil rights leader, and the two issues should not be joined together.” Well … the two issues are tied together. And I’m going to keep them together. Oh my friends, it’s good for us to fight for integrated lunch counters, and for integrated schools. And I’m going to continue to do that. But wouldn’t it be absurd to be talking about integrated schools without being concerned about the survival of a world in which to be integrated …” - [MLK Jr.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/martin-luther-king-hungry-club-forum/552533/)\n\n\\[2\\] [This link](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html) shows that Elon’s bid was signed. We must not forget that the Civil Rights bill was signed before MLK Jr. was assassinated. He was not killed for civil rights. MLK Jr. was killed for speaking up against the Vietnam war and economic inequality. He was advocating for the same political and economic empowerment that Elon could actually pull off.\n\n\\[3\\] “We have left ourselves as a nation morally and politically isolated in the world…” - [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/martin-luther-king-hungry-club-forum/552533/)\n\n\\[4\\]  [MLK Jr. spoke about Deng’s reforms too](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxIjuP8yT0bLfEWgrE8obG-MkJiKWEMgnI).", "timestamp": 1657242680, "digest": "z2wd0VfdJxNRhMHY_ww_ceOthedBB4KZkVJj7pZOqPw", "contributor": "0x39665aF6A74f1ca25955Ef1744fE994E598E51a9"}
{"id": "hCTBry1guJhtCSSWAK95HkUhCVhSnKmHVwXoMKF2g-g", "title": "Scarcity Networks: Social Networks on Web3", "body": "The power of web3 is what originally got me into crypto. I analyzed the web2 platforms as an equity research analyst at Barclays, and immediately recognized the potential of web3 to fix much of what I thought was broken in web2 social networks.\n\nEarly conversations about blockchain-based social networks were mostly focused on what could be accomplished by leveraging a different data structure, centering the conversation on “data ownership,” privacy, and digital identity. The switching argument was values-based and not compelling enough for most to deal with any degree of friction on decentralized networks.\n\nNow, as social networks begin to blend with DeFi, the switching argument is about economic incentives, rather than moral imperatives, and the novel functionality they offer: publicly trade and display cultural symbols; invest with and in your friends; earn your way into exclusive social circles; connect directly with your favorite creators; prove ownership of digital assets. Eventually, activity on these networks will create an open social graph that is used to offer better DeFi rates and/or lower collateralization ratios. These new social networks combine social and financial capital, making them approachable to the mainstream in a way that DeFi wasn’t. Everyone understands social capital.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1427681957291376643](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1427681957291376643)\n\nArguing about whether DeFi is more important than NFTs or whether NFTs, DAOs, or Social Tokens will reign as the dominant social networks of web3 misses the point. Their interconnectedness is what makes web3 so powerful. NFTs create an impetus for people to quickly spin up DAOs, which then serve as NFT market makers. NFTs will act as keys to DAOs, governed according to social token ownership. The metaverse is comprised of the combination of these things, which, in turn, only increase the importance of being able to prove digital ownership. DeFi makes these networks possible and all the activity on these networks will be used to amplify DeFi. Save the tribalism for Punks vs. Apes.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ianIDEO/status/1429156970645233670](https://twitter.com/ianIDEO/status/1429156970645233670)\n\n## Web3 is Not a Protest, it’s Closer to a Cultural Movement\n\nTo understand what’s happening with web3, we need to quickly revisit the shortcomings of web2 social networks. In short, web2 platforms own your online identity and social graph and hold all the power, the business model is extractive to the user and the incentives create a terrible user experience (low signal engagement, disinformation, high ad load, etc.) Web2 social networks suffered as they scaled, weakly connecting people within an increasingly less exclusive network. Web2 lost any sense of belonging.\n\nSocial networks combined with elements of DeFi flip many of the web2 incentives but they’ll still be subject to the worst of human nature (after all social networks are built on human interactions.) They’ll still revolve around status and image, but should be much higher signal as web3 is built around ownership rather than indication. Web3 still requires you to be part of a club/clique to participate, but it clearly specifies the process and cost of joining. Web3’s immutable ledger creates accountability where web2 has none, and on-chain interaction encourages less noise and higher quality engagement. It’s still signaling, but it’s more costly and, therefore, more credible.\n\nWe originally thought web3 would be built on trust, but turns out it’s actually built on scarcity. The downside is that scarcity networks create FOMO by design, are exclusive by definition, and encourage impulsive behavior as being late carries the risk of being shut out entirely. The benefit is that scarcity will also allow web3 social networks to more effectively scale. The ability to easily spin up DAOs in web3 means that the number of communities can scale rather than the size of the network. Since these communities reward early adopters, gradually converting social capital into financial capital, they offer compounding benefits as they grow.³ An open social graph describing all of this activity would be more powerful than anything that could be built on web2.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1429890905163517958](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1429890905163517958)\n\nWeb3 social networks should also be better at continuously reinventing themselves,² since they determine their own outcomes, in contrast to web2 platforms which lost relevance with many of their users years ago. Web3 participants are (literally) invested in the communities they join, which should help maintain quality over time. The best creators and contributors will migrate to web3, rather than stay on on rent-seeking web2 platforms. Web2 platforms and corporate brands will continue to try, but they cannot reverse engineer these dynamics. This revolution has to occur at the protocol layer.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ianIDEO/status/1403753637633875968](https://twitter.com/ianIDEO/status/1403753637633875968)\n\nWe originally thought web3 would be a protest against web2 monopolies but it looks more like a cultural movement. While culture may be the hook that draws new people into the ecosystem, most of the activity currently occurring on these networks is only partially about culture, at best.\n\n> ***If the mantra of web2 was “come for the tool, stay for the network”, the mantra of web3 is probably closer to “come for the culture, stay for the returns.” And the returns are why most people are involved right now.***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8dcef255-12b3-4a05-b0e3-345ddf4d2082.jpg?height=475&width=1165)\n\nEach social component of web3 represents a slightly different value system, but they’re all built on the same principle: scarcity.\n\n## NFTs: The Content Layer - Not Just a Status Symbol\n\n*Web2 analog: NFTs combine elements of Instagram (influence and image) and LinkedIn (status and prestige.) Depending who you ask, owning a Punk is either like owning a Ferrari or [having gone to Harvard](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1423657661162311686).*\n\n![https://twitter.com/HarryBTC/status/1416435920061018119](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dad8812a-f4b3-42b9-a757-718b56262ec8.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nMost people attribute the recent NFT mania to two things 1.) NFTs as a store of value 2.) NFTs as a status symbol. I think it’s true that the market is at least partially driven by people looking for non-$ denominated stores of value in an inflationary environment. Afterall, [Visa bought a cryptopunk before they bought bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/visa-buys-cryptopunk-nft-for-150000.html). But NFTs are also about status (sorry if you thought this was about art). Wealthy people have always used expensive items to signal status, whether it be fine art, yachts, private jets, or handbags.¹ NFTs just make ownership of those items verifiable and public.\n\n> ***It’s not really socially acceptable to have a profile picture (PFP) of your Lambo, but you’re encouraged to display your Punk. MTV Cribs existed to solve this exact problem— how do I flex my otherwise hidden wealth? NFTs.***\n\nPublic display of these status symbols actually drives more demand for them, playing to our natural [mimetic desires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory). A public ledger also creates bragging rights in that we now have proof that someone got in early, spotted that trend before everyone else, is a die hard fan. Immutable proof that you’re cool. How much would you pay for that?\n\nBut there is something more going on with NFTs. It’s not just about status anymore than they’re just a store of value. People held Punks long before they were a flex, and if you ask anyone trading NFTs, they’ll tell you that selling them is the worst part. Maybe that’s because when you sell your NFT, you also lose your tribe. An NFT bonds you with your fellow Apes and communicates to everyone that you belong to a certain group. The public ledger also ties you to a lineage of everyone who has ever owned that NFT. This not only adds [a whole new dimension of value to digital art](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1431731996607275010), it elevates you into a new social standing and even ensures your legacy in a way (you’re now an unforgettable part of history.)\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus/status/1429193578664837121](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus/status/1429193578664837121)\n\n### No Real-time Feedback Loop\n\nA huge tenet of web2 platforms is that they support real-time feedback loops (Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) NFTs do not right now. NFT markets are illiquid and price discovery is still inefficient. In other words, NFTs aren’t good at conveying real-time information yet, meaning status is mostly inferred. We know it’s worth something, but we don’t really know what.\n\nThis won’t last for long. Almost every CeFi exchange is building an NFT marketplace and there are many startups working on the “financialization of NFTs.” However, these inefficiencies are part of what enables outsized financial returns. While DeFi maximalists love to hate NFTs, the NFT market feels pretty degen.\n\n## Social Tokens: The Social Graph - Exclusivity\n\n*Web2 analog: Social Tokens are similar to TikTok, in that they allow anyone to go viral. They also represent the web2 shift away from crowded networks to private messaging groups, discord servers, etc.*\n\n*NFTs have utility beyond collection. One of the things they can be used for is as keys that unlock access to creators and communities.*\n\n![Ihttps://future.a16z.com/creator-before-community/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e8d95ead-e8cd-492c-a139-7e74762f7066.jpg?height=464&width=885)\n\nSocial tokens are digital assets backed by the reputation of a brand, individual or community.3 They can be fungible or non-fungible. Supply can be fixed or determined by a bonding curve (so that price increases along with distribution of the token.) They fall into two categories: personal tokens (fan clubs) and community tokens (social circles.) Both give holders exclusive access to a person or community. Personal tokens can be launched more quickly versus community tokens, which require coordinating a group towards a shared vision. However, community tokens may benefit from broader distribution, which has proven important in web2. As of Dec 2020, the total marketcap of all social tokens was $81M, now the marketcap of $FWB (one of the most prominent community tokens) alone is $180M.\n\nAll of these tokens rely on the belief that a creator or community will become more valuable tomorrow than it is today. Some represent Income Sharing Agreements (ISA), but others grant access to a newsletter, a private chat, or even a voting system that lets people[ dictate a creator’s daily habits](https://www.coindesk.com/man-who-sells-himself-now-wants-buyers-to-control-his-life) ($ALEX). The artist[ Connie Digital](https://twitter.com/conniedigital?lang=en) rewarded $HUE holders with a shout-out on a virtual billboard. The rapper Lil Yachty issued surprise boxes and virtual parties exclusively to $YACHTY holders. $WHALE issued a social token, backed by top NFTs, that holders can use as a payment method on OpenSea.7 Grammy-award winning musician RAC and NBA point guard Spencer Dinwiddie have also introduced tokens to give fans a stake in their success.⁶ Community tokens often grant access to an exclusive newsletter, discord server, and token-gated IRL events.\n\n### A Different Type of Walled Garden?\n\nScarcity is a double edged sword for social tokens as it means as membership grows, entry becomes inaccessible to most ($FWB membership is now priced at +$14,000). These communities will need to experiment with tiered models, in which entry level membership is lower cost and higher levels of membership can be earned through more active participation. Most token communities are introducing the concept of seasons and performance-based systems to avoid free-rider problems anyway.\n\n> ***While scarcity improves scalability, if it comes at the expense of accessibility, we’ll just end up with a different type of walled garden.***\n\nOne way to reduce this tendency could be to build these communities on a combination of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. An NFT could serve as the key to a community (and even different cohorts, tiers, or functions within that community) and then social tokens could be used to determine ownership and influence (via governance stake) within that community.\n\nSocial tokens have many potential benefits but they also run the greatest risk of amplifying the more toxic dynamics of web2. These risks will be magnified with social tokens that are purely speculative (don’t grant any access or non-financial rewards to holders.) Creators or influencers should have full autonomy over their tokens, or at least be required to opt-in. After all, social tokens invite the public to openly speculate on a person or group’s worth. I can’t think of a scenario in which being able to short a personal social token wouldn’t be problematic. Social tokens quantify popularity and create an in-group. Membership should probably be earned rather than bought.\n\n## Social DAOs: The Aggregation Layer - Social Circles\n\n*Web2 analog: DAOs, literally and figuratively, are a Discord. DAOs also enable Wall Street Bets (partybids) to actually win against Wall Street sharks (whales) and turn web3 into a MMORPG.*\n\n*Amidst this explosion of NFTs and social tokens, DAOs will play the role of aggregator. Aggregators accrued most of the value in web2 and, in web3, DAOs will aggregate by collecting, curating, and moderating.*\n\n![https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4e0459c1-39ab-432b-87ca-db12d1c9ed5f.jpg?height=596&width=1071)\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations are internet-native collectives that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals.5 DAOs aren’t new (remember The DAO circa 2016?) but they’ve seen a recent resurgence. In 2019, DeepDAO only recorded 10 DAOs. That number is now 133. This increase was driven by a variety of factors including the launch of DeFi protocol governance tokens, some legal frameworks out of Wyoming and Delaware (series LLCs), and the rise of the NFT market, which created an impetus for the quick formation of DAOs to pool capital together in pursuit of an otherwise unobtainable NFT. Who knows, maybe DAOs become the social clubs of the metaverse.\n\nSocial DAOs are the most explicit mechanism by which to combine both social and financial capital. They create digital social circles and can also empower a collective of individuals to flip power dynamics against wealthy individuals. In NFT bidding wars, they can empower a group of individuals to overtake an individual whale (sometimes causing them to switch sides and join the DAO). They also enable co-creation and collective participation in a way that isn’t really possible on web2.\n\n> ***Yes, DAOs are more about community than scarcity. However, they are still scarcity networks as you either have to be asked to join or buy your way in (usually at an increasingly expensive price).***\n\n### We Have the Network, but Not the Tools\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5627c193-3d71-44a8-bcd0-4ad52d494af2.jpg?height=665&width=1151)\n\nDAOs are not really DAOs yet, meaning most are not actually decentralized, autonomous, or organized. In theory, DAOs reduce coordination costs. In practice, they might even increase them. Common pain points include: lack of regulatory clarity, keeping up with communications and proposals, treasury management, division of labor, allocating payments to members, (semi)-centralized operations, and community selection and engagement. This last point is becoming more important as DAOs mature and people realize the importance of carefully curating a committed community.\n\n## A Social Protocol: The Reputation Layer - Credibility\n\n*Web2 analog: Twitter + Facebook, but built on Ethereum. On-chain interactions (NFTs, social tokens, and DAOs) create an open social graph that can be leveraged by social protocols.*\n\nAll social networks start with identity, create a graph between identities, and then attempt to infer things from that graph (reputation, for example.) In web3, ENS + MetaMask replaces SSO as the de facto log-in, allowing web3 identity to integrate with applications beyond a given identity provider’s ecosystem. Eventually wallets will become more like profiles, with native NFT integration for profile pictures, Rabbithole integration for on-chain resumes, and mirror + NFT marketplaces for on-chain portfolios. Interactions between identities will be combined to create an open social graph. Of course, not all interactions will be on chain, but what settles on-chain will allow developers to:\n\n* Create friend-matching mechanisms based on NFT ownership, DAO membership, social token ownership, and protocol usage\n* Better curate communities\n* Establish community-based delegated credit based on proven membership in particular DAOs\n* Develop a[ web of trust](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3375436), the ultimate path towards decentralized reputation and un/undercollateralized lending which ties all of the activity on web3 social networks right back to DeFi again. Social tokens could be used as collateral to bootstrap reputation until we have a full web of trust\n\n  <https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1419773010425401353>\n\n### It’s Always about Identity\n\nThe non-persistence of online identity is probably the biggest obstacle to effectively utilizing this open social graph. As web2 evolved, users moved away from using their real identities. Finsta, anon, and alt accounts became the norm. On web3 people have public .eth addresses complemented by many other private addresses. Identity is important to social protocols, though, because it creates social accountability, which is totally missing in web2 and DeFi. Incentives (different levels of access or better DeFi rates) could be offered for higher levels of attestation, which could include Proof of Humanity, POAP, and Proof of Participation. Incorporating zero-knowledge proofs into these solutions could help balance verification and privacy. Personal social tokens could also be used as a sort of identity proxy, providing an alternative to hardcoding identity on-chain for those that value privacy more highly.\n\n![Based on https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1413631784135192576](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7da1ebba-59e7-4624-80c3-983a21f785d0.jpg?height=356&width=1026)\n\n## Web3 Will Not Fix Everything\n\nSocial exchange theory totally broke down on web2.[ Key concepts of social exchange theory](https://start-thinking.com/sm-and-comm-theories) include reciprocity, fairness and negotiated rules, with information, approval, respect, power, group gain and personal satisfaction among the rewards in successful transactions. Web3 restores critical elements of social exchange.\n\n> ***That said, technology doesn’t eliminate natural human instincts and, therefore, technology alone won’t prevent some of the toxic elements of web2 from creeping into web3.***\n\nWeb3 will still be about brand and status, cliques and clubs, and one-upping everyone else. Web3 is still addicting — just ask anyone on OpenSea at 4am. Nobody really knows the consequences of day-trading culture and scarcity networks that reward status and profit above all else. People who can’t afford to will lose millions trying to fit in.⁴ This system of in-groups will exacerbate the industry’s lack of diversity.\n\n> If web3 really is about culture, then we should ask ourselves how representative the culture we’re talking about is and if these networks are actually open or designed to reinforce [preferential attachment models](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment).\n\n[https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1430997412756262914](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1430997412756262914)\n\nThe biggest opportunity web3 has relative to web2, is that web3 doesn’t have to be zero-sum. It’s multi-player and participants literally have a vested interest in each other and the quality of the communities they build. The value generated by web3 should at least accrue to those creating art, contributing content, and building lasting communities rather than siloed monopolies. Participants will finally have a voice and a vote.\n\nIt feels like we are at a web3 inflection point, but we are nowhere near mainstream yet. NFT users are in the lower double digit millions relative to the roughly 4 billion users of web2 social networks. Web2 social networks have generated trillions in marketcap…. imagine what web3 can generate and then consider that it more effectively scales.\n\nPeter Thiel has[ a theory](https://sacks.substack.com/p/your-startup-is-a-movement?r=5eprj&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=twitter%20Looks%20rare.) that the best startups are like cults that believe something true. Web3 certainly feels like a cult and whether we believe it’s about culture, status, or scarcity, the value it’s creating is undeniably true.\n\nWeb3. Looks rare 👀\n\n\n---\n\n[Get in touch!](https://twitter.com/j_humenansky)\n\nThank you to the following for generous feedback: Dylan Hunzeker, [Chris Kurdziel](https://twitter.com/ckurdziel), [Medha Kothari](https://twitter.com/medhakothari), and [Matt Stephenson](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt)\n\n### References \n\n1.

Subsequent articles will analyze the decentralized exchange of assets and decentralized lending and derivatives. These articles assume a foundational knowledge of both financial markets and [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) technology.\n\nThe most widely used application of blockchain technology is in the creation of digital currencies, which has required the development of financial markets to support their exchange. However, these financial markets, in their current state, prevent fair and open access. Furthermore, the infrastructure that supports blockchain-based markets is vulnerable to counterparty risk, censorship, a lack of transparency, and manipulation as it remains largely centralized. Current infrastructure flaws erode trust and inhibit adoption.\n\nJust as the internet allowed for the creation of a new information infrastructure, [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) technology allows for the creation of a new financial infrastructure and the development of entirely new markets. The [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) movement has emerged in an attempt to make the infrastructure that supports new and existing blockchain-based markets just as decentralized as the underlying technology.\n\n\n---\n\n## The DeFi Dream\n\nIn a functioning decentralized financial system, internet connection would be the only prerequisite to accessing financial services, rather than geography or circumstance. A reduction in the centralization of those that control and own the infrastructure underpinning financial markets would increase transparency, decrease costs, and reduce the opportunity for censorship and / or manipulation. The global “unbanked” (both individuals and enterprises) would gain access to financial services. [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) would not only facilitate markets for illiquid financial products that already exist but would also allow for the creation of new financial products and markets that don’t yet exist. The ability to more effectively arbitrage, borrow, hedge, and access liquidity would spur more institutions to join the movement without restricting the usage of these products and markets exclusively to them.\n\n## The DeFi Reality\n\nWhile [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/dapps) is referred to as “open finance” and is sometimes touted as a way to “bank the unbanked,” the truth of the matter is these products aren’t aimed at the mass retail investor, let alone the global “unbanked.” Technology is not usually the primary factor restricting access to financial services. More often than not, [identity ](https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/the-impact-of-digital-identity-9eed5b0c3016)and/or oppressive regimes are. On the retail side, it is unreasonable to believe that the average retail investor would understand the risk profile of even the simplest DeFi products and I’ve yet to hear a compelling argument for why the average retail investor would need access to exotic financial derivatives. UX/UI challenges present further obstacles to retail adoption.\n\nProduct-market fit for most institutional investors is not any clearer. Most DeFi projects aren’t well suited for HFT (high-frequency trading) since they’re limited in terms of speed. They are not well suited to trading large positions either and traditional finance institutions won’t even consider entering into transactions in which their counterparty is unknown. At this point, institutional traders aren’t willing to make these trade-offs so long as they can trust at least one other person in the markets in which they operate.\n\nAs a result, product-market fit is currently constrained to crypto-native power users that are comfortable with the existing UX/UI challenges of crypto networks and blockchain-based assets. For user adoption to accelerate, the trade-offs required by [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) interfaces must not outweigh the perceived benefit of ownership, access, and transparency when compared with centralized alternatives. A lack of developer education and tools is also restraining the industry. Tooling and services need to be further developed and a best-in-class stack needs to be established so that users don’t have to interact with a fragmented ecosystem marching in fragmented directions. Developers, regulators, lawyers, investors, professional traders, and retail users will have to work together to overcome existing challenges.\n\n> As a result, the transition towards a decentralized financial system is more likely to be evolutionary than revolutionary. That doesn’t diminish the potential of DeFi to reshape the way in which markets function and the way that the entire world interacts and transacts.\n\nWhile the DeFi movement has the potential to provide meaningful benefits over centralized alternatives, there are many practical challenges the DeFi industry needs to overcome first. **User adoption may be the biggest impediment to the development of the industry at present, new risks compounded across protocols may be the biggest threat to its sustainability.** An in-depth look at the 7 most pertinent challenges follows.\n\n### 1.) Identity and Reputation\n\nThe first step in entering into a financial transaction often requires the identification of transacting parties. However, a core tenant of [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) is that one’s ability to access financial services should not be dependent on most aspects of identity. This is problematic as violations of [KYC ](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2016/02/07/fincen-know-your-customer-requirements/)/ [AML ](https://www.finra.org/industry/anti-money-laundering)/ [OFAC ](https://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/olm_037.htm)regulations can not only result in large fines but could result in criminal charges. If a [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) Relayer (an entity that hosts on order book on a DeFi protocol) facilitates an exchange between unknown parties and those parties turn out to violate any of these regulations, the consequences may be serious. Furthermore, without a way to enforce identity, most proposals for decentralized governance of these projects are quickly reduced to plutocracy.\n\nWhile still far from complete solutions, projects are researching ways to allow for KYC (know your customer procedures) without introducing centralization. For example, Relayers on [0x](https://0x.org/why) can opt-in to implement a [permissioned liquidity pool ](https://blog.0xproject.com/compliant-peer-to-peer-trading-4dab8e5c3162)that ensures that pool is only accessible to whitelisted [Ethereum](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/ethereum/) addresses that meet certain requirements, such as those required by AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC policies. However, this method still doesn’t ensure identity in a way that allows one to know that a counterparty is trustworthy without excluding those outside of the traditional financial system and introducing centralization. Several parties have issued EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) to incorporate KYC/AML compliance into ERC-20 tokens. However, in many cases, these proposals would still require service providers to work together off-chain via a consortium to review each others’ KYC policies and it is still unclear whether these proposals would fully satisfy regulatory requirements.\n\nEstablishing reputation in [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) networks is a distinct challenge. This is a strong industry focus as the range of possible products expands when there is a sense of on-chain reputation. There are currently two main ways to attempt to establish reputation in these networks:\n\n* Allowing everyone to start on an equal playing field under the assumption that network participants are good actors. Participants that prove to be untrustworthy / uncreditworthy would subsequently be slashed (punished.) Underwriters on the Dharma network fall into this category, wherein they gradually build reputation over time via an on-chain record of their accuracy and behavior.\n* Porting existing credit data to a [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) network via an oracle. This is hardly an improvement over the traditional finance system in terms of allowing for fair access.\n\nThe lack of an on-chain reputation method that doesn’t require users to reveal too much about their personal identity means most DeFi projects require (over)collateralization in lieu of being able to establish trustworthiness.\n\n### 2.) Capital Inefficiency\n\nThe overcollateralization required by DeFi projects is capital inefficient. [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/da/) requires users to deposit 1.5x the value of ETH to establish the collateralized debt position underpinning Dai (CDPs will be covered in more depth in *Risk Off or On?: Decentralized Lending and Derivatives*.) Even still, most people choose to keep their “loan-to-value” ratio at 300 percent in order to avoid double digit liquidation penalties.¹ Similarly, Compound requires a 2x collateralization ratio, which the company says will decrease over time.² However, some users indicated a willingness to post 4x–5x the required collateral.²\n\n> ***Until a decentralized reputation system is developed, there is little choice but to require users to lock up excess capital, dulling the benefit of taking out these positions to begin with. Even when/if reputation is solved, the volatility of the underlying positions could result in a persistent preference to overcollateralize.***\n\n### 3.) Oracles\n\nCorruption of on-chain oracles (the mechanism that finds and submits real-world data to a smart contract) is a huge concern for these systems since liquidation occurs automatically in the event that collateral levels drop below their specified “loan-to-value” ratios. Different DeFi projects approach oracles in different ways, but many projects in the space are using MakerDAO’s oracle. MakerDAO’s oracle is currently designed to support single collateral Dai (backed entirely by ETH) but will be re-designed to support multi-collateral Dai (backed by a pool of different cryptocurrencies) in the near future. MakerDAO’s oracle pulls data from sixteen different sources for its oracle feed. These sources are comprised of [Ethereum](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/ethereum/) addresses voted on by MKR token holders, which are then submitted to an autonomous smart contract. The oracle chooses the median of all sixteen submitted data points. This system allows for 51% tolerance as it excludes the outliers which are more likely to be submitted by malicious actors.¹ Importantly\\*\\*,\\*\\* MakerDAO also utilizes an oracle security module in which the second layer of the protocol can activate an emergency shut down. This shut down freezes the system at its last known “safe state” if it has reason to believe the oracle may have been compromised. If an emergency shutdown occurs, users can convert their Dai to ETH at the equivalent of 1$/1 Dai, according to the state of the ledger at its last determined “safe state.¹”\n\nSingle collateral Dai oracles update every time the price of ETH fluctuates by +/-1.0% but multi-collateral Dai (MCD) oracles will update once an hour.¹ This allows the sixteen oracle inputs to be viewable for an hour before they are acted upon, increasing transparency. However, such a long lag time may not be appropriate considering the volatility of cryptoassets. The company’s argument that this delay can be compensated for by the risk model is questionable. Furthermore, liquidation of collateralized positions (essentially defaults) will be executed via auction with MCD, which means it will “six hours or more” to liquidate positions as the protocol accesses “all the arbitrageurs and liquidity across the whole marketplace and ecosystem.¹” The impact of having to wait 6 hours to unwind a single position during times of market distress, or failure, would be significant.\n\n[Compound ](https://compound.finance/)takes a different approach with its oracle, aggregating and averaging price feeds from a series of exchanges and posting them on-chain consistently. The data updates every time the underlying value fluctuates by +/- 0.1%, but data is updated on-chain every 15–30 seconds, confined by the processing speed of Ethereum.² Given the importance of oracles in these systems, DeFi projects may want to more closely consider which method they use or choose to implement their own methods.\n\n### 4.) Network: Platform, Liquidity, Scale\n\nMost current DeFi solutions are built on top of Ethereum and therefore DeFi’s adoption is tied to the scalability and usability of the Ethereum network. The scalability debate is well known (and addressed below) while usability remains a challenge as mainstream users still struggle to easily interact with [Web 3.0](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/web-3-0/).\n\n> ***While the composability of protocols built on Ethereum creates even larger switching costs, it also introduces network risk. As more projects build on Ethereum, it may become harder to upgrade the base layer protocol in a way that allows for backwards compatibility.***\n\nPart of the power of DeFi is that it allows for the creation of new markets. However, decentralized markets suffer the same circular problem that all new markets do: adoption is required to generate liquidity, but liquidity is a driver of adoption. While DeFi can enable new markets and allow new participants to access them, it does not automatically create liquid markets for these products. This is a problem because assets that are illiquid tend to trade at a discount to their liquid counterparts.³ It also creates inefficient pricing as opportunities for arbitrage go uncaptured since it remains difficult to move quickly and seamlessly between crypto markets.\n\nAlex Evans of Placeholder VC [breaks down ](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/4/9/defi-liquidity-models)the models of current DeFi networks into three broad categories:\n\n* Those that require users to find peers to trade with. *[Augur](https://www.augur.net/), [0x](https://0x.org/why), [Dharm](https://www.dharma.io/)a*\n* Those that pool “maker” assets and offer them to “takers” for a fee. *[Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/)*\n* Those that set parameters through governance, allowing users to trade directly with a smart contract. Ex: *[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/da/)*\n\nEach model has implications for liquidity. The lack of requirement to find a specific peer with which to trade seems to be the design advantage of the top protocols. These protocols also tend to offer fewer options in terms of products / use cases, which pools demand, facilitating better liquidity. Alex Evans also believes automatic and consistent processes (MakerDAO) better facilitate liquidity than bespoke and varied ones (Augur.) This seems to have been one of the drivers behind [UMA ](https://umaproject.org/)and Dharma deciding to set tighter parameters on their products (relative to a completely open system in which individual users set all parameters.)\n\n> ***“At least initially, the markets that have built deep pooled liquidity in a handful of important markets appear to have the adoption lead versus those that have tried to create a multi-asset infrastructure.” — Alex Evans***\n\nAssuming these markets find a way to bootstrap the necessary liquidity, [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/blockchain/) infrastructure is not yet scalable enough to process volumes similar to those processed by centralized exchanges. For a sense of the limited scale of current DeFi networks, investor at [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/), Arjun Balaji, [predicts ](https://medium.com/@arjunblj/crypto-theses-for-2019-dd20cb7f9895)that December 2019’s aggregate volume on 0x will lag a single day’s volume on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). While advances are being made in Layer 2 scalability and innovative solutions such as [StarkDEX ](https://blog.0xproject.com/starkdex-bringing-starks-to-ethereum-6a03fffc0eb7)(currently partnering with 0x) show promise, current [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/blockchain/) infrastructure has a long way to go before it can support volumes similar to those supported in traditional markets.\n\n*\\*\\*Front-running, and other opportunities for manipulation, on DeFi networks will be addressed in Trade-Offs: Decentralized Exchange.\\*\\**\n\n### 5.) Business Models Still Undefined\n\nWhile there are many options, most DeFi projects have left their monetization method “undefined” and are focused on “defining the incentives of the protocol at large.⁴” However, at some point these projects will need to generate revenue if they are to persist.\n\n[dYdX ](https://dydx.exchange/')[highlights](http://unchained.forbes.libsynpro.com/how-dydx-allows-you-to-take-a-short-position-in-one-token-ep86) three main monetization models for DeFi projects:\n\n* Value accrual via a native token. *MakerDAO (MKR)*\n* Monetization via fees. P*otentially Compound*\n* Monetization via a user facing application. *dYdX, Dharma, etc.*\n\nIn most cases, a native token monetization model introduces another layer of friction to user adoption. For other projects it might not make sense. For example, a token monetization model doesn’t make much sense in networks where ownership / voting percentage can be determined by participation, which is recorded on-chain.² Nadav Hollander of Dharma points out that a fee model implemented at the protocol level, in addition to being somewhat anathema to blockchain ideology, could easily be forked away.⁴ However, Compound is not against keeping a small amount of the interest flowing through the system in a model akin to the AUM model in traditional finance.²\n\nThe latter appears to be the prevailing model. Dharma, dYdX, and others found that they needed to build out full stack products ([Expo ](https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/introducing-expo-ffe74a328f85)on dYdX, for example) because they found that developers weren’t willing to invest the time necessary to build on these new protocols. While the 0x model is often touted as the exemplary model, 0x’s success was enabled, in part, because there was already an existing market for DEXs (decentralized exchanges.) 0x’s protocol opened into an existing market, whereas these new DeFi protocols have to create new markets from scratch.\n\n> ***In an effort to bypass many of the challenges of creating a two-sided marketplace from scratch, it’s likely that new DeFi protocols will continue to build out full stack services and monetize those, at least over the near term.***\n\nIt is important to remember that creating a marketplace is a service business and that is unlikely to change. Whatever entity enables a marketplace also has to offer services to both the demand and supply sides. Marketplaces can’t be created out of thin air, even by the smartest protocols. They will always require a team / company to support the ecosystem with the services that allow marketplaces to live and grow.\n\n> ***As a result, designing businesses with “minimal viable decentralization” may be a more efficient way of launching of products and approaching early governance⁶ although its likely to be viewed less favorably by those that prioritize decentralization above all else.***\n\nDeFi business models are not constrained to the above mentioned models. For example, [Arwen ](https://www.arwen.io/)is planning to monetize via a revenue sharing agreement with centralized exchanges for the trades referred by Arwen⁵ (further details will be provided in *Trade-Offs: Decentralized Exchange*\\*\\*.\\*\\*)\n\n### 6.) New Risks Compounding Across Protocols\n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain-based markets have fundamentally different characteristics than their traditional counterparts. DeFi protocols benefit from composibility which leads to faster innovation, but also results in higher levels of interdependancy. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that the risk profile of these products, especially in combination, is not yet fully understood. While each project claims to have developed its own robust risk models, the complexity of analyzing these new risks across interdependent protocols is non-trivial\\*\\*.\\*\\* It’s also worth noting that most risk models weren’t very useful in 2008. In some cases, these models failed because just one assumption was flawed.\n\nMany of these projects utilize concepts that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, but more importantly, they utilize them in new and untested ways. For example, the rehypothecation of collateral\\*\\*,\\*\\* fractional ownership of structured products, and pooling of risk were all elements of the 2008 financial crisis. DeFi takes these concepts and applies them to highly volatile and hard to value assets in relatively illiquid markets with insufficient safeguards. The combination of all of these factors, combined with the complexity of creating a cohesive view of collateral rehypothecated across protocols, creates an entirely new risk profile for which there is little precedent. [Superfluid collateral](https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-to-earn-money-on-collateral-in-defi-and-why-thats-risky/)? Let’s not do this.\n\nIn this context, it’s worth considering what a market failure would look like. MakerDAO is an experimental network upon which the success of many other projects depends. It is important to remember that in the case of market failure, CDPs and other DeFi products are not insured and a third-party is not likely to step in to recapitalize small cap crypto start-ups (moral hazard debate aside.) Investors, users, and token holders will be responsible for recapitalizing this highly interdependent DeFi system.\n\nThe systemic impact would likely be jarring. Dai is commonly traded on 0x Relayers as a pair with ETH. It is often deposited on Compound and then lent out again to hedge funds to be used for risk-on trades. dYdX is also dependent upon MakerDAO since its short ETH token is long Dai. dYdX further depends on Dharma (which lends in Dai) and the 0x protocol (which facilitates the trading of Dai) to access liquidity. The cascading effect of a failure of any one of these protocols would likely cause a systemic unwind that is rapid (due to volatility of underlying, rehypothecation, and automated execution of smart contracts), jarring (these markets are not as liquid as traditional markets), and significant. The rewards may be high, but the risk is at least commensurate.\n\n> Cryptoeconomics don’t defy the principals of regular economics and cryptofinance (DeFi) can’t escape the classic risk/reward constraint of regular finance.\n\n### 7.) Regulation\n\nThe primary concern regarding regulation of the industry doesn’t seem to be that current regulations are too restrictive, but rather the concern is related to the ambiguity as to how existing regulations will be applied in regards to blockchain-based networks and cryptocurrencies. Many of the startups in the space don’t know how to determine whether they should launch or not because the regulatory environment they are operating in is so unclear. The cost of all this uncertainty is high.\n\n> ***In fact, the regulatory burden is so high that some start- ups have determined that they don’t have enough capital to launch in a fully compliant manner, made all the more difficult by the recent crypto winter fundraising environment.***\n\n\n---\n\n## From Dream to Reality\n\nProjects in the space are acutely aware of the above cited problems and are actively working to overcome them. For example, Dharma now pays gas fees for users to make the user experience easier while MakerDAO is planning to abstract the process of converting Dai to MKR upon redemption for MCD. Networks across the board are increasingly removing the requirement to hold native tokens, choosing to replace them with more widely used cryptocurrencies such as Dai or ETH. This is an important step since it removes what has historically been a hurdle to DeFi adoption.\n\nNew innovations and projects also enter the space frequently and could provide solutions to many of the weaknesses of current projects. For example, the Arwen protocol is ideally suited to HFT since only the opening and closing of escrow gets posted on-chain, while the rest of the protocol operates like a Layer 2 channel, allowing trading to happen much more quickly.⁵ The trade is also only visible to the trading party and the exchange. Since there is no on-chain execution of individual trades, miners do not see the transactions ahead of time, eliminating most of the front running issues that DEXs face.⁵ The protocol could also solve other critical painpoints, such as allowing for fractionally collateralized options (which dYdX is actively working towards), trustless fiat conversion (via integration with banks) and quicker movement of tokens across exchanges, allowing for effective arbitrage.⁵\n\nIn 2017–2018, the main focus in the DeFi industry was on building DEX scalability and liquidity. Solutions for each are quickly evolving. The focus in 2018–2019 has shifted to lending. The composability of DeFi products should allow the whole ecosystem to move forward at a faster pace and may allow for more mainstream adoption throughout 2019, as users are lured into the ecosystem via multiple protocols (trading, lending, derivatives) that all require users to transact with cryptocurrency.\n\nMany of these dynamics could spur more usage and adoption in the next eighteen months, creating the flywheel effect common in two-sided markets. The key point is to acknowledge that while the challenges are persistent and numerous, the industry is far from stagnant, and real and rapid progress is being made. However, risks need to be seriously assessed and considered so that this progress can be sustained.\n\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n*All interviews personally conducted are unattributed*\n\n1. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/rune-christensen-of-makerdao-part-1-how-to-keep-a-crypto-collateralized-stablecoin-afloat/>\n2. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-youll-earn-interest-on-your-crypto-with-compound-ep-82/>\n3. <http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/country/illiquidity.pdf>).\n4. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/nadav-hollander-on-how-dharma-could-create-new-forms-of-debt-ep-80/>\n5. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-to-trade-on-crypto-exchanges-without-fear-of-hacks/>\n6.

the right of an organization, country, or region to be independent and govern itself ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/autonomy)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** in contrast to traditional corporations, daos cannot be controlled or *[captured](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)*\n* **design principle:** *design for the highest degree of autonomy (weakly linked, autonomous sub-daos) while providing checks and balances on distributed power*\n\nthe biggest difference between corporations and daos is that daos can be capture-resistant, meaning they incorporate mechanisms to prevent the capture of shared resources by bad actors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). in traditional corporate structures, capture resistance is weakly ensured via trust and reputation, since both matter in the repeated game of public business. internal capture is prevented via regulations enforced by higher-level, external agencies. daos require different assurances against capture since trust, reputation, and regulation are mostly absent in large, somewhat anonymous, digitally native networks. daos can be designed to be capture-resistant, but most aren’t. there are three main ways a dao can be captured:\n\n### 1.) control over decision making\n\nthe 2020 wave of daos pioneered “[progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/),” or turning control over to a community once a protocol built by a centralized core team achieved product-market-fit. this approach prevents the core team from being distracted by building a community and a product at the same time, and avoids design by committee, which isn’t usually conducive to shipping products. this method **builds community around collective ownership**, launching a token once operations are “sufficiently decentralized” and suddenly turning decision making over to a group of new token holders, usually via token-weighted governance. all decision making has been centralized up to this point and a large portion of product-related decisions often remain centralized. since decision making has been centralized from the start, decentralizing it can feel like giving up control, which core teams are often reluctant to do.\n\ncommunity members are drawn in by a token launch, not by co-building or participating in the network over time, which can create communities that are more speculative in nature. given a lack of other criteria, like previous contributions to the dao, tokens are generally distributed based on retroactive usage, which has proven to be a weak contributor acquisition method. contributors quickly become frustrated by a low degree of involvement in decision making. these dynamics can result in lower voter participation, making any decentralized decision making less capture-resistant as less voices are represented.\n\nregardless of the path towards decentralization, token-weighted governance increases the possibility of capture in the decision making process, the risks of which are well outlined [here](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html). Optimism’s two house governance system is a positive first step towards more capture-resistant governance (more [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/).)\n\n> **for daos to be capture-resistant, we must decouple power (decision making rights) from wealth (token holdings)**\n\n### 2.) control over resources\n\nto avoid some of these challenges, we experimented with a different decentralization method at [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/). our hope was to **build a community around collective decision making**, by inviting contributors to co-create with us much earlier in the decentralization process (pre-token) rather than building a community around collective ownership of an already finished product and token. We involved our community gradually in non-core business operations, spinning up a series of community-led working groups. however, since there was no mechanism for *decentralized* decision making, working groups were still reliant on external stakeholders for access to critical resources (in this case a centralized company, without a governance mechanism). as a result, our working groups were vulnerable to capture and we made the decision to pause this experiment until we could empower working groups with more autonomy.\n\neven when decentralized decision making does exist, the party controlling the resources (ie. parent dao) still has lower context as to the value a working group provides. while working groups may be equipped with their own budgets, they are still subject to a budget allocation process that is outside their control. even with a token to align incentives between a parent dao and a working group, the value a working group adds may not be reflected in the token value of the parent (ie. metagovernance, the value of which is hard to tie back to a core business value.)\n\n> **when one group controls access to resources for another, the relationship becomes adversarial**\n\nwhile working groups help to control and separate scope within a monolithic organization, the higher autonomy design choice is to replace them with multiple sub-daos. autonomous sub-daos allow communities to organize around specific goals with complete autonomy over how to achieve them, to maintain direct ownership over their own resources, and to share directly in any upside generated from their efforts.\n\nthese sub-daos can focus on building either the supply side (to increase the scale/scope of product offerings) or the demand side (to explore new use cases or aggregate users). they may also take the form of a subsidiary, providing services across the ecosystem (ie. metagovernance.) all sub-daos should have economically sustainable business models, so they are not dependent on external parties for resources, but a native token quickly becomes an important means of creating “[weak strategic alignment](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)” between daos via token swaps (more on this method [here](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1505977366991974402); see [MetricsDAO](https://twitter.com/MetricsDAO) and [Goblin Sax](https://twitter.com/goblinsax)).\n\n### 3.) control over execution\n\nthe greatest opportunity for capture occurs at the execution phase. governance generally works as follows (see more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)):\n\n* a proposal is put forward\n* the community votes on a proposal\n* the outcome of the proposal is either autonomously executed on-chain or an off-chain action is executed by a select party\n* execution is verified and / or analyzed by the community\n\nexecution is the phase most vulnerable to capture since nothing prevents those with execution power (ie. multi-sig signers) from ignoring the will of voters and executing whatever actions they choose. this doesn’t mean we should eliminate all positions of trust within daos. there is a common misconception that in order to avoid capture, decentralized organizations must be flat. but daos are leaderful, not leaderless. daos can still have hierarchy, it’s just that it’s fluid.\n\npositions of trust (like those with execution power) should be elected or legitimized by the broader community with clear mechanisms for removal if/when the responsibilities of those positions are abused or neglected. [Yearn’s gov 2.0](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460) proposes such a model, wherein highly autonomous yTeams are empowered by YFI holders to act independently in the best interest of yearn, within a constrained domain of action and discrete decision-making powers, subject to monitoring by YFI holders which have the power to remove contributors if roles are abused (more [here](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460)).\n\n> **being a leader in a dao is the most humbling thing I’ve ever done because you cannot rely on static positional authority. you must constantly earn respect with the community. on the good days, it’s meritocracy; on the bad days, trial by jury.**\n\npositions of trust don’t need to be open to the entire dao. while power should be distributed, it shouldn’t be permissionless. unauthorized participation can actually threaten a DAO’s resistance to capture as it creates more attack vectors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). while participation by as many community members as possible should be encouraged as an *input* into decision making, the ability to put forward certain proposals, make decisions, and hold positions of trust should be subject to qualifying criteria.\n\n> **daos (the human layer) do not need to be as decentralized as the protocols they are built around (the tech layer)**\n\n## **Emergence**\n\n* **what it means:** *the fact of something becoming known or starting to exist ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/emergence)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in corporations, ideas are dictated from the top down. in daos, initiatives surface organically from the community*\n* **design principle:** *emergent daos don’t have to be amorphous. a strong mission and culture can guide collective decision making without being overly prescriptive*\n\nemergence is vital to maintaining an active community. daos that don’t support emergence become little more than shell communities over time as contributors get frustrated having little ability to influence the dao. the most emergent daos are “day-one daos,” which form organically when groups of people rally around a mission, idea, belief, or event. they’re decentralized from the beginning and decide what to do or build collectively. these daos usually launch tokens immediately as a way to raise funding, which also immediately decentralizes decision making. this provides contributors with full autonomy to shape the dao emergently but day-one daos can struggle to guide decision making given the lack of structure.\n\nlet’s define culture as a set of shared beliefs about how decisions should be made (mission) and which behaviors will be rewarded (values). culture is mostly an afterthought in traditional corporations. decision makers are determined via hierarchy and decisions are implemented by force, so there is little need to define a framework around how decisions get made. In contrast, culture is a critical tool for guiding decisions made by a collective.\n\nwhy are mission statements so important for daos? because they provide a north star for decision making and set a general direction for the dao. directionless daos tend to lose momentum, and i’ve never seen a dao that lost momentum get it back. a strong mission can also create a moat. people think community is a moat but it can’t be since community members are constantly changing. your mission, however, can consistently draw in value-aligned contributors and keep them there when the dream of the dao inevitably fades into the reality of the dao ([twoirtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896203439091729)).\n\ncontributors can only meaningfully contribute to 3–4 daos, so they need a compelling reason to contribute to one over another. RabbitHole contributors have said they work with us specifically because they understand our mission and share our beliefs. this is important because it creates a sense of belonging, which is among the top things contributors crave.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\n![](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\nclear values are the second component of building a strong dao culture. more emergent daos tend to develop around icons, “mimetic filters,” lore, or specific events, which serve as a natural filter to draw in value-aligned contributors. they must then work together to collectively define their mission and values (see [Yearn Blue Pill](https://medium.com/iearn/the-blue-pill-ca44ed01f16f)). the best values make clear which behaviors will be rewarded and which actions should be prioritized over others within the dao (see [example](https://twitter.com/flynnjamm/status/1479485964225503233?s=21)).\n\nmission statements and values can be suggested by a core team (see [CCS](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/16G0rsr1ZzpbnHWNcNSNkY8YEz03jq6nn_5TA1hCmDqQ/mobilebasic), Mirror [1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Um_0l4WkIwEoBMxSCjIxv8xfPe_tJCn6I8eDFHNNIg/edit#slide=id.g102289b1e02_1_403),

[ENS)](https://twitter.com/AlexSlobodnik/status/1470545402554458112) or collectively created by contributors (see [OADAO](https://otherinter.net/research/pooltogether-offchain-report/)). regardless of the process for defining them, establishing a clear mission and values provides emergent daos with just enough guidance about how to make decisions without being overly prescriptive.\n\n## **Complexity**\n\n* **what it means:** *a complex system emerges organically as a result of the behaviors of the components within it, rather than according to a predetermined plan ([Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/impact/defining-complex-system/)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *most corporations are complicated systems, with any complexity tightly controlled by bureaucracy. daos are complex systems, meaning it’s hard to determine the impact actions in advance (more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3555&v=6mwVOp_7TFQ&feature=emb_logo)*)\n* **design principle:** *communities should co-create seasonal charters to guide efforts in a way that accounts for uncertainty while preventing chaos*\n\nsince well designed daos empower contributors to make decisions that can meaningfully change the trajectory of the organization, outcomes are hard to anticipate. that doesn’t mean that daos have to be chaotic. just because we don’t know the exact destination, doesn’t mean we can’t steer at all.\n\nstrategy can exist in daos, the difference relative to corporate strategy is that dao strategy is co-created by contributors rather than set from the top-down. the simplest way to do this is via collectively authored charters (see [here](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Metagovernance-Pod-v0-Charter-FINAL-b289ebc63e44456bae1a17987f1a57b8)) that serve as a mutable guide outlining high-level goals, suggested processes, and guiding principles to inform decision making over a season. these charters maximize contributor scope within a “container,” providing a collectively agreed upon roadmap that defines *what* needs to be accomplished while allowing contributors to determine *how* they arrive at the intended destination. allowing for re-evaluation and updates to charters at regular intervals is important since much of how a dao operates is discovered through day-to-day experience ([twoirrtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896222971879437))\n\n> **while dao visions are collectively discovered over time, dao strategy should be collectively set at regular intervals**\n\nwhile contributors want the ability to shape strategy, i’ve found that they also don’t want to be handed a completely blank slate. at RabbitHole, we found the optimal balance in providing an initial charter outlining \\~70% of what a working group will drive towards and empowering the community to provide feedback and fill in the rest.\n\n## **Agency**\n\n*autonomy is present at the organizational/dao level while agency is present at the individual contributor level*\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to take action or to choose what action to take ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/agency)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in traditional corporations, top level management holds most of the agency. in daos, all network participants maximize agency*\n* **design principle:** *daos need to be designed with the understanding that individual contributors will optimize for agency via voice and exit*\n\n### 1.) Voice (change the system from within)\n\ngovernance gives contributors *the option* to have a voice in decision making. while most governance conversations focus on how to increase voter participation, *having the option* to vote is actually more important than constantly voting. if contributors have the option to effectuate change, but don’t choose it, they have nobody to blame. if they do exercise the option, they feel empowered by the agency to influence their own destiny. since the option is more important than the action, the expectation should *not* be that every tokenholder votes on every vote. most everyday users don’t want to participate in democracy for the products they use each day. even if they wanted to, it’s a full time job to keep up with all proposals and so quorum is usually only met on the most controversial proposals. once we accept that option to vote is more important than the action of voting, we can stop applying a one-size-fits-all decision making model to governance. this will allow us to make more effective decisions, which is one of the two primary purposes of daos (along with collective ownership.)\n\n![](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1488584926903607300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1488584926903607300%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fchaserchapman%2Fstatus%2F1488584926903607300image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\nwhat effective decision making comes down to is empowering high context people to make localized decisions while granting everyone else the option to protest when/if needed. if we design for agency, we can start experimenting more with consent-based governance (see [Mirror 0004](https://dao.mirror.xyz/U91KFBfSmWCjJar4-tflQBSQK1H0IVTOMheSPrHvU0Q)), optimistic governance (see [Aragon](https://aragon.org/aragon-govern) and [Tribe](https://twitter.com/joey__santoro/status/1513555100618264577?s=21&t=KuJC02BF-hTlhp5iqEuJ0g)), and lazy consensus (see [Colony](https://colony.io/)) and we can start to think about differing voting rights based on identity, reputation, and contribution (See [Element](https://medium.com/element-finance/voting-vaults-a-new-defi-and-governance-primitive-b4b2f6289d48?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------)).\n\n![Dan Wu: https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1499859953594642439?cxt=HHwWjsC9rcyrydApAAAA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MNcv3BD01WNjqoSl)\n\n### 2.) Exit (leave to create start a new system or join a competitor)\n\npart of the beauty of daos is the fluidity of participation and the ability to work, on a part-time basis, for multiple daos at once. it also means that exit is an easier option for contributors than it is at a traditional corporation. core teams should be prepared to fill in any gaps created by a primarily part-time contributor base that may frequently choose exit. maintaining continuity of work when turnover is high increases the need for thorough and transparent process documentation and clearly outlined strategies. you probably don’t want to evaluate your dao on retention. instead, focus on ratifying co-created policies and processes that allow any contributor to plug into well defined, yet flexible, and well documented workflows, reducing dependency on any one contributor without adding top-down bureaucracy.\n\n## **Transparency**\n\n* **what it means:** *the quality of being done in an open way without secrets ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/transparency))*\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** daos redefine the meaning of “radical transparency” in a way that would severely rattle private corporations\n* **design principle:** *design for nearly complete transparency and higher levels of accountability relative to traditional organizations*\n\nwhile public corporations make some data transparent, they do so in a highly edited format, released at infrequent intervals. in contrast, all the raw data pertaining to on-chain actions of a dao is publicly viewable, in its entirety, in real time. contributors expect a similar level of transparency for all off-chain data and decision making. providing this level of transparency into off-chain actions is where many daos fall short and run into conflict.\n\nthe purpose of transparency in corporations and daos is also different. the purpose of corporate transparency is *to inform* shareholders about decisions that have already been made. the purpose of dao transparency is *to enable* contributors to make decisions. this makes transparency all the more important in daos as information asymmetry actually prevents contributors from fulfilling their role ([chase chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman)). however, this level of transparency also means that dao operators will be held accountable 24/7. contributors will expect rapid responses and open communication at all times. at the same time, anonymity among the contributor base provides less transparency and lowers accountability. since the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise, it will get rough in the Discord. dao operators need mental health benefits and support. burnout is extremely common among community managers, but it’s also preventable. while complete transparency seems like the simplest property to design for, it has the most underestimated impact on dao operators.\n\n\n---\n\nit’s completely mindblowing what a group of internet strangers can do when empowered by collective ownership and decision making. we can accomplish even more if we start designing daos in a way that embraces their unique properties: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, and Transparency. If these properties will be disruptive to what you’re trying to achieve, a dao might not be the best structure to accomplish your goal.\n\n![this ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/07hzyQ9M06VL24xNYakkc.png?height=307&width=921)\n\nwe’re still figuring out what great dao design looks like and we have a long way to go. daos are constantly evolving, so the best approach today may not be the best approach tomorrow. i still believe these design principles are useful, even if we disagree about them, because they start a conversation that hopefully moves us all forward, together, and isn’t that the whole point anyway?\n\n\n---\n\nIf you liked my thoughts on daos, check out my earlier thoughts on [DeFi](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16), [DeFi 2.0](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26), and [Web3 Social](https://justine.mirror.xyz/dQtmHWtUcUsb_-rUtOgc8fzCn5z6lw1cLoMcswykV3I)\n\nThanks to [pet3rpan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) for discussions on this topic and for feedback from: [Diana Chen](https://twitter.com/ddwchen), [Chase Chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Meg Lister](https://twitter.com/MegLister), [Ben Schecter](https://twitter.com/benschecter), and [Vishal Kankani](https://twitter.com/kankanivishal)", "timestamp": 1657242766, "digest": "ITRTe2OKz4BALnDe9vMhzGfrSCS16G-nu6mOaIoNx_o", "contributor": "0x30Cf218b751f0204d906962798d6d6251AE67eF4"}

{"id": "Aup0W54cs6MlCxXaqoFulq65L0C-OkHhT35pMqNW2pQ", "title": "The Evolution of DeFi Across Four Financial Primitives", "body": "![Photo by Hello I’m Nik on Unsplash](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*zHy-hDv8Eu4dviMc)\n\n*\\*originally [published](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26) on May 5th, 2021*\n\nWhile still experimental, DeFi has matured enormously since I first [wrote about it](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16) in June 2019. As DeFi protocols roll out v2s and v3s, I took a fresh look at the industry and how it is evolving. After many years in finance, I’ve realized most of what moves markets comes down to four financial primitives: liquidity, leverage, risk, and arbitrage. This article outlines the evolution of DeFi through the lens of each.\n\nThis article outlines *financial* *primitives,* or the core building blocks of financial markets, which are distinct from *software* or *cryptographic primitives.* This article assumes some knowledge of finance, crypto, and DeFi and is not comprehensive in its coverage of protocols.\n\n## Financial Primitive 1: Liquidity\n\n*Almost everything comes down to [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp), but we consistently underestimate its importance. Higher liquidity results in tighter spreads and greater [market efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp#:\\~:text=Market%20efficiency%20refers%20to%20the,undervalued%20or%20overvalued%20securities%20available.). Lower liquidity exaggerates market movements and amplifies sell-offs. It creates a flywheel on the way up but a cliff on the way down.*\n\nv1 DeFi was a liquidity vacuum that relied on captive capital. The term captive capital refers to underutilized capital locked in protocols or inefficiently allocated within them. It results in opportunity costs as this capital could otherwise earn higher returns, either inside or outside of the protocol. The first DeFi protocols depended on captive capital: [MakerDAO ](https://makerdao.com/en/)required a minimum 150% collateralization ratio, lending protocols had not yet embraced [superfluid collateral](https://tokeneconomy.co/superfluid-collateral-in-open-finance-8c3db15efac) (a v2 innovation led by [Compound](https://compound.finance/)), and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)’s liquidity was inefficiently distributed across a -∞ to ∞ price curve.\n\n> ***The opportunity cost of captive capital scaled along with DeFi and now v2s and v3s are fighting to achieve greater capital efficiency.***\n\n### Collateral as Liquidity\n\nStablecoins play an enormous role in DeFi. Fiat-backed stablecoins are problematic (centralization, regulation, potential competition from CBDCs) and cryptocollateralized stablecoins present the most viable alternative. However, v1s relied on overcollateralization to maintain their peg and haven’t been able to scale. Purely algorithmic, uncollateralized stablecoins have never performed as intended and v2 attempts seem subject to the same shortcomings (incentive mechanisms that perform well above the peg, but not below).\n\nMany of the latest iterations of stablecoins ([FEI](https://fei.money/), [OHM](https://olympusdao.eth.link/#/), [FLOAT](https://www.floatprotocol.com/#/stake), **[FRAX](https://frax.finance/)**) leverage protocol controlled value (PCV). This is a concept in which the collateral backing a stablecoin is not redeemable by users but rather is owned by the protocol (which decides whether/how to invest it, can use it to restore the peg, etc.) This is similar to a treasury or insurance fund, but is distinct in that PCV can be immediately converted into liquidity (an [AMM](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers) pool). Launch issues aside, [FEI](https://fei.money/)’s PCV enabled it to become the largest liquidity provider (LP) on [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/). [Aave](https://docs.aave.com/faq/swap-and-repay-with-collateral-v2#:\\~:text=In%20Aave%20V2%20you%20have,loans%20with%20your%20deposited%20collateral.) v2 similarly blurs the line between collateral and liquidity by allowing borrowers to pay off their debt with existing collateral. [Proof of Liquidity](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/5/22/proof-of-liquidity) creates a similar dynamic for staking derivatives, which are covered in more detail below.\n\n> ***DeFi v1 figured out how to use liquidity as collateral (LP tokens). v2 and v3 protocols are figuring out how to convert collateral into liquidity.***\n\nUnfortunately, liquidity alone does not result in stability. The real reason stablecoins collapse is a crisis of confidence below the peg. Addressing captive capital is not sufficient. Sound economic mechanisms are required to keep the stablecoin near its peg over time, and mechanism design is hard. Purely algorithmic stablecoins ([Basis Cash](https://basis.cash/), [Empty Set Dollar](https://www.emptyset.finance/)) have struggled with mechanisms that require confidence in the future peg exactly when the present peg is failing. So-called [Direct Incentives](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/what-you-should-know-about-fei-3ccffd4a4bb6), which penalize trades away from the peg and reward trades towards the peg, end up pulling liquidity out of the system at the exact moment it’s most needed.¹⁰ Severe sell penalties mimic constrained liquidity and keep more capital captive, which is the problem we’re trying to solve in the first place. Other models attempt to solve for confidence first and improve capital efficiency over time, beginning with a fully collateralized token and letting the market adjust the collateralization ratio dynamically. As confidence goes up, so does capital efficiency. [FRAX](https://frax.finance/) uses this model, but is currently backed by a basket of fiat-backed stablecoins. While the mechanism appears to be working, it’s unclear how it would hold up were it exclusively collateralized by uncensorable assets.\n\n> ***While the newest generation of stablecoins are focused on lowering collateralization requirements, we need to solve for confidence in the peg (effective mechanism design) before capital efficiency.***\n\n### Liquidity as a Liability\n\nWe can’t talk about liquidity without talking about [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), the dominant AMM. Uniswap played an important role in the rise of [yield farming](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-yield-farming-comp-token-explained) and [liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641#:\\~:text=Liquidity%20mining%20is%20a%20network,for%20that%20protocol%27s%20native%20token.), which, in turn, played an important role in Uniswap’s trajectory. After we learned ([the hard way](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/sushiswaps-vampire-scheme-hours-away)) that [liquidity is not a moat](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/fork-defense-strategies-in-defi/), the focus moved from acquiring it to retaining it. Competing AMMs began moving up the stack to add higher moat/margin services like lending ([Kashi Lending](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/introducing-kashi-lending-margin-trading-on-sushiswaps-bentobox-eb91286f6910)), borrowing a page from traditional fintech: acquire users cheaply and upsell credit products. Instead, Uniswap fundamentally rethought the AMM liquidity mechanism, resulting in a v3 that improves capital efficiency by up to 4000x, in special cases.⁷\n\nWhile v1 AMMs were a [0 to 1 innovation](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/constant-function-market-makers-defis-zero-to-one-innovation-968f77022159), they were also inefficient since they required liquidity for prices that might never be reached. For example, if ETH were in the $200 range, and there was $10M in an ETH/DAI pool, up to 25% of the liquidity pool might exist for buying ETH below $10 or above $5,000.⁵ In this example, it is highly unlikely that liquidity would be needed at those levels. Maintaining this constant price curve resulted in low turnover (\\~20%) as $5B in locked capital translates to only $1B in volume.¹ The even spread of liquidity over the entire range also means that very little liquidity is concentrated where a pair does most of its trading. [Curve](https://curve.fi/) recognized this early on, creating an AMM specifically for stablecoins, which are designed to trade in a tight range.\n\nUniswap v3 addresses these issues and, in the process, moves closer to a limit order book in that LPs can now specify a price range over which to provide liquidity (ie. ETH/USDC from $1800 to $2200). This change should result in almost all trading occurring in a few buckets around the mid-market price, improving liquidity where it’s most needed. More concentrated liquidity should also reduce inventory risk, which results in both wasted capital and exposure to assets that LPs don’t want to hold. For example, if an LP posts $500 for an ETH/DAI pair but is confident that the ETH price will go up, then they’ve taken on exposure to an asset (DAI) that they don’t want to hold (ETH opportunity cost) and are holding $500 of DAI only to buy ETH as it falls, which they think is unlikely. Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity provision reduces this risk by enabling LPs to significantly increase their exposure to preferred assets.¹³ [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) v2 also attempts to reduce inventory risk by introducing [Asset Managers](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-partners-with-aave-to-build-the-first-v2-asset-manager-d9c173330151), which allow LPs to lend out one side of a pair when it’s not being used as swap liquidity. [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [Stablecredit](https://docs.yearn.finance/r-and-d/stablecredit) utilizes a similar functionality.\n\n> ***The next generation of AMMs require less capital but result in more liquidity.***\n\n### Liquidity Trade-offs\n\n[Superfluid collateral](https://tokeneconomy.co/superfluid-collateral-in-open-finance-8c3db15efac) is a v1 concept that refers to the ability to tokenize locked capital (collateral or liquidity) in order to access liquidity or gain leverage on that capital. Staking derivatives extend this concept to staked assets (assets that secure [proof-of-stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp) networks) via stake tokens ([stETH](https://lido.fi/), [rtokens](https://www.stafi.io/rToken)) that essentially allow staked capital to be deployed more productively elsewhere. Proponents of staking derivatives argue that without them, network token liquidity will suffer as a large portion of outstanding supply will remain captive. There are also concerns that validators won’t be incentivized to stake if/when they can earn higher returns on capital deposited elsewhere (DeFi protocols). In theory, staking derivatives could increase the percentage of ETH staked from 15–30% to 80–100%, since it removes the additional costs of staking compared to not staking.¹⁴\n\nStaking derivatives also allow for the creation of new financial instruments. For example, the cash flows “guaranteed” by proof-of-stake rewards can enable products that look similar to coupon-bearing bonds ([Terra](https://terra.money/)’s bAssets, [Blockswap](https://www.blockswap.network/)). These instruments can be used to generate sustainable, stable, and relatively high yields (as in [Anchor Protocol](https://anchorprotocol.com/)), which may onboard more mainstream users to DeFi.\n\nHowever, staked assets are unique from collateral in that they are not just a promise to pay, but rather they are a security mechanism. I would like to see more research on the associated security costs, but it’s clear that design matters. Some designs, particularly those that enable staking derivatives to move cross-chain, allow for a transformation of risk (from [endogenous](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenous-variable.asp) to [exogenous](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenous-variable.asp)) that could impact the underlying game theory that helps secure public networks.¹¹ In contrast, [Proof of Liquidity](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/5/22/proof-of-liquidity) converts staked capital into liquidity for the underlying network token in a way that balances capital efficiency and network security, which should be the main priority.\n\n## Financial Primitive 2: Leverage\n\n*[Leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) amplifies gains (it’s the ultimate in capital efficiency) but also dramatically accelerates losses. Creating leverage is easy, controlling it is hard. We love it, until we hate it.*\n\nThere have been countless TradFi market crashes due to excessive and/or hidden leverage. In the last six months alone, we saw the market impact of [Archegos](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/leveraged-blowout-how-hwang-s-archegos-blindsided-global-banks) (which was highly levered) and the Gamestop levered short squeeze ([140% of Gamestop’s float was sold short](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qjp3jmnxyf73/Short-Sellers-Still-Love-to-Hate-GameStop#:\\~:text=About%2033%20percent%20of%20GSX%27s,added%20during%20the%20past%20week.)). In the crypto markets, we recently saw [$10B in liquidations in 24 hours](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-futures-saw-record-10b-worth-of-liquidations-on-sunday#:\\~:text=31%20a.m.%20PDT-,Crypto%20Futures%20Saw%20Record%20%2410B%20Worth%20of%20Liquidations%20on,caught%20overleveraged%20traders%20off%20guard.), in part due to [cascading liquidations](https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda/status/1238306312229761025) of leveraged long positions. This served as a sort of stress test for the crypto markets, and some DeFi protocols were [pretty stressed](https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1383655305058217988).\n\n> ***Leverage is easy in DeFi , controlling it is still hard.***\n\n### Creating Leverage\n\nMuch of the frenzied activity during the DeFi Summer of 2020 was driven by active leverage strategies that relied on recursive [yield farming](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-yield-farming-comp-token-explained) and [liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641). While this activity has died down since then, we are starting to see new leverage mechanisms emerge. [Element](https://element.fi/)’s [Yield Token Compounding](https://medium.com/element-finance/unlocking-capital-efficiency-a-defi-users-journey-through-element-d0a689f2a894) is one example. When a user deposits collateral via Element, two tokens are minted: a principal token and a yield token. Let’s say a user deposited principal of 10 ETH at 20% APY. The token holder can sell the principal token at a discount. At a fixed rate yield of 10%, they would receive 9 ETH while maintaining exposure to the interest paid on all 10 ETH over time via the yield token. The user could then open a new position with the remaining 9 ETH and repeat, achieving up to 6.5x leverage.³ The ability to earn interest on the *full* principal amount, while being able to access the loan’s [NPV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp), is unique relative to earlier lending protocols.\n\nWhile there have been several protocols that aimed to achieve undercollateralized lending in DeFi, it remains mostly conceptual. While [CREAM](https://app.cream.finance/) v2 strives to achieve zero-collateral protocol-to-protocol lending via the [Iron Bank](https://creamdotfinance.medium.com/introducing-the-iron-bank-bab9417c9a), it’s only available to whitelisted partners and parameters will be determined directly by the CREAM team, highlighting current limitations. Instead, [Alchemix](https://alchemix.fi/) approaches the problem from a completely different angle, allowing borrowers to benefit from overcollateralization. For example, a user that deposits 1000 DAI can access 500 alUSD. The 1000 DAI is put into a Yearn vault to earn yield, which is used to pay down the loan over time. The alternative would be to make an upfront purchase of $500 and then invest the unspent $500, which will obviously earn less yield than $1000 would ($280 less, assuming a 25% APY over 2 years).¹⁵ Again, borrowers benefit from earning interest on the *full* principal amount while still being able to access a discounted portion of the principal.\n\n> ***New lending protocols utilize the time value of money and the separation of principal and yield to allow users to benefit from (over)collateralization.***\n\n### Cross-Collateral Complexity\n\nWhile the early DeFi ecosystem relied mostly on recursive loops denominated in one asset (ETH), v2s expanded the complexity of lending protocols by allowing for multi-collateral systems, in which *n* assets can be borrowed against *m* collateral. Single-Collateral Dai evolved into Multi-Collateral Dai, [Compound](https://compound.finance/) supported cross-collateral money markets, which [Aave](https://aave.com/) and [CREAM](https://app.cream.finance/) expanded on by supporting more and more assets. [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [StableCredit](https://medium.com/iearn/introducing-stablecredit-a-new-protocol-for-decentralized-lending-stablecoins-and-amms-7252a43ee56) protocol allows users to mint synthetic debt positions to essentially swap collateral ([functionality](https://docs.aave.com/faq/swap-and-repay-with-collateral-v2#:\\~:text=In%20Aave%20V2%20you%20have,loans%20with%20your%20deposited%20collateral.) which Aave v2 supports via [flash loans](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-a-flash-loan)). Some protocols take it a step further and pool exposure to all of these assets, spreading counterparty risk across users. On [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), when the value of any synthetic asset minted on the protocol increases, it raises the value of total debt in the system, while a user’s ownership of the total debt pool remains constant. This can result in outcomes where a user’s debt balance increases due to a price increase of an asset to which they have no direct exposure.² This cross-collateral complexity and cross-asset exposure improves functionality but also increases the likelihood of market contagion, whereby a sell-off in one asset causes a sell-off in others.\n\n### Controlling Leverage\n\nComposability enables rapid innovation, but it also means that money legos can quickly become money dominos. Despite on-chain transparency, the difficulty of creating a cohesive view of leverage compounded across protocols means there is currently no easy way to understand how much credit is [commodity credit versus circulation credit](https://mises.org/wire/mises-explains-difference-between-circulation-credit-and-commodity-credit),⁹ which has implications for the solvency of the system. Solvency is particularly important in a system that, by design, has no lender of last resort. Additionally, while centralized venues liquidate underwater collateral themselves, avoiding counterparty risk, decentralized protocols rely on third-party liquidators to remove underwater debt from their balance sheets. These liquidators can choose to purchase underwater collateral from the protocol at a discount, but they can also choose not to, due to volatility, network congestion, and/or other market factors.¹² [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) attempts to overcome this issue by creating a pool of funds that can be used for liquidations. In this model, LPs agree in advance that their liquidity will be used to buy collateral at a discount during liquidation periods. While this enables the protocol to lower loan collateralization ratios to 110% and offer a fixed rate of 0% interest, LPs could end up buying collateral as prices are falling, which could come at a much higher cost.\n\n## Financial Primitive 3: Risk\n\n*There is one ratio that is nearly inescapable in finance: risk/reward. The idea is simple: higher returns require more risk. With one exception (financial primitive 4), it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to break this ratio.*\n\nWhen markets are new, risk is mostly expressed in binary terms: [risk-on or risk-off](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-on-risk-off.asp). As markets evolve, and the composition of risk is better understood, risk transfer mechanisms develop, as does a sliding scale of risk that allows market participants to express individual risk tolerance.\n\n### Binary Risk\n\nVolatility products allow market participants to take a binary view on market risk and are a critical piece of market infrastructure. The [VIX](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp), an index representing the market’s estimate of future volatility, is a cornerstone of traditional financial markets. CeFi markets already offer some vol products ([FTX ](https://about.ftx.com/)[MOVE](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033136331-MOVE-contracts)), but DeFi markets have few equivalents. Protocols like [Volmex](https://volmex.finance/) are working to create a volatility index while [Benchmark Protocol](https://benchmarkprotocol.finance/)’s stablecoin uses the VIX as an input to its stability mechanism. [INDEX Coop](https://www.indexcoop.com/) seems like a natural candidate for a DeFi native volatility index and [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/#/trade?options=eth) [has expressed interest](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9sS21RREc5Ug/episode/YjEzNDIzMGEtY2JkYi00OTQ2LTkzMDctZjM5NzlmODg2NTQ4?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjDiaX984rwAhUITawKHWA3B6AQjrkEegQIAxAL&ep=6) in creating a “DeFi VIX” as well.\n\n### Risk on a Sliding Scale\n\nEmerging DeFi protocols are developing “risk-matching engines” to pair market participants that prefer less risk with those that prefer more. Most are approaching this via multi-token systems that separate speculative versus non-speculative aspects of a protocol and redistribute cash flows accordingly ([Saffron](https://saffron.finance/), [BarnBridge](https://barnbridge.com/), [Element](https://element.fi/)). For example, [Element](https://element.fi/) splits principal and yield, allowing users to purchase the NPV of the principal (basically a zero-coupon bond) or take up to 10x leveraged exposure to the yield.⁸ [BarnBridge](https://barnbridge.com/) splits cash flows into fixed yield and variable yield. Variable yield holders get upside above a fixed rate but subsidize the fixed yield token holders in the case of a shortfall. Similarly, [Saffron](https://saffron.finance/) splits risk into senior and junior tranches. Senior tranches except lower yields in exchange for coverage from junior tranches in the event that things go south. More yield = more risk.\n\nThese programmable risk protocols enable peer-to-peer risk transfer and allow users to bet on different parts of the capital structure. Risk-averse capital (like corporate treasuries) may prefer to buy the senior tranche, while [Degens](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/degen) chasing yield may prefer junior tranches. Greater expressivity of risk tolerance is a positive development for DeFi markets and there is nothing inherently dangerous about tranching.\n\n> ***Risk tranches have become toxic in the past, namely when they’ve tried to circumvent the risk/reward ratio. The [CDO²](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo2.asp) will forever be my favorite example of clever financial engineering, packaged to look like a riskless instrument when it was actually full of risk.***\n\n## Financial Primitive 4: Arbitrage\n\n*There is one important exception to the risk/reward ratio and that is [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp). Arbitrage creates (theoretically) riskless profit opportunities and it plays a critical role in price discovery, **which** is one of the things smart contract platforms are best suited for.⁴ The [Kimchi premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kimchi-premium.asp) is a perfect example. Buy an asset for $55,000 in the U.S. and sell the same asset for $65,000 in South Korea. Riskless profit.*\n\nArbitrage is required for many DeFi protocols to function properly and needs to be considered in the design of any protocol. [Uniswap ](https://uniswap.org/)is heavily reliant on arbitrageurs to maintain price discovery. Arbitrageurs rebalance portfolios on [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/). Some [argu](https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484)e that [MakerDAO’s ](https://makerdao.com/en/)scale is limited due to the infeasibility of arbitraging [CDP](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateralized-debt-position-cdp)s. Miners on [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co/) are incentivized to mine on the chain by arbitraging the BTC-STX rate.⁶ [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [StableCredit](https://docs.yearn.finance/r-and-d/stablecredit) relies on arbitrage rather than governance to maintain stability in the system. [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ParaSwap](https://paraswap.io/#/), and [Rari](https://rari.capital/) can all be used as vehicles for arbitrage. [ThorChain](https://thorchain.org/) and [Serum](https://dex.projectserum.com/#/market/AtNnsY1AyRERWJ8xCskfz38YdvruWVJQUVXgScC1iPb) will be crucial to enabling cross-chain arbitrage as DeFi protocols launch across Layer 1s. As DeFi struggles to scale, avoidance of gas costs will present a temporary arbitrage opportunity, which is increasingly shaping v2/v3 design ([Aave](https://aave.com/) v2 [collateral swaps](https://medium.com/aave/the-aave-protocol-v2-f06f299cee04), [dydx](https://dydx.exchange/)’s gasless order book, [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) v2s pooled assets, [Sushiswap](https://sushi.com/)’s [BentoBox](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/introducing-kashi-lending-margin-trading-on-sushiswaps-bentobox-eb91286f6910)).\n\n> ***v1s focused on cross-protocol arbitrage, v2s/v3s are focusing on chain-cross arbitrage***\n\nArbitrage increases [market efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp) (the degree to which market prices reflect all available, relevant information) but it also results in narrower spreads and normalized yields, eliminating temporary advantages between protocols. As market efficiency increases, so does competition. True protocol innovation, and not just incrementalism, will be required to maintain dominance in this environment.\n\n\n---\n\nv2 and v3 DeFi protocols will need to innovate across all four financial primitives, as their interconnected nature is what drives markets. Without arbitrage, stablecoins can’t scale. Without liquidity, there is no ability to arbitrage. Leverage lets you take more risk, and risk transfer can let you take on more leverage. Importantly, DeFi enables entirely new financial primitives, such as flash loans, that have no traditional counterpart. Protocols that solve for all of these primitives, and/or that create novel ones, will lead the way for the next generation of DeFi. I can’t wait to see v4 and v5.\n\n\n---\n\nCompare to my earlier thoughts on [DeFi: What it Is and Isn’t](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16) and get in [touch](https://twitter.com/j_humenansky)!\n\nThank you to [Alex Pruden](https://medium.com/u/e1ca31caefb9?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------), [Eddy Lazzarin](https://medium.com/u/2051feec12f2?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------), [Dmitriy Berenzon](https://medium.com/u/a25f7c81672d?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------) and [Luca Cosentino](https://medium.com/u/effdd16050cd?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------) for feedback.\n\n## References\n\n 1.

{"id": "CAbg9cPty9hNUhV2twGoyoR2Qpkn_vmbZBkW-COmjf4", "title": "The Evolution of DeFi Across Four Financial Primitives", "body": "![Photo by Hello I’m Nik on Unsplash](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*zHy-hDv8Eu4dviMc)\n\n*\\*originally [published](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26) on May 5th, 2021*\n\nWhile still experimental, DeFi has matured enormously since I first [wrote about it](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16) in June 2019. As DeFi protocols roll out v2s and v3s, I took a fresh look at the industry and how it is evolving. After many years in finance, I’ve realized most of what moves markets comes down to four financial primitives: liquidity, leverage, risk, and arbitrage. This article outlines the evolution of DeFi through the lens of each.\n\nThis article outlines *financial* *primitives,* or the core building blocks of financial markets, which are distinct from *software* or *cryptographic primitives.* This article assumes some knowledge of finance, crypto, and DeFi and is not comprehensive in its coverage of protocols.\n\n## Financial Primitive 1: Liquidity\n\n*Almost everything comes down to [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp), but we consistently underestimate its importance. Higher liquidity results in tighter spreads and greater [market efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp#:\\~:text=Market%20efficiency%20refers%20to%20the,undervalued%20or%20overvalued%20securities%20available.). Lower liquidity exaggerates market movements and amplifies sell-offs. It creates a flywheel on the way up but a cliff on the way down.*\n\nv1 DeFi was a liquidity vacuum that relied on captive capital. The term captive capital refers to underutilized capital locked in protocols or inefficiently allocated within them. It results in opportunity costs as this capital could otherwise earn higher returns, either inside or outside of the protocol. The first DeFi protocols depended on captive capital: [MakerDAO ](https://makerdao.com/en/)required a minimum 150% collateralization ratio, lending protocols had not yet embraced [superfluid collateral](https://tokeneconomy.co/superfluid-collateral-in-open-finance-8c3db15efac) (a v2 innovation led by [Compound](https://compound.finance/)), and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)’s liquidity was inefficiently distributed across a -∞ to ∞ price curve.\n\n> ***The opportunity cost of captive capital scaled along with DeFi and now v2s and v3s are fighting to achieve greater capital efficiency.***\n\n### Collateral as Liquidity\n\nStablecoins play an enormous role in DeFi. Fiat-backed stablecoins are problematic (centralization, regulation, potential competition from CBDCs) and cryptocollateralized stablecoins present the most viable alternative. However, v1s relied on overcollateralization to maintain their peg and haven’t been able to scale. Purely algorithmic, uncollateralized stablecoins have never performed as intended and v2 attempts seem subject to the same shortcomings (incentive mechanisms that perform well above the peg, but not below).\n\nMany of the latest iterations of stablecoins ([FEI](https://fei.money/), [OHM](https://olympusdao.eth.link/#/), [FLOAT](https://www.floatprotocol.com/#/stake), **[FRAX](https://frax.finance/)**) leverage protocol controlled value (PCV). This is a concept in which the collateral backing a stablecoin is not redeemable by users but rather is owned by the protocol (which decides whether/how to invest it, can use it to restore the peg, etc.) This is similar to a treasury or insurance fund, but is distinct in that PCV can be immediately converted into liquidity (an [AMM](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers) pool). Launch issues aside, [FEI](https://fei.money/)’s PCV enabled it to become the largest liquidity provider (LP) on [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/). [Aave](https://docs.aave.com/faq/swap-and-repay-with-collateral-v2#:\\~:text=In%20Aave%20V2%20you%20have,loans%20with%20your%20deposited%20collateral.) v2 similarly blurs the line between collateral and liquidity by allowing borrowers to pay off their debt with existing collateral. [Proof of Liquidity](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/5/22/proof-of-liquidity) creates a similar dynamic for staking derivatives, which are covered in more detail below.\n\n> ***DeFi v1 figured out how to use liquidity as collateral (LP tokens). v2 and v3 protocols are figuring out how to convert collateral into liquidity.***\n\nUnfortunately, liquidity alone does not result in stability. The real reason stablecoins collapse is a crisis of confidence below the peg. Addressing captive capital is not sufficient. Sound economic mechanisms are required to keep the stablecoin near its peg over time, and mechanism design is hard. Purely algorithmic stablecoins ([Basis Cash](https://basis.cash/), [Empty Set Dollar](https://www.emptyset.finance/)) have struggled with mechanisms that require confidence in the future peg exactly when the present peg is failing. So-called [Direct Incentives](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/what-you-should-know-about-fei-3ccffd4a4bb6), which penalize trades away from the peg and reward trades towards the peg, end up pulling liquidity out of the system at the exact moment it’s most needed.¹⁰ Severe sell penalties mimic constrained liquidity and keep more capital captive, which is the problem we’re trying to solve in the first place. Other models attempt to solve for confidence first and improve capital efficiency over time, beginning with a fully collateralized token and letting the market adjust the collateralization ratio dynamically. As confidence goes up, so does capital efficiency. [FRAX](https://frax.finance/) uses this model, but is currently backed by a basket of fiat-backed stablecoins. While the mechanism appears to be working, it’s unclear how it would hold up were it exclusively collateralized by uncensorable assets.\n\n> ***While the newest generation of stablecoins are focused on lowering collateralization requirements, we need to solve for confidence in the peg (effective mechanism design) before capital efficiency.***\n\n### Liquidity as a Liability\n\nWe can’t talk about liquidity without talking about [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), the dominant AMM. Uniswap played an important role in the rise of [yield farming](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-yield-farming-comp-token-explained) and [liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641#:\\~:text=Liquidity%20mining%20is%20a%20network,for%20that%20protocol%27s%20native%20token.), which, in turn, played an important role in Uniswap’s trajectory. After we learned ([the hard way](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/sushiswaps-vampire-scheme-hours-away)) that [liquidity is not a moat](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/fork-defense-strategies-in-defi/), the focus moved from acquiring it to retaining it. Competing AMMs began moving up the stack to add higher moat/margin services like lending ([Kashi Lending](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/introducing-kashi-lending-margin-trading-on-sushiswaps-bentobox-eb91286f6910)), borrowing a page from traditional fintech: acquire users cheaply and upsell credit products. Instead, Uniswap fundamentally rethought the AMM liquidity mechanism, resulting in a v3 that improves capital efficiency by up to 4000x, in special cases.⁷\n\nWhile v1 AMMs were a [0 to 1 innovation](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/constant-function-market-makers-defis-zero-to-one-innovation-968f77022159), they were also inefficient since they required liquidity for prices that might never be reached. For example, if ETH were in the $200 range, and there was $10M in an ETH/DAI pool, up to 25% of the liquidity pool might exist for buying ETH below $10 or above $5,000.⁵ In this example, it is highly unlikely that liquidity would be needed at those levels. Maintaining this constant price curve resulted in low turnover (\\~20%) as $5B in locked capital translates to only $1B in volume.¹ The even spread of liquidity over the entire range also means that very little liquidity is concentrated where a pair does most of its trading. [Curve](https://curve.fi/) recognized this early on, creating an AMM specifically for stablecoins, which are designed to trade in a tight range.\n\nUniswap v3 addresses these issues and, in the process, moves closer to a limit order book in that LPs can now specify a price range over which to provide liquidity (ie. ETH/USDC from $1800 to $2200). This change should result in almost all trading occurring in a few buckets around the mid-market price, improving liquidity where it’s most needed. More concentrated liquidity should also reduce inventory risk, which results in both wasted capital and exposure to assets that LPs don’t want to hold. For example, if an LP posts $500 for an ETH/DAI pair but is confident that the ETH price will go up, then they’ve taken on exposure to an asset (DAI) that they don’t want to hold (ETH opportunity cost) and are holding $500 of DAI only to buy ETH as it falls, which they think is unlikely. Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity provision reduces this risk by enabling LPs to significantly increase their exposure to preferred assets.¹³ [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) v2 also attempts to reduce inventory risk by introducing [Asset Managers](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-partners-with-aave-to-build-the-first-v2-asset-manager-d9c173330151), which allow LPs to lend out one side of a pair when it’s not being used as swap liquidity. [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [Stablecredit](https://docs.yearn.finance/r-and-d/stablecredit) utilizes a similar functionality.\n\n> ***The next generation of AMMs require less capital but result in more liquidity.***\n\n### Liquidity Trade-offs\n\n[Superfluid collateral](https://tokeneconomy.co/superfluid-collateral-in-open-finance-8c3db15efac) is a v1 concept that refers to the ability to tokenize locked capital (collateral or liquidity) in order to access liquidity or gain leverage on that capital. Staking derivatives extend this concept to staked assets (assets that secure [proof-of-stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp) networks) via stake tokens ([stETH](https://lido.fi/), [rtokens](https://www.stafi.io/rToken)) that essentially allow staked capital to be deployed more productively elsewhere. Proponents of staking derivatives argue that without them, network token liquidity will suffer as a large portion of outstanding supply will remain captive. There are also concerns that validators won’t be incentivized to stake if/when they can earn higher returns on capital deposited elsewhere (DeFi protocols). In theory, staking derivatives could increase the percentage of ETH staked from 15–30% to 80–100%, since it removes the additional costs of staking compared to not staking.¹⁴\n\nStaking derivatives also allow for the creation of new financial instruments. For example, the cash flows “guaranteed” by proof-of-stake rewards can enable products that look similar to coupon-bearing bonds ([Terra](https://terra.money/)’s bAssets, [Blockswap](https://www.blockswap.network/)). These instruments can be used to generate sustainable, stable, and relatively high yields (as in [Anchor Protocol](https://anchorprotocol.com/)), which may onboard more mainstream users to DeFi.\n\nHowever, staked assets are unique from collateral in that they are not just a promise to pay, but rather they are a security mechanism. I would like to see more research on the associated security costs, but it’s clear that design matters. Some designs, particularly those that enable staking derivatives to move cross-chain, allow for a transformation of risk (from [endogenous](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenous-variable.asp) to [exogenous](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenous-variable.asp)) that could impact the underlying game theory that helps secure public networks.¹¹ In contrast, [Proof of Liquidity](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/5/22/proof-of-liquidity) converts staked capital into liquidity for the underlying network token in a way that balances capital efficiency and network security, which should be the main priority.\n\n## Financial Primitive 2: Leverage\n\n*[Leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) amplifies gains (it’s the ultimate in capital efficiency) but also dramatically accelerates losses. Creating leverage is easy, controlling it is hard. We love it, until we hate it.*\n\nThere have been countless TradFi market crashes due to excessive and/or hidden leverage. In the last six months alone, we saw the market impact of [Archegos](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/leveraged-blowout-how-hwang-s-archegos-blindsided-global-banks) (which was highly levered) and the Gamestop levered short squeeze ([140% of Gamestop’s float was sold short](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qjp3jmnxyf73/Short-Sellers-Still-Love-to-Hate-GameStop#:\\~:text=About%2033%20percent%20of%20GSX%27s,added%20during%20the%20past%20week.)). In the crypto markets, we recently saw [$10B in liquidations in 24 hours](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-futures-saw-record-10b-worth-of-liquidations-on-sunday#:\\~:text=31%20a.m.%20PDT-,Crypto%20Futures%20Saw%20Record%20%2410B%20Worth%20of%20Liquidations%20on,caught%20overleveraged%20traders%20off%20guard.), in part due to [cascading liquidations](https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda/status/1238306312229761025) of leveraged long positions. This served as a sort of stress test for the crypto markets, and some DeFi protocols were [pretty stressed](https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1383655305058217988).\n\n> ***Leverage is easy in DeFi , controlling it is still hard.***\n\n### Creating Leverage\n\nMuch of the frenzied activity during the DeFi Summer of 2020 was driven by active leverage strategies that relied on recursive [yield farming](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-yield-farming-comp-token-explained) and [liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641). While this activity has died down since then, we are starting to see new leverage mechanisms emerge. [Element](https://element.fi/)’s [Yield Token Compounding](https://medium.com/element-finance/unlocking-capital-efficiency-a-defi-users-journey-through-element-d0a689f2a894) is one example. When a user deposits collateral via Element, two tokens are minted: a principal token and a yield token. Let’s say a user deposited principal of 10 ETH at 20% APY. The token holder can sell the principal token at a discount. At a fixed rate yield of 10%, they would receive 9 ETH while maintaining exposure to the interest paid on all 10 ETH over time via the yield token. The user could then open a new position with the remaining 9 ETH and repeat, achieving up to 6.5x leverage.³ The ability to earn interest on the *full* principal amount, while being able to access the loan’s [NPV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp), is unique relative to earlier lending protocols.\n\nWhile there have been several protocols that aimed to achieve undercollateralized lending in DeFi, it remains mostly conceptual. While [CREAM](https://app.cream.finance/) v2 strives to achieve zero-collateral protocol-to-protocol lending via the [Iron Bank](https://creamdotfinance.medium.com/introducing-the-iron-bank-bab9417c9a), it’s only available to whitelisted partners and parameters will be determined directly by the CREAM team, highlighting current limitations. Instead, [Alchemix](https://alchemix.fi/) approaches the problem from a completely different angle, allowing borrowers to benefit from overcollateralization. For example, a user that deposits 1000 DAI can access 500 alUSD. The 1000 DAI is put into a Yearn vault to earn yield, which is used to pay down the loan over time. The alternative would be to make an upfront purchase of $500 and then invest the unspent $500, which will obviously earn less yield than $1000 would ($280 less, assuming a 25% APY over 2 years).¹⁵ Again, borrowers benefit from earning interest on the *full* principal amount while still being able to access a discounted portion of the principal.\n\n> ***New lending protocols utilize the time value of money and the separation of principal and yield to allow users to benefit from (over)collateralization.***\n\n### Cross-Collateral Complexity\n\nWhile the early DeFi ecosystem relied mostly on recursive loops denominated in one asset (ETH), v2s expanded the complexity of lending protocols by allowing for multi-collateral systems, in which *n* assets can be borrowed against *m* collateral. Single-Collateral Dai evolved into Multi-Collateral Dai, [Compound](https://compound.finance/) supported cross-collateral money markets, which [Aave](https://aave.com/) and [CREAM](https://app.cream.finance/) expanded on by supporting more and more assets. [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [StableCredit](https://medium.com/iearn/introducing-stablecredit-a-new-protocol-for-decentralized-lending-stablecoins-and-amms-7252a43ee56) protocol allows users to mint synthetic debt positions to essentially swap collateral ([functionality](https://docs.aave.com/faq/swap-and-repay-with-collateral-v2#:\\~:text=In%20Aave%20V2%20you%20have,loans%20with%20your%20deposited%20collateral.) which Aave v2 supports via [flash loans](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-a-flash-loan)). Some protocols take it a step further and pool exposure to all of these assets, spreading counterparty risk across users. On [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), when the value of any synthetic asset minted on the protocol increases, it raises the value of total debt in the system, while a user’s ownership of the total debt pool remains constant. This can result in outcomes where a user’s debt balance increases due to a price increase of an asset to which they have no direct exposure.² This cross-collateral complexity and cross-asset exposure improves functionality but also increases the likelihood of market contagion, whereby a sell-off in one asset causes a sell-off in others.\n\n### Controlling Leverage\n\nComposability enables rapid innovation, but it also means that money legos can quickly become money dominos. Despite on-chain transparency, the difficulty of creating a cohesive view of leverage compounded across protocols means there is currently no easy way to understand how much credit is [commodity credit versus circulation credit](https://mises.org/wire/mises-explains-difference-between-circulation-credit-and-commodity-credit),⁹ which has implications for the solvency of the system. Solvency is particularly important in a system that, by design, has no lender of last resort. Additionally, while centralized venues liquidate underwater collateral themselves, avoiding counterparty risk, decentralized protocols rely on third-party liquidators to remove underwater debt from their balance sheets. These liquidators can choose to purchase underwater collateral from the protocol at a discount, but they can also choose not to, due to volatility, network congestion, and/or other market factors.¹² [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) attempts to overcome this issue by creating a pool of funds that can be used for liquidations. In this model, LPs agree in advance that their liquidity will be used to buy collateral at a discount during liquidation periods. While this enables the protocol to lower loan collateralization ratios to 110% and offer a fixed rate of 0% interest, LPs could end up buying collateral as prices are falling, which could come at a much higher cost.\n\n## Financial Primitive 3: Risk\n\n*There is one ratio that is nearly inescapable in finance: risk/reward. The idea is simple: higher returns require more risk. With one exception (financial primitive 4), it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to break this ratio.*\n\nWhen markets are new, risk is mostly expressed in binary terms: [risk-on or risk-off](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-on-risk-off.asp). As markets evolve, and the composition of risk is better understood, risk transfer mechanisms develop, as does a sliding scale of risk that allows market participants to express individual risk tolerance.\n\n### Binary Risk\n\nVolatility products allow market participants to take a binary view on market risk and are a critical piece of market infrastructure. The [VIX](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp), an index representing the market’s estimate of future volatility, is a cornerstone of traditional financial markets. CeFi markets already offer some vol products ([FTX ](https://about.ftx.com/)[MOVE](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033136331-MOVE-contracts)), but DeFi markets have few equivalents. Protocols like [Volmex](https://volmex.finance/) are working to create a volatility index while [Benchmark Protocol](https://benchmarkprotocol.finance/)’s stablecoin uses the VIX as an input to its stability mechanism. [INDEX Coop](https://www.indexcoop.com/) seems like a natural candidate for a DeFi native volatility index and [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/#/trade?options=eth) [has expressed interest](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9sS21RREc5Ug/episode/YjEzNDIzMGEtY2JkYi00OTQ2LTkzMDctZjM5NzlmODg2NTQ4?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjDiaX984rwAhUITawKHWA3B6AQjrkEegQIAxAL&ep=6) in creating a “DeFi VIX” as well.\n\n### Risk on a Sliding Scale\n\nEmerging DeFi protocols are developing “risk-matching engines” to pair market participants that prefer less risk with those that prefer more. Most are approaching this via multi-token systems that separate speculative versus non-speculative aspects of a protocol and redistribute cash flows accordingly ([Saffron](https://saffron.finance/), [BarnBridge](https://barnbridge.com/), [Element](https://element.fi/)). For example, [Element](https://element.fi/) splits principal and yield, allowing users to purchase the NPV of the principal (basically a zero-coupon bond) or take up to 10x leveraged exposure to the yield.⁸ [BarnBridge](https://barnbridge.com/) splits cash flows into fixed yield and variable yield. Variable yield holders get upside above a fixed rate but subsidize the fixed yield token holders in the case of a shortfall. Similarly, [Saffron](https://saffron.finance/) splits risk into senior and junior tranches. Senior tranches except lower yields in exchange for coverage from junior tranches in the event that things go south. More yield = more risk.\n\nThese programmable risk protocols enable peer-to-peer risk transfer and allow users to bet on different parts of the capital structure. Risk-averse capital (like corporate treasuries) may prefer to buy the senior tranche, while [Degens](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/degen) chasing yield may prefer junior tranches. Greater expressivity of risk tolerance is a positive development for DeFi markets and there is nothing inherently dangerous about tranching.\n\n> ***Risk tranches have become toxic in the past, namely when they’ve tried to circumvent the risk/reward ratio. The [CDO²](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo2.asp) will forever be my favorite example of clever financial engineering, packaged to look like a riskless instrument when it was actually full of risk.***\n\n## Financial Primitive 4: Arbitrage\n\n*There is one important exception to the risk/reward ratio and that is [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp). Arbitrage creates (theoretically) riskless profit opportunities and it plays a critical role in price discovery, **which** is one of the things smart contract platforms are best suited for.⁴ The [Kimchi premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kimchi-premium.asp) is a perfect example. Buy an asset for $55,000 in the U.S. and sell the same asset for $65,000 in South Korea. Riskless profit.*\n\nArbitrage is required for many DeFi protocols to function properly and needs to be considered in the design of any protocol. [Uniswap ](https://uniswap.org/)is heavily reliant on arbitrageurs to maintain price discovery. Arbitrageurs rebalance portfolios on [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/). Some [argu](https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484)e that [MakerDAO’s ](https://makerdao.com/en/)scale is limited due to the infeasibility of arbitraging [CDP](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateralized-debt-position-cdp)s. Miners on [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co/) are incentivized to mine on the chain by arbitraging the BTC-STX rate.⁶ [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/)’s [StableCredit](https://docs.yearn.finance/r-and-d/stablecredit) relies on arbitrage rather than governance to maintain stability in the system. [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ParaSwap](https://paraswap.io/#/), and [Rari](https://rari.capital/) can all be used as vehicles for arbitrage. [ThorChain](https://thorchain.org/) and [Serum](https://dex.projectserum.com/#/market/AtNnsY1AyRERWJ8xCskfz38YdvruWVJQUVXgScC1iPb) will be crucial to enabling cross-chain arbitrage as DeFi protocols launch across Layer 1s. As DeFi struggles to scale, avoidance of gas costs will present a temporary arbitrage opportunity, which is increasingly shaping v2/v3 design ([Aave](https://aave.com/) v2 [collateral swaps](https://medium.com/aave/the-aave-protocol-v2-f06f299cee04), [dydx](https://dydx.exchange/)’s gasless order book, [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) v2s pooled assets, [Sushiswap](https://sushi.com/)’s [BentoBox](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/introducing-kashi-lending-margin-trading-on-sushiswaps-bentobox-eb91286f6910)).\n\n> ***v1s focused on cross-protocol arbitrage, v2s/v3s are focusing on chain-cross arbitrage***\n\nArbitrage increases [market efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp) (the degree to which market prices reflect all available, relevant information) but it also results in narrower spreads and normalized yields, eliminating temporary advantages between protocols. As market efficiency increases, so does competition. True protocol innovation, and not just incrementalism, will be required to maintain dominance in this environment.\n\n\n---\n\nv2 and v3 DeFi protocols will need to innovate across all four financial primitives, as their interconnected nature is what drives markets. Without arbitrage, stablecoins can’t scale. Without liquidity, there is no ability to arbitrage. Leverage lets you take more risk, and risk transfer can let you take on more leverage. Importantly, DeFi enables entirely new financial primitives, such as flash loans, that have no traditional counterpart. Protocols that solve for all of these primitives, and/or that create novel ones, will lead the way for the next generation of DeFi. I can’t wait to see v4 and v5.\n\n\n---\n\nCompare to my earlier thoughts on [DeFi: What it Is and Isn’t](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16) and get in [touch](https://twitter.com/j_humenansky)!\n\nThank you to [Alex Pruden](https://medium.com/u/e1ca31caefb9?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------), [Eddy Lazzarin](https://medium.com/u/2051feec12f2?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------), [Dmitriy Berenzon](https://medium.com/u/a25f7c81672d?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------) and [Luca Cosentino](https://medium.com/u/effdd16050cd?source=post_page-----1be5caec3f26--------------------------------) for feedback.\n\n### References\n\n 1.

{"id": "irfJxzod7cbrYGfdIkAJvQzHz6QKhWorH-kgerDFwZE", "title": "DeFi: What it Is and Isn’t", "body": "*\\*Originally [published](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16) on Jun 6, 2019*\n\nI interviewed industry professionals at top law firms, investment funds, exchanges, and various [decentralized finance](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) projects, in addition to attending panels and conducting independent research at UC Berkeley, to better understand the the emerging DeFi industry.\n\nThe article that follows will outline the differences between the [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) dream and the [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) reality, and highlights 7 of the most pertinent challenges the industry must overcome before bridging the gap. Subsequent articles will analyze the decentralized exchange of assets and decentralized lending and derivatives. These articles assume a foundational knowledge of both financial markets and [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) technology.\n\nThe most widely used application of blockchain technology is in the creation of digital currencies, which has required the development of financial markets to support their exchange. However, these financial markets, in their current state, prevent fair and open access. Furthermore, the infrastructure that supports blockchain-based markets is vulnerable to counterparty risk, censorship, a lack of transparency, and manipulation as it remains largely centralized. Current infrastructure flaws erode trust and inhibit adoption.\n\nJust as the internet allowed for the creation of a new information infrastructure, [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) technology allows for the creation of a new financial infrastructure and the development of entirely new markets. The [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) movement has emerged in an attempt to make the infrastructure that supports new and existing blockchain-based markets just as decentralized as the underlying technology.\n\n\n---\n\n## The DeFi Dream\n\nIn a functioning decentralized financial system, internet connection would be the only prerequisite to accessing financial services, rather than geography or circumstance. A reduction in the centralization of those that control and own the infrastructure underpinning financial markets would increase transparency, decrease costs, and reduce the opportunity for censorship and / or manipulation. The global “unbanked” (both individuals and enterprises) would gain access to financial services. [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) would not only facilitate markets for illiquid financial products that already exist but would also allow for the creation of new financial products and markets that don’t yet exist. The ability to more effectively arbitrage, borrow, hedge, and access liquidity would spur more institutions to join the movement without restricting the usage of these products and markets exclusively to them.\n\n## The DeFi Reality\n\nWhile [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/dapps) is referred to as “open finance” and is sometimes touted as a way to “bank the unbanked,” the truth of the matter is these products aren’t aimed at the mass retail investor, let alone the global “unbanked.” Technology is not usually the primary factor restricting access to financial services. More often than not, [identity ](https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/the-impact-of-digital-identity-9eed5b0c3016)and/or oppressive regimes are. On the retail side, it is unreasonable to believe that the average retail investor would understand the risk profile of even the simplest DeFi products and I’ve yet to hear a compelling argument for why the average retail investor would need access to exotic financial derivatives. UX/UI challenges present further obstacles to retail adoption.\n\nProduct-market fit for most institutional investors is not any clearer. Most DeFi projects aren’t well suited for HFT (high-frequency trading) since they’re limited in terms of speed. They are not well suited to trading large positions either and traditional finance institutions won’t even consider entering into transactions in which their counterparty is unknown. At this point, institutional traders aren’t willing to make these trade-offs so long as they can trust at least one other person in the markets in which they operate.\n\nAs a result, product-market fit is currently constrained to crypto-native power users that are comfortable with the existing UX/UI challenges of crypto networks and blockchain-based assets. For user adoption to accelerate, the trade-offs required by [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) interfaces must not outweigh the perceived benefit of ownership, access, and transparency when compared with centralized alternatives. A lack of developer education and tools is also restraining the industry. Tooling and services need to be further developed and a best-in-class stack needs to be established so that users don’t have to interact with a fragmented ecosystem marching in fragmented directions. Developers, regulators, lawyers, investors, professional traders, and retail users will have to work together to overcome existing challenges.\n\n> As a result, the transition towards a decentralized financial system is more likely to be evolutionary than revolutionary. That doesn’t diminish the potential of DeFi to reshape the way in which markets function and the way that the entire world interacts and transacts.\n\nWhile the DeFi movement has the potential to provide meaningful benefits over centralized alternatives, there are many practical challenges the DeFi industry needs to overcome first. **User adoption may be the biggest impediment to the development of the industry at present, new risks compounded across protocols may be the biggest threat to its sustainability.** An in-depth look at the 7 most pertinent challenges follows.\n\n### 1.) Identity and Reputation\n\nThe first step in entering into a financial transaction often requires the identification of transacting parties. However, a core tenant of [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) is that one’s ability to access financial services should not be dependent on most aspects of identity. This is problematic as violations of [KYC ](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2016/02/07/fincen-know-your-customer-requirements/)/ [AML ](https://www.finra.org/industry/anti-money-laundering)/ [OFAC ](https://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/olm_037.htm)regulations can not only result in large fines but could result in criminal charges. If a [DeFi](https://blog.coincodecap.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-defi-decentralized-finance) Relayer (an entity that hosts on order book on a DeFi protocol) facilitates an exchange between unknown parties and those parties turn out to violate any of these regulations, the consequences may be serious. Furthermore, without a way to enforce identity, most proposals for decentralized governance of these projects are quickly reduced to plutocracy.\n\nWhile still far from complete solutions, projects are researching ways to allow for KYC (know your customer procedures) without introducing centralization. For example, Relayers on [0x](https://0x.org/why) can opt-in to implement a [permissioned liquidity pool ](https://blog.0xproject.com/compliant-peer-to-peer-trading-4dab8e5c3162)that ensures that pool is only accessible to whitelisted [Ethereum](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/ethereum/) addresses that meet certain requirements, such as those required by AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC policies. However, this method still doesn’t ensure identity in a way that allows one to know that a counterparty is trustworthy without excluding those outside of the traditional financial system and introducing centralization. Several parties have issued EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) to incorporate KYC/AML compliance into ERC-20 tokens. However, in many cases, these proposals would still require service providers to work together off-chain via a consortium to review each others’ KYC policies and it is still unclear whether these proposals would fully satisfy regulatory requirements.\n\nEstablishing reputation in [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) networks is a distinct challenge. This is a strong industry focus as the range of possible products expands when there is a sense of on-chain reputation. There are currently two main ways to attempt to establish reputation in these networks:\n\n* Allowing everyone to start on an equal playing field under the assumption that network participants are good actors. Participants that prove to be untrustworthy / uncreditworthy would subsequently be slashed (punished.) Underwriters on the Dharma network fall into this category, wherein they gradually build reputation over time via an on-chain record of their accuracy and behavior.\n* Porting existing credit data to a [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/what-is-blockchain-a-simple-guide-for-dummies) network via an oracle. This is hardly an improvement over the traditional finance system in terms of allowing for fair access.\n\nThe lack of an on-chain reputation method that doesn’t require users to reveal too much about their personal identity means most DeFi projects require (over)collateralization in lieu of being able to establish trustworthiness.\n\n### 2.) Capital Inefficiency\n\nThe overcollateralization required by DeFi projects is capital inefficient. [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/da/) requires users to deposit 1.5x the value of ETH to establish the collateralized debt position underpinning Dai (CDPs will be covered in more depth in *Risk Off or On?: Decentralized Lending and Derivatives*.) Even still, most people choose to keep their “loan-to-value” ratio at 300 percent in order to avoid double digit liquidation penalties.¹ Similarly, Compound requires a 2x collateralization ratio, which the company says will decrease over time.² However, some users indicated a willingness to post 4x–5x the required collateral.²\n\n> ***Until a decentralized reputation system is developed, there is little choice but to require users to lock up excess capital, dulling the benefit of taking out these positions to begin with. Even when/if reputation is solved, the volatility of the underlying positions could result in a persistent preference to overcollateralize.***\n\n### 3.) Oracles\n\nCorruption of on-chain oracles (the mechanism that finds and submits real-world data to a smart contract) is a huge concern for these systems since liquidation occurs automatically in the event that collateral levels drop below their specified “loan-to-value” ratios. Different DeFi projects approach oracles in different ways, but many projects in the space are using MakerDAO’s oracle. MakerDAO’s oracle is currently designed to support single collateral Dai (backed entirely by ETH) but will be re-designed to support multi-collateral Dai (backed by a pool of different cryptocurrencies) in the near future. MakerDAO’s oracle pulls data from sixteen different sources for its oracle feed. These sources are comprised of [Ethereum](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/ethereum/) addresses voted on by MKR token holders, which are then submitted to an autonomous smart contract. The oracle chooses the median of all sixteen submitted data points. This system allows for 51% tolerance as it excludes the outliers which are more likely to be submitted by malicious actors.¹ Importantly, MakerDAO also utilizes an oracle security module in which the second layer of the protocol can activate an emergency shut down. This shut down freezes the system at its last known “safe state” if it has reason to believe the oracle may have been compromised. If an emergency shutdown occurs, users can convert their Dai to ETH at the equivalent of 1$/1 Dai, according to the state of the ledger at its last determined “safe state.¹”\n\nSingle collateral Dai oracles update every time the price of ETH fluctuates by +/-1.0% but multi-collateral Dai (MCD) oracles will update once an hour.¹ This allows the sixteen oracle inputs to be viewable for an hour before they are acted upon, increasing transparency. However, such a long lag time may not be appropriate considering the volatility of cryptoassets. The company’s argument that this delay can be compensated for by the risk model is questionable. Furthermore, liquidation of collateralized positions (essentially defaults) will be executed via auction with MCD, which means it will “six hours or more” to liquidate positions as the protocol accesses “all the arbitrageurs and liquidity across the whole marketplace and ecosystem.¹” The impact of having to wait 6 hours to unwind a single position during times of market distress, or failure, would be significant.\n\n[Compound ](https://compound.finance/)takes a different approach with its oracle, aggregating and averaging price feeds from a series of exchanges and posting them on-chain consistently. The data updates every time the underlying value fluctuates by +/- 0.1%, but data is updated on-chain every 15–30 seconds, confined by the processing speed of Ethereum.² Given the importance of oracles in these systems, DeFi projects may want to more closely consider which method they use or choose to implement their own methods.\n\n### 4.) Network: Platform, Liquidity, Scale\n\nMost current DeFi solutions are built on top of Ethereum and therefore DeFi’s adoption is tied to the scalability and usability of the Ethereum network. The scalability debate is well known (and addressed below) while usability remains a challenge as mainstream users still struggle to easily interact with [Web 3.0](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/web-3-0/).\n\n> ***While the composability of protocols built on Ethereum creates even larger switching costs, it also introduces network risk. As more projects build on Ethereum, it may become harder to upgrade the base layer protocol in a way that allows for backwards compatibility.***\n\nPart of the power of DeFi is that it allows for the creation of new markets. However, decentralized markets suffer the same circular problem that all new markets do: adoption is required to generate liquidity, but liquidity is a driver of adoption. While DeFi can enable new markets and allow new participants to access them, it does not automatically create liquid markets for these products. This is a problem because assets that are illiquid tend to trade at a discount to their liquid counterparts.³ It also creates inefficient pricing as opportunities for arbitrage go uncaptured since it remains difficult to move quickly and seamlessly between crypto markets.\n\nAlex Evans of Placeholder VC [breaks down ](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/4/9/defi-liquidity-models)the models of current DeFi networks into three broad categories:\n\n* Those that require users to find peers to trade with. *[Augur](https://www.augur.net/), [0x](https://0x.org/why), [Dharm](https://www.dharma.io/)a*\n* Those that pool “maker” assets and offer them to “takers” for a fee. *[Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/)*\n* Those that set parameters through governance, allowing users to trade directly with a smart contract. Ex: *[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/da/)*\n\nEach model has implications for liquidity. The lack of requirement to find a specific peer with which to trade seems to be the design advantage of the top protocols. These protocols also tend to offer fewer options in terms of products / use cases, which pools demand, facilitating better liquidity. Alex Evans also believes automatic and consistent processes (MakerDAO) better facilitate liquidity than bespoke and varied ones (Augur.) This seems to have been one of the drivers behind [UMA ](https://umaproject.org/)and Dharma deciding to set tighter parameters on their products (relative to a completely open system in which individual users set all parameters.)\n\n> ***“At least initially, the markets that have built deep pooled liquidity in a handful of important markets appear to have the adoption lead versus those that have tried to create a multi-asset infrastructure.” — Alex Evans***\n\nAssuming these markets find a way to bootstrap the necessary liquidity, [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/blockchain/) infrastructure is not yet scalable enough to process volumes similar to those processed by centralized exchanges. For a sense of the limited scale of current DeFi networks, investor at [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/), Arjun Balaji, [predicts ](https://medium.com/@arjunblj/crypto-theses-for-2019-dd20cb7f9895)that December 2019’s aggregate volume on 0x will lag a single day’s volume on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). While advances are being made in Layer 2 scalability and innovative solutions such as [StarkDEX ](https://blog.0xproject.com/starkdex-bringing-starks-to-ethereum-6a03fffc0eb7)(currently partnering with 0x) show promise, current [blockchain](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/blockchain/) infrastructure has a long way to go before it can support volumes similar to those supported in traditional markets.\n\n*\\*\\*Front-running, and other opportunities for manipulation, on DeFi networks will be addressed in Trade-Offs: Decentralized Exchange.\\*\\**\n\n### 5.) Business Models Still Undefined\n\nWhile there are many options, most DeFi projects have left their monetization method “undefined” and are focused on “defining the incentives of the protocol at large.⁴” However, at some point these projects will need to generate revenue if they are to persist.\n\n[dYdX ](https://dydx.exchange/')[highlights](http://unchained.forbes.libsynpro.com/how-dydx-allows-you-to-take-a-short-position-in-one-token-ep86) three main monetization models for DeFi projects:\n\n* Value accrual via a native token. *MakerDAO (MKR)*\n* Monetization via fees. P*otentially Compound*\n* Monetization via a user facing application. *dYdX, Dharma, etc.*\n\nIn most cases, a native token monetization model introduces another layer of friction to user adoption. For other projects it might not make sense. For example, a token monetization model doesn’t make much sense in networks where ownership / voting percentage can be determined by participation, which is recorded on-chain.² Nadav Hollander of Dharma points out that a fee model implemented at the protocol level, in addition to being somewhat anathema to blockchain ideology, could easily be forked away.⁴ However, Compound is not against keeping a small amount of the interest flowing through the system in a model akin to the AUM model in traditional finance.²\n\nThe latter appears to be the prevailing model. Dharma, dYdX, and others found that they needed to build out full stack products ([Expo ](https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/introducing-expo-ffe74a328f85)on dYdX, for example) because they found that developers weren’t willing to invest the time necessary to build on these new protocols. While the 0x model is often touted as the exemplary model, 0x’s success was enabled, in part, because there was already an existing market for DEXs (decentralized exchanges.) 0x’s protocol opened into an existing market, whereas these new DeFi protocols have to create new markets from scratch.\n\n> ***In an effort to bypass many of the challenges of creating a two-sided marketplace from scratch, it’s likely that new DeFi protocols will continue to build out full stack services and monetize those, at least over the near term.***\n\nIt is important to remember that creating a marketplace is a service business and that is unlikely to change. Whatever entity enables a marketplace also has to offer services to both the demand and supply sides. Marketplaces can’t be created out of thin air, even by the smartest protocols. They will always require a team / company to support the ecosystem with the services that allow marketplaces to live and grow.\n\n> ***As a result, designing businesses with “minimal viable decentralization” may be a more efficient way of launching of products and approaching early governance⁶ although its likely to be viewed less favorably by those that prioritize decentralization above all else.***\n\nDeFi business models are not constrained to the above mentioned models. For example, [Arwen ](https://www.arwen.io/)is planning to monetize via a revenue sharing agreement with centralized exchanges for the trades referred by Arwen⁵ (further details will be provided in *Trade-Offs: Decentralized Exchange*.)\n\n### 6.) New Risks Compounding Across Protocols\n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain-based markets have fundamentally different characteristics than their traditional counterparts. DeFi protocols benefit from composibility which leads to faster innovation, but also results in higher levels of interdependancy. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that the risk profile of these products, especially in combination, is not yet fully understood. While each project claims to have developed its own robust risk models, the complexity of analyzing these new risks across interdependent protocols is non-trivial. It’s also worth noting that most risk models weren’t very useful in 2008. In some cases, these models failed because just one assumption was flawed.\n\nMany of these projects utilize concepts that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, but more importantly, they utilize them in new and untested ways. For example, the rehypothecation of collateral, fractional ownership of structured products, and pooling of risk were all elements of the 2008 financial crisis. DeFi takes these concepts and applies them to highly volatile and hard to value assets in relatively illiquid markets with insufficient safeguards. The combination of all of these factors, combined with the complexity of creating a cohesive view of collateral rehypothecated across protocols, creates an entirely new risk profile for which there is little precedent. [Superfluid collateral](https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-to-earn-money-on-collateral-in-defi-and-why-thats-risky/)? Let’s not do this.\n\nIn this context, it’s worth considering what a market failure would look like. MakerDAO is an experimental network upon which the success of many other projects depends. It is important to remember that in the case of market failure, CDPs and other DeFi products are not insured and a third-party is not likely to step in to recapitalize small cap crypto start-ups (moral hazard debate aside.) Investors, users, and token holders will be responsible for recapitalizing this highly interdependent DeFi system.\n\nThe systemic impact would likely be jarring. Dai is commonly traded on 0x Relayers as a pair with ETH. It is often deposited on Compound and then lent out again to hedge funds to be used for risk-on trades. dYdX is also dependent upon MakerDAO since its short ETH token is long Dai. dYdX further depends on Dharma (which lends in Dai) and the 0x protocol (which facilitates the trading of Dai) to access liquidity. The cascading effect of a failure of any one of these protocols would likely cause a systemic unwind that is rapid (due to volatility of underlying, rehypothecation, and automated execution of smart contracts), jarring (these markets are not as liquid as traditional markets), and significant. The rewards may be high, but the risk is at least commensurate.\n\n> Cryptoeconomics don’t defy the principals of regular economics and cryptofinance (DeFi) can’t escape the classic risk/reward constraint of regular finance.\n\n### 7.) Regulation\n\nThe primary concern regarding regulation of the industry doesn’t seem to be that current regulations are too restrictive, but rather the concern is related to the ambiguity as to how existing regulations will be applied in regards to blockchain-based networks and cryptocurrencies. Many of the startups in the space don’t know how to determine whether they should launch or not because the regulatory environment they are operating in is so unclear. The cost of all this uncertainty is high.\n\n> ***In fact, the regulatory burden is so high that some start- ups have determined that they don’t have enough capital to launch in a fully compliant manner, made all the more difficult by the recent crypto winter fundraising environment.***\n\n\n---\n\n## From Dream to Reality\n\nProjects in the space are acutely aware of the above cited problems and are actively working to overcome them. For example, Dharma now pays gas fees for users to make the user experience easier while MakerDAO is planning to abstract the process of converting Dai to MKR upon redemption for MCD. Networks across the board are increasingly removing the requirement to hold native tokens, choosing to replace them with more widely used cryptocurrencies such as Dai or ETH. This is an important step since it removes what has historically been a hurdle to DeFi adoption.\n\nNew innovations and projects also enter the space frequently and could provide solutions to many of the weaknesses of current projects. For example, the Arwen protocol is ideally suited to HFT since only the opening and closing of escrow gets posted on-chain, while the rest of the protocol operates like a Layer 2 channel, allowing trading to happen much more quickly.⁵ The trade is also only visible to the trading party and the exchange. Since there is no on-chain execution of individual trades, miners do not see the transactions ahead of time, eliminating most of the front running issues that DEXs face.⁵ The protocol could also solve other critical painpoints, such as allowing for fractionally collateralized options (which dYdX is actively working towards), trustless fiat conversion (via integration with banks) and quicker movement of tokens across exchanges, allowing for effective arbitrage.⁵\n\nIn 2017–2018, the main focus in the DeFi industry was on building DEX scalability and liquidity. Solutions for each are quickly evolving. The focus in 2018–2019 has shifted to lending. The composability of DeFi products should allow the whole ecosystem to move forward at a faster pace and may allow for more mainstream adoption throughout 2019, as users are lured into the ecosystem via multiple protocols (trading, lending, derivatives) that all require users to transact with cryptocurrency.\n\nMany of these dynamics could spur more usage and adoption in the next eighteen months, creating the flywheel effect common in two-sided markets. The key point is to acknowledge that while the challenges are persistent and numerous, the industry is far from stagnant, and real and rapid progress is being made. However, risks need to be seriously assessed and considered so that this progress can be sustained.\n\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n*All interviews personally conducted are unattributed*\n\n1. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/rune-christensen-of-makerdao-part-1-how-to-keep-a-crypto-collateralized-stablecoin-afloat/>\n2. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-youll-earn-interest-on-your-crypto-with-compound-ep-82/>\n3. <http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/country/illiquidity.pdf>).\n4. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/nadav-hollander-on-how-dharma-could-create-new-forms-of-debt-ep-80/>\n5. <https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-to-trade-on-crypto-exchanges-without-fear-of-hacks/>\n6.

{"id": "9aUTxUv3I6dMUpJ7dPL4xNptkDUNhWK2P1H7-g6uPY8", "title": "learning by daoing: designing for the unique properties of daos", "body": "at the most basic level, daos are simple. they facilitate two things: collective ownership and collective decision making. it starts to get more complicated when we consider the many ways to design daos. when it comes to designing daos, we spend too much time talking about how each dao is different and not enough time thinking about the ways in which they are the same. this lack of design framework either forces us to resort to traditional companies as a baseline model (porting over many of the limitations of traditional organizations) or to forgo any framework at all and struggle to manage a dao’s evolution.\n\n[https://twitter.com/benschecter/status/1499588950599610372](https://twitter.com/benschecter/status/1499588950599610372)\n\nthrough the (currently painful) process of daoing, i’ve identified several inherent properties common across functional daos. by designing daos with these common properties in mind, we can not only improve the experience of daoing but also design systems that accomplish more than traditional corporations ever have (one example [here](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)).\n\nthese properties are: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, Transparency\n\n\n---\n\n## Autonomy\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to make your own decisions without being controlled by anyone else; the right of an organization, country, or region to be independent and govern itself ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/autonomy)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** in contrast to traditional corporations, daos cannot be controlled or *[captured](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)*\n* **design principle:** *design for the highest degree of autonomy (weakly linked, autonomous sub-daos) while providing checks and balances on distributed power*\n\nthe biggest difference between corporations and daos is that daos can be capture-resistant, meaning they incorporate mechanisms to prevent the capture of shared resources by bad actors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). in traditional corporate structures, capture resistance is weakly ensured via trust and reputation, since both matter in the repeated game of public business. internal capture is prevented via regulations enforced by higher-level, external agencies. daos require different assurances against capture since trust, reputation, and regulation are mostly absent in large, somewhat anonymous, digitally native networks. daos can be designed to be capture-resistant, but most aren’t. there are three main ways a dao can be captured:\n\n### 1.) control over decision making\n\nthe 2020 wave of daos pioneered “[progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/),” or turning control over to a community once a protocol built by a centralized core team achieved product-market-fit. this approach prevents the core team from being distracted by building a community and a product at the same time, and avoids design by committee, which isn’t usually conducive to shipping products. this method **builds community around collective ownership**, launching a token once operations are “sufficiently decentralized” and suddenly turning decision making over to a group of new token holders, usually via token-weighted governance. all decision making has been centralized up to this point and a large portion of product-related decisions often remain centralized. since decision making has been centralized from the start, decentralizing it can feel like giving up control, which core teams are often reluctant to do.\n\ncommunity members are drawn in by a token launch, not by co-building or participating in the network over time, which can create communities that are more speculative in nature. given a lack of other criteria, like previous contributions to the dao, tokens are generally distributed based on retroactive usage, which has proven to be a weak contributor acquisition method. contributors quickly become frustrated by a low degree of involvement in decision making. these dynamics can result in lower voter participation, making any decentralized decision making less capture-resistant as less voices are represented.\n\nregardless of the path towards decentralization, token-weighted governance increases the possibility of capture in the decision making process, the risks of which are well outlined [here](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html). Optimism’s two house governance system is a positive first step towards more capture-resistant governance (more [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/).)\n\n> **for daos to be capture-resistant, we must decouple power (decision making rights) from wealth (token holdings)**\n\n### 2.) control over resources\n\nto avoid some of these challenges, we experimented with a different decentralization method at [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/). our hope was to **build a community around collective decision making**, by inviting contributors to co-create with us much earlier in the decentralization process (pre-token) rather than building a community around collective ownership of an already finished product and token. We involved our community gradually in non-core business operations, spinning up a series of community-led working groups. however, since there was no mechanism for *decentralized* decision making, working groups were still reliant on external stakeholders for access to critical resources (in this case a centralized company, without a governance mechanism). as a result, our working groups were vulnerable to capture and we made the decision to pause this experiment until we could empower working groups with more autonomy.\n\neven when decentralized decision making does exist, the party controlling the resources (ie. parent dao) still has lower context as to the value a working group provides. while working groups may be equipped with their own budgets, they are still subject to a budget allocation process that is outside their control. even with a token to align incentives between a parent dao and a working group, the value a working group adds may not be reflected in the token value of the parent (ie. metagovernance, the value of which is hard to tie back to a core business value.)\n\n> **when one group controls access to resources for another, the relationship becomes adversarial**\n\nwhile working groups help to control and separate scope within a monolithic organization, the higher autonomy design choice is to replace them with multiple sub-daos. autonomous sub-daos allow communities to organize around specific goals with complete autonomy over how to achieve them, to maintain direct ownership over their own resources, and to share directly in any upside generated from their efforts.\n\nthese sub-daos can focus on building either the supply side (to increase the scale/scope of product offerings) or the demand side (to explore new use cases or aggregate users). they may also take the form of a subsidiary, providing services across the ecosystem (ie. metagovernance.) all sub-daos should have economically sustainable business models, so they are not dependent on external parties for resources, but a native token quickly becomes an important means of creating “[weak strategic alignment](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)” between daos via token swaps (more on this method [here](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1505977366991974402); see [MetricsDAO](https://twitter.com/MetricsDAO) and [Goblin Sax](https://twitter.com/goblinsax)).\n\n### 3.) control over execution\n\nthe greatest opportunity for capture occurs at the execution phase. governance generally works as follows (see more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)):\n\n* a proposal is put forward\n* the community votes on a proposal\n* the outcome of the proposal is either autonomously executed on-chain or an off-chain action is executed by a select party\n* execution is verified and / or analyzed by the community\n\nexecution is the phase most vulnerable to capture since nothing prevents those with execution power (ie. multi-sig signers) from ignoring the will of voters and executing whatever actions they choose. this doesn’t mean we should eliminate all positions of trust within daos. there is a common misconception that in order to avoid capture, decentralized organizations must be flat. but daos are leaderful, not leaderless. daos can still have hierarchy, it’s just that it’s fluid.\n\npositions of trust (like those with execution power) should be elected or legitimized by the broader community with clear mechanisms for removal if/when the responsibilities of those positions are abused or neglected. [Yearn’s gov 2.0](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460) proposes such a model, wherein highly autonomous yTeams are empowered by YFI holders to act independently in the best interest of yearn, within a constrained domain of action and discrete decision-making powers, subject to monitoring by YFI holders which have the power to remove contributors if roles are abused (more [here](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460)).\n\n> **being a leader in a dao is the most humbling thing I’ve ever done because you cannot rely on static positional authority. you must constantly earn respect with the community. on the good days, it’s meritocracy; on the bad days, trial by jury.**\n\npositions of trust don’t need to be open to the entire dao. while power should be distributed, it shouldn’t be permissionless. unauthorized participation can actually threaten a DAO’s resistance to capture as it creates more attack vectors (more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)). while participation by as many community members as possible should be encouraged as an *input* into decision making, the ability to put forward certain proposals, make decisions, and hold positions of trust should be subject to qualifying criteria.\n\n> **daos (the human layer) do not need to be as decentralized as the protocols they are built around (the tech layer)**\n\n## **Emergence**\n\n* **what it means:** *the fact of something becoming known or starting to exist ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/emergence)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in corporations, ideas are dictated from the top down. in daos, initiatives surface organically from the community*\n* **design principle:** *emergent daos don’t have to be amorphous. a strong mission and culture can guide collective decision making without being overly prescriptive*\n\nemergence is vital to maintaining an active community. daos that don’t support emergence become little more than shell communities over time as contributors get frustrated having little ability to influence the dao. the most emergent daos are “day-one daos,” which form organically when groups of people rally around a mission, idea, belief, or event. they’re decentralized from the beginning and decide what to do or build collectively. these daos usually launch tokens immediately as a way to raise funding, which also immediately decentralizes decision making. this provides contributors with full autonomy to shape the dao emergently but day-one daos can struggle to guide decision making given the lack of structure.\n\nlet’s define culture as a set of shared beliefs about how decisions should be made (mission) and which behaviors will be rewarded (values). culture is mostly an afterthought in traditional corporations. decision makers are determined via hierarchy and decisions are implemented by force, so there is little need to define a framework around how decisions get made. In contrast, culture is a critical tool for guiding decisions made by a collective.\n\nwhy are mission statements so important for daos? because they provide a north star for decision making and set a general direction for the dao. directionless daos tend to lose momentum, and i’ve never seen a dao that lost momentum get it back. a strong mission can also create a moat. people think community is a moat but it can’t be since community members are constantly changing. your mission, however, can consistently draw in value-aligned contributors and keep them there when the dream of the dao inevitably fades into the reality of the dao ([twoirtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896203439091729)).\n\ncontributors can only meaningfully contribute to 3–4 daos, so they need a compelling reason to contribute to one over another. RabbitHole contributors have said they work with us specifically because they understand our mission and share our beliefs. this is important because it creates a sense of belonging, which is among the top things contributors crave.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440)\n\nclear values are the second component of building a strong dao culture. more emergent daos tend to develop around icons, “mimetic filters,” lore, or specific events, which serve as a natural filter to draw in value-aligned contributors. they must then work together to collectively define their mission and values (see [Yearn Blue Pill](https://medium.com/iearn/the-blue-pill-ca44ed01f16f)). the best values make clear which behaviors will be rewarded and which actions should be prioritized over others within the dao (see [example](https://twitter.com/flynnjamm/status/1479485964225503233?s=21)).\n\nmission statements and values can be suggested by a core team (see [CCS](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/16G0rsr1ZzpbnHWNcNSNkY8YEz03jq6nn_5TA1hCmDqQ/mobilebasic), Mirror [1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Um_0l4WkIwEoBMxSCjIxv8xfPe_tJCn6I8eDFHNNIg/edit#slide=id.g102289b1e02_1_403), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1olJhdPN0iP1gxY7DDQfiMr-XwdRIbA-rzID5jqPGuU0/edit), and [3](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17ZCRNLbPSVVBbpUISuTW5uWIu9VJBynE), and [ENS)](https://twitter.com/AlexSlobodnik/status/1470545402554458112) or collectively created by contributors (see [OADAO](https://otherinter.net/research/pooltogether-offchain-report/)). regardless of the process for defining them, establishing a clear mission and values provides emergent daos with just enough guidance about how to make decisions without being overly prescriptive.\n\n## Complexity\n\n* **what it means:** *a complex system emerges organically as a result of the behaviors of the components within it, rather than according to a predetermined plan ([Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/impact/defining-complex-system/)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *most corporations are complicated systems, with any complexity tightly controlled by bureaucracy. daos are complex systems, meaning it’s hard to determine the impact actions in advance (more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3555&v=6mwVOp_7TFQ&feature=emb_logo)*)\n* **design principle:** *communities should co-create seasonal charters to guide efforts in a way that accounts for uncertainty while preventing chaos*\n\nsince well designed daos empower contributors to make decisions that can meaningfully change the trajectory of the organization, outcomes are hard to anticipate. that doesn’t mean that daos have to be chaotic. just because we don’t know the exact destination, doesn’t mean we can’t steer at all.\n\nstrategy can exist in daos, the difference relative to corporate strategy is that dao strategy is co-created by contributors rather than set from the top-down. the simplest way to do this is via collectively authored charters (see [here](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Metagovernance-Pod-v0-Charter-FINAL-b289ebc63e44456bae1a17987f1a57b8)) that serve as a mutable guide outlining high-level goals, suggested processes, and guiding principles to inform decision making over a season. these charters maximize contributor scope within a “container,” providing a collectively agreed upon roadmap that defines *what* needs to be accomplished while allowing contributors to determine *how* they arrive at the intended destination. allowing for re-evaluation and updates to charters at regular intervals is important since much of how a dao operates is discovered through day-to-day experience ([twoirrtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896222971879437))\n\n> **while dao visions are collectively discovered over time, dao strategy should be collectively set at regular intervals**\n\nwhile contributors want the ability to shape strategy, i’ve found that they also don’t want to be handed a completely blank slate. at RabbitHole, we found the optimal balance in providing an initial charter outlining \\~70% of what a working group will drive towards and empowering the community to provide feedback and fill in the rest.\n\n## Agency\n\n*autonomy is present at the organizational/dao level while agency is present at the individual contributor level*\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to take action or to choose what action to take ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/agency)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in traditional corporations, top level management holds most of the agency. in daos, all network participants maximize agency*\n* **design principle:** *daos need to be designed with the understanding that individual contributors will optimize for agency via voice and exit*\n\n### 1.) Voice (change the system from within)\n\ngovernance gives contributors *the option* to have a voice in decision making. while most governance conversations focus on how to increase voter participation, *having the option* to vote is actually more important than constantly voting. if contributors have the option to effectuate change, but don’t choose it, they have nobody to blame. if they do exercise the option, they feel empowered by the agency to influence their own destiny. since the option is more important than the action, the expectation should *not* be that every tokenholder votes on every vote. most everyday users don’t want to participate in democracy for the products they use each day. even if they wanted to, it’s a full time job to keep up with all proposals and so quorum is usually only met on the most controversial proposals. once we accept that option to vote is more important than the action of voting, we can stop applying a one-size-fits-all decision making model to governance. this will allow us to make more effective decisions, which is one of the two primary purposes of daos (along with collective ownership.)\n\n[https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1488584926903607300](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1488584926903607300)\n\nwhat effective decision making comes down to is empowering high context people to make localized decisions while granting everyone else the option to protest when/if needed. if we design for agency, we can start experimenting more with consent-based governance (see [Mirror 0004](https://dao.mirror.xyz/U91KFBfSmWCjJar4-tflQBSQK1H0IVTOMheSPrHvU0Q)), optimistic governance (see [Aragon](https://aragon.org/aragon-govern) and [Tribe](https://twitter.com/joey__santoro/status/1513555100618264577?s=21&t=KuJC02BF-hTlhp5iqEuJ0g)), and lazy consensus (see [Colony](https://colony.io/)) and we can start to think about differing voting rights based on identity, reputation, and contribution (See [Element](https://medium.com/element-finance/voting-vaults-a-new-defi-and-governance-primitive-b4b2f6289d48?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------)).\n\n![Dan Wu: https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1499859953594642439?cxt=HHwWjsC9rcyrydApAAAA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MNcv3BD01WNjqoSl)\n\n### 2.) Exit (leave to create start a new system or join a competitor)\n\npart of the beauty of daos is the fluidity of participation and the ability to work, on a part-time basis, for multiple daos at once. it also means that exit is an easier option for contributors than it is at a traditional corporation. core teams should be prepared to fill in any gaps created by a primarily part-time contributor base that may frequently choose exit. maintaining continuity of work when turnover is high increases the need for thorough and transparent process documentation and clearly outlined strategies. you probably don’t want to evaluate your dao on retention. instead, focus on ratifying co-created policies and processes that allow any contributor to plug into well defined, yet flexible, and well documented workflows, reducing dependency on any one contributor without adding top-down bureaucracy.\n\n## Transparency\n\n* **what it means:** *the quality of being done in an open way without secrets ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/transparency))*\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** daos redefine the meaning of “radical transparency” in a way that would severely rattle private corporations\n* **design principle:** *design for nearly complete transparency and higher levels of accountability relative to traditional organizations*\n\nwhile public corporations make some data transparent, they do so in a highly edited format, released at infrequent intervals. in contrast, all the raw data pertaining to on-chain actions of a dao is publicly viewable, in its entirety, in real time. contributors expect a similar level of transparency for all off-chain data and decision making. providing this level of transparency into off-chain actions is where many daos fall short and run into conflict.\n\nthe purpose of transparency in corporations and daos is also different. the purpose of corporate transparency is *to inform* shareholders about decisions that have already been made. the purpose of dao transparency is *to enable* contributors to make decisions. this makes transparency all the more important in daos as information asymmetry actually prevents contributors from fulfilling their role ([chase chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman)). however, this level of transparency also means that dao operators will be held accountable 24/7. contributors will expect rapid responses and open communication at all times. at the same time, anonymity among the contributor base provides less transparency and lowers accountability. since the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise, it will get rough in the Discord. dao operators need mental health benefits and support. burnout is extremely common among community managers, but it’s also preventable. while complete transparency seems like the simplest property to design for, it has the most underestimated impact on dao operators.\n\n\n---\n\nit’s completely mindblowing what a group of internet strangers can do when empowered by collective ownership and decision making. we can accomplish even more if we start designing daos in a way that embraces their unique properties: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, and Transparency. If these properties will be disruptive to what you’re trying to achieve, a dao might not be the best structure to accomplish your goal.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lalalavendr/status/1499760045692796929](https://twitter.com/lalalavendr/status/1499760045692796929)\n\n*\\*this doesn’t mean that daos can’t build products, they can and have, it just means that daos may be far more effective at organizing other types of activities, considering their inherent properties*\n\nwe’re still figuring out what great dao design looks like and we have a long way to go. daos are constantly evolving, so the best approach today may not be the best approach tomorrow. i still believe these design principles are useful, even if we disagree about them, because they start a conversation that hopefully moves us all forward, together, and isn’t that the whole point anyway?\n\n\n---\n\nIf you liked my thoughts on daos, check out my earlier thoughts on [DeFi](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16), [DeFi 2.0](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26), and [Web3 Social](https://justine.mirror.xyz/dQtmHWtUcUsb_-rUtOgc8fzCn5z6lw1cLoMcswykV3I)\n\nThanks to [pet3rpan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) for discussions on this topic and for feedback from: [Diana Chen](https://twitter.com/ddwchen), [Chase Chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Meg Lister](https://twitter.com/MegLister), [Ben Schecter](https://twitter.com/benschecter), and [Vishal Kankani](https://twitter.com/kankanivishal)", "timestamp": 1657243647, "digest": "ITRTe2OKz4BALnDe9vMhzGfrSCS16G-nu6mOaIoNx_o", "contributor": "0x30Cf218b751f0204d906962798d6d6251AE67eF4"}

Optimism’s two house governance system is a positive first step towards more capture-resistant governance (more [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/).)\n\n> **for daos to be capture-resistant, we must decouple power (decision making rights) from wealth (token holdings)**\n\n### 2.) control over resources\n\nto avoid some of these challenges, we experimented with a different decentralization method at [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/). our hope was to **build a community around collective decision making**, by inviting contributors to co-create with us much earlier in the decentralization process (pre-token) rather than building a community around collective ownership of an already finished product and token. We involved our community gradually in non-core business operations, spinning up a series of community-led working groups. however, since there was no mechanism for *decentralized* decision making, working groups were still reliant on external stakeholders for access to critical resources (in this case a centralized company, without a governance mechanism). as a result, our working groups were vulnerable to capture and we made the decision to pause this experiment until we could empower working groups with more autonomy.\n\neven when decentralized decision making does exist, the party controlling the resources (ie. parent dao) still has lower context as to the value a working group provides. while working groups may be equipped with their own budgets, they are still subject to a budget allocation process that is outside their control. even with a token to align incentives between a parent dao and a working group, the value a working group adds may not be reflected in the token value of the parent (ie. metagovernance, the value of which is hard to tie back to a core business value.)\n\n> **when one group controls access to resources for another, the relationship becomes adversarial**\n\nwhile working groups help to control and separate scope within a monolithic organization, the higher autonomy design choice is to replace them with multiple sub-daos. autonomous sub-daos allow communities to organize around specific goals with complete autonomy over how to achieve them, to maintain direct ownership over their own resources, and to share directly in any upside generated from their efforts.\n\nthese sub-daos can focus on building either the supply side (to increase the scale/scope of product offerings) or the demand side (to explore new use cases or aggregate users). they may also take the form of a subsidiary, providing services across the ecosystem (ie. metagovernance.) all sub-daos should have economically sustainable business models, so they are not dependent on external parties for resources, but a native token quickly becomes an important means of creating “[weak strategic alignment](https://mirror.xyz/olly.eth/SptJwnUcMMKtvjoD7J-xYCWZZNTBkaksahJ1CH3aWr4)” between daos via token swaps (more on this method [here](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1505977366991974402); see [MetricsDAO](https://twitter.com/MetricsDAO) and [Goblin Sax](https://twitter.com/goblinsax)).\n\n### 3.) control over execution\n\nthe greatest opportunity for capture occurs at the execution phase. governance generally works as follows (see more [here](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)):\n\n* a proposal is put forward\n* the community votes on a proposal\n* the outcome of the proposal is either autonomously executed on-chain or an off-chain action is executed by a select party\n* execution is verified and / or analyzed by the community\n\nexecution is the phase most vulnerable to capture since nothing prevents those with execution power (ie. multi-sig signers) from ignoring the will of voters and executing whatever actions they choose. this doesn’t mean we should eliminate all positions of trust within daos. there is a common misconception that in order to avoid capture, decentralized organizations must be flat. but daos are leaderful, not leaderless. daos can still have hierarchy, it’s just that it’s fluid.\n\npositions of trust (like those with execution power) should be elected or legitimized by the broader community with clear mechanisms for removal if/when the responsibilities of those positions are abused or neglected.

crave.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\n![](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1499773066448146440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499773066448146440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fflynnjamm%2Fstatus%2F1499773066448146440image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\nclear values are the second component of building a strong dao culture. more emergent daos tend to develop around icons, “mimetic filters,” lore, or specific events, which serve as a natural filter to draw in value-aligned contributors. they must then work together to collectively define their mission and values (see [Yearn Blue Pill](https://medium.com/iearn/the-blue-pill-ca44ed01f16f)). the best values make clear which behaviors will be rewarded and which actions should be prioritized over others within the dao (see [example](https://twitter.com/flynnjamm/status/1479485964225503233?s=21)).\n\nmission statements and values can be suggested by a core team (see [CCS](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/16G0rsr1ZzpbnHWNcNSNkY8YEz03jq6nn_5TA1hCmDqQ/mobilebasic), Mirror [1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Um_0l4WkIwEoBMxSCjIxv8xfPe_tJCn6I8eDFHNNIg/edit#slide=id.g102289b1e02_1_403), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1olJhdPN0iP1gxY7DDQfiMr-XwdRIbA-rzID5jqPGuU0/edit), and [3](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17ZCRNLbPSVVBbpUISuTW5uWIu9VJBynE), and [ENS)](https://twitter.com/AlexSlobodnik/status/1470545402554458112) or collectively created by contributors (see [OADAO](https://otherinter.net/research/pooltogether-offchain-report/)). regardless of the process for defining them, establishing a clear mission and values provides emergent daos with just enough guidance about how to make decisions without being overly prescriptive.\n\n## **Complexity**\n\n* **what it means:** *a complex system emerges organically as a result of the behaviors of the components within it, rather than according to a predetermined plan ([Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/impact/defining-complex-system/)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *most corporations are complicated systems, with any complexity tightly controlled by bureaucracy. daos are complex systems, meaning it’s hard to determine the impact actions in advance (more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3555&v=6mwVOp_7TFQ&feature=emb_logo)*)\n* **design principle:** *communities should co-create seasonal charters to guide efforts in a way that accounts for uncertainty while preventing chaos*\n\nsince well designed daos empower contributors to make decisions that can meaningfully change the trajectory of the organization, outcomes are hard to anticipate. that doesn’t mean that daos have to be chaotic. just because we don’t know the exact destination, doesn’t mean we can’t steer at all.\n\nstrategy can exist in daos, the difference relative to corporate strategy is that dao strategy is co-created by contributors rather than set from the top-down. the simplest way to do this is via collectively authored charters (see [here](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Metagovernance-Pod-v0-Charter-FINAL-b289ebc63e44456bae1a17987f1a57b8)) that serve as a mutable guide outlining high-level goals, suggested processes, and guiding principles to inform decision making over a season. these charters maximize contributor scope within a “container,” providing a collectively agreed upon roadmap that defines *what* needs to be accomplished while allowing contributors to determine *how* they arrive at the intended destination. allowing for re-evaluation and updates to charters at regular intervals is important since much of how a dao operates is discovered through day-to-day experience ([twoirrtter.eth](https://twitter.com/twoirtter/status/1495896222971879437))\n\n> **while dao visions are collectively discovered over time, dao strategy should be collectively set at regular intervals**\n\nwhile contributors want the ability to shape strategy, i’ve found that they also don’t want to be handed a completely blank slate. at RabbitHole, we found the optimal balance in providing an initial charter outlining \\~70% of what a working group will drive towards and empowering the community to provide feedback and fill in the rest.\n\n## **Agency**\n\n*autonomy is present at the organizational/dao level while agency is present at the individual contributor level*\n\n* **what it means:** *the ability to take action or to choose what action to take ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/agency)*)\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** *in traditional corporations, top level management holds most of the agency. in daos, all network participants maximize agency*\n* **design principle:** *daos need to be designed with the understanding that individual contributors will optimize for agency via voice and exit*\n\n### 1.) Voice (change the system from within)\n\ngovernance gives contributors *the option* to have a voice in decision making. while most governance conversations focus on how to increase voter participation, *having the option* to vote is actually more important than constantly voting. if contributors have the option to effectuate change, but don’t choose it, they have nobody to blame. if they do exercise the option, they feel empowered by the agency to influence their own destiny. since the option is more important than the action, the expectation should *not* be that every tokenholder votes on every vote. most everyday users don’t want to participate in democracy for the products they use each day. even if they wanted to, it’s a full time job to keep up with all proposals and so quorum is usually only met on the most controversial proposals. once we accept that option to vote is more important than the action of voting, we can stop applying a one-size-fits-all decision making model to governance. this will allow us to make more effective decisions, which is one of the two primary purposes of daos (along with collective ownership.)\n\n![](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1488584926903607300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1488584926903607300%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fchaserchapman%2Fstatus%2F1488584926903607300image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\nwhat effective decision making comes down to is empowering high context people to make localized decisions while granting everyone else the option to protest when/if needed. if we design for agency, we can start experimenting more with consent-based governance (see [Mirror 0004](https://dao.mirror.xyz/U91KFBfSmWCjJar4-tflQBSQK1H0IVTOMheSPrHvU0Q)), optimistic governance (see [Aragon](https://aragon.org/aragon-govern) and [Tribe](https://twitter.com/joey__santoro/status/1513555100618264577?s=21&t=KuJC02BF-hTlhp5iqEuJ0g)), and lazy consensus (see [Colony](https://colony.io/)) and we can start to think about differing voting rights based on identity, reputation, and contribution (See [Element](https://medium.com/element-finance/voting-vaults-a-new-defi-and-governance-primitive-b4b2f6289d48?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------)).\n\n![Dan Wu: https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1499859953594642439?cxt=HHwWjsC9rcyrydApAAAA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MNcv3BD01WNjqoSl)\n\n### 2.) Exit (leave to create start a new system or join a competitor)\n\npart of the beauty of daos is the fluidity of participation and the ability to work, on a part-time basis, for multiple daos at once. it also means that exit is an easier option for contributors than it is at a traditional corporation. core teams should be prepared to fill in any gaps created by a primarily part-time contributor base that may frequently choose exit. maintaining continuity of work when turnover is high increases the need for thorough and transparent process documentation and clearly outlined strategies. you probably don’t want to evaluate your dao on retention. instead, focus on ratifying co-created policies and processes that allow any contributor to plug into well defined, yet flexible, and well documented workflows, reducing dependency on any one contributor without adding top-down bureaucracy.\n\n## **Transparency**\n\n* **what it means:** *the quality of being done in an open way without secrets ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/transparency))*\n* **what it means in the context of daos:** daos redefine the meaning of “radical transparency” in a way that would severely rattle private corporations\n* **design principle:** *design for nearly complete transparency and higher levels of accountability relative to traditional organizations*\n\nwhile public corporations make some data transparent, they do so in a highly edited format, released at infrequent intervals. in contrast, all the raw data pertaining to on-chain actions of a dao is publicly viewable, in its entirety, in real time. contributors expect a similar level of transparency for all off-chain data and decision making. providing this level of transparency into off-chain actions is where many daos fall short and run into conflict.\n\nthe purpose of transparency in corporations and daos is also different. the purpose of corporate transparency is *to inform* shareholders about decisions that have already been made. the purpose of dao transparency is *to enable* contributors to make decisions. this makes transparency all the more important in daos as information asymmetry actually prevents contributors from fulfilling their role ([chase chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman)). however, this level of transparency also means that dao operators will be held accountable 24/7. contributors will expect rapid responses and open communication at all times. at the same time, anonymity among the contributor base provides less transparency and lowers accountability. since the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise, it will get rough in the Discord. dao operators need mental health benefits and support. burnout is extremely common among community managers, but it’s also preventable. while complete transparency seems like the simplest property to design for, it has the most underestimated impact on dao operators.\n\n\n---\n\nit’s completely mindblowing what a group of internet strangers can do when empowered by collective ownership and decision making. we can accomplish even more if we start designing daos in a way that embraces their unique properties: Autonomy, Emergence, Complexity, Agency, and Transparency. If these properties will be disruptive to what you’re trying to achieve, a dao might not be the best structure to accomplish your goal.\n\n![this ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/07hzyQ9M06VL24xNYakkc.png?height=307&width=921)\n\nwe’re still figuring out what great dao design looks like and we have a long way to go. daos are constantly evolving, so the best approach today may not be the best approach tomorrow. i still believe these design principles are useful, even if we disagree about them, because they start a conversation that hopefully moves us all forward, together, and isn’t that the whole point anyway?\n\n\n---\n\nIf you liked my thoughts on daos, check out my earlier thoughts on [DeFi](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-what-it-is-and-isnt-part-1-f7d7e7afee16), [DeFi 2.0](https://medium.com/zeroknowledge/the-evolution-of-defi-across-four-financial-primitives-1be5caec3f26), and [Web3 Social](https://justine.mirror.xyz/dQtmHWtUcUsb_-rUtOgc8fzCn5z6lw1cLoMcswykV3I)\n\nThanks to [pet3rpan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) for discussions on this topic and for feedback from: [Diana Chen](https://twitter.com/ddwchen), [Chase Chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Meg Lister](https://twitter.com/MegLister), [Ben Schecter](https://twitter.com/benschecter), and [Vishal Kankani](https://twitter.com/kankanivishal)", "timestamp": 1657243524, "digest": "ITRTe2OKz4BALnDe9vMhzGfrSCS16G-nu6mOaIoNx_o", "contributor": "0x30Cf218b751f0204d906962798d6d6251AE67eF4"}

I analyzed the web2 platforms as an equity research analyst at Barclays, and immediately recognized the potential of web3 to fix much of what I thought was broken in web2 social networks.\n\nEarly conversations about blockchain-based social networks were mostly focused on what could be accomplished by leveraging a different data structure, centering the conversation on “data ownership,” privacy, and digital identity. The switching argument was values-based and not compelling enough for most to deal with any degree of friction on decentralized networks.\n\nNow, as social networks begin to blend with DeFi, the switching argument is about economic incentives, rather than moral imperatives, and the novel functionality they offer: publicly trade and display cultural symbols; invest with and in your friends; earn your way into exclusive social circles; connect directly with your favorite creators; prove ownership of digital assets. Eventually, activity on these networks will create an open social graph that is used to offer better DeFi rates and/or lower collateralization ratios. These new social networks combine social and financial capital, making them approachable to the mainstream in a way that DeFi wasn’t. Everyone understands social capital.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1427681957291376643](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1427681957291376643)\n\nArguing about whether DeFi is more important than NFTs or whether NFTs, DAOs, or Social Tokens will reign as the dominant social networks of web3 misses the point. Their interconnectedness is what makes web3 so powerful. NFTs create an impetus for people to quickly spin up DAOs, which then serve as NFT market makers. NFTs will act as keys to DAOs, governed according to social token ownership. The metaverse is comprised of the combination of these things, which, in turn, only increase the importance of being able to prove digital ownership. DeFi makes these networks possible and all the activity on these networks will be used to amplify DeFi. Save the tribalism for Punks vs. Apes.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ianIDEO/status/1429156970645233670](https://twitter.com/ianIDEO/status/1429156970645233670)\n\n## Web3 is Not a Protest, it’s Closer to a Cultural Movement\n\nTo understand what’s happening with web3, we need to quickly revisit the shortcomings of web2 social networks. In short, web2 platforms own your online identity and social graph and hold all the power, the business model is extractive to the user and the incentives create a terrible user experience (low signal engagement, disinformation, high ad load, etc.) Web2 social networks suffered as they scaled, weakly connecting people within an increasingly less exclusive network. Web2 lost any sense of belonging.\n\nSocial networks combined with elements of DeFi flip many of the web2 incentives but they’ll still be subject to the worst of human nature (after all social networks are built on human interactions.) They’ll still revolve around status and image, but should be much higher signal as web3 is built around ownership rather than indication. Web3 still requires you to be part of a club/clique to participate, but it clearly specifies the process and cost of joining. Web3’s immutable ledger creates accountability where web2 has none, and on-chain interaction encourages less noise and higher quality engagement. It’s still signaling, but it’s more costly and, therefore, more credible.\n\nWe originally thought web3 would be built on trust, but turns out it’s actually built on scarcity. The downside is that scarcity networks create FOMO by design, are exclusive by definition, and encourage impulsive behavior as being late carries the risk of being shut out entirely. The benefit is that scarcity will also allow web3 social networks to more effectively scale. The ability to easily spin up DAOs in web3 means that the number of communities can scale rather than the size of the network. Since these communities reward early adopters, gradually converting social capital into financial capital, they offer compounding benefits as they grow.³ An open social graph describing all of this activity would be more powerful than anything that could be built on web2.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1429890905163517958](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1429890905163517958)\n\nWeb3 social networks should also be better at continuously reinventing themselves,² since they determine their own outcomes, in contrast to web2 platforms which lost relevance with many of their users years ago. Web3 participants are (literally) invested in the communities they join, which should help maintain quality over time. The best creators and contributors will migrate to web3, rather than stay on on rent-seeking web2 platforms. Web2 platforms and corporate brands will continue to try, but they cannot reverse engineer these dynamics. This revolution has to occur at the protocol layer.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ianIDEO/status/1403753637633875968](https://twitter.com/ianIDEO/status/1403753637633875968)\n\nWe originally thought web3 would be a protest against web2 monopolies but it looks more like a cultural movement. While culture may be the hook that draws new people into the ecosystem, most of the activity currently occurring on these networks is only partially about culture, at best.\n\n> ***If the mantra of web2 was “come for the tool, stay for the network”, the mantra of web3 is probably closer to “come for the culture, stay for the returns.” And the returns are why most people are involved right now.***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8dcef255-12b3-4a05-b0e3-345ddf4d2082.jpg?height=475&width=1165)\n\nEach social component of web3 represents a slightly different value system, but they’re all built on the same principle: scarcity.\n\n## NFTs: The Content Layer - Not Just a Status Symbol\n\n*Web2 analog: NFTs combine elements of Instagram (influence and image) and LinkedIn (status and prestige.) Depending who you ask, owning a Punk is either like owning a Ferrari or [having gone to Harvard](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1423657661162311686).*\n\n![https://twitter.com/HarryBTC/status/1416435920061018119](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dad8812a-f4b3-42b9-a757-718b56262ec8.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nMost people attribute the recent NFT mania to two things 1.) NFTs as a store of value 2.) NFTs as a status symbol. I think it’s true that the market is at least partially driven by people looking for non-$ denominated stores of value in an inflationary environment. Afterall, [Visa bought a cryptopunk before they bought bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/visa-buys-cryptopunk-nft-for-150000.html). But NFTs are also about status (sorry if you thought this was about art). Wealthy people have always used expensive items to signal status, whether it be fine art, yachts, private jets, or handbags.¹ NFTs just make ownership of those items verifiable and public.\n\n> ***It’s not really socially acceptable to have a profile picture (PFP) of your Lambo, but you’re encouraged to display your Punk. MTV Cribs existed to solve this exact problem— how do I flex my otherwise hidden wealth? NFTs.***\n\nPublic display of these status symbols actually drives more demand for them, playing to our natural [mimetic desires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory). A public ledger also creates bragging rights in that we now have proof that someone got in early, spotted that trend before everyone else, is a die hard fan. Immutable proof that you’re cool. How much would you pay for that?\n\nBut there is something more going on with NFTs. It’s not just about status anymore than they’re just a store of value. People held Punks long before they were a flex, and if you ask anyone trading NFTs, they’ll tell you that selling them is the worst part. Maybe that’s because when you sell your NFT, you also lose your tribe. An NFT bonds you with your fellow Apes and communicates to everyone that you belong to a certain group. The public ledger also ties you to a lineage of everyone who has ever owned that NFT. This not only adds [a whole new dimension of value to digital art](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1431731996607275010), it elevates you into a new social standing and even ensures your legacy in a way (you’re now an unforgettable part of history.)\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus/status/1429193578664837121](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus/status/1429193578664837121)\n\n### No Real-time Feedback Loop\n\nA huge tenet of web2 platforms is that they support real-time feedback loops (Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) NFTs do not right now. NFT markets are illiquid and price discovery is still inefficient. In other words, NFTs aren’t good at conveying real-time information yet, meaning status is mostly inferred. We know it’s worth something, but we don’t really know what.\n\nThis won’t last for long. Almost every CeFi exchange is building an NFT marketplace and there are many startups working on the “financialization of NFTs.” However, these inefficiencies are part of what enables outsized financial returns. While DeFi maximalists love to hate NFTs, the NFT market feels pretty degen.\n\n## Social Tokens: The Social Graph - Exclusivity\n\n*Web2 analog: Social Tokens are similar to TikTok, in that they allow anyone to go viral. They also represent the web2 shift away from crowded networks to private messaging groups, discord servers, etc.*\n\n*NFTs have utility beyond collection. One of the things they can be used for is as keys that unlock access to creators and communities.*\n\n![Ihttps://future.a16z.com/creator-before-community/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e8d95ead-e8cd-492c-a139-7e74762f7066.jpg?height=464&width=885)\n\nSocial tokens are digital assets backed by the reputation of a brand, individual or community.3 They can be fungible or non-fungible. Supply can be fixed or determined by a bonding curve (so that price increases along with distribution of the token.) They fall into two categories: personal tokens (fan clubs) and community tokens (social circles.) Both give holders exclusive access to a person or community. Personal tokens can be launched more quickly versus community tokens, which require coordinating a group towards a shared vision. However, community tokens may benefit from broader distribution, which has proven important in web2. As of Dec 2020, the total marketcap of all social tokens was $81M, now the marketcap of $FWB (one of the most prominent community tokens) alone is $180M.\n\nAll of these tokens rely on the belief that a creator or community will become more valuable tomorrow than it is today. Some represent Income Sharing Agreements (ISA), but others grant access to a newsletter, a private chat, or even a voting system that lets people[ dictate a creator’s daily habits](https://www.coindesk.com/man-who-sells-himself-now-wants-buyers-to-control-his-life) ($ALEX). The artist[ Connie Digital](https://twitter.com/conniedigital?lang=en) rewarded $HUE holders with a shout-out on a virtual billboard. The rapper Lil Yachty issued surprise boxes and virtual parties exclusively to $YACHTY holders. $WHALE issued a social token, backed by top NFTs, that holders can use as a payment method on OpenSea.7 Grammy-award winning musician RAC and NBA point guard Spencer Dinwiddie have also introduced tokens to give fans a stake in their success.⁶ Community tokens often grant access to an exclusive newsletter, discord server, and token-gated IRL events.\n\n### A Different Type of Walled Garden?\n\nScarcity is a double edged sword for social tokens as it means as membership grows, entry becomes inaccessible to most ($FWB membership is now priced at +$14,000). These communities will need to experiment with tiered models, in which entry level membership is lower cost and higher levels of membership can be earned through more active participation. Most token communities are introducing the concept of seasons and performance-based systems to avoid free-rider problems anyway.\n\n> ***While scarcity improves scalability, if it comes at the expense of accessibility, we’ll just end up with a different type of walled garden.***\n\nOne way to reduce this tendency could be to build these communities on a combination of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. An NFT could serve as the key to a community (and even different cohorts, tiers, or functions within that community) and then social tokens could be used to determine ownership and influence (via governance stake) within that community.\n\nSocial tokens have many potential benefits but they also run the greatest risk of amplifying the more toxic dynamics of web2. These risks will be magnified with social tokens that are purely speculative (don’t grant any access or non-financial rewards to holders.) Creators or influencers should have full autonomy over their tokens, or at least be required to opt-in. After all, social tokens invite the public to openly speculate on a person or group’s worth. I can’t think of a scenario in which being able to short a personal social token wouldn’t be problematic. Social tokens quantify popularity and create an in-group. Membership should probably be earned rather than bought.\n\n## Social DAOs: The Aggregation Layer - Social Circles\n\n*Web2 analog: DAOs, literally and figuratively, are a Discord. DAOs also enable Wall Street Bets (partybids) to actually win against Wall Street sharks (whales) and turn web3 into a MMORPG.*\n\n*Amidst this explosion of NFTs and social tokens, DAOs will play the role of aggregator. Aggregators accrued most of the value in web2 and, in web3, DAOs will aggregate by collecting, curating, and moderating.*\n\n![https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4e0459c1-39ab-432b-87ca-db12d1c9ed5f.jpg?height=596&width=1071)\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations are internet-native collectives that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals.5 DAOs aren’t new (remember The DAO circa 2016?) but they’ve seen a recent resurgence. In 2019, DeepDAO only recorded 10 DAOs. That number is now 133. This increase was driven by a variety of factors including the launch of DeFi protocol governance tokens, some legal frameworks out of Wyoming and Delaware (series LLCs), and the rise of the NFT market, which created an impetus for the quick formation of DAOs to pool capital together in pursuit of an otherwise unobtainable NFT. Who knows, maybe DAOs become the social clubs of the metaverse.\n\nSocial DAOs are the most explicit mechanism by which to combine both social and financial capital. They create digital social circles and can also empower a collective of individuals to flip power dynamics against wealthy individuals. In NFT bidding wars, they can empower a group of individuals to overtake an individual whale (sometimes causing them to switch sides and join the DAO). They also enable co-creation and collective participation in a way that isn’t really possible on web2.\n\n> ***Yes, DAOs are more about community than scarcity. However, they are still scarcity networks as you either have to be asked to join or buy your way in (usually at an increasingly expensive price).***\n\n### We Have the Network, but Not the Tools\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5627c193-3d71-44a8-bcd0-4ad52d494af2.jpg?height=665&width=1151)\n\nDAOs are not really DAOs yet, meaning most are not actually decentralized, autonomous, or organized. In theory, DAOs reduce coordination costs. In practice, they might even increase them. Common pain points include: lack of regulatory clarity, keeping up with communications and proposals, treasury management, division of labor, allocating payments to members, (semi)-centralized operations, and community selection and engagement. This last point is becoming more important as DAOs mature and people realize the importance of carefully curating a committed community.\n\n## A Social Protocol: The Reputation Layer - Credibility\n\n*Web2 analog: Twitter + Facebook, but built on Ethereum. On-chain interactions (NFTs, social tokens, and DAOs) create an open social graph that can be leveraged by social protocols.*\n\nAll social networks start with identity, create a graph between identities, and then attempt to infer things from that graph (reputation, for example.) In web3, ENS + MetaMask replaces SSO as the de facto log-in, allowing web3 identity to integrate with applications beyond a given identity provider’s ecosystem. Eventually wallets will become more like profiles, with native NFT integration for profile pictures, Rabbithole integration for on-chain resumes, and mirror + NFT marketplaces for on-chain portfolios. Interactions between identities will be combined to create an open social graph. Of course, not all interactions will be on chain, but what settles on-chain will allow developers to:\n\n* Create friend-matching mechanisms based on NFT ownership, DAO membership, social token ownership, and protocol usage\n* Better curate communities\n* Establish community-based delegated credit based on proven membership in particular DAOs\n* Develop a[ web of trust](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3375436), the ultimate path towards decentralized reputation and un/undercollateralized lending which ties all of the activity on web3 social networks right back to DeFi again. Social tokens could be used as collateral to bootstrap reputation until we have a full web of trust\n\n  <https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1419773010425401353>\n\n### It’s Always about Identity\n\nThe non-persistence of online identity is probably the biggest obstacle to effectively utilizing this open social graph. As web2 evolved, users moved away from using their real identities. Finsta, anon, and alt accounts became the norm. On web3 people have public .eth addresses complemented by many other private addresses. Identity is important to social protocols, though, because it creates social accountability, which is totally missing in web2 and DeFi. Incentives (different levels of access or better DeFi rates) could be offered for higher levels of attestation, which could include Proof of Humanity, POAP, and Proof of Participation. Incorporating zero-knowledge proofs into these solutions could help balance verification and privacy. Personal social tokens could also be used as a sort of identity proxy, providing an alternative to hardcoding identity on-chain for those that value privacy more highly.\n\n![Based on https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1413631784135192576](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7da1ebba-59e7-4624-80c3-983a21f785d0.jpg?height=356&width=1026)\n\n## Web3 Will Not Fix Everything\n\nSocial exchange theory totally broke down on web2.[ Key concepts of social exchange theory](https://start-thinking.com/sm-and-comm-theories) include reciprocity, fairness and negotiated rules, with information, approval, respect, power, group gain and personal satisfaction among the rewards in successful transactions. Web3 restores critical elements of social exchange.\n\n> ***That said, technology doesn’t eliminate natural human instincts and, therefore, technology alone won’t prevent some of the toxic elements of web2 from creeping into web3.***\n\nWeb3 will still be about brand and status, cliques and clubs, and one-upping everyone else. Web3 is still addicting — just ask anyone on OpenSea at 4am. Nobody really knows the consequences of day-trading culture and scarcity networks that reward status and profit above all else. People who can’t afford to will lose millions trying to fit in.⁴ This system of in-groups will exacerbate the industry’s lack of diversity.\n\n> If web3 really is about culture, then we should ask ourselves how representative the culture we’re talking about is and if these networks are actually open or designed to reinforce [preferential attachment models](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment).\n\n[https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1430997412756262914](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1430997412756262914)\n\nThe biggest opportunity web3 has relative to web2, is that web3 doesn’t have to be zero-sum. It’s multi-player and participants literally have a vested interest in each other and the quality of the communities they build. The value generated by web3 should at least accrue to those creating art, contributing content, and building lasting communities rather than siloed monopolies. Participants will finally have a voice and a vote.\n\nIt feels like we are at a web3 inflection point, but we are nowhere near mainstream yet. NFT users are in the lower double digit millions relative to the roughly 4 billion users of web2 social networks. Web2 social networks have generated trillions in marketcap…. imagine what web3 can generate and then consider that it more effectively scales.\n\nPeter Thiel has[ a theory](https://sacks.substack.com/p/your-startup-is-a-movement?r=5eprj&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=twitter%20Looks%20rare.) that the best startups are like cults that believe something true. Web3 certainly feels like a cult and whether we believe it’s about culture, status, or scarcity, people believe that it is true.\n\nWeb3.

I analyzed the web2 platforms as an equity research analyst at Barclays, and immediately recognized the potential of web3 to fix much of what I thought was broken in web2 social networks.\n\nEarly conversations about blockchain-based social networks were mostly focused on what could be accomplished by leveraging a different data structure, centering the conversation on “data ownership,” privacy, and digital identity. The switching argument was values-based and not compelling enough for most to deal with any degree of friction on decentralized networks.\n\nNow, as social networks begin to blend with DeFi, the switching argument is about economic incentives, rather than moral imperatives, and the novel functionality they offer: publicly trade and display cultural symbols; invest with and in your friends; earn your way into exclusive social circles; connect directly with your favorite creators; prove ownership of digital assets. Eventually, activity on these networks will create an open social graph that is used to offer better DeFi rates and/or lower collateralization ratios. These new social networks combine social and financial capital, making them approachable to the mainstream in a way that DeFi wasn’t. Everyone understands social capital.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1427681957291376643](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1427681957291376643)\n\nArguing about whether DeFi is more important than NFTs or whether NFTs, DAOs, or Social Tokens will reign as the dominant social networks of web3 misses the point.

In short, web2 platforms own your online identity and social graph and hold all the power, the business model is extractive to the user and the incentives create a terrible user experience (low signal engagement, disinformation, high ad load, etc.) Web2 social networks suffered as they scaled, weakly connecting people within an increasingly less exclusive network.

They’ll still revolve around status and image, but should be much higher signal as web3 is built around ownership rather than indication. Web3 still requires you to be part of a club/clique to participate, but it clearly specifies the process and cost of joining.

The downside is that scarcity networks create FOMO by design, are exclusive by definition, and encourage impulsive behavior as being late carries the risk of being shut out entirely. The benefit is that scarcity will also allow web3 social networks to more effectively scale. The ability to easily spin up DAOs in web3 means that the number of communities can scale rather than the size of the network.

People held Punks long before they were a flex, and if you ask anyone trading NFTs, they’ll tell you that selling them is the worst part.

NFT markets are illiquid and price discovery is still inefficient. In other words, NFTs aren’t good at conveying real-time information yet, meaning status is mostly inferred. We know it’s worth something, but we don’t really know what.\n\nThis won’t last for long. Almost every CeFi exchange is building an NFT marketplace and there are many startups working on the “financialization of NFTs.” However, these inefficiencies are part of what enables outsized financial returns. While DeFi maximalists love to hate NFTs, the NFT market feels pretty degen.\n\n## Social Tokens: The Social Graph - Exclusivity\n\n*Web2 analog: Social Tokens are similar to TikTok, in that they allow anyone to go viral. They also represent the web2 shift away from crowded networks to private messaging groups, discord servers, etc.*\n\nNFTs have utility beyond collection. One of the things they can be used for is as keys that unlock access to creators and communities.\n\n![Ihttps://future.a16z.com/creator-before-community/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e8d95ead-e8cd-492c-a139-7e74762f7066.jpg?height=464&width=885)\n\nSocial tokens are digital assets backed by the reputation of a brand, individual or community.3  They can be fungible or non-fungible. Supply can be fixed or determined by a bonding curve (so that price increases along with distribution of the token.) They fall into two categories: personal tokens (fan clubs) and community tokens (social circles.) Both give holders exclusive access to a person or community. Personal tokens can be launched more quickly versus community tokens, which require coordinating a group towards a shared vision. However, community tokens may benefit from broader distribution, which has proven important in web2. As of Dec 2020, the total marketcap of all social tokens was $81M, now the marketcap of $FWB (one of the most prominent community tokens) alone is $180M.\n\nAll of these tokens rely on the belief that a creator or community will become more valuable tomorrow than it is today. Some represent Income Sharing Agreements (ISA), but others grant access to a newsletter, a private chat, or even a voting system that lets people[ dictate a creator’s daily habits](https://www.coindesk.com/man-who-sells-himself-now-wants-buyers-to-control-his-life) ($ALEX). The artist[ Connie Digital](https://twitter.com/conniedigital?lang=en) rewarded $HUE holders with a shout-out on a virtual billboard. The rapper Lil Yachty issued surprise boxes and virtual parties exclusively to $YACHTY holders. $WHALE issued a social token, backed by top NFTs, that holders can use as a payment method on OpenSea.7 Grammy-award winning musician RAC and NBA point guard Spencer Dinwiddie have also introduced tokens to give fans a stake in their success.⁶ Community tokens often grant access to an exclusive newsletter, discord server, and token-gated IRL events.\n\n### A Different Type of Walled Garden?\n\nScarcity is a double edged sword for social tokens as it means as membership grows, entry becomes inaccessible to most ($FWB membership is now priced at +$14,000). These communities will need to experiment with tiered models, in which entry level membership is lower cost and higher levels of membership can be earned through more active participation. Most token communities are introducing the concept of seasons and performance-based systems to avoid free-rider problems anyway.\n\n> ***While scarcity improves scalability, if it comes at the expense of accessibility, we’ll just end up with a different type of walled garden.***\n\nOne way to reduce this tendency could be to build these communities on a combination of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. An NFT could serve as the key to a community (and even different cohorts, tiers, or functions within that community) and then social tokens could be used to determine ownership and influence (via governance stake) within that community.\n\nSocial tokens have many potential benefits but they also run the greatest risk of amplifying the more toxic dynamics of web2. These risks will be magnified with social tokens that are purely speculative (don’t grant any access or non-financial rewards to holders.) Creators or influencers should have full autonomy over their tokens, or at least be required to opt-in. After all, social tokens invite the public to openly speculate on a person or group’s worth. I can’t think of a scenario in which being able to short a personal social token wouldn’t be problematic. Social tokens quantify popularity and create an in-group. Membership should be earned rather than bought.\n\n## Social DAOs: The Aggregation Layer - Social Circles\n\n*Web2 analog: DAOs, literally and figuratively, are a Discord. DAOs also enable Wall Street Bets (partybids) to actually win against Wall Street sharks (whales) and turn web3 into a MMORPG.*\n\nAmidst this explosion of NFTs and social tokens, DAOs will play the role of aggregator. Aggregators accrued most of the value in web2 and, in web3, DAOs will aggregate by collecting, curating, and moderating.\n\n![https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4e0459c1-39ab-432b-87ca-db12d1c9ed5f.jpg?height=596&width=1071)\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations are internet-native collectives that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals.5 DAOs aren’t new (remember The DAO circa 2016?) but they’ve seen a recent resurgence. In 2019, DeepDAO only recorded 10 DAOs. That number is now 133. This increase was driven by a variety of factors including the launch of DeFi protocol governance tokens, some legal frameworks out of Wyoming and Delaware (series LLCs), and the rise of the NFT market, which created an impetus for the quick formation of DAOs to pool capital together in pursuit of an otherwise unobtainable NFT. Maybe DAOs become the social clubs of the metaverse.\n\nSocial DAOs are the most explicit mechanism by which to combine both social and financial capital. They create digital social circles and can also empower a collective of individuals to flip power dynamics against wealthy individuals. In NFT bidding wars, they can empower a group of individuals to overtake an individual whale (sometimes causing them to switch sides and join the DAO). They also enable co-creation and collective participation in a way that isn’t really possible on web2.\n\n> ***Yes, DAOs are more about community than scarcity. However, they are still scarcity networks as you either have to be asked to join or buy your way in (usually at an increasingly expensive price).***\n\n### We Have the Network, but Not the Tools\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5627c193-3d71-44a8-bcd0-4ad52d494af2.jpg?height=665&width=1151)\n\nDAOs are not really DAOs yet, meaning most are not actually decentralized, autonomous, or organized. In theory, DAOs reduce coordination costs. In practice, they might even increase them. Common pain points include: lack of regulatory clarity, keeping up with communications and proposals, treasury management, division of labor, allocating payments to members, (semi)-centralized operations, and community selection and engagement. This last point is becoming more important as DAOs mature and people realize the importance of carefully curating a committed community.\n\n## A Social Protocol: The Reputation Layer - Credibility\n\n*Web2 analog: Twitter + Facebook, but built on Ethereum. On-chain interactions (NFTs, social tokens, and DAOs) create an open social graph that can be leveraged by social protocols.*\n\nAll social networks start with identity, create a graph between identities, and then attempt to infer things from that graph (reputation, for example.) In web3, ENS + MetaMask replaces SSO as the de facto log-in, allowing web3 identity to integrate with applications beyond a given identity provider’s ecosystem. Eventually wallets will become more like profiles, with native NFT integration for profile pictures, RabbitHole integration for on-chain resumes, and mirror + NFT marketplaces for on-chain portfolios. Interactions between identities will be combined to create an open social graph. Of course, not all interactions will be on chain, but what settles on-chain will allow developers to:\n\n* Create friend-matching mechanisms based on NFT ownership, DAO membership, social token ownership, and protocol usage\n* Better curate communities\n* Establish community-based delegated credit based on proven membership in particular DAOs\n* Develop a[ web of trust](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3375436), the ultimate path towards decentralized reputation and un/undercollateralized lending which ties all of the activity on web3 social networks right back to DeFi again. Social tokens could be used as collateral to bootstrap reputation until we have a full web of trust\n\n  <https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1419773010425401353>\n\n### It’s Always about Identity\n\nThe non-persistence of online identity is probably the biggest obstacle to effectively utilizing this open social graph. As web2 evolved, users moved away from using their real identities. Finsta, anon, and alt accounts became the norm. On web3 people have public .eth addresses complemented by many other private addresses. Identity is important to social protocols, though, because it creates social accountability, which is totally missing in web2 and DeFi. Incentives (different levels of access or better DeFi rates) could be offered for higher levels of attestation, which could include Proof of Humanity, POAP, and Proof of Participation. Incorporating zero-knowledge proofs into these solutions could help balance verification and privacy. Personal social tokens could also be used as a sort of identity proxy, providing an alternative to hardcoding identity on-chain for those that value privacy more highly.\n\n![Based on https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1413631784135192576](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7da1ebba-59e7-4624-80c3-983a21f785d0.jpg?height=356&width=1026)\n\n## Web3 Will Not Fix Everything\n\nSocial exchange theory totally broke down on web2.[ Key concepts of social exchange theory](https://start-thinking.com/sm-and-comm-theories) include reciprocity, fairness and negotiated rules, with information, approval, respect, power, group gain and personal satisfaction among the rewards in successful transactions. Web3 restores critical elements of social exchange.\n\n> ***That said, technology doesn’t eliminate natural human instincts and, therefore, technology alone won’t prevent some of the toxic elements of web2 from creeping into web3.***\n\nWeb3 will still be about brand and status, cliques and clubs, and one-upping everyone else. Web3 is still addicting — just ask anyone on OpenSea at 4am. Nobody really knows the consequences of day-trading culture and scarcity networks that reward status and profit above all else. People who can’t afford to will lose millions trying to fit in.⁴ This system of in-groups will exacerbate the industry’s lack of diversity.\n\n> If web3 really is about culture, then we should ask ourselves how representative the culture we’re talking about is and if these networks are actually open or designed to reinforce [preferential attachment models](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment).\n\n[https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1430997412756262914](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1430997412756262914)\n\nThe biggest opportunity web3 has relative to web2, is that web3 doesn’t have to be zero-sum. It’s multi-player and participants literally have a vested interest in each other and the quality of the communities they build. The value generated by web3 should at least accrue to those creating art, contributing content, and building lasting communities rather than siloed monopolies. Participants will finally have a voice and a vote.\n\nIt feels like we are at a web3 inflection point, but we are nowhere near mainstream yet. NFT users are in the lower double digit millions relative to the roughly 4 billion users of web2 social networks. Web2 social networks have generated trillions in marketcap…. imagine what web3 can generate and then consider that it more effectively scales.\n\nPeter Thiel has[ a theory](https://sacks.substack.com/p/your-startup-is-a-movement?r=5eprj&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=twitter%20Looks%20rare.) that the best startups are like cults that believe something true. Web3 certainly feels like a cult and whether it’s about culture, status, or scarcity, people believe that it is true.\n\nWeb3.

The switching argument was values-based and not compelling enough for most to deal with any degree of friction on decentralized networks.\n\nNow, as social networks begin to blend with DeFi, the switching argument is about economic incentives, rather than moral imperatives, and the novel functionality they offer: publicly trade and display cultural symbols; invest with and in your friends; earn your way into exclusive social circles; connect directly with your favorite creators; prove ownership of digital assets. Eventually, activity on these networks will create an open social graph that is used to offer better DeFi rates and/or lower collateralization ratios. These new social networks combine social and financial capital, making them approachable to the mainstream in a way that DeFi wasn’t. Everyone understands social capital.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1427681957291376643](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1427681957291376643)\n\nArguing about whether DeFi is more important than NFTs or whether NFTs, DAOs, or Social Tokens will reign as the dominant social networks of web3 misses the point.

One of the things they can be used for is as keys that unlock access to creators and communities.\n\n![Ihttps://future.a16z.com/creator-before-community/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e8d95ead-e8cd-492c-a139-7e74762f7066.jpg?height=464&width=885)\n\nSocial tokens are digital assets backed by the reputation of a brand, individual or community.3  They can be fungible or non-fungible. Supply can be fixed or determined by a bonding curve (so that price increases along with distribution of the token.) They fall into two categories: personal tokens (fan clubs) and community tokens (social circles.) Both give holders exclusive access to a person or community. Personal tokens can be launched more quickly versus community tokens, which require coordinating a group towards a shared vision. However, community tokens may benefit from broader distribution, which has proven important in web2. As of Dec 2020, the total marketcap of all social tokens was $81M, now the marketcap of $FWB (one of the most prominent community tokens) alone is $180M.\n\nAll of these tokens rely on the belief that a creator or community will become more valuable tomorrow than it is today. Some represent Income Sharing Agreements (ISA), but others grant access to a newsletter, a private chat, or even a voting system that lets people[ dictate a creator’s daily habits](https://www.coindesk.com/man-who-sells-himself-now-wants-buyers-to-control-his-life) ($ALEX). The artist[ Connie Digital](https://twitter.com/conniedigital?lang=en) rewarded $HUE holders with a shout-out on a virtual billboard. The rapper Lil Yachty issued surprise boxes and virtual parties exclusively to $YACHTY holders. $WHALE issued a social token, backed by top NFTs, that holders can use as a payment method on OpenSea.7 Grammy-award winning musician RAC and NBA point guard Spencer Dinwiddie have also introduced tokens to give fans a stake in their success.⁶ Community tokens often grant access to an exclusive newsletter, discord server, and token-gated IRL events.\n\n### A Different Type of Walled Garden?\n\nScarcity is a double edged sword for social tokens as it means as membership grows, entry becomes inaccessible to most ($FWB membership is now priced at +$14,000). These communities will need to experiment with tiered models, in which entry level membership is lower cost and higher levels of membership can be earned through more active participation. Most token communities are introducing the concept of seasons and performance-based systems to avoid free-rider problems anyway.\n\n> ***While scarcity improves scalability, if it comes at the expense of accessibility, we’ll just end up with a different type of walled garden.***\n\nOne way to reduce this tendency could be to build these communities on a combination of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. An NFT could serve as the key to a community (and even different cohorts, tiers, or functions within that community) and then social tokens could be used to determine ownership and influence (via governance stake) within that community.\n\nSocial tokens have many potential benefits but they also run the greatest risk of amplifying the more toxic dynamics of web2. These risks will be magnified with social tokens that are purely speculative (don’t grant any access or non-financial rewards to holders.) Creators or influencers should have full autonomy over their tokens, or at least be required to opt-in. After all, social tokens invite the public to openly speculate on a person or group’s worth. I can’t think of a scenario in which being able to short a personal social token wouldn’t be problematic. Social tokens quantify popularity and create an in-group. Membership should be earned rather than bought.\n\n## Social DAOs: The Aggregation Layer - Social Circles\n\n*Web2 analog: DAOs, literally and figuratively, are a Discord. DAOs also enable Wall Street Bets (partybids) to actually win against Wall Street sharks (whales) and turn web3 into a MMORPG.*\n\nAmidst this explosion of NFTs and social tokens, DAOs will play the role of aggregator. Aggregators accrued most of the value in web2 and, in web3, DAOs will aggregate by collecting, curating, and moderating.\n\n![https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4e0459c1-39ab-432b-87ca-db12d1c9ed5f.jpg?height=596&width=1071)\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations are internet-native collectives that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals.5 DAOs aren’t new (remember The DAO circa 2016?) but they’ve seen a recent resurgence. In 2019, DeepDAO only recorded 10 DAOs. That number is now 133. This increase was driven by a variety of factors including the launch of DeFi protocol governance tokens, some legal frameworks out of Wyoming and Delaware (series LLCs), and the rise of the NFT market, which created an impetus for the quick formation of DAOs to pool capital together in pursuit of an otherwise unobtainable NFT. Maybe DAOs become the social clubs of the metaverse.\n\nSocial DAOs are the most explicit mechanism by which to combine both social and financial capital. They create digital social circles and can also empower a collective of individuals to flip power dynamics against wealthy individuals. In NFT bidding wars, they can empower a group of individuals to overtake an individual whale (sometimes causing them to switch sides and join the DAO). They also enable co-creation and collective participation in a way that isn’t really possible on web2.\n\n> ***Yes, DAOs are more about community than scarcity. However, they are still scarcity networks as you either have to be asked to join or buy your way in (usually at an increasingly expensive price).***\n\n### We Have the Network, but Not the Tools\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5627c193-3d71-44a8-bcd0-4ad52d494af2.jpg?height=665&width=1151)\n\nDAOs are not really DAOs yet, meaning most are not actually decentralized, autonomous, or organized. In theory, DAOs reduce coordination costs. In practice, they might even increase them. Common pain points include: lack of regulatory clarity, keeping up with communications and proposals, treasury management, division of labor, allocating payments to members, (semi)-centralized operations, and community selection and engagement. This last point is becoming more important as DAOs mature and people realize the importance of carefully curating a committed community.\n\n## A Social Protocol: The Reputation Layer - Credibility\n\n*Web2 analog: Twitter + Facebook, but built on Ethereum. On-chain interactions (NFTs, social tokens, and DAOs) create an open social graph that can be leveraged by social protocols.*\n\nAll social networks start with identity, create a graph between identities, and then attempt to infer things from that graph (reputation, for example.) In web3, ENS + MetaMask replaces SSO as the de facto log-in, allowing web3 identity to integrate with applications beyond a given identity provider’s ecosystem. Eventually wallets will become more like profiles, with native NFT integration for profile pictures, RabbitHole integration for on-chain resumes, and mirror + NFT marketplaces for on-chain portfolios. Interactions between identities will be combined to create an open social graph. Of course, not all interactions will be on chain, but what settles on-chain will allow developers to:\n\n* Create friend-matching mechanisms based on NFT ownership, DAO membership, social token ownership, and protocol usage\n* Better curate communities\n* Establish community-based delegated credit based on proven membership in particular DAOs\n* Develop a[ web of trust](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3375436), the ultimate path towards decentralized reputation and un/undercollateralized lending which ties all of the activity on web3 social networks right back to DeFi again. Social tokens could be used as collateral to bootstrap reputation until we have a full web of trust\n\n[https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1419773010425401353](https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1419773010425401353)\n\n### It’s Always about Identity\n\nThe non-persistence of online identity is probably the biggest obstacle to effectively utilizing this open social graph. As web2 evolved, users moved away from using their real identities. Finsta, anon, and alt accounts became the norm. On web3 people have public .eth addresses complemented by many other private addresses. Identity is important to social protocols, though, because it creates social accountability, which is totally missing in web2 and DeFi. Incentives (different levels of access or better DeFi rates) could be offered for higher levels of attestation, which could include Proof of Humanity, POAP, and Proof of Participation. Incorporating zero-knowledge proofs into these solutions could help balance verification and privacy. Personal social tokens could also be used as a sort of identity proxy, providing an alternative to hardcoding identity on-chain for those that value privacy more highly.\n\n![Based on https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1413631784135192576](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7da1ebba-59e7-4624-80c3-983a21f785d0.jpg?height=356&width=1026)\n\n## Web3 Will Not Fix Everything\n\nSocial exchange theory totally broke down on web2.[ Key concepts of social exchange theory](https://start-thinking.com/sm-and-comm-theories) include reciprocity, fairness and negotiated rules, with information, approval, respect, power, group gain and personal satisfaction among the rewards in successful transactions. Web3 restores critical elements of social exchange.\n\n> ***That said, technology doesn’t eliminate natural human instincts and, therefore, technology alone won’t prevent some of the toxic elements of web2 from creeping into web3.***\n\nWeb3 will still be about brand and status, cliques and clubs, and one-upping everyone else. Web3 is still addicting — just ask anyone on OpenSea at 4am. Nobody really knows the consequences of day-trading culture and scarcity networks that reward status and profit above all else. People who can’t afford to will lose millions trying to fit in.⁴ This system of in-groups will exacerbate the industry’s lack of diversity.\n\n> If web3 really is about culture, then we should ask ourselves how representative the culture we’re talking about is and if these networks are actually open or designed to reinforce [preferential attachment models](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment).\n\n[https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1430997412756262914](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1430997412756262914)\n\nThe biggest opportunity web3 has relative to web2, is that web3 doesn’t have to be zero-sum. It’s multi-player and participants literally have a vested interest in each other and the quality of the communities they build. The value generated by web3 should at least accrue to those creating art, contributing content, and building lasting communities rather than siloed monopolies. Participants will finally have a voice and a vote.\n\nIt feels like we are at a web3 inflection point, but we are nowhere near mainstream yet. NFT users are in the lower double digit millions relative to the roughly 4 billion users of web2 social networks. Web2 social networks have generated trillions in marketcap…. imagine what web3 can generate and then consider that it more effectively scales.\n\nPeter Thiel has[ a theory](https://sacks.substack.com/p/your-startup-is-a-movement?r=5eprj&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=twitter%20Looks%20rare.) that the best startups are like cults that believe something true. Web3 certainly feels like a cult and whether it’s about culture, status, or scarcity, people believe that it is true.\n\nWeb3.

It lies lazily on the ground and sleeps with the stone lion, which brought me to mind when he was small. As a little dog, he wouldn’t lie on his stomach like this. He always jumped up and down. When he saw people, he would rush into their arms. While time is flowing, it has gradually become a wolf dog. Maybe old dogs like to lie on the ground and sleep lazily. He has accompanied me for a long time, but I also know that every dog can only accompany one person for a period of time in life, because its life will end in a few years, even though I know that his remembrance will live with me forever.\n\nI was gonna say that after the dog died, I would find a mountain, dig a pit and bury it, and then put up a gravestone. If I have time I can bring some food and toys to visit him in the future. It’s also very good. Unfortunately, I’m very busy, because I expect there will not be much time. I may only go there a few times a year.\n\nI hace seen some metaverse real estate projects before. At that time, I thought it would be great if there were not only real estate, but also the so-called land that could be used as a graveyard for our dear pets. As a result, speak of the devil-here’s Metagrave now, which as a metaverse grave platform is quite popular these days. I guess that such a platform could only offer honoring relatives and friends. Finally, after carefully browsing the various promotion documents about it, I found that we could also buy graves for pets.\n\nSimply imagine, anytime, anywhere, as long as you have a mobile phone or a computer, you can log on to such a platform to find the unique graveyard of my dog. In this grave, not only does the property right belong to my dog, but also I can see my dog with AI combination as lively as before, and I really feel like an old friend who has been with me for a long time, although he left me, still by my side. I can store all kinds of photos in this tomb, from the ones of a newborn baby dog to the years when he grew old and slept next to a stone lion. It is really a wave of memories.\n\nMy pet is a dog, but I have many other friends who like to keep pets, not only dogs, but also cats, hamsters, and even snakes! There are all kinds of strange things, but what we have in common is that we have a very deep relationship with pets.If one day we have to lose our pets, I believe we all feel sad and miss them very much.

{"id": "BHc2N2Qi6IHajlePX7XUdUZV2gKZq1fpvmYIGwb8Ako", "title": "Bankless：如何分析各类 NFT 基本面？", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i209QwEU1-fUaIcsC_TEi.png?height=254&width=853)\n\n 随着 NFT 概念的快速发展并逐渐走向成熟，目前我们已经看到了很多不同的 NFT 形式，包括但不限于艺术、PFP、收藏品、元宇宙虚拟资产、游戏道具、工具、音乐、数字土地等等。\n\n当分析一个特定的 NFT 时，重要的是要注意其类别。每个类别都有独特的问题，你必须找到对应问题的答案，才能有效地判断其价值。\n\n本文将围绕比较具有代表性的几类 NFT 资产展开，向你展示在分析这些 NFT 的基本面时，分别需要关注哪些不同的关键元素。\n\n## 加密艺术\n\n要分析一个艺术品 NFT，首先要搞清楚以下六个基本问题。\n\n**艺术家是谁？**\n\n通过探索艺术家的其他作品、网站以及社交媒体上的履历和背景，对其进行背景调查。了解一个艺术家的故事，可以了解作品背后的人，以及他们的创作实践与 NFT 相关的「方法」和「初心」，而这非常重要。\n\n**作品的题材是什么？**\n\n目前 NFT 艺术品同样分为很多类，其中概念艺术、生成艺术、像素艺术、音乐和摄影是当下在 NFT 生态系统中最具吸引力的内容。因此，注意到一件作品的类型将帮助你更好地了解它的背景和在 NFT 艺术领域中的地位。 \n\n**艺术品的技术特点是什么？**\n\n要注意 NFT 的设计。艺术家是否将其铸造为以太坊上的 ERC721 代币？还是 Polygon 上的 ERC1155？作品的元数据是否通过 Arweave 这样的去中心化存储解决方案来存储，还是完全在链上维护元数据？回答这些问题将帮助你了解一个艺术 NFT 的技术基础设施。\n\n**艺术品的美学特征是什么？**\n\n艺术品的审美价值可以归结为该作品如何向观众传达快乐或不快乐的情绪。因此，当我们寻找一件作品的美学特征时，我们考虑的是它的内容、形式、视觉和谐感以及留白等等。\n\n**作品的总量以及是否是系列作品？**\n\n艺术家是否将作品作为一次性的、1/1 的 NFT 铸造？1,000 个的版本？还是该作品是一个更大的相互关联的系列作品的一部分，而这些作品是在持续创作的？这往往能侧面反映出作者对这个作品的重视程度。 \n\n**该作品的市场表现如何？**\n\n需要综合考量该作品最初的首发销售数据（当时的 ETH 价格和美元价值等）以及任何后续的二次销售数据。我们可以从 cryptoart.io 上搜索这些信息。\n\n## 收藏品 / PFPs\n\n**创作者是谁？**\n\n团队的才能和在加密生态中的履历很重要。还要考虑该团队是公开的、半公开的（即一些成员是假名或匿名的），还是完全匿名的。这并不是说匿名团队本身不好，只是匿名者的可靠程度确实会打一些折扣。\n\n**该系列的技术特点是什么？**\n\n注意 NFT 是在什么链上铸造的？他们使用什么代币标准？他们如何实现（是否使用 ERC721A 等）？他们如何处理元数据存储？等等。\n\n**艺术表现力如何？**\n\n一个拥有令人难忘的、视觉冲击力强的、有魅力的或无法记忆的艺术作品集总是一个好兆头。不过这也是这个分析过程中最主观的部分。 \n\n**总量是如何设计的？**\n\n评估一下该系列的总供应量。是一万个还是两万个。研究一下团队是否保留了整体供应的一大部分也很重要。举例来说，goblintown.wtf 的创建者就保留了该系列总量的十分之一为自己所有。\n\n**社区表现如何？**\n\n考虑一个项目的社区的声誉，并亲自观察它的社区活跃度。\n\n**收藏品的市场是什么样子的？**\n\n你要审查诸如底价、交易量、市值、持有人数量等等。审查这些统计数字将帮助你了解项目的市场活动的脉搏。\n\n**路线图是什么？**\n\n注意该项目公开声明的计划。这个收藏品是故意没有路线图，还是有一个庞大的、充满各种未来计划的路线图？\n\n**有哪些使用案例？**\n\n还要注意有关的收藏品或 PFP 是否赋予了任何额外的功用，例如能够用它们来赚取 ERC20 代币、为持有人提供衍生作品白名单、参与 DAO 治理等等。\n\n## 游戏\n\n**创作者是谁？**\n\n有成功的游戏设计师和游戏资深人士加入的团队是一个好兆头。换句话说，以游戏为生的人才有能力制作伟大的游戏。\n\n**是什么类型的游戏？**\n\n网络游戏、角色扮演游戏、体育游戏和贸易类游戏是当代 NFT 游戏场景中比较常见的一些类型。你所分析的项目在这个场景中处于什么位置？有些类型，如 MMO，会更复杂，而其他类型则会简单得多。\n\n**NFT 的技术特点是什么？**\n\n注意 NFT 是在什么链上铸造的（Ethereum、Polygon、Ronin、Arbitrum 等），他们的代币标准、实施风格等等。目前绝大多数的 Web3 游戏都建立在低成本的侧链或二层（L2）的扩展解决方案上。\n\n**NFT 如何影响游戏的整体设计？**\n\n你要考虑 NFTs 如何在游戏本身中使用，以及创作者如何将 NFTs 作为一种商业模式。他们是否直接向用户出售 NFT，如果是，有多少，以什么速度？他们是否依靠版税和游戏内经济费用的收入？他们的 NFT 方法看起来是周到和可持续的，还是笨拙和短视的？如果一个游戏项目似乎更专注于 NFT，而不是建立一个真正合理的游戏，这就是一个危险信号。相比之下，Axie Infinity 是一个首先关注游戏性的团队的例子，他们的 Axie NFTs 就着重服务于游戏性本身。\n\n**游戏是否已经上线？**\n\n许多 NFT 游戏项目在其游戏建成或可玩之前就发布了 NFTs。已经有可玩游戏的项目风险相对较小。\n\n**路线图是什么？**\n\n最后，一定要注意游戏开发团队公开声明的计划。这个项目的下一步是什么？他们到目前为止是否及时兑现了他们此前的路线图计划？\n\n## 具有纪念意义的 NFTs\n\n我并不是这个类别的专家。不过，数据科学家和 NFT 历史学家 Chainleft 是这个话题的权威，他最近写了一篇题为「在历史背景下定义 NFT」的有见地的文章，在文章的最后，Chainleft 强调了五个基本因素，人们在分析那些「记录历史」的 NFT 的可收集性时会重点关注的一系列元素，分别是「时间戳」、「稀缺性」、「创造性」、「技术成就本身」以及「基于哪个链铸造」。\n\n![https://r.sinaimg.cn/large/article/3dd36643c75931d507ca97b6b57bbf14](https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/mw1024/6374fa6ely4h3zadove68j20n20cedkw.jpg)\n\n## 元宇宙 / 数字土地\n\n如果你想分析一个来自元宇宙项目的虚拟土地 NFT，你可以从回答以下问题开始。\n\n**创作者是谁？**\n\n考量该项目开发团队在 Web3 方面的经验和记录。\n\n**NFT 的技术特点是什么？**\n\n数字土地是在 Ethereum、Polygon 还是在其他哪条链上发行？\n\n**NFT 的供应动态是如何设计的？**\n\n研究一个项目是否有固定的供应总量还是可以提供无上限的土地供应是关键。另外，土地是以什么速度释放的？是否有公开的时间表，还是发布过程是临时性的？\n\n**这个虚拟世界是否容易建造？**\n\n当涉及到创建土地「建设」时，那些操作门槛不高的项目更具吸引力。如果你不能在上面做其他事情来累积价值，那么购买土地就没有意义。\n\n**虚拟世界是否可以进入？**\n\n这个虚拟世界是开放的，可以自由使用的，还是一个被封锁的数字花园？人们是否可以在不持有土地的前提下在虚拟世界中创造和享受社会空间？当然，对于用户来说，越方便越好。\n\n**世界内的位置如何？**\n\n位置，位置，位置。例如，考虑基于 Ethereum 的虚拟世界 Voxels 的 Origin City 部门是该项目中最古老和最理想的土地。研究世界内地点的背景，以更好地了解它们和它们的可取性。\n\n**有多少活跃用户？**\n\nNFT 是来自一个现在是虚拟鬼城的项目，还是有大量铁杆用户？\n\n**项目的市场是什么样子的？**\n\n审查诸如底价、交易量、市值、持有人数量等要素。\n\n## 工具\n\n工具类 NFTs 是指除了作为艺术品、收藏品、虚拟地契等之外，对特定目的有用的 NFTs。在这个类别中，有两类流行的 NFT，分别是是域名 NFT 和会员 NFT。在分析此类实用 NFT 时，需要探讨的一些问题包括：。\n\n**创作者是谁？**\n\n如果熟悉这个领域的规则有足够的经验，那自然很棒。\n\n**附带的使用价值如何？**\n\n你可以用一个 ENS 的名字来管理钱包和去中心化的网站，或者会员制的 NFT 可以提供参与未来 NFT 发售的资格。研究有关 NFT 的实际作用和工作方式是了解其价值的关键。\n\n**实用性能持续多长时间？**\n\n一个实用的 NFT 可能为持有它的人无限期地提供好处，或者像 ENS 名称一样，在到期时必须定期更新和重新注册。了解实用性 NFT 的维护和保养成本同样是判断其价值的关键\n\n \n\n \n\nWeChat1：victeam005\n\nWeChat2：shijie20170405 \n Telegream：[https://t.me/VICOINDAOCHAT](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2FVICOINDAOCHAT) \n Twitter：[@VICOINDAO](https://weibo.com/n/VICOINDAO)", "timestamp": 1657246074, "digest": "gF3iBBCKCQqdu4CExghhouTu-LDbqaMgEAZc5JnJulE", "contributor": "0xf6e546668c397dcb64767efe331904Ba147D5025"}

Clarke.*\n\n在机器和人类语言之间的边缘地带游走像是一种魔法。 在一个编译器理论方面有梦想的区块链开发者的眼中，时间似乎在膨胀，以前看不见的通信模式变得逐渐清晰。 在与 Bucky Kittinger 的谈话中，我开始意识到，对他而言，探索最前沿的东西就像是在花园分叉小路上自在的漫步。\n\n我们的视频通话开始后，Bucky坐在一堵漂亮的吉他墙前。他的言谈举止给人一种明显的美国南部气息，在我们交谈了一会儿之后，我感觉到，他对区块链技术的前沿探索像是在弗吉尼亚州的农田耕作，乘着光轮去浏览创世纪的数字景观。\n\n这次与Bucky的对话涉及广泛的领域。包括从他早期通过《塞尔达传说》获得的灵感、他对EOS社区的想法、对ARM架构的支持，以及EOS如何在「应用程序执行军备竞赛的最后一站」与NatiVM竞争等等话题。\n\nBucky 是共识级别的区块链架构师和工程师，自 2016 年以来一直在探索裸机和高性能区块链解决方案之间的前沿技术。在拉德福德大学完成计算机科学学士学位后，Bucky 开始在弗吉尼亚理工大学编译器理论和计算机体系结构专业攻读博士学位。 后来他加入了 Block.one ，负责构建下一代区块链解决方案。 Bucky 现在在 EOS 网络基金会担任首席工程师，致力于基础技术的再生和重启阶段，旨在进一步推动EOS成为一流的Web3智能合约平台和区块链生态系统。\n\n> **从根本上说，区块链存在哪些问题？**\n\n就我个人而言，我觉得区块链中存在的主要问题之一是当前解决方案的普遍实用性、延迟问题、吞吐量问题、用户体验等等。这意味着大多数人无法实现很多想法或新的解决方案，因为您拥有的CPU的数量或成本、RAM的价格以及这些类型的问题带来的极端限制。\n\n而我希望看到和钻研的更重要的领域，包括性能、延迟和编译器问题。再次强调，只有最大限度地减少这些东西的成本，才可以拥有精心设计和复杂的智能合约，这些可以带来的进步不仅仅是将代币 从账户a 转移到账户 b，再从账户 b 转移到账户 c这么简单。\n\n在区块链级别还有很多现在不存在的东西，因为代价太昂贵了，或者说无法短时间内实现。因此现有的编程模型非常可怕；你将面临很多精神煎熬，例如我在这里切断状态并保存，然后返回并进行可重入式的操作，该如何进行？\n\n从我们目前所看到的情况来看，不是很好，对吧？ 您最终可能会出现错误并损失数百万美元。 我希望看到更容易应对这一层面的问题，更容易建立起这些更复杂、更繁琐的系统，而不是只做最低限度的工作。\n\n> **您参与过哪些比较著名的项目？**\n\n在Block.one，我创建了EOSIO.CDT，EOSVM，并在EOS上做了很多基础性的工作。我还为EOSIO合约做了不少贡献，并且和大多数核心工程师一样对各种开发工作都有涉猎。除此之外，我的博士学位可能是唯一值得注意的事情。我撰写了一些关于编译器理论、计算机结构、综合测试等方面的论文。\n\n从发展历史的角度而言，延迟和吞吐量一直是阻碍区块链大规模采用的大问题。因此，对我来说，DPOS允许EOS和基于它的其他链成为性能最强和可扩展的解决方案类型，因为我们可以比其他链更多地对硬件进行优化。\n\n> **最初是什么让您接触到了DPOS和EOSIO，又是什么让您留在了这里？**\n\n最初最初让我接触 DPOS的事情是它的功利性承诺。我一直想看到的最好的事情是区块链能够普及，我们可以把它作为一种技术产品，让真正的普通人从这项美丽的技术中获益。\n\n如上所述，延迟和吞吐量在历史上一直是关于吸收和采用的大问题。 所以对我来说，DPOS 允许 EOS 和其他基于其构建的链，成为最具性能和可扩展性的解决方案类型，因为我们可以比其他链更多地对硬件进行优化。我们可以对我们想要支持或反对的东西做出正确的取舍或优化。\n\n而以太坊和许多其他链不能，因为他们的模式不是由几个人生产区块，而是有许多人验证区块。所以他们最终将系统设计成能够在土豆上运行。也就是说，它可以在你的智能手机上运行，也可以在国家实验室里的高性能计算的HPC上运行。所以他们真的不能做很多假设。\n\n> **您刚刚说 — 土豆？**\n\n（笑）是的。这是指非常便宜的硬件。就像一个土豆，里面有电线。\n\n另一方面，EOS 可以说他们将拥有相对较好的硬件。因此，如果我们对这些东西进行优化，我们知道我们可以把CPU成本降到最低，对特定类型的硬件扩展进行优化，降低RAM成本，或者围绕I/O操作进行设计。\n\n无论如何，几乎所有其他链最终都会在这场比赛中跌到谷底。原因是，所使用的硬件是昂贵的、定制的，或远远超出了普通人的承受能力。所以，通过使用好的硬件，我们正在优化现实，而不是理论上的空想。\n\n> **那么为什么是 EOS？ EOS 的核心价值主张是什么，或者您希望做什么？**\n\n那么为什么是 EOS？ 好吧，它始于一个良好的社区和巨大的潜力，我仍然认为社区存在，它现在只是被埋没，并且有点破灭了，我认为如果我们能够重新开始履行最初宣布的承诺，那我们依然有一个很好的基础来重建。\n\n在某种程度上，这有点像建立一家公司，并且您已经拥有至少在某些时刻对其感兴趣的人。 还有一个好处是，我们已经有了一些基础，而不必去引导构建一个全新的生态系统。\n\n现在，我认为在重建这种信任方面需要做很多事情。 这也正是目前我们全力做的事情。 只要我们继续做人们期望的事情，并希望让EOS链朝着人们赚钱的正确方向发展，那么其余的一切自然会随之而来。\n\n此外，就我个人而言，我有很多技术方面的未完成的事情，我希望实现的技术方向，它们在我脑海中已经存在多年了。\n\n我仍然认为当前区块链和加密行业的发展格局仍处于令人难以置信的新生和边缘状态，但一旦我们能够缩小这种技术在普及率方面的差距，我们将能够看到该技术的实际好处以及它能走多远。\n\n> **您提到过 EOS 可能会实现一些最初的承诺。您认为这些承诺该怎么描述呢？**\n\n我的感受是：其中一个是对普及度的推动。 当说到普及度时，我指的是区块链为所有人服务，包括为日常的普通互联网用户及加密货币的狂热用户服务。 我仍然认为目前的区块链和加密货币的前景处在令人难以置信的新生地带和技术前沿，但一旦我们能够扩大普及度，我们将能够看到区块链技术的实际好处以及它的未来。\n\n在 Block.one领导时，我认为我们走了不少弯路。 我仍然认为 EOS 有望成为更稳定的链之一，而且它是最具潜力的链之一。 但我也要具体指出：可扩展性、真正顶级的专业环境、以及成为最安全、最有利可图的链都是我希望看到EOS发展的方向。\n\n> **您居住的地方的加密货币场景或开发者社区是什么样的？**\n\n我住在Christiansburg，就在弗吉尼亚州Blacksburg附近。加密场景相当多样化。这里有意识坚定的加密技术拥护者，加密技术阴谋论这，纯粹的技术人员和对于加密技术一知半解的普通人。\n\n造成这种情况的主要原因是弗吉尼亚州理工大学就在这附近，这里属于农村地区，主要就只有农业和科学研究，因此，除了农场耕作或创建区块链之外，没有其他什么可做的。\n\n因为弗吉尼亚理工大学是一所规模相当大的大学，它吸引了相对多元化的人群。 我认为，就大型加密社区而言，在Christiansburg、Blacksburg地区仍处于初级阶段，但这里的人都是坚定的拥护者。 在该地区有些人之前通过 Block.one进入加密社区，还有一些人通过 Block.one 初步接触了区块链领域。 现在他们都开始推动自己的计划和开发，这很酷。\n\n> **您有什么故事？您的区块链之旅是怎样的？**\n\n我在弗吉尼亚州Christiansburg的一个小养牛场长大。 我进入计算机科学领域是因为我在朋友的 NES 上玩了《塞尔达传说》，我非常喜欢这款游戏。 我想，我需要想出一种方法，来为自己创造一个像《塞尔达传说》一样的游戏！\n\n我从小家里就很穷。因此，最初学习编程的很多日子都是用学校的电脑，利用午休或放学后的时间自行学习。 另外，我买不起任何种类的书，所以早期的日子是一场艰苦的战斗。\n\n这些事情发生在小学后期及初中的时候，大概是90年代初到中期。 我上学时，学校有一台大型主机，当时可以连接到弗吉尼亚理工大学。 我利用这台大型主机，玩那些字母和数字落下来的蹩脚游戏。还有一个大的点阵打印机，发出「嘎吱嘎吱」的声音，这在当时是非常古老的技术。\n\n但是后来我厌倦了那台机器，并尝试每天搜索文件系统之后，我发现了一个奇怪的basic解释器，于是开始思考如何用basic语言编程，这就是我学习编程的开始。（笑）\n\n在中学时，学校升级了图书馆的计算机实验室，所以我开始使用新的计算机，并发现QBasic被装在system32文件夹的深处，我开始编写QBasic程序，这很有趣。你知道那时的互联网像是狂野西部，无法找到任何东西。有位老师给了我一本书，我现在仍然保存着，内容是关于QBasic编程。\n\n我尝试做了各种不同的东西。 但问题是编程速度非常慢，所以我想制作《塞尔达传说》似的游戏是不可能的。\n\n> **所以这就是您开始编译器理论研究的原因，对吗，因为您觉得，这太慢了！**\n\n是的，它太慢了，这可能就是真正的原因，因为我一直希望推动性能变得越来越强。我有点走火入魔，从QBasic跳到了汇编程序，因为当时电脑上唯一的东西就是微软的汇编程序，当时电脑上还没有C语言编译器或C++编译器，所以我想，就先从基础的汇编开始。然后我开始写汇编，不久之后我发现了Linux，并发现它有C和C++编译器，于是开始学习C，并沿着这个路线前进。\n\n> **您的家人如何看待这一切？**\n\n他们并不认为这是一件好事。 认为我只是在做的一件书呆子才做的事，他们经常说：\n\n有一天他会长大，做真正的工作；\n\n他只是三分钟热度；\n\n别担心，这只是一个阶段，他会长大的…\n\n然而，我一直没有改变，好像从来没有长大一样。\n\n高中毕业后，我为我父亲工作了四年，我几乎把所有的钱都存了起来，然后自己读完了本科，然后马上进入了研究生阶段，这是一条奇怪的成长道路。\n\n> **您在哪里读的本科？**\n\n我在拉德福德大学读的本科。离家乡Christiansburg大约5分钟路程。\n\n> **您是如何从计算机科学专业的本科生直接进入博士生阶段的？**\n\n当我读本科时，我最终结识了计算机架构教授和编译器教授（Ian Barland 博士和 Ned Okie 博士）。教授们说，你需要继续下去，你想过读博士吗？我说不是真的吧？，我非常吃惊。作为一个来自弗吉尼亚州的农场孩子，我觉得得到的已经足够了，与我家里的其他人相比，这已经很疯狂了。他们说，是真的，你应该读博士。所以这真的是非常刺激的一件事。\n\n所以我去找到了在弗吉尼亚理工大学的架构和编译器方面的教授，并进行了一次面试，他说：好的，你能在星期一出现吗？\n\n我说：好吧，很酷，没问题！\n\n> **那么，三年来，您在编译器理论研究上投入了全部精力？**\n\n是的。 还有计算机架构，因为我所做的另一部分工作是设计处理器扩展，为不同类型的古怪架构设计代码转换和优化等。\n\n> **好的。既然您提到了编译器理论，那就给我们简要介绍一下编译器理论。**\n\n(大笑)\n\n> **好吧，但说真的，读编译器理论博士的实际成果是什么？**\n\n我关注的一件事是如何在超嵌入式物联网框架中，为能量收集系统或严重电源故障的系统问题进行计算，并确保在某个点上程序得到完全执行。 这也是我当时去和 Dan (Larimer) 交谈的另一个原因，我看到了超嵌入式系统和智能合约执行层的某些相似之处。 自从那次会面后，我对很多东西都有相同的愿景和需求。\n\n> **您能否解释一下什么是电源故障，以及为什么这个概念可能与区块链有关？**\n\n如果你有一个能量收集系统或任何一种电源会随机切断的系统，当你恢复系统时，系统运行将从头开始，如果你没有足够的能量继续维持计算进行，将会导致正在发生的计算中断及失败。\n\n因此，这些类型的问题是，很多这些小型传感器或纳米物联网设备将在这些程序流上运行，你不希望计算被切断，那你会陷入就像西西弗斯一样的状态，不断地试图把大石头往山上推。然后没到山顶就会滚落，永远也无法把巨石推上山顶，所以你永远无法真正达成你的目的。\n\n这就是所谓的停滞。这是一个大问题。所以我用了三到四种不同的方法来解决这个问题，有些是用硬件，有些是用完全由编译器指导的方法。\n\n我的目标是希望将其中的一些方法带到 EOSIO 中，但我们从未真正做到这一点，真的是因为要做的事情太多了，没有额外的时间。 此外，我在弗吉尼亚理工大学设计了许多特定领域的优化，我一直想带来这些优化，但也没有完全实现。\n\n因为对我来说，真正可以做的有形的事情是，创建存在于区块链上的运行时间更长的流程。开始在区块链上做更多正常类型的开发模式。在这些真正抽象的模型中，每个人都必须不断思考这些非常抽象的模型，比如我只有 0.5 秒的时间来做这个计算。 我怎么做？我该如何在心里把这个程序组织起来，并在非常小的时间窗口中有效地运行呢？\n\n我还想要做的一件事是，允许这些运行时间更长的计算完全自然地存在于程序中，工程师无需做任何额外工作。\n\n因此，如果我们查看可用于运行程序的小的能量缓冲区及智能合约执行的停滞，它们存在很多相似之处，都会在控制流期间突然被「随机」切断。 对于智能合约，通过明确的状态模式并将状态保存在表中，或通过操作传递返回，并尝试创建可重入的操作或长期运行的逻辑操作，可以在不同程度上有效地解决这一问题。\n\n> **那么，为什么要在编译器上下功夫呢？**\n\n我只是喜欢底层级别的系统，还有编译器。如果你是一个真正喜欢底层级别技术的人，那你要么选择操作系统研究，要么选择编译器研究，我选择了编译器，因为对我来说，它们就像一个神奇的东西。可以把这个人类可读的东西，优化成了一个令人难以置信的东西，这很酷。\n\n> **聊聊您在EOSIO CDT（合约开发工具包）的工作，以及为什么您认为它需要进行改造。**\n\nEOSIO.CDT现在在Mandel中只是CDT，是一个合约开发工具包，包括一组工具链、编译器链接器、创建库的所有功能、EOSIO Web Assembly (Wasm) 的相关功能、优化功能、用于生成特定于 EOSIO 的代码的语言扩展、对某些区块链结构进行抽象，用于调试和测试的库支持，以及用于在EOSIO区块链上工作的实际基本库。\n\n因此，当我创建CDT时，我为它设定了几个目标。这些目标是要达到令人难以置信的性能、安全、可靠、以及易于使用，我真的很想在社区参与方面发挥更大的能力。\n\nCDT也带来了几个大问题。首先，我不希望它只是C++。在当时，大家都说C++是唯一存在的东西，这是一个很大的烙印，所以我不得不接受这一点，但我更希望我们可以在某个时候，把项目迁移到更抽象的地方。其他问题与实用性和易用性有关。同样，我们也没有达到目的。因为当时的重点不是工具开发。\n\nCDT的大部分工作，都是我在三年的空闲时间里完成的，所以在这个领域做任何事情都很难有任何动力。我一直在努力追赶，而不是只想把这些基础的事情做好。\n\n> **所以您一定很高兴能成为EOS网络基金会的一员，并且能够与一个希望您真正投入精力的团队一起在这方面进行第二次开发尝试。 这对您来说意味着什么？**\n\n是的，我非常高兴。当我来到EOS网络基金会时，我一开始与Yves（La Rose）谈的主要事情之一，就是这个重生和重启的概念。改正我们做错的事情，或者继续开始第一次做的时候没有做完的事情，有点像有一个平行的宇宙，一切都在朝着一个好的方向发展。\n\n四年后，我们会处在一个完全不同的地方，而不是现在这样。所以我想，EOS网络基金会绝对是一个值得去的地方。我非常兴奋地看到，能够真正拥有大量倾听者，而且人们同样对我以前关注的事情感兴趣，前景非常明朗。\n\n生态系统应该包罗万象，我认为人们普遍意识到，如果你有一个生态系统，它就应该具备生态系统的样子，你提供的不仅仅是一个小部件，然后仅此而已。你必须开始建立起这个生态系统，如果你不这样做，那么一切就不会发生。这就是我们要走的路。\n\n我在Block.one工作期间想出了一个比喻，我现在仍然喜欢这个比喻；如果你去建造世界上最快的汽车，但没有人驾驶它，那么你实际上是建造了世界上最慢的汽车。它压根不会动。所以对我来说，这就是问题所在。我们专注于许多其他辅助性的东西，而这些东西的吸引力或效用有限。\n\n> **那么，请聊一下您提议的CDT的后续版本，ANother TransLator Environment and Runtime，或称为[ANTLER](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/enf-project-ideas/blob/main/ANTLER/project.md)。**\n\nANTLER 和 CDT 之间的最大区别之一，它不是一直只用C++。 它仍然具有 C++，但它也将具有 C、Go 和Rust 等立即可用的编程语言。 Rust 可能会很快出现。 一段时间以来，我一直在幕后尝试相关开发。\n\n所以，关于ANTLER，我希望潜心设计一个工具生态系统，以及一种这样做的方式，在这里你可以有一定程度的，我不想说中心地位，而是一套有效构建的东西，供人们购买。\n\n仅仅因为去创建一个编译器，对我来说这还不够好。必须做一个非常好的优化编译器。我认为任何一个团队想要要实现它都要付出意想不到的努力。\n\n我们需要这些，但之后会发生什么，他们需要调试器的支持，需要分析器的支持，他们需要保障相应的生活品质，这意味着他们将不得不去自己构建它们，这又是一个完全的噩梦。\n\n所以 ANTLER 的一大目标是抽象代码生成、链接、优化器和调试器、分析器支持等概念。这样这些较小的团队就可以轻松地创建一种新语言，而不必担心其他任何问题。\n\n它还会有一个打包系统和更简单的构建系统，以抽象出这些语言，允许轻松构建更复杂的系统，并希望通过社区拥有的软件包，向开发者提供更多的代码。\n\n今天更大的问题之一是，智能合约开发人员必须非常熟悉 C++，这并不容易。 整个语言有很多陷阱，你很容易遇到问题。 因此，通过扩展支持的语言集，您就有更好的机会让开发人员更了解其中一种语言，并理解与之相关的陷阱和缺陷。\n\n如果他们已经是某种语言的专家了。那么你就能尝试抓住他们擅长的任何领域并加以利用，那么他们就有更好的机会，创建一个非常多样化的智能合约生态系统。与之相反的是，他们掌握了某种语言的知识，但却必须适应成为Wasm、用于调试的dwarf格式、静态分析和链接的专家。\n\n不是基础语言专家所面临的更大问题之一，容易造成错误并导致损失数百万美元。 所以我认为，归根结底，这方面的目标是允许人们构建这些系统，购买调试器、分析器、高度优化的编译器，并抽象出他们不关心的部分。 他们唯一关心的是它的基本语言方面。\n\n一旦你做到了这一点，事情就有希望从此开始变得更加容易，新开发者进入时，可以了解他擅长什么语言？如果擅长OCaml，社区编写了一个OCaml编译器。把这个语言规范写成OCaml，然后推向编译器，新开发者就可以开始工作了。这是ANTLER的最高（或者说崇高）目标。\n\n> **说到架构，您设计了EOS-VM，它使用Wasm（Web Assembly），我听说您也想在那里创建一个新系统？**\n\n是的，所以我想做的事情就是我所说的[NatiVM runtime](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/enf-project-ideas/blob/main/NatiVM/project.md)，它可以有效地使用x86–64，（AMD64是它的另一个名字）作为中间表示，就像我们现在使用Wasm一样。这是目前在英特尔和AMD设备中使用的核心架构或指令集。\n\n转向x86–64有几个原因。一是要利用近40年的发展。从开发人员的角度来看，我们不需要在所有这些不同类型的工具、静态分析、动态分析和分析工具上重新进行研究。我们可以购买行业标准技术。所有这些东西都已经写好了。我们不需要再去重新研发。我们可以免费继承它。这是一个很大的组成部分。\n\n另一个组成部分是Wasm的基本性能问题，以及我在Wasm中发现的一些问题，这些问题与标准的前进方向和动力有关。\n\nWasm 的另一个问题是我们可以从中获得的性能上限，这取决于编译器、现有的工具链，也取决于我们能用这种抽象的架构做什么样的总体限制，以及我们能从中产生的最低限度。\n\n因此，对于x86–64，它非常适合基于寄存器的三地址系统模型，这意味着指令集（最大）具有一个结果，即操作数1和操作数2，以及利用寄存器和内存位置的多种寻址模式。Wasm符合基于0地址堆栈的系统模型，因此它们之间会丢失细节，而且还有一个事实，因为基于堆栈的系统，寄存器分配很困难，在那里进行任何转换都是一个非常复杂的分析，而且由于别名分析问题（缺乏类型信息），您仍然无法真正达到一定的性能水平。\n\n> **那么 Wasm 不使用registers吗？**\n\n是的，对于Wasm，它的所有内容实际上都是一种内存操作。它要么是对指令编码的即时操作，要么是一个内存位置，其本身要么是内存地址，要么是合成堆栈或全局索引。所以在x86–64中，我们有这些叫做registers的东西，它是一个周期的操作，可以向其中添加东西，从中读取，写入。这就是现代体系结构的高性能来源（同时也是不得不用新数据填充这些registers，并且没有为它们进行最佳分配的地方，可能会失去性能）。\n\n因此，利用系统的registers始终是一件需要优化的大事。问题是Wasm对此没有概念。因此，最终发生的事情是，这些事情最终变成了内存读取和写入，这没有涉及到很多关于编译器的技术细节以及为什么他们不喜欢这样，最终导致了这些事情的优化问题。\n\n另一个问题是，就获得任何这些扩展而言，标准本身的发展速度非常缓慢，所以这是 Wasm 内部或我们对 Wasm 的采用的另一个持续存在的问题。 这些扩展可能是 SIMD、异常、动态模块等。\n\n一直以来，我们都有这样的心态，认为我们在某种程度上接近vanilla Wasm就能获得很多。问题是，我们总是不得不等待规范的更新和批准，并继续前进，即使如此，有些东西甚至没有在规范中，但出于性能的原因，出于开发人员的原因，出于节点操作员的原因，我们真的希望有这样的规范。\n\n有一系列我们应该做的事情，但我们不能做，因为这些事情不是Wasm的一部分，如果我们不得不继续等待这些事情，那么区块链本身将在我们实施这些事情之前就消亡了。问题在于，区块链技术的发展速度对于Wasm的发展速度来说太快了。\n\n> **所以您提出的NatiVM的解决方案将是一个新的标准？**\n\n是的\n\n> **您能否简要介绍一下 NatiVM，我也很好奇您如何看待它在整个区块链行业的应用。**\n\n最重要的事情之一是，它将是一个由我们提供的开放标准，然后希望在未来其他人对其发展方向有投入和影响。\n\n更重要的是，它将是x86–64的适当子集。在未来，我们（希望）也会有确定性ARM支持，但现在要关注的只是确定性的x86–64。任何构建工具或构建库支持的人，他们不必去编写或思考这些指令是如何被编码或解码的，已经有现成的东西了。他们只需购买现有的用于x86–64的工具包，用于运行时间和验证系统。只有基础编译器和运行时需要关注这个子集是什么。二进制格式也在范围内，比如这个标准是什么，这个应用程序本身有哪些部分，以及我们想要或想要维护的不同部分。\n\n所以这是一个组件，然后第二个更多的是VM（虚拟机）层。 内存管理是什么样的？ 内存管理系统如何以一种非常有效的方式与操作系统协同工作？ 我们怎么能保证呢？\n\n我为应用程序开发人员提供了安全方面的保障。 例如，像自动化非常低成本的canaries堆栈之类的东西，所以如果他们写错了一些东西，它应该会导致失败，那么他们就不会受到在线攻击，或被人骗取造成经济损失。\n\n我们可以保证执行root level级别的确定性。\n\n> **您在NatiVM方面进展到什么程度，是否有了清晰的实现规划？**\n\n是的，目前我视野非常清晰，一切尽在眼前。但我脑海中有很多零碎和抽象的东西，我仍然在弄清楚V1版本中会包括哪些指令。\n\n我知道我想要什么。 但是，我也想包括一些初始的SIMD。 所以，我正在权衡利弊。 Wasm 的另一个问题是诸如 SIMD 指令之类的东西，这些指令在加密函数中大量使用，我们可以使用 Wasm 实现的最大位宽是 128 位。 有「标准」的英特尔或AMD扩展，如SSE，，它们有 128、256 和 512 位操作。此外，还有区块链可以利用的其他特定扩展。\n\n我们的目标是：我们应该能够购买很多非常优化的加密函数，人们花费了大量时间，为这些非常深奥的x86–64 SSE手写指令。这样做对性能和实现的可靠性有很大的价值。因为这些加密函数已经被编写和测试过了。\n\n我看到的情况是，如果一种语言确实支持这些类型的东西，那么会以一种抽象的方式支持它们，这意味着该语言必须将它们作为特殊的东西公开，然后围绕这些东西有很多工作要做。然后是下一个版本的剧变，它必须支持这一点，整个过程会有很多的反复来回。\n\n我没有提到的关于 Wasm 的更大问题之一是确定性。 我们无法真正保证我们拥有的大多数「后端」的确定性，也确实无法保证。这是因为我们没有验证在物理机器上运行的生成代码。但是 NatiVM 的一个奇妙结果是，我们验证 x86–64 作为纯粹的确定性 x86–64。这意味着我们可以在执行的根源级别保证确定性。\n\n我将NatiVM 视为应用程序执行军备竞赛的最后一站，我们仍有其他方面需要改进的方面，但我们可以确保将执行成本降至最低 。\n\n> **因此，考虑到这是针对区块链，支持SSE和其他扩展似乎是一件大事。**\n\n是的，所以这些指令通常在计算机科学中称为向量指令。 它们允许非常大的数据集，并且您可以有效地对其中的多个数据块执行一项操作。\n\n如果您将四个64位值打包到256位寄存器中，它可能会执行一个操作，但可以使用相同的操作同时对这四件事进行操作。这也是GPU的工作方式。GPU 将有效地对一个非常大的寄存器执行一项操作，而它所操作的对象是一个大矩阵或向量。\n\n所以这些指令在密码系统中非常有用，因为你做了很多向量操作。 有了这些，您可以将性能提高 4、5 或 10 倍。拥有这些指令有很大的用处。\n\n其次，你有英特尔，随着我们向前发展，向他们的指令集中添加越来越多的加密指令，这些指令永远不会被添加到像 Wasm 这样的东西中。\n\n假设基础硬件本身并不支持指令，那也没啥问题。 我们将有效地注入将接管该操作，并模拟语义的「指令」版本，如果硬件不支持 512 位操作，那也不是问题。 它可以支持 256 位操作。 我们只是把它们分成两半，我们还是可以继续执行操作。\n\n另一件需要注意的事情是，编译成常规x86–64指令本身就是一件大事。我认为，要让人们看到我们能够编译应用程序并运行它们，其开销与在这个NatiVM管理系统之外运行的纯本机构建的代码相当，并不需要太多时间。\n\n> **也许您可以多谈谈 ARM 架构，以及如何将 x86–64 转换为二进制。**\n\n好。 很明显，ARM 是一件大有前途的事情，它会在某个时候发生。 我认为还需要几年的时间，但我认为人们不希望看到我们只能在 x86–64 架构上运行，对吧？ 这是相当局限的。\n\n因此，在确定性 x86–64 应用程序的验证阶段，我们将首先验证，然后使用恒定时间「shotgun」二进制重写器将 x86–64 转换为 ARM64。 这将是一个相当愚蠢的重写器，因为我们只支持一个子集，并且可以做出比通用系统更多的假设。Alexis Engelke等人展示了从x86–64到ARM64的转换之间有很好的优化亲和力，性能损失最小。\n\n> **这似乎是个大问题，这是否在某种程度上为EOS提供了未来？**\n\n应该是这样的。关于NatiVM，我认为它是应用程序执行军备竞赛的最后一站，我们在DB和其他方面还有待改进，但我们可以确保将执行成本降到最低，我们可以自己拥有标准，以便随着时间的推移进行适应和改变，此外，确保我们有与其他架构的兼容层应该有助于未来的EOS。\n\n> **您对那些想在区块链上构建项目的人有什么建议？**\n\n我给出的建议会比大多数人预期的要高一些。 首先专注于正确构建应用程序。 也就是说，确保应用程序的整体逻辑是可靠且经过良好测试的。 在您知道智能合约和 DApp 代码是正确的之后，您可以专注于针对 CPU、RAM 或 NET 问题，并对其进行优化。\n\n但是，首先也是最重要的只是启动项目。很多人对我说：\n\n我有这个好主意，但是…\n\n这些人是优秀的工程师，但区块链开发的特殊性使他们甚至无法启动项目。所以，要多问问题，多做尝试。\n\n> **和您谈话真的很愉快，Bucky！为未来的EOS干杯！**\n\n这是我的荣幸； 能够谈论其中一些事情很有趣。 我认为 EOS 将有一个非常成熟的未来（笑）。\n\n通过EOS和EOSIO世界级开发人员的眼睛，我们将进一步深入探索区块链的奥秘。如果您喜欢这一期《共识架构师》，欢迎您分享至社交媒体让更多人看到。\n\n您可以在点击下方链接阅读架构师共识系列中的第一篇文章：\n\n[https://medium.com/@EOSNetworkFoundation/%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9Denf%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E6%80%BB%E7%9B%91areg-%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AEeos%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E9%A1%B6%E6%B5%81web3-0%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%90%88%E7%BA%A6%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0-%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84%E5%B8%88%E5%85%B1%E8%AF%86-cac205cf53a6](https://medium.com/@EOSNetworkFoundation/%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9Denf%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E6%80%BB%E7%9B%91areg-%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AEeos%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E9%A1%B6%E6%B5%81web3-0%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%90%88%E7%BA%A6%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0-%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84%E5%B8%88%E5%85%B1%E8%AF%86-cac205cf53a6)\n\n#

Giove\n\n投资是一种对于预测的练习。精明的投资者不会基于现在的情况做决定，而是参考未来和长期价值创造的潜力。\n\n在加密货币市场，交易员目前表现出短期思维的一个领域是 L2 代币。对于有先见之明的投资者来说，这是一次巨大的机会。\n\n[https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1533100482205569030?s=20&t=p5vq3eal15JjQs5pUFyvTw](https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1533100482205569030?s=20&t=p5vq3eal15JjQs5pUFyvTw)\n\n以太坊上的 L2 Rollup 技术在用户的采用、开发者的关注和实用价值方面持续增长。它代表着 Web3 的最前沿。最近，随着 Optimism 发布 OP 代币，这些 L2 代币特别是它们的估值，已经成为了关注的焦点。\n\nOP 在整个加密货币市场上已经受到了来自交易员和投资者的怀疑。\n一起来分析我所知道的大家最担心的三个方面：\n\n#### 1.没有实用价值\n\n目前，OP 仅用于 Optimism 的社区治理 (通过 Optimism 的两院制治理系统)。在这个治理系统里，OP 持有者组成了所谓的“代币议院”（token house）。这种代币议院可以为 Rollup 生态系统内的升级和对不同项目的激励分配进行投票。\n\n#### 2.代币不会有任何增值\n\nRollup 定序者（更多内容在下文）所创造的网络收益不是直接由代币持有者获得，而是用于追溯性公共物品的募资。这个价值的分配将由 Optimism 的第二个治理分支——公民议院（citizen’s house）来决定，它通过发放不可转让的 NFT 为公民授予身份。\n\n#### 3.流通量低，未解锁供应量过剩\n\nOP 目前的市值是 1.879 亿，其完全稀释估值是 37 亿。这意味着只有 OP 总供应量的 5% 在流通。\n这些批评是有道理的，但它们只是基于目前的 OP 代币——而不是它和 L2 代币在未来的前景。\n两个估值的脱节代表着一种机遇，OP 代币以及类似的 L2 代币正处于大幅增长实用性与高度增值的路上，因为 L2 代币的未来设计将会与当下的设计截然不同。\n一起看看为什么会出现这种情况…\n\n## L2 商业模式\n\n<br/>\n\n为了更好地理解 L2 代币如何增值，读者需要先理解 L2 平台的商业模式。你可以把 Rollup 技术提供商视作区块空间的中间商：他们购买 L1 的区块空间，以更高效的方式利用区块空间，并通过 L2 将其高价卖给用户。\n\n### 收益\n\nRollup 产生收益的两个来源：交易手续费和矿工/最大可提取价值（MEV）。MEV 是寻租式的价值提取方式，投机的区块提议者（PoW 的矿工、PoS 的验证者）可以通过专门重新排序交易来完成（David 在这里解释了更多的 MEV 内容）。\n\n就像用户支付 gas 费给以太坊上的矿工或验证者一样，他们也必须向 L2 上所谓的定序者支付一笔费用。定序者负责排序、打包以及发送交易到 L1。当定序者履行确定交易顺序的职责时，他们可以通过提取 MEV 而赚得收益。\n\n![L1 和 L2 的费用排行，数据来源于 cryptofees.info](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MyTD6Onm8VGjb0ZqCGJ40.png?height=650&width=1314)\n\n### 开销\n\n为了运作，rollup 产生一些开销会通过 gas 费的形式将转嫁给用户。\n\n这个开销结构的第一个部分是在 L2 上执行交易所需的计算资源，第二个部分是打包和验证交易的开销。就 optimistic rollup 来说，它需要欺诈/错误证明，而 zkRollup 则需要零知识证明。\n\n在 L1 上发布交易数据 (即 calldata) 也会让 L2 产生一笔开销。 calldata 开销构成了所谓的\"数据可用性问题\"的核心部分，这是指在以太坊等网络上发布和存储数据的昂贵成本。\n\n![L2 费用开销排序，数据来源 l2fee.info](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fDdfyAmaR2les54L7eyRF.png?height=662&width=1194)\n\n有大量处理 L2 开销问题的解决方案正在筹备中。\n\n第一个解决方案是 Calldata 压缩，它会减少从 L2 发送到 L1 的数据大小。虽然 rollup 本身可以利用数据压缩技术，但 Vitalik 提议的即将到来的 EIP-4488 也致力于为这方面提供帮助。\n\n其他可选方案包括 danksharding 以及 proto-danksharding，它们可以增加存储在以太坊或者 Celestia (专用数据可用性层方案) 上的数据量。\n\n### 利润\n\nrollup 可以通过这个模式“获利”的方式是收取一笔“附加费用/溢价”，例如，赚取用户支付的交易费与购买 L1 区块空间的成本之间的差价。\n\n这是 Optimism 通过实现“费用比例系数”所完成的工作，即向用户收取每一笔交易的动态额外费用。Optimism 的目标在于为定序者创造 10% 的利润。这种利润代表了 L2 代币及其持有者的潜在价值来源。\n\n(译者注：“Fee Scalar” 是 Optimism rollup 向其用户收取的一笔动态开销，目前 Optimism 上的费用比例系数被设置在 1.24 倍。)\nMEV\n\nRollup 的另一个收益来源是 MEV。它逐渐成为 L2 项目之间的关键区别，每个 L2 平台处理 MEV 的方式对其原生代币在未来的增值具有重要影响。\n\n为了更好地理解这个概念，让我们探讨一下 Optimism 和 Arbitrum 在 MEV 处理方式上的差异。\n\nOptimism 正在对 MEV 采取所谓的“进攻型”方式来处理 MEV。扎根于 MEV 是区块链的基础并且试图根除它只会是徒劳的观点，Optimism 最终将纳入所谓的 MEV 拍卖（MEVA）。\n\nMEVA 试图通过将 MEV 的提取权利拍卖给价高者，以分离并重新定向 MEV 所产生的收益。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QYC5p5fCwgWw22V3-sXGr.png?height=369&width=1062)\n\nOptimism 打算将 MEVA 所赚得的收益，通过追溯性公共物品募资分配给获得资助资格的公共物品。通过这么做，L2 平台认为它将能够创造一个自我维持的生态系统，长期来说，这个系统将为**所有的利益相关者**提供更多的价值。\n\n另一方面，Arbitrum 正在采用“防御型”方法来处理 MEV，这种方法则基于 “MEV 实际上是对用户征税”的观点。Aribitrum 不会试图捕获并重新分配 MEV，而是致力于在系统范围内将它最小化。\n\n为了降低 MEV，Arbitrum 网络将会实现公平排序或公平定序，一个 batch 中的所有交易都根据它们收到的排序进行处理。在这个过程中，Arbitrum 打算降低提取的 MEV，从而减少 Rollup 的成本，也更加吸引用户和建设者。\n\n关于各个 L2 平台该如何处理 MEV 的争论是微妙且复杂的，也远远超出了这篇文章探讨的范围。但如果我们谈论的是投资战略，那么这里倒可以谈谈它对于 L2 代币增值的影响。\n\n## MEV 对你的 L2 投资策略意味着什么？\n\n进攻型 MEV 为 L2 提供了一个收入来源，它可以直接为其原生代币增值。虽然 Optimism 的 MEV 收益最初将完全用于公共物品的资助，但最终可以通过传统的单边质押池，或是通过去中心化定序者，将其中一部分甚至是全部的 MEV 收益分配给代币持有者（稍后进一步探讨）。\n\n在资助公共物品的用途上，MEV 也许能通过改善 L2 平台生态系统的总体健康和长期可持续性，帮助其代币间接地增加更多价值。\n\n虽然防御型的 MEV 剥夺了可以直接使原生代币增值或加强其生态系统的收入来源，但它可以间接提高 L2 代币的价值。用户可能更倾向于在 MEV 不那么猖獗的网络上进行交易，从而加强了网络的采用和及其网络效应。\n\n尽管哪种方法会带来更长期的采用还有待观察，但很明显，MEV 可以用于 L2 代币的增值。拥抱 MEV 的 L2 平台将比其他不采用 MEV 的平台更容易为其原生资产增加价值。\n\n## 去中心化定序者\n\n尽管 L2 代币可以将用于去中心化各种协议功能。然而，可以捕获交易费用和MEV 价值的最显而易见的方法 (同时也增强了其效用) 就是去中心化定序者。\n目前，许多出色 Rollup 上的定序者都是中心化的，由一个单一的实体运营。例如，Offchain Labs 和 Optimism PBC 分别是 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 的定序者的唯一运营商。\n\n由于每个平台都处于新生阶段，所以这些系统像护栏一样放置在那里。\n\n在未来的发展中，重要的是这些定序者最终会去中心化，以最大限度地实现抗审查。\n\n像 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 这种 L2 平台上的定序者能够利用他们的原生代币做到这一点。目前有几种去中心化定序者的设计可以成形。比如，可以通过 PoS 的方法论选出定序者。\n\n这是这种方法论的运作方式：类似于 L1 上的 PoS ，潜在的定序者会质押某个 Rollup 项目的原生代币，以获得担任该职务的权利。质押者被选中的概率会和其质押的大小成正比。被选中的新定序者能够通过赚取交易费、MEV 和潜在代币奖励的方式获取 Rollup 产生的价值。\n\n在类似于 Optimism 这种采用进攻型 MEV 策略的 Rollup 案例中，这种机制可以连同 MEV 拍卖机制一起实施：\n\n[https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1533186340933668865?s=20&t=p5vq3eal15JjQs5pUFyvTw](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1533186340933668865?s=20&t=p5vq3eal15JjQs5pUFyvTw)\n\n质押机制可以为 L2 代币提供一种实用价值来源——因此也是一种需求来源。为了加入系统并赚得上述的现金流，潜在的定序者需要在开放市场购入代币。\n\n尽管细节还未敲定，zkSync 已确定将其代币作此用途。\n\n## 道路清晰\n\nL2 代币在其用途和代币增值方面有一个明确的发展路径。Rollup 从交易费和 MEV 中产生利润，可以用作直接为原生代币增值的方式，或者通过再投资公共物品等领域以间接增值。\n\n它可以通过用于去中心化定序者或者其他协议功能 (例如通过 PoS 系统)，来捕获这种价值。这进一步为 L2 代币创造了实用价值和需求。\n如果这些代币经济看起来很相似，因为他们都反映了 ETH 代币经济本身。\n\n在合并后，ETH 将在 PoS 系统内使用，它让质押者能够以保险金、gas 费和 MEV 的形式赚取现金流。\n尽管 L2 代币不太可能出现净通缩或具有与 ETH 一样的货币溢价，但它们仍会以 \"指数溢价\"进行交易，因为它们代表着接触其各自生态系统的最广泛方式。\n\n虽然很多关于 L2 代币设计的规范仍然处于变化之中，但可以确定的是：今天 L2 的代币经济不会是明天的 L2 代币经济。\n精明的投资者应该关注每个 L2 平台如何对其代币实施增值战略，即 L2 代币在 2023

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6fKEt4gzxQekAslwM8pU.png?height=561&width=1000)\n\n其实这两天有关数据泄露的事情传的沸沸扬扬，而且在tg的一些sgk已经开始有相关的数据源可以查询了。在这里其实不鼓励大家去接触这些事情，但是同样也希望通过这个事情激起大家对个人数据安全的重视。\n\n本来DID这个话题是打算后续聊Web5的时候再谈的，但是借着这个数据泄露的事情为引子来聊聊DID这个话题和应用。\n\n这次文章我不会涉及具体项目以及具体的DID解决方案，更多的是在宏观层面上梳理DID领域，以及这个领域的哲学辩证。\n\n另外，有读者会发现我的文章中插入了一些广告，会根据广告点击的流量给一些激励。大家不嫌麻烦的话，可以随便点击一下文内推送的广告，让我赚个咖啡钱。\n\n**正文**\n\n*“Je pense, donc je suis”—— 勒内·笛卡尔*\n\n我思故我在，这是大家耳熟能详的一句哲学命题，我在网上搜索了一句比较权威的解释。\n\n“我无法否认自己的存在，因为当我否认、怀疑时，我就已经存在！”因为我在思考在怀疑的时候，肯定有一个执行“思考”的“思考者”，这个作为主体的“我”是不容怀疑的，这个我并非广延的肉体的“我”，而是思考者的我。所以，否认自己的存在是自相矛盾的。\n\n这听着可能太过于哲学，似乎跟今天文章所说的DID似乎没有关系。但其实并不然，在现代社会中，已经将身份概念混淆，明明是同一个人，但有各种身份证明，比如常见的身份证、驾驶证、社保卡、护照等等。\n\n而这些身份证明会随着你去到其他国家而失效，或者由于你没有携带证明文件而失效，这仿佛变成了“我想，但我不存在”。\n\n简单来理解，现代社会的“我”，是由各色各样的第三方机构来定义的，如果他们否认“我”，那“我”就不存在。\n\n如果读者现在依然不太能理解这个过于哲学的话题，那么我可以换另一个与大家现实生活贴切的案例来举例。\n\n在疫情几年中，相信大家对核酸码、健康码已经非常熟悉了。那么在这个环境中大家可以很清晰地感知到绿码、黄码、红码机制对人们工作生活的影响。但健康码的颜色是根据身体是否感染新冠来变更吗？其实并不是。\n\n健康码的案例中，就是典型的由他人第三方机构来根据各种防疫政策来制定的。那么此时“我”的身份自身是无法证明的，需要第三方给“我”一个身份，“我”才能正常生活。\n\n点到即止，说回标题的去中心化身份（下文简称DID，Decentralized Identifiers）。去中心化身份的概念往上追溯，其实是隶属于数字身份下的一种。而数字身份早在互联网出现的上世纪九十年代就开始有相关的技术与概念，那么我将按照时间线，结合互联网资料给大家简单梳理一下数字身份的发展简史。\n\n自互联网诞生以来，数字身份已经发展了广义的四个阶段，分别是中心化身份、联盟身份、以用户为中心的身份和自我主权身份。\n\n**第一阶段：中心化身份**\n\n中心化身份是由单一的权威机构进行管理和控制的。中央集权化的机构，像是 1988 年成立的 IANA（Internet Assigned Number Authority，互联网号码分配局）管理着 国际互联网中使用的IP地址、域名和许多其他参数。到了 1998 年，ICANN（Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers，互联网名称与数字地址分配机构）成 立，接管了包括管理域名和 IP 地址的分配等与互联网相关的任务。\n\n到了 1995 年，证书颁发机构（CA，Certificate Authority），作为负责发放和管理数字证书的权威机构，以及在电子商务中受信任的第三方，承担公钥体系中对用户的公钥进行认证，从而验证用户的身份。\n\n如果说上世纪八九十年代的例子太久远，感知不强，那么可以参考2000年后的互联网浪潮。各类门户网站兴起，各家都需要注册账号，包括后面的博客、微博，这类账号都是中心化数字身份的一种具象化。\n\n随着互联网的发展，随着权力在等级制度中积累，另一个问题被揭示出来：身份越来越被碎片化。它们随着网站的增长而成倍增加，迫使用户在数十个不同的网站上处理数十种身份，同时无法控制其中任何一个。\n\n**第二阶段：联盟化身份**\n\n20 世纪末，数字身份的发展获得了重大进展。中心化身份导致的身份数据的混乱 而零碎等弊端，催生出了联盟身份这种由多个机构或联盟管理控制的身份体系。简单地 说，用户的在线身份数据具备了一定程度的可移植性，例如允许用户登录某个网站时， 可以使用其他网站的账户信息，类似于 QQ、微信或者微博的跨平台登录。\n\n微软于 1999 年推出的 Passport 计划，首次提出了“联盟身份”的概念和解决方 案。Passport 是一个由微软控制的中央式身份认证服务，提供了中央统筹式的单一登录服务，允许用户通过一次登录就可以获得访问很多网站的权限，但是，这使得微软成 为联盟的统筹中心，拥有极大的权力。\n\n联盟化的数字身份虽然一定程度上地解决了碎片化的问题，但是这样的数字身份依然是由单一的权威机构所掌控。在这个案例中是腾讯掌控。\n\n试想一下，你的微信号如果被封禁，那么很可能你微信钱包中的资产，微信登录的游戏资产，公众号的知识资产全都会被连带着被冻结。所以你的身份数据，依然不是你的身份数据，你只是作为使用者在使用第三方权威机构给你定义的身份数据而已。\n\n第三阶段：以用户为中心的身份\n\n2001年，Identity Commons 开始整合所有有关数字身份的工作，并将工作重点集 中在去中心化上，这也推动了 2005 年互联网身份工作组（IIW，Internet Identity Workshop）的创建。IIW 强调以用户为中心的身份，在创建在线身份的过程中，将用户 放在首要和中心的地位。\n\n以用户为中心的身份，希望实现的是用户通过授权和许可，可以决定身份的存储和使用以及将身份从一个服务共享到另一个服务。因此侧重于三个元素：用户的许可、 互操作性以及基于用户对数据的完全掌控。\n\n可惜，以用户为中心的身份计划并没有获得成功。以 OpenID 为例，用户理论上可以注册属于自己的 OpenID，但是由于技术门槛较高，普通的互联网用户更倾向于在一 个公共的并且相对可靠的网站上注册 OpenID 来登录到其他的网站。因此，用户注册的 OpenID 有着随时被网络提供商剥夺的风险，这意味着，用户并没有完全取得自己身份数据的掌控权。\n\n但是，在上述数字身份之后诞生的加密数字身份在Web3世界获得了前所未见的蓬勃发展。目前区块链常见的Web3钱包地址便是一种以用户为中心的数字身份。全球已经有数千万用户通过metamask来访问Web3网站，在上述的三个元素中已经实现了用户许可、互操作性。\n\n但是在用户对数据的完全掌控这一点上，由于区块链的一大特性就是数据完全公开透明，当前加密数字身份并不能实现对自身数据的完全掌控。目前也有很多链上数据分析工具针对巨鲸用户的地址研发出跟踪功能，这对于用户来说，数据的完全掌控依然是无从谈起的。\n\n第四阶段：自我主权身份\n\n自我主权身份是以用户为中心的身份的进阶阶段，二者的共同之处在于，都以用户完全掌控自己的身份数据为出发点，但自我主权身份更进一步，数据的收集、存储和使用都去中心化地分布在一个生态系统中，同时对于个人身份的验证，允许其他的普通 用户发表含有他人身份信息的声明（即下文将提到的“可验证声明”）。自我主权身份提供了三个必需的元素：单独控制、安全性和完全可移植性。它取消了上述三个阶段的集中外部控制。身份完全由个人(或组织)拥有、控制和管理。从这个意义上说，个人是 他们自己的身份提供者——没有外部的一方可以声称为他们“提供”身份，因为身份本质上是他们的。个人的数字存在是独立于任何单一组织的。\n\n在第三阶段，我将Web3钱包列为“以用户为中心的身份”，但是在第四阶段我依然拿Web3钱包作为案例。其中让Web3钱包从第三阶段跨度到第四阶段的核心功能，便是EVM。\n\n早在2017年，那时候处于公链大战的阶段，各家公链互不相同，无论是数据还是地址还是代币都是无法跨链流转的，是一个非常典型的数据孤岛。\n\n但是EVM的普及，诞生了一大批EVM兼容链，其中就包括BSC、AVAX、HECO等等。而EVM兼容链的蓬勃发展，也弥补上了在第三阶段中Web3钱包对可移植性的一大缺失。\n\n大家经常操作EVM兼容链时会发现，只要配置好了对应EVM兼容链的RPC，那么就可以用原先的以太坊地址去访问对应的EVM兼容链，这已经实现自我主权身份的所有基本要素。对整个区块链行业而言，EVM 可能比以太坊区块链本身更重要。\n\n*（数字身份发展部分内容来自时戳资本去中心化身份研究报告（2019），内容有所删减且加上个人观点。完整报告可在文末获取。）*\n\n**开源DID标准与Web3 DID发展方向**\n\n其实在现在，已经有两套开源且相对成熟的DID标准。分别是W3C DID标准与Decentralized Identity Foundation，即 DIF。\n\n其中W3C DID更类似定义标准，而DIF则是解决方案。其中的技术逻辑受限于我自身的知识面不够，所以并未深究。但是可以知道的是，市面上关于DID的Web3项目，其解决方案大多从这两套开源DID标准演变而来。\n\n那么现在探寻的Web3 DID方向已经不在于DID解决方案的技术如何优异，而是如何将这些DID解决方案落实在应用中。\n\n具体而言，包括POAP、RSS3、Project Galaxy、rabbithole等等项目，他们都是围绕着Web3加密身份衍生出的DID方向的应用。比如POAP、Project Galaxy、rabbithole通过分析用户的链上数据交互行为，来赋予各类身份认证或者徽章，这样的身份认证摆脱了第三方权威机构的单一控制，你一旦获取到了对应的身份，那么将会被区块链所永久存储并且可验证。\n\n而RSS3的项目目标是做 Web3 世界的 RSS 规范。项目愿景是让用户自己掌握内容的所有权和订阅权，并以不依赖中心化平台的方式进行内容聚合和呈现。RSS3 将用户创作的内容保存在Arweave上，在存储层面实现了去中心化，以及用户对内容的控制权。\n\n这些项目并不是大家所认为的在研发DID标准协议，更多的是基于现有以Metamask为首的Web3 DID来研发应用场景。切实地确保用户在Web3的加密身份验证、用户对内容的控制权领域上有真实的应用场景。\n\n当然，目前依然有很多项目在深耕DID的技术方案，以求在安全性、技术性上有更大的突破。但这可能会陷入到2017年公链战争中的场景中。虽然DID技术方案百家齐放，各有不同，但是互相却并不能兼容。而DID的可移植性反而才是重中之重，不能说我换一个Web3应用，我的DID身份就失效了。\n\n现在谈DID技术方案，我会将其类比为当年谈公链共识算法的差异化。但无论哪种技术方案，最终能绽放异彩的无疑是具体应用产品。\n\n那么在当下情况，基于EVM的Web3钱包账户体系，就是一个现阶段完美的DID框架。基于此，去实现更多用户真实可用的产品才是Web3 DID发展方向。绝大部分用户并不会使用或者研究DID的标准，但是他们可以直接使用到基于DID的应用。\n\nWeChat1：victeam005\n\nWeChat2：shijie20170405 \n

pense, donc je suis”—— 勒内·笛卡尔*\n\n我思故我在，这是大家耳熟能详的一句哲学命题，我在网上搜索了一句比较权威的解释。\n\n“我无法否认自己的存在，因为当我否认、怀疑时，我就已经存在！”因为我在思考在怀疑的时候，肯定有一个执行“思考”的“思考者”，这个作为主体的“我”是不容怀疑的，这个我并非广延的肉体的“我”，而是思考者的我。所以，否认自己的存在是自相矛盾的。\n\n这听着可能太过于哲学，似乎跟今天文章所说的DID似乎没有关系。但其实并不然，在现代社会中，已经将身份概念混淆，明明是同一个人，但有各种身份证明，比如常见的身份证、驾驶证、社保卡、护照等等。\n\n而这些身份证明会随着你去到其他国家而失效，或者由于你没有携带证明文件而失效，这仿佛变成了“我想，但我不存在”。\n\n简单来理解，现代社会的“我”，是由各色各样的第三方机构来定义的，如果他们否认“我”，那“我”就不存在。\n\n如果读者现在依然不太能理解这个过于哲学的话题，那么我可以换另一个与大家现实生活贴切的案例来举例。\n\n在疫情几年中，相信大家对核酸码、健康码已经非常熟悉了。那么在这个环境中大家可以很清晰地感知到绿码、黄码、红码机制对人们工作生活的影响。但健康码的颜色是根据身体是否感染新冠来变更吗？其实并不是。\n\n健康码的案例中，就是典型的由他人第三方机构来根据各种防疫政策来制定的。那么此时“我”的身份自身是无法证明的，需要第三方给“我”一个身份，“我”才能正常生活。\n\n点到即止，说回标题的去中心化身份（下文简称DID，Decentralized Identifiers）。去中心化身份的概念往上追溯，其实是隶属于数字身份下的一种。而数字身份早在互联网出现的上世纪九十年代就开始有相关的技术与概念，那么我将按照时间线，结合互联网资料给大家简单梳理一下数字身份的发展简史。\n\n自互联网诞生以来，数字身份已经发展了广义的四个阶段，分别是中心化身份、联盟身份、以用户为中心的身份和自我主权身份。\n\n**第一阶段：中心化身份**\n\n中心化身份是由单一的权威机构进行管理和控制的。中央集权化的机构，像是 1988 年成立的 IANA（Internet Assigned Number Authority，互联网号码分配局）管理着 国际互联网中使用的IP地址、域名和许多其他参数。到了 1998 年，ICANN（Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers，互联网名称与数字地址分配机构）成 立，接管了包括管理域名和 IP 地址的分配等与互联网相关的任务。\n\n到了 1995 年，证书颁发机构（CA，Certificate Authority），作为负责发放和管理数字证书的权威机构，以及在电子商务中受信任的第三方，承担公钥体系中对用户的公钥进行认证，从而验证用户的身份。\n\n如果说上世纪八九十年代的例子太久远，感知不强，那么可以参考2000年后的互联网浪潮。各类门户网站兴起，各家都需要注册账号，包括后面的博客、微博，这类账号都是中心化数字身份的一种具象化。\n\n随着互联网的发展，随着权力在等级制度中积累，另一个问题被揭示出来：身份越来越被碎片化。它们随着网站的增长而成倍增加，迫使用户在数十个不同的网站上处理数十种身份，同时无法控制其中任何一个。\n\n**第二阶段：联盟化身份**\n\n20 世纪末，数字身份的发展获得了重大进展。中心化身份导致的身份数据的混乱 而零碎等弊端，催生出了联盟身份这种由多个机构或联盟管理控制的身份体系。简单地 说，用户的在线身份数据具备了一定程度的可移植性，例如允许用户登录某个网站时， 可以使用其他网站的账户信息，类似于 QQ、微信或者微博的跨平台登录。\n\n微软于 1999 年推出的 Passport 计划，首次提出了“联盟身份”的概念和解决方 案。Passport 是一个由微软控制的中央式身份认证服务，提供了中央统筹式的单一登录服务，允许用户通过一次登录就可以获得访问很多网站的权限，但是，这使得微软成 为联盟的统筹中心，拥有极大的权力。\n\n联盟化的数字身份虽然一定程度上地解决了碎片化的问题，但是这样的数字身份依然是由单一的权威机构所掌控。在这个案例中是腾讯掌控。\n\n试想一下，你的微信号如果被封禁，那么很可能你微信钱包中的资产，微信登录的游戏资产，公众号的知识资产全都会被连带着被冻结。所以你的身份数据，依然不是你的身份数据，你只是作为使用者在使用第三方权威机构给你定义的身份数据而已。\n\n第三阶段：以用户为中心的身份\n\n2001年，Identity Commons 开始整合所有有关数字身份的工作，并将工作重点集 中在去中心化上，这也推动了 2005 年互联网身份工作组（IIW，Internet Identity Workshop）的创建。IIW 强调以用户为中心的身份，在创建在线身份的过程中，将用户 放在首要和中心的地位。\n\n以用户为中心的身份，希望实现的是用户通过授权和许可，可以决定身份的存储和使用以及将身份从一个服务共享到另一个服务。因此侧重于三个元素：用户的许可、 互操作性以及基于用户对数据的完全掌控。\n\n可惜，以用户为中心的身份计划并没有获得成功。以 OpenID 为例，用户理论上可以注册属于自己的 OpenID，但是由于技术门槛较高，普通的互联网用户更倾向于在一 个公共的并且相对可靠的网站上注册 OpenID 来登录到其他的网站。因此，用户注册的 OpenID 有着随时被网络提供商剥夺的风险，这意味着，用户并没有完全取得自己身份数据的掌控权。\n\n但是，在上述数字身份之后诞生的加密数字身份在Web3世界获得了前所未见的蓬勃发展。目前区块链常见的Web3钱包地址便是一种以用户为中心的数字身份。全球已经有数千万用户通过metamask来访问Web3网站，在上述的三个元素中已经实现了用户许可、互操作性。\n\n但是在用户对数据的完全掌控这一点上，由于区块链的一大特性就是数据完全公开透明，当前加密数字身份并不能实现对自身数据的完全掌控。目前也有很多链上数据分析工具针对巨鲸用户的地址研发出跟踪功能，这对于用户来说，数据的完全掌控依然是无从谈起的。\n\n第四阶段：自我主权身份\n\n自我主权身份是以用户为中心的身份的进阶阶段，二者的共同之处在于，都以用户完全掌控自己的身份数据为出发点，但自我主权身份更进一步，数据的收集、存储和使用都去中心化地分布在一个生态系统中，同时对于个人身份的验证，允许其他的普通 用户发表含有他人身份信息的声明（即下文将提到的“可验证声明”）。自我主权身份提供了三个必需的元素：单独控制、安全性和完全可移植性。它取消了上述三个阶段的集中外部控制。身份完全由个人(或组织)拥有、控制和管理。从这个意义上说，个人是 他们自己的身份提供者——没有外部的一方可以声称为他们“提供”身份，因为身份本质上是他们的。个人的数字存在是独立于任何单一组织的。\n\n在第三阶段，我将Web3钱包列为“以用户为中心的身份”，但是在第四阶段我依然拿Web3钱包作为案例。其中让Web3钱包从第三阶段跨度到第四阶段的核心功能，便是EVM。\n\n早在2017年，那时候处于公链大战的阶段，各家公链互不相同，无论是数据还是地址还是代币都是无法跨链流转的，是一个非常典型的数据孤岛。\n\n但是EVM的普及，诞生了一大批EVM兼容链，其中就包括BSC、AVAX、HECO等等。而EVM兼容链的蓬勃发展，也弥补上了在第三阶段中Web3钱包对可移植性的一大缺失。\n\n大家经常操作EVM兼容链时会发现，只要配置好了对应EVM兼容链的RPC，那么就可以用原先的以太坊地址去访问对应的EVM兼容链，这已经实现自我主权身份的所有基本要素。对整个区块链行业而言，EVM 可能比以太坊区块链本身更重要。\n\n*（数字身份发展部分内容来自时戳资本去中心化身份研究报告（2019），内容有所删减且加上个人观点。完整报告可在文末获取。）*\n\n**开源DID标准与Web3 DID发展方向**\n\n其实在现在，已经有两套开源且相对成熟的DID标准。分别是W3C DID标准与Decentralized Identity Foundation，即 DIF。\n\n其中W3C DID更类似定义标准，而DIF则是解决方案。其中的技术逻辑受限于我自身的知识面不够，所以并未深究。但是可以知道的是，市面上关于DID的Web3项目，其解决方案大多从这两套开源DID标准演变而来。\n\n那么现在探寻的Web3 DID方向已经不在于DID解决方案的技术如何优异，而是如何将这些DID解决方案落实在应用中。\n\n具体而言，包括POAP、RSS3、Project Galaxy、rabbithole等等项目，他们都是围绕着Web3加密身份衍生出的DID方向的应用。比如POAP、Project Galaxy、rabbithole通过分析用户的链上数据交互行为，来赋予各类身份认证或者徽章，这样的身份认证摆脱了第三方权威机构的单一控制，你一旦获取到了对应的身份，那么将会被区块链所永久存储并且可验证。\n\n而RSS3的项目目标是做 Web3 世界的 RSS 规范。项目愿景是让用户自己掌握内容的所有权和订阅权，并以不依赖中心化平台的方式进行内容聚合和呈现。RSS3 将用户创作的内容保存在Arweave上，在存储层面实现了去中心化，以及用户对内容的控制权。\n\n这些项目并不是大家所认为的在研发DID标准协议，更多的是基于现有以Metamask为首的Web3 DID来研发应用场景。切实地确保用户在Web3的加密身份验证、用户对内容的控制权领域上有真实的应用场景。\n\n当然，目前依然有很多项目在深耕DID的技术方案，以求在安全性、技术性上有更大的突破。但这可能会陷入到2017年公链战争中的场景中。虽然DID技术方案百家齐放，各有不同，但是互相却并不能兼容。而DID的可移植性反而才是重中之重，不能说我换一个Web3应用，我的DID身份就失效了。\n\n现在谈DID技术方案，我会将其类比为当年谈公链共识算法的差异化。但无论哪种技术方案，最终能绽放异彩的无疑是具体应用产品。\n\n那么在当下情况，基于EVM的Web3钱包账户体系，就是一个现阶段完美的DID框架。基于此，去实现更多用户真实可用的产品才是Web3 DID发展方向。绝大部分用户并不会使用或者研究DID的标准，但是他们可以直接使用到基于DID的应用。\n\nWeChat1：victeam005\n\nWeChat2：shijie20170405 \n

[당근마켓](https://www.daangn.com/)이 지금은 국민 앱이 됐지만, 우리가 처음 투자할 때는 트래픽이 별로 없었고, 초반에는 성장도 상당히 더뎠다. 시간이 가면서 입소문으로 앱이 바이럴하게 퍼졌지만, 그래도 내 주변에 당근마켓을 아는 사람은 거의 없었다. 그런데 어느 날 회사에서 퇴근하는 만원 버스 안에서 여기저기 밀리고 치여서 짜증이 살살 나고 있을 때, 뒤편에서 귀에 익은 깜찍한 소리가 들렸다. 바로 “당근\\~” 소리였는데, 아직도 그 순간이 기억난다. 아무도 몰랐던, 그리고 그 누구도 이렇게 성장하리라고 예측 못 했던 – 물론, 당시엔 지금 당근마켓의 성장은 상상도 못 했다 – 회사에 우리가 초기 투자를 하고, 그 서비스를 만원 퇴근 버스 안의 내가 모르는 그 누군가 사용하고 있다는 사실을 직접 경험한 그 순간은 정말로 마법과도 같은 순간이었다.\n\n[세탁특공대](https://www.getwashswat.com/)도 이와 비슷한 순간이 있었다. 나는 투자자라서 초반부터 열심히 세특을 애용했지만, 당시 우리 아파트 주민들은 대부분 동네 세탁소 또는 클린토피아를 사용하고 있었다. 엘리베이터 안에서 동네 세탁소 아저씨를 만날 때마다 속으로는 “빨리 모든 사람이 세탁특공대를 사용해야할텐데…언제 그렇게 될까”라고 생각했었다. 그런데 그 순간이 생각보다 빨리 왔다. 어느 날 너무나 낯익은 세탁특공대 유니폼을 입은 요원을 우리 아파트 정문에서 만났고, 혹시 몇 동 몇 호에 가시냐고 물어봤고, 우리 집이 아니라는 걸 확인했을 때, 마법과도 같은 순간이었다.\n\n청담도서관에서 어느 날 [플라이북](https://www.flybook.kr/)의 키오스크를 발견한 순간도 마법과도 같았다. 무에서 유를 만들고 싶어 하는 회사에 투자했는데, 정말로 대중이 사랑하고 내 눈앞에서 어린아이가 엄마의 손을 잡고 와서 플라이북 키오스크에서 추천해주는 책을 도서관에서 대여하면서 기뻐하는 그 모습을 보는 건, 마법과도 같다고 표현할 수밖에 없다.\n\n앞으로 이런 마법의 순간을 더 자주, 더 오래, 그리고 더 깊게 느꼈으면 좋겠다.", "timestamp": 1657247173, "digest": "cpDpfZwuk7pstv0NuveJlE53sZAt7QE7zni3jC35488", "contributor": "0xBc3427C8A5C9597B590a7A2BCE8b40bfcf0073fc"}
