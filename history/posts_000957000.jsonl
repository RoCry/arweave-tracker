{"id": "Xs6HdMzpXR0ykWJF3TxXKKRY5xeEq5hE_xYPPhGXGNw", "title": "Reflection on a new relationship between writers & readers in web3", "body": "I got into crypto in 2017 because my ex-boyfriend was an Ethereum miner. Out of curiosity, I started to step into this mysterious world to study, invest and run experiments (thanks ex!).\n\nWeb3 frens always say 2020 was the year of DeFi, 2021 was the year of NFTs and 2022 is the year of DAO. I went with a flow and dived deep into cryptocurrency, purchasing NFTs and participating in DAOs in my spare time.\n\nEarly in 2022, I discovered one of my favourite modern writers [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) was about to issue The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\*ck NFTs on the [BookCoin platform](https://www.bookcoin.com/). It made history for that was the first time a major bestseller to give an attempt in web3. By minting his [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\*ck NFTs](https://www.bookcoin.com/subtle-art), readers get access to an unreleased chapter, join his private Zero Fucks Club and attend Subtle Art School for free.\n\nIn a traditional world, there is always an invisible wall between readers and writers. Readers can purchase writers’ works or follow them on social media but rarely be able to prove their loyalty, engage with other readers on a large scale, interact with writers or participate in their creative process (don’t learn from [this episode](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14543418/?ref_=ttep_ep2) from Inside No.9!).\n\nLuckily enough, web3 gave readers a chance to form a central community to bond with like-minded fans and build relationships with their favourite content creators.\n\nIn Mark Manson’s club, I had the opportunity to ask him questions face to face (via zoom) and saw him actively appear on the private Discord channel to answer questions from readers.\n\nAs a content creator myself, I am running [a 100 True Fan experiment](https://cycircle.camelliayang.com/) by hosting an NFT-gated community where paid readers can get access to my private study notes, learn my creation process and have a 1:1 chat with me every month.\n\nWhat’s more, I have done some research in the web3 space on the future relationship between content creators and readers. Projects like [Story DAO](https://www.storydao.xyz/), [Fire Lily DAO](https://mirror.xyz/sitkaworld.eth/KckhO2AzEEomCGInMfVIwt7qvb1d9_wgo56VqFMVqJQ), [Story Quest at NFT NYC](https://twitter.com/StoryDAOxyz/status/1537151092034662400) and [Storyverse](https://storyverse.xyz/) empowered readers and community members to co-create or contribute to stories with established and emerging writers, and to co-own the story on the blockchain.\n\nRecently, I was at a [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/bookcoinHQ/status/1537142790643228674) run by BookCoin featuring [Sitka World](https://twitter.com/SitkaWorldNFT) to discuss #BookNFTs and opportunities for readers and [content creators in web3](https://mirror.xyz/sitkaworld.eth/KckhO2AzEEomCGInMfVIwt7qvb1d9_wgo56VqFMVqJQ). I love the vision shared by Sitka World founders that they want to become the go-to network for creative writers in web3. It also sparked my interests in the new way on co-creation and building a new relationship between readers and writers. My takeaways are:\n\n* Web3 will empower authors to skip the line of the gated traditional publishing world and truly own and distribute content with the help of the community.\n* BookNFT serves as a tool to make a real connection between authors and readers by offering exclusive incentives such as private community and unreleased content.\n* Fans get a chance to participate in authors’ creative process and gain royalty and can resell their stake in a project.\n\nPacky McCormick published an article on [“The Cooperation Economy”](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-cooperation-economy-). The core idea is a collection of like-minded people with like-minded goals can work together to make progress towards those goals beyond typical employment contracts (DAOs). People have the freedom to fluidly move between projects and organisations, contributing their skills wherever they fit.\n\nThe significant impact of this Cooperation Economy is on the publishing and media industries because their products and business models are relatively homogeneous. We are seeing many creators have already broken free from the traditional media and build their own brands and self-publishing/distribution channels based on technology and community support.\n\nWhile I was about to publish this article, I came across an exciting project [Bored & Dangerous](https://jenkinsthevalet.medium.com/how-were-bringing-web3-s-first-community-generative-novel-to-market-117c0596b82e) – the first novel set inside of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and it’s the first true novel that spun out of Web3. NFTs aren’t just expensive downloadable JPEGs but a hammer to smash the traditional content creation process and pave the way to a new era of human creativity.\n\nBAYC leveraged DAO structure, a new way of collaboration that brings together project financing, community management and value sharing. It empowers community members who are passionate about storytelling to co-create a novel and build the custom Web3 e-reader experience for members to interact with the book.\n\nWe are transitioning from an era of centralized, bureaucratic value-creating corporations to an era of decentralized, permissionless value-creating networks. There is no better timing than now to participate in the creator economy and form a niche community to generate values and achieve common goals.\n\nI’m on this journey and I’ll see y’all down the road!\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=295](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=295)\n\n", "timestamp": 1655561058, "digest": "SnfPD76IAlFeMCHc4BceRb875QZfO2oDxI0j4JAtBFo", "contributor": "0x6902E5CAf41158d3eD516cBd6D2807BB63863F42"}

Both these statements hold some truth, but only the latter statement can change.**\n\nThe word “investing” kills the appetite. It triggers images of a bore, a traditional suit, a bank, or a combination of the three. “Food” on the other hand, stimulates the senses. Just the thought of it can get you through a bad situation, and have you looking forward to a good one. In fact, our bodies actually release endorphins in anticipation of enjoying something salty or sweet, eliciting a chemical message well before the first bite. The second the aroma of fresh waffles enters your nose, the body derives satisfaction from the possibility that the actual waffles could enter your mouth. This phenomena exists as a part of what Charles Duhigg calls the “Cue, Routine, Reward” power of habits.\n\nFirst we encounter a cue - the lovely smell of fresh baked waffles. Next we enter the routine - walking over to the waffle cabin and making a purchase. Finally we get the reward. Biting in to something crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and smothered in molten chocolate. \n\nAll habits follow this pattern, and habit breaking involves changing the “routine”  component. Cues, like the temptation of a sweet snack, are not going anywhere. And our bodies are constantly seeking reward. The routine however can change, and the reward can be reimagined.\n\nA less fun habit exists whenever investing or finance comes up in discussion, but you don’t understand the topic. This has happened to me countless times and follows a familiar pattern.\n\nFirst we encounter a cue - someone brings up a foreign financial topic like “taking a long position in a SPYDR ETF”. Next we enter the routine - digging into our memory to try to rationalize, but ultimately misunderstanding the topic. Finally we get the reward. Putting the mind at ease by shifting the conversation to something we do understand. \n\nIn the following pages you will discover relatable food based associations for confusing financial topics - and will find yourself replacing the aforementioned routine of misunderstanding with a much more rewarding habit of knowing enough to engage in a meaningful conversation. ’SPYDR ETF’ will trigger a new routine, where ETF reminds you of a cold and refreshing smoothie, composed of an assortment of common stocks that are safe to eat and easy to find.

Not having it is.“\n\nThis adage from the wise shepherd of our generation, Kanye Omare West, rings true for the rich, the poor and everyone in between. People ask me all the time what they should invest in, likely because I work for a financial services company, or possibly because they listened to Kanye’s advice. Unfortunately for people, while I am a Registered Representive of a Broker Dealer (which means I can buy and sell financial products on behalf of investment managers and individuals), my expertise resides in designing and building financial trading platforms, and not in making stock recommendations. Additionally, Kanye is neither a Registered Representative nor a Certified Financial Planner. He made a salient point about achieving financial stability without pausing to provide a path to get there.\n\nFortunately, “Digestible Investing: A tasty guide to the world’s most important financial concepts and products” is that path.\n\nIt’s an encyclopedia of financial terms and defintions, crafted into an allegory of palatable proprotions, and fueled by almost 2 decades of learning about financial concepts. My path to financial independence started at 7 years old, when I asked my dad to explain the stock market. He told me it was a place where people bought and sold shares of publicly traded companies. I looked deep into his eyes, utterly confused, and returned to my practice of isolating the marshmellows from the oats in my bowl of lucky charms. Since then I have studied financial economics, worked as a financial services consultant, and passed the Series 7 in order to practice as a licensed Registered Representative. You could say I started from the bottom of my class in a notoriously wealthy Boston suburb. Since then I’ve drawn inspiration from iconic works of art, ranging from killer Kanye lyrics, to Anthony Bourdain’s satanic sarcasm in *Kitchen Confidential*, to Margot Robbie’s provactive précis on Mortgage Backed Securities in a bathtub during *The Wolf of Wall Street*, to John Updike’s fundamental foray into the lessons garned from a visit to the grocery store in *A&P*.  Now we’re here.

Each account provides different levels of preservation and protection of your money and products - kind of like the storage in your kitchen.\n\n \n \n\n**Kitchen Table / Checking and Savings Account**\n\nExtra cash in checking and savings accounts like food on your kitchen table. You’re not taking any precautions to preserve it because the food is ready for consumption.\n\n**Refrigerator / Brokerage Account**\n\nInvestments into individual products like stocks and bonds should be made into a brokerage account. Think of brokerage accounts like your refrigerator, which makes items accessible but is not the best place for long term storage. Items in a fridge, like investments in a brokerage account, are accessed and liquidated with relative frequency. \n\n**Pantry / IRA**\n\nThe pantry is for long term storage. Individual retirement accounts have limitations to the amount you can put in ($6K)- and are not intended for immediate withdrawal (59 1/2 or 10% penalty). They are tax deferred- meaning income earned can be put directly into the account without being taxed. Upon withdrawal taxes are applied based on your current tax bracket.\n\n**Freezer** / Roth IRA\n\nUnlike pantry items, frozen products can be precooked and ready to eat. Roth accounts are funded post-tax - but withdrawn tax free. William Roth was a senator from Delaware who passed legislation encouraging responsible saving. \n\n**Pantry at Work / 401K**\n\nLike the pantry at work- 401K’s store your products within a work account - and are often augmented or matched by your employer. In addition to whatever products you added to the pantry - your employer may also contribute various snacks accessible to you. Similar to a traditional IRA, a 401K is tax deferred, not eligible for withdrawal until retirement, and limited in contributions.\n\n**Freezer at Work / Roth 401K**\n\nLike the freezer at work- Roth 401K’s store your products within a work account - and can be pre-cooked (post-tax).\n\n**Emergency Food Storage / HSA**\n\nLike emergency foods, HSA’s last for a long time and maintain their value. HSA’s, or Health Savings Account, serve a similar purpose and do a great job preserving wealth. They are triple tax advantaged, meaning they are not taxed upon contribution or withdrawal, and interest and gains are not taxed either, assuming you use them to pay for healthcare.\n\n \n \n\nBefore investing in any of these accounts - you must set them up through an employer, bank or brokerage platform.", "timestamp": 1655562352, "digest": "yG7yxksRkXLiG-uCwozZ_NC10__0EjKi7WI2WtLrJK8", "contributor": "0x5ec0e9B3Be23dD29d915DBE02eD2924f677c15df"}

Stocks were first traded at a shipping port in Denmark - so wooden boats are fittingly linked to the terminology.\n\n \n \n\n**About the Product**\n\nStocks represent equity or shares issued by a company which provide partial ownership. The company’s worth is associated with the price of its shares, which means the shares can grow in value or plummet, depending on the company’s performance and demand for partial ownership. If the company goes bankrupt, the stockholders, as called shareholders, will receive money back only after all other financial obligations are met, including any outstanding debt payments.\n\n \n \n\n**Veggies / Bonds**\n\nLike veggies, bonds can be bland and predictable, and are typically consumed by the more responsible investors with an aversion to risk. However, some veggies can suprise, with bold flavors and substantial risk.\n\n \n \n\n**What’s in a Name?**\n\n“Bonds” reflect the binding nature of the investment product. Unlike a stock, which involves no financial commitments other than an ownership percentage (ignoring dilutions), bond issuers are obligated via a binding contract to pay bond holders the  agreed interest and principal amounts. \n\n \n \n\n**About the Product**\n\nBonds represent debt in the form of loans to an organization such as the government, a government agency, or a private company. If you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuing organization, and that org will pay you back over time, with interest. The payment typically involves a fixed interest rate, let’s say 5% of the overall price, every six months, which is why bonds are sometimes called “Fixed Income”. At maturity, which is like the product’s expiration date, the original amount paid for the product is returned to the holder as a principal payment.

Visuals are the most common example of this phenomena.\n\nMemory scientists once showed a slide show containing thousands of images to a class of students, flashing each image on the screen for a mere fraction of a second. The students were then shown a new slide show, this time mixing in new images with the ones they had already seen. When asked to identify whether an image was new or original, the students performed remarkably well, identifying well over 90% of the images correctly. This is because our brains capture visual information with unfathomable precision, mostly due to a reliance on understanding our surroundings in order to find food and survive.\n\nPeople that compete professionally in memory challenges begin with visual spaces, but engage all 5 senses. In order to memorize a string of numbers, they construct elaborate stories in their heads filled with sweet and pungent aromas, soothing and searing noises, soft and sharp edges, powerful visuals, and mouth watering tastes. The events are then strung together in their minds, and filled with lewd, inappropriate, and otherwise memorable backstories. In fact, one individual managed to memorize 70,000 digits of the number pi. They did this by creating sequential associations with sensory inducing imagery.\n\nThe task at hand pales in comparison to numerical recall, but the same principles of memory apply. Our memories actually depend on creativity to succeed. In practice, competitive memory techniques are relatively easy to implement. When you think about an association, like the aforementioned SPYDR ETF representing a diversified smoothie of stocks, don’t stop at the word smoothie. Imagine the burst of flavor on your tongue, the cold glass in your hand, and the beads of condensation running down the side. When you hear “ETF”, embrace the thought of the blender filled to the brim with a diverse stack of yellows, reds, and blues waiting to be pureed.\n\nWhile some people succeed with rote memorization, the consumption of information through repetition, this strategy lacks creativity and is extremely inefficient.

{"id": "Kkk-6bLJ72PwR1I_45EdPkxLCSR-BMzRH-QOa29i6Tk", "title": "Negotiating Post-Truth Epistemologies: Integrating Traditional and Critical Literacies in the General Paper Classroom", "body": "One of the first assignments I received as a student-teacher invited us to consider the need for contemporary educators to manage **traditional literacy** – that is, the basic ability to communicate with language – and new or emerging forms of literacies (e.g. **digital literacy**, **critical information literacy**, etc.) within the reality of time-poor classrooms comprising students with diverse learning profiles and needs. Here is the reflection question posed to us:\n\n> ### 💡 Reflection Question:\n>\n> How do we reconcile the need to address both traditional literacy and other forms of literacies in one curricular framework — especially given the limitations of time, class size, and examination demands?\n\nThe remainder of this post provides a sketch of my response to that question.\n\n## Teaching Critical Information Literacy\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, there would need to be space intentionally carved out for lessons and discussions about critical information literacy in the classroom. This should not be seen as a trade-off or a hassle. Having a firm grasp of critical information literacy and consequently being able to demonstrate **[epistemic virtues](https://amzn.to/3NTvQLu)**[ like sincerity and accuracy](https://amzn.to/3NTvQLu) is a necessary condition for students to craft cogent and compelling arguments.\n\nFortunately for General Paper (GP) teachers, this deliberate pedagogical decision is complementary to several central guiding tenets outlined in the GP Teaching and Learning Syllabus 2022, namely:\n\n* the teaching of \"critical and inventive thinking skills through sound reasoning and the formulation of informed and insightful personal responses\" (p. 7), and\n* the development of our students' disposition to have \"a questioning mind towards information, ideas, and issues\" (ibid.).\n\nPut bluntly, time spent on the explicit instruction of critical information literacy in the GP classroom is not time wasted. Rather, it is a crucial – though oftentimes underemphasised – part of the curriculum.\n\nIn practice, explicit and applied lessons in critical literacy could include:\n\n* explicit teaching and discussions of the **[theories](https://amzn.to/3aWeqiI)**[ of digital literacy and critical literacy](https://amzn.to/3aWeqiI),\n* in-class discussions of the **credibility** and **potential biases** of news articles or media artefacts that students bring in,\n* classroom **debates** about topics in line with student interests,\n* source analysis and discussions of **[motivations](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/10/19/the-future-of-truth-and-misinformation-online/)**[ and ](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/10/19/the-future-of-truth-and-misinformation-online/)**[incentive structures](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/10/19/the-future-of-truth-and-misinformation-online/)**[ for content producers and distributors](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/10/19/the-future-of-truth-and-misinformation-online/), and so on.\n\nIncidentally, elements of traditional literacy (including, but not limited to: accuracy in basic grammar and spelling, appropriate tone, academic integrity, appreciation and acknowledgment of audience and context, the knowledge of logical and argumentative fallacies¹, etc.) could also be easily weaved into the activities enumerated above.\n\nFor instance, students could learn – through either deductive or inductive teaching approaches – the importance of academic integrity and how to use the appropriate tone when engaging with dissenting views when they prepare for and participate in classroom debates. **Standards of permissible evidence** as well as **[rules of engagement in debates](https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/)** can (and should) be established before students embark on such learning experiences.\n\nWhat I am suggesting, therefore, is an *integration* of traditional literacies with critical information literacy rather than a mere *reconciliation* (if, by 'reconciliation', we mean making compromises). Such integration is especially pressing in a [post-truth environment](https://amzn.to/3Oj5geP) where orthodox epistemologies are being subverted and called into question. Students need to be exposed to ways to negotiate complexity and uncertainty and be comfortable with not-knowing.\n\nA further corollary (if we take the teaching of critical information literacy seriously) is that teachers need to keep abreast of contemporary research and developments in post-truth epistemology to be aptly primed to conduct these discussions about critical information literacy. **To be sure, we don't need to become experts**; an understanding of the context and purposes of these theories and frameworks would suffice – at least for now.\n\n## Other forms of literacies\n\nOur students are right: it is an unfortunate reality that schools don't seem to teach them the *really* important things in life, like how to file taxes, how to manage relationships, or how to be content. Whether or not this reality is justified, however, depends on which **social function of education** we think assumes (or deserves) primacy: social stratification, facilitating self-actualisation, promoting innovation, or something else altogether.\n\nThat debate aside, it remains that [many other kinds of literacies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332875093_Types_of_Literacy) are often overlooked, if not ignored, in schools. I do not have an answer as to how to resolve this problem. The best I can come up with is to point students to resources about social and financial literacy in the hopes that they discover just how important they are.\n\nSome may insist that niche categories like financial literacy fall outside the purview of the education system. Those who sympathise with this view are likely to already have clear and well-defined ideas of what the function of the education system is. While this may be a perfectly reasonable and consistent perspective to hold, things may change, and quickly at that.\n\nThe disruption of traditional epistemologies seems to have been driven primarily by developments in **Web2**, where we have been empowered to become content producers as well as consumers.\n\nWith the barriers to entry of content production virtually removed, **new problems in social epistemology** emerged: Who do we count as domain experts and how reliable do they need to be? What notion(s) of \"reliability\" should we invoke? How do we evaluate the credibility of information? What is the difference between misinformation and disinformation? Should information be regulated on social media, and who should provide such regulations? Do retweets and likes count as implicit/explicit endorsements?\n\nThese discussions have invariably found their way into classroom debates about critical information literacy. Therefore, it is clear that **paradigm shifts in how we organise our communication and coordination infrastructures** will have a clear and direct impact on *what* and *how* we teach our students when it comes to literacy.\n\nWhat happens, then, when we become consumers, producers, and **owners** of content? While Web3 may only be in its nascent stages, it bears considering the impact of content ownership on critical information literacy and education in general.\n\nIn particular, when financial value becomes inextricably tied to our communication infrastructures, what novel epistemological challenges are likely to emerge? How would we then evaluate the importance of financial literacy in our curriculum? What are the various problems associated with **knowledge, proof, and truth** in [the disparate and ever-growing consensus mechanisms that are developing in the blockchain industry](https://www.blockchance.eu/consensus-mechanisms/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=consensus-mechanisms)? Can digital identities and [soul-bound](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) tokens be apt replacements for accreditation?\n\nWeb3 seems to be an inevitability rather than a distant counterfactual. Further exploration into these avenues may prove to be fruitful and instructive for educators – and that is precisely what I'm setting out to do in this space. I hope you join me on this journey.\n\n\n_____________________\n\n**Notes**\n\n¹ *The success of the last integration seems to be largely contingent on the teacher’s confidence and familiarity with those argumentative fallacies in the first place. Furthermore, there are teachers who believe that students' knowledge of these fallacies does **not** necessarily translate into better student writing. I have no strong intuitions when it comes to this, though I suspect that making resources related to argumentation available to all students may be helpful.*\n\nFeatured image by [Josh Massey](https://unsplash.com/@joshuamphotography?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/thought?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText).", "timestamp": 1655562100, "digest": "XsV9q8NmZKHzNZKGRXGW0vozO1zWEP1zccyjwvkHjd0", "contributor": "0x789ce89b9385baA24395427807B190169149Da39"}

You pay a premium for this service, sometimes up to 3% of the assets under management (the amount of money you give them to invest). Despite the premium, there is no guarantee that an advisor will choose the best products and grow your money the most, just like there is no guarantee that a meal at a restaurant will be better than something you can cook at home.\n\nFinancial advisors may make sense for people with a lot of money to invest but little time to understand investing, or little capacity to invest unemotionally. Advisors are also able to align product selection with an investor’s goals, and to help investors take advantage of tax laws.\n\n**Meal Kits and Grocery Delivery / Roboadvisor**\n\nLike a meal kit or grocery delivery app, roboadvisors can select products for you in exchange for a small fee. You will need to input some information, such as the general type of product you are looking for, age, risk tolerance, etc., while the app will take care of sourcing and buying investments into your portfolio. Despite the lack of human involvement, roboadvisors can make sophisticated and personalized investment decisions, and even help with tax loss harvesting (smart recycling).\n\nRoboadvisors can benefit any investor- especially those with a medium or low net worth that can’t afford a financial advisor and don’t have time to develop an investment strategy on their own. \n\n**Old Fashioned Home Cooking / Investing directly on a brokerage platform**\n\nLike buying your own groceries, DIY investing involves doing all of your own research and executing trades directly. Most brokerage platforms now offer free trading, which makes home cooking the cheapest way to buy and sell investment products. They offer other advantages as well, such as fractional share trading, which is akin to pricing by weight, rather than by whole products- allowing customers to purchase only what they need.\n\n**Free Samples / Sign Up Deals**\n\nLike free samples at the grocery store, financial advisors, roboadvisors, and brokerage platforms are all competing for your dollars, and will offer incentives to make this happen. They may offer $5 free just for creating an account, or $500 if you create an account and deposit $10,000. Some will focus on referalls, offering you $25 if you get your friends to join the platform. Sites like nerdwallet often publish articles highlighting the best deals at the time.", "timestamp": 1655562380, "digest": "RJ78_0ttfxlHUHzLV1cxdj17A5eFiwGjo4TldbgUsHE", "contributor": "0x5ec0e9B3Be23dD29d915DBE02eD2924f677c15df"}
{"id": "RtMBBQxh94cRiQnZWT4VBIlV-u4UyyA98jkPXtPS758", "title": "🔥 Cooking with Gas", "body": "**TL,DR: By harnessing our memories of food, we can quickly and enjoyably recall relevant financial concepts.**\n\nOur brains can store an almost infinite amount of information when that information activates our senses. Visuals are the most common example of this phenomena.\n\nMemory scientists once showed a slide show containing thousands of images to a class of students, flashing each image on the screen for a mere fraction of a second. The students were then shown a new slide show, this time mixing in new images with the ones they had already seen. When asked to identify whether an image was new or original, the students performed remarkably well, identifying well over 90% of the images correctly. This is because our brains capture visual information with unfathomable precision, mostly due to a reliance on understanding our surroundings in order to find food and survive.\n\nPeople that compete professionally in memory challenges begin with visual spaces, but engage all 5 senses. In order to memorize a string of numbers, they construct elaborate stories in their heads filled with sweet and pungent aromas, soothing and searing noises, soft and sharp edges, powerful visuals, and mouth watering tastes. The events are then strung together in their minds, and filled with lewd, inappropriate, and otherwise memorable backstories. In fact, one individual managed to memorize 70,000 digits of the number pi. They did this by creating sequential associations with sensory inducing imagery.\n\nThe task at hand pales in comparison to numerical recall, but the same principles of memory apply. Our memories actually depend on creativity to succeed. In practice, competitive memory techniques are relatively easy to implement. When you think about an association, like the aforementioned SPYDR ETF representing a diversified smoothie of stocks, don’t stop at the word smoothie. Imagine the burst of flavor on your tongue, the cold glass in your hand, and the beads of condensation running down the side. When you hear “ETF”, embrace the thought of the blender filled to the brim with a diverse stack of yellows, reds, and blues waiting to be pureed.\n\nWhile some people succeed with rote memorization, the consumption of information through repetition, this strategy lacks creativity and is extremely inefficient. Whether you are a student or working professional, your time is limited. If you know you are interested in mutual funds, skip everything else and jump immediately to the page featuring refreshing fruit salads. The book is an encyclopedia, not a novel. We’re cooking with gas and our goal is to waste as little time as possible.", "timestamp": 1655562120, "digest": "3e2gLE4BzhpipUVD_rW6LA48uC69KlOHGbYQqZVEmQU", "contributor": "0x5ec0e9B3Be23dD29d915DBE02eD2924f677c15df"}

{"id": "zTwSYUgOkSzd51NcM59yqGSV-zKp1aBGwH3g1kJ3Iyc", "title": "♻ Taking Out the Trash", "body": "**TL,DR: Every investment decision has tax implications. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.**\n\nWhether it’s a pit, packaging, or scraps, consuming food products creates food waste. Financial products create a byproduct as well. Without careful planning, that byproduct can be investment penalties or a high tax bill. With planning, it can be a low tax bill, or even a rebate. \n\n \n \n\n**Garbage / Capital Gains Tax**\n\nDisposing of garbage is not free. Capital gains are not free either, however there are ways to reduce tax liability. Short term investments, which are held for less than 1 year, are taxed as normal income - meaning the highest earners could pay up to 37% percent in taxes\\*. Long term investments, held for 1 year or longer, are taxed more favorably, at 20%, or at the individuals income tax rate, whichever is lower.\n\n \n \n\n**Recycling / Tax Deductions & Tax Loss Harvesting**\n\nReturning bottles and cans at 5 cents a pop can really add up. So can tax deductions. With a capital loss, investors can lower their taxable income by up to $3,000 each year, and these losses carry forward. If you sold a stock for $15,000 less than you bought it for, you can take a $3,000 deduction every year for the next 5 years (15,000/3,000 = 5). Like a grocery store limiting the number of bottles you can return per trip, the IRS (internal revenue service in charge of collecting taxes) limits yearly losses.\n\nTaxable income is the amount of money you made in a year subject of federal, state, and local taxes. In the example above, your taxable income might be $50,000 /year. After the deduction, your taxable income has been reduced to $47,000. A 10% tax bill will be $4,700 instead of $5,700. $300 may not seem like a lot, but like a pile of 5 cent cans, these deductions can really add up.\n\nTax loss harvesting involves selling stocks for a loss to balance out gains, and helps investors take advantage of the tax code.\n\n \n \n\n**Compost / Charitable Rebates**\n\nLike composting, charitable giving and charitable rebates benefits the planet and it’s inhabitants by putting excess too good use. Like a capital loss, charitable donations can be deducted from 25-100% of an individuals taxable income, and up to 25% of a corporations taxable income. The individual deduction only applies when you itemize your deductions - a process when filing taxes that involves specifying unique actions and situations that qualify for tax rebates. Let’s say your taxable income is $100,000 and your tax bracket demands a 30% tax rate. Instead of paying the government $30,000, you could donate up to $18,000 to a charity of your choice, and owe the government just $12,000.", "timestamp": 1655562419, "digest": "-StgYSRX2bycoDzgQV4TIMTch_GV3bP6BWajGP4Bw0I", "contributor": "0x5ec0e9B3Be23dD29d915DBE02eD2924f677c15df"}

{"id": "mu1OsTo5qz_YuYmZynCaYEgxi32D3g_KteoRlhFN2D0", "title": "Entering the Everywhere", "body": "Welcome! I’ve read bunch of articles on Mirror, but never really thought of joining and posting. But hey, since I am in crypto/blockchain/web3 with all I have (and I don’t mean money, I mean brain power), I can as well start using the tools I preach and believe in.\n\nSo where is this “everywhere”? Well, look around you. We live in interconnected world - cars, businesses, your friends. They are all part of the large metaverse. I don’t mean a VR world, I mean your social networks, professional networks. You are looking into metaverse through a small (or larger) screen of the device in front of you.\n\nI am just joining a specific part of this metaverse. The one that is trying to take it further, but also make it more fair and engaging.\n\n## How did I get here?\n\nThat is a very good question! I’ve been at the front of new technologies for a while.\n\nI was there when [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) became a thing.\n\nI was there when [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) brought Linux containers to masses.\n\nI was there when the new shiny object called [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) moved from bleeding edge to de facto standard.\n\nAnd now I am here - looking at our virtual lives changing (once again?).\n\nI’ve spent las 10 years building open source software at Red Hat. And I loved it for the most part - if you ask me about how do I feel about Red Hat these days, I’ll talk about it as excited as ever.\n\nBut as you can guess, I am no longer at Red Hat. “Why?” you may ask.\n\nThe answer is simple, yet complex, as everything in our lives. I left Red Hat because I really really wanted to dig deeper into what web3 really means. And I was also bored. I worked on an AI platform. As cool as it sounds, I am not a big fan of AI. Not in the sense most people think about it and use it. I think a lot of the hype ends up being “over promise and under deliver”, rather than useful and helpful.\n\nBut wait, you are now in the biggest scam and ponzi of the lifetime, ain’t ya?\n\n## What is web3?\n\nI don’t know. I kinda know how it is percieved and I definitely know what I would like it to be.\n\nThe perception seems to be that it is full of scams (which I agree with) and that there is not one single project that is doing something useful (which I disagree with).\n\nWhat I’d like it to be is a place where smart people come together and try to solve real world problems using bleeding edge technologies.\n\nSome will immediately point out that public ledger is not that bleeding edge, but I’ll say that the way it is operated and used with blockchain and in web3, it is rather innovative.\n\n## What would I like web3 to be?\n\nI’ve read a lot about what we could build using the new paradigms. The best 2 things I’ve seen recently are [Hyperstructures](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) and this [blurb about someone joining a16z](https://mirror.xyz/jozhu.eth/xs0zkDvHIW89t0qM84_-SdNGSVTqTa0a8hhgOKvOpuc) (no disrespect, I just never heard of that person, but following closely now).\n\nThe authors basically say the same thing on different levels of abstraction from the technology. But the message stays - web3 gives us the opportunity to cut the profits of intermediaries and leave them in the hands of users.\n\nThis is hard. Everyone wants to make money. Making money is the game of life.\n\nMoney is our score. There is no more generally accepted leader board than how much money you’ve made.\n\nI am also here to make money. We all are. Well, I guess almost all of us, but I think I can generalise here.\n\nBut the way money is made and the amounts staying in the hands of few versus the hands of many is the difference. And web3 hopes and promises to be better at the money distribution.\n\nObviously, with currently ongoing crash, we can safely say, we are not there yet. This market crash did show one thing very well - greed always gets the best out of us.\n\nEven I am to blame - I could have made so much money to fund so many cool things, hadn’t I been greedy.\n\nBut we are all learning and we keep playing the money game - as individuals and as organizations.\n\n## Enough! What do I want to build?\n\nI would love to build something on the principles of Hyperstructure - an open protocol that allows anyone to use it. The protocol that actually adds value - not just extract it from the users to deliver it to owners or other users. The protocol that can be sustained and extended by the users.\n\nHow? I have my thoughts, but it is not gonna be one man show and we are still early. And also, I have so much to learn to be able to even assess if I am doing it right.\n\nI’ll do my best to keep you up to date on what I’ve learnt and what I am building.\n\nWe are at the beginning - of a new journey, a bear market, a shift in the perception of web3. I like new beginnings. I really like things that I don’t understand, cause that means there is still a lot to learn and explore.\n\nI really really like the web3 space.\n\nStay safe my virtual friends. Keep your private keys and seed phrases secure. Do not trust blindly.\n\nIt is the wild west and you need to be on look out for all the frauds. But also try to stay open minded and see if some of these things may help in the longrun.", "timestamp": 1655562884, "digest": "ULG6yHzd2buiuz06aOO6sclVCvWpzcWXXLB8EFbtAiA", "contributor": "0x1D45c8fa65F6b18E7dAe04b2efEa332c55696DaA"}
