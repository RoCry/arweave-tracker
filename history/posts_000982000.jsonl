By that point, the film had already eclipsed one billion dollars at the box office, including the first ever $100 million dollar opening weekend for star and super-producer Tom Cruise - a fact that gets more astonishing the longer you think about it.**\n\nI had heard all the project buzz, well-seeded by the press team into the general mediascape: the revolutionary filming techniques; the bootcamp Cruise put his junior castmates through to meet his stunt standards; and the defiance of contemporary Hollywood business practice by both eschewing direct-to-streaming and by refusing to cater to Chinese censorship norms. The word of mouth in my world had been good but not earth shattering. While it was my intent all along to see the film in theaters, it was ultimately the combination of a hot day and aimless time spent with my friend Malthe that compelled us to attend a matinee viewing in the icy confines of the Windsor Terrace Nite Hawk.\n\nTo call the movie good and leave it there would be to sell the experience short in no less than half a dozen ways. Simple superlatives do not explain a film experience as this, rendered with such singular confidence. It has all the potential to be a sea change in how we understand American filmmaking, the still-principal cultural medium in a country whose primary export is culture.\n\nIt exists in a rare pantheon of films: sequels that are strict upgrades to their predecessors, and even within that club may have no peer due to the unique opportunities the time between productions afforded it. And above all else, it is the masterstroke of a man whose dedicated his life to movie magic, such that he himself is both an unplumbable illusion and a vessel of self-assurance, capable of leveraging his oeuvre, clout, and historical circumstance to lead a film team in the production of a movie where he alternates not roles, but avatars: Maverick, Boomer, White Man, and, at times, America itself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe movie begins universally across screenings with the nearly unthinkable: a fourth-wall break from a weathered yet glowing Cruise. With this brief, thirty second look behind the curtain, the stakes of the film are raised exponentially. It postures Cruise in a moment of vulnerability - a feint, of course, as he is functionally incapable of the control concessions necessary for vulnerability, but the effect is nonetheless achieved.\n\nHere we have him exhibiting more age than we’ll see in the subsequent feature, talking directly with the audience about once again celebrating the cinematic experience - his entire reason for being - in the wake of a centennial pandemic. This is a movie star pushing his entire reputation into the center of the table for ideas bigger than himself, some apparent in the moment and others evident as the film plays out. It’s a level of assuredness that underwrites the entire experience to follow, itself a story about the supreme confidence of men and women so trained in technical excellence and national values that they can feel their way to achievements beyond rational limits.\n\nIt’s the movie craft equivalent of a cantrip, yet over and over in message boards and comment sections, this simple intro is called out as relatable and meaningful to the audience’s viewing experience. The message is clear: Tom Cruise would like us to help him save Cinema.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Top Gun: Maverick* is unambiguously an American propaganda film. This is a genre deeply entrenched in the nation’s cinematic DNA, dating all the way back to the first Oscar winner for best picture, 1927’s *Wings*, itself a collaboration with the United States Army Air Corps.\n\nThis is not to say *Top Gun: Maverick* deals in heavy handed symbolism or grandstanding. Another way to describe it would be a celebration of national values, yet this is too permissive in the other direction. What audiences are presented in the 2:11 runtime is a new way to look at America’s standing in the world in relation to the elephant pointedly *not* in the room, China.\n\nGone are the tropes we’re used to in most American military propaganda films. There’s no liberation or freedom motive. Terrorism prevention is the mission conceit, but the threat is consistently matter of fact, emotionless, and hidden behind visors when finally encountered. Most interestingly, technological superiority is not ensured, as the mission parameters call for outmoded F-18’s to outduel “fifth generation” enemy fighter planes.\n\nWhat takes the place of these standards? A collection of American ideals well-suited to foil contemporary totalitarianism. Embodying America’s conscience, Cruise imprints upon superior officer John Hamm the equal importance of government motive and pilot lives. Time and again, the *individual* is identified as the difference maker, not the machine. And perhaps most surprisingly, diversity of sex and race among our heroes is both prominent and deftly handled, causing a different type of American pride to well up after decades of hard fought, fractious, yet crucial culture wars. When dealing with rivals at a global stage that are actively homogenizing their populace through reeducation and genocide, this matters.\n\nTotal credit to the Top Gun team - with special callouts for Cinematographer Claudio Miranda and Director Joseph Kosinski - for managing to strike a synthesis of modern values and national propaganda. If ever there were a time to aim for a common ground boost to a nation’s morale, this is it, coming off a generational catastrophe that typically would create a “rally around the flag” effect, but instead pressed the political climate further toward acrimony and totalitarian flirtings. It’s these types of gestures that will need to happen across various spheres of life, not just the political arena, for America to start thinking again as one nation and not a collection of battleground states. It is not surprising that the first meaningful step towards this goal comes from the popcorn movie industry, whose weekly box office numbers are reported in the same news segment as the Dow Jones and sports scores.\n\nAll this said, there remains the ever present danger inherent to all works of propaganda: unquestioned certitude. There exists not a stitch of moral ambiguity or indecisiveness in this film, from its screenplay up to its star. This is masterfully masked by the elite Hollywood craftsmanship, burnished to the point where the audience will agree with any logic and view any caricature in the most charitable light.\n\nStarting at the most liminal level, war is treated as a granted necessity. And of course it is, as we wouldn’t have a film without it. But the concept of the United States unilaterally, preemptively, and clandestinely bombing a rogue state 3 weeks before it violates a multilateral NATO treaty is as farfetched as it is disturbing for any viewer stopping to grok the logic. Any attempt to suss out the reasoning outside the film’s working parameters instantly imperils the thinker ethically: “America does this all the time,” ”War is the price of safety,” ”They were asking for it.”\n\nAs far as *Top Gun: Maverick* is concerned, failure to address these questions is a feature, not a flaw. Tackling America’s deep-seeded love for military might captured on film is for another day and project. In order to hit the thematic heights it’s aiming for, an unblemished runway is required for any chance of success. And what better chance to achieve liftoff velocity than John Hamm and Tom Cruise trading military bluster over the slickest mission briefing UI the navy has ever seen.\n\nChipping in at times during the briefing is Charles Parnell, admirably performing the role of Solomon ‘Warlock’ Bates. He serves as the administrative release valve for Cruise’s Maverick, validating his unorthodox practices and allowing the audience to see levity in Maverick’s otherwise insubordinate acts. Here again the film pressed forward with mach-speed confidence, caught between America’s contemporary diversity ideals - i.e., establishing a Black man in a position of authority - and Cruise’s superstar gravity, which renders every character he comes into contact with as supplicant to his will. The same effect can be felt with Bashir Salahuddin’s character “Hondo,” who violates orders on Maverick’s behalf and follows him to his new post to serve as his airplane caddy. While these interactions are again navigated well given the non-stop certitude the film requires to stay airborne, it inexorably positions Cruise as a white man that can do no wrong.\n\nAt the start of the final act, just as Cruise has assumed control as mission leader in defiance of age and military orthodoxy, Warlock stops him for a moment alone. He earnestly confides, “Captain Mitchell, you’re where you belong. Make us proud.” The subtext of this is just narrowly subdued by the feeling of comradery between the two characters.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWere it restricted to the ranks of officer relations, this portrait of Cruise as an avatar of whiteness might not seem as salient. When moving towards the romantic component of the film, however, the comparison becomes unavoidable. Credit first to the film team for yet again incorporating contemporary ideals of courtship into the film’s unflinching perspective. The romance logic of the first film can charitably be described as a relic of a bygone era and fairly described as a contributing factor to decades worth of sexual consent issues America still grapples with today.\n\nIn comparison, *Top Gun: Maverick* unfurls an old flame relationship between Cruise and kindred 80’s icon Jennifer Connelly that feels balanced in power and grounded in life experience. Kudos too for what was not pursued, namely any hints of a relationship between Lt. Natasha “Phoenix” Trace - played flawlessly by Monica Barbaro - and any of her squad mates.\n\nThe screen time shared between “Pete” (Cruise) and “Penny” (Connelly) represents Maverick’s downtime, playfulness, and relatability. Any intrusion to the atmosphere of pure leisure is related to Cruise’s work struggles and the mysterious theme of “letting go”. It’s telling, therefore, that each locale and set-up feels archetypically white. There’s the Jimmy Buffet beach bar owned by Penny, whose soundtrack alternates between Classic Rock jukebox tracks and spontaneous singalongs to Jerry Lee Lewis’ “Great Balls of Fire”. A second date yacht excursion finds Penny teaching Pete to sail while dressed in immaculate J. Crew attire. And in the off hours, we retreat to Penny’s idyllic bungalow on a hill, just as easily at home in Cape Cod were it not for the palm trees.\n\nRecent decades of the ongoing dialogue around race in America have focused the conversation around whiteness as access for societal navigation. At the same time, there’s an understandable urge to compare whiteness to Blackness, which in contrast is a true culture born of hardship and galvanized by perseverance. Finding consumer access naturally a cultural non-starter, the search for comparable white identity has pushed some searchers down dark paths, leading to Confederate flags in Northern strongholds and Nazi rallies on capital lawns.\n\nAnd yet here in *Top Gun: Maverick* we see a third option, one rendered routinely in times past but impossible to show generously in today’s age without that killer instinct confidence. It is that of the White Anglo Saxon Protestant, the American royalty, unattainable yet aspirational in the land of hard work of dreams.\n\nRightfully rejected in the real world for its detachment from reality, it’s a taste of sun-dipped heaven and infinite leisure that marks America’s cultural understanding of what successfully planned golden years might look like. Only a megawatt star in an expertly rendered propaganda film with an audience begging for normalcy could possibly pull it off. But Cruise is exactly that star, and a big subset of that audience - Baby Boomers - is betting their whole mortality on it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCruise himself is just inside the generational cusp, having turned sixty the July 3rd after release. This is even better for those pinning their escapism to him, as he’s the youngest, spryest version of the class.\n\nIn the film, Maverick is set up to be the mentor figure, the teacher to the next generation of Top Gun pilots. At every turn he resists while the powers in charge hammer home that he has to “let go”, that his age is over and a new age is arriving.\n\nAnd yet, he doesn’t have to let go. At all. At least when it comes to the idea that the flight game is passing him by. In one of the most satisfying segments, Cruise introduces himself to his new class by squaring off against them in a series of dogfighting exercises, with losers sentenced to 200 tarmac pushups. Time and again, Cruise displays his veteran wiles and supernaturally undiminished reflexes, all punctuated by the choicest cuts of The Who’s “Won’t Get Fooled Again.” As each young gun falls and the push-up totals mount, the aura of invincibility and moral certainty around Cruise is secured for the remainder of the film.\n\nThe message to the Boomer-era audience is clear: we ain’t dead yet. And the rest of the audience gleefully falls in line, as Cruise and his electric persona can flatten all nuance and for them be the connection to an America that perpetually exists in the past, free of ambiguity and brimming with values we all can agree on.\n\nThe only question in the film left is whether or not this national and generational relic can survive one “final'' mission. The movie posits this question masterfully, as Maverick states in his mission assessment that “someone isn’t coming back from this one.” It’s that simple logic conflict of Cruise’s utter certitude and undefeated skill that keeps the fate of these porcelain precious concepts teetering over uncertainty for longer than most stories of its ilk.\n\nWhen - spoiler alert - the final verdict does come in, the production once again delivers with masterful execution. Maverick sacrifices himself for his wingman Rooster (Bradley Bradshaw), surrogate son and actual son of his deceased wingman from the previous film, Goose. Chaos and confusion set in, and the remaining squad members are called back to the carriers for safety. There’s a fade to black that could plausibly return us to the mainland and an honorable funeral, until with great relief the camera returns to Maverick, untangling himself from parachute gear and wondering what to do next.\n\nAt this point, the greatest trick in the film’s arsenal is revealed to the audience. Rooster naturally saves Maverick’s life and the pair are stuck behind enemy lines with no plan in mind. It is here that a great dawning collectively appears to every single theater goer.\n\n“Holy shit, we’re in a spy film now.”\n\nThe combination of Maverick’s unquestioned skillset and Cruise’s unbeatable movie resume allow him to summon *Mission Impossible’s* Ethan Hunt in an instant. The two infiltrate the enemy airbase, steal a jet and take off from a missile-pocked runway against impossible odds. The fact that they’re now tasked with fighting their way home against superior aircraft in an enemy F-14 - The plane used in the original *Top Gun* - takes those national and generational narratives and triples down.\n\nBut by now victory is a foregone conclusion. The audience can enjoy every thrill on the way back to the carrier safely knowing each intervention will favor our heroes. When hotshot pilot Hangman - spiritual torch bearer to the masculine urgency of the first film, played pitch perfect by Glen Powell - delivers the pair from certain death at the last instant, all accounts are settled and we’re ready for the celebratory, carrier deck mosh pit.\n\nIn the film’s final moments, as Rooster and Maverick work lovingly on a plane together, Penny drives up to the hanger in a 1973 Porshe 911 S to seal the romantic loose ends. It might as well be B-roll from the greatest Viagra commercial ever made, but as they literally fly off into the sunset in Cruise’s own P-51 Mustang, all is right and golden.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAll of this is far from the most impactful moment of the film. That would occur roughly somewhere in the middle, as Maverick pays a visit to his old friend from the original film Iceman (Val Kilmer). In the intervening decades, Iceman has climbed the naval ranks while Maverick has stayed as a Captain. Maverick’s high placed friend has saved him from career ruin on many occasions, ultimately bringing him back to Top Gun for the “final” mission.\n\nThe scene is most obviously affecting due to Kilmer’s real life struggle with throat cancer and its residual effects. Robbed of speech, Iceman communicates via prompts typed on a computer. The moment is fashioned as a therapy session, and it's here that Maverick, Boomer, White Man and American Tom Cruise gets the closest he may ever get to revealing his essence.\n\n“It’s time to let go,” writes Kilmer, fully wielding the authority of mortality.\n\n“I don’t know how,” replies Cruise tearfully. And in that one moment, all truths align for both the film and the entire Tom Cruise spectacle. He clarifies further still, stating that being Maverick is not “who I am, it’s what I am.”\n\nHere we are at the knife’s edge of Tom Cruise’s entire identity - sparkling diamond vessel suited only for pure archetype. Witnessing this moment as an audience member, I dared dream we might actually see it: a world where Tom Cruise relents, placing his helmet aside and joining the realm of the mortals, where identities are fixed but at least they’re your own.\n\nOf course this could never happen, not now for Cruise and certainly not for the film’s logic. Like a captive whale pressed tight against the glass, slowly he recedes to the aquarium’s shadows, relating “letting go” to the structurally sound yet emotionally innocuous paternal angle: moving out of Rooster’s way and letting him become a true pilot like his real father.\n\nAnd even in that, the film lets Cruise and all his adherents have their cake and eat it too. He leads the mission out of all the young guns after stealing an aircraft and running the test course in record time. He protects his surrogate son from danger when he would have been shot down, then flies him to safety at the films end.\n\nNothing of consequence is conceded. In true propaganda fashion, the audience is posed a tough question and blessed with an affirmation. And we all have Cruise to thank for it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTo be honest, I hadn’t thought much about Tom Cruise these past twenty years, and hadn’t thought much of him before that. But he’s always existed in cinema’s consciousness, plying a craft exclusively his own. Having stumbled into *Top Gun: Maverick* with the most modest of expectations, then having expectations blown out of the water forced me to consider who, or rather what, this character is.\n\nThe final verdict is Tom Cruise is a willing slave to his artform, and captive to the forces that fueled his ascension. It is not possible to know how his story will end. It is in three parts equally likely that his legacy will remain untarnished till death, that he will go down with the ship of Scientology at some point, or that his own skills of image maintenance and illusion will fail to keep pace with natural human frailty, leading to some jarring and uncanny public display or event, reminiscent to the infamous Oprah appearance but made uglier by age.\n\nRegardless of final outcome, *Top Gun: Maverick* is the very height of Tom Cruise’s film career. He took the two oldest traditions in American Cinema - war propaganda and popcorn escapism - and combined them with his unique resume to create a film that spoke directly to the existential crises facing both the medium and the nation. In an industry that fashions itself on pure mimicry of success, he has bent the timeline.\n\nAs it is the peak of his film career, so too by extension is it the peak of his life. It is the consequence of wielding such monolithic certainty across all spheres of experience that a man in his Brooklyn bedroom could call another man’s high point in life without a shred of second guessing.\n\nOf course my opinion could never pierce, dent, streak or perhaps even touch Cruise’s outer wall, so immaculately charged as it is by fully-actualized thetan energy. The question is, can Cruise recognize the summit himself? And how will that reckoning unfold? Will he continue that thought process from Iceman’s office, and at last confront a self that cannot let go? Or will he go the way of another co-star, Jack Nicholson’s Col. Jessup, screaming “You can’t handle the truth” as the MP’s of modernity drag him away.\n\nRead back those last questions and apply them to his avatars: to whiteness, to Boomers, to America. All at a summit, a natural inflection. Which truths will be chosen and which will be shunned, in rejection of natural diminishment.\n\nThese are the burning questions in the dawning days of Apex Hollywood.\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xc6b17e05d78228bc38ee100a99e7f2ca348ad2f8/1](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xc6b17e05d78228bc38ee100a99e7f2ca348ad2f8/1)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658779535, "digest": "r5eORdcQqHVCxkfI0ara5-YaeZ4UTYVO4hn1s8WYQfo", "contributor": "0x1dB9fA416F92355da29e50340D45E92f76D3AA9e"}

This not only would make any escape attempt easier, but also allow for the chance for Silvae to look for Tally in the light of day. Comfortable in the knowledge that he had the outline of a plan forming, Silvae lay back against the rock wall and closed his eyes. He figured he was somewhere beyond the mountain pass, not quite in the Areturusian republic, but in the lawless border lands between the Forest and the Red. With this assumed knowledge in hand, Silvae drifted off to sleep, the faint dripping of water on rock soothing him into a relaxed state of contentment. \n\nSnapping back to reality, Silvae felt the chain around his feet tugging. Groggily he opened his eyes and realized that it was morning already and that there was quite a commotion around him. In the night it had seemed that he was alone in a single cavern, but now, with the light of day winding through inlets in the cavern structure, Silvae saw the fully illuminated structure of a temple. Silvae, both shocked and in awe at the architectural wonder that he found himself amongst, was equally taken aback when he saw the sheer number of people around him. Casting his eye over what he thought had been the edge of the cavern wall, he noticed 5 more chambers just like his, each part of the larger super structure and accessible by a labyrinth of tunnel passages below. In seeing this Silvae was somewhat relieved that he had not attempted to flee in the night, he surely would have at best been caught and at worst been stuck wandering around the cavernous maze below. \n\nCasting his eye across the temple chambers, Silvae judged that there were at least 100 people under guard, each clad in what seemed like dirtied ceremonial rags that had seen better days. Each cohort was chained in groups of five to a single piece of reinforced timber that was overwatched by a single guard. The operation was much larger than Silvae had anticipated and much more heavily guarded. Silvae’s group, still sitting on the temple floor, consisted of the lost souls he had seen the previous night. Although his group was not yet in motion, being the 5th and final chamber of the larger superstructure, Silvae judged that his group would be moving out last. The guards all looked like they belonged to a single order. Dressed almost identically to Djatar, it became apparent that this was some sort of religious sect. Silvae thought over his situation. It was a much more complex undertaking to break the chain and flee, as he was constantly under guard but moreover, would have to break free of the larger piece of timber that was keeping his group together. He reasoned that this was deliberately the reason they were in groups of five, as it would take them all working together to lift the timber and walk which did not grant any one participant the chance to flee on one's own. They either moved together or not at all. \n\n“You’re awake” interjected Djartar, “Get to your feet now friend, we have much ground to cover today”. \n\nSilvae had not seen Djatar approach, but it was clear to him that he had been watching over him for a while. Although not guarding a specific section of the detainees, Djatar seemed to be in command of the overall operation, as he strolled about inspecting chain links and rousing prisoners. Although in control, Djatar held the same aloofness with his own men as he did with Silvae and the other prisoners. It was an odd tone of voice that he used to command them, not entirely authoritative but rather indirect. Turning back to Silvae after inspecting the timber that held his group together, Djatar threw Silvae another piece of stale bread. “Save that my friend, you will need to preserve your strength.”   \n\nSilvae, looking up at Djatar, did not say anything. Instinctively he knew that it was impossible to bargain with the man, and that the task at hand was what was most important to Djatar and his men. “Up now, up, up” barked a guard, and Silvae’s group rose to their feet. “Lift, lift, lift” barked the guard again, and Silvae’s group shuffled under the large timber beam and awkwardly raised it up over their heads. Silvae, who was last in line on the chain, could not make out the path ahead of him but followed the steps of the raspy voiced man in front of him. None of them made any sound besides that of physical effort, and the troupe marched silently down a winding tunnel. After what seemed like 20-30 minutes of winding, the entrance to the temple structure started to come into view. It was an unassuming yet vast expanse of caves jutting out of the mountain side. Although partially obscured by a sea of rock, the cave naturally held a vantage point that allowed for maximum light to enter. Silvae, although unable to see beyond a sea of light and sand, felt the warm air bounce off his face. \n\n“Left side left path” bellowed their section guard, and the troupe veered off the rocky cavern floors and onto warm sand. They awkwardly began a slow descent down the side of the mountain, the tail end of the 20 or so columns of walkers ahead of them. Walking down the path it became apparent that one wrong step would undo the footing of the troupe entirely, and Silvae began to form the semblance of a plan.\n\n### Should Silvae:\n\n1\\.) Deliberately fall and try and use the chaos to flee.\n\n2\\.) Deliberately fall into his guard and attempt to steal something to break his chain.\n\n3\\.) Deliberately fall and bring down as many other groups in front of him and then try and flee.\n\n4\\.) Deliberately fall and drag his own group down the mountain side and flee. \n  \n **Vote here:**\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/thelucidplanet.eth/proposal/0x8deb89649d94916a170c94d1d4c465055ea31db3c3231eac91cb78d48f2daadb](https://snapshot.org/#/thelucidplanet.eth/proposal/0x8deb89649d94916a170c94d1d4c465055ea31db3c3231eac91cb78d48f2daadb)\n\n[Read the rest of the episodes](https://mirror.xyz/0x7ee6236f9E888988469b671cf4B6b0D33e9540C1/HnwchDTr7UfSFX7eNKa6hwxYJBtR3rwCk4RrcwW8xf4) | [Join our Discord](http://discord.gg/thelucidplanet) | [Join us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelucidplanet)", "timestamp": 1658780457, "digest": "2dbDbtvZHjLw49NrobvQdSMmEHAjR3DKg_s4DcLnYk4", "contributor": "0x7ee6236f9E888988469b671cf4B6b0D33e9540C1"}
