By that point, the film had already eclipsed one billion dollars at the box office, including the first ever $100 million dollar opening weekend for star and super-producer Tom Cruise - a fact that gets more astonishing the longer you think about it.**\n\nI had heard all the project buzz, well-seeded by the press team into the general mediascape: the revolutionary filming techniques; the bootcamp Cruise put his junior castmates through to meet his stunt standards; and the defiance of contemporary Hollywood business practice by both eschewing direct-to-streaming and by refusing to cater to Chinese censorship norms. The word of mouth in my world had been good but not earth shattering. While it was my intent all along to see the film in theaters, it was ultimately the combination of a hot day and aimless time spent with my friend Malthe that compelled us to attend a matinee viewing in the icy confines of the Windsor Terrace Nite Hawk.\n\nTo call the movie good and leave it there would be to sell the experience short in no less than half a dozen ways. Simple superlatives do not explain a film experience as this, rendered with such singular confidence. It has all the potential to be a sea change in how we understand American filmmaking, the still-principal cultural medium in a country whose primary export is culture.\n\nIt exists in a rare pantheon of films: sequels that are strict upgrades to their predecessors, and even within that club may have no peer due to the unique opportunities the time between productions afforded it. And above all else, it is the masterstroke of a man whose dedicated his life to movie magic, such that he himself is both an unplumbable illusion and a vessel of self-assurance, capable of leveraging his oeuvre, clout, and historical circumstance to lead a film team in the production of a movie where he alternates not roles, but avatars: Maverick, Boomer, White Man, and, at times, America itself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe movie begins universally across screenings with the nearly unthinkable: a fourth-wall break from a weathered yet glowing Cruise. With this brief, thirty second look behind the curtain, the stakes of the film are raised exponentially. It postures Cruise in a moment of vulnerability - a feint, of course, as he is functionally incapable of the control concessions necessary for vulnerability, but the effect is nonetheless achieved.\n\nHere we have him exhibiting more age than we’ll see in the subsequent feature, talking directly with the audience about once again celebrating the cinematic experience - his entire reason for being - in the wake of a centennial pandemic. This is a movie star pushing his entire reputation into the center of the table for ideas bigger than himself, some apparent in the moment and others evident as the film plays out. It’s a level of assuredness that underwrites the entire experience to follow, itself a story about the supreme confidence of men and women so trained in technical excellence and national values that they can feel their way to achievements beyond rational limits.\n\nIt’s the movie craft equivalent of a cantrip, yet over and over in message boards and comment sections, this simple intro is called out as relatable and meaningful to the audience’s viewing experience. The message is clear: Tom Cruise would like us to help him save Cinema.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Top Gun: Maverick* is unambiguously an American propaganda film. This is a genre deeply entrenched in the nation’s cinematic DNA, dating all the way back to the first Oscar winner for best picture, 1927’s *Wings*, itself a collaboration with the United States Army Air Corps.\n\nThis is not to say *Top Gun: Maverick* deals in heavy handed symbolism or grandstanding. Another way to describe it would be a celebration of national values, yet this is too permissive in the other direction. What audiences are presented in the 2:11 runtime is a new way to look at America’s standing in the world in relation to the elephant pointedly *not* in the room, China.\n\nGone are the tropes we’re used to in most American military propaganda films. There’s no liberation or freedom motive. Terrorism prevention is the mission conceit, but the threat is consistently matter of fact, emotionless, and hidden behind visors when finally encountered. Most interestingly, technological superiority is not ensured, as the mission parameters call for outmoded F-18’s to outduel “fifth generation” enemy fighter planes.\n\nWhat takes the place of these standards? A collection of American ideals well-suited to foil contemporary totalitarianism. Embodying America’s conscience, Cruise imprints upon superior officer John Hamm the equal importance of government motive and pilot lives. Time and again, the *individual* is identified as the difference maker, not the machine. And perhaps most surprisingly, diversity of sex and race among our heroes is both prominent and deftly handled, causing a different type of American pride to well up after decades of hard fought, fractious, yet crucial culture wars. When dealing with rivals at a global stage that are actively homogenizing their populace through reeducation and genocide, this matters.\n\nTotal credit to the Top Gun team - with special callouts for Cinematographer Claudio Miranda and Director Joseph Kosinski - for managing to strike a synthesis of modern values and national propaganda. If ever there were a time to aim for a common ground boost to a nation’s morale, this is it, coming off a generational catastrophe that typically would create a “rally around the flag” effect, but instead pressed the political climate further toward acrimony and totalitarian flirtings. It’s these types of gestures that will need to happen across various spheres of life, not just the political arena, for America to start thinking again as one nation and not a collection of battleground states. It is not surprising that the first meaningful step towards this goal comes from the popcorn movie industry, whose weekly box office numbers are reported in the same news segment as the Dow Jones and sports scores.\n\nAll this said, there remains the ever present danger inherent to all works of propaganda: unquestioned certitude. There exists not a stitch of moral ambiguity or indecisiveness in this film, from its screenplay up to its star. This is masterfully masked by the elite Hollywood craftsmanship, burnished to the point where the audience will agree with any logic and view any caricature in the most charitable light.\n\nStarting at the most liminal level, war is treated as a granted necessity. And of course it is, as we wouldn’t have a film without it. But the concept of the United States unilaterally, preemptively, and clandestinely bombing a rogue state 3 weeks before it violates a multilateral NATO treaty is as farfetched as it is disturbing for any viewer stopping to grok the logic. Any attempt to suss out the reasoning outside the film’s working parameters instantly imperils the thinker ethically: “America does this all the time,” ”War is the price of safety,” ”They were asking for it.”\n\nAs far as *Top Gun: Maverick* is concerned, failure to address these questions is a feature, not a flaw. Tackling America’s deep-seeded love for military might captured on film is for another day and project. In order to hit the thematic heights it’s aiming for, an unblemished runway is required for any chance of success. And what better chance to achieve liftoff velocity than John Hamm and Tom Cruise trading military bluster over the slickest mission briefing UI the navy has ever seen.\n\nChipping in at times during the briefing is Charles Parnell, admirably performing the role of Solomon ‘Warlock’ Bates. He serves as the administrative release valve for Cruise’s Maverick, validating his unorthodox practices and allowing the audience to see levity in Maverick’s otherwise insubordinate acts. Here again the film pressed forward with mach-speed confidence, caught between America’s contemporary diversity ideals - i.e., establishing a Black man in a position of authority - and Cruise’s superstar gravity, which renders every character he comes into contact with as supplicant to his will. The same effect can be felt with Bashir Salahuddin’s character “Hondo,” who violates orders on Maverick’s behalf and follows him to his new post to serve as his airplane caddy. While these interactions are again navigated well given the non-stop certitude the film requires to stay airborne, it inexorably positions Cruise as a white man that can do no wrong.\n\nAt the start of the final act, just as Cruise has assumed control as mission leader in defiance of age and military orthodoxy, Warlock stops him for a moment alone. He earnestly confides, “Captain Mitchell, you’re where you belong. Make us proud.” The subtext of this is just narrowly subdued by the feeling of comradery between the two characters.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWere it restricted to the ranks of officer relations, this portrait of Cruise as an avatar of whiteness might not seem as salient. When moving towards the romantic component of the film, however, the comparison becomes unavoidable. Credit first to the film team for yet again incorporating contemporary ideals of courtship into the film’s unflinching perspective. The romance logic of the first film can charitably be described as a relic of a bygone era and fairly described as a contributing factor to decades worth of sexual consent issues America still grapples with today.\n\nIn comparison, *Top Gun: Maverick* unfurls an old flame relationship between Cruise and kindred 80’s icon Jennifer Connelly that feels balanced in power and grounded in life experience. Kudos too for what was not pursued, namely any hints of a relationship between Lt. Natasha “Phoenix” Trace - played flawlessly by Monica Barbaro - and any of her squad mates.\n\nThe screen time shared between “Pete” (Cruise) and “Penny” (Connelly) represents Maverick’s downtime, playfulness, and relatability. Any intrusion to the atmosphere of pure leisure is related to Cruise’s work struggles and the mysterious theme of “letting go”. It’s telling, therefore, that each locale and set-up feels archetypically white. There’s the Jimmy Buffet beach bar owned by Penny, whose soundtrack alternates between Classic Rock jukebox tracks and spontaneous singalongs to Jerry Lee Lewis’ “Great Balls of Fire”. A second date yacht excursion finds Penny teaching Pete to sail while dressed in immaculate J. Crew attire. And in the off hours, we retreat to Penny’s idyllic bungalow on a hill, just as easily at home in Cape Cod were it not for the palm trees.\n\nRecent decades of the ongoing dialogue around race in America have focused the conversation around whiteness as access for societal navigation. At the same time, there’s an understandable urge to compare whiteness to Blackness, which in contrast is a true culture born of hardship and galvanized by perseverance. Finding consumer access naturally a cultural non-starter, the search for comparable white identity has pushed some searchers down dark paths, leading to Confederate flags in Northern strongholds and Nazi rallies on capital lawns.\n\nAnd yet here in *Top Gun: Maverick* we see a third option, one rendered routinely in times past but impossible to show generously in today’s age without that killer instinct confidence. It is that of the White Anglo Saxon Protestant, the American royalty, unattainable yet aspirational in the land of hard work of dreams.\n\nRightfully rejected in the real world for its detachment from reality, it’s a taste of sun-dipped heaven and infinite leisure that marks America’s cultural understanding of what successfully planned golden years might look like. Only a megawatt star in an expertly rendered propaganda film with an audience begging for normalcy could possibly pull it off. But Cruise is exactly that star, and a big subset of that audience - Baby Boomers - is betting their whole mortality on it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCruise himself is just inside the generational cusp, having turned sixty the July 3rd after release. This is even better for those pinning their escapism to him, as he’s the youngest, spryest version of the class.\n\nIn the film, Maverick is set up to be the mentor figure, the teacher to the next generation of Top Gun pilots. At every turn he resists while the powers in charge hammer home that he has to “let go”, that his age is over and a new age is arriving.\n\nAnd yet, he doesn’t have to let go. At all. At least when it comes to the idea that the flight game is passing him by. In one of the most satisfying segments, Cruise introduces himself to his new class by squaring off against them in a series of dogfighting exercises, with losers sentenced to 200 tarmac pushups. Time and again, Cruise displays his veteran wiles and supernaturally undiminished reflexes, all punctuated by the choicest cuts of The Who’s “Won’t Get Fooled Again.” As each young gun falls and the push-up totals mount, the aura of invincibility and moral certainty around Cruise is secured for the remainder of the film.\n\nThe message to the Boomer-era audience is clear: we ain’t dead yet. And the rest of the audience gleefully falls in line, as Cruise and his electric persona can flatten all nuance and for them be the connection to an America that perpetually exists in the past, free of ambiguity and brimming with values we all can agree on.\n\nThe only question in the film left is whether or not this national and generational relic can survive one “final'' mission. The movie posits this question masterfully, as Maverick states in his mission assessment that “someone isn’t coming back from this one.” It’s that simple logic conflict of Cruise’s utter certitude and undefeated skill that keeps the fate of these porcelain precious concepts teetering over uncertainty for longer than most stories of its ilk.\n\nWhen - spoiler alert - the final verdict does come in, the production once again delivers with masterful execution. Maverick sacrifices himself for his wingman Rooster (Bradley Bradshaw), surrogate son and actual son of his deceased wingman from the previous film, Goose. Chaos and confusion set in, and the remaining squad members are called back to the carriers for safety. There’s a fade to black that could plausibly return us to the mainland and an honorable funeral, until with great relief the camera returns to Maverick, untangling himself from parachute gear and wondering what to do next.\n\nAt this point, the greatest trick in the film’s arsenal is revealed to the audience. Rooster naturally saves Maverick’s life and the pair are stuck behind enemy lines with no plan in mind. It is here that a great dawning collectively appears to every single theater goer.\n\n“Holy shit, we’re in a spy film now.”\n\nThe combination of Maverick’s unquestioned skillset and Cruise’s unbeatable movie resume allow him to summon *Mission Impossible’s* Ethan Hunt in an instant. The two infiltrate the enemy airbase, steal a jet and take off from a missile-pocked runway against impossible odds. The fact that they’re now tasked with fighting their way home against superior aircraft in an enemy F-14 - The plane used in the original *Top Gun* - takes those national and generational narratives and triples down.\n\nBut by now victory is a foregone conclusion. The audience can enjoy every thrill on the way back to the carrier safely knowing each intervention will favor our heroes. When hotshot pilot Hangman - spiritual torch bearer to the masculine urgency of the first film, played pitch perfect by Glen Powell - delivers the pair from certain death at the last instant, all accounts are settled and we’re ready for the celebratory, carrier deck mosh pit.\n\nIn the film’s final moments, as Rooster and Maverick work lovingly on a plane together, Penny drives up to the hanger in a 1973 Porshe 911 S to seal the romantic loose ends. It might as well be B-roll from the greatest Viagra commercial ever made, but as they literally fly off into the sunset in Cruise’s own P-51 Mustang, all is right and golden.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAll of this is far from the most impactful moment of the film. That would occur roughly somewhere in the middle, as Maverick pays a visit to his old friend from the original film Iceman (Val Kilmer). In the intervening decades, Iceman has climbed the naval ranks while Maverick has stayed as a Captain. Maverick’s high placed friend has saved him from career ruin on many occasions, ultimately bringing him back to Top Gun for the “final” mission.\n\nThe scene is most obviously affecting due to Kilmer’s real life struggle with throat cancer and its residual effects. Robbed of speech, Iceman communicates via prompts typed on a computer. The moment is fashioned as a therapy session, and it's here that Maverick, Boomer, White Man and American Tom Cruise gets the closest he may ever get to revealing his essence.\n\n“It’s time to let go,” writes Kilmer, fully wielding the authority of mortality.\n\n“I don’t know how,” replies Cruise tearfully. And in that one moment, all truths align for both the film and the entire Tom Cruise spectacle. He clarifies further still, stating that being Maverick is not “who I am, it’s what I am.”\n\nHere we are at the knife’s edge of Tom Cruise’s entire identity - sparkling diamond vessel suited only for pure archetype. Witnessing this moment as an audience member, I dared dream we might actually see it: a world where Tom Cruise relents, placing his helmet aside and joining the realm of the mortals, where identities are fixed but at least they’re your own.\n\nOf course this could never happen, not now for Cruise and certainly not for the film’s logic. Like a captive whale pressed tight against the glass, slowly he recedes to the aquarium’s shadows, relating “letting go” to the structurally sound yet emotionally innocuous paternal angle: moving out of Rooster’s way and letting him become a true pilot like his real father.\n\nAnd even in that, the film lets Cruise and all his adherents have their cake and eat it too. He leads the mission out of all the young guns after stealing an aircraft and running the test course in record time. He protects his surrogate son from danger when he would have been shot down, then flies him to safety at the films end.\n\nNothing of consequence is conceded. In true propaganda fashion, the audience is posed a tough question and blessed with an affirmation. And we all have Cruise to thank for it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTo be honest, I hadn’t thought much about Tom Cruise these past twenty years, and hadn’t thought much of him before that. But he’s always existed in cinema’s consciousness, plying a craft exclusively his own. Having stumbled into *Top Gun: Maverick* with the most modest of expectations, then having expectations blown out of the water forced me to consider who, or rather what, this character is.\n\nThe final verdict is Tom Cruise is a willing slave to his artform, and captive to the forces that fueled his ascension. It is not possible to know how his story will end. It is in three parts equally likely that his legacy will remain untarnished till death, that he will go down with the ship of Scientology at some point, or that his own skills of image maintenance and illusion will fail to keep pace with natural human frailty, leading to some jarring and uncanny public display or event, reminiscent to the infamous Oprah appearance but made uglier by age.\n\nRegardless of final outcome, *Top Gun: Maverick* is the very height of Tom Cruise’s film career. He took the two oldest traditions in American Cinema - war propaganda and popcorn escapism - and combined them with his unique resume to create a film that spoke directly to the existential crises facing both the medium and the nation. In an industry that fashions itself on pure mimicry of success, he has bent the timeline.\n\nAs it is the peak of his film career, so too by extension is it the peak of his life. It is the consequence of wielding such monolithic certainty across all spheres of experience that a man in his Brooklyn bedroom could call another man’s high point in life without a shred of second guessing.\n\nOf course my opinion could never pierce, dent, streak or perhaps even touch Cruise’s outer wall, so immaculately charged as it is by fully-actualized thetan energy. The question is, can Cruise recognize the summit himself? And how will that reckoning unfold? Will he continue that thought process from Iceman’s office, and at last confront a self that cannot let go? Or will he go the way of another co-star, Jack Nicholson’s Col. Jessup, screaming “You can’t handle the truth” as the MP’s of modernity drag him away.\n\nRead back those last questions and apply them to his avatars: to whiteness, to Boomers, to America. All at a summit, a natural inflection. Which truths will be chosen and which will be shunned, in rejection of natural diminishment.\n\nThese are the burning questions in the dawning days of Apex Hollywood.\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xc6b17e05d78228bc38ee100a99e7f2ca348ad2f8/1](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xc6b17e05d78228bc38ee100a99e7f2ca348ad2f8/1)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658779535, "digest": "r5eORdcQqHVCxkfI0ara5-YaeZ4UTYVO4hn1s8WYQfo", "contributor": "0x1dB9fA416F92355da29e50340D45E92f76D3AA9e"}

This not only would make any escape attempt easier, but also allow for the chance for Silvae to look for Tally in the light of day. Comfortable in the knowledge that he had the outline of a plan forming, Silvae lay back against the rock wall and closed his eyes. He figured he was somewhere beyond the mountain pass, not quite in the Areturusian republic, but in the lawless border lands between the Forest and the Red. With this assumed knowledge in hand, Silvae drifted off to sleep, the faint dripping of water on rock soothing him into a relaxed state of contentment. \n\nSnapping back to reality, Silvae felt the chain around his feet tugging. Groggily he opened his eyes and realized that it was morning already and that there was quite a commotion around him. In the night it had seemed that he was alone in a single cavern, but now, with the light of day winding through inlets in the cavern structure, Silvae saw the fully illuminated structure of a temple. Silvae, both shocked and in awe at the architectural wonder that he found himself amongst, was equally taken aback when he saw the sheer number of people around him. Casting his eye over what he thought had been the edge of the cavern wall, he noticed 5 more chambers just like his, each part of the larger super structure and accessible by a labyrinth of tunnel passages below. In seeing this Silvae was somewhat relieved that he had not attempted to flee in the night, he surely would have at best been caught and at worst been stuck wandering around the cavernous maze below. \n\nCasting his eye across the temple chambers, Silvae judged that there were at least 100 people under guard, each clad in what seemed like dirtied ceremonial rags that had seen better days. Each cohort was chained in groups of five to a single piece of reinforced timber that was overwatched by a single guard. The operation was much larger than Silvae had anticipated and much more heavily guarded. Silvae’s group, still sitting on the temple floor, consisted of the lost souls he had seen the previous night. Although his group was not yet in motion, being the 5th and final chamber of the larger superstructure, Silvae judged that his group would be moving out last. The guards all looked like they belonged to a single order. Dressed almost identically to Djatar, it became apparent that this was some sort of religious sect. Silvae thought over his situation. It was a much more complex undertaking to break the chain and flee, as he was constantly under guard but moreover, would have to break free of the larger piece of timber that was keeping his group together. He reasoned that this was deliberately the reason they were in groups of five, as it would take them all working together to lift the timber and walk which did not grant any one participant the chance to flee on one's own. They either moved together or not at all. \n\n“You’re awake” interjected Djartar, “Get to your feet now friend, we have much ground to cover today”. \n\nSilvae had not seen Djatar approach, but it was clear to him that he had been watching over him for a while. Although not guarding a specific section of the detainees, Djatar seemed to be in command of the overall operation, as he strolled about inspecting chain links and rousing prisoners. Although in control, Djatar held the same aloofness with his own men as he did with Silvae and the other prisoners. It was an odd tone of voice that he used to command them, not entirely authoritative but rather indirect. Turning back to Silvae after inspecting the timber that held his group together, Djatar threw Silvae another piece of stale bread. “Save that my friend, you will need to preserve your strength.”   \n\nSilvae, looking up at Djatar, did not say anything. Instinctively he knew that it was impossible to bargain with the man, and that the task at hand was what was most important to Djatar and his men. “Up now, up, up” barked a guard, and Silvae’s group rose to their feet. “Lift, lift, lift” barked the guard again, and Silvae’s group shuffled under the large timber beam and awkwardly raised it up over their heads. Silvae, who was last in line on the chain, could not make out the path ahead of him but followed the steps of the raspy voiced man in front of him. None of them made any sound besides that of physical effort, and the troupe marched silently down a winding tunnel. After what seemed like 20-30 minutes of winding, the entrance to the temple structure started to come into view. It was an unassuming yet vast expanse of caves jutting out of the mountain side. Although partially obscured by a sea of rock, the cave naturally held a vantage point that allowed for maximum light to enter. Silvae, although unable to see beyond a sea of light and sand, felt the warm air bounce off his face. \n\n“Left side left path” bellowed their section guard, and the troupe veered off the rocky cavern floors and onto warm sand. They awkwardly began a slow descent down the side of the mountain, the tail end of the 20 or so columns of walkers ahead of them. Walking down the path it became apparent that one wrong step would undo the footing of the troupe entirely, and Silvae began to form the semblance of a plan.\n\n### Should Silvae:\n\n1\\.) Deliberately fall and try and use the chaos to flee.\n\n2\\.) Deliberately fall into his guard and attempt to steal something to break his chain.\n\n3\\.) Deliberately fall and bring down as many other groups in front of him and then try and flee.\n\n4\\.) Deliberately fall and drag his own group down the mountain side and flee. \n  \n **Vote here:**\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/thelucidplanet.eth/proposal/0x8deb89649d94916a170c94d1d4c465055ea31db3c3231eac91cb78d48f2daadb](https://snapshot.org/#/thelucidplanet.eth/proposal/0x8deb89649d94916a170c94d1d4c465055ea31db3c3231eac91cb78d48f2daadb)\n\n[Read the rest of the episodes](https://mirror.xyz/0x7ee6236f9E888988469b671cf4B6b0D33e9540C1/HnwchDTr7UfSFX7eNKa6hwxYJBtR3rwCk4RrcwW8xf4) | [Join our Discord](http://discord.gg/thelucidplanet) | [Join us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelucidplanet)", "timestamp": 1658780457, "digest": "2dbDbtvZHjLw49NrobvQdSMmEHAjR3DKg_s4DcLnYk4", "contributor": "0x7ee6236f9E888988469b671cf4B6b0D33e9540C1"}

{"id": "8zbzexQScDZ9_yAqgOkYvnACW-MnCcs5RHDS9YSfnjA", "title": "Publicación de Fatman en Twitter", "body": "La subindustria de los \"seguros DeFi\" está fundamentalmente rota. Está plagado de manipulaciones, conflictos de intereses y estafas. Veamos cómo estos problemas afectan a servicios como InsurAce y Kleros, que se apropian injustamente de los fondos de los legítimos reclamantes. (1/20)\n\n1. Los puntos clave de decisión suelen estar centralizados a pesar de la \"DAO\"\n\nTomando el ejemplo de InsurAce, un \"protocolo de seguros descentralizado\", podemos ver que la mezcla de una \" DAO \" y de \" tokens de votación \" no hace necesariamente que un sistema sea tan descentralizado como parece. (2/20)\n\nEl modelo de InsurAce suena bien a primera vista: los proveedores de capital ponen fondos en un fondo común, los demandantes pueden comprar un seguro, y los titulares de tokens INSUR aprueban o rechazan las reclamaciones en un proceso de votación descentralizado. En teoría, se trata de un modelo de seguro distribuido y sin permisos. (3/20)\n\nPero un hecho clave es convenientemente pasado por alto - el equipo de InsurAce tiene el control exclusivo sobre las propuestas que se suben y cómo se redactan, lo que innegablemente influye en el resultado de cualquier votación. Abusan habitualmente de este poder para influir en las votaciones en la dirección que ellos eligen. (4/20)\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYgR2b9X0AAoa4k.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYgSAjoWQAEX4ry.jpg)\n\nAlgunos lo llamarán descentralizado, ya que hay tokens y luego esos tokens votan. Yo llamo a esto teatro de descentralización, porque ambos lados de la votación no están representados de manera justa y los temas que realmente van a una votación son (a menudo fraudulentamente) determinados únicamente por InsurAce. (7/20)\n\n1. Los conflictos de intereses están por todas partes\n\nUno supondría que con tantas capas descentralizadas de controles y equilibrios, los procesos serían automáticamente justos y neutrales. Pero, como han demostrado Unslashed y Kleros, todo ello se convierte en una mera farsa en el momento en que interviene el big money. (8/20)\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYgSPlJWYAIx94b.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYgSVITXoAAM6Fk.png)\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYgSdGrXkAAl8b9.jpg)\n\nFallar a favor de tus clientes más importantes (que te traerán más casos y, por tanto, más beneficios) es un incentivo inherente frente a fallar a favor de los demandantes que sólo utilizarán tu servicio una/dos veces en su vida, lo que podría explicar aún más el deseo de Kleros de manipular las sentencias. (12/20)\n\n¿Es tu protocolo descentralizado realmente descentralizado si el \"sistema de justicia\" que utilizas para dictar las sentencias está a) controlado por una élite y b) incentivado económicamente para fallar fuertemente a tu favor en vez de a favor de los demandantes? No lo creo. Es *peor* entonces que los sistemas tradicionales de finanzas (tradfi). (13/20)\n\n1. Estas cosas acaban entrando en el mundo real de todos modos\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYgSwPnXEAEc4OQ.jpg)\n\nAñadir cláusulas de seguro a posteriori, editar documentos en secreto, votar con carteras ocultas u ocultar conflictos de intereses es bastante fácil en un mundo anónimo en línea. ¿Qué ocurre cuando llega el momento de enfrentarse a un juez *realmente* imparcial, un tribunal de justicia? (15/20)\n\nLas implicaciones legales de todo esto son muy complejas y no voy a pretender entenderlas. Pero estoy totalmente asqueado de cómo estos protocolos estafan selectivamente a víctimas inocentes que creían estar protegidas, y espero que se enfrenten a la justicia sea como sea. (16/20)\n\nLa estafa selectiva da miedo, porque está bien disimulada. La mayoría de las demandas de menor cuantía saldrán adelante sin problemas, y habrá un gran número de partidarios auténticos. Pero la gente es estafada. Y nunca se sabe si uno puede convertirse en su próximo objetivo. (17/20)\n\nUn protocolo es tan descentralizado como su eslabón más centralizado, y parece que estos \"DAOs de seguros\" empiezan a funcionar por el capricho de uno o dos individuos cuando les apetece cambiar una decisión. Yo no les confiaría mi dinero bajo ningún concepto. (18/20)\n\n¿Hay alguna solución? No estoy seguro. Cuando lleguemos a un meta-nivel de \"seguro de DAO para otro DAO que falla\", creo que podría ser el momento de introducir procedimientos formales como la responsabilidad legal y la verdadera neutralidad. En el campo de los seguros y el arbitraje, la regulación no es tan mala. (19/20)\n\nSeguiré la evolución de estos casos legales con gran interés (académico). Y me gustaría advertir a mis compañeros de la red CT que sean conscientes de los verdaderos riesgos que hay detrás de los seguros DeFi, así como de las tácticas teatrales de descentralización bien ocultas que emplean para mantener la hegemonía.

It arises from the idea that smart contracts can do much more than simply storing an owner of an asset and most current projects don't make use of that. \n\nFor the project, we play with timezones and work schedules around the world, and create artificial trading hours for each token. Additionally, we also do a twist on the rarity meta, making the rarest tokens, the most difficult ones to trade.\n\n## I N S T R U C T I O N S :\n\nHello! Welcome to the Office Hours Project. This is the only official instructions to correctly mint your NFT.\n\n⚠️ PAY ATTENTION TO THESE INSTRUCTIONS! ⚠️\n\nThis will be a bit more complicated than your regular minting process, because we're doing a mechanic to keep bots and loopers away, but if you can follow a simple set of instructions, than you should have no problem.\n\n1. The first thing you need is to figure it out the address of your wallet . Have this on hand.\n2. Once you have that, you need to copy the last 4 digits of your address.\n3. Then you need to convert from hexadecimal to numeral. To do that, you can go to <https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html> and paste your 4 digits into the `Enter hex number` field box and click convert.\n4. Write down the converted number.  Should be a decimal between **0** and **65535.**\n5. This number will be used as the `verification` parameter to the mint function, together with the amount of tokens you want to mint.\n6. If the resulting number you got is odd, you need to call the `mintOdd` function. If it’s even, you call the `mintEven`.\n\nLet’s go over one example:\n\n1. Grab the sender address: `0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13`\n2. Get the last 4 digits: `7C13`\n3. Convert to decimal number: `31763`\n4. The resulting number (31763) is odd, so let’s call the `mintOdd` function\n5. Put the `amount` parameter, which represents how many tokens you want to mint. Must be between 1 and 2. For the `verification` you use the number you got on step 3.\n6. The call will be `mintOdd(amount: 2, verification: 31763)`\n7. Now just need to send the transaction.\n\n   [https://etherscan.io/address/0xA6C1C8ef0179071c16E066171d660dA4ad314687](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA6C1C8ef0179071c16E066171d660dA4ad314687)\n\n   [OPENSEA](https://opensea.io/collection/office-hours-official/) \n\n## T R A D I N G :\n\n![⚠️ PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE MECHANICS OF THIS PROJECT BEFORE PURCHASING ⚠️](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Efq_WfLDzdJMumUp1acuN.png?height=1474&width=1396)\n\n## O V E R T I M E :\n\nIf you want your token to be instantly tradable and it is currently not working, all you need to do is pay some overtime. For that, you need to get your token id and figure it out his hourly rate (you can check the metadata for it!)\n\nThe minimum overtime is 1h, but you can pay as much as you want and your character will work the exact amount of time you’re paying him to. So, if you send 1.5x his hourly rate, then he’ll be available for trading for 1:30h.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nHead to the contract address on Etherscan. Then choose the `payOvertime` function. Just send the token id you want to sent it to and choose the amount.\n\n## R O A D M A P ?  : H A R O L D  C R I N G E :\n\n[https://twitter.com/XCOPYART/status/1537172020215136257?s=20&t=sqe1ZRVj4I9ApPjOmHTzDw](https://twitter.com/XCOPYART/status/1537172020215136257?s=20&t=sqe1ZRVj4I9ApPjOmHTzDw)\n\n`XCOPY sums it up here: roadmap = empty promises.

In that meantime, I worked across different projects, from smart contract auditing, to stable coins, to oracles. I really like building smart contracts and that's what I mostly do for fun. My adventures in the NFT space always have been a side gig, as I still work full time as a developer on a defi protocol. I wanted to do Office Hours because I find that there's an overall lack of creativity in the space and I would love to spark some new ways that we can use the technology to do different kinds of projects.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xBasset](https://twitter.com/0xBasset)\n\n# R E N N S P O R T :\n\nI am a tortured soul. My dad left my mom before I was born and my mother developed a mental illness when I was a youth. My mom was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and was a victim of the absolutely horrendous mental health system in the United States. I was then abandoned by my greater family. I was forced to drop out of high school to take on a full-time job to care for myself at age 16. Luckily I was able to complete my GED and enroll into college to study art and graphic design, in the footsteps of my mother who was an honors art student.\n\nMy youth was filled with art in all types of mediums. Growing up I knew that I wanted to be an artist and my mom wanted me to be a nationally syndicated cartoonist. Sadly along with many many other artists such as myself I was unable to pursue art as a career. I have been struggling to find myself and my path ever since.\n\nI had an epiphany moment in the winter of 2021. My friend sent me an invite to the Clubhouse app. I was laying in bed in the middle of the night and somehow found my way into a room broadcasting the early episodes of [The Goodtime Show](https://www.thegoodtimeshow.club/). Brian Armstrong was on the episode as well as an executive from Binance and some a16z partners. They were discussing tech, cryptocurrency, NFTs, the state of the modern world and the state of the world to come. 💡 I felt like I finally found my calling. 💡 `There is no ceiling with the creativity involved with computer science.` I began to study the crypto industry heavily. I then found my way into trading (and getting rekt in) shitcoins and ultimately segued into NFTs and minted my first NFT - [Aavegotchi](https://www.aavegotchi.com/). Witnessing the exponential creative possibility of what was being built within the Aavegotchi ecosystem, I knew I was in the right place at the right time.\n\nI then was lucky enough to have followed [Andy Milonakis](https://twitter.com/andymilonakis) on Twitter and was up early one morning when I saw his tweet about the [Anonymice](https://opensea.io/collection/anonymice) mint. I was able to afford 1 genesis Anonymice on the secondary market (\\~$1700). The first 72 hours of the mint process was probably some of the most fun I have had in my entire life. Eventually I showed my passion for the community and was offered a position as a community manager by [Mouse Dev](https://twitter.com/_mousedev?lang=en). I felt like I finally found my new family. We generated over $50 million in trading volume within a few months time, all with 0 royalties (up until recently) and a free mint. I planned and hosted the first IRL Anonymice event at [Superchief Gallery NFT](https://twitter.com/SuperchiefNFT) in NYC, the world’s first physical NFT gallery. I also planned and hosted a party for Anonymice x [CyberKongz](https://twitter.com/CyberKongz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) x [CryptoHoots](https://twitter.com/CryptoHootsNFT) at PHD at Dream Downtown Hotel during NFT.NYC 2021 thanks to [Evuls](https://twitter.com/Evuls2). Looking back at what I have accomplished in the space in such a short time, It’s a wonder what someone can do when they really put their mind to it. I am a firm believer that you can manifest your own path if you have the right attitude and mindset.\n\nI am finally now back on the right track in life. With my free time I am learning to code, working on pixel art and building projects. I would really like to create a video game someday in the fashion of my greatest inspirations: [Earthbound](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/earthbound-3ds/) and [LISA](http://www.lisatherpg.com/). If you’re reading this and you are interested, please contact me and let’s build! I am also open to hire for pixel art and animation.\n\n`rennsport#6969`\n\n[https://twitter.com/rennsport_eth](https://twitter.com/rennsport_eth)\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Although the web3, crypto and NFT space can be quite the emotional rollercoaster ride and at times very toxic. It’s important to step back and understand what is happening from a macro level, the power of these emerging technologies, and the infinite creative outlet associated. My DMs are always open if anyone ever wants to chat! Even just about mental health or whatever is on your mind! \n\n### 👾 We hope you all enjoy Office Hours! 👾\n\n[https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658782972, "digest": "SEShkWja7bz6oSS4Vi7lhE0uvy1AKM_s1WSQE_NJ_sU", "contributor": "0x31027Cf4A9d6527d626474D040dB539B4B428bC4"}

Each purchase gives you ownership of the episode, as well as governance rights in Rehash DAO (more on that below).**\n\n[https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1364636214008061952?s=20&t=dgRtIZCppWyNwV7osVuBVA](https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1364636214008061952?s=20&t=dgRtIZCppWyNwV7osVuBVA)\n\nLimited editions (audio only) will be available for 0.1 ETH each, and 1/1s (audio + video) will be available for 1 ETH each.\n\nProceeds from the sale will be split between Rehash DAO, the host (Diana Chen), the producers (Tyler & Ellie), and the podcast guests.\n\n## Why ownership?\n\nOne of the biggest unlocks of web3 is ownership – and for creators, this means creative ownership over their own work.\n\nRather than giving centralized entities like YouTube, Spotify, and Instagram ownership over their content, data, and community, **creators can now take ownership into their own hands**.\n\n**NFTs enable creators to cut out the middleman** (i.e. YouTube, Spotify, etc), which has historically taken advantage of creators without providing an equal amount of value, and receive support directly from their fans and community.\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645850672308225?s=21&t=ztkF8AarU9jNrmARSww3HA](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645850672308225?s=21&t=ztkF8AarU9jNrmARSww3HA)\n\nIn exchange, **creators can offer their fans and community members perks that make them feel more like co-owners than mere fans**. For example, a creator might allow their NFT holding fans to decide the types of content they produce next, their future tour locations, or any other decisions – whether big or small – that they might need to make.\n\nThis results in **more money in the pockets of creators, happier fans, and stronger communities** – a win-win for all.\n\n## Governance rights\n\nFor Rehash, collecting one of our podcast NFTs means you get to **help us decide next season’s guests and make big decisions around the future of the larger Rehash DAO** (which tentatively includes a web3 content agency structured as a service DAO).\n\nAfter our Season 2 NFT sale, we’ll start a Season 3 guest nomination process followed by a voting period. During the nomination period, **all NFT holders will have the opportunity to nominate any guest** of their choosing who they think will be a good fit for the podcast. You can see last season’s nominees [here](https://snapshot.org/#/rehashweb3.eth).\n\n[https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1521895392887017472?s=20&t=vbCw22QpiSq-B5FRAoe87A](https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1521895392887017472?s=20&t=vbCw22QpiSq-B5FRAoe87A)\n\nOnce the nomination period closes, **holders of [Podcaster NFTs](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xb74c9f1eccddefbef7c017b97bd3a2f24a0081f8/2), blue Collector NFTs (airdropped to anyone who purchases a 1/1 podcast NFT), and podcast guest NFTs (airdropped to S2 podcast guests) will have the opportunity to cast their votes for their top picks**.\n\nFor Season 2, we had 41 guest nominations, 18 voted onto the podcast, and 16\\* who ultimately ended up coming onto the podcast.\n\n*\\*The 17th guest was our top backer of our Mirror crowdfund, which gave them the right to come on the podcast as a guest.*\n\n## NFT sale mechanics\n\nOn Tuesday, July 26, 2022, we’ll be releasing all 17 of our Season 2 episodes as NFTs on [Zora](https://zora.co/rehashpod.eth?status=LISTED&collection=).\n\n**Here’s a list of our Season 2 guests**:\n\n* S2 E1: Matt Gould (Unstoppable Domains)\n* S2 E2: Gary Sheng (Dream DAO)\n* S2 E3: Dayo Adeosun (Glass Protocol)\n* S2 E4: Spencer Graham (DAOhaus)\n* S2 E5: Kseniya & Nichanan (Meta Gamma Delta DAO)\n* S2 E6: Katherine Wu (Archetype)\n* S2 E7: Caryn Tan (Clarity; Crypto, Culture & Society)\n* S2 E8: Scott Moore (Gitcoin)\n* S2 E9: Ale Borda (Fifty Years)\n* S2 E10: Christina Beltramini (Aave, Lens)\n* S2 E11: Stefen Deleveaux (Govrn; Caribbean Blockchain Alliance)\n* S2 E12: Deana Burke & Natasha Hoskins (Boys Club)\n* S2 E13: Brenner Spear (Metagame)\n* S2 E14: Richerd (Manifold)\n* S2 E15: Anastasia Uglova (Lighthouse)\n* S2 E16: Nick DeWilde (Invisible College)\n* S2 E17: LATASHÁ (Zora/topia)\n\n*Each episode will be available as a **limited edition (10/10) for 0.1 ETH each or a 1/1 for 1 ETH each.***\n\n### Limited edition\n\nLimited edition podcast NFTs include the **audio** of the podcast episode and a **[white collector NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xb74c9f1eccddefbef7c017b97bd3a2f24a0081f8/8)**. The white collector NFT allows holders to nominate guests for the podcast but ***not*** vote for which guests ultimately get invited on.\n\nThere are 10 limited editions of each episode from Season 2. Each limited edition costs 0.1 ETH, and 15% of the proceeds will go to the guest(s) featured on that episode.\n\n![white collector NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tjDFw1be1Wg4Sb6hOb47t.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n### 1/1\n\n1/1 podcast NFTs include the **audio and video** of the podcast episode and a **[blue collector NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xb74c9f1eccddefbef7c017b97bd3a2f24a0081f8/7)**. The blue collector NFT allows holders to nominate ***and*** vote on guests for the podcast.\n\nThere is a 1/1 podcast NFT available for each episode from Season 2.

Growing up I knew that I wanted to be an artist and my mom wanted me to be a nationally syndicated cartoonist. Sadly along with many many other artists such as myself I was unable to pursue art as a career. I have been struggling to find myself and my path ever since.\n\nI had an epiphany moment in the winter of 2021. My friend sent me an invite to the Clubhouse app. I was laying in bed in the middle of the night and somehow found my way into a room broadcasting the early episodes of [The Goodtime Show](https://www.thegoodtimeshow.club/). Brian Armstrong was on the episode as well as an executive from Binance and some a16z partners. They were discussing tech, cryptocurrency, NFTs, the state of the modern world and the state of the world to come. 💡 I felt like I finally found my calling. 💡 `There is no ceiling with the creativity involved with computer science.` I began to study the crypto industry heavily. I then found my way into trading (and getting rekt in) shitcoins and ultimately segued into NFTs and minted my first NFT - [Aavegotchi](https://www.aavegotchi.com/). Witnessing the exponential creative possibility of what was being built within the Aavegotchi ecosystem, I knew I was in the right place at the right time.\n\nI then was lucky enough to have followed [Andy Milonakis](https://twitter.com/andymilonakis) on Twitter and was up early one morning when I saw his tweet about the [Anonymice](https://opensea.io/collection/anonymice) mint. I was able to afford 1 genesis Anonymice on the secondary market (\\~$1700). The first 72 hours of the mint process was probably some of the most fun I have had in my entire life. Eventually I showed my passion for the community and was offered a position as a community manager by [Mouse Dev](https://twitter.com/_mousedev?lang=en). I felt like I finally found my new family. We generated over $50 million in trading volume within a few months time, all with 0 royalties (up until recently) and a free mint. I planned and hosted the first IRL Anonymice event at [Superchief Gallery NFT](https://twitter.com/SuperchiefNFT) in NYC, the world’s first physical NFT gallery. I also planned and hosted a party for Anonymice x [CyberKongz](https://twitter.com/CyberKongz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) x [CryptoHoots](https://twitter.com/CryptoHootsNFT) at PHD at Dream Downtown Hotel during NFT.NYC 2021 thanks to [Evuls](https://twitter.com/Evuls2). Looking back at what I have accomplished in the space in such a short time, It’s a wonder what someone can do when they really put their mind to it. I am a firm believer that you can manifest your own path if you have the right attitude and mindset.\n\nI am finally now back on the right track in life. With my free time I am learning to code, working on pixel art and building projects. I would really like to create a video game someday in the fashion of my greatest inspirations: [Earthbound](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/earthbound-3ds/) and [LISA](http://www.lisatherpg.com/). If you’re reading this and you are interested, please contact me and let’s build! I am also open to hire for pixel art and animation.\n\n`rennsport#6969`\n\n[https://twitter.com/rennsport_eth](https://twitter.com/rennsport_eth)\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Although the web3, crypto and NFT space can be quite the emotional rollercoaster ride and at times very toxic. It’s important to step back and understand what is happening from a macro level, the power of these emerging technologies, and the infinite creative outlet associated. My DMs are always open if anyone ever wants to chat! Even just about mental health or whatever is on your mind! \n\n### 👾 We hope you all enjoy Office Hours! 👾\n\n[https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658783067, "digest": "io3iq4aBK3WvIu4Fx6yqUC5PmP5mdge6ikSYUfCWbzQ", "contributor": "0x31027Cf4A9d6527d626474D040dB539B4B428bC4"}

The market cooled down a lot and the gas fee hit a low of less than 10 Gwei. In this situation, an NFT project named Goblintown came into sight and brought ‘end times fun’ to free-to-mint NFTs. As a free-to-mint NFT, Goblintown had seen its floor price reaching a peak of 8 ETH and stabling around 3 ETH until now. With all kinds of fake Goblins springing up, Goblintown has created its own dynasty during the end of bull market.\n\n![2022年5月ETH行情](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P_3k8lqXPDjkJQt3lt47i.png?height=473&width=831)\n\n![Goblintown成交价走势图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C6DTAuiVRpm4SVtZNUzcq.png?height=502&width=1198)\n\n## 2.项目简介 Project Introduction\n\n项目官网 Official Website：\n\n[https://goblintown.wtf/](https://goblintown.wtf/)\n\n项目推特 OfficialTwitter：\n\n[https://twitter.com/goblintownwtf](https://twitter.com/goblintownwtf)\n\n官方Discord Project Discord：无\n\n推特粉丝 Twitter Followers：12.3万\n\n首条推文时间 First Tweet Date：2022年5月16日\n\n发售时间 Launch Date：2022年5月21日\n\n合约类型 Contract Type：ERC-721A\n\n供应总量 Total Supply：9999个\n\n铸造价格 Mint Price：free mint\n\n## 3.项目分析 Project Analysis\n\n### 3.1 项目画风 Art Style\n\n在Goblin之前，NFT的主流画风是AZUKI这样的精致唯美，或是Doodles这样的可爱风。而Goblin一反常态，一个个满嘴脏话的Goblin小人长得丑陋怪异，像极了指环王中的兽人闯进了精灵世界中。\n\n不过话说回来，Goblin虽然画风怪异，但是细看之下，可以发现其实它的元素非常的多，每个Goblin都丑的各有特色。可以说虽然画风与主流审美相悖，但是在艺术创作上其实是下足了功夫的。\n\n项目推特上的Goblin风格的文字也十分的令人印象深刻，大大小小的字母，错别字、粗口比比皆是。完美契合了Goblin小人的形象气质。\n\n可以说，Goblin项目的画风在当时的NFT市场独树一帜，丑陋但是辨识度极高，有利于资本的炒作。\n\nThe trending art style of NFT projects used to be aesthetic and delicate such as that of Azuki, or as cute as Doodles, until the appearance of foul-mouthed and disgusting Goblins. Just like orcs breaking into the world of elves.\n\nAnyway, although the Goblin style tends to be monstrous, the high level of detail in the Goblin artwork offers every Goblin its own distinct characteristics. Considerable effort has been devoted to the artistic creation which stands opposite to the mainstream of NFT.\n\nThe official tweets are very impressive with a mix of small and big text letters, misspelt words and foul languages, but they fit well with the style of Goblins.\n\nTo summarize, the art style of Goblintown is ugly but highly recognizable. This makes Goblintown project really unique for the NFT market at that moment and being continuously hyped.\n\n![Doodles画风](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lun17O9GWkAru3D5-U9Q4.png?height=258&width=276)\n\n![AZUKI画风](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cIqijE78_NGE39ofNMEmc.png?height=268&width=279)\n\n![Goblintown画风](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XnwaAbMxJO0hK9gsvWVo3.png?height=278&width=281)\n\n### 3.2 项目营销 Marketing\n\n5月16日项目方发布了第一条推特，当时并没有引起太多人关注。5月21日，项目开始发售，没有白名单，直接公售，单笔可以Mint一个。开始发售后一个小时内售罄，速度一般，没有Gas War（主要也是受到当时的市场环境影响）。\n\n项目售罄后，项目方开始搞事了。首先是yugalabs的大v出来模糊其词，暗示Goblin是yugalabs孵化的项目。然后很有意思的是，Goblin项目方又跳出来否认，称他们是Goobin而不是Munkee，语气非常的狂妄。\n\n在当时以太坊暴跌、大家纷纷持币观望的市场环境下，一直缺少一个爆点供资金来炒作。这样两条推文瞬间点燃了市场情绪，大家纷纷入场，Goblin地板价水涨船高，并冲上了交易榜首位。\n\n紧接着，项目方在5月22日召开了第一次推特Space。对于这样一个没有RoadMap、没有Discord的项目来说，Space的召开非常重要。与其说是开Space，其实是给Goblin Holders开了一个狂欢party，让市场的FOMO情绪进一步发酵。\n\n紧接着，在项目方的推波助澜下，粉丝们自发在推特上上传一些Goblin有关的趣事，包括Cosplay、制作周边等，把Goblin的市场热度推向了高潮。\n\nThe first tweet was posted on 16th of May. It did not attract much attention at the beginning. The project was launched on 21th of May with no pre-sale, and only 1 Goblin can be minted per transaction during public sale. It was sold out in less than one hour after launching without a gas war. The public sale is of a medium speed, partly due to the huge market drop at that time.\n\nShortly after selling out, rumors flew about Yuga labs being behind the collection. One of the founders of Yuga labs hinted on twitter that Goblintown was Yuga labs’s secret project. Interestingly, Goblin team denied the affiliation and claimed that they are Goobin not Munkee in an arrogant way.\n\nAt that moment, the ETH price had been rapidly declining. People were sitting on cash and waiting for a better buying opportunity. These 2 tweets pushed people onto hype immediately, resulting in a rocketed floor price and number 1 ranking spot on secondary sales.\n\nThe first twitter space was held on 22th of May. This is so important for an NFT project with no roadmap and no discord. The space turned into a carnival party for Goblin holders, while giving the others a sense of FOMO in the secondary market.\n\nAfter that, the Goblin fans became highly engaged all across the twitter by making fun of themselves with cosplay, derivatives, etc. This, in return, added fuel to the fire of Goblintown project.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4V_CGKuKAUdWf__UpMMcd.png?height=504&width=589)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KC98dxLoo-7O13rHko_Po.png?height=623&width=527)\n\n### 3.3 项目持有者 NFT Owners\n\n![Goblintown持有者分布情况](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8RV6rRvS0QW6N9WLNwPc.png?height=837&width=1300)\n\n作为一个总量9999的NFT项目，目前的持有者数量是4484个，筹码相对比较分散。其中，蓝筹持有者高达1590个，而BAYC+MAYC的持有者就有757个之多。蓝筹持有者相对而言都是钻石手，在项目拉盘的过程中不会轻易的出货。加之项目的筹码比较分散，不容易出现有人一直砸地板的现象。\n\nFor a project with a collection of 9999 NFTs, having 4484 unique owners indicates a distributed ownership. The amount of blue chip owners are up to 1590, among which 757 owners are holders of BAYC/MAYC. Those blue chip holders are more likely to hold the Goblins with diamond hands during the rising of Goblin’s floor price. In combination with the distributed ownership of this project, there is little chance that owners keep breaking the floor.\n\n![Goblintown挂单情况](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0enyUCxOKcBfgtvSyI-Qd.png?height=152&width=758)\n\n![Goblintown地板深度](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nAm7B7Ws6A1D4wPZ5gnVA.png?height=367&width=679)\n\n目前挂单数量为582个，挂单率5.82%。大部分挂单集中在7.4e以上，地板较薄。换句话说，项目的持有者共识度比较高，有利于项目的操盘。持有者的共识度高也是Goblin作为一个Free Mint项目，地板能够一直稳定在3e左右的原因。\n\n总的来说，项目持有者蓝筹率高，挂单量少，是Goblin项目在二级市场地板价稳定在3e左右的主要原因。\n\nThere are 582 items being listed for now, accounting for 5.82% of total collections. Most of them are listed above 7.4 ETH. The thin floors indicate strong consensus among owners, which makes it easy to control the floor price of the project. The strong consensus among owners is actually the key to the steady 3 ETH floor price of Goblintown.\n\nOverall, the high percent of blue chip owners and low percent of listed are the reason why Gobli’'s floor is holding steady on the secondary market.\n\n### 3.4 项目仿盘 Derivatives\n\n随着Goblintown项目的赚钱效应凸显，一大批仿盘项目如雨后春笋般涌现出来。诸如Goblin Women、Goblin Kidz、Goblin Catz、Goblin Land，基本上把Goblin小丑人的老婆孩子宠物还有房产都给配齐了。但是仿盘在画风、元素多样性、营销等方面和Goblintown多少还是有些差距，基本上热度都不会持续太久。反而Goblintown在这些仿盘的衬托下，一直延续着惊人的热度。\n\n一方面，Goblintown的大热带动仿盘项目纷纷前来分一杯羹。另一方面，仿盘项目又化作燃料，给Goblintown持续输出动力。\n\n## 4.项目总结\n\n总的来说，Goblintown项目有以下的优点：\n\n1. 作品风格强烈，元素饱满\n2. 营销手段突出，持续做事\n3. 持有者质量高，共同护盘\n4. 仿盘源源不断，持续添柴\n\n   这些因素综合起来，造就了牛尾熊初背景下，Goblin生态的狂欢盛宴。", "timestamp": 1658783651, "digest": "pEH0BQHUCfAj2gFcV0f_dPq1qsCUrer5wjxwQ-EEr9U", "contributor": "0xA8D33Fa0687d50606b44A4744ad5E8Ff314a20e9"}

Basically, all the goblin families, goblin pets along with their houses have shown up in NFT marketplace. Most of the derivatives will fail soon due to lack of art style quality, variety of traits and marketing. Anyway, Goblintown kept on fire against all these derivatives.\n\nOn the one hand, the success of Goblintown brought all those derivatives. On the other hand, all those derivatives had pushed the trading of Goblintown to record highs.\n\n## 4.项目总结 Summary\n\n总的来说，Goblintown项目有以下的优点：\n\n1. 作品风格强烈，元素饱满\n2. 营销手段突出，持续做事\n3. 持有者质量高，共同护盘\n4. 仿盘源源不断，持续添柴\n\n   这些因素综合起来，造就了牛尾熊初背景下，Goblin生态的狂欢盛宴。\n\nIn conclusion, the main advantages of Goblintown are listed as below:\n\n1.

The market cooled down a lot and the gas fee hit a low of less than 10 Gwei. In this situation, an NFT project named Goblintown came into sight and brought ‘end times fun’ to free-to-mint NFTs. As a free-to-mint NFT, Goblintown had seen its floor price reaching a peak of 8 ETH and stabling around 3 ETH until now. With all kinds of fake Goblins springing up, Goblintown has created its own dynasty during the end of bull market.\n\n![2022年5月ETH行情](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P_3k8lqXPDjkJQt3lt47i.png?height=473&width=831)\n\n![Goblintown成交价走势图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C6DTAuiVRpm4SVtZNUzcq.png?height=502&width=1198)\n\n## 2.项目简介 Project Introduction\n\n项目官网 Official Website：\n\n[https://goblintown.wtf/](https://goblintown.wtf/)\n\n项目推特 OfficialTwitter：\n\n[https://twitter.com/goblintownwtf](https://twitter.com/goblintownwtf)\n\n官方Discord Project Discord：无\n\n推特粉丝 Twitter Followers：12.3万\n\n首条推文时间 First Tweet Date：2022年5月16日\n\n发售时间 Launch Date：2022年5月21日\n\n合约类型 Contract Type：ERC-721A\n\n供应总量 Total Supply：9999个\n\n铸造价格 Mint Price：free mint\n\n## 3.项目分析 Project Analysis\n\n### 3.1 项目画风 Art Style\n\n在Goblin之前，NFT的主流画风是AZUKI这样的精致唯美，或是Doodles这样的可爱风。而Goblin一反常态，一个个满嘴脏话的Goblin小人长得丑陋怪异，像极了指环王中的兽人闯进了精灵世界中。\n\n不过话说回来，Goblin虽然画风怪异，但是细看之下，可以发现其实它的元素非常的多，每个Goblin都丑的各有特色。可以说虽然画风与主流审美相悖，但是在艺术创作上其实是下足了功夫的。\n\n项目推特上的Goblin风格的文字也十分的令人印象深刻，大大小小的字母，错别字、粗口比比皆是。完美契合了Goblin小人的形象气质。\n\n可以说，Goblin项目的画风在当时的NFT市场独树一帜，丑陋但是辨识度极高，有利于资本的炒作。\n\nThe trending art style of NFT projects used to be aesthetic and delicate such as that of Azuki, or as cute as Doodles, until the appearance of foul-mouthed and disgusting Goblins. Just like orcs breaking into the world of elves.\n\nAnyway, although the Goblin style tends to be monstrous, the high level of detail in the Goblin artwork offers every Goblin its own distinct characteristics. Considerable effort has been devoted to the artistic creation which stands opposite to the mainstream of NFT.\n\nThe official tweets are very impressive with a mix of small and big text letters, misspelt words and foul languages, but they fit well with the style of Goblins.\n\nTo summarize, the art style of Goblintown is ugly but highly recognizable. This makes Goblintown project really unique for the NFT market at that moment and being continuously hyped.\n\n![Doodles画风](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lun17O9GWkAru3D5-U9Q4.png?height=258&width=276)\n\n![AZUKI画风](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cIqijE78_NGE39ofNMEmc.png?height=268&width=279)\n\n![Goblintown画风](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XnwaAbMxJO0hK9gsvWVo3.png?height=278&width=281)\n\n### 3.2 项目营销 Marketing\n\n5月16日项目方发布了第一条推特，当时并没有引起太多人关注。5月21日，项目开始发售，没有白名单，直接公售，单笔可以Mint一个。开始发售后一个小时内售罄，速度一般，没有Gas War（主要也是受到当时的市场环境影响）。\n\n项目售罄后，项目方开始搞事了。首先是yugalabs的大v出来模糊其词，暗示Goblin是yugalabs孵化的项目。然后很有意思的是，Goblin项目方又跳出来否认，称他们是Goobin而不是Munkee，语气非常的狂妄。\n\n在当时以太坊暴跌、大家纷纷持币观望的市场环境下，一直缺少一个爆点供资金来炒作。这样两条推文瞬间点燃了市场情绪，大家纷纷入场，Goblin地板价水涨船高，并冲上了交易榜首位。\n\n紧接着，项目方在5月22日召开了第一次推特Space。对于这样一个没有RoadMap、没有Discord的项目来说，Space的召开非常重要。与其说是开Space，其实是给Goblin Holders开了一个狂欢party，让市场的FOMO情绪进一步发酵。\n\n紧接着，在项目方的推波助澜下，粉丝们自发在推特上上传一些Goblin有关的趣事，包括Cosplay、制作周边等，把Goblin的市场热度推向了高潮。\n\nThe first tweet was posted on 16th of May. It did not attract much attention at the beginning. The project was launched on 21th of May with no pre-sale, and only 1 Goblin can be minted per transaction during public sale. It was sold out in less than one hour after launching without a gas war. The public sale is of a medium speed, partly due to the huge market drop at that time.\n\nShortly after selling out, rumors flew about Yuga labs being behind the collection. One of the founders of Yuga labs hinted on twitter that Goblintown was Yuga labs’s secret project. Interestingly, Goblin team denied the affiliation and claimed that they are Goobin not Munkee in an arrogant way.\n\nAt that moment, the ETH price had been rapidly declining. People were sitting on cash and waiting for a better buying opportunity. These 2 tweets pushed people onto hype immediately, resulting in a rocketed floor price and number 1 ranking spot on secondary sales.\n\nThe first twitter space was held on 22th of May. This is so important for an NFT project with no roadmap and no discord. The space turned into a carnival party for Goblin holders, while giving the others a sense of FOMO in the secondary market.\n\nAfter that, the Goblin fans became highly engaged all across the twitter by making fun of themselves with cosplay, derivatives, etc. This, in return, added fuel to the fire of Goblintown project.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4V_CGKuKAUdWf__UpMMcd.png?height=504&width=589)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KC98dxLoo-7O13rHko_Po.png?height=623&width=527)\n\n### 3.3 项目持有者 NFT Owners\n\n![Goblintown持有者分布情况](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8RV6rRvS0QW6N9WLNwPc.png?height=837&width=1300)\n\n作为一个总量9999的NFT项目，目前的持有者数量是4484个，筹码相对比较分散。其中，蓝筹持有者高达1590个，而BAYC+MAYC的持有者就有757个之多。蓝筹持有者相对而言都是钻石手，在项目拉盘的过程中不会轻易的出货。加之项目的筹码比较分散，不容易出现有人一直砸地板的现象。\n\nFor a project with a collection of 9999 NFTs, having 4484 unique owners indicates a distributed ownership. The amount of blue chip owners are up to 1590, among which 757 owners are holders of BAYC/MAYC. Those blue chip holders are more likely to hold the Goblins with diamond hands during the rising of Goblin’s floor price. In combination with the distributed ownership of this project, there is little chance that owners keep breaking the floor.\n\n![Goblintown挂单情况](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0enyUCxOKcBfgtvSyI-Qd.png?height=152&width=758)\n\n![Goblintown地板深度](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nAm7B7Ws6A1D4wPZ5gnVA.png?height=367&width=679)\n\n目前挂单数量为582个，挂单率5.82%。大部分挂单集中在7.4e以上，地板较薄。换句话说，项目的持有者共识度比较高，有利于项目的操盘。持有者的共识度高也是Goblin作为一个Free Mint项目，地板能够一直稳定在3e左右的原因。\n\n总的来说，项目持有者蓝筹率高，挂单量少，是Goblin项目在二级市场地板价稳定在3e左右的主要原因。\n\nThere are 582 items being listed for now, accounting for 5.82% of total collections. Most of them are listed above 7.4 ETH. The thin floors indicate strong consensus among owners, which makes it easy to control the floor price of the project. The strong consensus among owners is actually the key to the steady 3 ETH floor price of Goblintown.\n\nOverall, the high percent of blue chip owners and low percent of listed are the reason why Gobli’'s floor is holding steady on the secondary market.\n\n### 3.4 项目仿盘 Derivatives\n\n随着Goblintown项目的赚钱效应凸显，一大批仿盘项目如雨后春笋般涌现出来。诸如Goblin Women、Goblin Kidz、Goblin Catz、Goblin Land，基本上把Goblin小丑人的老婆孩子宠物还有房产都给配齐了。但是仿盘在画风、元素多样性、营销等方面和Goblintown多少还是有些差距，基本上热度都不会持续太久。反而Goblintown在这些仿盘的衬托下，一直延续着惊人的热度。\n\n一方面，Goblintown的大热带动仿盘项目纷纷前来分一杯羹。另一方面，仿盘项目又化作燃料，给Goblintown持续输出动力。\n\nGoblintown, with the ability to make money in bear market, has spawned tons of derivatives including Goblin Women, Goblin Kidz, Goblin Catz and Goblin Land. Basically, all the goblin families, goblin pets along with their houses have shown up in NFT marketplace. Most of the derivatives will fail soon due to lack of art style quality, variety of traits and marketing. Anyway, Goblintown kept on fire against all these derivatives.\n\nOn the one hand, the success of Goblintown brought all those derivatives. On the other hand, all those derivatives had pushed the trading of Goblintown to record highs.\n\n## 4.项目总结 Summary\n\n总的来说，Goblintown项目有以下的优点：\n\n1. 作品风格强烈，元素饱满\n2. 营销手段突出，持续做事\n3. 持有者质量高，共同护盘\n4. 仿盘源源不断，持续添柴\n\n   这些因素综合起来，造就了牛尾熊初背景下，Goblin生态的狂欢盛宴。\n\nIn conclusion, the main advantages of Goblintown are listed as below:\n\n1. Impressive art style with various traits.\n2. Great marketing skills and continuous output.\n3. Diamond hand owners keeping the floor price steady.\n4. Numerous derivatives keeping Goblintown on fire.\n   \n\n   The combination of these factors has contributed to all the hypes with Goblintown NFT and its derivatives at the start of bear markets.", "timestamp": 1658787448, "digest": "tD7MUB2827Z-CJk-WDdWqIeVVLnOFu-cR0DRYwri134", "contributor": "0xA8D33Fa0687d50606b44A4744ad5E8Ff314a20e9"}
