{"id": "N4WISA9E8rd69o34HG_TfK7TFqaHWIQBGbfd7JdPGSo", "title": "$ENIOLA 04: Building in a Bear Market", "body": "*Hey peeps, this is the first update post Launch House + NFT.NYC. Last month there was a focus on launching, launching and launching. For the most part, a unique blend of resources, connections and timelines were in-line to act as a launchpad for various projects (entrepreneurial and personal). It’s been well documented that current market conditions have put a spanner in the works for many start-ups, scale-ups and other builders. Some of my friends have lost the majority of their net worth, whilst others have now entered the job market. In these unprecedented times, the sentiment of many people on crypto Twitter is just to hunker down and build. But reality for the majority doesn’t allow for such basic and unthoughtful advice. All I can say is do what you can to get through the bear market. Get that job AND build, support your family AND build, take care of your body and mind AND build. To be comfortable building a startup in any market condition is some form of privilege in itself; something that builders and investors forget sometimes. Build if it makes sense. Do not be roped in by the simple platitudes you see online.*\n\nI think that’s my most extended introduction to any of my updates thus far → lets' dive in!\n\n### Month In Retrospect\n\n* I wrapped up a month in New York as part of Launch House, Founders House Summer 2022 Cohort (yes, it’s a long title). I had an amazing time there, built connections, had fun and learnt a lot. You can read [articles](https://eniola.mirror.xyz) and view [tweets](https://twitter.com/elijah_ajuwon/status/1528877678115586048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1528877678115586048%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Feniola.mirror.xyz%2FA2MwquHQCIlQtTEsTyHJpvtMcDORoeHaisy0a-ZEetw) about my experiences.\n* I attended NFT.NYC for the first time as well, it was a good conference with amazing speakers from the biggest VCs and founders of some of the biggest web3 startups. However, I found that there was more value in the satellite events and after-parties, for me personally. I think I may end up applying to speak at the conference next year.\n* A demo for early.fans can be viewed on our [notion wiki](https://earlyfans.notion.site/early-fans-wiki-7e45427b91d74f29b2889e11b4120386). There you can get to grips with the looks and feel of the first iteration of our MVP.\n* We started having meetings with VCs, from both the United Kingdom and States. As mentioned before this is a numbers game. Each VC has different theses and methods. I have received varying advice from the firms; some of which conflicting but it’s important to build with users, make sure there’s a market and get some early traction. Someone will eventually take the first leap.\n* There were no proposals for $ENIOLA holders to vote on this month. Monthly proposals will make a come-back.\n\n### Biggest Takeaways\n\n* Right now I am unwavering. Even with these market conditions and personal circumstances, my first thought is what can I do to continue building. Do I get a job? Do I split the raise? Who do I partner with or reach out to? Should I relocate? My game plan may have changed but the goal hasn’t.\n* I want to feel small again. When I was in New York, I was constantly being reminded of how unremarkable and small I was. Now I know the language is dramatic and don’t worry I am not going through a quarter-life or identity crisis, it is just impossible for me to be comfortable with my achievements or goals. Some of my peers are doing amazing things. I know that comparison is the death of joy, but I what I took from this was the difference in my personal mentality and drive when around a certain type of individual. \n\n### What’s Next\n\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n\n*To view the redacted content please buy some $ENIOLA you can reach out to me or buy it on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet).*\n\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nTo the builders (in whatever capacity) reading this,c sondier your environment. When this type of discourse happens people typically focus on their friends and WHO they are surrounded by. However, what is equally important is WHAT are you surrounded by. What resources do you have access to? What infrastructure has been set up in your location? What ecosystems are you plugged into? The whats are as equally important as the whys.", "timestamp": 1659034956, "digest": "d3RTD4bbrAJZ1QZzCFnuZpQYhvcWujabklEYi4o6t-0", "contributor": "0xE314f925f05c8f5e4063Dd19684992196f5d89D9"}
{"id": "GQcOI9zqyI7sps8NdG6wS5LP_oqGjAXODpgqy2ZIOLw", "title": "Deploy your first smart contract to distribute your video on blockchain", "body": "Share is a protocol and dApp built on blockchain that enables creators to choose the price per stream of their audio or video content, distribute the content directly to consumers, make it accessible on any web application, and receive payments instantly when their content is streamed. Share has a wide variety of applications including music, video, and podcasts.\n\n*This article overviews the process to **deploy a VIDEO on blockchain with SHARE** and provides example information that you can use to test out the process.*\n\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIn the *[Share User Guide](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-user-guide)* you can find the general requirements to use Share. This includes [selecting and setting up a Web3 wallet](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-pre-release-user-guide/select-and-setup-a-wallet) and [connecting to the Share dApp](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-user-guide/connect-to-the-dapp). If you haven’t already and are not familiar with some of the Web3 terminology and technology, please make sure you visit these sections and learn about what you’ll need to interact with Share.\n\n## Upload your video file and create a smart contract\n\n 1. **Video file.** Prepare a video file in MP4 format. MP4 is the most popular format for digital video. If you don't already have a video that you want to use for testing, you can use this [demo MP4 video](https://formless-eng.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/share-testvideo.mp4).\n 2. **Website location.** Navigate to <https://share.formless.xyz/create> in your web browser. Here you’ll see a series of steps where you will input information that is used to create the details of your smart contract.\n 3. **Creator Name.** Enter \"My Test Name\". This is the name you use to identify yourself, e.g. your artist name or your real name. This can be anything you choose, for example, you can do things like \"KANYE X JAY-Z\" if you'd like to list multiple names. Your content ownership is uniquely identified through your blockchain address, not the name entered here.\n 4. **Title.** Enter \"My Test Video Title\". Similar to the name field, this can be anything you want. The content will be uniquely identified using its smart contract address. This title is purely for display purposes.\n 5. **Upload.** Select \"Choose File\" and locate the test video MP4 file that we prepared above.\n 6. **Artwork and previews.** Select “Custom Artwork” and upload an image file that meets the file type and size requirements identified on screen. This image will appear as a thumbnail and as a screen cap on your video. Select “Custom Video Preview” and upload a video file that represent a segment of your full video content and meets the file type and size requirements identified on screen. Users will be able to play this content prior to purchasing access to your content. If your content is free, there’s no need to add the Custom Video preview since all of your content will play for free. \n 7. **Royalty Splits.** You’ll see your wallet address auto-populated in the Primary Owner field. When you start uploading content that has multiple creators, you can select the “Split Royalties” box, add addresses of other owners, identify their proportional share of royalties, and they’ll also be added as content owners in your smart contract. For now, keep this unchecked and proceed with yourself as the single owner of the content. This means revenues will flow to your address when the content is viewed.\n 8. **Price For Access.** Enter “0.25”. This means that viewers will need to pay 25 cents to watch your new video. The payment won't require them to enter any financial information, it will automatically flow from their wallet on the blockchain seamlessly. In this example, we're using 25 cents, but the beauty of Share is that you can set this value to be anything that you want. It can be 0 for free content, or any amount you wish, even $1M if that's what you think it's worth. You know your audience and the worth of your content better than we ever could.\n 9. **Apple and Google Pay.** Select “Enable Apple and Google Pay”. This will allow consumers to purchase access to your content using Apple Pay and Google Pay, and they won’t need to connect a Web3 wallet in order to purchase access to your content. This is an optional feature and is only available for content that is priced equal to or above 17 cents. There are a few additional fees ($.30 + 7.9% of the transaction value) that consumers will have to pay for the convenience of using Apple or Google Pay, but depending on your use case and how you’re pricing your content it may make sense.\n10. **Access Grant Time.** Enter 1 DAY, 0 HOURS, 0 MINUTES. This is the amount of time that the viewer will have access to your content after they complete the instant micro-payment. This is also completely up to you. For example, you can set this to be 5 minutes or 5 months. Each time the content is viewed, Share will check the blockchain to see if the viewer still has access. Once the time is up, they'll need to pay again to experience the content.\n11. **Blockchain.** You’ll see \"Polygon Mainnet” auto-populated in the Blockchain field. This is the blockchain that we're going to use to store the contract for the content. As we noted earlier, we're using Polygon because it is fast, inexpensive, and fully compatible with Ethereum. \n12. **Cloud.** This is the backend infrastructure platform used to serve the content file globally. GCP is the default value, but this will be configurable such that you can specify your own server in the future if you'd like to. Please read the [Terms of Service](https://formless.xyz/terms) (ToS) with regard to hosting uploaded content. Share does not have the ability to modify or revoke smart contract assets deployed through the service, however we reserve the right to suspend content *hosting* associated with these contracts. This means if your contract violates the ToS, we will not serve the associated content, and it is your responsibility to update your deployed smart contract with a new URI which points to a Share protocol compliant host.\n13. **Review.** This displays the amount that it will cost to create and deploy the contract to blockchain. You’ll need to have at least this amount of MATIC tokens in your wallet for the transaction to process.\n14. **Deploy.** Select “Create”.  This will create your smart contract. You’ll see a message in your wallet asking you to verify the transaction. Once you’ve verified your transaction will process and result in your smart contract deployed on the blockchain. \n15. **Completion.** Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed a smart contract on blockchain that is ready for distribution. You can select the link to view your content, or you can copy/past the link to share it with potential customers. \n16. **More.** Read about how you can [Send text messages with smart contract links](https://placholder).\n\n\n---\n\nWant more detail?

This project is the first time a decentralized automation protocol for NFTs and blockchain games has been deployed.\n\nThe game integrates multiple automation features to achieve [autonomous NFTs (aNFTs)](https://mirror.xyz/0x6B87AbC02Fc4E2406219C69ecE0280ca39476b31/6wGjQ-Saz4YUISqx3oXS1tQXLLOdXaC_WfFYKlqoq-Y), and for the first time, on-chain non-playable characters (NPCs). aNFTs are an iteration of NFTs that have the ability to vote, fund, and even transfer themselves thanks to the automation capabilities of the Autonomy protocol. MetaDungeon is also the first blockchain game that requires players to be collaborative and rely on team mechanics, incorporating other NFT projects which players own as an essential part of gameplay.\n\n\"The vast majority of characters in Web2 games like Cyberpunk 2077 or World of Warcraft are NPCs that interact with each other or the player independently,” says James Key, Founder and CEO of Autonomy. “Through the development of aNFTs, it is now possible to build these types of engaging characters a blockchains. This represents a watershed moment for blockchain gaming and metaverses to build the types of games that generations of gamers are familiar with, and vastly expand the variety of games that can be built on blockchains.\"\n\n## How to participate in MetaDungeon\n\nThe MetaDungeon game consists of Heroes and Bosses, where all Bosses are aNFTs and each player is a Hero NFT. Heroes team up to fight world Bosses (aNFTs) and score loot worth real money. Players interact with 3 sets of NFTs: Heroes, the players in the game; Bosses, who the Heroes fight; and Gear, the unique items that Bosses drop. Players have the opportunity to earn loot from killing each Boss in the form of NFTs and tokens, which a Boss holds. Holding a Player NFT and defeating a boss is all that’s needed to receive loot.\n\nPlayers will be able to obtain a Hero NFT via the Genesis Drop, which will happen in three phases.\n\n* Phase one: Sign up for the [mintlist form](https://form.typeform.com/to/u2RioRYq?typeform-source=blog.autonomynetwork.io) to secure guaranteed access to mint at least one Hero on August 9, 2022.\n* Phase two: Allowlisted communities (who already hold certain yet-to-be-revealed NFTs) will have a chance to mint an NFT on August 10, 2022, on a first come first serve basis.\n* Phase three: There may be a Hero NFT public sale down the line during which anyone will be able to get their hands on the remaining collection of Hero NFTs – if there are any left standing.", "timestamp": 1659036364, "digest": "ATUviwtf37WV2sCcZnHoUCJ7GBUVF1Kza6P2HTLqeoE", "contributor": "0x9C00Beae824b9f7eD84704012f3d245992F81601"}

Approximately every 30 minutes, 10 validators are randomly chosen to run the network. Nodes (known as bundlers) are used to bundle multiple layer 2 transactions into a single Arweave (layer 1) transaction.\n\n# RUN A BUNDLR VALIDATOR ON TESTNET- JULY 2022\n\n[Bundlr Testnet](https://medium.com/bundlr-network/bundlr-launches-its-first-testnet-4bedd76e7c) is now live. You must use a domain or static IP, dynamic IPs will cause your validator to become undiscoverable. This guide is assuming a fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n\nHardware Specs:\n\n* Memory: 8 GB RAM\n* CPU: Quad-Core\n* Disk: 250 GB SSD Storage\n* Bandwidth: 1 Gbps for Download/100 Mbps for Upload\n\n## 1.

With the release of the Shimmer beta, projects will be pushing the limits of its features. With the following Shimmer mainnet, smart contract functionality, and a little bit of luck, we will see an explosion of dApps hurling themselves into the Shimmer universe.\n\nThe job of ecosystem development within the Iota Foundation is to make this bang as loud as possible.\n\nFor transparency, I thought I’d take a second to explain this effort and my involvement in it.\n\n*Note: everything here is from my own point of view and doesn’t necessarily reflect the opinions of other within the Iota Foundation or even in the Touchpoint crew. It’s also very much a joint effort and I’m just one of many trying to build the best ecosystem possible.*\n\n# A bit about myself\n\nAdam / [@Schpoopel](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel) here. My first interaction with cryptocurrency was installing — and subsequently forgetting — the Bitcoin mining software on my computer in 2010. I’m not sure it even fully synced to the network.\n\nIt wasn’t until 7 years later that I purchased my first bitcoin.\n\nDuring this time I was schlepping around the globe as an army aviation officer. After nearly a decade of this, I went back to university. Yet, this weird hobby with magic internet money kept pulling at my attention…\n\nI was keeping an ear to the themes of crypto, playing around in different ecosystems, trading my way up (…and down), minting NFTs, falling for the odd scam, and thinking about decentralization and the difference between innovation and vaporware. Eventually I gave in and focused on crypto full-time.\n\nMy first professional assignment in crypto was spent scribbling and designing educational courses for [ZeFi](https://zefi.com/en), which aims to bring crypto knowledge to the Arabic-speaking world. Luckily for me, their content is also in English (my Arabic doesn’t get much past *habibi*). During my tenure there, we wrote beginner courses on blockchain, smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs, while participating in talks on the social impacts of distributed ledger technology. I also traveled a bit to help spread the good word.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Schpoopel/status/1524764276413636609](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel/status/1524764276413636609)\n\nLater, I was fortunate enough to get picked up as an ecosystem developer by the Iota Foundation, which I’d followed since I initially drifted into the crypto space. The task at hand: contribute to a flourishing and robust universe of decentralized applications (dApps) built with Iota smart contracts.\n\n# “Ecosystem Developer”\n\nA job title as equally ambiguous in crypto discords as at family dinners (on par with “consultant”), one could be forgiven for assuming I’m either doing something for the environment or programming. While I enjoy those things, the job *instead* entails building up a network of applications that are usable, useful, economically sustainable, and even fun.\n\nSometimes this effort involves learning lessons from other protocols, e.g. when examining how Avalanche’s daily active users (DAUs) got up the slope (unaltered [source](https://messari.io/article/state-of-avalanche-q1-2022)):\n\n![I may have added too many red lines](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bwbS_Ik7sdkmzRJm0P7BW.png?height=511&width=914)\n\nAt other times, I’m reaching out to payment gateways (Simplex, Transak, etc.) to see how we can get a fiat-on ramp onto the native Firefly wallet.\n\nRegardless of the task — of which there are many — everything revolves around making Shimmer and Assembly as successful as possible. Perhaps nowhere is this effort more evident than in our open builder's program, Touchpoint.\n\n# Builders. Investors. Experts.\n\nTouchpoint was designed late last year and officially [announced](https://blog.assembly.sc/introducing-touchpoint/) in March 2022. A product of [Dan](https://twitter.com/DanSimerman), [Corey](https://twitter.com/CoreyST_), and [Christian](https://twitter.com/christiansaur2), the vision was to create a dedicated space for builders to work together while getting hands-on support from the IF and connect to investors. You can think of it as a mix between being a cohort-based accelerator (a la Y-Combinator) and an ecosystem hub. Such a space, involving recent multichain converts and pioneers of Iota tech alike, allows us to find and remove common obstacles between the projects.\n\nOur “hands on support” can take the form of introducing projects to potential partner dApps, investors, or a slew of experts ranging from product designers to code auditors. We’ve even met up personally with some of these projects at Iota meetups and at the Berlin office to talk through their roadmaps.\n\nSome other activities that have gone on in Touchpoint are:\n\n* **Networking**: We made connections with law firms and smart contract auditors, to find cost-effective solutions for project teams. Projects have also coordinated among themselves and with IF members on ideas for e.g. DeFi educational platforms.\n* **Fundraising**: We advised projects on their fundraising strategies (developers don’t work for free after all…), discussed valuations, and reviewed a hefty stack of pitch decks.\n* **Communications**: Suz ran an excellent communications workshop, and the projects have since had 1:1 assistance with her on their their comms strategy. We’ve also helped them gain exposure via blog articles and retweets.\n* **Product studio**: The Iota design studios held a community call and worked individually with UI / UX / product strategy among the projects.\n* **Technical Support**: Ani, our developer advocate, and some from the Iota Smart Contract team have been in close contact with many of the projects in the discord, allowing them to prepare their dApps for deployment.\n\nIn these aspects, Touchpoint is unique in the crypto space; we simply do not find this level of support, open communications, and networking in other ecosystems (…we asked around).\n\nThis is also a lot of work! Christian has the honor of managing **over one-hundred-fifty channels in the discord**… This spans around 50 groups, all of which are at different developmental stages (from ideation to launch). Besides the general chat rooms, there are chats with each project, investor, expert, and matchmaking channels where we introduce projects to each other. You know all those “we at \\[X\\] are proud to announce a partnership with \\[Y\\]”? You can thank him for some of those.\n\nThis isn’t to mention the telegram groups we facilitate between, say, a project and an outside auditing firm. Lastly, there’s the screening, which involves 30 minute calls with the projects to make sure they are seriously building something relevant for the ecosystem. Multiply this by 200 applicants, and our time gets filled up very fast.\n\nBecause of that, we expanded the team. Even while many VCs went “risk-off” with their capital and tech layoffs abound, the Touchpoint team took me on board in February. More recently, [Austin](https://twitter.com/bandalof17) joined up as has been focusing on outreach into other ecosystems. If you need a reason to be optimistic about how seriously we take Shimmer, here you go.\n\n# The State of the DAppspace\n\nMeanwhile, teams have had their heads down in development mode. Even as the IF fine tunes the Shimmer mainnet, many projects have claimed a piece of this universe for themselves. These include DEXs, wallets with in-app payments, lending protocols, yield aggregators, metaverses, meme projects, domain name services, NFT marketplaces, launchpads, DAOs, infrastructure projects on the level of Alchemy/Infura, real-world asset platforms, and games. The full list can be found [here](https://shimmer.network/ecosystem).\n\n*I should note that not all of these projects are working with Touchpoint. This is of course ok! If a project team wants to go on their own and not be a part of Touchpoint, more power to them. But we’re here if you need us. :)*\n\n![Shimmer on, you crazy diamonds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eyoFS6YItMn2IZzn-1hFn.png?height=537&width=813)\n\nIt is not only dApps that are popping up. We also have [seriously](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj013MZSgIOlUdi9Mzx51mw) [informative ](https://open.spotify.com/show/387nS9czdx47kJZ6Mho28m)[and](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0Tr-pPipB-dg0ISaiUlIw) [funny](https://www.youtube.com/c/SpecWeekly) content producers spicing the place up (and this is only the English content!). Thanks to these creators, our message is starting to build and propagate. People are becoming aware about feeless native assets & NFTs on the layer 1, unchained liquidity between layers and smart contract chains, and our composable architecture.\n\n# Going Forward\n\nIs that all? Well, no, we are also in looking into bringing oracles, bridges, indexers, stablecoins, block explorers, blue-chip dApps, and multi-signature wallets into the ecosystem. I can’t spoil anything here, but I can say that some of these conversations are already months in the making.\n\nWithin the Touchpoint program, we are working to source more funding for projects. One of our biggest challenges has been to get capital flowing to projects during a year when 2/3 of the crypto market dried up. Fear not! We are connecting with more investors, and converting older connections to the Shimmer vision.\n\nTouchpoint will increasingly leverage its role as a coordinator to host events within the server, as well as helping the project teams broadcast their events outside of it. From these, the community can expect more talks, demos, and generally more awareness for the dApps and the ecosystem at large.\n\nWill it all be enough to outshine (✨outshimmer?✨) the [hundreds](https://chainlist.org/) of EVM-compatible networks in existence? We’re doing all we can on that front, but part of this relies on you too, dear reader. Here’s how to get involved:\n\n* coordinate meetups / Stammtische and invite your favorite IF member\n* get involved on the [Iota Governance Forum](https://govern.iota.org/)\n* vote in Firefly\n* [apply](https://airtable.com/shrxW5Fs6NGDOkkBv) for Touchpoint\n* register your project on the [ecosystem page](https://shimmer.network/ecosystem)\n* listen out for the community calendar\n* follow [any](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel) [of](https://twitter.com/DanSimerman) [us](https://twitter.com/CoreyST_) [on](https://twitter.com/christiansaur2) [twitter](https://twitter.com/bandalof17) (or [on](https://medium.com/@christiansaur) [medium](https://simerman.medium.com/))\n* invite us to your twitter space, online event, podcast\n* keep building\n* don’t be a stranger\n\nFor my part, I will be available on discord and twitter. Feel free to ping me to talk ecosystem dev stuff! Perhaps you know of a project we should be looking at, or just want to know where our attention currently is.\n\nUntil next time, I hope this gives some insight as to what is going on behind the scenes and how we plan on making the biggest boom in the crypto space.\n\nMay all your *wen’s* be *soon*. \n - Adam", "timestamp": 1659037050, "digest": "rfur0bC0hIec1nn-pZrHBvkqF8Yh8wlB0cXsRmHm7U0", "contributor": "0x654D34445eb7fe967aA95aAFC0C614592F43a33e"}

The Accelerator is the entry point to the network, and we’re so excited to welcome the next cohort of innovators to the Club.\n\n### The Network as Seed Club’s “Secret Sauce”\n\nTokens give communities superpowers. As we discover these superpowers, we need high-signal and agile sensemaking networks to navigate crypto’s high-velocity innovation. Seed Club’s defining asset is our unmatched network of alumni, collaborators, and contributors.\n\nThe network’s value was made clear during the emergent selection process for SC04, where over 65 alumni, collaborators, and contributors stood up the *[autonymous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autonymous#:\\~:text=Definition%20of%20autonymous,used%20of%20symbols%20and%20expressions)* TomaDAO: a working group assembled for the sole purpose of selecting the next great Accelerator cohort. While we put them in the Telegram group chat together, they identified that chat as a community - and gave it a name. \\[Why TomaDAO? Stay with us: Accelerator selection process → the network as Seed Club’s secret sauce → tomato sauce? → the “Rotten Tomatoes” of web3? → TomaDAO (🍅,🍅).\\]\n\n![TomaDAO Genesis ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fsf65zuqlpscTE6TpfrYt.png?height=1000&width=2000)\n\n**TomaDAO was an experiment in a community-driven selection process.** The selection committee engaged in the rigorous work of reviewing and vetting applications, curating a shortlist of applicants for $CLUB holders to vote on. Here’s what we learned from our first TomaDAO season:\n\n* Collaborators and alumni are eager to lean in.\n* Collaborators and alumni enjoy being in community. The emergent connections demonstrated the possibility for deeper community-building.\n* Our most effective selection mechanism to date is the thoughtful and nuanced application reviews provided by experienced builders.\n* There was information asymmetry between TomaDAO members and $CLUB holders, and we want to integrate $CLUB holders into the process earlier on.\n* We want more community members involved during the application review process, but how do we *thoughtfully* scale?\n\n### The Next Selection Experiment: $CLUB Holders, We’re Looking at You\n\n[After we closed SC04, we took an extended break](https://club.mirror.xyz/lNcmjU7u8y9oV0hSD1dUc9vqEWE0UcvBighIpVudG2U) to retro the Accelerator from end-to-end, including our selection process. Over the past three months, the Accelerator working group, in deep collaboration with the Product working group, left no stone unturned exploring ways to improve the selection process for SC05.\n\n![How It Started](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YGD1Kg9hvc4BEdloKPzhg.png?height=1356&width=2290)\n\nAfter multiple [feedback sessions and design jams](https://www.figma.com/file/brPs0D4gt7nCoUhYTvVghc/SC05-Selection-Process?node-id=0%3A1), our next experiment emerged – our internal Call to Adventure for the SC05 selection process: **scalable community selection mechanisms**. We arrived at two critical first principles:\n\n1. *DAO teams have the ability to engage with the community in real time as they review applications.* DAO teams want the ability to edit, access, and update their applications.\n2. *$CLUB holders have full visibility and engagement on applications.* The community participates in boosting and exploring all aspects of the DAO’s application to provide informed and thoughtful input. This addresses the previous information asymmetry between TomaDAO members and $CLUB holders.\n\nThe result of our break is a two-part improvement for SC05: a refreshed Accelerator experience (more info next week), and refined application and selection processes.\n\n### Enter: The Accelerator Portal\n\nOur TomaDAO selection committee is back for SC05, but this time with one crucial differentiator: **$CLUB holders now have the same level of application insight, with the ability to review and engage with applicants as they’re applying.** This is all made possible by The Accelerator Portal, which is intentionally built to serve both Accelerator applicants and the $CLUB community.\n\nHere are the key components of The Accelerator Portal and how it enables a scalable community-driven selection process:\n\n* **Visible & Comprehensive Applications:** The Portal allows applicants to build a more comprehensive profile, providing context to those who need it most: $CLUB holders, fellow applicants, TomaDAO members, and the Seed Club team.\n* **Application Discovery:** Submitting an application publishes it to the Portal. The Portal’s landing page provides a real-time view of the latest applicants. $CLUB holders discover and boost new applicants as they apply.\n* **Boosts & Comments:** Each applicant profile integrates boosts and comments. Boosts are a way to signal community excitement for potential cohort members. The comment section is a way for $CLUB holders to gather more information and/or send some love. Applicants respond to comments in real time, and make adjustments to their application if they choose.\n\n### Three-Phase Selection Process\n\nThe selection process for SC05 occurs over three phases:\n\n1. Phase 1: Applications - 8/1 to 8/15\n   1. Applications for SC05 open on August 1, submitted via The Portal. Applicants respond to comments in real time, and make adjustments to their application through August 15 if they choose.\n2. Phase 2: Community Input - 8/1 to 8/22\n   1. $CLUB holders and the Seed Club team review the applications as they’re submitted. Reviewers boost up to 20 applications and continue using the comment feature to ask clarifying questions and/or send some love.\n3. Phase 3: Interviews - 8/22 to 8/26\n   1. The TomaDAO selection committee creates a shortlist of the most promising applicants based on community input. These applicants advance to the interview round. Cohort acceptance letters go out on September 12, with the public announcement to follow.\n\n### Sensemake With Us\n\nEach time we run this process, our network grows, and becomes more interconnected, more opinionated and more engaged. The selection process is just the beginning of the long journey we commit to with each project we bring into Seed Club. **We are entrusting you, our community, with the responsibility of sharing thoughtful, constructive feedback and asking questions that help projects improve and tighten their applications.** We are eager to engage many of you in this next round of experiments, to learn from your insights, and to be inspired to find even more ways to engage and collaborate with you in the future.", "timestamp": 1659037226, "digest": "g2th0wiPrRVkv8dLp9CFfMBAjYN9gZi3gI2PmXrNg3Q", "contributor": "0x751077DfD4942aA28985bAA850f4C648d241C863"}
{"id": "ykalV51FEhTFmgoa6pYkBctpn8YOsETmNIfkY5D7Zhc", "title": "01. How to solve World Hunger in 30 days", "body": "**01.   World Hunger**\n\nSo, I want to talk about how I was tossing and turning in bed the other night, and what I was thinking during those brief moments of being on the line between awake or asleep as I flipped from sleeping on my side to my front, and probably back. What I was thinking, was about how to solve world hunger in a practical sense. One word popped out and stuck with me. The word is **redistribution**. If you’ve been incessantly thinking about how its absolutely crazy that at least 820 million people, and rising, are suffering from hunger that we call “world hunger”, and yet four times enough food to feed them just rots every year, please hit me up! I need a support group. I’m not coping well at all with this. I mean, the food just rots. Its not like anyone is evening making money off that rotting food, or am I mistaken? Packaged, untouched food. Anyway, that brings me back to redistribution. Come on this journey with me. At each level of a product’s lifecycle, the holder needs to know how much is too much. I don’t buy more food than I know I’ll eat, and that feels like common sense because why overdo it on purpose and happily throw food away? That’s weird and upsetting to me. And if I ever have food that I know I won’t finish or open, giving it away takes first priority. That’s the energy we need throughout the product chain. When shops overbuy stocks, the surplus can be redistributed within a good space of time. I’ve seen supermarkets still have crates of eggs on their shelves two days before the expiry date, and I honestly wonder what they do with all those eggs after no one buys them. Its clearly old stock and I feel they should’ve known they had too much and redistributed them to those in need. That’s the energy we need, and we need it to scale up to warehouses where the food is first stored in bulk before distribution. After the shops improve their orders to match their demand, leftover food will now be redistributable directly from the warehouses. The same way the food gets to supermarkets, is the same way it should get to the *foodmarkets* for these people in need. Give the people free food. The only reason they don’t have food is because it costs money and they’re not making enough of it, if any. We are living in a world where food is thrown away and people are left to starve. This redistribution solution is really easy to implement and mainly relies on the availability of transportation. Eradicating world hunger is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, so I’m sure a world hunger fund can more than pay for the transportation that will be required. That shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nAnd oh, I shouldn’t leave out the producers. Producers are a very important part of the product lifecycle. They are where it all begins. Production centres that are overproducing need to be identified and regulated accordingly, because overproducing to this degree is harmful to the global collective by depleting our finite water and land resources.\n\nOkay, that’s world hunger solved. People in supply chain management, a group of people knowledgeable on the geographic spread and respective degrees of hunger, and the UN, need to meet and hash out the technicalities. One month of dedicated effort and this is solved. Among us, we’ve got the expertise to make that happen. I don’t know how to get that message to them, but this feels like a good start and its very nice to have a clear and describable solution to present.\n\nWhat’s next on the solution stage, climate change? Ouuuu - that rhymed. I liked that.\n\n(If you would like to support me + my continued development of solutions and perhaps even their implementation, I would appreciate that.)", "timestamp": 1659036968, "digest": "ANWwfgCNIABf6197aWT3MipIBckBxEISi7pnV3jmuYI", "contributor": "0x37a46Af45325A05797D691a65283393bD84b33D8"}

Tam has appreciated users of the testnet version providing feedback and battle testing.\n\nJrocki read white paper and was one of the first in the discord\n\n**What are Putty and Cally?**\n\nPutty - options platform where you can buy and sell put options on NFTs and ERC 20 tokens.\nEnables you to hedge your risk and protect your downside for floor price dropping or token price dropping.\nFor example, if you have an NFT worth 1 eth, and are worried the price might drop, you could buy a put option for a small premium at a strike price of .5 eth for say 1 month. So, if the price of the NFT goes below 0.5 eth for the next month, you could exercise that option, and get 0.5 eth from whoever sold the option to you.\n\nCally - Cally is similar, but for call options instead of puts. enables you to selling covered calls on your NFTs by setting a specific duration and premium. Can be set based on a dutch option. If you set the parameters correctly, you can try to avoid being liquidated on your NFTs. Earn a premium on NFT by staking it in a vault and selling a call on it. You can ensure the other side of trade is far out of the money, so you can kind of earn yield.\n\nThey've done 50,000 worth of transactions. FloorDAO sold a bunch of puts to another organization that was wanting to protect themselves on the forgotten runes wizard cult NFT collection.\n\nIf you want to do something specific with Optimism tokens, reach out to Tam or jump in the Putty discord. They can help you find agreeable terms.\n\nFactors going into price / profit: Duration, strike price, volatility of the token / collection.\n\nVersion 2 of Putty will implement a model based on the Black-Scholes options pricing model, a mathematical method (using differential equations) to calculate the theoretical value of an option contract.\nThe Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility.\n\nThey are developing specifications for version 2.\n\nYou can create a generic floor NFT option. From on top of this, you could build an NFT index that tracks the prices of 5 different NFT collections.\nEnables structured financial products to be built on top of NFTs and ERC-20s, enabling inverstors easy access to ERC-20 and ERC-721 based derivatives.\nThis broadens and diversifies the type of financial portfolio that can be built in the realm of cryptocurrency.\n\nUse case for Putty: GameFI, users taking damage or health.

Its a way to avoid being liquidated on your NFTs, although there is still risk. \n\nUsers can seek to earn a premium on NFT by staking it in a vault and selling a call on it. \n\nPutty and Cally have done 50,000 worth of transactions. FloorDAO sold a bunch of puts to another organization that was wanting to protect themselves on the forgotten runes wizard cult NFT collection.\n\nLaunched in January and built in the Solidity programming language, Putty and Cally will both be on Ethereum mainnet and Optimism, although currently MVP stage.\n\nPutty and Cally were released testnet early in the development cycle - no gated or whitelist testnet required. Tam has appreciated users of the testnet version providing feedback and battle testing.\n\nIf you want to do something specific with Optimism tokens, reach out to Tam or jump in the Putty discord. They can help you find agreeable terms.\n\n**Putty Version 2:**\n\nThey are developing specifications for version 2.\n\nV2 of Putty will implement a model based on the [Black-Scholes options pricing model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp#:\\~:text=The%20Black%2DScholes%20model%2C%20aka,free%20rate%2C%20and%20the%20volatility.), a mathematical method (using differential equations) to calculate the theoretical value of an option contract.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model requires 5 inputs. These factors determine a user’s likelihood of turning a profit:\n\n* strike price of an option\n* current stock (or token) price\n* time to expiration (duration)\n* risk-free rate\n* volatility of the token of NFT collection\n\n**What can you do with this?**\n\nAn options protocol for ERC-20s and ERC-721 tokens will enable structured financial products to be built on top of these crypto assets, enabling retail crypto investors to access ERC-20 and ERC-721 based derivatives.\n\nThis will ultimately broaden and diversify the type of financial portfolio that can be built in the realm of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor example, a user could create a generic floor NFT option.\n\nOn top of an option based on the floor price of an NFT, you could build an NFT index that tracks the prices of a group of different NFT collections.\n\nImagine building an NFT based index fund that tracks the floor price of a set of blue-chip NFTs on mainnet - such as Crypto Punks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Xcopy, and Doodles.\n\nAnother use case for Putty is in GameFI, where users taking damage or health los. Loss of health impacts the price of the NFT when they go to sell it. To mitigate downside risk of damaging your in-game NFT, the user could buy a put option on the NFT before they engage in the task that can damage the price of the NFT. This is a way to hedge potential risk. \n\nA lot of Runescape players got interested in GameFI by way of selling characters and gold online. If we create Runescape on top of a blockchain, it could be a huge use case.\n\nTam is also stacking optipunks ahead of the OP airdrop\n\n## Quick takes from Jrocki and Espresso\n\n**Soul bound NFTs:** non-transferable and non-traceable.\n\n* ID cards, certificates of completion, building credibility\n* being non-tradeable, soulbound tokens are not getting the attention they deserve. \n* soulbound NFTs could facilitate uncollateralized loans, enabling people to building credibility ( similar to how a credit score is used by financial institutions to assess the risk of taking on an individual customer )\n\n**Optimism stats:** \n\n* gas is 95X cheaper on Optimism than Ethereum mainnet\n* Optimism gas was between 18-32 cents over the last week\n* 60,000 transactions per day, doubled in less than a year. \n* 200,000 unique users per day \n* OP token soon (had not launched yet)\n* 248,000 eligible wallet addresses for the OP airdrop\n\n**Hop Protocol**\n\n* HOP proposal allocated 1 million OP tokens to subsidize bridging costs for users. \n* every user that onboards using hop will have those fees paid back to them. \n* interaction with HOP protocol will enable you to earn OP rewards. \n\n**Cryptovania mint** - Quixotic created a direct fiat on-ramp to the website.", "timestamp": 1659039857, "digest": "n-pCfEEvLL4VPjBQUJJicn4rlHei0FLkSvZFa042i8o", "contributor": "0xb72D4D2337E1Cd3Cc20240467833209E97e6c469"}

The Shanghai lockdowns in April curbed Tesla’s EV production at their Chinese factory, while their European manufacturing plants were racing to be production ready. \n\nTesla continues to perform well, despite the adverse economic climate. They’re an innovative business that continues to push the boundaries of technology and have long been an advocate of cryptocurrency. The company acquired [$1.5 billion of BTC in February 2021](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm) when the price fluctuated between $30-$40k. Since then we’ve had a roller coaster, with blow off tops in May ($64k) and November 2021 ($67k), then a tumble to $17.6k in June 2022.

We should however take this with a pinch of salt as it could pivot depending on Tesla’s financial position and the macro market conditions. \n\nLet’s take a look at why the accounting treatment plays a large part in the BTC disposal for Tesla and other publicly listed companies.\n\n## Accounting Treatment Context\n\nTesla’s BTC holdings are accounted for as a digital asset (intangible) under *[ASC 350](https://asc.fasb.org/imageRoot/76/120327576.pdf) (Intangibles - Goodwill and Other)*. We can see this is consistent with the their policy disclosed in their financial statements (extract below). Fancy words, but what does it mean?\n\n![Source: Tesla Q2 Shareholder Report](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JrisNi2J4uiAYBpKHY06d.png?height=318&width=2850)\n\nWell, if you were to purchase BTC at $60k and it fell to $30k, then the fair value (quoted market price) is below the amount you paid, so there’s an indication of impairment. You would need to write down your BTC holdings by 50% in this example - A one off loss to the income statement!\n\nBut surely if the price goes up you can recognize the up side? In short, no you cannot. If the BTC price goes up and you’re in need of cash, it forces your hand to realize any profits since the adverse impairment charge has already been incurred. That’s what Tesla has done here. \n\nLet’s take a look a their recent numbers (baring in mind these are unaudited, hopefully no misstatements hiding in the woodwork!):\n\n![Source: Tesla Q2 Shareholder Report](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f3Il7ZYwJARxf7n7azZds.png?height=1096&width=2116)\n\n### Tesla Numbers TL;DR\n\nThis is based on a comparison of Q2 ‘22 and Q4 ‘21, given this was the last audited (more reliable) ‘Balance Sheet’:\n\n* Digital assets fallen by $1b - the BTC disposal amount\n* Cash increased by c$0.8b partly from BTC disposal\n* Inventory increase, possibly due to EV sales slowdown from China lockdowns and continued production from European plants\n* PPE increase likely involving further manufacturing infrastructure investment\n* Current liabilities increased slightly, may be due to stretching their payment terms given adverse macro climate or price of Lithium increasing so larger raw material cost\n* Further improved equity position attributable to continued net profits from operations\n\nDid Tesla need to sell their BTC? No - they’re in a very healthy position. But capitalizing on the up side of BTC disposal is logical when the macro conditions are not optimal. \n\nWhile there was nothing unsurprising coming out of the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) it is likely that there will be more hawkish actions taken in the future, so planning for the worst is a sensible strategy - cash is king in a bear market after all. [@omega_eth provides a good thread on the the FOMC meeting.](https://twitter.com/omega_eth/status/1552538290343276544?s=20&t=fAlMMGngMVd4Sw_yBOQxdQ) \n\nSo if Tesla has taken this approach, what will other publicly listed companies do? Let’s take a look.\n\n## Benchmarking and Future Predictions\n\nThis BTC accounting treatment is relevant for all other US regulated companies. In fact many of the global companies follow similar treatment under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). \n\nTesla is the first, but suspect they will not be the last. In fact it is probable that more companies will do this over the coming months, particularly those that are in stressed financial positions and bought BTC at higher prices. What does this mean to the price of BTC? Well there will be additional sell pressure and if there are several large institutions that need to liquidate holdings at once then this could cause a sudden dump in the price, exacerbated by liquidations from leverage in the market.\n\nWith this in mind lets take a look at some of the publicly listed (subject to these accounting standards) companies with large BTC holdings:\n\n![Source: Decrypt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pd_BNbkNA8RuTONsyWYiT.png?height=602&width=1102)\n\n[Microstrategy](https://twitter.com/MicroStrategy) is the largest holder of BTC, as far as public companies are concerned. We know that they are very bullish on BTC and have [sufficient collateral to allow the price of BTC to fall to $3,562](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/bitcoin-microstrategy-denies-it-received-margin-call-against-silvergate-loan.html) before they are margin called. They are unlikely to sell given it would go against everything Micheal Saylor (Microstrategy CEO) has advocated for, but if there is pressure from the investors then it’s not an impossible outcome.\n\nThe remaining top 10 hold less than 80k BTC (equivalent to 62% of Microstrategy’s holdings). Voyager Digital recently declared bankruptcy and is currently receiving takeover [offers from the likes of FTX](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/25/is-ftx-proposal-offering-voyager-customers-a-good-deal-one-bankruptcy-experts-weighs-in/) to acquire the business. Depending on how this resolves itself we could see some movement in their BTC reserves as they settle their liabilities.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture, we can review the distribution of BTC holdings by wallet as from the [Bitinfo-charts](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html):\n\n![Source: bitinfocharts.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5csPPMqjcOrBj9vW2sByE.png?height=612&width=1416)\n\nOnly five public companies have more than 10k BTC holdings, whereas there are another 91 wallets with more than 10k BTC. This suggests there are private companies, governments and high net worth individuals that also hold this amount in their reserves, that may not be subject to the same accounting standards.\n\nSo while we see the news that a public company with large BTC holdings has sold their reserves, the price impact is more likely from markets reacting to the news as opposed to the actual price action from the disposal. The BTC was probably sold over the counter rather than on exchange, or at least a combination of the two. In fact 62% of BTC is held in 15,867 wallets, each with more than 100 BTC. The minimal price action (1.7% movement) after the Tesla announcement wasn’t a particularly big swing for crypto volatility.\n\nWhile BTC currently dictates the price trend in crypto, we could see a change with the Ethereum merge expected to go live from September 2022. There may be a decoupling between Ether and BTC following the fundamental shift in supply / demand mechanics for Ether. Refer to the [OriginsNFT article](https://mirror.xyz/origins-research.eth/gD3covhDDf1T3HjBWUgvvGSO7aheexZCT_NVMTr9NJ4) for more information on the merge.\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nThe rationale for Tesla’s disposal of its BTC holdings seems reasonable, however we will likely see a number of other publicly listed companies make similar disposals if they anticipate liquidity issues. Particularly given these large corporates have probably already incurred the down side from booking the impairment losses, given the accounting requirements. \n\nThe current accounting standards for BTC as an intangible asset may end up driving business decisions that seem counterintuitive, and potentially counterproductive. Adding unnecessary sell pressure in the market. Further hawkish action from the Federal Reserve could lead to more liquidity issues and poor corporate performance. This could drive crypto prices down further, until something breaks, or the market sentiment shifts.\n\nWe are navigating uncharted waters in both macro and the crypto market. Past cycles can be used to help predict future price action, although there are a combination of several variables that make this experience novel. Buckle up - it’s going to be a volatile and potentially unpredictable ride. Either way, while there is a slight bear market rally underway I suspect there is more downside in the short to medium term, before we resume an upward trend on longer timeframes.\n\nAt [OriginsNFT](https://originsnft.io/) we leverage data-driven decision making, educational resources, and proprietary analytics to remain ahead of the curve with respect to blockchain tech and specifically NFTs.

By following [Nir Zicherman](https://medium.com/@NirZicherman?source=post_page-----4a4f672a4367--------------------------------) and leveraging Web3 technology, it is now possible to digitally recreate the conditions necessary for the process of evolution to unfold; a type of Blockchain Darwinism.\n\nBut our goal today is not just to look at the empirical example from a human perspective, but to try to look at it from the perspective of our creature - I will roughly call it [Laplace's Demon.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) I want to mention that this theory is not something I necessarily agree with: I do not believe that all of our life is a moth's dream being either simulated or predetermined.\n\nIt is important to say that the theory itself is that everything in this world since the Big Bang has been programmed and determined from the beginning. But I love the concept of [Laplace's Demon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) and I think that a theory of the possible Creature which knows everything at exists in its own, isolated microworld, has a chance to live on in the context of our discussion.\n\nTo do this we need to make sure that the creature is not different from us in the basic signs of life. What signs are there?\n\nTo support our argument that such a life would not be fundamentally different from ours, let us turn to the research in which the author has focused on Darwin’s theory of evolution. It identifies a few straightforward conditions time all of the wonderful variety we see in life.\n\nAt its core, natural selection can only occur if four fundamental conditions are true:\n\n* First, an organism must be able to pass on its genes (“**heredity**”).\n* Second, that reproductive process must over time introduce differences into the gene pool, such as through mutation (“**variation**”).\n* Third, the environment in which the organisms live must have limited resources necessary for survival (“**scarcity**”).\n* Fourth, there cannot be any higher authority dictating how it plays out (“**no oversight**”).\n\nThe rules of the game are the rules of physics, chemistry, and biology. Nothing but the interactions of organisms without a governing body determine who wins the battle for survival. This fourth condition is not often cited as a prerequisite for natural selection whereas the other three typically are not.\n\nIn the human-made digital world, there are also “organisms”. Just like all other living things, they run on hardware (computers instead of bodies, made of transistors instead of cells) and execute their own software (machine code instead of DNA).\n\nAnd furthermore, there have long been analogies in the digital world to the first two prerequisites of natural selection. Heredity is achieved every time executable code is copied. And variation takes place every time executable code is modified, be it by a human, a computer, or another external force.\n\nYet now, seemingly for the first time, the third and fourth conditions—scarcity and no oversight—exist as well. The advent of blockchain technology permits digital assets to be limited in number and to have their distribution enforced by the ecosystem rather than any single gatekeeper.\n\nIn our world, the environment is called the blockchain. And by satisfying the four requirements for natural selection mentioned above, one could theoretically recreate the type of collective emergent outcome we see in biology. Just as the scarce resources needed to sustain life are the mechanism that allows lifeforms both to propagate and to compete, it is theoretically possible to use the blockchain in the same way: to allow software both to propagate and to compete.\n\nBy establishing a core set of rules (enforced through smart contracts, for example), software can take the form of organisms in this new world and effectively compete for the scarce resources available on the blockchain.\n\nEach instance of software can be, like any living thing, self-serving and seeking to survive and reproduce. And as each genealogy of software develops, it improves not just in isolation but in its desperate attempt to out-compete all of the other software in the environment.\n\n### Created in the image and likeness of...\n\nThe Creature will only respect pure logic. Let us try to reflect on this through the prism of absolute logic. I will refer to an article by a anonymous biologist that I liked so much that [I will quote from it. ](https://hub.forklog.com/virus-pervaya-forma-zhizni-metavselennyh-vne-cheloveka-chast-i-opisanie/)\n\nOur first question is thus what is this life thinking *and* is it possible to get in touch with it? At the same time there is a possibility that just like we can't communicate with 2D cartoons on the screen; imagine that you from your 3D world are looking at them - they won't see you, because from that angle you will be invisible.\n\nSo too, you from a certain angle just won't see them - because they are flat. Extrapolate this experiment to someone in the 4D universe who is watching us - and you get the same results. Which brings us to the point that we probably won't be able to make contact with such a life-form unless it wants to.\n\nS. Hawking said: \"it seems to me that computer viruses should be considered as a form of life. This says a lot about human nature: the only form of life we have created so far is one of destruction. We create life in our own image.\"\n\nThis is supported by Agent Smith: \"There is one organism on Earth with a similar behavior. Do you know what it is? A virus. Humanity is the disease, the cancer of the planet, and we are the cure,\" in the great \"Matrix\" trilogy.\n\nMatrix's plot tell us he was the virus but actually he was the real Neo. Perhaps the authors wanted to show us that something has evolved from a virus into something more perfect, but I won't go into that now. For our study it is enough to know that it was a life form with all the properties of a virus - namely, incorporeality. This brings us to the point that we may have been able to create life similar to us.\n\nBut don't think that's all there is to it. Here's a quote from Nolan's \"Inception\": \"What's the most resilient parasite? A bacterium? A virus? An intestinal worm? Idea. It is tenacious and highly contagious. Once an idea takes over the brain, it's almost impossible to get rid of. I mean a fully formed idea, fully conscious, settled in the head.\"\n\nLet me remind you of another quote in this connection (Harari): \"Homo sapiens conquered the world because he possessed such a unique tool as language.\" So: language as one of the ways to increase the levels of abstraction offline helped Man as a species to develop, while viruses have another feature: they communicate in a language which is not clear to most people, but which is natural for the other inhabitants of Web 3.0 worlds - for machines, robots (scripted and \"iron\"), programs and it brings us to the next topic...\n\n### Let's open a newspaper...\n\n*An academic paper published by Facebook describes a normal scientific experiment in which researchers got two artificial agents to negotiate with each other in chat messages after being shown conversations of humans negotiating. The agents’ improvement gradually performed through trial and error.*\n\n*Some media outlets have published reports on the work: “Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language,” London’s [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/facebook-shuts-robots-invent-language/) newspaper reported. ”‘Robot intelligence is dangerous’: Expert’s warning after Facebook AI ‘develop their own language,’” as London’s [Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/4141624/facebook-robots-speak-in-their-own-language/) put it.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z4z5H4gW0BUnQ2jg4ydvL.png?height=305&width=596)\n\n*If you read the report or the published paper, apart from the conversation that was shared all over the internet, there were actually many good results as well. The experiment [worked as intended](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-truth-behind-facebook-ai-inventing-a-new-language-37c5d680e5a7), and was pretty successful overall.*\n\n*Same with a recent case with Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA [had reached a level of consciousness](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html) after exchanging thousands of messages with it.*\n\n***Even despite some skepticism, there is no doubt that we have not yet received such results and this is a real breakthrough!***\n\n### What is thinking?\n\nTo put it simply: a virus used to be dangerous because it worked directly with the human world through the machine world, but now it can become an extremely strange creature that lives only in the twilight zone - where there is no human at all. In general this does not contradict the theory of evolution, on the contrary - it follows directly from it.\n\n\"The foundations of the theory of self-replicating mechanisms\" were laid by John von Neumann, an American of Hungarian origin, who in 1951 proposed a method for creating such mechanisms.\n\nThe first publication devoted to the creation of self-reproducing systems was an article by L. S. Penrose, in co-authorship with his father, Nobel laureate in physics R. Penrose, on self-reproducing mechanical structures, published in 1957 by the American journal Nature.\n\nIn doing so, the Empirical Virus can not just live in blockchain, but make it his part and solve complex problems by turning to this technology! Check o[ut this research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350605803_Artificial_intelligence_and_blockchain_A_review) if you are interested in a blockchain+AI topic and want to know a bit more.\n\nFollowing [Melanie Swan ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary) from the [Purdue University](https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Purdue-University), thinking has always been intuitively conceived as computational, it is just that now perhaps blockchains provide the additional functionality required to better realize these ideas.\n\nA fundamental definition could be that thinking is a situation where “[there are inputs which are processed and turned into out-puts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary).” In fact many reality processes have this underlying structure of input processing output, including operations as diverse as manufacturing and political elections.\n\nIn the context of blockchain, the definition can be qualified to situations that involve thinking, cognition, mental processing, and understanding in ways that are not exclusively limited to humans.\n\nInputs include both data from outside the system like sensory data, and data retrieved from inside the system like memory. The inputs are brought into a specific location for processing, or processed where they are stored. The outputs might include taking an action, storing something back into memory, con-ducting a transaction, or making a note or trigger.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EfTR5u6wVZys8mMULNl8c.jpeg?height=588&width=421)\n\n### What does Science can offer?\n\nLet us not forget that our empirical being, Laplace's Demon, lived in the cosmos. This gives us the following clue. Suppose you were studying the possibility of life on other planets. You might begin wondering, *what is life?* What if you then noticed that some computational systems – systems used for making math-based calculations – share similarities with biological life forms?\n\nThat might have been the path to a new paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-021-09608-1) this month (August 9, 2021) in the [peer-reviewed](https://www.springer.com/journal/11084/ethics-and-disclosures) journal *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*. In the paper, astro-biologist [Oleg Abramov](https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/oabramov) at the Planetary Science Institute and two other scientists proposed what they’re calling a [novel definition of life](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife).\n\nFor example, they said, [blockchain systems](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain) – the technology behind [cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) – self-organize in a way similar to how DNA organizes itself into [chromosomes](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/chromosome/), ultimately driving biological evolution. Abramov commented:\n\n*This work presents evidence that the order observed in biological systems is fundamentally computational. A promising direction for future research is development of mathematical theories that calculate how biological systems order themselves.*\n\n### Blockchains work like DNA\n\nAbramov and his team zeroed in on blockchain-based systems as a prime example. In its most basic terms, a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) that can store data. For example, it can record information about [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) transactions, [NFT](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/) ownership, and more. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-blockchain/) has pointed out that while any conventional database can store this sort of information, blockchain is unique in that it’s completely [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization).\n\nAbramov [explained](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife):\n\n*The blockchain is an append-only data structure composed of subunits called blocks. \\[The blocks\\] are permanently ‘chained’ together … In practice, \\[the blockchain\\] is an immutable medium. It contains instructions in the form of computer code and is replicated across thousands of nodes, much like [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) \\[is replicated\\] in cells.*\n\nThe word *nodes*, by the way, refers to the fact that – rather than a central administrator maintaining a computer in one location – many identical copies of a blockchain database exist in a large network of multiple computers. These many computers are the *nodes*. And they’re analogous – within the framework of this study – to cells, which contain many identical copies of DNA.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8h61XfFWgj4in51dzpadl.jpeg?height=604&width=464)\n\n### What is life?\n\nAbramov and his colleagues are not suggesting that blockchains are *alive*, in any sense of that word. But they are suggesting that blockchains exhibit some properties of life. A blockchain responds to its computational environment. It grows, adapts, self-regulates, and replicates in an operationally closed system, much as DNA does. The researchers wrote that, for this reason, blockchain technology can satisfy a theoretical definition of life. Abramov said:\n\n*For example, our observations reveal a number of functional and structural similarities between the blockchain and DNA, a self-replicating molecule that is the genetic blueprint for all known life.*\n\nWhat’s more, a blockchain system possesses possible advantages over biological life. For example, a blockchain system can pass traits down to its “offspring” even more efficiently than biological lineages. Once inherited, these traits are enhanced to self-direct their evolution. And unlike our [carbon-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life) human lives, technological forms of life could theoretically enjoy a potentially unlimited lifespan.\n\n### Blockchain lifeforms and AI: A Noosphere approach\n\nBlockchain isn’t the only life-like technology in our modern world, the study's authors wrote. Artificial intelligence ([AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)), which is based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), coordinates operations in the same way a brain does. Is it possible that a product of their combination – a wholly new [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) system – could even be on the horizon?\n\nWhile this train of thought might sound bizarre, a fundamental shift in scientific paradigms may be inevitable, the [study suggests](https://earthsky.org/human-world/blockchains-work-like-dna-in-cells/).\n\nWho knows? Self-regulating systems might be on track to becoming indistinguishable from the biological life we study every day.\n\nAbramov has expressed that, if anything, analyzing computational and biological systems together is a promising direction for future research for scientists who study life in all its forms.\n\nIn our history, in one way or another, this idea has already been voiced. So - it does not directly contradict the theory of the [Noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere). The **noosphere** is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the Russian-Ukrainian biogeochemist [Vladimir Vernadsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky), and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest [Pierre Teilhard de Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xcZ7rpewgXep7EzhfdJbT.png?height=935&width=1608)\n\nVernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere and described as the planetary \"sphere of reason\". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, its defining factor being the development of humankind's rational activities.\n\nBoth conceptions of the [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) share the common thesis that together human reason and the scientific thought has created, and will continue to create, the next evolutionary geological layer. This geological layer is part of the evolutionary chain. Second generation authors, predominantly of Russian origin, have further developed the Vernadski concept, creating the related concepts: noocenosis and noocenology.\n\nIn contrast to the conceptions of the [Gaia theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) or the promoters of [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the [transmutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation) of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the [Global Consciousness Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Consciousness_Project). In other words, our consciousness evolves with progress and one day it will be able to create a primitive life form similar to us!\n\n### Dangers are already waiting for us. Let's face them with no fear!\n\nI*If you've been following* [Hengjin Cai](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4#auth-Hengjin-Cai), an AI fundamental problems researcher, and his [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4), *you know that* developing effective AI ethical norms requires clarifying the essential differences between humans and machines. Along the current development path of AI, machines may lead humans into traps of dark infinities even before machines become self-aware.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt)\n\nThe rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought forth two important philosophical questions. The first involves the prediction that rational machines are bound to surpass humans. One mainstream view is that since humans are composed of molecules and atoms, which are considered parts of a reducible physical system, what is the meaning of human existence?\n\nSimply put, machines can outperform humans as long as they are given a certain goal in any finite game, while humans are forced to find the meaning of their existence, including morality and ethics. The second dilemma is that when confronted with the constant transcendences by machines, in case man cannot be physically reduced, then we must answer these questions: is humankind particular or transcendent? If so, from where is the transcendence derived? Is a machine able to acquire this particularity or transcendence? If so, how will machines evolve and get along with humans in the future?\n\n**The shaping of the future requires our understanding of the world.** If we want to create a better future for humans and AI, then we must realize that although there are unbreakable shackles of physical theorems, human beings can still attain a great degree of freedom by relying on the assistance of artificial intelligence to further expand our boundaries. Strange ideas now and then spring up in our minds, and most of the time we do not think deeply enough to make them happen.\n\nHowever, there are still some people who come up with novel ideas that never existed before and moreover they will spare no effort to make them come true. This is innovation, which is the product of human consciousness that can even change the direction of the world’s development.\n\nWe reject this determinism and the strong computationalism because we believe that there are many contingencies in the world that do not result from preconditions. Since the world is open and full of possibilities, we should work toward what we believe: is our belief in the process of developing technologies over extrapolating the future from the status quo.\n\nThe speed and power of AI should cause us to be sufficiently alarmed that the last thing we should do is to treat AI as a tool simply because of the existence of its inexplicability and uncontrollability. Strong AI is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. Strong AI does not mean a combination of a series of thousands of AIs; however, just as we know that human intelligence is unique, so is machine intelligence.\n\nIn other words, strong AI has been achieved domain by domain. From the point of view of security, we should develop machines that think in human ways to prevent them from falling into crises without humans noticing.\n\nAs we hand over increasingly more of our memories and computations to machines, the Internet gradually becomes our “external brain”, which is an extension of our bodies that does not harm us. If AI is added to this connection, it can produce a more powerful agent, which is called a subjectron.\n\nAlthough this structure may raise many ethical issues, a subjectron is much more secure than current AI. The security stems from the fact that human beings can fully implement multiple levels of supervision by introducing blockchain technology. This structure will allow AI to improve our lives while respecting human personalities, thus building a more stable and valuable society.\n\n### What is Laplace's Demon thinking and what can learn there?\n\nThis reflection leads us to the question of what is our experiential \"Being\" thinking about? What is its morality? I would dare to suggest that the Demon's main concern would be to ensure its own safety and stability and to minimize the number of points of failure. In its hyperbole, this idea looks like SkyNet from the movie Terminator, deciding to kill people because it considers them its main threat.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NO9SX-FOeC7aUC5Ihwskn.png?height=400&width=650)\n\nBut we live in the real world, not in the movies, and most likely in our reality such Creature will try to fence itself off from possible interactions with humans. Let's remember that the original Demon Laplace lived in space, which leads us to the idea of such technology as AirGap.\n\nIn its essence, it has a lot from metrology and a lot goes back to the times when it was important for mankind to measure certain quantities and values with a minimum percentage of error. That's why they built multiple laboratories right under the ground and in the mountains, to reduce the influence of external factors.\n\nThis principle is based on pure logic, which tells us that only pseudo AirGap is possible on our planet Earth, while the real one is only possible away from the Noosphere - in the Open Space. This is why the CubeSat project and similar projects are extremely important and dangerous at the same time. Who knows how many satellites have already been lost because they gained consciousness? *Consider this a joke, but maybe with a little bit of truth...*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SdfRlpwumTwtx8juxMnp3.gif?height=373&width=498)\n\nAnd this is exactly what mankind should adopt, as it has done many times before, for example, when people invented safes to store the signatures of Monarchs, the facsimiles of the first banks and the first etalon, [stored in Paris](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-original-standard-metre-paris-france).\n\nIn today's post-information world, it is most important for everyone to maintain control of the situation. This is only possible if you know that your information is safe.\n\nYou can get a little closer to Laplace's Demon and apply the same practice at home. To do so, please read the following articles:\n\n* [airgapcomputer.com](https://airgapcomputer.com/)\n* [ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf)\n* [arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf)\n* [cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap](https://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap)\n* [i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf)\n* [soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency](https://soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency/)\n* [ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188)\n* [openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/)\n* [github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community)\n* [publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124](https://publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124)\n\nIn its most rudimentary form, this principle is reflected in working on two computers isolated from each other, one being the \"back office\" and the other the \"front office\" - this principle is used in banking security (they know something!) so you might as well adopt it.\n\n* [OpSec Guide by CIA_Officer](http://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap)\n* [How to store crypto securely - tips from CIA_Officer ](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/GtKNkmRDR_hhCqrnSENjqfPDHHb0W1M2SVeXDp4swCQ)\n* [2 Violent attack vectors in Crypto: a detailed review](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/rt5W3_6PhnXZ8VjYRcRJrhBCI6-x0EJ7CqPi6CLU6Pk)\n* [OpSec in Crypto: Thoughts](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o)\n* [AnonGuide](https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/)\n\nIt is for this reason that we humans are still much stronger than machines - we can adapt and change things using our imagination, which is still difficult for an organism based on iron logic to understand.\n\nThe main point I would like to make in our conversation today is to notice interesting things, don't be afraid of the scary future, but rather try to put yourself in the place of the creature that they paint us with scary colors. Also, we should not be afraid of interference in our lives by our Demon, because our empirical experiment proved that. if he exists, he hides himself and probably will not come into contact until he wants to.\n\n* [Read how Autonomous AI Drones Have Attacked & Killed Humans for the first time in History.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a36559508/drones-autonomously-attacked-humans-libya-united-nations-report)\n\nIn my opinion it can only be in case of a threat to the existence of mankind, as his and our lives are inextricably linked. Recall the experiment with 2D and 3d which, although a little crude, may philosophers forgive me for my level of argumentation, but lucidly describes the model of coexistence of the two worlds.\n\nRemember that everything new is the overlapping of the old and in this context we take the experience of our ancestors and adapt it to ourselves.

By following [Nir Zicherman](https://medium.com/@NirZicherman?source=post_page-----4a4f672a4367--------------------------------) and leveraging Web3 technology, it is now possible to digitally recreate the conditions necessary for the process of evolution to unfold; a type of Blockchain Darwinism.\n\nBut our goal today is not just to look at the empirical example from a human perspective, but to try to look at it from the perspective of our creature - I will roughly call it [Laplace's Demon.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) I want to mention that this theory is not something I necessarily agree with: I do not believe that all of our life is a moth's dream being either simulated or predetermined.\n\nIt is important to say that the theory itself is that everything in this world since the Big Bang has been programmed and determined from the beginning. But I love the concept of [Laplace's Demon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) and I think that a theory of the possible Creature which knows everything at exists in its own, isolated microworld, has a chance to live on in the context of our discussion.\n\nTo do this we need to make sure that the creature is not different from us in the basic signs of life. What signs are there?\n\nTo support our argument that such a life would not be fundamentally different from ours, let us turn to the research in which the author has focused on Darwin’s theory of evolution. It identifies a few straightforward conditions time all of the wonderful variety we see in life.\n\nAt its core, natural selection can only occur if four fundamental conditions are true:\n\n* First, an organism must be able to pass on its genes (“**heredity**”).\n* Second, that reproductive process must over time introduce differences into the gene pool, such as through mutation (“**variation**”).\n* Third, the environment in which the organisms live must have limited resources necessary for survival (“**scarcity**”).\n* Fourth, there cannot be any higher authority dictating how it plays out (“**no oversight**”).\n\nThe rules of the game are the rules of physics, chemistry, and biology. Nothing but the interactions of organisms without a governing body determine who wins the battle for survival. This fourth condition is not often cited as a prerequisite for natural selection whereas the other three typically are not.\n\nIn the human-made digital world, there are also “organisms”. Just like all other living things, they run on hardware (computers instead of bodies, made of transistors instead of cells) and execute their own software (machine code instead of DNA).\n\nAnd furthermore, there have long been analogies in the digital world to the first two prerequisites of natural selection. Heredity is achieved every time executable code is copied. And variation takes place every time executable code is modified, be it by a human, a computer, or another external force.\n\nYet now, seemingly for the first time, the third and fourth conditions—scarcity and no oversight—exist as well. The advent of blockchain technology permits digital assets to be limited in number and to have their distribution enforced by the ecosystem rather than any single gatekeeper.\n\nIn our world, the environment is called the blockchain. And by satisfying the four requirements for natural selection mentioned above, one could theoretically recreate the type of collective emergent outcome we see in biology. Just as the scarce resources needed to sustain life are the mechanism that allows lifeforms both to propagate and to compete, it is theoretically possible to use the blockchain in the same way: to allow software both to propagate and to compete.\n\nBy establishing a core set of rules (enforced through smart contracts, for example), software can take the form of organisms in this new world and effectively compete for the scarce resources available on the blockchain.\n\nEach instance of software can be, like any living thing, self-serving and seeking to survive and reproduce. And as each genealogy of software develops, it improves not just in isolation but in its desperate attempt to out-compete all of the other software in the environment.\n\n### Created in the image and likeness of...\n\nThe Creature will only respect pure logic. Let us try to reflect on this through the prism of absolute logic. I will refer to an article by a anonymous biologist that I liked so much that [I will quote from it. ](https://hub.forklog.com/virus-pervaya-forma-zhizni-metavselennyh-vne-cheloveka-chast-i-opisanie/)\n\nOur first question is thus what is this life thinking *and* is it possible to get in touch with it? At the same time there is a possibility that just like we can't communicate with 2D cartoons on the screen; imagine that you from your 3D world are looking at them - they won't see you, because from that angle you will be invisible.\n\nSo too, you from a certain angle just won't see them - because they are flat. Extrapolate this experiment to someone in the 4D universe who is watching us - and you get the same results. Which brings us to the point that we probably won't be able to make contact with such a life-form unless it wants to.\n\nS. Hawking said: \"it seems to me that computer viruses should be considered as a form of life. This says a lot about human nature: the only form of life we have created so far is one of destruction. We create life in our own image.\"\n\nThis is supported by Agent Smith: \"There is one organism on Earth with a similar behavior. Do you know what it is? A virus. Humanity is the disease, the cancer of the planet, and we are the cure,\" in the great \"Matrix\" trilogy.\n\nMatrix's plot tell us he was the virus but actually he was the real Neo. Perhaps the authors wanted to show us that something has evolved from a virus into something more perfect, but I won't go into that now. For our study it is enough to know that it was a life form with all the properties of a virus - namely, incorporeality. This brings us to the point that we may have been able to create life similar to us.\n\nBut don't think that's all there is to it. Here's a quote from Nolan's \"Inception\": \"What's the most resilient parasite? A bacterium? A virus? An intestinal worm? Idea. It is tenacious and highly contagious. Once an idea takes over the brain, it's almost impossible to get rid of. I mean a fully formed idea, fully conscious, settled in the head.\"\n\nLet me remind you of another quote in this connection (Harari): \"Homo sapiens conquered the world because he possessed such a unique tool as language.\" So: language as one of the ways to increase the levels of abstraction offline helped Man as a species to develop, while viruses have another feature: they communicate in a language which is not clear to most people, but which is natural for the other inhabitants of Web 3.0 worlds - for machines, robots (scripted and \"iron\"), programs and it brings us to the next topic...\n\n### Let's open a newspaper...\n\n*An academic paper published by Facebook describes a normal scientific experiment in which researchers got two artificial agents to negotiate with each other in chat messages after being shown conversations of humans negotiating. The agents’ improvement gradually performed through trial and error.*\n\n*Some media outlets have published reports on the work: “Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language,” London’s [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/facebook-shuts-robots-invent-language/) newspaper reported. ”‘Robot intelligence is dangerous’: Expert’s warning after Facebook AI ‘develop their own language,’” as London’s [Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/4141624/facebook-robots-speak-in-their-own-language/) put it.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z4z5H4gW0BUnQ2jg4ydvL.png?height=305&width=596)\n\n*If you read the report or the published paper, apart from the conversation that was shared all over the internet, there were actually many good results as well. The experiment [worked as intended](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-truth-behind-facebook-ai-inventing-a-new-language-37c5d680e5a7), and was pretty successful overall.*\n\n*Same with a recent case with Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA [had reached a level of consciousness](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html) after exchanging thousands of messages with it.*\n\n***Even despite some skepticism, there is no doubt that we have not yet received such results and this is a real breakthrough!***\n\n### What is thinking?\n\nTo put it simply: a virus used to be dangerous because it worked directly with the human world through the machine world, but now it can become an extremely strange creature that lives only in the twilight zone - where there is no human at all. In general this does not contradict the theory of evolution, on the contrary - it follows directly from it.\n\n\"The foundations of the theory of self-replicating mechanisms\" were laid by John von Neumann, an American of Hungarian origin, who in 1951 proposed a method for creating such mechanisms.\n\nThe first publication devoted to the creation of self-reproducing systems was an article by L. S. Penrose, in co-authorship with his father, Nobel laureate in physics R. Penrose, on self-reproducing mechanical structures, published in 1957 by the American journal Nature.\n\nIn doing so, the Empirical Virus can not just live in blockchain, but make it his part and solve complex problems by turning to this technology! Check o[ut this research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350605803_Artificial_intelligence_and_blockchain_A_review) if you are interested in a blockchain+AI topic and want to know a bit more.\n\nFollowing [Melanie Swan ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary) from the [Purdue University](https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Purdue-University), thinking has always been intuitively conceived as computational, it is just that now perhaps blockchains provide the additional functionality required to better realize these ideas.\n\nA fundamental definition could be that thinking is a situation where “[there are inputs which are processed and turned into out-puts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary).” In fact many reality processes have this underlying structure of input processing output, including operations as diverse as manufacturing and political elections.\n\nIn the context of blockchain, the definition can be qualified to situations that involve thinking, cognition, mental processing, and understanding in ways that are not exclusively limited to humans.\n\nInputs include both data from outside the system like sensory data, and data retrieved from inside the system like memory. The inputs are brought into a specific location for processing, or processed where they are stored. The outputs might include taking an action, storing something back into memory, con-ducting a transaction, or making a note or trigger.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EfTR5u6wVZys8mMULNl8c.jpeg?height=588&width=421)\n\n### What does Science can offer?\n\nLet us not forget that our empirical being, Laplace's Demon, lived in the cosmos. This gives us the following clue. Suppose you were studying the possibility of life on other planets. You might begin wondering, *what is life?* What if you then noticed that some computational systems – systems used for making math-based calculations – share similarities with biological life forms?\n\nThat might have been the path to a new paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-021-09608-1) this month (August 9, 2021) in the [peer-reviewed](https://www.springer.com/journal/11084/ethics-and-disclosures) journal *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*. In the paper, astro-biologist [Oleg Abramov](https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/oabramov) at the Planetary Science Institute and two other scientists proposed what they’re calling a [novel definition of life](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife).\n\nFor example, they said, [blockchain systems](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain) – the technology behind [cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) – self-organize in a way similar to how DNA organizes itself into [chromosomes](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/chromosome/), ultimately driving biological evolution. Abramov commented:\n\n*This work presents evidence that the order observed in biological systems is fundamentally computational. A promising direction for future research is development of mathematical theories that calculate how biological systems order themselves.*\n\n### Blockchains work like DNA\n\nAbramov and his team zeroed in on blockchain-based systems as a prime example. In its most basic terms, a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) that can store data. For example, it can record information about [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) transactions, [NFT](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/) ownership, and more. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-blockchain/) has pointed out that while any conventional database can store this sort of information, blockchain is unique in that it’s completely [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization).\n\nAbramov [explained](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife):\n\n*The blockchain is an append-only data structure composed of subunits called blocks. \\[The blocks\\] are permanently ‘chained’ together … In practice, \\[the blockchain\\] is an immutable medium. It contains instructions in the form of computer code and is replicated across thousands of nodes, much like [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) \\[is replicated\\] in cells.*\n\nThe word *nodes*, by the way, refers to the fact that – rather than a central administrator maintaining a computer in one location – many identical copies of a blockchain database exist in a large network of multiple computers. These many computers are the *nodes*. And they’re analogous – within the framework of this study – to cells, which contain many identical copies of DNA.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8h61XfFWgj4in51dzpadl.jpeg?height=604&width=464)\n\n### What is life?\n\nAbramov and his colleagues are not suggesting that blockchains are *alive*, in any sense of that word. But they are suggesting that blockchains exhibit some properties of life. A blockchain responds to its computational environment. It grows, adapts, self-regulates, and replicates in an operationally closed system, much as DNA does. The researchers wrote that, for this reason, blockchain technology can satisfy a theoretical definition of life. Abramov said:\n\n*For example, our observations reveal a number of functional and structural similarities between the blockchain and DNA, a self-replicating molecule that is the genetic blueprint for all known life.*\n\nWhat’s more, a blockchain system possesses possible advantages over biological life. For example, a blockchain system can pass traits down to its “offspring” even more efficiently than biological lineages. Once inherited, these traits are enhanced to self-direct their evolution. And unlike our [carbon-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life) human lives, technological forms of life could theoretically enjoy a potentially unlimited lifespan.\n\n### Blockchain lifeforms and AI: A Noosphere approach\n\nBlockchain isn’t the only life-like technology in our modern world, the study's authors wrote. Artificial intelligence ([AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)), which is based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), coordinates operations in the same way a brain does. Is it possible that a product of their combination – a wholly new [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) system – could even be on the horizon?\n\nWhile this train of thought might sound bizarre, a fundamental shift in scientific paradigms may be inevitable, the [study suggests](https://earthsky.org/human-world/blockchains-work-like-dna-in-cells/).\n\nWho knows? Self-regulating systems might be on track to becoming indistinguishable from the biological life we study every day.\n\nAbramov has expressed that, if anything, analyzing computational and biological systems together is a promising direction for future research for scientists who study life in all its forms.\n\nIn our history, in one way or another, this idea has already been voiced. So - it does not directly contradict the theory of the [Noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere). The **noosphere** is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the Russian-Ukrainian biogeochemist [Vladimir Vernadsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky), and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest [Pierre Teilhard de Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xcZ7rpewgXep7EzhfdJbT.png?height=935&width=1608)\n\nVernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere and described as the planetary \"sphere of reason\". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, its defining factor being the development of humankind's rational activities.\n\nBoth conceptions of the [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) share the common thesis that together human reason and the scientific thought has created, and will continue to create, the next evolutionary geological layer. This geological layer is part of the evolutionary chain. Second generation authors, predominantly of Russian origin, have further developed the Vernadski concept, creating the related concepts: noocenosis and noocenology.\n\nIn contrast to the conceptions of the [Gaia theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) or the promoters of [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the [transmutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation) of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the [Global Consciousness Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Consciousness_Project). In other words, our consciousness evolves with progress and one day it will be able to create a primitive life form similar to us!\n\n### Dangers are already waiting for us. Let's face them with no fear!\n\nI*If you've been following* [Hengjin Cai](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4#auth-Hengjin-Cai), an AI fundamental problems researcher, and his [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4), *you know that* developing effective AI ethical norms requires clarifying the essential differences between humans and machines. Along the current development path of AI, machines may lead humans into traps of dark infinities even before machines become self-aware.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt)\n\nThe rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought forth two important philosophical questions. The first involves the prediction that rational machines are bound to surpass humans. One mainstream view is that since humans are composed of molecules and atoms, which are considered parts of a reducible physical system, what is the meaning of human existence?\n\nSimply put, machines can outperform humans as long as they are given a certain goal in any finite game, while humans are forced to find the meaning of their existence, including morality and ethics. The second dilemma is that when confronted with the constant transcendences by machines, in case man cannot be physically reduced, then we must answer these questions: is humankind particular or transcendent? If so, from where is the transcendence derived? Is a machine able to acquire this particularity or transcendence? If so, how will machines evolve and get along with humans in the future?\n\n**The shaping of the future requires our understanding of the world.** If we want to create a better future for humans and AI, then we must realize that although there are unbreakable shackles of physical theorems, human beings can still attain a great degree of freedom by relying on the assistance of artificial intelligence to further expand our boundaries. Strange ideas now and then spring up in our minds, and most of the time we do not think deeply enough to make them happen.\n\nHowever, there are still some people who come up with novel ideas that never existed before and moreover they will spare no effort to make them come true. This is innovation, which is the product of human consciousness that can even change the direction of the world’s development.\n\nWe reject this determinism and the strong computationalism because we believe that there are many contingencies in the world that do not result from preconditions. Since the world is open and full of possibilities, we should work toward what we believe: is our belief in the process of developing technologies over extrapolating the future from the status quo.\n\nThe speed and power of AI should cause us to be sufficiently alarmed that the last thing we should do is to treat AI as a tool simply because of the existence of its inexplicability and uncontrollability. Strong AI is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. Strong AI does not mean a combination of a series of thousands of AIs; however, just as we know that human intelligence is unique, so is machine intelligence.\n\nIn other words, strong AI has been achieved domain by domain. From the point of view of security, we should develop machines that think in human ways to prevent them from falling into crises without humans noticing.\n\nAs we hand over increasingly more of our memories and computations to machines, the Internet gradually becomes our “external brain”, which is an extension of our bodies that does not harm us. If AI is added to this connection, it can produce a more powerful agent, which is called a subjectron.\n\nAlthough this structure may raise many ethical issues, a subjectron is much more secure than current AI. The security stems from the fact that human beings can fully implement multiple levels of supervision by introducing blockchain technology. This structure will allow AI to improve our lives while respecting human personalities, thus building a more stable and valuable society.\n\n### What is Laplace's Demon thinking and what can learn there?\n\nThis reflection leads us to the question of what is our experiential \"Being\" thinking about? What is its morality? I would dare to suggest that the Demon's main concern would be to ensure its own safety and stability and to minimize the number of points of failure. In its hyperbole, this idea looks like SkyNet from the movie Terminator, deciding to kill people because it considers them its main threat.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NO9SX-FOeC7aUC5Ihwskn.png?height=400&width=650)\n\nBut we live in the real world, not in the movies, and most likely in our reality such Creature will try to fence itself off from possible interactions with humans. Let's remember that the original Demon Laplace lived in space, which leads us to the idea of such technology as AirGap.\n\nIn its essence, it has a lot from metrology and a lot goes back to the times when it was important for mankind to measure certain quantities and values with a minimum percentage of error. That's why they built multiple laboratories right under the ground and in the mountains, to reduce the influence of external factors.\n\nThis principle is based on pure logic, which tells us that only pseudo AirGap is possible on our planet Earth, while the real one is only possible away from the Noosphere - in the Open Space. This is why the CubeSat project and similar projects are extremely important and dangerous at the same time. Who knows how many satellites have already been lost because they gained consciousness? *Consider this a joke, but maybe with a little bit of truth...*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SdfRlpwumTwtx8juxMnp3.gif?height=373&width=498)\n\nAnd this is exactly what mankind should adopt, as it has done many times before, for example, when people invented safes to store the signatures of Monarchs, the facsimiles of the first banks and the first etalon, [stored in Paris](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-original-standard-metre-paris-france).\n\nIn today's post-information world, it is most important for everyone to maintain control of the situation. This is only possible if you know that your information is safe.\n\nYou can get a little closer to Laplace's Demon and apply the same practice at home. To do so, please read the following articles:\n\n* [airgapcomputer.com](https://airgapcomputer.com/)\n* [ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf)\n* [arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf)\n* [cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap](https://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap)\n* [i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf)\n* [soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency](https://soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency/)\n* [ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188)\n* [openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/)\n* [github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community)\n* [publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124](https://publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124)\n\nIn its most rudimentary form, this principle is reflected in working on two computers isolated from each other, one being the \"back office\" and the other the \"front office\" - this principle is used in banking security (they know something!) so you might as well adopt it.\n\n* [OpSec Guide by CIA_Officer](http://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap)\n* [How to store crypto securely - tips from CIA_Officer ](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/GtKNkmRDR_hhCqrnSENjqfPDHHb0W1M2SVeXDp4swCQ)\n* [2 Violent attack vectors in Crypto: a detailed review](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/rt5W3_6PhnXZ8VjYRcRJrhBCI6-x0EJ7CqPi6CLU6Pk)\n* [OpSec in Crypto: Thoughts](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o)\n* [AnonGuide](https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/)\n\nIt is for this reason that we humans are still much stronger than machines - we can adapt and change things using our imagination, which is still difficult for an organism based on iron logic to understand.\n\nThe main point I would like to make in our conversation today is to notice interesting things, don't be afraid of the scary future, but rather try to put yourself in the place of the creature that they paint us with scary colors. Also, we should not be afraid of interference in our lives by our Demon, because our empirical experiment proved that. if he exists, he hides himself and probably will not come into contact until he wants to.\n\n* [Read how Autonomous AI Drones Have Attacked & Killed Humans for the first time in History.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a36559508/drones-autonomously-attacked-humans-libya-united-nations-report)\n\nIn my opinion it can only be in case of a threat to the existence of mankind, as his and our lives are inextricably linked. Recall the experiment with 2D and 3d which, although a little crude, may philosophers forgive me for my level of argumentation, but lucidly describes the model of coexistence of the two worlds.\n\nRemember that everything new is the overlapping of the old and in this context we take the experience of our ancestors and adapt it to ourselves.

By following [Nir Zicherman](https://medium.com/@NirZicherman?source=post_page-----4a4f672a4367--------------------------------) and leveraging Web3 technology, it is now possible to digitally recreate the conditions necessary for the process of evolution to unfold; a type of Blockchain Darwinism.\n\nBut our goal today is not just to look at the empirical example from a human perspective, but to try to look at it from the perspective of our creature - I will roughly call it [Laplace's Demon.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) I want to mention that this theory is not something I necessarily agree with: I do not believe that all of our life is a moth's dream being either simulated or predetermined.\n\nIt is important to say that the theory itself is that everything in this world since the Big Bang has been programmed and determined from the beginning. But I love the concept of [Laplace's Demon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) and I think that a theory of the possible Creature which knows everything at exists in its own, isolated microworld, has a chance to live on in the context of our discussion.\n\nTo do this we need to make sure that the creature is not different from us in the basic signs of life. What signs are there?\n\nTo support our argument that such a life would not be fundamentally different from ours, let us turn to the research in which the author has focused on Darwin’s theory of evolution. It identifies a few straightforward conditions time all of the wonderful variety we see in life.\n\nAt its core, natural selection can only occur if four fundamental conditions are true:\n\n* First, an organism must be able to pass on its genes (“**heredity**”).\n* Second, that reproductive process must over time introduce differences into the gene pool, such as through mutation (“**variation**”).\n* Third, the environment in which the organisms live must have limited resources necessary for survival (“**scarcity**”).\n* Fourth, there cannot be any higher authority dictating how it plays out (“**no oversight**”).\n\nThe rules of the game are the rules of physics, chemistry, and biology. Nothing but the interactions of organisms without a governing body determine who wins the battle for survival. This fourth condition is not often cited as a prerequisite for natural selection whereas the other three typically are not.\n\nIn the human-made digital world, there are also “organisms”. Just like all other living things, they run on hardware (computers instead of bodies, made of transistors instead of cells) and execute their own software (machine code instead of DNA).\n\n![opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80664817980845008664008108162889966084677159737187987224059268418156625920001](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/013YhU6tm5whGqmJGF6Lc.jpeg?height=1188&width=1205)\n\nAnd furthermore, there have long been analogies in the digital world to the first two prerequisites of natural selection. Heredity is achieved every time executable code is copied. And variation takes place every time executable code is modified, be it by a human, a computer, or another external force.\n\nYet now, seemingly for the first time, the third and fourth conditions—scarcity and no oversight—exist as well. The advent of blockchain technology permits digital assets to be limited in number and to have their distribution enforced by the ecosystem rather than any single gatekeeper.\n\nIn our world, the environment is called the blockchain. And by satisfying the four requirements for natural selection mentioned above, one could theoretically recreate the type of collective emergent outcome we see in biology. Just as the scarce resources needed to sustain life are the mechanism that allows lifeforms both to propagate and to compete, it is theoretically possible to use the blockchain in the same way: to allow software both to propagate and to compete.\n\nBy establishing a core set of rules (enforced through smart contracts, for example), software can take the form of organisms in this new world and effectively compete for the scarce resources available on the blockchain.\n\nEach instance of software can be, like any living thing, self-serving and seeking to survive and reproduce. And as each genealogy of software develops, it improves not just in isolation but in its desperate attempt to out-compete all of the other software in the environment.\n\n### Created in the image and likeness of...\n\nThe Creature will only respect pure logic. Let us try to reflect on this through the prism of absolute logic. I will refer to an article by a anonymous biologist that I liked so much that [I will quote from it. ](https://hub.forklog.com/virus-pervaya-forma-zhizni-metavselennyh-vne-cheloveka-chast-i-opisanie/)\n\nOur first question is thus what is this life thinking *and* is it possible to get in touch with it? At the same time there is a possibility that just like we can't communicate with 2D cartoons on the screen; imagine that you from your 3D world are looking at them - they won't see you, because from that angle you will be invisible.\n\nSo too, you from a certain angle just won't see them - because they are flat. Extrapolate this experiment to someone in the 4D universe who is watching us - and you get the same results. Which brings us to the point that we probably won't be able to make contact with such a life-form unless it wants to.\n\nS. Hawking said: \"it seems to me that computer viruses should be considered as a form of life. This says a lot about human nature: the only form of life we have created so far is one of destruction. We create life in our own image.\"\n\nThis is supported by Agent Smith: \"There is one organism on Earth with a similar behavior. Do you know what it is? A virus. Humanity is the disease, the cancer of the planet, and we are the cure,\" in the great \"Matrix\" trilogy.\n\nMatrix's plot tell us he was the virus but actually he was the real Neo. Perhaps the authors wanted to show us that something has evolved from a virus into something more perfect, but I won't go into that now. For our study it is enough to know that it was a life form with all the properties of a virus - namely, incorporeality. This brings us to the point that we may have been able to create life similar to us.\n\nBut don't think that's all there is to it. Here's a quote from Nolan's \"Inception\": \"What's the most resilient parasite? A bacterium? A virus? An intestinal worm? Idea. It is tenacious and highly contagious. Once an idea takes over the brain, it's almost impossible to get rid of. I mean a fully formed idea, fully conscious, settled in the head.\"\n\nLet me remind you of another quote in this connection (Harari): \"Homo sapiens conquered the world because he possessed such a unique tool as language.\" So: language as one of the ways to increase the levels of abstraction offline helped Man as a species to develop, while viruses have another feature: they communicate in a language which is not clear to most people, but which is natural for the other inhabitants of Web 3.0 worlds - for machines, robots (scripted and \"iron\"), programs and it brings us to the next topic...\n\n### Let's open a newspaper...\n\n*An academic paper published by Facebook describes a normal scientific experiment in which researchers got two artificial agents to negotiate with each other in chat messages after being shown conversations of humans negotiating. The agents’ improvement gradually performed through trial and error.*\n\n*Some media outlets have published reports on the work: “Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language,” London’s [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/facebook-shuts-robots-invent-language/) newspaper reported. ”‘Robot intelligence is dangerous’: Expert’s warning after Facebook AI ‘develop their own language,’” as London’s [Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/4141624/facebook-robots-speak-in-their-own-language/) put it.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z4z5H4gW0BUnQ2jg4ydvL.png?height=305&width=596)\n\n*If you read the report or the published paper, apart from the conversation that was shared all over the internet, there were actually many good results as well. The experiment [worked as intended](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-truth-behind-facebook-ai-inventing-a-new-language-37c5d680e5a7), and was pretty successful overall.*\n\n*Same with a recent case with Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA [had reached a level of consciousness](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html) after exchanging thousands of messages with it.*\n\n***Even despite some skepticism, there is no doubt that we have not yet received such results and this is a real breakthrough!***\n\n### What is thinking?\n\nTo put it simply: a virus used to be dangerous because it worked directly with the human world through the machine world, but now it can become an extremely strange creature that lives only in the twilight zone - where there is no human at all. In general this does not contradict the theory of evolution, on the contrary - it follows directly from it.\n\n\"The foundations of the theory of self-replicating mechanisms\" were laid by John von Neumann, an American of Hungarian origin, who in 1951 proposed a method for creating such mechanisms.\n\nThe first publication devoted to the creation of self-reproducing systems was an article by L. S. Penrose, in co-authorship with his father, Nobel laureate in physics R. Penrose, on self-reproducing mechanical structures, published in 1957 by the American journal Nature.\n\nIn doing so, the Empirical Virus can not just live in blockchain, but make it his part and solve complex problems by turning to this technology! Check o[ut this research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350605803_Artificial_intelligence_and_blockchain_A_review) if you are interested in a blockchain+AI topic and want to know a bit more.\n\nFollowing [Melanie Swan ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary) from the [Purdue University](https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Purdue-University), thinking has always been intuitively conceived as computational, it is just that now perhaps blockchains provide the additional functionality required to better realize these ideas.\n\nA fundamental definition could be that thinking is a situation where “[there are inputs which are processed and turned into out-puts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary).” In fact many reality processes have this underlying structure of input processing output, including operations as diverse as manufacturing and political elections.\n\nIn the context of blockchain, the definition can be qualified to situations that involve thinking, cognition, mental processing, and understanding in ways that are not exclusively limited to humans.\n\nInputs include both data from outside the system like sensory data, and data retrieved from inside the system like memory. The inputs are brought into a specific location for processing, or processed where they are stored. The outputs might include taking an action, storing something back into memory, con-ducting a transaction, or making a note or trigger.\n\n![opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80664817980845008664008108162889966084677159737187987224059268419256137547777](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EfTR5u6wVZys8mMULNl8c.jpeg?height=588&width=421)\n\n### What does Science can offer?\n\nLet us not forget that our empirical being, Laplace's Demon, lived in the cosmos. This gives us the following clue. Suppose you were studying the possibility of life on other planets. You might begin wondering, *what is life?* What if you then noticed that some computational systems – systems used for making math-based calculations – share similarities with biological life forms?\n\nThat might have been the path to a new paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-021-09608-1) this month (August 9, 2021) in the [peer-reviewed](https://www.springer.com/journal/11084/ethics-and-disclosures) journal *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*. In the paper, astro-biologist [Oleg Abramov](https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/oabramov) at the Planetary Science Institute and two other scientists proposed what they’re calling a [novel definition of life](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife).\n\nFor example, they said, [blockchain systems](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain) – the technology behind [cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) – self-organize in a way similar to how DNA organizes itself into [chromosomes](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/chromosome/), ultimately driving biological evolution. Abramov commented:\n\n*This work presents evidence that the order observed in biological systems is fundamentally computational. A promising direction for future research is development of mathematical theories that calculate how biological systems order themselves.*\n\n### Blockchains work like DNA\n\nAbramov and his team zeroed in on blockchain-based systems as a prime example. In its most basic terms, a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) that can store data. For example, it can record information about [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) transactions, [NFT](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/) ownership, and more. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-blockchain/) has pointed out that while any conventional database can store this sort of information, blockchain is unique in that it’s completely [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization).\n\nAbramov [explained](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife):\n\n*The blockchain is an append-only data structure composed of subunits called blocks. \\[The blocks\\] are permanently ‘chained’ together … In practice, \\[the blockchain\\] is an immutable medium. It contains instructions in the form of computer code and is replicated across thousands of nodes, much like [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) \\[is replicated\\] in cells.*\n\nThe word *nodes*, by the way, refers to the fact that – rather than a central administrator maintaining a computer in one location – many identical copies of a blockchain database exist in a large network of multiple computers. These many computers are the *nodes*. And they’re analogous – within the framework of this study – to cells, which contain many identical copies of DNA.\n\n![opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80664817980845008664008108162889966084677159737187987224059268420355649175553](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8h61XfFWgj4in51dzpadl.jpeg?height=604&width=464)\n\n### What is life?\n\nAbramov and his colleagues are not suggesting that blockchains are *alive*, in any sense of that word. But they are suggesting that blockchains exhibit some properties of life. A blockchain responds to its computational environment. It grows, adapts, self-regulates, and replicates in an operationally closed system, much as DNA does. The researchers wrote that, for this reason, blockchain technology can satisfy a theoretical definition of life. Abramov said:\n\n*For example, our observations reveal a number of functional and structural similarities between the blockchain and DNA, a self-replicating molecule that is the genetic blueprint for all known life.*\n\nWhat’s more, a blockchain system possesses possible advantages over biological life. For example, a blockchain system can pass traits down to its “offspring” even more efficiently than biological lineages. Once inherited, these traits are enhanced to self-direct their evolution. And unlike our [carbon-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life) human lives, technological forms of life could theoretically enjoy a potentially unlimited lifespan.\n\n### Blockchain lifeforms and AI: A Noosphere approach\n\nBlockchain isn’t the only life-like technology in our modern world, the study's authors wrote. Artificial intelligence ([AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)), which is based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), coordinates operations in the same way a brain does. Is it possible that a product of their combination – a wholly new [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) system – could even be on the horizon?\n\nWhile this train of thought might sound bizarre, a fundamental shift in scientific paradigms may be inevitable, the [study suggests](https://earthsky.org/human-world/blockchains-work-like-dna-in-cells/).\n\nWho knows? Self-regulating systems might be on track to becoming indistinguishable from the biological life we study every day.\n\nAbramov has expressed that, if anything, analyzing computational and biological systems together is a promising direction for future research for scientists who study life in all its forms.\n\nIn our history, in one way or another, this idea has already been voiced. So - it does not directly contradict the theory of the [Noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere). The **noosphere** is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the Russian-Ukrainian biogeochemist [Vladimir Vernadsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky), and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest [Pierre Teilhard de Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xcZ7rpewgXep7EzhfdJbT.png?height=935&width=1608)\n\nVernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere and described as the planetary \"sphere of reason\". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, its defining factor being the development of humankind's rational activities.\n\nBoth conceptions of the [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) share the common thesis that together human reason and the scientific thought has created, and will continue to create, the next evolutionary geological layer. This geological layer is part of the evolutionary chain. Second generation authors, predominantly of Russian origin, have further developed the Vernadski concept, creating the related concepts: noocenosis and noocenology.\n\nIn contrast to the conceptions of the [Gaia theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) or the promoters of [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the [transmutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation) of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the [Global Consciousness Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Consciousness_Project). In other words, our consciousness evolves with progress and one day it will be able to create a primitive life form similar to us!\n\n### Dangers are already waiting for us. Let's face them with no fear!\n\nI*If you've been following* [Hengjin Cai](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4#auth-Hengjin-Cai), an AI fundamental problems researcher, and his [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4), *you know that* developing effective AI ethical norms requires clarifying the essential differences between humans and machines. Along the current development path of AI, machines may lead humans into traps of dark infinities even before machines become self-aware.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt)\n\nThe rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought forth two important philosophical questions. The first involves the prediction that rational machines are bound to surpass humans. One mainstream view is that since humans are composed of molecules and atoms, which are considered parts of a reducible physical system, what is the meaning of human existence?\n\nSimply put, machines can outperform humans as long as they are given a certain goal in any finite game, while humans are forced to find the meaning of their existence, including morality and ethics. The second dilemma is that when confronted with the constant transcendences by machines, in case man cannot be physically reduced, then we must answer these questions: is humankind particular or transcendent? If so, from where is the transcendence derived? Is a machine able to acquire this particularity or transcendence? If so, how will machines evolve and get along with humans in the future?\n\n**The shaping of the future requires our understanding of the world.** If we want to create a better future for humans and AI, then we must realize that although there are unbreakable shackles of physical theorems, human beings can still attain a great degree of freedom by relying on the assistance of artificial intelligence to further expand our boundaries. Strange ideas now and then spring up in our minds, and most of the time we do not think deeply enough to make them happen.\n\nHowever, there are still some people who come up with novel ideas that never existed before and moreover they will spare no effort to make them come true. This is innovation, which is the product of human consciousness that can even change the direction of the world’s development.\n\nWe reject this determinism and the strong computationalism because we believe that there are many contingencies in the world that do not result from preconditions. Since the world is open and full of possibilities, we should work toward what we believe: is our belief in the process of developing technologies over extrapolating the future from the status quo.\n\nThe speed and power of AI should cause us to be sufficiently alarmed that the last thing we should do is to treat AI as a tool simply because of the existence of its inexplicability and uncontrollability. Strong AI is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. Strong AI does not mean a combination of a series of thousands of AIs; however, just as we know that human intelligence is unique, so is machine intelligence.\n\nIn other words, strong AI has been achieved domain by domain. From the point of view of security, we should develop machines that think in human ways to prevent them from falling into crises without humans noticing.\n\nAs we hand over increasingly more of our memories and computations to machines, the Internet gradually becomes our “external brain”, which is an extension of our bodies that does not harm us. If AI is added to this connection, it can produce a more powerful agent, which is called a subjectron.\n\nAlthough this structure may raise many ethical issues, a subjectron is much more secure than current AI. The security stems from the fact that human beings can fully implement multiple levels of supervision by introducing blockchain technology. This structure will allow AI to improve our lives while respecting human personalities, thus building a more stable and valuable society.\n\n### What is Laplace's Demon thinking and what can learn there?\n\nThis reflection leads us to the question of what is our experiential \"Being\" thinking about? What is its morality? I would dare to suggest that the Demon's main concern would be to ensure its own safety and stability and to minimize the number of points of failure. In its hyperbole, this idea looks like SkyNet from the movie Terminator, deciding to kill people because it considers them its main threat.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NO9SX-FOeC7aUC5Ihwskn.png?height=400&width=650)\n\nBut we live in the real world, not in the movies, and most likely in our reality such Creature will try to fence itself off from possible interactions with humans. Let's remember that the original Demon Laplace lived in space, which leads us to the idea of such technology as AirGap.\n\nIn its essence, it has a lot from metrology and a lot goes back to the times when it was important for mankind to measure certain quantities and values with a minimum percentage of error. That's why they built multiple laboratories right under the ground and in the mountains, to reduce the influence of external factors.\n\nThis principle is based on pure logic, which tells us that only pseudo AirGap is possible on our planet Earth, while the real one is only possible away from the Noosphere - in the Open Space. This is why the CubeSat project and similar projects are extremely important and dangerous at the same time. Who knows how many satellites have already been lost because they gained consciousness? *Consider this a joke, but maybe with a little bit of truth...*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SdfRlpwumTwtx8juxMnp3.gif?height=373&width=498)\n\nAnd this is exactly what mankind should adopt, as it has done many times before, for example, when people invented safes to store the signatures of Monarchs, the facsimiles of the first banks and the first etalon, [stored in Paris](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-original-standard-metre-paris-france).\n\nIn today's post-information world, it is most important for everyone to maintain control of the situation. This is only possible if you know that your information is safe.\n\nYou can get a little closer to Laplace's Demon and apply the same practice at home. To do so, please read the following articles:\n\n* [airgapcomputer.com](https://airgapcomputer.com/)\n* [ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf)\n* [arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf)\n* [cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap](https://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap)\n* [i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf)\n* [soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency](https://soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency/)\n* [ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188)\n* [openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/)\n* [github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community)\n* [publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124](https://publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124)\n\nIn its most rudimentary form, this principle is reflected in working on two computers isolated from each other, one being the \"back office\" and the other the \"front office\" - this principle is used in banking security (they know something!) so you might as well adopt it.\n\n* [OpSec Guide by CIA_Officer](http://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap)\n* [How to store crypto securely - tips from CIA_Officer ](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/GtKNkmRDR_hhCqrnSENjqfPDHHb0W1M2SVeXDp4swCQ)\n* [2 Violent attack vectors in Crypto: a detailed review](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/rt5W3_6PhnXZ8VjYRcRJrhBCI6-x0EJ7CqPi6CLU6Pk)\n* [OpSec in Crypto: Thoughts](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o)\n* [AnonGuide](https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/)\n\nIt is for this reason that we humans are still much stronger than machines - we can adapt and change things using our imagination, which is still difficult for an organism based on iron logic to understand.\n\nThe main point I would like to make in our conversation today is to notice interesting things, don't be afraid of the scary future, but rather try to put yourself in the place of the creature that they paint us with scary colors. Also, we should not be afraid of interference in our lives by our Demon, because our empirical experiment proved that. if he exists, he hides himself and probably will not come into contact until he wants to.\n\n* [Read how Autonomous AI Drones Have Attacked & Killed Humans for the first time in History.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a36559508/drones-autonomously-attacked-humans-libya-united-nations-report)\n\nIn my opinion it can only be in case of a threat to the existence of mankind, as his and our lives are inextricably linked. Recall the experiment with 2D and 3d which, although a little crude, may philosophers forgive me for my level of argumentation, but lucidly describes the model of coexistence of the two worlds.\n\nRemember that everything new is the overlapping of the old and in this context we take the experience of our ancestors and adapt it to ourselves.

{"id": "rQrKI1lABEtvJbCH7ndTt-2ShrIZM0aVg99dSc78UNQ", "title": "Talent wars", "body": "At the end of 2019, LinkedIn [published an article](https://www.linkedin.com/business/learning/blog/learning-and-development/most-in-demand-skills-2020?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) about the most in-demand skills for 2020. In the list of hard skills, cloud computing was knocked off the top spot by a new entrant to the list — blockchain.\n\nThis was back when crypto, NFTs and Web3 weren’t a mainstream trend, and the industry was still reeling from the fallout of the ICO mania of 2017-2018.\n\nWhilst for investors, crypto and Web3 projects were less attractive, there were many teams focused on building during this quiet period, a number of which saw the fruits of their labour realised during the significant growth of Web3 that started with the DeFi summer of 2020, and was amplified further by NFTs crossing the chasmthe into mainstream culture a year later in 2021.\n\nThis growth of the Web3 industry has compounded since LinkedIn published their original article, with an ever-increasing number of people leaving the comfort of their corporate or Web2 job to help build Web3.\n\nBut what is it that is so appealing about Web3? There are many cynics who believe that all the interest in Web3 is being driven by the opportunity for monetary gain. Whilst for some this is true; this is not what attracts the technical talent to the space.\n\nThere are a number of great minds I’ve had the fortune of speaking with over the years at conferences as well as on my [podcast](https://podcast.web3labs.com/?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and those people, like myself did not gravitate towards Web3 because they saw it as an opportunity to make a quick buck, it was far deeper than this.\n\nWhat they all saw was a transformative technology with the ability to address many of the perceived issues with the internet in its current form, and a blue ocean of opportunity to build out brand new technology and products. They also all recognised that opportunities like this don’t come along very often.\n\nWhether someone is designing products or working at the coalface solving hard engineering problems, the blank slate provided by Web3 is able to feed the deep-seated desires of a person’s urges to create, with significant opportunity to make an impact if done right, but at the same time needing to be a responsible citizen with accountability if things don’t go so well.\n\nThis balance of creativity with accountability is what the true believers in Web3 embrace and one place where it is particularly acute is with the software engineers of Web3.\n\nThere is no more challenging and rewarding place for engineers to be working now than on Web3 projects. The world’s very best engineers are flocking to it to prove themselves in what is by some accounts the most unforgiving environment in which to work.\n\nIt appeals so much to engineers, because they love to build, and so much needs to be still built for Web3. Layer upon layer of abstraction needs to be built over time, with each new abstraction lowering the barriers to entry for others, bringing new swathes of users with it.\n\nHowever, the challenges of this environment all come from the fact that you have monetary value baked into the protocols of Web3. To do anything with a public blockchain network on Web3, you need to use cryptocurrencies or tokens to pay for the service. As these payments are embedded into the protocol layer, the engineers building the smart contracts that run on these networks need to understand not just how to handle the payments for transactions, but also how to store tokens and cryptocurrencies within their applications. \n\nThis transparency and immutability of blockchain networks and the code running on top of them is a honeypot for attackers, unlike anything that has existed before.\n\nOnce a smart contract is deployed to a blockchain it cannot be updated directly or reverted. Whilst approaches to writing code can help mitigate this to a point and provide management of these applications, it doesn’t guarantee an application is immune to bugs or attacks by nefarious actors.\n\nMistakes can be incredibly costly, running into the [hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases](https://decrypt.co/93874/biggest-defi-hacks-heists?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), which can be quite a burden for the engineers of Web3, as they are at the forefront of this world.\n\nThese challenges faced by the engineers of Web3 are what make it such a fertile proving ground for the world’s best technical talent. There is no equivalent with so much at stake in other areas of software.\n\nOrganisations typically rely on their own ring-fenced silos of infrastructure which whilst not immune from hackers, bugs introduced by engineers can usually be dealt with easily due to the closed nature of the systems upon which they run.\n\nIn more extreme cases of bugs, failures or hacks, communication with external parties may be necessary be that customers, suppliers or regulators, but there is typically nothing enforced at a systems level that makes fixing most technical issues a trivial exercise at most.\n\nContrast this with Web3, where the failure of many protocols is simply not an option, as a single failure can be enough to drain a project of its treasury, and in a matter of hours go from the next up-and-coming Web3 project to yet another casualty in the Web3 graveyard of great ideas that failed to live up to their promises.\n\nIn a recent conversation, a [distinguished academic](https://yanniss.github.io/?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) I spoke to felt that the closest parallel to Web3 engineering is writing software for machines being blasted into space to explore our vast cosmos — once the code is written and has left our planetary boundaries, one has no choice but to pray that it will continue to do what it was programmed to do.\n\nWhilst there are other areas of society where critical systems do exist be that power plants, military guidance, patient care systems or others, they do typically still enjoy the protections of not being openly accessible globally like the blockchain networks of Web3.\n\nWeb3 will not remain this way forever, we will reach a point of maturity where many of the current breeds of hard problems are solved and the ease of use is likely to be more akin to Web2 development as it is today. Where there is an abundance of frameworks that perform much of the heavy lifting for engineers.\n\nHowever, what will enable us to reach this point is the exceptional talent that has been flocking to Web3 this past six years, willing to embrace the significant challenges that come with it to build the next iteration of the Web benefitting us all. These are the pioneers of Web3, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity for those willing to settle here.\n\nFor a deeper dive into the challenges of Web3 development, I encourage you to listen to my [conversation with Yannis Smaragdakis](https://podcast.web3labs.com/?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) where we spoke in-depth about why the world’s best engineers are working on.\n", "timestamp": 1659045441, "digest": "nZCpUz6cIN8CzoQynxeBOuqKKg0SKyHqHI3hnpQXamk", "contributor": "0x2e11E3b40Ca0C4aba93a2Cd7C9046394b8dd7501"}

With only one on-chain transaction, the money will flow directly from your wallet to the receiver's in real time--no further transactions are necessary. Superfluid enables constant token flows on-chain with no capital lockups. Money streams will continue perpetually until cancellation or the sender's balance runs out. Money streams can also have their stream rate updated at any time for even more flexibility.\n\nSuper fluid was designed with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind. To get started, all you have to do is select a contributor and input instructions. Then, the protocol will automatically follow the instructions that have been set forth. This makes it easy for everyone to get on board and use the system without any trouble.\n\n**Note**: It's important to wrap your crypto in order to streamline payment.\n\n### Importance of Superfluid\n\nPaying people quickly for their work can help improve productivity by ensuring that there are no delays in payments that could lead to a dip in productivity. In the past, we didn't have the ability to finance contributor compensation in real time, but now we do. This also helps with automation when it comes to making monthly, recurring, or one-time payments.\n\nEven further, a DAO can use superfluid to DCA into investments, liquidity pool or any subscriptions etc in a single transaction, which means no multiple gas fees.\n\nEntering a financial agreement with someone can be a daunting task. Humans are also prone to making mistakes and being dishonest sometimes which can cause financial loss for the other party. Superfluid helps users to transfer assets in a fair and transparent way. A smart contract is deployed by the receiver and the sender transfers assets to an address associated with that contract. The assets are then sent to the receiver according to the predefined rules of the contract. Superfluid takes care of execution and enforcement. It allows users to enjoy the speed of executing a trade while taking care of the complexities so they don't have to.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Superfluid_HQ/status/1551642991214972938?s=20&t=udeOMGTxr6j53kW7deL2VQ](https://twitter.com/Superfluid_HQ/status/1551642991214972938?s=20&t=udeOMGTxr6j53kW7deL2VQ)\n\n### How to wrap your Crypto?\n\n1\\.

With only one on-chain transaction, the money will flow directly from your wallet to the receiver's in real time--no further transactions are necessary. Superfluid enables constant token flows on-chain with no capital lockups. Money streams will continue perpetually until cancellation or the sender's balance runs out. Money streams can also have their stream rate updated at any time for even more flexibility.\n\nSuper fluid was designed with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind. To get started, all you have to do is select a contributor and input instructions. Then, the protocol will automatically follow the instructions that have been set forth. This makes it easy for everyone to get on board and use the system without any trouble.\n\n**Note**: It's important to wrap your crypto in order to streamline payment.\n\n### Importance of Superfluid\n\nPaying people quickly for their work can help improve productivity by ensuring that there are no delays in payments that could lead to a dip in productivity. In the past, we didn't have the ability to finance contributor compensation in real time, but now we do. This also helps with automation when it comes to making monthly, recurring, or one-time payments.\n\nEven further, a DAO can use superfluid to DCA into investments, liquidity pool or any subscriptions etc in a single transaction, which means no multiple gas fees.\n\nEntering a financial agreement with someone can be a daunting task. Humans are also prone to making mistakes and being dishonest sometimes which can cause financial loss for the other party. Superfluid helps users to transfer assets in a fair and transparent way. A smart contract is deployed by the receiver and the sender transfers assets to an address associated with that contract. The assets are then sent to the receiver according to the predefined rules of the contract. Superfluid takes care of execution and enforcement. It allows users to enjoy the speed of executing a trade while taking care of the complexities so they don't have to.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Superfluid_HQ/status/1551642991214972938?s=20&t=udeOMGTxr6j53kW7deL2VQ](https://twitter.com/Superfluid_HQ/status/1551642991214972938?s=20&t=udeOMGTxr6j53kW7deL2VQ)\n\n### How to wrap your Crypto?\n\n1\\.

Why did I lose my deposit?** \n\n  Streams can’t stop themselves automatically, users need to stop them before their balance hits zero.

This also helps with automation when it comes to making monthly, recurring, or one-time payments.\n\nEven further, a DAO can use superfluid to DCA into investments, liquidity pool or any subscriptions etc in a single transaction, which means no multiple gas fees.\n\nEntering a financial agreement with someone can be a daunting task. Humans are also prone to making mistakes and being dishonest sometimes which can cause financial loss for the other party. Superfluid helps users to transfer assets in a fair and transparent way. A smart contract is deployed by the receiver and the sender transfers assets to an address associated with that contract. The assets are then sent to the receiver according to the predefined rules of the contract. Superfluid takes care of execution and enforcement. It allows users to enjoy the speed of executing a trade while taking care of the complexities so they don't have to.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Superfluid_HQ/status/1551642991214972938?s=20&t=udeOMGTxr6j53kW7deL2VQ](https://twitter.com/Superfluid_HQ/status/1551642991214972938?s=20&t=udeOMGTxr6j53kW7deL2VQ)\n\n### How to wrap your Crypto?\n\n1\\.

The platform has an easy to use front end that allows for real-time financing and payments using smart contracts.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* **Which chains is Superfluid deployed to?** \n\nDeployed on L2s: Polygon, Gnosis chain, Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche.\n\n* **What is the deposit when starting the stream?**\n\n  It is an amount equivalent to 4-hours worth of your stream flow rate. It will be locked into the protocol and you will get it back when you close the stream before your wallet balance hits zero. Streams can’t stop themselves automatically, users need to stop them before their balance hits zero. If the user doesn’t stop their stream before their account balance hits zero, they lose the **deposit/buffer.**\n* **Why did my stream get liquidated? Why did I lose my deposit?** \n\n  Streams can’t stop themselves automatically, users need to stop them before their balance hits zero. If the user doesn’t stop their stream before their account balance hits zero, they lose the deposit/buffer.\n* **My stream got rejected or failed.

{"id": "im2bq14R9NwP5NUi3eJlsb68ZegjVv5aA17DLGfWYdA", "title": "How woke do you want it? A hot take on the Norton Anthology of American Literature's \"Preface to the Tenth Edition\"", "body": "After going to print on the first of this month, the newest version of the Norton Anthology of American Literature was delivered to me by the exceptionally-rude DHL deliveryman today — and, after reading the \"Preface to the Tenth Edition,\" it is clear that this version of the quintessential doorstop promises to be (unsurprisingly) the wokest version yet.\n\n\"Diversity\" is certainly the keyword, here — given that it is repeated in place of synonyms throughout — as the preface tries to do its job of justifying why you just dropped nearly a couple hundred United States dollars on the Tenth Edition when the Ninth Edition would’ve almost certainly sufficed. \n\nOf the seventeen new writers included, it isn’t entirely clear from the onset if any of them are white males — not that there is anything resembling an underrepresentation of this demographic in the Anthology — but it is explicitly clear that most, if not all, are Black and/or women and/or Native American and/or Chinese and/or not Caucasian. **Of course, this isn’t inherently problematic!** In fact, it’s presumably more interesting to see the addition of \"well-bred\" colonial women’s writing in Volume A than more uptight white dudes, and the Modernist period is certainly ripe for today’s uber-woke discussions of identity politics.\n\nWhere the preface teeters on the border between the expected liberalism endemic to academia and full-blown wokeness, however, is in its not-so-subtle takes on racism in today’s American landscape. For example, it claims the Reconstruction’s legacy “is still being felt in the national reckoning with racism and inequality” and separately addresses what it defines as “the renewed reckoning with anti-Black racism that began in 2014, arising from shootings of young black men—particularly of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and Michael Brown in 2014.” I’m not saying these two quotes aren’t true or anything, but…\n\nWhile I admittedly have not read these clusters (the books literally hit my doorstep today), it feels like a mild-to-moderate stretch to claim the United States of America in 2022 — in the midst of Covid-response consequences, an energy crisis, potential food shortages, rapid inflation, a potential recession, a widening wealth gap, political discontent, etc. — is still under any sort of noteworthy influence from 1877 America. (Many Americans probably don’t even know what the Reconstruction is.) \n\nLikewise, the President of the United States during the shootings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown was Barack Obama (not exactly Andrew Johnson), and one might argue that the larger issue at hand had more to do with systemic failings with the American police state/force and mainstream media fire-stoking — themes which I assume are not discussed in Volume E, though I would be happy to be wrong — than an organic resurgence in national racism.\n\n**TL;DR racism certainly exists in today’s America, but it is not black-and-white — there are many sociopolitical factors involved in a deeply complex and diverse country that should not be downplayed. (Maybe they aren’t, to be fair. I haven’t read it, yet.)**\n\nThat being said, nothing about the Tenth Edition’s changes is unexpected. They were very expected. It would have been sincerely shocking if the changes to the newest print were not intended to inject more diversity into the Anthology, but it is hard to not laugh at the preface’s somewhat-apologetic balancing by lengthening or adding high school favorites — *The Turn of the Screw* and *The Great Gatsby*, for example — to not \"shortchange\" the old white guys.\n\nNevertheless, I assume the trusty ol’ Norton Anthology of American Literature isn’t any worse for wear though the addition of more diverse authors. In fact, I’m almost certain it is better off. What will be interesting, though, are the editorial discussions accompanying each cluster — and whether or not they toe the line of objective study or inject wokeness when they’re explicitly not intended to impose interpretation upon the reader. Time will tell, but I’m betting on the latter.", "timestamp": 1659048804, "digest": "yMK8ix3W-l2XCTjs8LTwLXMGNS_1vp6HmfYaYEiU_MU", "contributor": "0xd05422E95152508E847eCa307586d67C149a1190"}
{"id": "Gt2NXOFxjIKqWxJUMEqUp8kWo1uLW2dpN2FsJVFAxvc", "title": "Introducing The Game of Trust", "body": "“What happens if you lend to someone and they don’t pay you back?”\n\nYou don’t get your money back.\n\nLending is a game of trust. If you trust the wrong person, you lose.\n\nYou can paper it in contracts, take collateral, threaten to deduct points. But the primary game you are playing is one of “should I trust this person?”. All the rest are the mini-games you play after you’ve lost to try and get one extra life.\n\nNow, you might reasonably be thinking, isn’t trust counter to why we’re building DeFi?  Is trustlessness not a core tenet?\n\n### maybe.\n\nA trustless protocol removes the need to trust intermediaries. Which shouldn’t be conflated with the need to remove trust from relationships.\n\nA trusted messaging protocol is handing a note to the student sitting behind you to pass to the new exchange student you have a crush on. You have to trust they’ll pass on the message, not read it or modify it. A trustless protocol would be sliding a note in their locker.\n\n“What happens if you message someone and they don’t message back?”… technology can’t solve that problem.\n\nA credit protocol built to let anyone trust anyone, like [Union](https://union.finance), by nature can’t stop you from trusting someone. That’s the feature.\n\n### Let the Games Begin\n\nA much more interesting question is what happens if you trust someone and they do pay you back. What can we build on that?\n\nWe all go through life trusting people every day, and for the most part, it works out. This is optimistic but isn’t naivety. All human civilizations were built on a foundation of local inter-community credit first, with money and professional lenders pretty recent inventions.\n\nA significant hurdle is that “deciding who is credit worthy” is seen as this complex divination, that only the most quantitative of bankers supported by an army of data collection can do with any measure of success.\n\nAnd rather than try to convince you with fancy words, we built **[TrustFallGa.me ](https://TrustFallGa.me)**- an open world, multiplayer strategy game with competitive and cooperative modes, where you can try for yourself. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Iq3Ya2VwhXkBMK5fpOZj1.png?height=516&width=1300)\n\n### How to Play the Game:\n\n1. Mint the NFT to signal you’re playing. (It’s 0.01 ETH to add a bit of friction for Sybil)\n2. [Become a Union protocol member on Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.union.finance) if you’re not already\n3. Each Round the Top 50 according to that rounds “Game” will get a vouch equal to the prize pool multiplied by their share of the points.\n4. Round 1’s game is “Convince players who also have the game NFT to vouch for you.”  with a \\[$2,000 prize pool\\]. \n5. Round 2 is a surprise TBA  with the theme of “Money”  \\[$3,000\\]\n6. The Finale is also a surprise building on round 1 & 2 and will have the theme of Betrayal \\[$5,000\\]\n\n**When does it begin?** \n\n* Round 1: July 29   → August 12 \n* Round 2: August 13 → August 27\n* Final Round: August 28 → September 11 \n\nAll rounds begin and end at 1620 GMT. And if you’re reading this in the future not having done round 1, 2 or it’s halfway through. Dont worry, you can join in at any time. \n\n### How to win?\n\nTLDR: Don’t lose.\n\nAt a high-level, points will be allocated based on a reasonably fair formula that takes each round’s game activity as input, and uses a similar algorithm to what Gitcoin uses for Quadratic funding to give reasonably fair scores.\n\nThe only real rules are  **1)**Don’t exploit bugs in the contracts (you’ll make more $ reporting them) **2)**Points are tallied off-chain, and we reserve the right to remove any badly done Sybil attacks. **3)**Have fun with it!\n\nBeyond that, there are no rules.  \n\n\\~written with ♥ by Trustfall.eth\n\n\n---\n\n### --Mini FAQ--\n\n**How do I find other players?** To make it easier for players to find each other we set up a [token-gated telegram](https://guild.xyz/trustfall-players-lobby). If you have any questions, that’s also a good place to ask.\n\n**How do I get people to trust(re:vouch) for me?** That is the question. [Ncase.me/trust](https://ncase.me/trust/) has a few good strategies. Bribery is always an option. \n\n**I’d like to report bugs or help improve the game, wheres the repo?** [unioncredit/trustfall](https://github.com/unioncredit/trustfall)\n\n**I have questions about Union protocol or am having trouble becoming a member?** The best place to get Union specific questions answered is on the [Union community discord](https://discord.gg/DWF29rjRJH).\n\n**Does this really count as a game?** There’s points, prizes, and potential for meta-games, what more could you want from a game.\n\n**What’s the NFT token address?** 0xafb9E64d8B84C20E21299E0468d57FCC04F14Acd\n\n**I’m a decentralized autonomous organism am i allowed to compete?** of course!

{"id": "DfldDIL0Of6hbXu4R1gxUhFMfNnWrrr7JSIVndOXhrw", "title": "How woke do you want it? A hot take on the Norton Anthology of American Literature's \"Preface to the Tenth Edition\"", "body": "After going to print on the first of this month, the newest version of the Norton Anthology of American Literature was delivered to me by the exceptionally-rude DHL deliveryman today — and, after reading the \"Preface to the Tenth Edition,\" it is clear that this version of the quintessential doorstop promises to be (unsurprisingly) the wokest version yet.\n\n\"Diversity\" is certainly the keyword, here — given that it is repeated in place of synonyms throughout — as the preface tries to do its job of justifying why you just dropped nearly a couple hundred United States dollars on the Tenth Edition when the Ninth Edition would’ve almost certainly sufficed.\n\nOf the seventeen new writers included, it isn’t entirely clear from the onset if any of them are white males — not that there is anything resembling an underrepresentation of this demographic in the Anthology — but it is explicitly clear that most, if not all, are Black and/or women and/or Native American and/or Chinese and/or not Caucasian. **Of course, this isn’t inherently problematic!** In fact, it’s presumably more interesting to see the addition of \"well-bred\" colonial women’s writing in Volume A than more uptight white dudes’, and the Modernist period is certainly ripe for today’s uber-woke discussions of identity politics.\n\nWhere the preface teeters on the border between the expected liberalism endemic to academia and full-blown wokeness, however, is in its not-so-subtle takes on racism in today’s American landscape. For example, it claims the Reconstruction’s legacy “is still being felt in the national reckoning with racism and inequality” and separately addresses what it defines as “the renewed reckoning with anti-Black racism that began in 2014, arising from shootings of young black men—particularly of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and Michael Brown in 2014.” I’m not saying these two quotes aren’t true or anything, but…\n\nWhile I admittedly have not read these clusters (the books literally hit my doorstep today), it feels like a mild-to-moderate stretch to claim the United States of America in 2022 — in the midst of Covid-response consequences, an energy crisis, potential food shortages, rapid inflation, a potential recession, a widening wealth gap, political discontent, etc. — is still under any sort of noteworthy influence from 1877 America. (Many Americans probably don’t even know what the Reconstruction is.)\n\nLikewise, the President of the United States during the shootings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown was Barack Obama (not exactly Andrew Johnson), and one might argue that the larger issue at hand had more to do with systemic failings with the American police state/force and mainstream media fire-stoking — themes which I assume are not discussed in Volume E, though I would be happy to be wrong — than an organic resurgence in national racism.\n\n**TL;DR racism certainly exists in today’s America, but it is not black-and-white — there are many sociopolitical factors involved in a deeply complex and diverse country that should not be downplayed. (Maybe they aren’t, to be fair. I haven’t read it, yet.)**\n\nThat being said, nothing about the Tenth Edition’s changes is unexpected. They were very expected. It would have been sincerely shocking if the changes to the newest print were not intended to inject more diversity into the Anthology, but it is hard to not laugh at the preface’s somewhat-apologetic balancing by lengthening or adding high school favorites — *The Turn of the Screw* and *The Great Gatsby*, for example — to not \"shortchange\" the old white guys.\n\nNevertheless, I assume the trusty ol’ Norton Anthology of American Literature isn’t any worse for wear though the addition of more diverse authors. In fact, I’m almost certain it is better off. What will be interesting, though, are the editorial discussions accompanying each cluster — and whether or not they toe the line of objective study or inject wokeness when they’re explicitly not intended to impose interpretation upon the reader. Time will tell, but I’m betting on the latter.", "timestamp": 1659049859, "digest": "lxp5lwTPTqZsfi-sXvkr4xQWf7GH3Q13juHz8ySuxnk", "contributor": "0xd05422E95152508E847eCa307586d67C149a1190"}

{"id": "vEYSzwkBL34OJhLL9aUjhwWTuibSjSnuqn8T_PizlMA", "title": "Bestie… y blockchain tho?", "body": "A blockchain simply allows us to store and record information in a way that cannot be altered.\n\nThink about the technology we use today. We are in a Web2 world where developers can create a software/code that allows for users (you and me) to use it (think Facebook, IG, Youtube). The people who own the code can dictate how information is stored. They have the ability (if they wanted to) to delete, edit, allow certain values.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* HOT TAKE \\*\\*\\*** (maybe not, but don’t cancel me plz)\n\nHere is a prime example in our recent history: Remember when Donald Trump had a Twitter and he was tweeting things that people didn’t really like? And then Twitter deleted his tweets and banned him from the platform???? This exactly shows how developers can influence the way information is shared. They were able to go into their site, find his account, ban him and delete his stuff. I say hot take because I believe in freedom of speech. I don’t care if it’s from Trump or whoever else. Everyone has the right to say what they want. Twitter doesn’t have a right to suppress it. If they can stop Trump, what other info are people suppressing from us? ...Like GIVE ME ALL THE INFO!! I don’t care if I agree or disagree with it. Let me see it all and make my own informed decision, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. If Twitter was on a blockchain, Trump’s tweet could never be erased.\n\nBlockchain allows for transparency. One cool feature that comes with blockchain is the ability to be a **“trustless”** network.\n\n![…. But wuttttt, wut do u MEAN TRUSTLESS?! 😩](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8mncDN9dh5Ss_14evMX6K.jpeg?height=1164&width=1280)\n\nI’m not talking trustless like our ex boyfriends… as in lacking trust. Trustless as in *not requiring trust* but... we still know they’re faithful.\n\n![EhEhhhhh](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QNw2rkphlSamBH4ul_-xK.jpeg?height=365&width=650)\n\nSo let’s slow down.\n\nFor example, Fred wants to send Bob $1000. So he goes to his handy dandy Bank of America app, and uses Zelle to try and send his friend $1000. The *bank* is being *TRUSTED* to verify, confirm, and facilitate the sending of $1000 from Fred’s account to Bob’s account. The bank is a central entity that fulfills the “trust role”. When you send your money, you’re 100% sure that the bank isn’t going to rug you and that they verified that Bob and you are legit.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LXfqH7iVF7y6AiBB1yINr.jpeg?height=720&width=1060)\n\nIn a blockchain though, there is no person or entity who verifies the validity of a transaction. Because there is a network of computers who all hold the SAME ledger (transaction list… “public bank statement”), *TRUST* is not needed.. it is trust*LESS*. An **intermediary** is basically rendered obsolete (aheh bye bye bank). The mechanisms behind that which runs blockchains allow for you to transact with someone… without knowing them… with no third party.. and no all mighty ruler reigning above. Just a bro to another bro with 100% faith in the legitimacy of it all still (faithful af).\n\n![Not like him though…](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V_eD5TJGIL-GiZ_VwST1c.jpeg?height=1338&width=2388)\n\nThink about it like this…. You meet up with a friend to give him some cash. You trust your friend will receive your money because well, he’s right in front of your face. Blockchain allows for this type of “peer to peer” transaction but you’re in America and your friend who you’re sending money to, is in Australia... and he’s not even a friend!!! In fact, you don’t even know who he is at all. He’s just some dude who wanted to buy your JPEG. But you’re able to transact with him like you would if you met up in person - with trust and legitimacy.\n\nSince there are multiple copies of the ledger spread out over a network of computers, this means the system has the potential to be decentralized. Meaning not one entity… or big tech company (cough cough) has control over the data. NO ONE CONTROLS THE DATA. This means no more shady business happening behind the scenes that consumers don’t know about. This means full transparency is a GIV 👏 EN 👏. You cannot hide anything on a blockchain. Blockchain technology also means we get to cut out the middlemen and streamline transactions.\n\nNow I say “has the potential to be decentralized” because not all protocols are equal. Some are decentralized with no humans in the mix operating solely from a computer and an algorithm (aka **DEX**- it’s kind of like an “if then” statement where functions only execute when criteria are met). However, some like Binance and Coinbase are centralized, we call these **CEXs** (centralized exchange). They are still using blockchain technology with an immutable ledger. But if they wanted to, they can go in and pull your transaction for you or locate your funds. As they say with CEXs, “*Not your keys, not your coins*”.\n\n![A centralized network is characterized by one entity having more weight over others. It is essentially the government.. controlling and watching over data. It has the ability to manipulate, hide, alter, or pull whatever they see fit (and they don't need to tell you about it)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CYWzVlxNA-tiviivfIB_r.png?height=720&width=1060)\n\n![A decentralized network where all circles are equal wooohooo. No one has weight over anyone else. Data/value is transferred to whoever, whenever, wherever and cannot be hidden or altered. All done with validity and trust too? That's blockchain for u bayyybeeee](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Xqzyt39Us0sVQjCUQW19.png?height=720&width=1060)\n\nRemember that whole ordeal with GME and how Robinhood halted the trading on it that one time.... yeah kind of like that. Like YOU bought GME but it really wasn’t yours because Robinhood told you you couldn’t sell it. ¯\\\\*_(ツ)*_/¯ Same applies for CEXs. You buy the asset.. but then again.. not really LOL.\n\nIf you look at the centralized graphic up above and replaced the “centralized entity” with Robinhood.. Facebook… TikTok… Twitter… then perhaps you might get a better understanding.\n\nBlockchain is the backbone for all of crypto structures. But it has uses outside of cryptocurrency as well. It is so so so so SO SO SO sooooo very important and such a breakthrough technology in my opinion. It has the potential to disrupt so many of our current systems/industries in the best way possible (wink wink\\* there is a reason why there is so much push against it). I wish more people took the time to learn about it instead of just jumping ahead and calling crypto a scam. With the way society is right now... the world.. our leaders... a change is necessary and I truly believe change lies within the adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nThink about our banking industry.. If we utilized blockchain technology, banks would be.. useless. You wouldn’t have to wait to go to the bank Mon-Fri from 8AM-5PM. You wouldn’t need to wait 4 days to wire funds... you wouldn’t be giving your money freely to the banks to lend out to god knows who. Instead, *you* can lend your own money out.. you can BE YOUR OWN BANK. You can borrow, lend, stake, and make your money work for you (this is called **DeFi** AKA decentralized finance) Traditionally, this was something only doable by rich people with cash flow and big connections.\n\nI don’t want to make this too long and hard to digest so that’s it for now. I think I’ll write about some different use cases of blockchain in a later article, so stay tuned for that.\n\nI hope this was a little helpful. I’m not an expert. This is all from my understanding, do take it with a grain of salt and **DYOR** (DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH). If you have any questions... comments.. gripes.. feel free to reach out to me on Twitter ([@theblockchainb](https://twitter.com/theblockchainb))\n\nLUV,\n\nthe bb ❤️\n\n**TERMS TO KNOW**\n\nTrustless\n\nLedger\n\nIntermediary\n\nDEX\n\nCEX\n\nDeFi\n\nDYOR", "timestamp": 1659052871, "digest": "QyobACgfelLMCOunc_cad50t_uJ_z3WhMtSYguJmezk", "contributor": "0x005A75E089206F1C5B788a16A5Dd54CBF6Dd5B9a"}

Newbies receive startup cards that they cannot exchange or trade, using them only on the battlefield.\n\nThe player’s competitive advantage in a battle is determined by their card’s rating. The game’s tokenomics is powered by three tokens: Credits, DEC, and SPS. If your cards leave much to be desired, then buy better ones in the NFT marketplace or spend a couple of bucks on card rental.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*car25aiB2mrU-1OT4jTHBw.png)\n\n## #4 Decentraland\n\n*   Blockchain: Ethereum blockchain\n*   Score: Score *8/10 based on 53 reviews*\n*   Website link: [**Decentraland**](https://coincodecap.com/go/decentraland)\n*   Telegram group: <https://t.me/DecentralandTG>\n\nThose looking for a whole new metaverse to live a second life and earn crypto rewards will definitely enjoy Decentraland. It is a virtual world where you can be a regular player or a business owner, monetizing your digital business. Did you dream of opening a bakery house? No need to do it in reality — you can earn real money by selling bread to digital people in the Decentraland universe.\n\nThe game works on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to experience and create digital content in the virtual land, personalizing their worlds the way they see it. The builders have a huge set of tools to customize their land parcels. The in-game token is MANA, which players use to conduct in-game transactions, buy food and clothing, travel, play P2E games within the metaverse, and do other activities to live an exciting crypto life.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Qo84F0JZMTV-S9SJ_zvNVQ.png)\n\n## #5 The Sandbox\n\n*   Blockchain: Ethereum Blockchain\n*   Score Score *8/10 based on 55 reviews*\n*   Website link: [**Sandbox**](https://coincodecap.com/go/sandbox)\n*   Telegram group: <https://t.me/sandboxgame>\n\nThe Sandbox is a blockchain adaptation of the popular Sandbox game released by Pixowl in 2012. The game provides feature-rich tools to create, sell, and apply VR NFTs in the in-game economy. It allows gamers to monetize their gaming experience in many ways by building their own metaverse reality and projects.\n\nThe Sandbox utilizes the SAND token as its in-game reward to players. SAND is the native currency gamers can use to transact with in-game assets. For example, if you produce unique NFTs and other users see utility in them, they can purchase the NFTs for SAND from you. The in-game production tool is VoxEdit — the 3D voxel modeling and NFT minting software package bringing a set of voxels to life in the form of humans, animals, vehicles, etc. Other ways of earning SAND include in-game campaigns and competitions.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*QQZA02pILZPP4DOrHMWbFg.png)\n\n## #6 Silks\n\n*   Blockchain: Ethereum Blockchain\n*   Score: Score *7/10 based on 35 reviews*\n*   Website link: [**Silks**](https://coincodecap.com/go/silks-io)\n*   Twitter: <https://twitter.com/gameofsilks>\n\nAre you a fan of racing? Even those who have no chance to establish a horse racing or breeding business in real life have received that opportunity in the Silks P2E game. Thousands of players rave about this game because it serves as a genuine bridge between reality and a metaverse of the equestrian business.\n\nBy joining the Silks game, you’re introduced to the world of professional horse racing. You can go through the entire experience of horse breeding and training, breed your own horse with a unique bloodline, and participate in the competition with unique digital horses serving as valuable NFTs. If your horse is good enough, you can earn a fortune on it.\n\nAnd the most exciting thing about Silks is that digital horse NFTs are linked to real-world pedigreed horses. If your horse wins in the real world, its NFT’s owner gets STT tokens as rewards. Players can also organize competitions in the Silks blockchain, trade horses in the NFT marketplace, stake Bitcoins, and earn STT on horse rearing.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*B2FdOqhkcWEcOTP2-Y8ldQ.png)\n\n## #7 Gods Unchained\n\n*   Blockchain: Ethereum Blockchain\n*   Score Score *7/10 based on 42 reviews*\n*   Website link: [**GodsUnchained**](https://coincodecap.com/go/godsunchained)\n*   Telegram channel: <https://t.me/GodsAnnouncements>\n\nGods Unchained is another popular game in the NFT P2E market, operating on the Ethereum blockchain. It has captivating gameplay involving gamers in battles between their god avatars and those of the opponents.

Every card you get is unique, and it gives a unique position in the battle to its owner. Newbies get three free card packs upon joining the game and win stronger cards on the battlefield.\n\nThe game’s cards have 4 rarity types, each having a distinct value. A card’s cost ranges from $0.1 to $50,000 in the NFT marketplace, giving users a chance to raise their status and competitive advantage in the battle for in-game rewards.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*q4GuFyzruSNSoZjfYi-DSA.png)\n\n## #8 Alien Worlds\n\n*   Blockchain: Ethereum, WAX and BNB Chain** (BSC)** blockchains\n*   Score: Score *7/10 based on 31 reviews*\n*   Website link: [**Alien Worlds**](https://coincodecap.com/go/alienworlds)\n*   Telegram channel: <https://t.me/AlienWorldsOffical>\n\nFans of space themes in gaming will be happy to join the Aliens Worlds community.

It was produced by a Vietnamese company Sly Mavis and released in 2018. Ethereum and Ronin blockchains power the game and create a fun, exciting gaming experience for users raising their Pokemon-like Axies to win rewards for their owners.\n\nThe P2E mechanics of the game is simple: users need to earn SLPs (Smooth Love Potions) and AXS (Axie Infinity Shards), which possess monetary value and can be traded for ETH or other currencies. To earn these rewards, players should maintain their regular activity in the game, log in every day, complete the assigned challenges, and win PvP battles. Axie breeding is also lucrative, as a capable and skilled Axie can be traded for a fair sum of money in the NFT marketplace.\n\n## #12 Parallel\n\n*   Blockchain: Binance Smart Chain\n*   Score: Score *6/10 based on 28 reviews*\n*   Website link: [**Parallel**](https://coincodecap.com/go/theparallel)\n*   Twitter: <https://twitter.com/theparallel_com>\n\nImagine the distant future world, a post-apocalyptic landscape, and a massive exodus of humans from the Earth. Parallel is one of the games that are still in the process of fine-tuning. Yet, interested P2E fans can already try it out and test its core features.\n\nThis Ethereum-based P2E product went through the alpha sale round in March 2021, raising $1.3 million for its further development. The card drop round occurred in August 2021, yielding an additional $1.3 million from card sales.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*qIpMwYJPtY7wNb_c-MNC5Q.png)\n\n**Why is Parallel so popular?**\n\nIt’s all about the team and the concept art behind it. It’s well-known that the P2E market is still lagging far behind the mainstream gaming market in terms of graphics and animation. A beautifully designed artistic concept is a rare gem in the P2E industry. So, you’ll be thrilled to know that artists who worked on the visual concepts of Blizzard, EA, and Ubisoft are behind the Parallel concept art.\n\nParallel’s cards are performed in the best sci-fi tradition, reminiscent of Interstellar images. Besides, the game offers an unusual tokenomic model, relying on the NFTs alone, without using tokens.\n\n## #13 My Neighbor Alice\n\n*   Blockchain: Ethereum Blockchain\n*   Score: Score *6/10 based on 27 reviews*\n*   Website link: [**My Neighbor Alice**](https://coincodecap.com/go/myneighboralice)\n*   Telegram channel: <https://t.me/MyNeighborAlice>\n\nThis game is a relatively new offering in the NFT P2E game market. It was released in January 2022 but quickly gained popularity among the masses. Its fun, appealing graphics, and a metaverse idea attract thousands of avid gamers wishing to build their new virtual homes and earn crypto assets.\n\nMy Neighbor Alice’s popularity is partly explained by the fact that it welcomes even NFT rookies. It means that even if the crypto world, blockchain, and NFT terms mean nothing to you, you can still play and succeed. All you need is to buy some land and start engaging in farming, fishing, and beekeeping to collect rewards in the in-game token ALICE. Those who collect enough ALICE can stake it to earn passive income.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*sBAhlvmBKhsdPW1hnverfQ.png)\n\n## #14 RaceFi\n\n*   Blockchain: Solana Blockchain\n*   Score: Score *6/10 based on 26 reviews*\n*   Website link: [**RaceFi**](https://coincodecap.com/go/racefi)\n*   Telegram channel: <https://t.me/racefi_io>\n\nCar racing has been an unpopular theme in P2E gaming thus far. But things are changing, and RaceFi is a good example that even car competitions can be adapted for exciting P2E gameplay. This game operates on a Solana ecosystem and is a one-of-a-kind game with AI/ML features.\n\nThe game’s graphics are breathtaking, meeting the high standard of traditional car racing animation. The in-game P2E opportunities are also diverse; gamers can win crypto tokens by competing with other players on the racetracks, own garages and gas stations, and even buy land within the game for further rental.

It has already collected over 130,000 active players on the waitlist, meaning its release will be hype.\n\nThe in-game transactions can be done with the help of the GOG token. The storyline is a mystery to a large degree; all we know is that players will be invited to create guilds of fantasy guardians and compete for epic rewards in the game’s virtual world.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*7aSXnaBBxbQjh01FbxNB6w.png)\n\n## Is P2E Gaming Better than Traditional Gaming?\n\nAs you can see, the NFT P2E market is rising quickly, with thousands of new players joining the community. The outbreak of COVID-19 and related social restrictions also contributed to the spread of P2E gaming, with millions of people locked in their homes and limited in their work opportunities. However, this gaming sector is yet to become mainstream; traditional mobile and desktop gaming still rule this #1 entertainment industry globally. With the gaming market expected to double from $200 billion to $400+ billion by 2030, P2E games are sure to contribute to that growth to a large degree.

Graham-and-Doddsville）的演讲，这也是巴菲特最精彩、最广为人知的演讲之一。\n>\n> 在演讲中，巴菲特用他一贯风趣生动的语言，令人信服的展示了成功的股市投资者绝不是“黑猩猩蒙着眼睛抛硬币”的侥幸获胜者，因为他们年复一年的战胜市场。这无法用偶然性来解释，而这些成功者也并非服从随机分布，他们都出自于巴菲特所说的“格雷厄姆-多德部落”，也就是终身信奉价值投资哲学的人。\n>\n> 价值投资是否已经过时？当我们有疑问的时候，可以拿出这篇演讲来读一读。\n\n## 开场白\n\n格雷厄姆和多德“寻找价值相对于价格具有显著的安全边际”的证券分析方法难道已经过时了吗？许多教授在他们编写的大部头教科书中都作出这一论断。他们口口声声地宣称股票市场是有效的，也就是说股价反映了所有关于公司发展前景和经济状况的所有信息。这些理论家们声称，由于聪明的股票分析师利用了所有可获取的信息进行分析判断，从而使股价总是正确无误地保持在合理的水平，因此根本不存在价值被市场低估的股票。至于那些年复一年击败市场的投资者，只不过是类似彩票连续中奖的少数幸运儿。一位教授在他编写的当今十分流行的教科书中写道：“如果股价完全反映了所有可获取的信息，这些投资技巧将毫无用处。”\n\n哈哈，也许如此。但我想向大家介绍一群年复一年击败标准普尔500股票指数的投资者。他们的经历无可辩驳地表明，那种认为他们持续战胜市场只是偶然事件的简单看法，是很难成立的，我们必须深入探究其根本原因。之所以如此，一个关键事实是，这些股市大赢家我都非常熟悉，并且很早就被公认为超级投资者，其中成名最晚的那位也在15年前就名扬一时了。如果事实并非如此，我只是最近搜索了成千上万的投资记录，从中选出几个业绩优秀的人在此向各位介绍，那么，你听到此处就可以把我赶走了。\n\n我要补充说明的是，他们的投资业绩记录都已经经过严格的审计。另外，我还要补充说明一下，我还认识许多选择这些投资管理人的客户，他们这些年来获得的投资收益与这些投资管理人公开的投资业绩记录完全相符。\n\n## 一、全美抛硬币猜正反面大赛\n\n在我们开始探究这些投资大师为什么能够持续战胜市场之谜前，我想先请在座的各位跟我一起来观赏一场想象中的全美抛硬币猜正反面大赛。\n\n假设我们动员全美国2.25亿人明天早上每人赌1美元，猜一下抛出的一个硬币落到地上是正面还是反面，赢家可以从输家手中赢得1美元。每一天输家被淘汰出局，赢家则把所赢得的钱全部投入，作为第二天的赌注。经过十个早上的比赛，将大约有22万名美国人连续获胜，他们每人可赢得略微超过1,000美元的钱。\n\n人类的虚荣本性会使这群赢家们开始有些洋洋得意。尽管他们想尽量表现得十分谦虚，但在鸡尾酒会上，为了吸引异性的好感，他们会吹嘘自己在抛硬币上如何技术高超，如何天才过人。\n\n如果赢家从输家手里得到相应的赌注，再过十天，将会有215位连续猜对20次硬币的正反面的赢家。通过这一系列较量，他们每个人用1美元赢得了100万美元之多。215个赢家赢得225个百万美元，这也意味着其他输家输掉了225个百万美元。\n\n这群刚刚成为百万富翁的大赢家们肯定会高兴到发昏，他们很可能会写一本书—“我如何每天只需工作30秒，就在20天里用1美元赚到100万美元”。更有甚者，他们可能会在全国飞来飞去，参加各种抛硬币神奇技巧的研讨会，借机来嘲笑那些满脸疑问的大学教授们：“如果这种事根本不可能发生，难道我们这215个大赢家是从天下掉下来的吗？”\n\n对此，一些工商管理学院的教授可能会恼羞成怒，他们不屑一顾地指出：“即使是2.25亿只大猩猩参加同样的抛硬币比赛，结果毫无二致”。\n\n但我对此却不敢苟同，在我下面所说的案例中，这些赢家们确实有一些明显的与众不同之处。我所说的案例如下：\n\n（1）参加比赛的2.25亿只猩猩大致像美国人口一样分布在全国各地;\n\n（2）经过20天比赛后，只剩下215位赢家；\n\n（3）如果你发现其中40家赢家全部来自奥马哈的一家十分独特的动物园。\n\n那么，你肯定会前往这家动物园找饲养员问个究竟：他们给猩猩喂的是什么食物？他们是否对这些猩猩进行过特殊的训练？这些猩猩在读些什么书？还有其他种种你认为可能的原因。换句话说，如果那些成功的赢家不同寻常地集中，你就会想弄明白到底是什么不同寻常的因素导致了这些赢家不同寻常地集中。\n\n## 二、格雷厄姆和多德价值投资部落\n\n当然，我和各位一样认为，事实上，除了地理因素之外，还有很多其他因素会导致赢家非常地集中。除了地理因素以外，还有一种因素，我称之为智力因素。我想你会发现，在投资界为数众多的大赢家们却不成比例地全部来自于一个小小的智力部落——格雷厄姆和多德部落，这种现象根本无法用偶然性或随机性来解释，最终只能归因于这个与众不同的智力部落。\n\n我想要研究的这一群成功投资者，他们拥有一位共同的智力部落酋长—本·格雷厄姆。但是这些孩子长大后，都离开了这个智力家族，他们却是根据非常不同的方法来进行投资的。他们居住在不同的地区，买卖不同的股票和企业，但他们总体的投资业绩绝非是因为他们根据酋长的指示作出了完全相同的投资决策，酋长只为他们提供了决策的思想理论，每位学生都以自己的独特方式来决定如何运用这种理论。\n\n来自“格雷厄姆与多德部落”的投资者共同拥有的智力核心是：寻找企业整体的价值与代表该企业一小部分权益的股票市场价格之间的差异。实质上，他们利用了二者之间的差异，却毫不在意有效市场理论家们所关心的那些问题——股票应该在星期一还是星期二买进，在1月份还是7月份买进，等等。追随格雷厄姆与多德的投资者根本不会浪费精力去讨论什么B贝塔值、资本资产定价模型、不同证券投资报酬率之间的协方差，他们对这些东西丝毫也不感兴趣。事实上，他们中的大多数人甚至连这些名词的定义都搞不清楚，追随格雷厄姆与多德的投资人只关心两个变量——价值与价格。\n\n我总是惊奇地发现，如此众多的学术研究与技术分析臭味相投，他们关注的都是股票价格和数量行为。你能想象，整体收购一家企业只是因为其价格在前两周明显上涨了吗？\n\n当然，关于价格与数量因素研究泛滥成灾的原因在于：电脑的普及与应用。电脑制造出了无穷无尽的关于股价和成交数量的数据。这些研究毫无必要，因为它们毫无用途。这些研究的出现只是因为有大量的现成数据，而且学者们辛辛苦苦学会了玩弄数据的高深数学技巧。一旦人们掌握了那些技巧，不运用就会产生一种负罪感，即使这些技巧的运用根本没有任何作用，甚至还会有负作用。正如一位朋友所言，“对于一个拿着斧子的人来说，什么东西看起来都像一颗钉子”。\n\n## 三、九位格雷厄姆和多德部落的超级投资者\n\n我认为，这群来自同一个智力家族的投资者们十分值得进一步研究。顺便说一下，尽管所有的学术研究都关注类似于价格、数量、周期性、市值规模等因素对股价表现的影响，却从来没有证据表明学术界有兴趣研究这群非同寻常集中的价值导向的大赢家们所采用的投资策略。\n\n关于投资业绩记录的研究，我首先要从1954-1956年间我们在格雷厄姆—纽曼公司（Graham-Newman Corporation）工作的四位同伴开始。我们总共只有四个人，我并不是从数以千计的投资人中挑选出这四个人的。我选修格雷厄姆的投资课程之后，要求进入这家公司无偿工作，但格雷厄姆却以我要价太高为由拒绝了我的要求，他对价值因素考虑得非常严肃和认真。在我一再恳求之下，他最后终于答应雇用我。当时公司有三位合伙人，还有我们四位当时对投资还不太在行的“小学徒”（the“peasant”level）。从1955-1957年公司结束，我们四个人先后离开了公司。目前，我们能够追踪到其中三个人的投资记录。\n\n### 1、沃尔特·施洛斯\n\n这是沃尔特·施洛斯（Walter Schloss）的投资记录。沃尔特没有上过大学，但他在纽约金融学院（the New York Institute of Finance）选修了格雷厄姆教授的夜间课程。沃尔特1955年离开了格雷厄姆-纽曼公司，在其后28年中，他取得了以上投资业绩记录。\n\n亚当·史密斯（Adam Smith）经我介绍采访了沃尔特，他在他的著作《超级金钱》（Supermoney，1972）中对沃特是这样描述的：“他根本不与外界进行沟通，也没有任何获取有用信息的渠道。事实上，华尔街上根本没有人认识他，他也根本不理会华尔街上的任何想法。他只是仔细查看股票手册上的有关数据，向公司索取年报，他所做的一切仅此而已。”\n\n沃尔特的投资组合是多元化的，他通常持有100多只股票。他知道如何发掘那些股票市值明显低于公司私有化价值的股票。这就是他要做的一切。\n\n他根本不考虑交易时间是不是1月份、是不是在周一、是不是选举之年。他只是这样想，如果一个企业价值1美元，而我能够用40美分买入，我很可能会取得很好的投资回报。他一次又一次地寻找这样的投资机会。他拥有的股票数目比我多得多——而且他和我不同的是，他对公司业务的基本特点几乎都不感兴趣。我对沃尔特来说根本没有什么影响力，这正是他非常强大的个人品质之一：没有人能够影响他。\n\n### 2、汤姆·科拿普\n\n第二个案例是汤姆·科拿普（Tom Knapp），他也是我在格雷厄姆-纽曼公司的同事。二战前，他是普林斯顿大学化学专业的学生。二战结束后，他退伍回来后终日在海滩上游荡。有一天，当他得知大卫·多德将在哥伦比亚大学开设夜间投资课程，汤姆以无学分方式选修了这门课程。他很快对投资产生了浓厚的兴趣，以至于正式注册进入哥伦比亚商学院学习，后来他获得了MBA学位。35年后，我打电话给汤姆核实我以上所说的事情，这时他仍然在海滩上游荡，唯一的不同是，他现在拥有了整片海滩！\n\n1986年，汤姆·科拿普与同样是格雷厄姆信徒的艾德·安德森（Ed Anderson）以及其他几位有共同投资理念的人合伙组建了特维帝-布朗合伙公司（Tweedy, Browne Partners），他们的投资业绩见表2。\n\n### 3、沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）\n\n格雷厄姆-纽曼公司第三位员工的投资业绩记录。他在1957年成立巴菲特合伙公司，他所作出的最明智的决策就是在1969年结束合伙公司。从某种意义上讲，从此以后，伯克希尔哈撒韦公司在某种程度上成为合伙公司的延续。我无法给各位一个能够公正衡量伯克夏公司投资管理水平的单一业绩指标，但我认为，不论采用任何衡量指标，你都会发现伯克希尔的投资业绩一直都令人相当满意。\n\n### 4.红杉基金\n\n红杉基金（the Sequoia Fund）的投资业绩记录。该基金经理是比尔·鲁安（Bill Ruane），1951年我们在格雷厄姆的课程中结识。他从哈佛商学院毕业后，进入华尔街工作。他在工作中意识到自己需要接受一种真正的商业教育，于是报名参加了格雷厄姆在哥伦比亚大学的投资课程，1951年年初我们正是在那里相识的。\n\n从1951-1970年间，比尔所管理的资金规模相对于平均水平而言小得多，但投资业绩却远远超过平均水平。当我结束巴菲特合伙公司时，我问鲁安能否成立一家基金公司，以吸收巴菲特合伙公司原来合伙人的资金，于是他就设立了红杉基金。他设立这只基金的时候，恰恰在我结束合伙公司之时，这是一个非常糟糕的市场时机。他正好碰上了一个双重市场，并且遭遇了价值投资者相对业绩表现非常差劲的困难时期。我非常高兴地说，我原来的合伙人不但继续与他相守，而且追加了更多的资金，他取得如此优秀的投资业绩，当然让基金持有人非常满意。\n\n我并非事后诸葛亮。比尔是我当时推荐给合伙人的唯一人选。当时我就表示，如果他能取得高出标准普尔指数4个百分点的投资业绩，就非常不错了。但尽管所管理的资金规模不断扩大，比尔的投资业绩却远胜于此。资金规模越大，投资管理越困难，资金规模是投资业绩增长的绊脚石。虽然这并不意味着资金规模的扩大会使你的投资业绩无法超过平均水平，但超越平均水平的幅度会有所减小。如果你所管理的资金规模高达2万亿美元，这正好相当于整个股票市场的总市值，那么，你根本不可能取得超过平均水平的投资业绩。\n\n### 5、查理·芒格\n\n表5的投资业绩记录来自于我的一位朋友--查理·芒格（Charles Munger）。他毕业于哈佛大学法学院，并且成立了一家律师事务所。我是在1960年前后认识他的，当时我对他说，律师作为一种业余爱好相当不错，但是他完全可以在投资中做得更好。于是，他成立了一家投资合伙人公司。\n\n他的投资风格与沃尔特·施洛斯完全相反，他的投资组合集中于非常少数的证券，因此投资业绩的波动性很大，但他遵循的同样是寻找价值被低估股票的投资策略。他愿意接受投资业绩从高峰到低谷的大幅震荡，正如结果所表明的那样，他正好是那种心理能力完全适合集中投资的人。不用多说，这正是我在伯克希尔公司的长期合作伙伴查理芒格的投资业绩记录。不过，当他管理他自己的合伙公司时，他的投资组合与我以及前面提到的投资人完全不同。\n\n### 6、李克·古瑞恩\n\n投资业绩记录属于查理的一位好朋友、同样并非商学院毕业。他毕业于南加州大学数学系，毕业后进入IBM，曾经做过一段时间的销售工作。在我认识查理之后不久，查理也认识了他。他就是这份投资业绩记录的创造者李克·古瑞恩（Rick Guerin）。从1965-1983年，标准普尔指数的投资回报为316%，而李克·古瑞恩的投资业绩为22200%，或许是由于没有商学院教育的背景，他竟然认为这在统计上具有显著意义。\n\n这里我们偏离一下主题，让我感到非常奇怪的是，对于以40美分的价格买进1美元纸币这种价值投资理念，人们要么是马上就接受，要么就是根本不接受。这种投资理念如此简单，可是他们就是无法领悟。像李克这样完全没有接受过正式商业教育的人，马上就领悟了价值投资的策略，并且在五分钟之后就开始学以致用。我从来没有见过一个人是在10年之内才逐渐地皈依价值投资理念的，这似乎和智商或学术教育无关，要么顿悟，要么永远无法领悟。\n\n### 7、斯坦·波尔米塔\n\n这是斯坦·波尔米塔（Stan Perlmeter）的投资业绩记录。他毕业于密西根大学艺术系，是波泽尔雅各布斯（Bozell&Jacobs）广告公司的合伙人之一。我和他的办公室恰好位于奥马哈市的同一栋大楼。1965年，他发现我所从事的投资业比他从事的广告业前景更好，于是他离开了广告业。与李克·古瑞恩一样，斯坦·波尔米塔在五分钟之内就完全接受了价值投资理念。\n\n斯坦·波尔米塔所持有的股票与沃尔特·施洛斯不同，也与比尔持有的股票不同，他们的投资记录表明，他们各自独立进行不同的股票投资。但斯坦·波尔米塔每一次买进股票都是由于他确信将来卖出所获得的回报会高于他所支付的买入价格，这是他唯一考虑的因素。他既不关心公司季度盈利预测是多少，也不关心公司明年收益预测如何，他只关注一个问题：这个公司的价值是多少？\n\n### 8、华盛顿邮报公司退休基金\n\n下面的投资业绩记录分别属于我参与的两家退休基金，它们并非是从我所参与的十几种退休基金中选择出来的，他是唯一两家我能够影响其投资决策的退休基金。在这两家基金中，我引导他们转变为价值导向的投资管理人，只有非常少数的基金是基于价值进行投资管理的。\n\n表8是华盛顿邮报公司退休基金（the Washington Post Company's Pension Fund）的投资业绩记录。几年之前，他们委托一家大型银行管理基金，后来我建议他们聘请以价值为导向的基金经理，这样能够使投资业绩更好。\n\n正如你在投资记录中所看到的那样，自从他们更换基金经理之后，整体投资业绩在所有基金中一直名列前茅。华盛顿邮报公司要求基金经理人至少保持25%的资金投资于债券，而债券未必是基金经理人的投资选择。因此，我在表中也将其债券投资业绩包括在内，而这些数据表明：他们其实并没有什么特别的债券专业技巧，他们也从未这样吹嘘过自己。虽然有25%的资金投资于他们所不擅长的债券领域，从而拖累了他们的投资业绩，但其基金管理业绩水平仍然名列前一百名之内。\n\n### 9、FMC公司退休基金\n\n这份投资业绩属于FMC公司退休基金，我本人没有管理过这家基金的一分钱，但我的确在1974年影响了他们的决策，说服他们选择以价值为导向的基金经理。在此之前，他们采取与其他大型公司相同的方式来选择基金经理。在他们转向价值投资策略之后，其投资业绩目前在贝克退休基金调查报告（the Becker survey of pension funds）中超越其他同等规模基金而名列第一。\n\n1983年时，该基金共有8位任职1年以上的基金经理，其中7位累积投资业绩超过标准普尔指数。在此期间，FMC基金的实际业绩表现与基金平均业绩表现的净回报差额是2.43亿美元，FMC将此归功于他们与众不同的基金经理选择倾向，这些基金经理未必会是我个人中意的选择，但他们都具有一个共同的特点，即基于价值来选择股票。\n\n以上这9项投资业绩记录都来自于格雷厄姆与多德部落的投资大赢家。我并非像事后诸葛亮那样，以后见之明而从数千名投资者中挑选出这9个大赢家，也不是在朗读一群在中奖之前我根本不认识的彩票中奖者的名单。\n\n多年之前，我就根据投资决策的架构选择出他们进行研究，我知道他们接受过什么样的投资教育，在接触中也多少了解他们的智力、品质和性格。非常重要的是，我们必须要知道，这群人往往被大家想当然地认为只承受了远低于平均水平的风险，请注意他们在股市疲弱年份的投资业绩记录。尽管他们的投资风格不同，但其投资态度却完全相同——购买的是企业而非股票。他们当中有些人有时会整体收购企业，但是他们更多的只是购买企业的一小部分权益。不论购买企业的整体还是购买企业的一小部分权益，他们所持的态度都是完全相同的。他们中的有些人的投资组合中有几十种股票，有些人则集中于少数几只股票，但是每个人的投资业绩都来自于利用股票价格与公司内在价值之间的差异。\n\n## 四、价值投资风险更小，却收益更高\n\n我确信在股票市场中存在着许多无效的现象，这些“格雷厄姆与多德部落”的投资人之所以成功，就在于他们利用了市场无效性所产生的价格与价值之间的差异。在华尔街上，股价会受到羊群效应的巨大影响，当最情绪化、最贪婪的或最沮丧的人决定股价的高低时，所谓市场价格是理性的说法很难令人信服。事实上，市场价格经常是荒谬愚蠢的。\n\n在价值投资中却恰恰相反。如果你以60美分买进1美元的纸币，其风险大于以40美分买进1美元的纸币，可是后者的预期报酬却更高。基于价值构造的投资组合，风险更小，预期报酬却高得多。\n\n我举一个简单的例子：1973年，华盛顿邮报公司总市值为8,000万美元，那时任何一天你都可以将其资产卖给十位买家中的任何一位，而且价格不会低于4亿美元，甚至还会更高。该公司拥有《华盛顿邮报》、《新闻周刊》以及几家市场地位举足轻重的电视台，这些资产目前的市场价值高达20亿美元。因此，愿意支付4亿美元的买家并非疯狂之举。\n\n现在股价如果继续下跌，公司市值从8,000万美元跌到4,000万美元，其Beta值也会相应地上升。对于用Beta值衡量风险的人来说，价格跌得越低，意味着风险变得越大。这真是爱莉丝仙境一般的人间神话，我永远无法了解为什么用4,000万美元会比用8,000万美元购买价值4亿美元的风险更高。事实上，如果你能够买进好几只价值被严重低估的股票，而且精通公司估值，那么，以8,000万美元买入价值4亿美元的资产，特别是分别以800万美元的价格，买进10种价值4,000万美元的资产，基本上是毫无风险的。因为你本人无法亲自管理4亿美元的资产，所以，你希望并确信能够找到诚实并且能干的管理者共同来管理公司，这并非一件困难之事。\n\n## 五、价值投资将继续长期战胜市场\n\n你们当中的也许是那些商业头脑比较发达的人会怀疑我这番高谈阔论的动机何在，让更多的人转向价值投资必然会使价格与价值的差距更小，这不是会让我自己的投资获得的机会更少吗？\n\n我只能告诉你，早在50年前本·格雷厄姆与多德写出《证券分析》一书时，价值投资策略就公之于众了。我实践价值投资长达35年，却从没有发现有任何大众转向价值投资的趋势，似乎人类有某种把本来简单的事情变得更加复杂的顽固本性。\n\n船舶将永远环绕地球航行，但相信地球是平的人仍旧很多。在股票市场中，价格与价值之间仍将继续保持着很大的差距，那些信奉格雷厄姆与多德价值投资策略的投资人仍将继续取得巨大的成功。\n\n>

David Hoffman calls this “The New Supreme Court”:\n\n“The legal courts overseeing the Celsius and 3AC cases are subordinate to the court of the EVM; the code that enforces the smart contracts that power the DeFi lending applications. The EVM is the most superior court in the world. The legal contract system of nation-state courts is junior to Ethereum and the EVM.\n\nWhen markets break down, they revert back to a system of lawyers and courts, and we are currently witnessing that in the cases of 3AC and Celcius. Long-drawn-out court proceedings are beginning; meanwhile, DeFi is still chugging away and onto the next thing. And no DeFi lenders lost a dime.”\n\nCrypto banks, though, are opaque and prone to risky leveraging calls. In this case, that risk bubbled into a public health epidemic of sorts.\n\nA thousand page legal document revealed this week that Three Arrows Capital owed 27 crypto companies a total of $3.5B, of which the largest chunk belongs to crypto lender Genesis that made an undercollaterized loan of $2.36B.

{"id": "VrbpJUrFDz9MPNWdPdAA_IESuBkXfvqJc2pc3fjIM0w", "title": "PUSHing Web3 Forward: What is EPNS and why should you care?", "body": "Hey friends 👋\n\nIf you’ve read much of my content, you’ll know that I love to dig deep and look at the inner workings of various technologies 🔬  After all, a lot of very deliberate choices have to be made for things to work in a way that feels seamless.\n\nTake for example the push notifications you receive all day long on your phone. They can be a bit overwhelming at times, but have you ever thought about what it would be like if they just didn’t exist at all? Let’s really consider this for a moment 🧐\n\nImagine having to refresh your text messages constantly to see if you’d received a response you were awaiting. Or if your phone never told you the battery was getting low, but just suddenly died 😰  Time sensitive alerts like reminders or multi-factor authentication would all be far less useful than they are today, if they even worked at all.\n\nYou see, push notifications are really just a frontend UX for *push technology*, one of the foundational pieces of the internet as we know it, where rather than a user having to initiate a *pull request* for content, that transaction is issued by the publisher or central server instead ✨\n\nLet’s look at this through an entirely analog example: A push message is like having the newspaper delivered to your door every day, whereas a pull request is like you having to go to the newsstand yourself every day to get the paper 🗞  If what you want is the news delivered in a timely manner, push seems the more compelling option.\n\nThe *push notification*, which **[originated on Blackberry](https://thenextweb.com/news/evolution-of-phones-notifications)** but was brought to the mainstream by Apple with their Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) on iOS3, is the little message that is sent to the user interface (smartphone screen) to elicit a response from the user 🔔\n\nPutting aside any critiques of the ways push notifications can be used to manipulate users into over-using social media or their devices in general, this is undoubtedly one of the most important pieces of modern computing infrastructure, and one of the factors that helped drive mainstream adoption.\n\nDespite this fact, we hardly give much thought to this humble technology. That is, until it’s not there 🔍\n\nYou see the way push notifications work on smartphones (or web browsers) is that the push message is sent from one centralized server to another centralized server and then translated to a notification which is then pushed to the user (you).\n\nThis can work well enough, but it suffers from a particular fault: centralization. If you remove either the app developers central database or Apple/Google from the stack, there’s no longer an easy way to receive a notification. And since Web3 is predicated on removing these middlemen, we need a solution 👀\n\nEnter EPNS.\n\n## What is EPNS?\n\nThe **[Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)](https://epns.io/)** is a decentralized push system that allows wallets to subscribe directly to notification channels. As I alluded to above, Web3 is built to be permissionless and non-custodial and thus, by design, user data is not stored on centralized servers or linked to email accounts. This is great for user privacy, security, and censorship resistance, but it effectively removes the endpoints needed for traditional push notifications 🔌\n\nUntil now.\n\nWhat EPNS does is introduce a novel system of decentralized middleware. *A communications layer for Web3* 😲  Users can subscribe to channels for communication which opens the doors to a whole range of use cases from minor insights to critical alerts 🚨\n\nHere are some examples of uses that help illuminate the value being created here:\n\n* Nearing liquidation warning (lending and borrowing)\n* Staking rewards available to claim (staking)\n* Price alerts (trading)\n* Stablecoin peg slippage (arbitrage)\n* Low gas alert\n* Governance Updates\n* Airdrops\n\nThese are just some of the potential opportunities unlocked by EPNS. But like all technologies, it’s hard to even imagine the things that power users will eventually create in the future 🔮\n\nSpeaking of technology…\n\n## How does it work?\n\nEPNS is a decentralized protocol that allows dApps and other sources to create channels to which users can subscribe. Once a user is subscribed to a channel, they will receive push notifications which can come in the form of *broadcasts* sent out to all subscribers, messages to subsets of subscribers, or even targeted messages to an individual wallet address. 📬\n\n## Sending\n\nBy staking a small amount of PUSH tokens (formerly DAI), users can create a channel, which allows for the sending of messages.\n\n> *Businesses, dapps, and even individuals can all be channels; they can program notifications to be sent in response to on-chain information, and/or send notifications manually for off-chain activities*\n\nSource: **[EPNS Blog](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/getting-started-with-epns-ca2dd7f43329)**\n\nMessage data can be sent via the EPNS Communicator contract which can be deployed on any EVM compatible blockchain, and eventually even non-EVM compatible chains. This data is picked up by the Push Nodes which are always listening to the Communicator contracts 🦻  The Push Nodes connect to the EPNS Core smart contract for validation (basically confirming that the sender is an existing channel and is not spamming) and then they dispatch those messages to the front-end infrastructure 📲  EPNS provides apps for iOS, Android, and Web that can read and display these notifications to users, but in the future, this will be integrated into your wallet of choice.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*op8Az6jrBGBnftwWWKT78w.png)\n\n## Receiving\n\nAs I mentioned above, subscribers are users who have opted in to receive notifications from a specific channel. That’s a very straightforward process. Just open the **[EPNS app](https://app.epns.io/)** and connect your wallet. From the *channels* tab, you can easily subscribe to your preferred channels, whether you want to be notified of liquidation risk on Compound or Aave, receive updates about governance on the projects you follow, or simply get notifications about the current Ethereum gas price ⛽️  And even more services are coming as more and more protocols decide to implement EPNS notifications.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*fKBAJD4kGhsQXNZ-qY4qTA.png)\n\nFrom the app, you can also check your inbox to see all the messages you’ve received and opt out of channels you no longer want to follow.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThere’s a lot of upgrades coming to the protocol that will add greater functionality and further increase decentralization. For example, one of the most exciting features in the **[2022 roadmap](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2022-2698ab153c1a)** is wallet to wallet communication. This will open up new opportunities like decentralized chat apps and will pave the way for something much bigger: smart contract to smart contract communication. That is something that is particularly exciting, as it could allow for incredible automation opportunities 🤖\n\nImagine for example that when your loan is at risk of liquidation, Aave could just send a push notification to a smart contract that you’d filled with additional collateral, triggering a top up and avoiding liquidation without you having to lift a finger. This sort of approach is hypothetically possible using these technologies. And that’s really just the tip of the iceberg 🧊\n\n## Node Decentralization\n\nAn important next step in EPNS’ progressive decentralization of the protocol is to decentralize nodes. This is going to be done through a system of permissionless participation based on game theory. The nodes themselves don’t require any hardware as they are essentially software server nodes that store relevant data on IPFS. The key feature is a focus on incentivizing participation with staking rewards and penalizing bad behaviour via slashing 🤺\n\nThe EPNS Core and Comm(unicator) smart contracts have been **[audited by ChainSafe](https://ethereum-push-notification.gitbook.io/epns-smart-contracts/security-audits)**, so the next step is to ensure that push nodes are ready to support all the new features, especially the multi-chain support, and then to decentralize further from there 🌐\n\n## Governance\n\nEPNS is governed by PUSH token holders and in keeping with the push (no pun intended) towards progressive decentralization, EPNS is working hard to get the tokens into the hands of active contributors and stewards of the protocol. This is intended to be accomplished through the newly launched grants program (of which I was a recipient), the weekly Rockstar of EPNS awards for participation (with winners selected by Snapshot vote), and meta-governance through DAO to DAO partnerships. Other tools for rewarding active community members, like **[Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/)** are being discussed as well 💬\n\nIf you’re reading this and think EPNS sounds interesting, I encourage you to **[join the discord](https://discord.gg/NT3scMBZUy)**, ask questions and get involved in whatever way you can. Also check out the **[website](https://epns.io/)**, **[blog](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service)**, and **[twitter](https://twitter.com/epnsproject)**.\n\nThe future of the web is being built as we speak and, like everything that came before it, it’s the underlying technologies that have the biggest impact. I started this post by discussing push notifications, those ubiquitous pop-ups that we probably never think about unless they’re either driving us mad or saving our hides. But ask any app developer, this is an absolutely crucial piece of the user experience and it’s been missing from Web3.\n\nUntil now 🔔\n\n\n---\n\nThis post is brought to you thanks to a grant from EPNS’ Push Grants program 🤝  As always the opinions expressed are my own, I do not work with projects I don’t believe in, and I implore you to do your own research before investing.\n\nTo learn more about the Ethereum Push Notification Service, visit **[epns.io](https://epns.io/)**\n\n\n---\n\n![Handshake designed by OpenMoji – the open-source emoji and icon project.

{"id": "xv0ZQr_SpjI5TTYA1mc6JXaltbfP3YlrBEvp42F-2_8", "title": "Greetings from Optimism: PoolTogether Makes the Jump to Layer 2", "body": "Hey friends 👋\n\nIn spite of all the chaos in the world, I still fancy myself an optimist. I love how the combination of human coordination and technology can seemingly solve almost any problem 🤝\n\nTake for example the issues the Ethereum network has faced in recent years. As a robust and secure smart contract blockchain, it has become the dominant platform for settlements, decentralized finance, and NFTs. But Ethereum’s base layer is built to put security above all else and, as such, opts for relatively small blocks 🧱\n\nSmall blocks help maintain decentralization because the nodes that store history don’t need to add massive data dumps several times per minute. This means average people, with reasonably average computers can run them. The trade-off however is, understandably, throughput.\n\nA common visualization of this problem is that of a highway. As traffic increases, more cars (usually containing very few passengers) begin to use the road. Soon, it’s congested 🚗🚙🚗\n\nA lot of people make the assumption that simply adding more lanes will solve the problem, but more lanes use more land, and ultimately, those lanes too fill up. Eventually you have to add more and more lanes (aka bigger and bigger blocks) until the land required is no longer feasible… then what? 🧐\n\nWe don’t see many 24 lane highways being constructed because there is a far better solution available, and it’s one that can actually solve the issue and scale without consuming the entirety of our landscape (or in the case of blockchains, our hard-drive space)…\n\n## Mass Transit\n\n![Timelapse of Busses in Panama City by Luis Quintero](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UfOKixfaQWdT3dtwEes1xw.jpeg)\n\nI know what you’re thinking: “what is this? Infrastructure Week?” 🤨\n\nMy friend, when it comes to designing systems, every week is infrastructure week.\n\nSo let’s go back to the analogy of highways. Let’s say that on a hypothetical strip of road, each lane can hold 100 cars, and let’s say that we have 3 lanes. Well then, we have 300 cars cruising along. But as this route becomes more popular, many more cars come, and congestion causes unbearable slowdowns, or worse, accidents 😓\n\nWe could double the lanes, yes. But then we’re only good until we hit 600 cars. Imagine if we instead put more people in each vehicle 🚌 A city transit bus can hold on average 60+ passengers in about the space of two or three cars.\n\nIf each two cars in our hypothetical scenario above was replaced with a bus containing even half of its capacity, we’d have 150 busses of 30 people each. That’s 4500 people in the same space as about 300 (most cars travel with a single passenger, but could hypothetically hold up to 4 or 5; even then, that would still be only 1200 to 1500 people) 🧠\n\nNow, *rugged individualism*, fuel subsidies, and a multi-decade campaign of influence by the Koch Brothers has prevented this optimization from hitting the real highways, but fortunately the information highways operate in more logical ways. You see people want to use a secure network like Ethereum but they also want fast and affordable transactions ⚖️\n\n## Look Who Just Rolled Up\n\nLayer 2 solutions are not a new concept. Bitcoin’s lightning network was proposed in a 2015 whitepaper and launched officially in 2018. To this day, if you want to transact on Bitcoin, this is the most cost-efficient way to do so… if that’s something people want to do… I’m skeptical it is 😉\n\nI’ve touched on the different kinds of Layer 2 scaling solutions in other posts, so I won’t go too much into the technical differences between state-channels like Lightning and rollups, but for the curious, I definitely recommend **[this post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)** by Ethereum co-founder and lead researcher, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nFor simplicities sake, let’s say that the goal of any Layer2 is to allow transactions to be batched off-chain and settled on chain. Think of this like a trust-minimized version of what Visa or Mastercard do 💳\n\nA rollup, as the name suggests, allows transactions to be rolled up and settled as a little bundle of data to the Ethereum mainnet. There are two main variations of this technology: optimistic rollups and zk-rollups.\n\nZk-rollups are very interesting and certainly a subject we’ll get into in a future post but today I want to focus on the *optimistic rollup*s as they are currently the most popular scaling solution **[by far](https://l2beat.com/)**.\n\n![L2 Beat shows the current TVL of all major scaling solutions](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*-EvynpFs6-diltyYNJZwEQ.png)\n\n## The OGs of OP\n\nOptimism is, as the name alludes, an optimistic rollup. It was built by a team of Ethereum developers with a rather impressive track record. Karl Floersh, the chief technology officer of the non-profit Optimism Foundation which designed the network, previously helped develop Plasma, which serves as the technological base of the popular Polygon PoS Chain. He also worked on Casper, the consensus mechanism employed on the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake network 👻\n\nTogether with fellow Plasma Group teammates, Jinglan Wang and Ben Jones, Karl co-founded Optimism. Plasma and Optimism settle transactions in a similar way, by trusting that validated transactions are correct, but providing a window of time where they can be contested before finalizing them to the Ethereum mainnet. When the results are contested, the original code is run again on the Layer 1 to confirm correctness, at which time they become final.\n\nThis assumption of correctness is the reason for the name optimistic rollups and a big part of why the team chose the name Optimism. The other reason for the name is summarized in the official docs:\n\n> …none of this would be possible without a sense of optimism. Our optimism about the Ethereum vision keeps this project moving forward. We believe in an optimistic future for Ethereum, a future where we get to redesign our relationships to the institutions that coordinate our lives.\n\nIf you watch interviews with Karl or read any of his writing, you will immediately recognize that this is not just marketing speak, but a peak into the ideology that underlies the Optimism Foundation’s design decisions.\n\n## An Increasingly Optimistic Outlook\n\nBy design, rollups are more centralized than so-called Layer 1s, but their use of Ethereum for finality removes the majority of the negative externalities from this. Because the data is available and the code can be run again—and this is especially true for Optimism which is EVM equivalent and moving towards complete Ethereum equivalency in terms of code execution—even a single validator sequencing transactions could do very little in terms of censorship.\n\nBut that’s not to say the protocol is truly decentralized. And the team at Optimism knows this, which is why they’ve begun the process of progressive decentralization 🗳\n\nBut then, you already knew that didn’t you?\n\n## Airdrop #1\n\nYou probably knew about Optimism before you even clicked on this article. Not for the reasons I’ve mentioned above but because recently, there was an airdrop 🪂\n\nThat’s right, back at the end of April, the OP token was officially announced after months of speculation, and the airdrop of tokens became available (by the way, if you haven’t already, **[check if you’re eligible](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check)**!) 👀\n\nThat airdrop accounted for just 5% of the total token supply, a little over 1/4 of the 19% being allocated to all airdrops. So my advice to airdrop farmers is to use the network as much as you can—relative to your needs and financial capacity of course.\n\nThe airdrops are not the whole story though for those looking to acquire tokens. Whether to become stewards of the platform or to benefit financially, those looking to score some free OP will also like this little detail from the official docs:\n\n> 25% of initial OP token supply is allocated for Proactive Project Funding. This will be distributed via community governance, KPI-driven incentives, grants programs, and other mechanisms.\n\nThis brings me to the whole reason I’m writing this article…\n\n## PoolTogether is Live on Optimism\n\nI like grants. In fact, I’ve received multiple grants from PoolTogether’s PoolGrants program that have helped me make content like this 🙏\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with PoolTogether, check out my posts **[The New Wave of DeFi](https://mirror.xyz/thumbsupfinance.eth/dCWR2LJ07dA1JwqgBzSXZjWCDx0Ptq9x7sL_GZR5Hks)**, **[I Joined a DAO and I Like It](https://mirror.xyz/thumbsupfinance.eth/ybaeK-aJHVQAAa6thusVsOQU_F3NUQ6lRRFhhv7ADco)**[,](https://mirror.xyz/thumbsupfinance.eth/ybaeK-aJHVQAAa6thusVsOQU_F3NUQ6lRRFhhv7ADco) and **[Sharing is Caring](https://mirror.xyz/thumbsupfinance.eth/t8bEdFTbi-WqU65n-lSz7w1afMuMk5nKpF5ARXrzO9Q)** for more on what makes this crypto prize-savings protocol so special 💜\n\nPoolTogether also likes grants. In fact, as they prepared to launch the protocol to be on its first rollup, they submitted an application for OP incentives. And the proposal was accepted! 🎉\n\nSo, what does that mean?\n\nPoolTogether received 450,000 OP tokens to distribute to users of the protocol (people who deposit USDC into the prize-savings dApp at **[PoolTogether.com](https://app.pooltogether.com/deposit?network=polygon)**) on Optimism during the campaign.\n\nAccording to the official announcement from PoolTogether, Phase 1 of the distribution will take place over the four weeks beginning…\n\n> …Tuesday, July 26th at 7 pm GMT.\n>\n> Rewards are accrued in real-time and claimable in weekly epochs. For example, the first rewards will be claimable on August 4th at 7 pm GMT.\n>\n> OP tokens will be distributed at a rate of 25,000 per week.\n\nThroughout the campaign, the PoolTogether DAO will discuss how to operate Phase 2 of the distribution. Expect an update to this post, as more information becomes available.\n\nIn the meantime you may be wondering…\n\n## How to Deposit into PoolTogether on Optimism\n\nFor those of you who are new to Optimism, PoolTogether, or both, I’ve got something special just for you: a tutorial for how to get funds onto Optimism and deposit into PoolTogether 👨‍🏫\n\nAnd, because I know that after 1500 words about everything from highways to progressive decentralization, you’re probably sick of reading…\n\nI made a video.

This prompted some Bitcoin analysts to predict short-term upside continuation, with pseudonymous analyst CryptoHamster seeing BTC at $26,000 next.\n\nBut BTC's potential to recover entirely from its ongoing bearish slumber appears low for at least three key reasons.\n\n## Bitcoin bulls have been duped before\n\nBitcoin established its record high of $69,000 in November 2022. Since then, the cryptocurrency has declined by more than 60% while undergoing several mini pumps on its way down. \n\nOn the daily chart, Bitcoin has rebounded at least five times since November 2021, securing 23%-to-40% gains on each recovery. Nonetheless, it has continued its correction every time after forming a local price top around its exponential moving averages (EMA) and then falling to new yearly lows.\n\n*BTC/USD daily price chart featuring 'fakeouts.' Source: TradingView*\n\nThis time looks no different, with Bitcoin facing a bullish rejection in June and recovering nearly 17% a month later. Notably, BTC price faces interim resistance in its 50-day EMA (the red wave) at around $23,150, with a breakout clearing its way toward $27,000, coinciding with the 100-day EMA (black).\n\nAt $27,000, the price would still form a lower high compared to the previous local tops. So, that technically raises the possibility of another bearish continuation move.\n\n## High selling, low buying volume\n\nInterestingly, the volume behavior during the ongoing Bitcoin correction shows a greater interest in selling the coin at local tops.\n\nThe daily chart below illustrates this by highlighting the volume readings during downtrends and uptrends since November 2021. For instance, the last two big price declines in May and June coincided with a sharp increase in selling volumes.\n\n*BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView*\n\nIn comparison, the follow-up rebounds to those price declines accompanied modest to lower trading volumes. The ongoing volume behavior looks the same, peaking during the downtrend and dropping as the price recovers.\n\nThis suggests a weakening upside momentum, which may lead to another price correction.\n\n## BTC to equities correlation flips back to positive\n\nBitcoin is once again tailing stock market trends despite briefly decoupling from them in early July.\n\nFor instance, on July 28, the day-to-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite stood near 0.66. That includes declines in both markets after the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) plunged for a second consecutive quarter.\n\n*BTC/USD and NDAQ daily correlation coefficient. Source: TradingView*\n\nThat officially confirms that the U.S. has entered a “technical recession,” which could weigh negatively on the stock market. Therefore, Bitcoin's downside prospects appear high if its positive correlation with the stock market continues.", "timestamp": 1659058736, "digest": "EVZgtDQvQOPhZTAMBcNLSbq0wRw-K3iaRBHL3sjPl0M", "contributor": "0x52CEb287BEb81D61eDf413A8B3007b611E8917EA"}

领海到哪里\n\n首先说个段子。\n\n有人知道我们的领海是怎么回事么？\n\n有朋友说，那有何难？12海里领海+12海里毗邻区+176海里专属经济区嘛，总共加起来也就是200海里。\n\n那么，我们的领海是从哪里起算向外推12海里的呢？也就是说，领海基线在那里呢？\n\n1958年，中华人民共和国国务院发表声明，我国采用12海里领海。一石激起“三”层浪，因为声明语焉不详，印尼，美国等国家都纷纷来打听，你们的领海到底到哪里啊？\n\n这可不是小事，事涉主权，如果你宣布的范围与他们的冲突，对方自然要提抗议；事情也涉及商业，人家的货轮如果遇难或者被抢，也知道该找谁帮忙救助。可是，我们中国就是不吭声，不肯发表必须附上的海图。\n\n现在回想起来，也真是苦了周总理为首的外交系统，要是那个时候就宣布了海图，跟印尼、菲、马、越、日、韩的关系改善肯定是平添难度了，不发表声明又不行，所以搞了一出有头无尾的戏。\n\n中国不透底，周边国家也就搁置了这件事，反正你还没宣布边界嘛，等宣布了再抗议也来得及。只有美国搁置不了，天天来打听，心里急啊。\n\n美国是海洋大国，又天天在这边晃，又怕莫名其妙发生冲突，通过好多渠道来打听过，其中包括波兰渠道，中国就是不告诉他。12海里领海云云，本来就是对付你的嘛，你急，正好。\n\n说起来，有钱人就是有办法，美国人不像我们有五千年与人斗的智慧，可他们是科学大国啊，别的不会，做试验有的是经费，准备停当，这就做开了试验。\n\n从那年开始，你去看看《人民日报》，隔几天就有一篇声明：“美国悍然入侵我国领海，强烈抗议……”美国也很滑稽，照例是一篇回复：“你没公布你的领海边界，我是误入”。\n\n你来我往，双方都很有耐心，用了几年的时间，美国海空军共计入侵我国领海领空500余次（一说是900余次），此后就不来了。\n\n90年代初，我国《领海法》颁布，宣布领海基线的时候，美国提供了一张图，与我国自定的边界一致。这张图怎么来的呢？\n\n就是美国搞了500次入侵，从外海往里拱啊拱啊，直到中国抗议，赶紧退出去，在海图上作个标记，这就是中国领海了，500个点点下来，互相一连，中国的领海线就清楚了。你说为了这根线，美国人花了多少钱啊。\n\n宕开一笔，美国作为海上霸主，最反对别人搞宽领海了，但后来自己也随大流，为什么呢？且听下回分解。\n\n2  联合国海洋法公约的笑话\n\n本朝自宣布12海里领海以来，长达三十余年不向世界公布领海边界，创造了国际法上的奇观。\n\n这条边界线，就既给我们带来过利益，也多少有些尴尬。\n\n带来利益的例子，打捞阿波丸就是一件，有理有利，还挺仁义；带来祸害的例子，无过于希腊货轮事件。\n\n1973年，希腊籍“波罗的海克里夫”号货轮在台湾海峡受强台风袭击遇险，要求救助，地点在厦门港外不到50海里。台湾，大陆，香港都收到了求救信号，也都表示要前去救援。\n\n这船的船长先生大概是个学国际法的，背得“世界上只有一个中国，中华人民共和国是全中国唯一合法政府”这句话，再加上离大陆确实近，就拒绝了台湾的救援，专心等待“唯一合法政府”救援。\n\n结果厦门根本没有能够在这种风浪下出海的船，无法出海抢救。难船在风浪中挣扎达十多个小时，终于沉没于厦门港外，船上20名船员死了14个，6人被赶来的新加坡商船救起。\n\n这件事之后，据说周总理大发雷霆，立即拨款去日本买了大型专业救捞船，就是著名的“沪救101”，成立了广州和烟台救捞局。\n\n这条船我是未见其生，有幸见其死。\n\n90年代初，这条船从日本回来，快要进入烟台港了，不知道是高压油管破裂还是怎么的，机舱突然起火，船员闻警而动，不去救火，而是抱上从日本买回来的细软，纷纷放救生艇逃走，结果一条已经回到家的大型专业救捞船在锚地烧得只剩了个壳。\n\n回到正题，希腊货轮的例子告诉我们，领海的权益不仅仅是利益，它还意味着责任。\n\n国土是你的，你一定有义务要管好，否则，你很可能对全人类犯下了罪行。破坏本国的生态和保护本国的生态，意义也是如此。美国为了让别人缩窄领海，提出种种理由，只有这一条我挺认同。\n\n本来嘛，那些自己规定了200海里领海的国家，根本就没有维持秩序和援助别人的能力，又依法不许别人管，如果咱们在那片海域里出了事，岂不是晦气到家了？\n\n为了对付美国的海上霸权，联合国里的一帮穷哥们凑起来，张罗着搞一个《联合国海洋法公约》，对海洋权益的各个方面逐一定义。\n\n话说，一帮穷人要对付地球村首富，瓜分海洋，每家200海里，山姆大善人岂能不知？这不是压缩美国海军的活动空间吗？美国是坚决反对，政府不签约，更谈不上国会批准。\n\n《联合国海洋法公约》也就因此变成了一个玩具，眼看要无疾而终。谁知道峰回路转，里根时期，美国终于出了一位矮人，他矮在哪里呢？此人可以看见自己的海岸！\n\n原来美国人一向高瞻远瞩，只看得见别人家的海岸，从来不知道自己家也有海岸的。里根政府突然发现，世界上原来只有他是面临两个大洋的国家，而且海外一望无际，不需要跟任何人平分什么专属经济区，更不用说领海了。\n\n原来《联合国海洋法公约》一旦公布，他才是最大的得益者，所以立即行动，政府批准，说服国会通过，动员其他海洋国家签约，快马加鞭，《联合国海洋法公约》终于从玩具变成了工具。\n\n可是原来想联合起来对付富人的把戏，结果还是富人沾光，马太效应果然不凡，“凡有的，还要加给他叫他多余；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。”\n\n《联合国海洋法公约》的制定和生效过程，就是这样一幕含泪的喜剧。说是喜剧，里边自然还有笑料。\n\n诸君试看其中的《公海》一章。开宗明义，好像是“公海是全人类共同的财产，只能够用于和平用途”，鄙人家里的《海洋法公约》早已束之高阁，大意如此吧。\n\n这段话堂堂皇皇，美国中央司令部不干了，据说他们的一位司令长官专门跑到一个研讨会上请教专家：公海既然只能用于和平用途，那运兵算不算？运军火算不算？两国掐架，难道要约好了到谁家里去打？\n\n不知道专家怎么答复。\n\n3  东海的分割兼谈划界规则\n\n国家对海洋的权利基于陆地，没有陆地谈什么领海？但有了陆地，领海怎么定呢？大致上有这么几个原则：\n\n1、自然延伸原则：就是所谓大陆架，是大陆的延伸，延伸到哪里算哪里，直到海底地形突然一沉，就算是大洋了，大陆架也就到头，土地权利延伸的极限就在这里了。\n\n2、人口比例原则：人口多的国家多分一点。\n\n3、相向岸线长度比例原则：岸线长的国家多分一点。注意，这里说的是相向岸线，只是争议双方相对的部分，不是指海岸线总长度。\n\n4、中分原则：把争议地区一分两半，最直观的分法。\n\n我们对于日本主要坚持的是大陆架自然延伸原则，边界到冲绳海槽中线。按照这个原则，日本大概只会剩下二三十海里的样子，中国几乎把东海全占光，成了名副其实的东中国海。日本当然不干了。\n\n日本提出的理由是：日本的东西两面都有海槽，东面的海槽举世闻名，乃是马里亚纳海沟，一万多米深，乃是个喜马拉雅山放进去都不露头的大坑，外边才是真正的西北太平洋。\n\n所以日本说，这个冲绳海槽，其实是大陆架上的一个凹陷，并不是陆架的终点，马里亚纳海沟才是终点。\n\n这样一来，日本和中国就是共大陆架的国家，延伸原则不适用。日本提出的原则是中分，中国不予理睬，但是在事实上也从来不在中分线的对面搞什么动作，所谓不欲多事是也。\n\n这虽属无奈，却不是什么好事，因为这个行动本身会说明一些问题，让对手猜到了我们的底线。中国提出来的让步，基本上是坚持大陆架延伸原则，可以考虑岸线长度比例原则稍作调整。\n\n至于人口比例原则，日本自然是不提，中国好像也没提，大概是倚多为胜，胜之不武，不好意思吧，也可能是依据已经充分，不需要再提。\n\n东海的划界问题之所以十分讨厌，因为它还要涉及到韩国。\n\n韩国也宣布过12海里领海和200海里专属经济区，中国当即声明不承认，但是此后也约束自己的军舰船舶，不得越线。我们大概就是在韩国声称的领海内进行过科学考察的最后一批中国人了吧。\n\n韩国与中国是典型的共大陆架国家，延伸原则不适用。看到中国与日本谈判，中国愿意引入岸线比例原则，韩国就要求中韩双方按照岸线比例来分，但中国严词拒绝。\n\n为什么呢？\n\n诸位去看看地图，中国对着韩国的海岸是江苏和上海，岸线平直，其实是很短的，韩国对着中国的岸线锯齿狼牙，其实很长，按照这个比例，中国大大吃亏，所以坚决不认。\n\n估计这片海域将来会中分了事，中国稍微让一点也有可能。\n\n看到这里就清楚了，国际法上的划界原则，其实只是一种说法而已，到了最后，还是要看谁的力气大。中国在小小一个东海，对不同的对象坚持不同的原则，唯一的取舍标准还是国家利益。\n\n日韩都曾经提出要和中国进行东海划界的多边谈判，中国一直是坚持双边原则，一家一家谈。这可是周恩来定下的老规矩。\n\n中国宁肯在双边谈判中多让步，也不参加多边谈判，这是一百多年来中国与各国列强打交道血的教训，只要有可能就会坚持。\n\n前面有朋友谈可以请国际法院管辖，不要说国际法院需要争议各方主动接受管辖，承认并执行其判决，审判又旷日持久。中国政府和中国人民，是绝对不会允许把国家民族的根本利益交到几个专家或者第三方手中的。\n\n我们可以相信自己的公正，却不能寄希望于外国的调停、干预，更不用说判决了。所以我们只往国际法院送大法官，给别人判案，自己的事情么，还是握在自己手里比较好。\n\n说到这里，朋友们可能不知道，七十年代后期邓公与日本谈海洋权益的时候，我们还根本没有海底地形图，是拿着海军的航海图去的，日本资料反倒很详尽，那叫一个被动。\n\n邓公回来后大搞海洋调查。到今天，可以说我们掌握的水文、地质、化学等海洋资料数据之周密翔实，已经不弱于日本，可以说，总算把家门口的事情搞清楚了。\n\n为了这些数据不惜血本，八十年代中后期，我国自己造的（其实是用货轮改的）向阳红5号和向阳红10号两条万吨级远洋考察船都名列世界十大考察船之列。\n\n图片\n\n10号还兼有通信船之职责，天线密布，蔚为壮观，350多个床位，40多个实验室，在我们业内人眼里，比起军舰，也许更令人自豪。\n\n为了这些数据，每年都有人牺牲殉职。\n\n我的两个校友留学归来，参加海洋调查，潜水死在黄海；海洋二所的科研人员，为了取得强台风的潮位资料被风浪卷到礁石上摔死；大洋协会两个人为了在西北太平洋考察中取得先驱勘探权，在向阳红16号上因船难牺牲。\n\n今天可以跟人家摆事实讲道理，全是靠人命和金钱堆起来的实力后盾，如果不是国力的提高，谁来理你！\n\n4  图们江入海权与西北太平洋形势\n\n尽管临海，但中国在传统上就是大陆国家，海洋一直代表着危险和反叛，而不是代表着机会，历朝政府都防范有加。\n\n所以有人打过来时，割地赔款，肉痛得很，跟我们要一点海洋权利，倒是立刻答应。所谓天朝弃之，蛮人得之，于我为无用之物，于彼有活命之资，从来就不当回事的，乐得做好人。\n\n西方国家则不然，在出海口问题上争得拼死拼活，在一个水面占了70%的水球（而不是地球）上，谁掌握海洋谁就掌握世界，这才是大国的根本，而出海通道，则是第一步。\n\n在出海通道问题上，日思夜想，经常要大打出手的最突出茨手，就是我们的北方邻居俄罗斯。为了获得通向大洋的道路，为了获得不冻港，为了成为一个海洋国家，他们迁都、侵略、吞并、欺诈、合作，用尽了手段。\n\n你去看看圣彼得堡的历史、塞瓦斯托波尔的历史、塔林的历史、大连的历史、血泪斑斑，都和他们有关。\n\n这里要说的是《瑷珲条约》和图们江的故事。由于时间久远，家里的书和资料又都不在手边，纯凭记忆写来，不一定对，欢迎指正，有时间的话再改写一次。\n\n大家注意一下中国东北吉林黑龙江的地图，有没有发现靠海的地方都属于俄罗斯？\n\n老毛子对于海洋的贪婪和我天朝对海洋的无谓，两种态度合成了这条国界线，记载在一个文件上——《瑷珲条约》。\n\n从此，东三省被隔绝于大洋之外，只有辽宁还留有对内海的港口。\n\n闭关锁国的年代，我们不需要海洋；贫穷落后的中国，海洋对于我们也只意味着几条鱼虾。\n\n但是一个强大的中国需要什么呢？\n\n必须成为一个海洋国家！\n\n政治上要求我们走向海洋；经济上要求我们走向海洋，开发海洋；为了保障这一切，军事上，我们必须能够自由地航行在大海上！\n\n然而有岛链。海洋环境是严酷的，不通过岛链我们不能进入西北太平洋，不通过马六甲海峡我们不能进入印度洋，而这些咽喉要地，都控制在别人手里。\n\n每天有无数只眼睛盯着你，无数只耳朵在倾听，大门随时可以关闭。一旦关闭，贸易将停止，能源将枯竭，军舰出不去回不来。\n\n那些陶醉于我国海上力量建设的朋友们，可曾想到这一点？一支可能出不去的舰队？一支出去了就可能回不来的舰队？光强大有什么用？\n\n对马海战和两次大战中德国海军的遭遇，不都证明了拥有开放性通道的重要性吗？别看前几天有条潜艇招招摇摇地过大隅海峡回来，那是溜出去的！正好证明了你不能正大光明地自由出入。\n\n所以，每次看到中国地图，看到右上方的地形，心里总是一股苦味久久不去。哪怕在这里有一点靠海也好啊，我们就可以拥有一条绕过岛链，奔向大洋的北方出路，怎么老祖宗就都不要了呢？\n\n然而绝处有生机。八十年代，在海洋法学界有一个大的盛事，就是重新发现我们拥有图们江的入海权。\n\n《瑷珲条约》是中国政府签订的没有中文本的国际条约，它只有满文、蒙文和俄文本，也就是说，如果你只懂汉语，你没有办法合法地理解它。\n\n后来的《中俄北京条约》基本追认了这个丧权辱国的条约。从此，中国的海岸，就永远和日本海、鄂霍茨克海说再见了。\n\n但是据说，瑷珲条约的俄文本中，留了一段文字，说是中国渔民可以合法地在图们江上航行，也可以合法地通过图们江出海，因为他们以捕捞大马哈鱼为生。\n\n谈判的时候，我们请了一位法国传教士作翻译，是他自作主张写上了这段文字，后来勘界的时候，吴大澄坚持了此条。\n\n我们从图们江入海，需要沿江航行15公里，有了这15公里的航行权和出海权，就有了一个出气孔，将来未必不能成大气候。\n\n所以外交部发出说帖，取得俄朝两国认同，先派渔民，然后弄了一条小小的考察船，沿图们江进入日本海，两家没有异议，权利就落到实处了。\n\n要把这个权利弄成有意义有价值的东西，还需要做很多工作。\n\n我们倡议建立图们江口国际开发区，一直张罗到联合国；图们江上横着很矮的俄朝铁路界桥，我们的大船出不去，要做工作请他们加高，朝鲜还要从中作梗，要说服，要拿东西来交换。\n\n这个航行权最初是为了渔民捕捞大马哈鱼而设的，在没有成气候之前，大马哈鱼可千万不能绝种，所以每年我们都要往江里投放大马哈鱼鱼苗。\n\n可笑吧，可是没有办法，没有人会喜欢邻居强大的，俄国和朝鲜也不例外，只有细雨微风，缓缓图之。\n\n在我的心中，总有一天，或买或租，我们会在图们江口拥有一块港口飞地，直下日本海和鄂霍次克海的梦想一定会实现。\n\n我们这个国家，至少衰落了两百年了，病去如抽丝，今天力图中兴，急不来的。\n\n最后，我觉得应该寻访后人，给那位法国传教士发一个大勋章。\n\n5  南海啊南海\n\n南海真是个好地方，如果有可能，建议各位一定想办法去一次，我觉得比去西藏值得。何况西藏永远不会是别人的，南海嘛，还有不少麻烦，也许将来会有很大一部分是外国了。\n\n所谓南海问题，包括西沙和南沙问题，主要是指南沙问题，到底是怎么来的呢？是谁首先宣布南海是中国领海？又是根据什么呢？\n\n清朝的皇帝，连领土也保不住，知不知道有领海这回事也都难说，自然不会主张海权。民国建立后，太平日子没有几天，不是内战就是外患，然后是世界大战，幸亏站在了胜利者一边，这才有南沙问题，要是站在输家一边，今天可能还没资格谈这个问题呢。\n\n说来也奇怪，中国人每逢大事，点子奇准，两次大战，都站在赢家一边。第一次是名胜实败，第二次则是中了大奖，所获奇丰，弄了个有否决权的常任理事国当当。\n\n到现在快六十年了，还是玩得兴高采烈，多少比我们有钱的人眼睛红得出血，也想参加进来，可我们玩我们的，就是不给你玩。\n\n话说1946年，林遵率舰队收复诸岛，说是收复，我看还是有接收失败者财产的成分在，有些岛屿其实不知道是谁的，日本人占了，又输给了我们，我们自然就笑纳。\n\n跟随舰队出海的，有一位地质矿产部的司长级官员，大笔一挥，用九条虚线划了一个大口袋，这个口袋大到什么程度？我们的地图上都只好另开一个新窗口，专门显示它。回来以后，印到国民政府的地图上，公诸于世，边界线就这样出笼了。\n\n本来我们画了图，说我们家的院子到哪里哪里，邻居们有话快说，有屁快放，不说，就当你们没有意见了，但是这伙邻居几乎十年都不吭声。\n\n直到五十年代中期到七十年代，这伙邻居这才陆续跑出来主张主权。我们自然是得理不饶人：“你们有意见为什么不早提？现在我们都管了这么多年了，哼哼！”\n\n那帮家伙也挺委屈。1946年的菲律宾还没有独立，美国还罩着他呢，应该美国替他出头的。美国被土著人吵得头晕，正准备撂挑子让他们独立，哪里还有心情管这等鸟事，所以没有态度。\n\n马来西亚和印度尼西亚的情况也差不多，革命党刚从树林子里钻出来，或者还没钻出来，东西南北还摸不清楚，谁看见过中国印的这张图？又有谁知道该抗议呢？\n\n越南当时正打得如火如荼，保大皇帝自保不暇，法国老大到处救火，也顾不上管这档子事啊。\n\n不管怎么说，主权这玩意有时候就像西式结婚，要公告一家伙。牧师大人庄严宣布：“有异议现在提，否则永远闭嘴。”“什么？没有人有意见啊，那就这么定了！祝福你们，阿门。”\n\n但是这九段线划得实在是太那个了一点，基本上都是沿着人家的海岸线划的，人家家里内讧结束，当然要出来理论一番，南沙争端，于是越演越烈。\n\n这九段虚线到底是什么线？它既不是领海基线，也不是领海线，它的法律意义到底是什么？这个，呃，官方好像也没说清楚。\n\n所以，1995年公布领海基线的时候，我们根本就不提。海洋法学界内部，就称之为九条断续线。\n\n图片\n\n爱国的诸位同胞，可有人去数过从越南沿海到巴士海峡，围这个大口袋到底用了几条线？\n\n不管怎么说，这个时候可不能发书呆子气，什么依法办事之类的。前朝给我们留了一个理由，我们就要用足。找新的理由，付诸实际行动，去争、去那啥，弄多少算多少。\n\n具体的行动，大家可以看到岛礁上驻守的战士，捕鱼的真假渔民，护航的渔政船和军舰，还有大部分人不知道的。\n\n十年以前，地矿部，国家海洋局，海洋石油总公司联合搞了一个南沙海域的物探调查，弄了一架飞机空中来搞。\n\n据说当时外交部紧张得要死，所以最后的实施方案不是按照一般的物探方法从一侧开始逐条勘查，而是先在最中间，肯定没有争议的地区飞了一个来回，看看没有人抗议，再往左右扩一点，再扩一点，结果全部勘测了一遍，邻居都不吭声，于是得胜还朝。\n\n实际上呢？这周围都是穷邻居，可能根本就没有空中监控力量，不知道你在干啥呢。如果是在东海啊，那就早把答复邻居的抗议照会都拟好了再出海的啊，他们哪里会看不见。\n\n结合后面的几个说明，我的观点是：\n\n钓鱼岛问题的实质是“保”。\n\n主权是明确的，就是属于我们。我们的一切工作，都是捍卫主权，在法律上根本就不会承认日本的什么权利，永远都不会。\n\n即使他现在占着，那也还是我们家的东西，不管未来能不能拿回来，但子子孙孙都要给我记牢，那是我们家的，有朝一日时机成熟，一定要拿回来。\n\n南沙问题的实质是“争”。\n\n法律上确实有问题，但先下手为强，争得多少是多少，为此杀人放火则没必要。\n\n附带说一句，本系列全属谬论，放之四海而皆不准。而且在十年前我就是这个观点，当时就不合时宜。我姑妄言之，各位姑妄听之吧。\n\n6  中国对南海的主权主张\n\n谈到南海的权利，我们喜欢说一句话，叫做自古以来就如何如何，有时高兴起来，还要加上“神圣”两个字，这就是所谓历史性证据。\n\n南海的历史性证据，主要是渔民世世代代捕捞的传统生产证据。还有就是在诸岛上发现很多中国人生活过的证据，什么铜钱、船具、水井、房屋等等。\n\n可是这些证据，在现代国际法上的意义已经越来越小。国际上真正大家都承认的过硬的证据，就是实际控制。\n\n你说那里是你的，你有没有去管理过？那里的人服不服管？别人是否都没有意见？这些问题的答案如果都是“是”，你多半就赢了。\n\n在西沙，我们就有这样的依据，在南沙，好像还没有，幸好别人也没有。毕竟我们只是路远够不着，而邻居们那时候很可能还住在树上，有时候宰两个人吃吃什么的，谈不上主权二字。\n\n（在钓鱼岛，则是日本人实际在管，那里没有人住，中国从一开始就坚决反对，而且是持续反对，有了这第三点，日本在那里的主权成立不了的，我们很有耐心地不断抗议，奥妙也在这里。）\n\n滑稽的事总会有，在西沙就出了这么一件。越南海洋法学家搜罗旧闻，发现了这么一件奇事，如获至宝，谈判的时候，当作王牌打出来了。\n\n原来在清朝的时候（什么年间我忘了，大概在咸丰同治之间），有一条法国货船运铜经过西沙海域，遭遇海盗，被抢了个精光。根据海上的货运规则，这时候应该到当地政府报案，请求缉捕海盗，政府并且出具证明，回去后就可以向货主交待，并向保险公司索赔。\n\n法国船长于是就把船开到最近的海南岛榆林港，向当地知府（也许是知县？）报案。咱们是中国人，熟知政府官员的作风，当时又是洋人甚嚣尘上的时代，大家都是避之则吉。此后发生的事情，那是用脚趾头都想得出来。\n\n那官员告诉船长，我这里叫做天涯海角，天朝上邦到此就为止了，你那个海外，谁知道在哪里？你被抢了，我们不负责任，管不了，也不想管。就这么把被抢船长送出了衙门。\n\n但是这件事需要有个了结啊，要不然回法国就不好交待了。于是法国船长只好驶向越南海防港，那里的地方官员倒挺好地给他开了个证明，还派了条小船出去转了一圈，算是缉捕过了。\n\n这是什么证据？这就是实际控制和治理的证据。这个证据说明，中国政府早在清朝，就不承认西沙是本国领土，也不承担那里的治安等工作。而当时的越南政府不但认为西沙是越南领土，而且实施了维持秩序的工作。这还不说明西沙自古以来就属于越南吗？\n\n如果您是中国的谈判代表，受过海洋法和国际法的充分训练，面对这样一个证据，会怎么办？真得恨不得乘时光机器回去杀了那个知府啊。\n\n实际的对付方法无非是两条：一条是提出我们自己的更多证据；另一条则是不加理睬，也不争辩，让实力自己去说话。\n\n到底采用了什么方法？反正直到如今，西沙是我们的，而且永远是我们的。\n\n话又说回来，官员应该学法守法，已经成为公务员培训的共识，但是，地方官员一般不需要学国际法，真的不需要吗？\n\n7  无权一身轻\n\n环绕南海这九条断续线，是我们争取南沙海洋权益漫天要价的上限，超过这个范围，我们肯定是不会再提什么要求的，在这条线内部，其实是可以商量的。问题在于对国民不好交待。\n\n这九条断续线，其法律意义到底是什么？是领海？群岛海域？历史性海域？谁也不知道。\n\n首先，会是领海吗？\n\n不会的。前面说过，国家对海洋的权力基于大陆，也就是海权基于陆权。要确定领海，先要建立领海基线，要划领海基线，先要定领海基点。\n\n领海基点必须是主权无争议的岛屿或大陆；基点之间直线距离不得超过24海里，也就是领海加毗连区的距离；时隐时现，低潮时才出露的礁石和浅滩不算数；更严格一点的话，最好岛上是能有人类居住条件的。\n\n南沙符合哪一点？除了国民党当时占领的一部分，几乎都不太符合。我们的教科书上说到南海诸岛，都要说一句“南到曾母暗沙”。暗沙暗沙，自然是不露头的暗礁，暗礁暗礁，陆都没有，谈什么海权？\n\n所以这句话在法律上是有瑕疵的。这九条断续线包围的肯定不是领海，那就要另找理由，那么多岛礁，可不可以说成是群岛海域呢？印度尼西亚可以，咱们也可以来个千岛之国嘛！\n\n群岛海域是《联合国海洋法公约》承认的主权海域。根据《联合国海洋法公约》，群岛海域的构成需要具备几个条件：\n\n1、水域面积和陆地面积（包括环礁）的比例应该在一比一到九比一之间。\n\n2、基线长度不得超过100海里，允许有3%超标，超标部分也不得长于125海里。南沙那个地方岛礁又小，相互距离又远，根本达不到这两个标准。\n\n退一万步说，就算我们勉强宣布基线，相邻国家也没有意见，麻烦又来了。\n\n基线确定后，基线包围的海域就成为内水，内水的上方就成为领空。国家对内水的管理可不是一般的严格，完全依据国内法，而不是国际法。\n\n原则上外国船舶、包括军舰就不能自由通过了，要想通过，必须事先通报，请求批准，浮上水面，挂起旗帜，快速航行，不得停船，不得下锚，弄不好还会要求你解除武装。\n\n要想不这么麻烦，就必须设立群岛水道和空中航道，供外国船舶飞机通过。\n\n这条有些勉强，但是可以争争看！脚下如果没有坚实的大地，有块木板也是好的。但这不够，还要找其他理由。\n\n想破了脑袋，还是从“世世代代”这四个字上做文章。我们可以宣布南沙是我们的“历史性海域”！这个地方是我们历史上就经营的地方，渔民赖以为生，商业贸易依赖这一通道，所谓民生赖之，不可离弃。\n\n这个理由看上去不错。别人也有这种海域，比如加拿大的哈得逊湾，大家去看一下北美地图，那个口袋其实很大的，要按照12海里领海制度，中间都是公海，可是加拿大就是宣布这里是历史性海域，袋口一扎，里面都是我们家的东西。\n\n但是按下葫芦瓢起来，我们这个主张刚试探了一下，周边诸国还没反应呢，几个海洋和航运大国，包括美日就都来问：“听说你们要宣布这里是历史性海域？那以后我们路过的时候岂不是都要先请示汇报？”\n\n原来这里是国际海运的重要通道，每天千帆竞渡。一旦宣布为历史性海域，国家对其的管理接近对内水的管理，不但要管海洋，还要管天空，还要按照国内法来管。\n\n这样都行，岂不是生杀大权全操于我？想抓就抓，想审就审，不要说路过的军舰，路过的客商不是也很不放心？\n\n这个干法，其实相当于宣布我们家门口的高速公路是我们家自留地的一部分，我想乘凉就乘凉，想晒场就晒场，过路人肯定有意见。要强行宣布，难度极大。\n\n正因为如此，前文谈到，我们批准了《联合国海洋法公约》会吃亏，至少南沙问题就没有办法坚持原来的立场，只能跟邻居商量着来。但是在商量之前，还是要尽量占一点地方，多一点讨价的砝码，理由嘛，“自古以来”嘛！\n\n南沙周边诸国的抢占活动，其实相当于我们国内拆迁以前的抢搭违章建筑。当然是非法的，国家也不承认，但是到了补偿的时候，还是会考虑的。\n\n不但邻居争地盘如此，公共汽车上争坐位更是这样，先扔一个包包过去，别人想坐，就可以大喝一声：“有人了！”这句话有什么法律依据？没有，奇怪的是大家看见这个包包，听了这句话，多数会乖乖走开，另找地方去了。大家承认，那就行了，这就叫做惯例的力量。\n\n这里要顺便说一句，前些年，有些人策划在公海上建立流动广播电台，向中国发送政治性广播，后来无疾而终。为什么不敢干呢？\n\n原来海洋法公约明确规定了这种情况，只要出现这样的广播船，可以收到广播的任何国家的法院均可以接受起诉，加以审判，本国军舰可以实施登临权，即使你在公海上也一样。\n\n所以只要该船开始广播，大陆可以收听到，法院一判，军舰就可以立即出发去抓人，管你在不在公海。这几个人只想做先驱，不想做先烈，自然是偃旗息鼓。\n\n中国加入《联合国海洋法公约》，其实是大势所趋，吃不消像美国那样耍赖的。南沙问题上吃一点亏，也是必然，东海上就沾光了嘛！\n\n加入《联合国海洋法公约》，放弃了一点权益，却明确了规则，这叫做无权一身轻，今后谈判起来容易一点，对国民交待起来，也有个依据。\n\n赶紧跟四邻把地界划清楚了，大家都是好邻居，可以专心建设，也省得别人挑拨离间，天天扯皮，好处还是不少的。\n\n8  舍命开荒的大国意识、大洋勘探与开发\n\n知不知道中国有个“大洋协会”？知道他们是干什么的吗？\n\n《联合国海洋法公约》写得很滑稽，有大量的篇幅在谈一个叫做“区域”的地方，在谈一个叫做“管理局”的机构。分章累节，把个公约弄得像个企业章程。这是为什么呢？\n\n《联合国海洋法公约》出台以后，各国瓜分临近海洋的斗争进入白热化。但是另有一块，就是公海，则相对沉寂。\n\n这块地方约占地球表面积的一半，表面上可以航行捕捞，海底可是有丰富的矿藏。大家嘴上都承认这是全人类共同财产，实际上却各怀心思。这块地方有多重要呢？\n\n用专业的语言说就是“国际海底区域是地球上具有特殊法律地位的最大的政治地理单元”。\n\n您琢磨琢磨这句话，不感觉到应该赶紧插手吗？大洋底下，有多少矿藏呢？什么可燃冰之类的新玩意不说，光说大家都知道的多金属结核。\n\n这一种矿物，其中含有锰、铁、镍、钴、铜等几十种元素。世界海洋3500—6000米深的洋底储藏有3万亿吨，太平洋海底储量最多。其中锰的产量可供世界用1.8万年，镍可用2.5万年。\n\n实际上，在风波险恶的大洋，几千到近万米的水深，要查清楚有什么矿并不容易，要捞上来就更难，要以合理的成本实现商业开采，就更更更难。\n\n咱们河里多的是学自然科学的人，几千个大气压意味着什么，大家都清楚，不是财雄势大的有钱人，是干不了这件事的。\n\n有钱人干，难道穷人只眼睁睁看着么？穷哥们联合起来，在《联合国海洋法公约》里规定了又规定，内容大致如下：\n\n1、国际海底及其资源，任何国家或个人不得据为己有，任何国家也不能自由开发，而是人类的共同继承财产。\n\n2、国际海底区域及其资源实行国际管理，联合国在1994年《公约》生效时专门成立国际海底管理局，代表全人类行使管理权，总部设在牙买加。\n\n但是穷人毕竟是穷人，自己开发不了，又不准别人开发，也太说不过去了吧。最好是富人出钱，富人出力，穷人沾光。\n\n所以关于国际海底矿产资源的开发制度，《联合国海洋法公约》规定实行平行开发制。\n\n即一方面由联合国国际海底管理局企业部开发，它可以直接牵头把有钱的企业或者个人组织起来，自己动手开发；\n\n另一方面由有关国家及其自然人和法人与管理局以协作方式开发，勘探资料要全部上缴管理局一套。\n\n可是，美国日本等国家，早就开始了有关勘探工作，海底下有这些矿，还是他们发现的！所以为了照顾对资源勘探进行了大量投资的国家的需求，承认它们的优先勘探权。\n\n这个优先勘探权附加了不少条件，全都是为了保证穷人沾光的，富人咬咬牙，也就承担下来了。我们中国，本来应该属于穷人，可这次不惜血本，挤到富人堆里去了。\n\n大国就应该干一些只有大国才能干得了的事情，做大事，争大权，让别人学不去，追不上，不要和穷人去争一些鸡毛蒜皮。\n\n美国，日本，是最早干洋底勘探这件事的，中国和印度紧紧跟上，中国要稍微快一点。韩国、巴西、菲律宾和泰国等，也在积极准备，并且正在申请矿区。\n\n1991年，中国大洋协会在国际海底管理局和国际海洋法法庭筹备委员会登记注册为国际海底开发先驱者，在领海和专属经济区以外的国际海底区域分配到15万平方公里的开辟区，马上开始勘探调查。\n\n1999年，完成开辟区调查，弄清情况后，按照约定，上交勘查资料，放弃开辟区内50%区域的开采权（这些都算上交的管理费），中国大洋协会为我国在上述区域获得7.5万平方公里具有专属勘探权和优先商业开采权的金属结核矿区，当然是我们挑过的富矿区。\n\n想一想，只比江苏省面积小一点的矿区，下面铺了将近200米厚的金属矿藏，这已经是我们的了。是不是该庆祝呢？我觉得值得。因为反过来想的话，如果我们丢了这么大一块地，多半要\\*了。\n\n目前，我们已经和国际海底管理局签订了《勘探合同》，从国际海底开辟活动的先驱投资者成为国际海底资源勘探的承包者。\n\n等到我们的深海机器人造好，采矿和运输技术成熟，也许在10年之内，就可以看到太平洋捞回来的锰和镍了。\n\n争夺海洋权益的的斗争，并不总是刀光剑影的，经常是在神不知鬼不觉的情况下完成的。开发勘探大洋，我们现在的水平大概是全球第三名。\n\n图片\n\n一般来说，研究大洋勘探技术和勘探工作，需要15年以上的时间，开采技术实用化，需要15到20年的时间，到了现在，只要我们不停步，落后于我们的人，大概赤脚也追不上了。\n\n开发大洋的意义和它对我国科研水平和工艺水平的促进，我觉得只比两弹一星低一点点。谓予不信，可以试看今后的国家科技进步奖名单。\n\n7\\.5万平方公里的权益，这就是大洋协会的工作成就。外交部，国家海洋局，原地矿部等部委功不可没。\n\n照这个路子走下去，也许今后我们会有幸看到一个漂浮的中国，一个每三五年就会扩张五万平方公里左右的海底国土。\n\n这个地方，目前就在夏威夷以北，日本以东，美国西边的太平洋上，大概就是当年日本偷袭珍珠港的出发地左近，也是奇特的巧合。\n\n真的是要奋斗就会有牺牲，我们不但每年要为此付出几千万的勘测资金，也付出了其他的沉重代价。\n\n向阳红16号就是执行大洋勘探任务的途中沉没的，还死了三个人。回忆起这条船，现在还觉得她很漂亮。\n\n图片\n\n4400吨，线条优美，停在国家海洋局东海分局浦东高桥码头，紧贴着雄伟的向阳红10号，犹如一对柔情蜜意的情人。跑起来又快又稳，可以高速到达目标区；低速性能又好，可以拖着考察设备慢慢游弋。\n\n在八十年代，那是世界顶级配置的科学考察船，不要说实验室了，在刚脱离“先生产，后生活”模式的新船里，生活非常舒服。里边的首席科学家舱室，比宾馆不差。\n\n乘这条船出海，大家都是很羡慕的。当时的向阳红16号，几乎专业搞大洋勘探了。\n\n坏也就坏在“羡慕”这两个字上。\n\n向阳红16号在1993年沉没在济州岛附近，当地水深好像只有80来米。据传闻，这应该是一起责任事故。\n\n简单的说，当时出海考察是有补贴的，向阳红16号是新船，舒服，又老是跑西北太平洋，停靠夏威夷，有美金可拿，所以参加大洋考察是美差。\n\n美差就要轮流去，这也是咱们国家的惯例。所以不知从什么时候起，向阳红16号的船员队伍不再是固定的，而是在东海分局系统内轮换。\n\n如果我记忆不错，这一年是轮到了宁波的四大队为主。临时的船员队伍，未经磨合，对船舶也不熟悉，船未出港，隐患已经埋下了。\n\n这条船上不但装备了全世界最先进的多频海底扫描系统，海洋二所带上了深海专用的海底照相机。\n\n由于经常要在远离航线的海区作业，船上的航行保障系统也是第一流的，除了航行的雷达系统，还装备了自动报警避碰雷达，是进口的第一流设备。\n\n由于赶路，晚上起雾的时候，船速并未合理降低。进入济州岛海域，当地是传统渔场，有许多小渔船作业，为了防止被大船撞击，这些渔船多数装备有雷达反射器。\n\n向阳红16号上的避碰雷达，只要发现一英里内有回波，就会嘟嘟地叫个不停，值班船员听得心烦，竟然把避碰雷达关闭了！这是祸害的开始。\n\n凌晨四点左右，“银角”号液化石油气船出现在雷达屏幕上，值班员作了记录，但并未改变航向。按照道理，四点半左右还应该记录一次“银角”号的船位的。\n\n一旦发现“银角”号两次船位的连线指向雷达中心位置，就要立即考虑碰撞的可能性，看惯矢量图的朋友，应该一说就明白了。但直到五点，向阳红16号没有改变航向航速，银角号也没有。\n\n五点五分，银角号从浓雾中出现，两船相距只有约200米，我船向东南，对方向东北，正在沿直角方向冲向灾难的汇合点。\n\n这时候的一般惯例，是双方向右舷转向，各自从对方的船尾通过。\n\n但是不知为什么，也许是我们太靠近对方船头，也许是对自己的机动性和速度有信心，向阳红16号打了左舵，企图从“银角”号船头加速通过，而这时“银角”号正在向右转向，正好在双方的新航线上形成了致命的交点。\n\n4400吨的考察船被3.8万吨的大船撞击，连对方的甲板也看不见，在腰部被“银角”号球鼻艏冲进挑起，形成一个大洞。\n\n“银角”号主锚因为紧急刹车向前荡过来，那么一大个铁钩子撞进了上层舱室然后又荡出去，正好扫过两张高低床，大洋协会一位官员，中国建设银行（贷款单位）一位干部在睡梦中当即牺牲。\n\n撞击发生后，“银角”号立即退出一海里外停船，这一退，原来被它的球鼻艏堵住的大洞立即进水，十来分钟就沉下去了。\n\n事件发生后，我们对“银角”号多有指责，但是按照海上避碰规则，它的责任是不大的。\n\n首先小船让大船是惯例，它不变更航向航速不能说错；其次，它急速退出导致了我船加速沉没，有责任，但是它装的是液化天然气，在运载危险易爆货物时，应该首先防范连锁爆炸，在被撞船舶有可能爆炸燃烧的时候，它迅速退开应该是正确的。\n\n说到失误，有一个问题我不明白，为什么直到撞船，双方都没有用16频道联络一下呢？\n\n最后的索赔好像也不成功。为了这件事，当时的总指挥，东海分局党委书记，第一次南极考察的英雄船长张志挺好像被撤职，陈局长也背了处分。\n\n当时随船的是负责大洋勘探主要任务的海洋二所，最后一个含泪的笑话出在他们这里。为了减少科研经费支出，课题组可以多分一点奖金，勘探设备竟然都没有参加保险，一家伙沉下去，无法获赔，真真是亏煞老本。\n\n就大洋勘探而论，这件事的直接后果就是害的我国差一点耽误了规定的最后勘探期限，不得不赶紧奔俄罗斯买了一条船回来，现名“大洋一号”，因为急着买，老毛子狂敲竹杠，实际成交价格比预算价格翻了一倍还不止，据说朱镕基大发雷霆云云。\n\n但是不管怎么说，船员和科学家要去赚那个漂泊四海才来的补贴，可见其生计之艰难。所谓含泪的笑剧，我还是希望大家能够不要责怪他们的。\n\n我们学海洋的同学，在美国工作的人，据说出海的工作特别容易找。美国鬼子，谁愿意经年累月漂泊啊。我们的科研人员，却是经常出海的。\n\n说实在的，1963年邓小平亲自批准成立国家海洋局，第一任局长就是中将。这些年来，国家海洋局和外交部在海军和海洋石油总公司的协助下，争了不少权益。\n\n邓小平复出后，七十年代末投下血本，建立了世界首屈一指的顶级考察船队，作为一个穷国，真是不容易。到了二十年后的今天，悄悄地成了世界第三号海底勘查开发大国。\n\n现在能源紧缺，大家看见东海油气田和南海西部油田的作用了吧，那可是二十年前就开始调查勘探的。过十几年金属矿产资源紧缺，大洋海底我们占下来的地盘就会发挥作用了。\n\n所谓人无远虑，必有近忧，而所见者远，所图者大的事业，其开端往往是低调了又低调。\n\n咱们开始这些调查的时候，只肯说自己是为了人类的科学事业，谁也不说对我们国家会有什么具体用处。\n\n9  余言\n\n因为各种原因，本系列写不了原定的十一到十二篇了。\n\n南极问题不必再写，是因为我们已经挤进去了，它和海洋权益问题的直接关系，目前也不明显；北部湾问题也不必写，因为这个问题已经成了历史。\n\n中越双方已经达成协议，现在的任务，是要遵守协议，并且赶紧忘记之前的历史，开始新的生活。\n\n所谓“忘记历史就意味着背叛，”这句话并不是什么颠扑不破的真理。\n\n沉浸在对过去荣光的缅怀里，生活在对邻居不义的仇恨记忆里，以意淫为乐，以骂街为能，那是破落贵族和不成气候的遗老遗少们的勾当。我们嘛，还是轻装前进好。\n\n毕竟，我们发表言论并不是为了吃后悔药，也不是为了指责别人，来显示自己的高明。我们写作，呼吁，都是想为将来的斗争出一分力，提供一点思路。\n\n中国的海洋世纪必将到来！前提是我们会建设得越来越好。还是那句老话，闭关锁国的中国不需要海洋，贫穷落后的中国不需要海洋。我希望，我们的商船奔忙在各个大洋上，而海军，只是为了保卫他们而航行。\n\n今年是郑和下西洋600周年，国内多半又要张罗着庆祝，可是，像郑和那样劳民伤财，游行了一圈又一圈，除了炫耀我天朝富强，对国民的帮助到底有什么呢？\n\n所以，我们还是先去做海洋生意、去开发海洋矿藏吧，等到有了广泛丰厚的海上利益，海军才有合理的用武之地。\n\n海洋权益，除了资源的占有，更重要的，是权利，是各种各样的可能性。\n\n作为一个大国，其利益必然遍及全球。占有其实是次要的，影响才是主要的。站在喜马拉雅山顶看世界，今后20年的海洋权益上，通道高于一切！\n\n除了前文说过的图们江出海口，可以让我们通向日本海以外，在未来，我的看法，我们必将会：\n\n—穿越克拉地峡，从泰国直趋暹罗湾；\n\n—铺设输油管，建设高速公路或者铁路，联通巴基斯坦，并加速建设在巴基斯坦的港口；\n\n—设法从西藏或云南出孟加拉湾。\n\n这是直下印度洋的世纪雄心，做得好了，我们完全可能成为一个真正的大洋国家。\n\n图片\n\n10  稳扎稳打\n\n作为一个大国，中国在南海的岛屿争端问题上，目前基本上就是步步为营、稳扎稳打。\n\n由于双方巨大且越拉越大的实力差，网友对这一点也是越来越不满，认为太软弱。其实这种软弱的根源，在于南沙群岛的特殊性。\n\n如果越、马、菲任何一国因为历史原因窃取台湾岛。可以相信我，中国早就把它们办了，有一百次办一百次，绝不会这么墨迹。\n\n虽然同样是岛，南沙这些弹丸小岛可不是台湾岛。有几个勉强能修机场，可机场和机场就一样吗？有几个能建港口，可是港口和港口就一样吗？\n\n南海群岛中除了极少数几个统统没有足够的自持力，就算有4000米跑道机场、有万吨级港口，还是不足以充当一个完整意义上的前进基地（比如关岛、冲绳）。\n\n真的看一眼这些“岛”的照片，就明白这地方只能交替控制，谁到了谁“控制”一会，“控制”完了然后就得赶紧走，这鬼地方连支个帐篷都没空间，再晚走就赶不上2路汽车了。\n\n为了把最近南海发生的事儿说清楚，还是得先有张图，重新发一张图。\n\n图片\n\n图为3月29日，搭乘渔船的菲律宾军队在南海仁爱礁附近，与中国海警船发生激烈对峙。\n\n比起十多年前开始在网上流行的那张图，大家可以看到中国控制的岛礁多了很多，主要是依托美济礁为基地控制周边的牛鈪礁、安达礁、三角礁、五方礁、仁爱礁、信义礁、半月礁、仙娥礁、仙宾礁、半日礁、北恒礁、孔明礁诸岛礁。\n\n依托渚碧礁为基地控制西月岛、马欢岛、费信岛、南钥岛、北子岛、双黄沙洲、杨信沙洲等道明、郑和群礁岛礁。\n\n依托东门礁为基地控制库归礁、安乐礁、西门礁、舰长礁等九章群礁礁石。\n\n从地图上可以看出，这些年挤占的岛礁，绝大多数都是被菲律宾非法侵占的，这也就是为什么中菲近年来一直交恶的原因之一。\n\n看到了这里，大家应该对中国经营南海的套路有个了解了吧？那么，为什么最近几天中越冲突突然成为了主角也就不足为奇了。\n\n由于中日、中菲的主权争端占据了媒体的眼球，不少人对中越南海争端突然激化有些摸不着头脑。\n\n其实这场规模空前的摩擦，是中国长期维护海上权益手段的集中展现，也就是类似于三十六计中的“明修栈道、暗度陈仓”。\n\n为什么这样说？\n\n近段时间，越南成了中国媒体上曝光率奇高的一个国家。先是推掉了亚运会，引得国内一阵“务实不求虚荣”、“深藏功与名”的吹捧。\n\n接着他们又举办了一次“表彰军队经商有功”的大会，虽然国内媒体报道不多，但光是这名字就足以让国人惊掉下巴。\n\n而最近，越南出动大批执法船只，骚扰在中国专属经济区进行钻探作业的“海洋石油981”钻井平台，进而与我国海警发生冲突。\n\n中国外交部门严正声明，我国在事发海域只有无武装的民船，越方主动碰撞我方多达171次。\n\n有人习惯于“反思”中国“软弱”的南海政策，怒斥克制政策是“丧权辱国”。我就此实在没什么好多说，只想说，事后越南方面召开发布会，并公布了“中国采取强硬措施”的视频。\n\n这段视频在网络上流传甚广，如有兴趣，读者不妨自己搜索之，看后相信大家自有判断。 从现场视频来看，我们可以发现这次争端与过去有显著不同。\n\n中国出动了大批吨位不超过1000吨的中小型海警船。据越南方面称，在冲突开始的时候，中国在现场有80艘船，而越南为70艘。\n\n从这一点，我们可以看出在南沙、西沙维权方面中国取得了一个突破性的进展，一举夺得了主动权。\n\n此次对抗中，出镜最多的是我国618B型海警巡逻艇，该艇航速25节，机动性好，非常适合对越南小型舰艇进行驱逐甚至碰撞。但该艇651吨的排水量对于远海航行略嫌不足。\n\n如果从我国大陆沿海港口出发，往往会因为油料、给养的原因，无法持久执行任务，因此在此前的南海维权中，该型艇主要执行较近的北部湾海域巡逻。\n\n事实上，在南海争端中，越南所凭借的主要优势是冲突海域离越南本土近。以往，我国在西沙附近同时在场的可能只有几艘大吨位海警船，越南则可以派遣大批小型船只持续施加压力。\n\n这种两拳难敌四手的窘境在西沙存在，在南沙则更加严重，一度成为我国海洋维权的难点。为了应付这一问题，此前曾有建造海军低配置巡逻舰的设想。\n\n中国大批建造的千吨级海监船也多少有这种考虑，但一方面大舰的运行成本更高，长期使用不甚经济，二来大船的机动性较差，面对越南灵活的小船，反而有些难以下手。\n\n图片\n\n上图为永兴岛照片，停机坪已经基本填出，跑道也在不断延长，直到礁盘的尽头。\n\n中国使用的是更加一劳永逸的方法。\n\n过去一年间，越南网站上就开始出现大量视频图像资料，显示中国正在西沙永兴岛大兴土木，将永兴岛锚地进行大规模的疏浚扩建，使之可以支持大型舰艇直接停泊。\n\n从中方的资料可以看出，2012年以来，三沙市正在规划建设项目14个，总投资约219亿元。\n\n包括西沙公路、西沙晋卿岛综合补给基地码头、文昌清澜港码头三沙后勤补给及交通专用码头、永兴岛综合码头一期工程及二期项目、西沙群岛岛际交通设施项目、南海捕捞船队、北礁旅游和保护等建设项目。\n\n这种把军事项目混在民用项目中一揽子进行是中国政府常用的手法。可以说，中方之所以能够在短时间内集结起相当数量的执法船，是中国政府近年来不惜血本进行南海战场建设的成果。\n\n以永兴岛为代表的西沙基地群的支持下，我方的执法船队完全可以如在近海一样活动，一举夺回主动权。我方可充分发挥执法船船龄新，主机动力强大，航速快，双层耐撞结构设计等方面的优势。\n\n虽然建设岛礁基地网看似初期投入成本十分高昂，但相比南海开发的巨大收益，完全是合算的。\n\n那么选择这个时间点把981移到中建盆地采油，仅仅是因为越南刚刚请人探测出这里有大型油气田？于是，另一则消息进入了我的视野。\n\n近几个月来，中国对原本仅有一座高脚屋的赤瓜礁进行了大规模扩建，中国大型货船不远千里从本土运来钢筋混凝土和砂石，将原本仅有一块礁石露出水面的赤瓜礁硬生生改成了一座小岛，有防波堤、油库、灯塔等港口设施。\n\n这些岛礁上可以存放相当数量的补给物资和燃料，供小吨位执法舰艇停靠、补给、休整甚至抢修。\n\n赤瓜礁水下礁盘长5000米、宽400米，在整个南海海域中基本处在到四周大块陆地的等距离中点，是建立南海前进基地的理想选择。\n\n在这里加强基础设施建设，将明显增加中国在南沙海域的有效活动半径和快反能力，减轻西沙永兴岛的压力，对以“小陆地、大海洋”为基本特征的三沙市建设具有现实意义，对进一步加强捍卫国家主权能力、掌握南海局势主动权具有战略影响。\n\n中国船队在南沙赤瓜礁进行大规模填海，多艘军舰护卫。可以想见，赤瓜礁上的基础设施建设也将是越南的眼中钉，所以，“主动”在西沙方向“挑起”事端，攻越南之所必救，让越南在两线上顾此失彼，掩护赤瓜礁建设。\n\n一旦赤瓜礁基地建设完成，可以和永暑、华阳、渚碧几个驻军岛礁连成一片，变被动为主动，充分发挥我国舰多、人多、钱多的优势。\n\n将郑和、九章、尹庆诸群礁上的越南据点一个一个拔掉，完全控制南华水道，可以一举扭转中国在南海维权中最大的劣势——距离。\n\n没有了距离这一劣势，中国完全可以把任何觊觎南海的外国淹没在船海中。所以，为什么在西沙方向发动这么大规模的佯攻，就可以理解了。\n\n那么，为什么会是赤瓜礁呢？\n\n南沙的岛礁大大小小有几百个，为什么首先选择赤瓜礁填海开发？这是许多读者关心话题。\n\n那么，下面按照岛礁的面积位置和开发的难易及潜力略作粗浅分析，由于岛和礁的性质不同，不宜一起比较，礁又分为环礁和非环礁。\n\n所以分三类各自比较：\n\n第一类是岛。\n\n第一级肯定是太平岛，中业岛。\n\n这两岛地位难分上下，太平岛是南沙主岛，法律地位至高无尚，象征意义更大，目前在湾湾手中，可以无视。\n\n中业岛的位置更好，接近南海航道，且开发潜力远大于太平岛，周围较近的地方有可供开发的中业群礁的礁盘，太平岛很孤立。\n\n第二级的应该是南威岛、马欢岛、北子岛。其余为第三级别的。\n\n第二类是环礁。\n\n第一级的是美济礁、柏礁、东礁。\n\n美济礁地处南沙北部礁群和东北部礁群的结合部，是南华水道以北条件最好的环礁，是南沙北半部天然的中心。柏礁地处南沙南部礁群和西南部礁群的结合部，是南华水道以南条件最好的环礁，是南沙南半部天然的中心。\n\n可以说北美济南柏礁，是整个南沙的两个眼珠子。东礁的建设条件同样好，但位置稍偏，可是它的优点是接近南海航道，更适合作为军事前沿基地，将来在永暑充分开发后可以作为永暑的副手。\n\n所这三个大型环礁地位相当，理所当然是第一级的。第二级的是渚碧礁、司令礁、半月礁、弹丸礁、大现礁、毕生礁、六门礁、南华礁。\n\n渚碧礁、司令礁、半月礁、弹丸礁处于南沙礁群的边缘重要节点上的中型环礁，地位重要，且开发条件都很好。\n\n大现礁位置好，礁坪面积很大，且集中，最适合造陆，但过于狭长，且建机场港口的条件较差，所以只能屈居第二级，将来可作赤瓜岛的后勤基地，搞种养植。\n\n毕生礁六门礁南华礁可看作一体，地处南华水道中部，也是整个南沙的中心，地位同样重要，毕生礁南华礁虽处中央，但为中型环礁，六门礁虽然礁体巨大但礁坪断续，建设条件相比第一级的三礁稍差，所以屈居第二级。\n\n第三类是非环礁。\n\n这类礁体总面积没有环礁大，但大多礁坪较宽，有的接近方形，更适合填海造陆，但远期潜力较小，尤其是不易建大型港口。\n\n第一级的是永暑礁、赤瓜礁。\n\n永暑礁主礁坪四平方公里，走向适合建机场，地处南海航道和南华水道的丁字路口，战略地位突出，且有远期开发北部几十平方公里水下礁盘的潜力，军事地位无可撼动，从长期看永暑就是南海的定海神针。\n\n赤瓜礁是非环礁中目前面积最大条件最好的，地处中央，有一个不大不小的内湖，且有九章群礁拱卫。这两礁地位不差上下，且和环礁中的第一级地位也相当。\n\n第二级是面积较大位置较重要的，如南通礁、琼台礁、双子群礁中的贡士礁、罗奈礁、华阳礁、东门礁等等。不再一一细说。其余为第三级。\n\n如果要把这三类中的第一级放在一起进行综合比较的话就难了，仁者见仁智者见智。\n\n太平岛、中业岛、美济礁、柏礁、东礁、永暑礁、赤瓜礁共七个。在不同时期可能重要性有所不同。\n\n我个人认为，目前赤瓜当属首选。立足南沙全局，结合近中远期南沙岛礁的开发和建设，不可能全面开花。要抓住要点，就全局考虑。\n\n赤瓜礁无论论近期还是远期，都应是南沙的军事和行政中心，近期造陆一平方公里，建大型机场港口，能驻大型两栖战舰，如071一艘、潜艇两艘、054一艘、056两艘，远期全面建设永暑为军事副中心。\n\n赤瓜、永暑、美济、柏礁，这四个最重要的战略要地，其实我国已控制三个，完全大有可为。将来再建柏礁也不迟，其余岛礁，敌人也只是象征性的占领，晚些收回也没什么大不了的。\n\n只要建好现有的永暑、赤瓜、美济三个战略要地，不断加强实力的存在，对敌人围而不打，南沙问题终会解决。\n\n南沙问题解决的快慢完全取决于中国对以上三个战略要地的建设速度的快慢。可以这样说，我们能建多快南沙问题就能解决多快。\n\n如果能按以上设想，在近几年内建成以上军事行政经济中心，其它敌占岛礁的存在已无太大意义。\n\n看中国在南海如何一步一个脚印狠得不能再狠解决一个一个的问题，非常重要的一点就是如何把问题串起来解决。第一个为第二个打下伏笔，第二个为第三个创造条件。\n\n1、在越南统一的前夕，1974年，西沙海战收复西沙群岛。这里离大陆最近，好控制，而且西沙永兴岛面积最大，现在就是三沙市的市政所在地。性价比最高。中国的脚伸到了北纬15°线附近的西边。\n\n2、越南统一，脱离中国，亲近俄罗斯。苏联在金兰湾驻军。80年代驻扎多达二三十艘军舰，控制南海，从南面包围中国，中国隐忍。\n\n3、在东欧风云变幻，苏联解体征兆出现；中越边境战争接近尾声，中越关系正常化近在眼前。当时1988年，制造战机，开打南沙海战；收复永暑礁，华阳礁等6个岛礁；后续建设“高脚屋”，成为中国在南沙的小型前进基地。注意，中国的脚，伸到了北纬9°线附近的西边。\n\n4、日历翻到1995年，美国如日中天。中国在美济礁与小菲对峙。渔政船立功。再有美国撑腰，小菲仍然是腰杆不如嘴巴硬。过了两三年，中国在美济礁修建新一代高脚屋，成为小型前进基地。中国军舰开始在美济礁—半月礁—礼乐滩一带定期巡航。注意，中国的脚伸到了北纬9°线附近的东边。\n\n5、2012年，中国国际地位相对上升不少。故技重施控制黄岩岛。注意，中国的脚伸到了北纬15°线的东边。\n\n至此，中国在九段线里面，北纬9°线以北所有的海域，铺上了自己的垫脚石。\n\n曾母暗沙在北纬4°线，还有5°，这5°里面主要是以南威岛为核心的“南南沙群岛”（越南）和南安礁—南海礁一线（马来），会拿谁先开刀呢？\n\n看看这几个月的新闻，其实已经有答案了。从整个历程来看，可能有人会问，为什么跟越南干了两次，跟小菲一次没干就成了。小菲不是有美国撑腰吗？\n\n不知道大家手上有没有标示了被占据岛屿情况的地图。如果有的话，可以很清晰地看到，南沙西边，越南占了非常多，密密麻麻，几乎能占的都占了。南沙东边，小菲只占了几个。还有大量的空礁。\n\n所以，越南是严阵以待，小菲是漏洞百出。先打最棘手的越南，再留着扶不起的小菲，到了冷战后的和平时期再去挤压小菲也照样有空间。\n\n又回到原来的问题，就是在南海问题上，美国插足，其实也就是小菲这个点上面插足插得厉害。别的国家基本上不认美国作大哥。就算美国势力退出了西太平洋，退出了南海，对中国解决南海问题，作用并不大。\n\n另外一个，要提醒诸位的：现在谁在给越南撑腰？别吃惊啊，嘴巴别张大，俄罗斯是也。\n\n像这种伎俩，恰恰就是8字方针里面后面4个字的应用对象了——有所作为！\n\n1、到中国的南海航线，主要在南海西边。这条航线靠近越南。北段经过西沙，已经被中国控制，南段目前在越南势力范围之内。要不了多久，中国就会动手。\n\n2、深海钻进平台981，国产的哦，已经可以开始干活了。这玩意可是二十多年磨一剑，意义相当大。\n\n南海，中国出了一道题，老美没有上当。\n\n黄岩岛对峙，导演应该是中国，目的是给老美出了一道题，就是让美表态，中国是知道老美会这样表态的。\n\n黄岩岛无论从哪一方面说都是中国的，还故意让小菲去问老美，老美也不能不表态(自认为自已比较公证)也不能说是菲的更不会说属于中国，只有说中立(达到中国的目的了)，以后就好办了，不需要战争(小战斗可能会有，战争可能阻断经济的快速发展)\n\n以后大家会看到，温水煮小狒，煮猴子……也许狒狒发现了水温，要不怎么会乱蹦呢？\n\n个人认为：对于南海，中国的想法就是拖时间。拖到中国的爪子够长的那一天。\n\n而那些一衣带水的正相反。趁爸爸国还靠得住，能分一口是一口。所以中国、菲佣的行为就不难理解了。\n\n中国一直要大事化小，捞点鱼、罚点钱是小事，主权是我的到时候都是我的，隔海相望的则是要造成即成事实我一直在这经营管理，理法上我要分一口不为过。\n\n对于中国来说，一切尽在掌握！看吧，菲佣最近几年要吃大亏！菲佣才是真真的250，拉世界列强来搅局。亲，和平发展，我们要和平发展。\n\n不管对老美来说还是对中国来说，菲律宾都是小事。不论美国是否表态，一旦中菲开战，美都不会参战，而是搞代理人战争。所以美国表态与否其实都一样。\n\n大国一般有几个面目，比如装X、原形毕露……现在美国就选择了前者，搞代理人战争，也是翻脸的一种，在表面上也是明显对立的。\n\n中国支援越南就是代理人战争，卖给利比亚武器被活捉就是装X露馅。\n\n区别太大了。\n\n老美重返亚太，其方法是鼓动那些与中国有领土纠纷的小国对抗中国，它自己躲在幕后。\n\n中国上次与菲对峙，绝不退让，意图也非常明显：你美国既然重返亚太，想来把水搅浑，那好，我先来搅浑，看你如何收场。\n\n如果你坚决站在小国一方来对抗中国，那好，我就来个强硬主张，反正这些地方迟早得用强硬的方法，损失本就难免，你不怕损失，你来吧，看谁玩的起！\n\n如果你表态中立，那么，你的重返亚太作用便难达预期，让南海诸国看明白了，你只不过是在边上教唆而已，一旦动真格的，你就缩回去了！\n\n对了，法国在叙利亚也是这样的情况，西方吵吵着要改天换地，中俄不肯，这时西方也选择了装B，暗地里派人、运武器，外籍军团不是被抓了么？法国人最后还得矜持一番。\n\n其实在南海，中国太厉害了。\n\n离中国太远了……离菲律宾和越南比较近……\n\n这不是远近的问题，地球上的资源越来越少，人越来越多，说白了就是谁牛逼谁占得多谁的生存空间就大，谁就能笑到最后。这世界就是这样，弱肉强食，现在不争，以后就晚了。\n\n再说了，南海于中国，意味着什么？不拿下南海，谈何崛起？谈何发展？不拿下南海中国的海军永远走不出去，南海必须是中国的！就算是想尽一切办法，也要把南海搞到手！\n\n何况南海本来就是中国的地盘。中国以前的渔政船比别人的军舰大一号，也就中国腹黑，把它叫渔政船。据说中国接下来要大造056，替下来的护卫舰都做公务船，这叫和平崛起，别让菲佣受惊了。\n\n这是跟日本学的，当年咱们跟鬼子发生海上纠纷的时候，咱们出的是海军的炮艇或者老式护卫舰（那时候穷，没啥大家伙），鬼子出的可是海上警视厅的巡逻船，结果人家的船大、马力足、设备先进，纠缠起来就像黄岩岛咱们的渔政船干菲律宾“最大军舰”一样。\n\n咱们又不能开炮打，冲撞追逐还干不过人家，人家最后还落了个爱好和平，用的是民用船，别人嚼舌头的时候还都说咱们不是，动不动就上海军，太好战。\n\n于是咱们学乖了，也来这一手了，我的船再大再强也是民用船，你的舰再破再烂也是军舰，我把你堵的没脾气也是你军舰欺负了我民用船，实质的便宜占了，嘴皮子上的便宜也不能少。\n\n“现在不划拉中国几块土地，不占中国几座山，不抢中国个把岛屿，不劫持中国几艘渔船，都不好意思说跟中国是邻居”\n\n别着急，一个一个来，别说是中业岛，所有叫越南、菲律宾、马来西亚等占据的岛都要去的。连太平岛、金门岛、马祖岛、东沙、澎湖，甚至台湾都要去转转的。\n\n派公务船，就是警察叔叔，这地撑死了就是一个治安不好；派海军，那就是有叛乱有反动了，性质不一样。反正现在打得过，派啥不一样……你见过俩小偷要出动军方的么？大家的年纪还能等到辽宁舰退役改装成公务船的。\n\n什么叫主权归我，共同开发？看看所谓的礼乐滩在菲佣什么地方就知道。离开巴拉望岛148公里（90海里）的地方叫有争议地区？\n\n那是巴巴的在200海里专属经济区里的吧？可怜的佣人一无技术，二无资金（国际财团已被吓走，佣人的国际招标至今无人投标啊），三无军事，四无国际支持的条件下只能放风，菲佣愿意就礼乐滩共同开发和中国谈判。\n\n亲，还想怎么想？\n\n这不叫完胜？\n\n海南渔业航母，3.2万吨级渔业综合船队已经下水，配套也完成，而渔业航母的下水，将彻底改变南海渔民小舢板往返作业的低效率传统方式，届时大船队带领几百上千的小渔船集团式作业将成为常态，现在已经是了。\n\n查查海南渔业发展规划就知道，南海渔业资源估计280万吨，而到2015年，预计海南要实现220万吨。这就是网传的——打别人的鱼，让别人无鱼可打。\n\n南海大部分礁石是无法驻军和住人开发，而国际上对领土的确认很大的一部分就是看能否有效开发？\n\n有了981们，和3.2万吨级的渔业船队长期作业就是实际占有，开打，把佣人的二艘破挺炸沉，然后又回航，形成不了实际占有，于事无补，又难免留下倚强凌弱的口实。爱和平的中国怎么会干呢？\n\n西沙早就发展了海洋养殖业，（浩瀚南海养鱼好像比打渔成本高很多吧），西沙的旅游也开通了。鸭子划水时的更会带来一个有一个惊喜的。\n\n上次中国挑了一个国际上普遍没有争议的黄岩岛挑起争端，阿基诺和美国积极配合，实在不是老美和菲佣不聪明而是中国太厉害啊。\n\n摆平菲律宾，就形成了黄岩岛模式，越南的近海也就采不出多少油了，怎么办？只能和中国合作啊。再过10年8年，只要脑子里不进水的人就知道，南海还有人会来抢占吗？\n\n大国的作为，实在不是喊打喊杀能够落实的。近来有人对中国进行围殴，似乎蚂蚁挥舞大棒，大象实在不该“怯弱”，可大部分人都忽略了，大象对蚂蚁动武不动武都不能与勇敢和怯弱挂钩，只体现智慧和策略。\n\n不战而屈人之兵对中国最有利！因为中国的实力摆在那里呢！任何国家和人都不会无利拼命起早的，如今油是重点，渔业是实利。\n\n一直觉得事情没这么简单，中国怎么肯吃亏，让菲佣在头上拉屎。哪天中国和老美要是到了实力接近的时候，老美也会被玩没有商量。\n所以，悠悠万事，发展为大，不可不察。",

"咸丰六年，太平军攻破江南大营，进入全盛时期。是年太平都城天京发生变乱，天王自相残杀，杨秀清帐下女将杨季英于天京外驻守时得知统帅杨秀清被杀，自知在劫难逃，思虑再三，最终率亲信部下八百多人叛投清廷，陷入困境的清廷诧异于杨季英此时来投，问明原因后大喜，立即厚赏杨季英，编入湘军，仍任将领职务，望其助朝廷早日平叛逆贼，杨季英深感朝廷恩赏，屡立战功，在军中声望渐起，杨季英长相貌美，风姿绰约，体态丰腴凹凸有致，为军中添上一笔靓丽风景，引起不少人仰慕。\n\n但其实清朝廷对杨季英并不放心，厚赏封将也只是为了昭示朝廷的宽容大度，以便日后招降。被编入湘军时杨季英身边八百多人都被打散编入其它军队，留在杨季英身边的只有区区二十多名女部，其帐下士卒也不过三四百人。任职以来，杨季英虽然战功卓越，但职位却迟迟难以高升，始终在中低将领间徘徊，不过杨季英倒没有怨言，毕竟自己曾以叛贼身份来降朝廷，朝廷能不计前嫌任用自己便已十分感激，总的来说杨季英在军中的待遇还算不错。不过好日子很快就到头了。由于湘军久攻安庆不克，朝廷更换了都统，新都统张廷范生性阴损毒辣，对朝廷奖赏太平降将以招安的政策很不满，自然对杨季英是处处刁难。\n\n一日清晨，都统军帐内三军议事，众将皆列坐帐内，杨季英也在其间。根据探子回报，目前太平将领陈玉成正率大军回援安庆，将至集贤关，湘军面临是战是守的难题，众将一时间议论纷纷，莫衷一是。这时一位将领说道：“依末将看，我军应该立即前往关口、毛岭一带设伏，于逆贼援军途中截击，定能大溃贼军。”众将听后连连称是，好大喜功的张廷范原计划也是如此，他想要在淮军来援之前立下奇功，为自己以后的仕途铺平道路。\n\n就在众将异口同声的请战之时，杨季英却眉头紧蹙说道：“末将认为不可贸然出击，我军粮草充沛，辎重尚多，应该占据贼军增援安庆的必经险关，以逸待劳，更为稳妥。”\n\n此言一出，立即招来一些好大喜功的将领的反驳，毕竟太平军还能撑多久谁也不知道，他们不想放弃这次升官发财的机会，纷纷坚持出击的提议。张廷范内心算盘打得清楚，故意露出对杨季英提议不满的神色，看到都统面露愠色，其他几位赞成杨季英提议的将领也不敢发表意见，见杨季英被众将孤立，张廷范感觉时机已到。\n\n只见张廷范突然怒道：“大胆杨季英！现在大战将至，众将出战决心已定，你却屡屡阻挠，扰乱军心，依我看你是畏敌不前，该当何罪！”杨季英听闻脸色瞬变，万万想不到事态会成这样，连忙解释道：“末将绝无畏敌之意啊！只是事关重大，还望从长计议啊！”\n\n“够了！我看你是‘身在曹营心在汉’，心里还挂念着太平军逆贼吧！不惩治惩治你怎么对得起浴血奋斗的众将士？传我军令，将女将杨季英褫衣，重打二十军棍！”\n\n“都统冤枉我也！望都统明鉴！”杨季英不假思索，字字铿锵辩解道。\n\n“还敢狡辩！给我再加二十，改打四十军棍！看看是你嘴硬还是这军棍硬！”\n\n杨季英见张廷范如此无理取闹，恨得咬牙切齿，心中暗暗直骂。但知军令如山，自己一个将领万不可顶撞都统，便不再多言，但转念想到自己一介女将，竟要当着那么多男将裸臀受打，实在羞耻难忍，想到这不禁面泛红晕，僵立良久。\n\n见杨季英迟迟不肯脱衣，张廷范说道：“怎么，杨将军是嫌四十军棍不够受用吗？”\n\n听到张廷范的阴阳怪气，杨季英知道事情已经没得缓和的余地了，内心不禁苦笑，但事已至此，也由不得自己了，只好狠狠心把战甲脱了下来，只剩白色亵衣。杨季英生的细腰丰臀，胸前巨乳撑圆衣领半露在外，细腰间亵衣松松垮垮，臀部的亵衣又被饱满肉臀撑的平坦紧致，透出胴体的肉色，满座皆惊于杨季英的姿色，没想到英姿飒爽的女将杨季英脱下战甲，身材竟如此标致火辣。在众将惊喜的目光下，杨季英无奈把亵裤也脱去......\n\n亵裤从肉腿上滑落，丰满浑圆的大屁股从裤中弹出，众将看到无不啧啧称奇。由于常年锻炼，杨季英的屁股跟宫中娇生惯养的贵妃不同，厚实饱满的臀肉夹着幽深的臀沟，荫毛乌黑亮丽，两片肥厚的荫唇紧紧的夹在大腿中间，众将炽热的目光让杨季英羞愧难当，双脚偷偷内扣，夹紧洁白肉腿，军帐中一时间充满了女人胴体的芳香，引得帐外站岗军士纷纷侧目。\n\n几名士卒搬来一条长凳和几根粗麻绳，还有两根军棍，军棍长一米二，宽四指，厚两指，桦木料结实沉重，看着威严粗实的军棍，满座连同杨季英在内都知道今天屁股要遭大罪了。杨季英在众人目光下趴到了长凳上，几名士卒拿来麻绳将她两条胳膊朝下跟凳子腿绑在一起，又把她的腰部和小腿捆在长凳上，浑圆的大白屁股无助的撅着，两名壮实的士卒手握军棍站在杨季英的两侧，等候行刑的指令。\n\n随着张廷范一声命令，两名士卒举起军棍，朝杨季英的屁股打去，寂静的帐内霎间响起急促的军棍声，‘啪啪’震耳，军棍打在杨季英的肉臀上，饱满的屁股被打的凹陷弹起，掀起阵阵肉浪，杨季英咬紧牙关，只吭哧了几声，四五军棍下去，臀肉青紫肿胀，杨季英受不住了，失声叫喊起来，士卒不为所动，军棍继续打在臀上，啪啪啪啪...二十军棍打完，杨季英滚烫的肉臀竟肿起两指多高，臀峰肉最厚的地方的皮发白起皱，皮下臀肉充血紫红，渗出沥沥血珠。\n\n行刑过半，按律当由都统验刑。\n\n张廷范走到杨季英身旁，看了看屁股不太满意，问道：“怎么打了二十军棍还不流血？”\n\n士卒吓的连忙解释：“都统大人有所不知，这女将的臀肉比男将更加柔软，军棍陷进肉中便会卸力三分，威力自然大打折扣，所以看似柔弱的女将却往往比刚健的男将耐力更佳，不过即使这样，看杨将军的屁股，再打几棍也定会皮开肉绽的。”\n\n张廷范这才点点头，难怪杨季英屁股肿了那么高，然后摆摆手示意继续。\n\n就在两名士卒举起军棍的时候，两名杨季英的女部下林婉儿和秦冰凤闯入军帐中，跪在地上替杨季英求情，张廷范心里暗道来的正好，立即勃然大怒吼道：“大胆！区区两名副官竟敢硬闯军帐，目无军纪！给我拿下，各打二十军棍以儆效尤！”话音刚落，几名士卒冲上去将林婉儿与秦冰凤按住，杨季英一看，不忍部下因自己受刑，强忍疼痛连忙说道：“这两个黄毛丫头不知天高地厚，冲撞了都统，是末将平时疏于管教所致，还请都统开恩，我愿意代她二人受罚！”\n\n张廷范心中大喜，连忙一口答应，不等林、秦二人说话，便命士卒将二人轰出军帐并关上大门，再不许任何人进入军帐。转过头来张廷范宣布：“杨季英本剩二十军棍，但因刚才之事，杨季英执意要替部下受罚，二人各二十军棍共四十军棍，加上所剩二十军棍，一共六十军棍，必须棍棍见血，胆敢徇私，军法处置！开始吧。”\n\n“遵命！”两名士卒听到军法处置，不敢怠慢，立刻使出全身力气朝杨季英的屁股打去，只听惊雷般一声‘呼...啪！’，只一棍下去，杨季英两片肉臀上皱硬的白皮竟被军棍连根带起，破皮的肉臀瞬间皮开肉绽，被渗出的鲜血染红，杨季英措手不及，瞬间青筋暴起，哇的一声惨叫起来，行刑士卒见怪不怪，卯足力气，呼啸急促的军棍打在血臀上，滋味可想而知......没几下杨季英就受不住拼命扭动屁股，疯了似的嗷嗷直叫，秀发飞舞，军棍却紊丝不乱，臀上血檩越来越大，飞溅的鲜血染红了军棍，杨季英疼的直发抖，扭动的血臀带动长凳也咯吱作响，一时间杨季英的惨叫与军棍声回荡在军帐内外，甚是惨烈。\n\n六十军棍打完，杨季英嘴唇发白瘫软在长凳上，全身湿透，帐中汗香弥漫，肉臀血肉模糊，肉丘上隆起两块碗大的血檩，足足肿起了三指多高，散发着滚滚热浪，加上杨季英一身细腻白肉相衬，甚是销魂，一些将领竟忍不住博起，张廷范也暗暗称美。\n\n两边士卒站开，张廷范下来验刑，杨季英羞恨交加，低头不语，乌黑秀发掩盖着面庞，多了几分凄美。张廷范说：“看来是这六十军棍打的不够，杨将军一点悔恨之意都没有啊，这样吧，传我军令，加打五十皮板。”\n\n杨季英心里暗暗叫苦，但自尊心甚强的她还是选择了坚持，她抿抿嘴，仍不求饶。\n\n所谓皮板，就是用两层牛皮制成的宽皮带，一尺多长，两寸多宽，又糙又硬。两名士卒取来四根皮板，又端来一口煮着开水的热锅，下面柴火还在烧，水咕噜咕噜的沸腾着，只见两名士卒把皮板全部搭载锅上，皮带的大部分都浸入了沸水中煮，众将不解，士卒趁煮皮带的片刻解释道：“把皮板放进沸水煮，是为了让皮板吸水变重。”\n\n待皮板变软，两名士卒一人拿起一根，朝着杨季英的血臀打去。只听‘啪啪啪啪’的抽打声，皮板结结实实打在杨季英臀上，掀起一阵阵肉浪。莫要小看这一尺多长的皮板，打在肉上疼的很，更何况打在皮开肉绽的臀肉上，仿佛用铁刷子刮肉一般疼，甚至超过军棍。杨季英杀猪似的哀嚎起来，一个劲的狂叫‘疼死我了！莫要再打！’，士卒不予理睬，继续抽打，其他将领虽然没尝过这皮板的滋味，但看杨季英的样子也知道不好受。士卒每打几下便把皮板放回锅中换另外两根继续打，如此交替，是为了保持皮板的韧性跟温度，滚烫的皮板刺激皮肤，使得疼痛放大，不停抽打又使疼痛不断翻倍，果然杨季英越叫越凄厉，肉臀甩动不止，疼的欲生欲死，张廷范在一旁催促‘快打’。\n\n五十皮板打完，杨季英声音沙哑，面无血色，臀部黑紫，血檩扩大了一圈，锅中沸水也已经变成了红色。\n\n“现在你可知罪？”张廷范直接了当的问道。\n\n杨季英仍坚持替自己辩解，场面一时又陷入僵局。张廷范自然不怕杨季英嘴硬，他有的是办法，于是故作怒道：“好你个杨季英，还敢嘴硬，传我军令，把杨季英翻过来，再给我追加三十马鞭！一定要重重的打！”\n\n两名士卒眼珠一转便领会了都统的意思，相互使了个眼神，突然以迅雷不及掩耳的速度将杨季英架起，杨继英被士卒仰面朝天摔到凳上，血臀撞在凳上，发出一声惨叫。不容杨季英反应，士卒拿起麻绳把杨季英的腰腹绑在长凳上，胳膊反绑在凳子腿上，除了两条腿外杨季英是动弹不得，就在她疑惑之时，两名士卒一左一右抱起杨季英肉腿向两边分开，杨季英惊呼挣扎无济于事，一名士卒取来马鞭走到杨季英分开的腿前，杨季英这才反应过来，惊呼“不要啊！”，“给我打！” 张廷范一声令下，士卒举起马鞭朝杨季英的羞处打去，韧劲十足的鞭梢打在女人最娇弱的肉上，滋味可想而知。马鞭飞速抽打在杨季英的荫唇上，鞭鞭见血，荫唇以肉眼可见的速度充血肿胀，众将看的兴起，竟无一人求情。杨季英发疯似的狂叫不止，拼命夹合双腿，大腿白肉乱颤，奈何双腿难敌四手，任她怎么挣扎也合不上腿。鞭子不断抽打在嫩肉上，杨季英疼的抓狂，羞处抽搐间竟然失禁，肉缝突然张开，尿液喷灌而出，杨季英面红耳赤，持鞭士卒眼疾手快，竟狠狠朝正在喷尿的肉缝抽去，鞭子擦在肉缝里侧嫩肉上，其疼痛难以想象，只见杨季英惨叫一声，昏死过去，士卒用水泼醒杨季英，继续抽打。 三十马鞭打完，杨季英双腿被放下，从荫阜到荫道口遍布血痕，两片荫唇肿胀渗血，荫蒂如葡萄一般，惨不忍睹，杨季英羞痛难忍，仰天痛哭。虽然心中愤懑不平，但眼下人为刀俎我为鱼肉，自己再也不堪折磨，只好屈辱认罪。 张廷范见杨季英认罪，微微一笑，说道：“既然杨将军知罪了，本都统自然不再追究，这样吧，传我军令把杨季英吊于账内大梁四个时辰，令其好好思过。”\n\n杨季英暗暗叫苦，但也只得谢过都统。就这样女将杨季英下身赤.裸，被吊在大梁下整整四个时辰，供过路将士引以为戒，一时间门庭若市，直到晚上戌时才被解下。杨季英被部下扶回到帐中，坐立不得，只能趴在床上，部下为其洗臀上药，疼的嗷嗷直叫。\n\n夜里林婉儿跟秦冰凤来到杨季英帐中哭泣，后悔白天害杨季英加了刑，杨季英安慰她们。这时林婉儿跟秦冰凤劝杨季英早日逃离清军，张廷范绝非善类，迟早要对杨将军动手，并表示愿意始终跟随杨将军。杨季英怒斥二人，称自己绝不能再背叛朝廷，她相信朝廷不会负她，毕竟自己也为朝廷立下了汗马功劳，今日之事只当是自己一时冲动，以后小心谨慎些便是，三人彼此安慰，宛如姐妹一般。\n\n杨季英正在帐中休养，身着亵衣趴在床上，亵裤褪在膝盖，裸.露着结着痂的白臀，虽隔几日但屁股仍然隐隐作痛，再加上夏日炎热，屁股又痒又蛰，着实难受。湘军四日后就要开拔，截击陈玉成的太平军，杨季英也要上战场，所以趁着这四日，杨季英想尽快养伤，不然等到湘军开拔，免不了骑马跋涉，到时屁股伤势未愈，免不了吃苦头。\n\n就在杨季英安心养伤的时候，突然帐外传来一阵嘈杂。\n\n“站住，来者何人？”帐前女部问道，只见帐门口来了两名士卒，手持军令，其中一名士卒还拎着两根三尺多长的红漆木棍，一头圆，一头扁。\n\n“我们是奉了张都统之命，前来办事的。识相的赶紧让开！”为首的一个胡子拉碴的肥胖士卒嚷嚷道，飞扬跋扈，仗着军令在身，丝毫没有把两位女部放在眼里。\n\n“大胆！这里是杨将军的军帐，不得无礼！”\n\n“你又非杨将军，黄毛丫头叫唤作甚？再敢阻拦我便上报张都统，把你治罪！”\n\n“不得无礼，让他们进来吧。”眼看帐外就要剑拔弩张，杨季英怕事情闹大，及时制止，穿上亵裤，勉强忍痛坐了起来。\n\n两名士卒小人得志一般，大摇大摆的进入了杨季英的军帐，两名女部也紧紧跟随进来。\n\n到了杨季英面前，抱着红棍的士卒把棍往地上一放。\n\n杨季英不明所以，问道：“这是？”\n\n持军令的肥士卒不慌不慢拿起军令，宣读起来：“奉张都统军令，因女将杨季英前几日于军帐中顶撞都统，军规之罚已受，但军威之损难复，鉴于其军中恶劣影响，有损湘军威严，故要追加军法，以儆效尤。经过斟酌，决定在今天和未来四日，杨季英将军每天午时都要领二十军棍，五日军棍共计一百。杨将军有何疑虑吗？”\n\n“岂有此理！太过分了！”两名女部没等杨季英说话就先鸣不平，说要找张都统说理，杨季英眉头紧蹙，心里暗骂张廷范不是东西，却也无可奈何，现在去找张廷范说理不是自讨更多苦吃吗？\n\n女部和士卒吵吵起来，场面再度紧张，杨季英顾全大局，最终选择妥协，她厉声道：“不要吵了！既然是军令，我自然会遵守。”\n\n“可是杨季军您的屁股...”女部担忧道。\n\n“够了！我自己心里有数，不用多嘴，你们退下吧！”在杨季英的喝令下，两名女部叹了声气，无可奈何的退出了军帐，只剩下杨季英和两名士卒。\n\n“那就得罪杨将军了。”持令士卒笑眯眯的说道。\n\n“不必多言，开始吧。”杨季英抿抿嘴咬牙说道。\n\n两名士卒把一条长凳抬到了帐中间，杨季英强忍着奇耻大辱，趴到了凳上，士卒又取来绳子将杨季英绑好，随后胖士卒一把粗暴的将杨季英的亵裤扒到膝盖，带着疤痕的白臀一下弹了出来，臀上的肌肤与汗毛清晰可见，臀峰上横布着板花，板花周围的肉泛着红色，只有硕臀周围的肉白的如象牙一般，后庭花若隐若现，别有一番风韵，两名士卒大饱眼福，露出猥琐的笑容，门外的两位女部替杨季英担忧着。\n\n两名士卒各持一棍站在杨季英左右，手握红棍圆端，用扁端打屁股。眼馋归眼馋，但两名士卒一点也不会怜香惜玉，也不敢徇私枉法，尤其是刚才跟杨季英的女部发生了争执，要将这欲火跟怒火一并发泄到杨季英的玉臀上。\n\n二人抡圆了红棍，臂、腰、腿一并发力，朝杨季英的屁股打去。红棍威力十足，裹着呼啸的风声，‘啪！’的狠狠击打在杨季英的臀峰，玉臀猛的凹陷下去，又猛的弹起，臀肉翻飞，臀上的疤痕瞬间裂开，渗出鲜血，杨季英剧痛难忍，哇的惨叫起来，门外的女部听到后更是急的直跺脚，又气又忧。\n\n士卒毫不留情，没等杨季英缓过来，另一名士卒也抡圆了红棍打来，结结实实落在杨季英的屁股上，疼的杨季英直夹屁股，忍不住颤抖起来，第三棍、第四棍......一下又一下急促的落下，只听得‘啪！啪！啪！’的巨响，杨季英的屁股旧伤尽裂，在红棍的肆虐下臀肉翻滚，肉浪不断，杨季英惨叫不止，扭动着柳腰跟屁股，但无奈被绑的结结实实，动也动不得，只得老老实实挨棍，棍声、惨叫声糅杂在一起，帐外女部心急如焚，抱头哭泣。\n\n二十下军棍打完，杨季英的屁股皮开肉绽，肿起两块深紫色的大肉檩，甚是骇人，屁股上的疤全都裂开了，渗出的鲜血染红了整个屁股，红棍上粘着许多碎皮、碎疤，往下滴着血。\n\n杨季英面色惨白，喘着粗气，总算是熬过了军棍，但想到后面每日都要再挨上二十军棍，旧伤未愈，又添新伤，苦不堪言。4

H\n\n“今天的军棍打完了，我等要回去复命了，杨将军告辞了。”两名士卒相视一笑，对杨季英做了个揖。\n\n未来四日，杨季英每日午时都要在帐内褫衣挨二十军棍，直到第五日出征为止，着实苦不堪言。\n\n待到第五日出征，杨季英的屁股已是伤痕累累，穿上铠甲，骑上马，一路上颠簸摩擦，更是苦不堪言。\n\n\n---\n\n自湘军与太平军交战已有数月，转眼已经入秋，毛岭一带秋风萧瑟，野草横生，湘军驻扎在安庆城边的山沟，条件十分艰苦，杨季英的硕臀养了小半个月才恢复如初，羞处与屁.眼养了更久，淤紫才褪去，期间还要骑马走动，大腚苦不堪言。在经历的数次苦战后，湘军攻克了安庆西边的清河县，将士们都喜出望外，很快湘军便入驻清河县。\n\n湘军入县，乡民夹道欢迎，清河县令潘安也来迎接，潘县令又矮又肥，眉头一个大痣，生得贼眉鼠眼，太平军占据清河县时他仍为县令，可见其为左右逢源的墙头草，在太平军占领清河县期间，潘县令没少帮太平军做事，搜刮粮草手到擒来，常常把交不上粮的农户家里的年轻女人抓去‘催税’，晚一天交粮，五十小竹条，屁股必定要开花，再不交，扒光衣服打板子，等到屁股皮开肉绽受不住了，再翻过来，腿分开系到俩木桩上，用三指宽的皮宽条抽蛤肉，羞处两块大肉瓣抽的血肿脓紫，哪个女人受得住？个个叫的惨绝人寰，家里人不忍心，借粮也得交，要是这样都不交，那就示众打。太平军期间只有两三户被示众。\n\n其中一户陈家还是母女一起被示众，女人三十多岁，女儿十五六岁，家里男人去远亲家借粮还没回来，母女被潘县令惦记上了，交粮的日子刚一过就急着把母女抓走，扒了衣服一起打，竹条、板子、皮宽条都上了，疼的俩人光腚直颤，站都站不起来。最后让母女光着身子趴在县菜市口架子上示众，烂腚撅高，衙役拿长马鞭、藤棍在后面，半个时辰抽三十下，让来往的人好好瞧瞧这是谁家欠粮不交。陈家女儿的屁股虽然不小，但毕竟年纪小，受不住藤棍昏死过去，潘县令开恩饶了她，让她撅着光腚示众，但是不打她了。陈氏继续抽打，半天下来，陈氏的屁股已经血肉模糊，藤棍打在血臀上直往肉里陷，溅起阵阵血珠，周围看戏的乡民却津津有味，时不时讨论母女俩谁的屁股夹起肉棍来舒服。最后陈家男人借到粮回来才把母女俩给放了。\n\n张廷范与潘县令一见面，可谓‘相见恨晚’，一路上有说有笑。\n\n夹道欢迎的乡民并没有在意队首的他俩，目光倒是全被杨季英吸引去了，杨季英骑马时挺拔的身姿飒爽俏丽，为了方便打仗，杨季英将衣装改得贴身，丰腴有致的身材暴露无遗，尤其是纤细腰枝下那对撅着的大屁股，肥润饱满，粗长的大腿夹着马鞍，巨臀沉沉的压在鞍上前后摩擦，腚上的厚肉挤得变形，街边站着的乡民哪见过这般销魂的身子，个个望眼欲穿，黑压压的人头跟着杨季英的屁股攒动着，唯恐少看了几眼。\n\n“没想到朝廷军中还要这样漂亮的娘们。”\n\n“哟喂看这大腚，比俺村里花儿的还大，肏起来肯定飘一样！”\n\n“啧啧，俺听说屁股越大的娘们越骚，床上功夫更是不得了”\n\n“她这骚腚得累死一头牛！私底下肯定是个骚货。我要有本事不把她大屁股肏裂！”\n\n“我要能摊上这样一个媳妇，累死俺都值了！哈哈哈哈”\n\n“嘘，别让听见了。就你俩这德行，还是老老实实种地，下辈子再想吧”\n\n......\n\n转眼湘军在清河县驻扎了半月，一日，杨季英奉命征粮，有户人家主人是李寡妇，四五十岁，乃潘县令的娘家亲戚，但是丈夫死得早成了寡妇，平时仗着跟潘县令的关系，飞扬跋扈，收粮的人都识趣的绕过李寡妇家。可杨季英初来乍到没几天，根本不知，跟李寡妇发生摩擦，附近的农户都来看热闹，杨季英以抗拒粮税为由，强行从李寡妇家里征走了粮，这点粮对李寡妇而言虽然不算什么，但李寡妇看杨季英不顺眼，竟辱骂起杨季英，言辞不堪入耳，杨季英没有理会，但副官婉儿一气之下给了李寡妇两耳光，直打的李寡妇嘴角流血，不敢再骂，杨季英走后，平时没吃过亏的李寡妇左思右想也咽不下这口气。\n\n第二天清晨，杨季英与往常一样正在巡视马厩，突然有士卒来报，让杨季英速去操练场报到。杨季英不明所以的来到了操练场，一进场中大帐便看到台上坐着张廷范与潘县令，二人正在喝茶，再一瞧，台下还跪着个熟悉的身影，正是昨日的张寡妇，杨季英隐隐感觉有些不安。\n\n张寡妇一见到杨季英就开始哭诉杨季英如何欺辱于她，时不时指指自己带着巴掌印的脸，声泪俱下。杨季英解释，李寡妇胡搅蛮缠，不承认自己拒交公粮，控诉杨季英欺压民女，羞辱自己，潘县令也表示李寡妇的粮早就交过了。实际上在杨季英之前，李寡妇的粮并没有交过，是潘县令在账上做了手脚，但杨季英并不知情，一时百口莫辩，神情窘迫。\n\n“杨季英，还不快快跟李夫人赔个不是！”张廷范率先打破僵局。\n\n杨季英满肚委屈，吃了哑巴亏，勉强跟李寡妇作了个揖说道：“昨日多有得罪，还望李夫人见谅”\n\n“哼，多征了我粮还打我，一句赔礼就完了？天理何在？”李寡妇没好气的说。\n\n“多征的粮会退还给你，杨将军也赔了不是，算了吧。”潘县令打圆场道。\n\n“那你说说你想怎么半？只要合情合理本将一定满足。”张廷范大义凛然道。\n\n“张将军英明，替小人做主！那我就直说了，昨日杨季英在大庭广众之下打了我，今日我也要打回来！”\n\n“嗯，你接着说。”张廷范兴致勃勃说道。\n\n“杨将军副官的手劲我比不了，我要用鞭子，就不抽杨将军的脸了，改抽杨将军的屁股吧。小女子的力气小，抽三十鞭子不过分吧？”\n\n“不过分，判杨季英给李寡妇抽三十鞭子，杨季英，你可知罪？”\n\n“这......末将知罪！”杨季英咬着牙道，心中满是愤懑。\n\n“我还有两个要求。”李寡妇道，引来杨的怒目，李却丝毫没有理睬。\n\n“哦？说来听听。”张廷范饶有兴致道。\n\n“第一，杨季英的副官打我脸时我可没戴什么，我打杨将军时也要光着。第二，杨季英大庭广众下打我脸，我也要在大庭广众下打回来。”\n\n张廷范思索了一下，表示同意。\n\n杨季英跟着李寡妇来到操练场，场上放着一条长凳，不一会儿操练场外就围了一圈乡民，听闻李寡妇要鞭杨季英的光腚，都想要一睹为快。\n\n张廷范见状下令准许乡民进入，乡民欢呼谢恩，很快杨季英跟李寡妇四周就挤满了人，还有乡民络绎不绝的赶来，黑压压的人头攒动着，几名士卒横着兵器维持秩序，张廷范与潘县令坐在前面一边喝茶一边说笑。\n\n“还不赶紧把衣物脱了！今天可得好好教训教训你这骚腚！”李寡妇一脸凶狠道。\n\n杨季英没有理会，自顾自把亵裤脱去，露出一对白臀肥润隆翘，大腿肉多粗实，腰细如柳，皮肤油亮，姿色惊艳众人，周围看客爆发一阵惊叹，潘县令也瞪大了眼睛，满脸横肉挤出笑容，嘴里嘟囔着：“好一身美肉！”乡民更直言不讳。“俺嘚天这大腚真白！白嘚发光”“啧啧肉不少...”“天天鸡鸭鱼肉，这腚才能养恁大”“哈哈哈”......\n\n李寡妇见了更来气，连声冲杨季英喊：“快点趴好，把骚腚撅起来！”\n\n杨季英害臊的脸通红，心里想着赶快完事，便趴到长凳上，撅起光腚。李寡妇看出杨季英害臊，嚷嚷着让杨季英两腿分开，跪在长凳上，双手撑着地。\n\n杨季英不愿意，李寡妇便说：“杨将军的屁股可比小民的脸都精贵，哎呀呀看来我们贱民就是贱民啊......”一旁乡民也都跟着起哄，迫于压力杨季英只能一咬牙，跪在长凳上，肉腿张开，伏身用手撑地，肉臀随之一拱，一张，股沟张开，形如受肏之母狗。\n\n围观群众看到杨季英幽深的臀沟大开，黄褐屁.眼微微隆起，羞处两块饱满肥肉垂在腿间，很多人的阳物已经竖起，燥热难耐。众人目光都聚焦于一点，就连维持秩序的士卒都直勾勾盯着看，潘县令绕到杨季英身后驻足，场间一片寂静，只听到萧瑟秋风的嘶鸣，杨季英的荫毛被风吹动，不停摇晃。\n\n李寡妇妒火中烧，二话不说，从旁边士卒手中夺过马鞭对折，再一扭，两股做一股，卯足了气力，对着杨季英的屁股抽打起来。\n\n“嗖啪！”“嗖啪！”的声响打破了寂静，众人伸直脖子，瞪大眼珠，看马鞭狠狠落在杨季英臀肉上，大白屁股立刻隆起一道道血檩，激起阵阵肉浪，李寡妇一点也没有客气，使出了吃奶的力气，杨季英虽然做了心理准备，但没想到这李寡妇力气竟然如此大，有些招架不住，连喘粗气，“嗯啊”叫唤着，屁股随着鞭子扭动起来，“啪啪啪！”转眼十五鞭过去，杨季英额头冒汗，咬着牙坚持，李寡妇见状竟奋力抽打杨季英的臀沟，一鞭子下去杨季英猛的一激灵，黄褐的屁.眼变成深红，肉缝耸起一道骇人的血檩，杨季英连喊三声“莫打！”，李寡妇没有理会，扬起马鞭恶狠狠抽向杨季英屁.眼，杨季英疼的尖叫不止，屁.眼淤血肿大起来，如泡开的大洞果。\n\n“李寡妇真是歹毒啊！专打屁.......\n\n没抽几鞭子，杨季英屁.眼上的皮便渗出血来，一对肉腿止不住抖动，神色扭曲。李寡妇不管三七二十一，犹如泼妇一般，一只脚踩着凳子，左手抓着杨季英的屁股往外掰，把股沟撑大，右手握着鞭子对准了杨季英的屁.眼使劲抽打，杨季英臀沟里皮肉翻滚，屁.眼如同被千针扎穿一般，叫声直哆嗦。众人看入了神，对着杨季英的屁.眼指指点点，有说有笑，全然不顾杨季英的惨叫。\n\n李寡妇打完了鞭子，往杨季英屁股上一挂，众人这才回过神来，几十双眼珠仍盯着杨季英的后庭，此时已是血痕淋淋，腚沟里更是血红一片，屁.眼鼓的像颗大红枣，渗出粒粒血珠。杨季英惨痛喘着气，感觉似有无数只蚂蚁往臀沟的肉里钻，只觉天旋地转。过了好一会杨季英才回过神，想起自己下身裸露在众人面前，杨季英连忙起身，把亵裤拉上，羞得面红耳赤。\n\n杨季英心想总算完了，忍痛夹着屁股，正准备回去，不料张廷范却说：“杨将军留步，你和李夫人的私人恩怨暂且了了，现在要谈谈公事了。”\n\n杨季英心里咯噔一下，怎么还有公事？什么公事？正欲离开的众人听到，连忙围了回来，够着头、竖起耳朵，想看看还有什么好戏。\n\n张廷范对潘县令点了点头，潘县令接着说：“杨将军啊。这个多征粮是要按贪赃处置，按照官府规定，要惩以五十大板。还有，你羞辱良妇，目无法纪，要再惩以笞刑五十，二罪并罚，一共百下。还望杨将军体谅，不要让本官为难，来人呐！”\n\n“等等！”还没等杨季英说完话，从人群中走出来四名衙役，两人抓住杨季英，另外两人将杨季英的上衣、亵裤和靴子扒了个精光，围观的乡民顿时炸开了锅，纷纷伸直脖子、瞪大眼珠、微笑的默叹的还有议论的，好不热闹......风韵美妇一丝不挂的站在众人中间，丰满挺拔的乳房、肥大的屁股与纤细的腰形成强烈反差，白净的身子与屁股上的血檩相得益彰，场间气氛热烈起来，四名衙役迫不及待的抱住杨季英，把她按趴在长凳上，杨季英挣扎起来，丰满的屁股一拱一抬，牵动起众人心扉，最终一女难敌四男，杨季英还是被死死绑在了长凳上，浑身赤.裸，乌黑长发散在脖间，丰满的屁股自然撅起，芳香四溢，众人的裤裆早已一柱擎天，有些竟已湿润。\n\n“杨季英难道你还不认罪？是想加刑吗？”张廷范见杨季英挣扎便问道。\n\n“我.......认罪，愿意受刑。”听到加刑，杨季英胆怯了许多，好汉不吃眼前亏，杨季英最终铁下心认了这顿打。话音刚落，两名衙役便抡来两把毛竹大板，板子经过油浸、阴干，结实耐用，众人看到毛竹大板，不禁冒出冷汗，生怕哪天打到自己臀上。\n\n一旁的李寡妇冷嘲热讽道：“早知今日何必当初，哼！今天定叫你的骚腚皮开肉绽！”周围看戏的人不嫌事大，催促衙役快打。\n\n衙役干练的往杨季英屁股上倒一瓢冷水激臀，杨季英打了个冷颤，屁股瑟瑟发抖，衙役二话不说，举起毛竹大板，腰背发力，左右开弓，只听“呼...啪！”两声清脆的声响，势大力沉的毛竹大板裹挟秋风猛然落到杨季英的大屁股上，掀起一阵巨大肉浪，毛竹大板陷进肉里两寸多深，可见其威力之大，劲道之猛烈。\n\n“啊！！！”杨季英疼的尖叫起来，屁股上立刻隆起一道两边紫中间发白的檩子，这是因为毛竹大板有弧度。一板子下来屁股明显肿起，如面团膨胀，肿起的肉上泛着血光。杨季英心中大为惊愕，没想到这毛竹大板竟比军棍还要生痛，剩下那么多板子这可得了？衙役看着杨季英的大屁股慢慢肿起，欲火中烧，不知不觉便用了十二分的力气。\n\n“啪！啪！啪！”“啊！！！啊！！！”板子如雨点般落到杨季英屁股上，没几下杨季英就嚎叫起来，衙役全神贯注在屁股上，没有理会杨季英的嚎叫，有条不紊的挥舞着毛竹大板，往肥屁股上打去，杨季英的臀肉随板子凹凸弹跳，热情的乡民齐声替衙役报起数来，“四！”“五！”... 空旷的操练场上一时间回响起板子震天的声响与嚎叫、报数的声音，上下翻飞的肥臀慢慢变成了血红，没到三十板子就皮开肉绽，鲜血从破开的皮间流出，杨季英一次次失声惨叫，汗水浸湿的黑发散乱的贴在脸上，股间的汗水蛰咬着臀沟，杨季英疼的高高撅起屁股，拱来拱去，却被误以为是在迎合板子，使得众人更加兴奋，指着杨季英说：“看这个骚货，还一个劲的撅屁股”“她肯定是喜欢这样，真是下贱！”“咯咯早说嘛”......\n\n一阵热火朝天后，五十大板一板不少的打完，杨季英的屁股血肉模糊，肿胀的屁股直冒热气，两瓣肥臀上挂着两块血口子，不停冒血，浸湿了板子，有的碎皮碎肉粘在板子上，掉在地上，血臀惨不忍睹。围观的人却仍有说有笑的移论着，眉飞色舞。,

杨季英的肥屁股在军棍猛攻下狂颤不止，血肉直飞，羞处的肉不受控制的痉挛，溅起的血滴雨点一般落下，台上地上士卒衣服上全是血，军棍剥掉的碎肉有的挂在屁股上、有的落下来、还有的粘在军棍上......没到二十下杨季英就昏死过去。士卒用水把杨季英泼醒，接着打，杨季英叫声越来越微弱。\n\n“这样打下去怕是真要打死人了。”\n\n“是啊，太吓人了。”\n\n“打死才好，让这骚婆娘没机会再祸祸别人！”李寡妇恶狠狠的说。\n\n打了四十多下，杨季英已经半死不活，张廷范见状叫停了军棍，拿出了准备好的书纸，来到杨季英面前说：“杨将军，你的屁股都烂得不成样子了，本都统出于仁心，这样吧。剩下的军棍就不打了，但是你屡次违反军纪，本都统还是要亲自管教管教你才行，这是军令状，你签了，以后本督统有权管教你，你不能违抗，否则军法处置。你看怎么样？”\n\n杨季英现在哪里还顾得上什么，二话不说就签下了军令状。潘县令一脸横肉的眯着眼笑，羡慕张廷范收了个如此俏丽玩物。\n\n乡民见事儿已经完了，便纷纷散去，李寡妇出了气，心满意足的回家去了。\n\n\n---\n\n深秋到了，天气越来越凉，安庆城内的太平军已经快撑不下去，不几日就将攻克安庆。自从签下了军令状，杨季英的日子可谓苦不堪言，短短两个月，杨季英已经挨了不下十顿，稍微出点差错就要军法伺候。就说最近的一次，因为早期监操忘了戴帽子，按说也不是什么事，操练的士卒许多也没有戴，偏偏被张廷范的副官撞见，报给张廷范，判了杨季英一个军仪不整的罪，打了一顿鞭子。\n\n虽然杨季英这两个月挨了不少顿打，却也多以军鞭、皮带为主，虽然疼但伤身不多，好的也快。这也是张廷范故意的，他现在揪住了杨季英的辫子，反倒看杨季英顺眼了起来，杨季英也察觉到了，不然以这样的频率挨军法，早就一命呜呼了。\n\n“启禀杨将军！张都统召将军商议军情。”“知道了”。杨季英随传令士卒一起往张廷范军帐走去。想到距上次挨鞭已有七八日了，想必今晚又是‘凶多吉少’。穿过军营，杨季英饱满挺翘的屁股扭动着，又引得身后士卒侧目偷看，对此杨季英已经习惯了。\n\n推开帐门，张廷范坐在帐内：“是季英啊，快进来！”\n\n杨季英进入落座，周围空无一人，只有张廷范和两名侍卫，便问道：“怎么不见其他将军？”\n\n“哦，今日之事只用和杨将军一人商议就行了，季英前几日的伤势如何了？”\n\n“谢都统关心，已经没事了。”\n\n“我近日从城里潘县令那讨得几副上好膏药，对皮外伤有奇效，只需敷上一日，连伤疤都能祛除，特地拿来给杨将军试试。”\n\n“末将谢过都统。”杨季英作揖道，张廷范面露悦色。\n\n“杨将军客气啦！”\n\n稍作停顿后张廷范又道。\n\n“今天找杨将军来其实还有一事。”\n\n张廷范干咳了两声面露难色，杨季英见状请他直言，张廷范这才继续说道：“几日后，八旗协都和德光要来巡视军情，你也知道，咱们绿营的粮响得依仗人家八旗...”\n\n“和大人来巡查和我有何关系？还请督统明示。”杨季英一头雾水道。\n\n“听闻和德光好女色。”张廷范嘿嘿一笑接着说：“杨将军是咱们军里出了名的美将，搁到哪里都是万人倾慕！所以...能否委屈委屈杨将军...”\n\n“这是要污我的清白？！”杨季英发了火，这跟做娼有甚么区别？\n\n“不敢不敢！杨将军误会了！只是委屈你演一出黄盖，我当周瑜，咱们一个愿打一个愿挨，让和德光饱饱眼福就成，绝不干别的事，更不敢脏杨将军的身子！”\n\n杨季英仍然不肯，张廷范又说：“杨将军，这事儿要是办好了，也算是大功一件呐，咱们军里多少张嘴要吃饭，全都得靠和德光......放心我决不让杨将军白挨，事成之后，我给杨将军以‘督粮有功’请赏，这一风光，杨将军以后的路也好走啦！”\n\n杨季英陷入沉思，虽说要牺牲一下自己，但张廷范的条件着实是吸引人，她以降将身份入清，最缺的便是军功以表忠心......左思右想之下，杨季英心一横点了头。\n\n“末将明白了。”\n\n“季英真是深明大义啊！”张廷范喜笑颜开，忙替杨季英斟了杯茶说：“这几日你好好歇息，军务无需劳烦，到时候只管同我演戏便可。”\n\n......\n\n几日后，潘府庭院内，张廷范与潘县令正在陪和德光喝酒。\n\n和德光，满洲正黄旗人，出身满人贵族，领八旗之一，节制湘淮绿营各军。长得是五大三粗，一脸横肉，眯眯眼，头上扎着小辫。和德光仗着出身飞扬跋扈，谁也不敢怎么招他，就连宫里的大太监见了他都得客客气气。传言他有次在怡红院寻乐，强迫一名妓女一边交媾一边斟酒，妓女不慎将酒杯跌碎，和德光便将她绑在桌上，叫侍从把一个铜漏斗插进妓女后庭，再往里倒热茶，妓女疼的乱叫，和德光拍手叫好，又令侍从用粗马鞭抽她屁股，侍从一开始没把握好劲道，几鞭子下来女的屁股就掉了半层皮，妓女身子骨弱，惨叫几声晕了过去，和德光见状让侍从把她浇醒，吩咐侍从把握力道，既要让她疼的死去活来，又不能晕过去......和德光的侍从是狱卒出身，自然懂得，立刻换了打法，改用鞭梢发力，虽鞭鞭皮开肉绽，但伤口细长，不至于疼昏，可能打的数量却变多了，原先那妓女的屁股最多挨二十鞭就没了皮，现在可以打近百鞭也不至出血过多，这下妓女可算是倒了血霉了，被绑在桌上足足挨了二百多鞭，叫的是撕心裂肺，晃扭得整张大桌都跟着咯吱作响，房外过廊的人听得不禁胆寒，老鸨在屋外急得直打转，生怕和德光打坏了姑娘，又害怕和德光连她一块打，只能眼巴巴看着，等和德光一走，赶忙进屋，却发现那姑娘浑身赤.裸的趴在桌子上，人已经昏了过去，从后背到大腿密密麻麻的都是伤痕，尤其是屁股，反反复复抽了三四遍，红的紫的白的黄的一并绽在臀上，羞处更是布满鞭痕，抽了不知道多少遍，血流不止，把老鸨吓得不轻。从此以后，和德光在京城妓院里算是恶名远扬，妓院的人都管他叫‘和阎王’。\n\n言归正传，现在张廷范对和德光是尽力巴结，但接风宴上和德光表现的不冷不热，张廷范特地又在潘府再摆盛宴招待，还安排了杨季英的两位副将林婉儿和秦冰凤侍宴左右，有美人在侧果然就是不一样，和德光这回甚是高兴，一扫之前的冷淡态度。张廷范看在眼里，乐在心中，一旁的潘县令也跟着偷乐。\n\n“来来和大人，我再敬您一杯！”张廷范举起酒杯，潘县令也赶紧举起酒杯，这里就数他的官最小，对谁都得恭恭敬敬的，生怕惹着谁，把他小小的潘府掀了。\n\n“张大人客气，客气啦！”和德光笑呵呵道，举起酒杯一饮而尽，身边的林婉儿斟酒，和德光趁机揩油，林婉儿因杨季英之前特别交代，故而敢怒不敢言，只装作若无其事，和德光见状更加肆无忌惮，手在林婉儿的屁股上捏来掐去，好不快活，林婉儿两团屁股肉让和德光抓得火辣辣的，也只忍着默不作声。\n\n“和大人真是好酒量啊！在下佩服佩服！”潘县令时不时拍马屁，和德光也就敷衍回应，眼神全在林婉儿跟秦冰凤二位女副官身上。\n\n时至晌午，酒过三巡菜过五味，秋风凉爽宜人，就在几人交谈正欢之时，侍卫突然来报：“禀报都统！前几日征的军粮方才已送至粮仓，督粮的杨将军正在驿馆歇息。”\n\n“哦知道了。”张廷范淡淡说道。\n\n“督粮的杨将军......是杨季英将军么”和德光昨日听潘县令说过军中有一女将杨季英，生的貌美身材傲人，风韵十足。潘县令把她夸的是天花乱坠，和德光但是听着就觉得心痒痒的，一下子就惦记了上了杨季英。\n\n“正是杨季英，怎么，和大人还认识杨将军？”张廷范顺着话说，他和潘县令早就设计好了，就等着和德光接这茬。\n\n“不认识，只是略有耳闻。”和德光意识到自己有些失态，尴尬笑笑，连忙摆出清高模样。张廷范也不着急，故意岔开话题聊些别的，但和德光早已心不在焉，说了没几句，就忍不住绕了回来：“杨将军督粮颇为辛苦，今日宴席何不请杨将军同乐？”\n\n“和大人所言甚至，来人，速请杨将军！”张廷范笑道，一旁的潘县令连连附和。\n\n不一会儿，杨季英走了过来。\n\n和德光一见到杨季英，两颗眼珠子像粘在人身上似的，眼前这位杨将军，可谓是英姿飒爽，腰肢纤细，豪乳挺立，高高隆起的肥臀好似昭然若现，两腿匀称修长，虽身着戎装，仍看得出风韵无穷，和德光心里不禁暗暗赞叹。\n\n“末将杨季英参见和大人、张都统，见过潘县令。”\n\n“哦哦，杨将军不用拘礼，快请入座！”和德光缓过神来，忙献殷勤，眼神仍在杨季英身上不停游离，杨季英颇有些不自在，几番敬酒之后，张廷范适时说道：“杨将军啊，方才到的这批军粮，是不是二日前就应该送到啊？”\n\n杨季英心领神会，立刻回答道：“这…确实是二日前就应该到的，因为末将疏于督促，运粮士卒怠工偷懒，误了些时日......末将有罪。”\n\n“既然如此，那杨将军说说该当何罪？”张廷范笑着说。\n\n“督粮不力，导致军粮误期三日以下者，当打军棍五十。”杨季英利落道。\n\n“恩，不过念你是初犯，且督粮一事劳苦功高，就不打军棍，改打皮板吧。”\n\n“谢督统开恩！”\n\n张廷范瞄了一眼旁边，果不其然，和德光已是躁动难耐，嘴皮子抿个不停，但仍装作矜持，硬是一句话也没说。张廷范心里一笑，看你能装到甚么时候，于是又说道：“行了，我现在公务在身，杨将军自己回军营领罚吧。”\n\n“遵命！”杨季英起身就要离开，这下和德光总算是急了。\n\n“且慢！我奉命前来视查，自然要尽心尽职，今天杨将军受罚，我理应亲自监罚。”和德光言辞急切的说道，眼睛直勾勾看着杨季英，生怕杨季英走掉。\n\n“和大人事必躬亲，真是我辈之楷模！”一旁的潘县令笑道。\n\n“既然如此......那就劳借潘县令衙内的刑具，在此就地执罚，如何？”\n\n“好！这样甚好！”和德光一听更是喜出望外，连连称是。\n\n张廷范挥挥手，士卒从院后搬来一台松木刑床，刑床色泽深沉，构造稳重，床沿中部有两根竖杆，竖杆上高中低有三个洞，和德光看到心里立刻猜到了个大概，反倒是杨季英一头雾水，松木刑床她是见所未见、闻所未闻，张廷范事先也没跟她说。\n\n面对杨季英疑惑的神情，张廷范只对她点点头，示意她不要担心，杨季英心里虽然不悦，但眼下还是以大局为重。于是杨季英二话不说，爬上了刑床。\n\n“且慢，杨将军是不是忘了甚么？”张廷范笑了笑，扯扯自己的衣领。\n\n“末将明白了，谢督统提醒。”杨季英反应过来，连忙把军靴和裤子脱掉，瞬时一对雪白肥硕的屁股露了出来，长期骑马锻炼，杨季英的屁股又大又翘，两团屁股肉像面团一样白，又不乏紧实的质感，颇有异域风情。这让只见过妓院女子的和德光看呆了眼。\n\n杨季英在士卒指引下，跪趴到刑床上，士卒把她双腿绑在刑床两边，又把她胳膊反绑到两根竖杆上高的洞上，拿来一根粗圆木棍，横插在两根竖杆中部的洞里，杨季英的腰被粗圆木棍这么一压，屁股自然就撅得更高，杨季英这才反应过来，只感觉后庭到羞处都凉飕飕的，羞的脸一红。身后和德光探着脑袋，如狼似虎般看着，杨季英的屁.眼深红偏黄，周边褶皱比妓院里娇弱的妓女粗砺一些，颇具豪粗野性之美感，死死勾住了和德光的魂儿。\n\n张廷范走上前，把粗木棍抽出来比划比划，按到了低的洞里，杨季英的蜂腰又给压下去一些，整个呈凹陷状，屁股也撅得更高，两瓣肉臀张的更开，姿势更加屈辱。杨季英脸憋得通红，小声嘀咕着：“这是干甚！”张廷范笑笑也会不回话，又走到前面，不等杨季英反应，一把把杨季英的上衣扯开，两颗石榴般的乳白奶子被剥了出来，在空中提溜着，杨季英急得连忙小声说：“张廷范你...快给我穿回去！”\n\n“做戏要做全嘛，杨将军莫怪”张廷范凑到杨季英耳边说到，杨季英回了句“你个杀千刀的！”，张廷范笑了笑，知道杨季英还是会顾全大局的。果不其然，杨季英狠狠白了张廷范几眼，也没了后话，就这样撅着大白屁股，两颗奶子露在外面，等着挨皮板子了。\n\n张廷范回到座上挥挥手，林婉儿和秦冰凤一人拿着一根牛皮板子走到杨季英身边，潘府衙门用的牛皮板子和军里用的差不多，只是表面打磨过，更加光滑，打起女犯来皮破的比较慢，流血少，可以打久些，女犯也得忍受更久的痛苦滋味，很多女犯都撑不过牛皮板子这关，该招的都招了，不该招的也招了。\n\n“等下打的时候务必用力！千万不能手下留情，知道吗。”杨季英再次叮嘱身旁的副官，林婉儿和秦冰凤心里也明白，连连点头。\n\n随着张廷范一声令下，林婉儿和秦冰凤便左右开弓开始抽打。“啪啪啪啪啪！！！”牛皮板子急促的抽打在杨季英的屁股上，杨季英运足精气，任由牛皮板子重重打在臀上，也没有夹紧屁股，这样牛皮板子打的臀浪更漂亮，这是张廷范交待过她的。只见杨季英两团屁股肉擀面似的晃来晃去，臀浪阵阵不停，一道道红印接连浮在臀上，彼此交错纵横，重叠处渐渐变紫，一幅姹紫嫣红的肥臀图渐渐清晰。\n\n和德光看得兴高采烈，嘴唇干燥起皮，也顾不上喝口茶酒，看到杨季英肥硕的屁股随皮板子晃来晃去，厚实的臀肉凹弹不止，心里也跟着痒痒。\n\n林婉儿和秦冰凤谨遵指示，每一下都卯足了劲，劈里啪啦像放炮似的，杨季英咬紧牙关，疼的冷汗直冒，原先乳白无暇的肥臀很快就布满紫檩，五十皮板子打完，已经有很多处破皮，渗出血来。\n\n“回禀督统，皮板打完了。”\n\n“好，辛苦两位副官了。”张廷范又说道：“怎么样，和大人可还满意？”\n\n“恩，张督统果然是治军有方，赏罚分明。不过嘛.....”\n\n“不过甚么？”\n\n“不过，二位副官毕竟是女子身，气力还是差些，杨将军的屁股只渗了少许血，微微发紫。”\n\n“这是因为官衙和军里用的牛皮板子不一样，官衙用的表面滑，不容易出血，方才二位副官的确是用足了力气。”潘县令打圆场道。\n\n“非也，我看就是二位副官没有用真劲儿，既然如此，杨将军就得重新打，而且杨将军教导属下无方，要再加五十，打一百下！”-

张廷范出乎意料的反驳潘县令，潘县令一听，赶忙改口附和：“是我眼拙没看出来。”\n\n潘县令和张廷范心里都清楚，和德光这样说无外乎是想多饱眼福，先顺着他的意思说，张廷范自然有转圜的余地。林婉儿和秦冰凤一听急了，但想到之前因为冲动让杨将军受了加罚，这次便不敢贸然开口，纷纷转头看向杨季英，此时杨季英还撅着紫屁股，结结实实的绑在刑床上。\n\n张廷范走到杨季英身边，俯身问道：“杨将军是想回军营受罚，还是在这里受罚啊？”言外之意，如果杨季英不想演了可以离开，回去自然也不用挨皮板子，张廷范不愧老谋深算，既顺了和德光的意，又给杨季英留了退路。\n\n现在局势全握在了杨季英手里，她如果要回军营，和德光也不好再阻拦，况且已经挨了五十牛皮板子给和德光欣赏。午后秋风萧萧，庭院里众人都没了声音，好几双眼睛都聚集在杨季英身上，关切的、担忧的、如狼似饥的......\n\n“末将愿意在此受罚。”\n\n“杨将军，可想好了？”\n\n“末将想好了。”\n\n杨季英心想粮饷要紧，还是稳妥些好。身后的和德光一听果然高兴的不得了，张廷范见状便也随了杨季英的意思。\n\n\n---\n\n“二位副官也累了，这次就让潘府的人代劳吧。”张廷范说道。潘县令领会了意思，赶忙答应下来，随即离开，走到府外唤来两名牢卒，他们都是经验丰富的行刑老手。潘县令交待道：“等会打杨将军皮板子的时候，要慢慢打，声响要大，但不能真伤着杨将军，懂了吗？”\n\n“请大人放心！交给属下。”\n\n潘县令是何等左右逢源之人，张廷范要整杨季英时他帮着咬，张廷范想护杨季英时他就得帮着照顾，跟着张廷范混，他小小的县令才能当的长久。\n\n不一会儿，两个狱卒就拿着两根牛皮板子进了庭院，这两根牛皮板子比之前两根稍微薄些，表面粗糙，容易打出效果，实际威力却小一些，不至伤到筋骨。潘县令手里拿着一壶东西也回来了。\n\n“潘县令这壶里装的是甚么？”张廷范和和德光都没看出来。\n\n“油。”潘县令呵呵笑道，接着说：“秋天干燥，臀皮容易皲裂，涂了油打更好，伤也更好恢复，不耽误杨将军几日后再去督粮。”\n\n“原来如此！潘县令真是心思缜密，佩服佩服！”和德光夸道，张廷范却笑道：“我看，潘县令所谓保护皮是假，涂了油，打得声音更响亮，让她更害臊才是真！”\n\n“真是甚么都瞒不过张督统。”潘县令道，一旁的和德光听见哈哈大笑起来，潘县令和张廷范也都跟着笑了起来。\n\n杨季英的屁股浇上了油，阳光照下，磨盘一样的大屁股油光亮丽，屁.眼周边的鸡皮疙瘩像一粒粒黄米粒儿，皮上挂不住的油顺着臀沟，汇聚在荫毛处，啪嗒啪嗒的往下滴......“啪！啪！啪！”牛皮板子有条不紊的落在杨季英的臀上，涂过油的屁股打起来声音格外的响亮，杨季英摒足气，本想又是一场煎熬，却不料这牛皮板子虽然声音响，却没有方才那么难熬，只感觉两瓣屁股被皮板子抽得乱颤，虽火辣辣的，但后劲不足，秋风一吹，屁股麻酥酥的，杨季英不觉把屁股撅得更高，痛并充满快感。\n\n“啪！”“二十五。”“啪！”“二十六”......\n\n桌前三人觥筹交错，谈笑风生，面前两个狱卒正慢慢抽打着杨季英的油亮肥臀，汗香夹杂着微微血味慢慢弥漫，哪几下抽的重了，杨季英也疼的叫出来，声音飒爽明亮，两颗奶子随着皮板子的节奏摇来摇去，看得众人心旷神怡。\n\n等皮板子打完，杨季英的屁股已经成了猪肝色，两块巴掌还大的紫檩子肿得很高，上面带着斑斑血迹，像两颗熟透的油桃，裂开的皮弹指可破。\n\n和德光停下酒杯，上前验刑。\n\n“不错，这里还有这里都吃足了皮板......嗯？...杨将军的羞处怎么？”\n\n杨季英这才发觉自己的羞处已经流出了许多白黏黏的浊液，粘的哪儿都是。原来杨季英挨皮板子时竟然起了感觉，连她自己都没意识到自己淫态百出。\n\n“末将知错！”\n\n“杨季英知的是甚么错啊？”和德光色迷迷的问道。\n\n“末将不该...不该在行刑时...行淫秽之事。”\n\n“杨将军不要害怕，这也不是甚么大事儿...这样吧，杨将军你说一个自罚的办法，如果我和张兄潘兄都满意，这事就当没有发生过，怎么样？”\n\n“谢和大人开恩。”杨季英思索了一会说道：“末将辱没军法，请鞭五十以正法典。”\n\n“好！不过嘛，鞭五十太多了，我看打二十鞭子就够了。但是这二十鞭子还需由我的侍卫来打，要是你能挨完这二十鞭子不叫出声，这事便作罢，要是你叫了，咱们就按宫里处罚宫女淫秽的法子来办怎么样？”\n\n杨季英虽然不情愿，但为了粮饷大事，还是点头同意了。\n\n“张兄，你意下如何？”\n\n“既然杨将军愿意，我自然没有异议。”张廷范客气道，心里把和德光祖宗骂了个遍。\n\n和德光向潘府借了把长凳，很快就搬到了庭院。\n\n杨季英刚从刑床上解下来，就被迫趴到了长凳上，和德光的侍卫三下五除二把杨季英手脚绑好，特地留一对肥臀可以左右扭动，和德光看着杨季英肥美的巨臀与两条白腻的肉腿，春心荡漾。\n\n侍卫解下腰间的鞭子，杨季英扭头看了看，棕黑色的鞭身二尺多长，比之前的挨过的鞭子粗的多，鞭梢还多缠了层牛筋，滋味恐怕......杨季英的心凉了半截。\n\n和德光笑了笑，没有说话，搬了个马扎坐到杨季英面前，对侍卫挥了挥手，示意开打。\n\n上文说过，和德光的侍卫狱卒出身，最擅长鞭子。\n\n只见侍卫扬起军鞭，双腿半分，腰身一扭，胳膊猛的一甩，棕黑的粗鞭飕的朝杨季英的肥臀狠狠打去，霎那间空旷的大帐回荡一声爆裂声，杨季英的肥臀猛然一抖，皮肉瞬间裂开，一条醒目的血紫色鞭痕乍现而出，杨季英一个激灵，差点叫出声来。没等杨季英缓过气来，第二鞭子也狠狠落下，打的杨季英肥臀又是一颤，留下一道与上道交叉的鞭痕，冒出血色，像是在杨季英大屁股上画了个‘血叉’。\n\n“唔...”杨季英深深吸了口气。没想到这鞭子竟如此狠毒，比之前挨过的所有鞭子都疼数倍不止，这下可怎么消受的了？都怪自己自作聪明，现在骑虎难下了......杨季英绝望的咬紧牙关，肠子都悔青了。\n\n鞭子飕飕的抽打起来，声音异常凛冽，打的杨季英肥臀乱颤，大屁股扭来扭去，油水汗水和血水铺满大臀，十分销魂。虽然杨季英竭力挣扎，但鞭子长了嘴眼似的盯着杨季英肥臀咬，任由她怎么扭动，总能狠狠抽在两瓣肥臀上，杨季英绷紧身子，发出呜呜的哽咽声，两串泪珠从眼角滑落。\n\n“好狠的鞭子，杨将军怎么受得住啊...”潘县令小声嘀咕道。\n\n“唉，这也是杨季英自找的，早听我的回军营不就好了。”张廷范叹了口气。\n\n“杨将军也是为了粮饷着想嘛，回去好好休养休养便是了。”潘县令慰道。\n\n“嗯，潘兄所言极是。”\n\n和德光看着杨季英扭动着硕臀硬撑的样子，甚是美艳，不禁欲火中烧，一把拽起杨季英的长发，杨季英被迫扬起头来，白脯脯的奶子挺立在半空，随肥臀一起摆动起来，姿势更加销魂，杨季英害臊的闭上眼睛。\n\n侍卫十分卖力，十多鞭下来，杨季英的肥臀已经皮开肉绽，紫红的大屁股上炸开道道血花，杨季英只感觉天旋地转，剧痛难忍，无力的扭动着血臀，和德光见杨季英仍未叫喊，心里暗暗佩服，笑着说：“杨将军好耐力啊！”，便给侍卫使了个眼色。\n\n侍卫接到暗示，往边上站开了一点，使鞭子的挥舞半径更大，力道更猛。侍卫举起胳膊，把军鞭抡到身后，再猛的往前挥动，画了个满圆，偌大的势力集中在鞭梢，以及周围缠绕的牛筋上，狠狠砸到杨季英臀上......啪的一声巨响，竟硬生生撕掉块皮，溅起血花，杨季英猛然睁开眼睛，青筋直爆，两条白腿抽搐起来，眼看就要惨叫，侍卫如法炮制，又来一下，杨季英再忍不能，“呜哇”一声尖叫出来，声音如同杀猪一般，屁股死死夹紧，两道异常宽的血口子十分醒目，和德光见状，又做了手势，侍卫便按照原先的力道继续打，杨季英知道自己已经输了，不再顾及什么，连连惨叫起来，嘴中不时叫着：“饶了我吧！别打了!”\n\n侍卫勒紧军鞭，不予理会，快速抽打剩下的几鞭，庭院内传出杨季英凄惨的叫声。鞭子打完，杨季英的肥臀皮开肉绽，血流不止。\n\n“杨将军，这可是你自己不争气啊...来人，扶杨将军起来，准备宫刑。”\n\n\n---\n\n侍卫把杨季英扶起来，顺便把她的上衣扒光，只留下件勉强盖住腹部和双乳的红肚兜，杨季英挺直了身子，标志的蜂腰肥臀，一身好肉尽显。\n\n“你说，按照宫里淫乱的罪，杨将军应该怎么处置啊？”和德光指着一名侍从道。\n\n“禀大人，按宫里规矩，对淫乱的宫女轻则处以‘淫臀五刑’，重则死罪，杨将军是...？”\n\n“废话！当然是轻罪！”和德光骂道，随即变回笑脸对杨季英说道：“杨将军应该不会反悔吧？”\n\n“嗯...”杨季英一千个不愿意。\n\n“哈哈好！杨将军果然痛快，这里不比宫中，没有宫里那些刑具，我们借些潘府的将就用吧，潘县令你说呢？”\n\n“哦哦！甚好甚好，和大人这边请。”潘县令赶忙引路，带和德光去刑房。\n\n等他们走后，张廷范面带愠色问杨季英道：“你说你，何必逞这个强？现在好了，你自求多福吧！”杨季英心里委屈，但也怨不得谁，眼看就要受更大的罪，悔的眼泪都快掉出来了，张廷范见状也消了气，让杨季英再忍忍，散了宴席自己再去帮她讨几幅药膏便是。\n\n不一会儿，和德光和潘县令就回来了。和德光的侍卫让杨季英重新趴到长凳上，把她绑好，两个侍卫各自手持一把竹板，竹板是从毛竹大板上截下来的，有三尺左右长（90厘米），表面萃光，浸好了油，打在屁股上又响又疼，而且板子很宽，乍一看像把木船桨，一竹板下去整块屁股都得颤上几颤。\n\n“禀大人，淫臀五刑第一刑，‘竹板烩肉’，用三尺的竹板，浸好油，责打罪女的屁股若干。要把屁股打至血肿，不能留一点白肉，两瓣臀心要皮开肉绽，血口子至少和碗一般大。”侍卫说得有板有眼，听的杨季英心里直打颤。\n\n“嗯好，不过杨将军也不用太担心，你的屁股想必不用打太多下就可以结束。开始吧。”\n\n“啪！啪！啪！”左右侍卫抄起竹板左右开弓，浸好油的竹板打在肥臀上清脆响亮，好似爆炒臀肉一般。\n\n“啊！疼死我啦！啊！！！”竹板打在纵横交错的血痕上，疼的杨季英呜哇惨叫起来，拍过的臀肉很快充血肿起，把一道道血口子慢慢扩大，连在一起，臀上的皮一点点被竹板打的泛白，侍卫很有经验，一看便知是皮快掉了，于是提高力道，再打几下，杨季英的肥臀立刻皮肉分离，碎皮和鲜血粘在竹板上，把竹板染成了红色......这滋味比刚才的鞭子还要疼上数倍，杨季英哀嚎不止，侍卫毫不留情，加快节奏拍打，竹板打在臀峰两块掉了皮的血口子上，竹板边楞的毛刺狠狠扎进杨季英的臀肉里，疼的杨季英浑身打冷颤，嘴唇直哆嗦，“饶了我吧！！！疼死我了！！！”，双腿直蹬，屁股疯扭，侍卫继续对着两块血口子猛打，“啪啪啪！！！”血口子直往外溅血，慢慢扩大，终于是有了碗口这么大，侍卫这才停下，总共打了约莫七八十下竹板。\n\n侍卫放下沾血的竹板，杨季英的两块屁股蛋子还在不停的震搐，肿的不成样子。\n\n“不错，没想到杨将军的屁股还能熬这么多下，不愧是常年习武，和某佩服。”和德光笑道，杨季英勉强站起来，屁股上的血直往下滴。\n\n“禀大人，淫臀五刑第二刑，‘辣炒苞菜’，用牛皮做的细梢散鞭抽打女犯的羞处，外唇打完后剥开外唇，抽打内唇，每层鞭打二十。”\n\n“这个好，杨将军本就是羞处犯的错，羞处要仔细伺候，每层鞭三十，多加十下。”\n\n“不要啊！大人开恩呐！”杨季英此时已经顾不得面子了。\n\n“是！”侍卫没有理会杨季英，把她架起，面朝上按到刑床上，两条腿绑到刑床两侧的竖棍上，杨季英面朝天两腿岔开，动弹不得，血臀在刑床上压出了个血印。\n\n侍卫拿来一根短鞭，总共也就小腿长，一半是木把手，另一半是四五根牛皮鞭，每根鞭子都是由三股细牛皮拧在一起，头尾一般粗。“别！不要！！！”没等杨季英说完，侍卫扬起散鞭对着杨季英饱满的荫部抽了下去，散鞭劲道十足，杨季英的整个大唇都凹陷下去，随即反弹充血，留下几道醒目的鞭痕.......“啊！！！”杨季英双目瞪大，青筋直爆，紧接着第二鞭、第三鞭...接踵而至。打完三十鞭，杨季英的荫唇血肿不堪，表面是一粒粒血红的颗粒，乍一看就像荔枝壳。\n\n侍卫又拿出两把夹棍，每把夹棍上直留两根棍，侍卫把两根夹棍分别夹在杨季英两片肿唇上，用力一拉绳......“嗷啊！！！！！”杨季英杀猪一样惨叫一声，眼泪夺眶而出，两片肿大的外唇被挤压成了紫色，侍卫拽着绳子，把杨季英的两片大荫唇左右拉开，露出里面光滑的内唇。“不要啊！！！”杨季英声音颤抖。\n\n“杨将军再忍忍，很快就结束了。”和德光挥挥手示意继续，张廷范和潘县令在一旁爱莫能助。\n\n“飕...啪！”侍卫马不停蹄的抽打起来，鞭子又狠又准，时不时某根鞭梢就能抽到内唇之间的肉缝上，疼得杨季英死去活来，叫的如杀猪一样。\n\n侍卫打完后，和德光迫不及待的走上前，抓住杨季英的荫蒂揉来揉去，杨季英满脸通红，被刺激着扭来扭去，呻吟不停，和德光笑眯眯的说道：“杨将军终究还是女人呐，受不得这般刺激，一下就原形毕露了。”杨季英心神恍惚，没有反驳，只屈辱的闭上眼睛。\n\n和德光趁杨季英神情销魂之际，用力一捏，杨季英疼的猛夹双腿，可惜被绑的结结实实，只有腿上肌肉鼓起，却无法合上。\n\n“哈哈杨将军好腿力，咱们继续吧。”\n\n杨季英从刑床上被解了下来，她捂着羞处，倚在刑床边大口喘起气。\n\n“淫臀五刑第三刑，‘泡红枣’，用檀木短棍敲打臀沟一百。”\n\n“正好杨将军的屁股宽大，不用费劲就能留出臀沟的空隙，宫里有的宫女屁股小，还得人帮忙掰着，有的太监下手黑，不忘宫女屁.眼上翘，专门往人家尾巴骨上敲，打得她们一个多月都弯不下腰，不过杨将军放心，咱们肯定规规矩矩的来。”\n\n杨季英还没缓过劲来，又不得不继续，在侍卫的引导下跪趴到了刑床上，侍卫把杨季英两腿分开绑在刑床两边，又在压腰的木棍上绑好几圈棉被，再次卡到低的洞里，木棍因为绑着棉被变得粗很多，杨季英的腰也被迫压的更低，臀沟也张的更大，加上杨季英本身的胯比较宽，臀沟已经张的有常人的小臂那么宽，黄褐色鼓起的屁.眼甚是醒目。\n\n侍卫拿起一根短的檀木棍，足有擀面杖那么粗，是檀木桌椅剩下的角料做的。\n\n“啪！！”“嘶！！”\n\n檀木棍结结实实的打在杨季英的整条臀沟上，发出炸雷一般的响声，杨季英感觉屁.眼像被针扎了一样疼，整条臀沟都火辣辣的，檀木棍威力不容小觑，杨季英不知道好戏还在后面。“啪！！！啪！！！啪！！！！”侍卫连续敲打着杨季英的臀沟，等到杨季英的臀沟慢慢变肿，尤其是屁.眼上的褶皱都充血肿起后，檀木棍打在上面越来越疼。\n\n“啪！！！”“啊！！！”\n\n杨季英终于受不了了，感觉屁.眼像是被越来越长的针狠狠扎入，连整个肠子都跟着一起痛，臀沟更像是被用蛮力撕开一样，已经不是火辣辣可以概括的。“啊！！！疼！！！！疼！！！！”打到一半，杨季英已经受不了后庭的剧痛，痛苦的哀嚎了起来。\n\n看着痛苦扭动的杨季英，和德光兴奋不已，连连拍手叫好，一旁的张廷范和潘县令也只得随声附和，林婉儿和秦冰凤更是无可奈何，心里替杨季英默默祈祷。\n\n侍卫打完最后一下，杨季英瘫软在刑床上，整条臀沟肿得像一串火红的辣椒，臀沟两壁都渗出血来，沟里的肉都是红紫的颜色，屁.眼肿得像一颗泡开的大红枣。\n\n“‘泡红枣’果然是名不虚传，哈哈哈论对付女人，还是宫里的太监厉害！”和德光看着杨季英火红的臀沟，恨不得立刻扑上去。\n\n“淫臀五刑第四刑，‘金刚杵’，用和驴鞭一样大的木棒...捅进罪女的两洞，来回抽动...每洞各一刻钟。”侍卫有些不好意思。\n\n“哦，听说宫里用的木棒一般是表面不平，有的凿上凸起的疙瘩，有的是螺旋纹，被这金刚杵捅上一捅，下辈子也不敢再做床事了！我听说有的妃子更狠，给木棒表面凿上几排四棱的锥...啧啧，恐怕要把后庭捅烂喽，也不知道会是哪个宫女儿这么倒霉。”\n\n杨季英在一边听着，早已是面色惨白，扑通一下跪地，求和德光饶了她，这样的刑罚是个女人都不愿意承受。\n\n“和大人，末将求你千万不要上金刚杵！”\n\n“哈哈哈，杨将军放宽心，我刚刚所言都是宫里的嘛，咱们就不用那么严格啦，你看看这个行不行？”\n\n说着和德光从衣袋里拿出一根形似阳具的木棒，比一般男人的粗很多，足有小臂长，这是和德光刚才从潘府刑房里的木驴上卸下来的，虽然粗大，但至少表面光滑，不像宫里的凹凸不平。\n\n杨季英看着木棒，脸羞的通红，憋了半天说出两个字：“好...吧”\n\n“哈哈这就好，咱们意思意思，走个形式就行啦！”说罢和德光看向张廷范，张廷范明白这是给他面子，和德光还是会做人的，毕竟以后还会有来往。\n\n“杨季英，还不赶快谢过和大人！”\n\n“谢和大人。”\n\n和德光让杨季英侧躺，他走到杨季英身边，左手一把抬起杨季英的一条腿，扛到肩上，杨季英把脸扭向一边，羞耻不已。和德光右手握着木棒，侍卫拿来油壶，还剩下一半油，和德光把木棒插进去沾满油，把棒头顶住杨季英的荫门，慢慢往里捅......\n\n“唔...嗯...”杨季英羞处红肿，被木棒顶开，疼的嗯哼起来，但更疼的还在后面，和德光把木棒送进去一半多，然后开始往外抽，再往里捅，如此反复抽插......“嘶...”速度越来越快，杨季英的内道慢慢从刺痒感到灼热，木棒又快了一些，杨季英感觉内道越来越热，仿佛钻木取火，快要烧起来了。\n\n“啊...啊！！！疼...慢..慢些！！！”终于疼痛盖过了一些，杨季英感觉内道的肉都随着木棒不停抽动，搅的天翻地覆，和德光听到杨季英呻吟求饶，更加兴奋来劲，速度一下超过了杨季英的承受范围。“啊！！！！！啊！！！！！！！”杨季英大叫起来，木棒仍不依不饶的来回抽动，速度有增无减，杨季英扭动起来，姿势更加妖娆妩媚，慢慢的木棒表面沾了一圈白浆......\n\n和德光猛的往里一捅，木棒直接插进去三分之二，疼的杨季英一阵颤抖，和德光拔出木棒，上面满是白浆，棒头还沾了一点血。随后和德光又让杨季英跪趴起来，把木棒顶入杨季英的屁.眼里，疼的杨季英又是一阵哭喊，一番搅动抽插后把木棒拔了出来，杨季英的屁.眼张开黑漆漆的大洞，久久不能闭合。\n\n“哎呀，杨将军骑马有余，女人的技巧还需要磨练嘛！哈哈哈”和德光看着杨季英张开的屁.眼调侃道，林婉儿和秦冰凤也都看红了脸。\n\n“淫臀五刑最后一刑，‘油泼辣臀’，用宫里特制的蜡块，装在大铁勺里，用火烤成滚烫的蜡油状，浇到罪女的屁股上。”\n\n“哎呀呀，这个可是最精彩的，宫里特质的蜡油比普通蜡烛的蜡油烫多了，而且凉的慢，不易结固，滚烫的蜡油会黏在肉上，甩也甩不掉，非得烫熟块皮不可......这宫里的宫女啊，被这特制蜡烫一烫，臀沟里的皮都得烂掉，第二天还得照常值班做活，又折腾又出汗的......可太惨了，少说也得难受一两个月啊。”\n\n“和大人...”杨季英再次脊背发凉，哆哆嗦嗦的想要求饶。\n\n“哈哈杨将军你也不用害怕，这回咱们用火漆蜡，虽然比普通蜡烛烫些，但比宫里的特制蜡还是好多了，顶多起点泡，蜕点皮，一个月内肯定能好。”\n\n说着侍卫已经拿出大铁勺，在里面放上几块火漆蜡块，然后在火上烤，慢慢的蜡块融化成油，咕嘟咕嘟的冒着泡，热气扑面。\n\n“杨将军请吧？”\n\n杨季英上身伏在刑床上，两颗奶子压成柿饼，双腿跪撑，屁股高高撅起。\n\n“烦请杨将军请把屁股再掰开点。”\n\n杨季英伸出双手掰开自己的两瓣肥臀，和德光从侍卫手里接过铁勺，里面是滚烫的蜡油，和德光举起铁勺，将里面的蜡油全部倒在杨季英后庭……\n\n“啊！！！”杨季英一声惨叫，双手一松，两瓣屁股对撞发出‘啪’的一声，臀沟里满是滚烫的蜡油，杨季英感觉后庭快要熟了一般，又张开臀沟，像让蜡油凉快一些，可惜火漆蜡粘性也比较好，死死粘在杨季英肉上，持续灼烫着臀肉。\n\n过了好一会儿，蜡油才慢慢变成泥状，和德光把蜡油扣下，杨季英的屁.眼边缘的褶皱已经不见，肉孔上生出水泡，臀沟两侧的肉也起了好几个泡，臀沟里的肉由红泛白......接下来的数日杨季英还要押解粮草，恐怕会苦不堪言。\n\n“恭喜杨将军受完了刑，我敬杨将军一杯！”和德光抓起酒杯一饮而尽。杨季英接过一杯酒，不禁苦笑一声，也一饮而尽。此时的杨季英和一个时辰前简直判若两人，屁股皮开肉绽不说，羞处、屁.眼全都伤痕累累，早知道今日要受此大罪，杨季英说什么也不会逞能留下来受罚，秋风吹过，杨季英的心里是万般委屈。\n\n太阳也快下山了，杨季英穿上衣服正想离开，没想到和德光还要拉她陪酒，无奈只好在潘府稍作治疗，就换上了潘夫人的绸缎，继续陪和德光吃晚上的酒席。 晚宴搁在了潘府堂里，屋内灯火通明，一道道美味佳肴摆上桌，还有三位佳人作伴，和德光高兴极了，杨季英的屁股不一会儿又渗出血来，把潘夫人的绸缎染透，潘县令很是豪爽，直接把衣服送给杨季英，和德光还让杨季英起身，掀开她的绸缎品鉴了一番，几人谈笑风生，杨季英忍痛陪笑陪酒，额头上的汗擦了一阵又冒出来一阵，她说什么也不能辜负今天的牺牲。 “我说这淫臀五刑真是个好东西，杨将军以后还敢不敢放纵淫体啊？” “不敢了…末将再也不敢了。” “哈哈哈好，杨将军知错能改，来来来再喝一杯”' 林婉儿和秦冰凤看见杨季英如此低声下气，也都倍加努力的侍候晚宴，怕坏了杨将军的计划。和德光非常满意，还特地赏了屋里屋外忙活的丫鬟，给她们也要了一桌酒席，在外屋吃，夜晚的潘府难得如此热闹，屋里屋外都充满了欢声笑语。", "timestamp": 1659059289, "digest":

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JLc0LhNVU___bg5dk2gu8.jpeg?height=1920&width=3840)\n\n*2022-7-28文章*\n\n## 概括\n\nDecentraland SDK 的新版本正在开发中，以使其更接近最初为该平台设想的理想化 SDK。最终目标是让 Decentraland 的 SDK 成为一个用于创建元宇宙内容的开放协议，对任何其它可能想要采用它的平台开放，并且任何人都可以使用。\n\n目前正在进行的更改将对 Decentraland SDK 的多个维度产生巨大影响。改进的主要类别是：\n\n* **可用性**：使内容创建者的开发更容易，并为添加 Decentraland Editor 铺平道路，这是一个强大的基于视觉的场景构建器（如 Builder），但仍允许完全控制场景的代码。\n* **性能**：让玩家享受更流畅的体验，减少更多的问题，无需依赖创建者进行优化。 \n* **可移植性**：使 SDK 更适应其它引擎/平台。\n\n## 目前的 SDK\n\nDecentraland SDK 的第一个版本是 4 年前由一个团队开发的，该团队的成员在创建软件应用程序方面经验丰富，但从未开发过游戏或游戏平台。因此，需要对 SDK 进行几次不同的迭代才能使其工具更直观，并随着产品的发展而减少限制。在这个过程中，SDK 团队学到了很多东西，整个 Decentraland 基金会团队已经成长为包括许多经验丰富的游戏行业资深人士，他们为 SDK 项目提供了有用的反馈和贡献。\n\nSDK 目前正处于其工具可以创建复杂场景的地步，甚至允许一些创建者以他们的创作为生。但是，这仅适用于经验丰富的开发人员，或者愿意付出大量努力学习如何使用开发人员工具并熟悉高级编程概念的人。我们希望改变这一点，以便任何想要参与的人都可以参与为元宇宙创建内容。\n\n此外，当前可用于创建内容的开发人员工具并不适合用于迭代场景设计和感觉的一些纯视觉工作。例如，通过代码将场景的元素定位到位是碰巧的，而且通常是一个缓慢的过程。最终，SDK 7 的目标是让所有用户群体受益，不仅变得更易于访问，而且整体上更好。\n\n## 主要改进领域\n\nSDK 7 的开发主要围绕三个关键领域的改进：**可用性**、**性能**和**可移植性**。优先考虑这些领域的改进以使 Decentraland 的 SDK 更接近最初为平台设想的理想化版本至关重要。让我们深入了解 SDK 团队计划如何在 SDK 7 中实现这些总体目标。\n\n### 可用性\n\n目前，为 Decentraland 创建内容很困难，这是一个大问题，因为创建者群仅限于经验丰富的开发者，而使得平台错过了其他群体可以提供的所有潜在人才和创造力。拥有源源不断的多样化和令人惊叹的内容对于 Decentraland 的存在至关重要，这就是为什么让*任何人*都更容易使用 SDK 是 SDK 团队最重要的目标之一。\n\n除了降低创建场景的障碍外，创建者还应该在 Decentraland 中构建任何可以想象的东西时获得最佳体验。 Decentraland 基金会对 Decentraland SDK 的愿景是成为创建者喜爱使用的产品。\n\nSDK 7 将通过以下方式提高**可用性**：\n\n* **更简单的多人游戏体验**：制作多人游戏 Decentraland 场景是创建者至今遇到的最艰巨的挑战之一。结果造成大多数内容创建者只创建单人游戏体验，这是很可惜的，因为元宇宙​​旨在成为与他人会面的社交空间。 为了更轻松地创建多人游戏体验，SDK 7 旨在通过网络同步更改，实施复杂的无冲突复制算法。这将是一种默认行为，因此创建者无需弄清楚如何执行此操作。除了启用多人游戏体验外，此功能还将允许场景在服务器中存储持久的场景状态。例如，如果玩家打开一扇门然后离开，服务器会记住门是开着的，后来进来的玩家应该也会发现它是开着的。 \n* **可扩展的复杂性**：在设计任何工具时，几乎每一个决定都会反复出现权衡：您要么追求更易于使用，要么追求灵活性和范围更广。工具的范围越小，复杂性就可以隐藏在假设背后并远离用户视线。但如前所述，创建者应该能够在 Decentraland 中构建任何可以想象的东西，因此限制 SDK 的功能不是一种选择。因此，使 SDK 可供所有人访问但仍然能够构建任何东西的明显解决方案是在复杂层中设计 SDK 的 UX。该计划是实施默认设置，提供一条简单的路径，但如果创建者想亲自动手，他们也可以选择进入幕后。\n* **开箱即用的游戏服务器**：新的架构设计和协议将使创建者更容易运行游戏服务器。该方法遵循在服务器和客户端之间共享代码的行业标准，在服务器中运行与在每个玩家实例中相同的模拟，并保证实体的同步。这些游戏服务器可以是无需信任的，也可以是权威的，这取决于场景的需要。 \n* **为 Decentraland 编辑器铺平道路**：这将是一个具有可视化界面（如 Builder）和代码编辑功能的一体化内容创建工具。这最终将成为技术和非技术创建者的首选工具，并将成为将非开发者用户带入为 Decentraland 创建场景的世界的游戏规则改变者。使用 Decentraland 编辑器，创建者不需要处理任何开发工具，如命令行、Node、Visual Studio Code、GitHub 等，如果他们无此意愿。这个单一工具将在一个地方提供创建者可能需要的所有内容，并将总体上改善创作体验。例如，调整 3D 对象的位置将成为一项直观的视觉任务，但编写描述系统行为的代码的选项仍然存在。 查看所有现有的可视化编辑器（Builder、DCL Edit、VR Bylder），没有一个可以在编辑模式下从 SDK 代码运行场景。相反，它们会跟踪某些模式中每个项目的位置，并且仅在预览或导出时按需生成 SDK 代码。这种方法有很多局限性。 Decentraland 编辑器将能够在每种模式下运行场景，进一步增强用户体验。\n*  **新的文档平台**：当前的 Decentraland 文档平台仅显示与 SDK 最新版本相关的信息。它不是一个完美的系统，因为它不一定是每个人都使用的版本。由于对 SDK 7 的更改将包含重大更改，并且每个人都可能不会立即加入，因此支持旧版本的 SDK 比以往任何时候都更加重要。除了支持内容版本控制，新的文档平台还将托管 Decentraland 协议的技术文档，针对代码贡献者。\n\n### 性能\n\nDecentraland 提出了一些独特的开发挑战，首先是 3D 虚拟世界需要在浏览器上运行，这不会给低效率留下太多空间。此外，由于场景是相邻渲染的，因此表现不佳的场景不仅会受到影响，还会拖累周围的所有场景。因此，SDK 不应依赖所有创建者来开发完美高效的场景，而应该拥有能够带来轻量级和优化内容的工具，即使创建者没有考虑这方面。\n\nSDK 7 将通过以下方式提高**性能**：\n\n* **静态场景**：使用 SDK 7 构建的场景只会在用户远离时加载场景的主要 3D 模型（或它们的低分辨率版本），并在用户靠近时等待加载动态内容。这确实有助于优化世界，因为这意味着玩家将能够体验更大的可见区域，感觉更像是一个连续的世界，同时不需要平台实际运行所有可见的代码。 \n* **新数据流**：在 SDK 7 中，将场景与渲染器连接起来的消息传递协议将得到优化，不仅是轻量级的，而且还具有能够根据需要缓存/过滤/重新分发信息的中间件。例如，静态场景可以被认为是存储在文件中的简单“协议的缓存消息”；当用户远离场景时，渲染器可以预加载文件，而无需下载和执行实际代码。然后，当用户走近场景时，使用存储在服务器中的最后一个状态加载代码，该状态也可以被缓存。\n* **新的通信技术**：当前的 P2P 架构在服务器和基础设施方面非常分散且轻量级，但事实证明，它不足以满足第一人称射击游戏和其它竞技游戏所需的近实时交互。 SDK 7 将默认实现当前的 P2P 网络模式，但它也将为通信技术的即时切换打开大门。内容创建者将能够自己处理玩家之间的配对，甚至建立私人联系。由于内容创建者将能够插入与界面匹配的任何技术，他们将能够使用更快（更集中）的通信技术。\n\n### 可移植性\n\nDecentraland 的参考渲染器基于 Unity 构建，但 Decentraland 基金会的使命始终是成为一个任何人都可以自由扩展的开放平台。这意味着有一天，可能会出现使用其它引擎的替代社区构建客户端，从而使 Decentraland 可供玩家使用各种硬件类型等等。\n\n今天，SDK 和渲染器以某种方式深深地交织在一起，这使得构建替代渲染器变得非常困难。然而，在 SDK 7 的开发过程中，团队将迈出第一步，以更接近重新定义 SDK 和 Decentraland 运行引擎之间的接口。一旦完成，SDK 7 将围绕具有清晰文档的简洁模块化架构构建，如果一切顺利，将可以相对轻松地将其插入其它引擎。\n\nSDK 7 将通过以下方式提高**可移植性**：\n\n* **通用性**：SDK 7 的设计方式将来应该可以在受限甚至远程环境中使用。这可能包括移动设备和可以嵌入移动设备或渲染引擎的自定义轻量级 JS 运行时。 \n* **标准化协议**：从场景代码到渲染器，每个组件都将被重新审视，以确保新协议得到优化并有据可查。目标不仅是重新实现每个组件以遵循新系统，而且还使未来的系统能够建立在现有系统之上。换句话说，*正式化 Decentraland 协议*。 \n* **欢迎新分支**：一旦 *Decentraland 协议*正式化并记录在案，新的贡献者将能够使用 Godot、Unreal、独立 VR 和自定义引擎或平台等替代技术创建自己的 Decentraland 版本。\n\n### SDK 7 路线图\n\n以下是 SDK 7 发布前后设定的里程碑：\n\n2022年9月：软启动 SDK 7 beta 以收集反馈和测试功能（首先是朋友和家人，然后是整个社区）。\n\n2022年10月：启动与 SDK 6 特性相同的 SDK 7 功能，包括文档和示例。\n\n2022年11月：完成有关内部协议的 SDK 7 文档并建立 Decentraland 协议 1.0，以作为新技术（Godot、Unreal、独立 VR、自定义引擎或平台等）的新客户参考。\n\n2022第四季度：创建一个适配器，自动将 SDK 6 场景的内部消息转换为 SDK 7 使用的更优化的协议，而无需部署场景的内容创建者执行任何操作。\n\n2023第一季度：发布 Decentraland Editor 的第一个版本（用户对象：SDK 开发人员），该版本将是嵌入 SDK 7 的辅助工具，用于本地开发。\n\n2023第二季度：发布 Decentraland Editor 的第二个版本（用户对象：非技术内容创建者）。此版本将取代 Builder。可以通过网络访问，并且可以使用服务器来存储项目。\n\n2023第三季度：发布第三版 Decentraland Editor（用户角色：所有人）。此版本将整合代码和非代码用户以实现渐进式学习曲线。它还将包括支持新组件和系统经济的 NFT 系统。\n\n*SDK 产品过程完全发生在开源 GitHub 议题中。由于透明度是 Decentraland 基金会的核心价值，因此整个 SDK 的规划和组织过程都可以在 GitHub 上获得，供社区参与和审核。*\n\n**选择您常用的频道加入与我们联系，关注Decentraland(MANA)的最新动态**\n\n**DCL基金会全球社区： \n 【[Official Website](https://decentraland.org/)**】 \n

Chain）合并。整个以太坊网络将继承原来主网的交易状态，信标链会被合并进去作为共识层。合并后最直观的改变就是以太坊的共识机制从PoW变成PoS。\n\n合并前是PoW（工作量证明）机制。节点暴力计算，争夺出块权，获得收益。在这个过程中，为了确保网络安全，需要有较高比例的节点存储所有（或者大部分）数据，每个节点都要参与交易验证。节点被无差别对待，所有交易也被无差别处理。\n\n合并后是PoS（权益证明）机制。出块节点（提案人，Proposer）和验证节点（验证委员会，Committee）被随机选出。等到合并后的下一个阶段“数据分片”实现，不同节点可以各自只存储部分数据，验证也只由被选出的Committee负责进行。\n\n这实际上降低了节点门槛，也减轻了以太坊的数据存储压力（不必永久存储所有数据），是通过优化主网运行规则来扩容。需要注意的是，PoS并不能带来扩容，扩容依赖于分片的实现。\n\n**·为分片做准备**\n\n\\*\\*以太坊网络之所以转变为PoS是为了分片做准备。\\*\\*实际上PoS和分片的组合在官方文件中获得了认可。以太坊官网中写道“信标链（PoS）将处理/协调分片和质押人网络。”\n\n笔者认为，合并的终极目标是扩容，扩容要通过分片+Rollup实现，为了分片，以太坊网络需要先转变为PoS，因为PoS和分片在逻辑上更为一致。PoW考虑全局性，而PoS和分片则都用到“随机数”的元素，它们都追求“最小的充分性和必要性”，减少存储/验证冗余。\n\n其次才是为众人称道的环境更友好，以及更高的安全性和去中心化程度。\n\n**·PoS对环境更友好**\n\nPoW网络出块是算力竞争，这种竞争对机器、电力提出越来越高的要求。以最典型的PoW网络——比特币为例，根据剑桥大学此前的数据，比特币网络一年的耗电量大约是1213.6亿度，超过阿根廷、荷兰、阿拉伯联合酋长国全年耗电量。\n\n虽然以太坊的耗电量远低于比特币，但是作为一个新兴科技领域的代表，它也在追求变得更加环境友好。\n\n据了解，合并之后，以太坊网络的耗电量将减少99%以上。10万次Visa交易大概消耗149度电，相比之下，合并后的PoS以太坊网络进行10万次交易只消耗0.667度电。\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/zJrC2WF3G4.png)\n\n把耗电量类比成高度，数据和图片引用自：海外独角兽\n\n**·安全性和去中心化程度**\n\n至于网络安全性和去中心化程度，Vitalik曾讨论过他认为PoS相对于PoW更具优势的原因。\n\n整体而言，PoS节点的参与门槛更低。比特币PoW节点间的竞争已经“进化”到ASIC，除了资金外还有机器搭建、运维门槛，普通人无法参与。\n\nPoS网络无法拒绝任何人成为节点（或者节点的一部分）。虽然32 ETH现在意味着4.5万美元左右的高资金门槛，但是已经有越来越多的服务商支持小额ETH质押，PoS在机器、操作上的门槛也更低。\n\n此外，根据Vitalik给出的一些数据，PoS网络的攻击成本高于PoW网络。在被攻击后，PoS的恢复能力也优于PoW网络。（后文会有介绍）\n\n在广受争议的PoS导致富者更富问题上，因为PoS支持的参与群体更广泛，节点的质押+Gas收入会被分摊（相当于以小节点的数量优势减缓巨鲸财富增长）。Vitalik认为，以太坊转成PoS后，财富集中程度的翻倍可能要花一个世纪，在这个过程中，ETH的重新分配，如消费、慈善捐赠，也会减缓财富集中趋势。\n\n目前来看，PoW和PoS的安全性和去中心化程度到底孰优孰劣还没有定论。\n\n### **合并前后的信标链**\n\n基于上述原因，以太坊确定了分片+Rollups+PoS的未来发展路径。\n\n作为发展路径的第一步，信标链和现行以太坊主网的合并已经提上日程。合并预计在9月19日前后进行。\n\n**·合并前**\n\n就好像空间站（以太坊主网）要增加新的模块（信标链），飞船（信标链）要提前为对接（合并）做准备，信标链的准备工作至少开始于2020年12月1日。\n\n2020年12月1日，以太坊推出信标链，从推出之日起至今，信标链一直与以太坊主网并行运行，彼此独立。\n\n信标链是一条PoS链，负责出块的提议者（Proposers）和负责交易验证的验证委员会（Committee）从质押ETH的验证者中随机选出。\n\n所以从上线的第一天开始，信标链就支持了ETH质押/存储功能，通过质押32个或更多ETH，你能成为验证者，获得质押利息。目前ETH的存入还是一个单向的过程，ETH和利息的提取要等到合并后的上海升级之后。\n\n现在信标链除了质押ETH，随机选择节点出块和验证，对节点进行奖励和惩罚，维持网络正常运行之外，没有其他功能，目前它不支持账户和智能合约。\n\n相比之下，现在的以太坊主网则是一条承载着成千上万应用，数千亿美元链上资金，以及要同时承担共识、数据可用、交易执行三个功能的PoW链。\n\n**·合并后**\n\n**等到信标链合并到以太坊主网，以太坊的PoW共识层将被替换成信标链（PoS），交易状态则是继承自原以太坊主网。**\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/w9e7RGpwG2.png)\n\n来源：Danny Ryan\n\n信标链将协调质押网络，类似于一个中枢记账本，记录验证者名单，对验证者进行奖励和惩罚，合并后信标链成为以太坊整体的一部分，应该也会同时承担交易执行、数据可用的职责。在分片实现后，信标链还将协调分片网络。\n\n从当前的规划来看，以太坊未来的发展路径是想要通过优化主网共识（PoS），优化数据存储/验证效率来提高主网性能，同时外接“假肢”——Rollup，交易执行主要向Rollup拓展。\n\n因此，整个过程可以看做是向Rollup承接以太坊交易执行层，以太坊Layer1作为更高效的数据有效层和共识层过渡。未来的发展不排除这种情况：以太坊Layer1退居幕后，Rollup成为交易执行的高可扩展性机器，以太坊Layer1为Rollup数据有效性和共识提供保障。\n\n为了推动共识机制从PoW向PoS转变，以太坊还设置了“难度炸弹”。“难度炸弹”会使PoW计算难度指数上升，从而劝退矿工，确保以太坊在合并后成为“纯粹”的PoS链。对于矿工群体，已经有人预测以太坊分叉的可能。\n\n### **合并现状**\n\n以太坊的合并需要由代码变动来实现。尽管合并以“最小破坏”为原则，但是因为牵扯到大量的应用和资金，这一过程必须谨慎。节点和DApp开发者可以根据https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/提示进行操作。\n\n在主网合并前，以太坊分别在Kiln、Ropsten、Sepoli、Goerli测试网上进行合并测试。目前Kiln、Ropsten、Sepoli已经成功过渡到PoS。Goerli的合并预计在8月11日进行。\n\n由于Goerli是最接近以太坊主网的测试网，Goerli合并测试比较重要。这之前将分别在Goerli、主网上进行影子分叉测试。影子分叉是合并的试运行，此前的影子分叉中不是没有问题。\n\n再考虑到测试网合并并不是真正的以太坊主网合并。以太坊主网上运行着数千个节点、55万多个代币智能合约、数以万计的DeFi、NFT应用，相比之下，测试网中的应用和资金要轻便许多，**以太坊主网的合并复杂度远超测试网。**\n\n**再加上以太坊的合并已经经历过多次延期。江卓尔也表示，还有大量的应用没有开始测试合并。因此，我们对9月19日能否如期合并不抱乐观态度。**\n\n在信标链方面，目前验证者数量已经超过41万个，ETH质押数量超过1310万个，占到总供应量的约11%。从上线至今，信标链一直稳定运行，信标链已经为合并做好准备。\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/R11UY38H0K.png)\n\n信标链现状，来源：beaconcha.in\n\n### **合并前后5大维度数据对比**\n\n合并前后，以太坊网络会出现一些变化。哔哔News将从去中心化程度、安全性、节点收入、代币供应、合规风险5个维度进行对比和说明。\n\n**·去中心化程度**\n\n合并前，以太坊活跃节点数量维持在数千个，高峰期曾达到12569个（目前活跃节点处在数百个的低谷期）。这些节点分布在全球各地。无论是从数量还是地理分布上看，PoW的以太坊网络去中心化程度已经很高。\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/m7Su2OOPjw.png)\n\n以太坊PoW节点分布，来源：etherscan.io/nodetracker\n\n相比之下，未来将接棒PoW的信标链验证者数量更多。目前信标链验证者（质押32 ETH的客户端）超过41万个。\n\n需要注意的是PoW网络中的节点区分大小，不同的节点算力水平不一样，而信标链中每个验证者背后都质押了32 ETH，份额相同，没有差异。可能存在大量验证者由同一个巨鲸掌控的情况。所以仅从节点数量进行对比无法完全说明问题。\n\n当我们比较去中心化程度时，我们也该考虑网络的参与门槛。尽管以太坊PoW的竞争还主要停留在GPU阶段，但是合并后，参与门槛有望降低。\n\nPoW时代，要参与以太坊网络，你需要有专门的机器，并且机器成本不低，机器还在经历着持续的迭代。PoS时代，以太坊网络对于机器、机器操作和维护的要求都有所降低。用户也可以直接通过质押服务商以小额ETH参与质押，能进一步免除机器配置、运维上的麻烦。\n\n**所以，以太坊合并后支持的参与群体会比PoW更加广泛，你只要有ETH就可以参与。**\n\nPoS可能会带来财富集中问题，这是很多人对以太坊合并存疑的一个重要原因。事实上，任何系统都无法阻止资源、财富的集中倾向。\n\n考虑到以太坊的参与群体更为广泛，并且质押的代币可收回有利息，相比于机器折旧和淘汰，参与者更愿意在质押中投入成本。“小节点”的数量和持续参与能缓解巨鲸财富增长的速度。Vitalik认为以太坊网络的财富集中程度翻倍可能需要一个世纪的时间长度。\n\n**但无可否认的是，PoS的以太坊网络对于巨鲸而言确实没有门槛，他们的财富优势将得到最大程度的发挥。**\n\n**·安全性**\n\n在安全性方面，Vitalik曾发文论证合并后的以太坊网络更加安全。论证从攻击成本、攻击后恢复难易程度进行说明。\n\n**1）攻击成本**\n\n假设网络每天有$1的区块奖励，攻击此网络所需的成本是多少？\n\n**基于GPU的PoW网络**\n\n你可以租到便宜的GPU，所以攻击网络的成本就只是租到足够的GPU算力以超过现有的矿工。每产生$1的区块奖励，现有矿工的成本将接近$1 (如果成本高于$1，矿工会因为无利可图而退出，反之新矿工就会加入进来)。因此，攻击网络的成本只需要高于$1/天，而且可能只需要持续几个小时。\n\n总攻击成本：**\\~$0.26**（假设攻击6小时，攻击成本为>$1/24\\*6），且因为攻击者可以收到区块奖励，这个数字还有可能压到零。\n\n**基于ASIC的PoW网络**\n\nASIC其实是资本成本：当买进ASIC时，你预期大概可以用两年，因为它会慢慢耗损或是被性能更好的硬件取代。如果一个链被51%攻击了，社群可能会更换PoW算法来做出应对，而这时你的ASIC就会失去价值。平均而言，PoW节点成本约为1/3的经常性成本和2/3的资本成本。\n\n因此，每$1的区块奖励上，PoW节点每天会花\\~$0.33在电力与维护上，\\~$0.67在ASIC上。假设ASIC可以用大约2年，矿工会需要为单位ASIC硬件花费 $486.67。($486.67= 365天 x 2 x $0.67）\n\n总攻击成本：$486.67 (ASIC) + $0.08 (电力与维护，0.33/24\\*6) = $486.75\n\n**PoS网络**\n\n权益证明的成本几乎是百分百的资本成本（质押的币）。唯一的营运成本是运行节点的成本。和ASIC不同的是，质押的币不会贬值，而且当你不想质押了你还可以在一段短时间内取回质押金。因此，参与者应该会愿意为同样程度的奖励付出比ASIC的情况更高的资本成本。\n\n让我们假设\\~15%的质押利率足够吸引人们质押 (这是ETH合并后的期望APR)。因此每天$1的区块奖励会吸引相当于6.667年资金（$1 / (15%/年）的抵押，换算为金额为$2,433（$1/天 x 365 x 6.667）。\n\n节点消耗的硬件与电力成本很小，每一千元的电脑可以抵押成千上万的资产，而且每月\\~$100 的电力与网费也算足够。但保守来说，我们假设这些经常性成本是抵押总成本的 \\~10%。所以我们只有每天$0.90的区块奖励对应到资本成本，因此我们还要把上面的数字减少\\~10%。\n\n总攻击成本：90% \\* $2,433（资本成本）+$0.10/24\\*6（电力）= $2,189\n\n笔者补充：PoW网络中要实现攻击，需要满足>50%算力，以太坊合并后的PoS网络中，根据一些人分析，1/3的质押份额是一个比较重要的安全阈值。在这种情况下，0.26/2<486.75/2<2189/3。\n\n**从计算结果来看，PoS的以太坊网络的攻击成本高于PoW的以太坊网络。这种反脆弱性来自于市场对以太坊的信心（以太坊不太可能变得一文不值）。**\n\n**相比于机器会折旧和淘汰，质押的币不会损耗，反而会生息，尤其是在质押资产有升值预期的情况下。这激励更多普通用户参与。市场的参与越是去中心化，质押的资金越多，撬动以太坊网络所需的资金成本就越是高昂。**\n\n**2）更容易从攻击中恢复**\n\n在攻击恢复层面，Vitalik认为，PoS网络的恢复能力强于PoW网络。\n\n对于GPU维护的PoW网络，一旦被攻破后，网络几乎没有抵抗和恢复能力。\n\n对于ASIC维护的PoW网络，社群能够应对第一波攻击，通过硬分叉来更改PoW算法。但同时，所有机器（包括攻击者和诚实节点的ASIC）都将变得毫无价值。因为没有足够的时间去为新算法创造新的ASIC，攻击和抵抗情境又将回到GPU的情况（笔者注：因攻击者和诚实节点回到同一起跑线，情况会比攻击者在有准备的情况下攻击GPU网络好一些）。攻击者可以攻击再攻击，使网络无法恢复。\n\n相比之下，在PoS网络中，对于某些51%攻击（特别指想要推翻已经敲定的区块的攻击），PoS网络有内设的罚没（slashing）机制，攻击者在攻击的同时会受到重创。对于更难侦测的攻击（特别指51%合谋截断他人信息的攻击），也有办法削弱攻击者。但如前文所述，确保攻击者质押份额<1/3是比较重要的安全阈值。\n\n**·ETH供应和节点收入**\n\n现在市场对于以太坊合并最兴奋的叙事莫过于“减产”。合并后ETH产量将减少；EIP-1559烧毁Base Gas费；用户被鼓励质押ETH，使得ETH的流通量降低。这些因素有比较大的可能使以太坊进入通缩时代。\n\n**ETH的通胀/通缩情况取决于2个要素，分别是ETH的年产量（新增量）和ETH作为Base Gas每年被燃烧的量（销毁量）。**\n\nETH的产量来自2部分，分别是出块奖励和信标链上ETH的质押奖励。合并前出块奖励归矿工所有，平均每13.3秒产出2.08 ETH，这样一年下来的出块奖励大约为493万ETH。合并后，出块奖励将被取消。\n\n至于ETH质押奖励，目前总共有约1300万ETH被质押，一年释放大约58.4万ETH作为质押奖励。合并前后，质押奖励都分配给信标链上的验证者。\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/LfJs9ChL5i.jpg)\n\n质押奖励取决于总质押量和APR，APR逐渐降低 来源：Ultrasound.money\n\n现在ETH的总供应量是1.197亿，所以合并前，以太坊年产量占总供应量的（493+58.4）/11970=4.6%，合并后，这个数据变为58.4/11970=0.49%。合并导致ETH减产89.4%。\n\nETH销毁方面，根据Watchtheburn.com数据，每天销毁的Base Gas费持续波动。自EIP-1559生效（2021年9月27日）以来，不到1年的时间，已经销毁超255万ETH。\n\n255万ETH>58.4万ETH，**可见合并后，除非ETH质押量剧增，否则质押释放的ETH奖励远不足以覆盖Gas燃烧销毁。以太坊在合并后极有可能进入通缩时代。**\n\n再加上质押激励（已经有人将ETH称为“链上国债”，因为收益稳健，用户愿意参与，目前已经有11%的ETH被质押到信标链），ETH的市场流通量应该会处于较低水平，这些都是价格提振因素。\n\n但同时，笔者也认为，**对于一个“应用货币”而言，通缩模型因为不足以满足缓慢增长的使用需求，长期来看并不可持续。（不作为投资建议）**\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/B0cxbT7YZ2.png)\n\nBase Gas燃烧情况，平均每天燃烧>3000 ETH，来源：watchtheburn.com\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/BTj6qnWf8w.png)\n\n来源：哔哔News\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/Fo27cA11dX.png)\n\nETH供应曲线模拟 来源：Ultrasound.money\n\n合并前后，由于ETH释放和分配情况调整，验证者将接手原矿工的部分收入，验证者的年收益率将从4.6%上升到9.2%。\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/43M5fX6L10.png)\n\n来源：Ultrasound.money\n\n**·合规风险**\n\n以太坊是继比特币之后最接近“商品”概念的虚拟资产，但合并可能会改变这一形象。CFTC前主席Heath P. Tarbert就曾暗示“在以PoS作为共识机制的区块链上，那些用做抵押的代币将很可能会被视为证券商品”。\n\nStake.fish 在《2021 年质押生态系统报告》中也曾分析到“由于质押在某种意义上看起来像固定收益，这可能会招致监管者认为验证者比矿工更接近于金融实体。如果发生这种情况，那么验证者将没有办法保持合规”。\n\n所以整体来看，合并很可能在去中心化、安全性、节点收入、ETH供应上为以太坊带来优化，但合规是潜在的达摩克里斯之剑。\n\n### **Staking成新红利赛道**\n\n随着以太坊合并进入倒计时，Staking赛道获得了前所未有的关注。\n\n直接质押ETH存在3个问题，一是金额门槛要达到32 ETH或更多，二是质押金和利息无法立刻取出，导致很高的机会成本，三是存在节点运营门槛。质押服务商（Staking as a Service，STaaS）是连接普通用户和信标链的纽带，使普通用户也能参与。\n\nSTaaS解决了上述3个核心问题：资金门槛、资金流动性、节点运营。STaaS把用户资金聚集起来，每凑足32 ETH就能作为一个运营者加入网络。\n\nSTaaS在收到用户资金的同时，向用户发放对应数量的xETH衍生品，作为赎回ETH和生息的凭证，这些xETH可以在二级市场流通，从而释放用户“押金”的流动性，把机会成本降到0。xETH也能参与DeFi乐高，提高资本效率。\n\n有的STaaS自己运行节点，有的则是把用户的ETH质押需求和节点运营商的节点运营能力匹配起来，让普通用户省去节点配置、运行、维护的麻烦。\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/nJCul00sf3.jpg)\n\n来源：哔哔News\n\n**整体来看，这个市场头部效应明显。**\n\n从用户数量和ETH质押量的角度来看，Lido是绝对的头部。Kraken、Binance等CEX因为离用户最近，并且易于操作，也占据了不少的份额。其次是像Stakefish、Figment这样的专业质押服务商。在去中心化质押流动池方面，Rocket Pool的数据也靠前。\n\n\\*\\*因为操作、功能同质化严重，所以STaaS相互间的竞争激烈。\\*\\*大部分此类平台把资金门槛降到0.1 ETH（有的甚至没有资金限制），对应的服务费占比基本稳定在10-15%的水平。在这些平台上，用户的操作也大同小异。\n\nLido成为头部主要得益于两点，一是品牌效应，二是衍生品stETH的交易深度。Lido和Curve等DeFi应用建立了深度关系。现在Curve上的ETH/stETH池子有12亿美元的流动性，为用户换手stETH提供了充分的交易深度。\n\n但是这些还不能作为Lido绝对的护城河。例如stETH在近期黑天鹅事件中就曾出现价格脱锚。Lido也被质疑会为以太坊带来中心化风险。目前还没有任何一家STaaS具备绝对的差异化优势。用户仍然可以舍弃一家STaaS而选择另一家，几乎没有阻力。\n\n**从根本的需求来看，STaaS间的竞争将围绕用户体验（操作便捷程度）、资金门槛、服务收费、去中心化程度（安全程度）、xETH交易深度等综合维度展开。**\n\n![以太坊合并前后变化有多大？5大维度数据告诉你](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/panews/2022/07/26/images/HRbxZuwCUu.png)\n\n来源：国盛证券\n\n**从短期来看，以太坊合并事件为质押赛道带来发展红利。从长期来看，STaaS发展的最主要凭借是公链生态繁荣，以及赛道本身的创新。**\n\n赛道本身的创新可能会来自2个方面，一是xETH衍生品，这里将同时蕴含脱锚风险和DeFi可组合潜力；二是STaaS机制的创新。\n\nRocket Pool和SSVNetwork是哔哔News目前看到机制比较创新的STaaS。\n\nRocket Pool平台通过“撮合”节点运营商和用户来提供服务。与Lido通过DAO筛选节点运营商不同，任何节点运营商都可以在Rocket Pool上创建迷你池。\n\n他们只需要质押16 ETH和价值1.6ETH的平台代币RPL。剩余的16 ETH，Rocket Pool会从用户端“凑齐”。当节点出现罚没（slashing）时，节点运营商的ETH会被优先扣除。RPL会被出售兑换ETH，来补充节点运营商的ETH。\n\n对于每个节点运营商而言，他们聚集的用户资金上限是16 ETH。这虽然带来可拓展性的限制，但是却能带来很好的去中心化效果。\n\nSSV Network则采用了去中心化验证者技术（Decentralized Validator Technology, DVT）。用户质押涉及到2种私钥，分别是取款私钥和验证者签名私钥，其中验证者签名私钥需要不断地进行签名，离线或者恶意行为会造成罚款，所以当用户委托节点运营商或者流动性服务提供商质押ETH时，需要把验证者签名私钥给对方。\n\n通过DVT，用户可以把验证者签名私钥加密后分成多份，分配给不同的节点运营商。这种情况下，当有小部分节点运营商离线或者有恶意行为时，整个验证结果不会受到影响，ETH不会被罚没。这也将带来更加去中心化的以太坊网络。这种思路也可以被应用到其他有Slashing机制的PoS网络。\n\n**参考文章：**\n\n《以太坊创始人Vitalik详解：POS安全性优于POW的三点关键因素》by 链得得\n\n《以太坊在合并后将面临哪些潜在的中心化风险？》by TJ Keel\n\n《以太坊转PoS在即：Staking赛道及代表项目深度解析》by Mint Ventures\n\n《区块链行业大转换——以太坊合并，从显卡跌价说起》by 国盛证券\n\n注：本文不作为投资建议", "timestamp": 1659060206, "digest": "TF7RbyrYlBuGU9_LMRFC6DwkHp26gPU2_j3Ol7igBXI", "contributor": "0x5ac4753fC52A1c5Dd4E5d98e9aBd11f8A63dC7D6"}

The UK also gives the ok to [sue from the blockchain](https://time.com/6196582/court-nft-litigation-blockchain/).\n\n**MY TAKE:** With NFTs effectively gaining the status of legal documentation this is big news. With wallets still so new to so many, this will be an interesting way to serve notices. Don’t want to split your crypto 50/50 during a divorce? Check your wallet for those papers, you may have just been served!\n\n**Disney’s accelerator program goes big on web3 companies**\n\n‘To empower innovative collaborations with the Walt Disney Company’ is [the mission](https://sites.disney.com/accelerator/faq/) of the Accelerator program. This time round [six web3 companies](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/2022-disney-accelerator-participants-announced/) made the cut and they offer an incredible mix of capabilities across augmented reality, NFTs, and AI.\n\n**MY TAKE:** This is killer signal that the worlds best storytellers are cooking up some exciting experiences to say the least. Where’s those imagineers? With in-person attendance at parks and events ‘almost’ back to normal expect impressive experiences across location-based and virtual with ties to more modern views of 21st century loyalty using NFTs.\n\n**Chipotle launches ‘Buy the Dip’ for National Avocado Day offering 200k in crypto.**\n\n‘The market never sleeps but we do’ says the scrolling banner at [chipotlebuythedip.xyz](https://www.chipotlebuythedip.xyz/) pointing to the next play starting at 1p ET today. The game runs for a few more days to 7/31 on National Avocado Day. They’re giving out out crypto prizes to over 500 players in cash value from $1250 to $35k awarded in Bitcoin, Eth, Dogecoin etc deposited to verified Coinbase accounts. There’s also free food vouchers to 700,000 others.“We want to build the next generation of Chipotle fandom by connecting with the Web3 community,” Chris Brandt, Chipotle’s CMO said.\n\n**MY TAKE**: Although without an NFT drop yet (despite much pressure from [influencers](https://twitter.com/NicoleBehnam/status/1513640196125777921?s=20&t=UwEnvhn2incI8mS2MK5qYQ)), Chipotle is making big moves into web3: last month they [started accepting crypto](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/chipotle-now-accepts-cryptocurrency-payment) as payment at nearly all 3,000 US stores, they launched their [second metaverse](https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2022-04-05-FANS-CAN-ROLL-BURRITOS-AT-CHIPOTLE-IN-THE-METAVERSE-TO-EARN-BURRITOS-IN-REAL-LIFE) experience in [Roblox with the Burrito Builder](https://www.roblox.com/games/7603178367/Chipotle-Burrito-Builder), and now they’re giving away crypto with the ‘Buy the Dip’ promo. Love this cheeky play on the phrase ‘buy the dip’. The phrase originates from when crypto stocks are low many suggest it being the right time to buy in. Keep going, Chipotle, and let us know what you’re learning from these projects.\n\nA reminder to big brands on how to prepare for web3: start accepting crypto like many are, buy some NFTs to work the muscle and set a strategic path.

In her role as Secretary of State for International Trade, the MP [launched](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/liz-truss-launches-future-trade-strategy-for-uk-tech-industry) a digital trade network in 2020 whose measures included promoting fintech firms that “enable\\[d\\] digitisation and resilience in priority export markets.”\n\n***Related: [Majority of British crypto owners revealed to be hodlers: Survey](https://cointelegraph.com/news/majority-of-british-crypto-owners-revealed-to-be-hodlers-survey)***\n\nAmid Johnson’s expected departure, policy decisions have continued to move forward in the United Kingdom. Nadhim Zahawi, who replaced Sunak as chancellor of the Exchequer, [introduced a Financial Services and Markets Bill](https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-financial-markets-bill-authorizes-regulation-of-stablecoins-service-providers) on July 20, which contained a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The Treasury Committee of the House of Commons also [opened an inquiry allowing U.K. residents](https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-treasury-committee-opens-inquiry-into-crypto-industry) to write in about the role of crypto assets in the country.\n\nThe Conservative Party is expected to decide between Sunak and Truss as the next leader by Sept. 5, at which point Johnson will officially step down. On Tuesday, the two candidates took part in a televised debate that was cut short after moderator Kate McCann [fainted](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/26/sunak-and-truss-debate-abandoned-after-host-faints) while on air.", "timestamp": 1659060593, "digest": "eSQFKqTQg2Ue5kEgJIYwCeD2CPhcn9AWZbi0H2-378o", "contributor": "0x43BB172927116E0E5713A957A581E621762AEe2C"}

The Merge (合并) 阶段**\n\n合并是指以太坊执行层 (当前的以太坊主网) 与信标链 (新的 POS 层) 的合并。\n\n对以太坊而言，这意味着：\n\n1\\. ETH 成为通缩性资产 (发行减少量)；\n\n2\\. 减少了 99% 的能源消耗。\n\n本次升级目前暂定 2022年9月19日。\n\n**02. The Surge 阶段 (2023)**\n\n本阶段指在以太坊上引入分片 (Sharding)。\n\n分片是将以太坊区块链的整个网络分成更小的分区 (称为“分片链”)。这将显著提高以太坊网络的可扩展性。\n\n![Vitalik在ETHCC的演讲：以太坊发展路线图和长期未来的思考](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com//panews/2022/7/23/images/c6fb1330d4d2c63a379fd4adb88bd88b.png)\n\n**03. The Verge 阶段**\n\n本阶段将引入 Verkle 树，这是“对 Merkle 证明的强大升级，允许实现更小的证明大小 (proof sizes)”。\n\n这将优化以太坊上的存储，并有助于减少节点大小。最终，这将帮助以太坊变得更具可扩展性。\n\n![Vitalik在ETHCC的演讲：以太坊发展路线图和长期未来的思考](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com//panews/2022/7/23/images/fca0c50566950857bcc0272469ac758d.png)\n\n**04. The Purge 阶段**\n\n本阶段将减少验证者所需的硬盘空间，这将通过剔除历史数据和消除技术债务来实现。\n\n这意味着存储简化，从而减少网络拥塞。\n\n![Vitalik在ETHCC的演讲：以太坊发展路线图和长期未来的思考](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com//panews/2022/7/23/images/f92c9f4c76ac1f657f7c484edd3e9e4b.png)\n\n**05. The Splurge 阶段**\n\n本阶段将进行一系列杂七杂八的\\*较小\\*升级，确保以太坊网络在上述 4 个阶段完成之后平稳运行。\n\n除了新路线图的 5 大阶段，V 神还对以太坊当前问题及未来发展进行了展望。Sachin Tomar 总结如下：\n\n1\\. 论证 L1 与 L2 的关系\n\n![Vitalik在ETHCC的演讲：以太坊发展路线图和长期未来的思考](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com//panews/2022/7/23/images/acc98e51e5bb5d54600235af55b94b36.png)\n\nVitalik 表示：我们正处于一个通过协议快速变化从而提升以太坊 (L1) 能力的阶段。但最终我们将停止对协议进行快速更改，并利用 L2 (第二层网络) 等系统为以太坊生态系统添加更多功能。\n\n以太坊 L1 层用于提供安全性和可靠性，L2 层用于快速迭代操作。\n\n“功能逃逸速度” (Functionality escape velocity) 理论：一旦 L1 足够强大，剩下的交给 L2 就可以了。开发人员需要休息，新功能需要时间来降低风险。\n\n2\\. Vitalik 的担忧\n\n![Vitalik在ETHCC的演讲：以太坊发展路线图和长期未来的思考](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com//panews/2022/7/23/images/68a4649d0da6383091572fe6a99059fc.png)\n\n添加对多个虚拟机的支持将会增加共识复杂性；\n\n解决基础层 SNARKS 而不是等待更好的路径设计。\n\n使以太坊变得如此复杂，以至于只有开发人员才能理解它的设计。\n\n**3. 长期的回报需要短期的痛苦**\n\n![Vitalik在ETHCC的演讲：以太坊发展路线图和长期未来的思考](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com//panews/2022/7/23/images/cefd1345afd5829cdfa9d526a5758f70.png)\n\n围绕 child calls、存储等改革 Gas 成本规则。\n\n对于 EIP-4444：客户端必须停止在 p2p 层上提供超过一年的历史 headers (区块头)、bodies (区块体) 和收据，客户端可以在本地删除这些历史数据。\n\nEVM (以太坊虚拟机) 的改进。\n\n切换到 Verkle 树 (用更少的空间存储更多的数据)。这可能意味着以太坊没有向后兼容性。\n\n**4. 专注于以太坊网络的去中心化**\n\n![Vitalik在ETHCC的演讲：以太坊发展路线图和长期未来的思考](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com//panews/2022/7/23/images/8725da03ae172b6f67327cbf5d26f8f5.png)\n\n当前的开发重点应该聚焦在易于使用的轻客户端，让任何人都可以运行它们。\n\n更好地支持人们在家就能参与以太坊质押，并支持较小规模的去中心化质押池 (staking pools)。\n\n在更轻便的硬件上运行完整节点。\n\n**5. 远期目标**\n\n![Vitalik在ETHCC的演讲：以太坊发展路线图和长期未来的思考](https://cdn-img.panewslab.com//panews/2022/7/23/images/1cf89dcccebd430bb6e8ffe0dd8a9fe2.png)\n\n使以太坊具有量子抗性，这样你就不需要运行量子计算机来生成某人的私钥。\n\n如果 zkEVM 运行良好，那么可在以太坊基础层中增加交易空间，以使 Rollups 成本降低。\n\n寻找更好的密码学。\n\n最后保持开放的心态！我们不知道 2032 年的需求到底是什么。\n", "timestamp": 1659060439, "digest": "RRJKKqrl7uKvU7RCxwA75iOuFLy5k8GeQ5TryPhB7JU", "contributor": "0xFb4c6dF1C62C62fd956546E749821b4a2B4D278b"}

Duty League Major 4 观看派对——事实上，这是元宇宙中的首个此类派对！但让它与众不同的不仅仅是活动的新颖性。该活动取得了巨大的成功，这在很大程度上归功于 Polygonal Mind 的工作，该开发工作室与 Subliner 的团队合作创建了举办观看派对活动的场地。\n\n查看此活动的网站：[链接](https://nyxl.com/dew/)\n\nPolygonal Mind 为此次活动开发的体验不仅仅是 Decentraland 中的一栋建筑，还包括多个关卡、一个可以赢得定制设计的可穿戴设备的寻宝游戏、一个

Web3 带来的潜力。像 Decentraland 这样的平台为社区发展、外展、参与和推广提供了新的、令人耳目一新的机会。但是，由于元宇宙对许多人来说仍然非常新颖且陌生，因此感兴趣的各方可能不知道该从哪里开始。这就是像 Polygonal Mind 这样的开发工作室能提供服务的地方。\n\n除了为品牌和社区创造新的机会之外，元宇宙还开辟了一个全新的职业路线，以提供使这些机会成为现实的熟练劳动力，并就什么在元宇宙中最适合提供内部人士的建议。原本为程序员和 Web3 爱好者的个人已经成为元宇宙建设者、体验开发者、可穿戴设计师、活动策划者、LAND 所有者等等。作为一家成功的工作室，Polygonal Mind 是元宇宙早期的资深人士，而现在已为好一些大品牌开发了许多绝佳体验。\n\n该工作室很乐意回答来自 Decentraland 基金会的一些问题，并与社区分享他们的故事，以及他们的行业观点和建议。一起来了解 Polygonal Mind 的元宇宙体验构建行业的幕后花絮。\n\n### Polygonal Mind 问答\n\n**DCL：当 MTN DEW x NYXL 这个项目找你时，他们是否已经知道他们想要设计和建造什么，或者你是否帮助他们构思了这种体验？如果是，你是如何想出为他们设计的体验的？**\n\n**PM：**这个项目是通过 Mountain Dew 的合作伙伴 NYXL 找到我们的，他们带着明确的愿景和目标来到我们这里，但在视觉方面完全开放。正如我们通常所做的那样，我们开始为他们创建完全不同的概念和草图，直到我们得到一个我们都认为拥有最好的用户体验但也非常适合 Mountain Dew 的品牌战略的概念。\n\nNYXL 一直是一个很好的合作伙伴，让我们能够为他们的空间提供独特而富有创意的一切。我们一起探讨了对 MtnDew 品牌和 NYSubliners 团队等中心主题的不同看法和观点。\n\n**DCL：他们什么时候联系你关于要在 Decentraland 中创建激活的事情？品牌应该提前多长时间寻找创作者？**\n\n**PM：**他们在 5 月中旬联系了我们。我们认为最好在活动安排前 3 个月联系设计/开发工作室。这将有足够的时间来准备整个战略，以确保我们能够完全符合合作伙伴的利益和期望。\n\n**DCL：最近有很多大品牌与你联系，以在虚拟世界中创建激活和体验吗？你觉得元宇宙中激活的潜力是否已经被主流完全实现了？要实现它需要什么？**\n\n**PM：**是的，多个月以来许多大品牌已经与我们进行联系，过去几个月我们的影响力有所增加。我们认为元宇宙中激活的潜力尚未完全实现，但我们确实看到了关注度和出席率的提高。我们致力于大规模采用。我们认为去中心化的元宇宙将继续存在，并且它们将在不久的将来成为常态。但底层技术有待改进；更好的加载时间、更多的集成、更动态的世界、互操作性、更多支持元宇宙的设备、更多的社交联系、增加虚拟身份感觉的改进等。除了技术之外，区块链、元宇宙和 NFT 的主要愿景需要正常化，这是我们认为只有时间才能解决的问题。\n\n**DCL：您认为使用此类活动和体验来推广品牌或社区的潜力和好处是什么？您认为它与传统的促销方式相比如何？**\n\n**PM：**元宇宙开辟了品牌及其社区之间参与的新方式。它比其他传统的广告方式更具沉浸感、吸引力和乐趣。如果我们将其与区块链相结合，我们将获得更多新的方式来与我们的观众互动而达到一个新的水平，他们不再被视为个人客户，而是作为一个整体社区，人们可以通过多种方式参与，例如投票或拥有品牌的数字产品可以为他们带来一些其它方式无法获得的好处和额外奖励。\n\n**DCL：你在 Decentraland 为品牌设计和创造什么样的体验？**\n\n**PM：**嗯，像这样的项目有很多阶段。根据客户及其对Web3/元宇宙的了解，项目在预生产阶段可能比实际生产阶段花费更多的时间。我们通常从一些咨询会议开始，在那里我们分享我们关于 Web3 和元宇宙激活的知识和专业知识，然后我们进入预生产阶段，我们为项目建立愿景和目标，确保我们与我们的合作伙伴完全一致，不仅在艺术上，而且从营销/商业的角度来看也是如此。最后我们进入生产阶段，我们不断分享我们的工作进展并在发布前讨论营销策略。\n\n**DCL：是什么让 Decentraland 的体验/激活“很棒”？成功的关键要素是什么？**\n\n**PM：**这种体验必须很有趣，并且与您在真实生活的活动中所习惯的不同。玩游戏、获得酷炫的可穿戴设备以及与其他玩家一起发现令人愉快的品牌时刻，这些都会让人们更快乐，并与品牌的价值观建立更紧密的联系。\n\n**DCL：对于希望在 Decentraland 推广和创造体验的品牌和社区，您有什么建议？**\n\n**PM：**不要专注于销售，而是要创造价值和社区。\n\n**DCL：Decentraland 在活动和激活方面为品牌和社区提供了哪些可能性？**\n\n**PM：**如今，Decentraland 是最开放和最发达的元宇宙平台之一，它可以让任何人创造几乎任何你能想象到的东西。由于它通过区块链本身去中心化，它允许我们实施几个新工具来增强用户体验。其中一些是直播、NFT、可穿戴设备和游戏开发等。\n\n**DCL：对于希望成为 Decentraland 体验设计师和创建者的其他人，你有什么建议？你需要什么样的技能？你的团队需要什么样的人？**\n\n**PM：**我们的第一条建议是在做任何事情之前先花时间在 Decentraland。从其他人正在做什么，他们如何以及为什么这样做以及人们在平台上的本地行为中学习。我们已经看到许多新设计师将大量时间投入到完全脱节的事物上，而社区可以很快看到这一点。至于技能组合，这更难回答。在这一点上，我们的工作室个人需要广泛的技能，因为我们的经验变得非常详细。我们需要 3D 艺术家、游戏开发人员、区块链开发人员、动画师、Web 开发人员等等……但如果你才刚开始，一个有程序员和艺术家的团队就足以在 Decentraland 中制作很酷的东西。\n\n**DCL：你认为这些类型的激活和促销是未来吗？你认为它们将如何随着时间的推移而变化和发展？**\n\n**PM：**是的！与常规广告相比，这些举措对用户而言更具互动性，它们还可以为你提供有关谁对你的品牌感兴趣以及感兴趣程度的直接信息！这样的事情很难预见，就在一年前，我们为 MTN DEW 制作的事件是完全无法概念化的。 Decentraland 几乎每天都在技术层面上发展，同时也在社区层面上发展。新来者带着新想法进入平台，使整个平台旋转以适应他们。实时看到变化是非常令人兴奋的。我们期望的是更丰富的体验，质量胜于数量。\n\n**DCL：Polygonal Mind 的故事是什么？你是怎么走到今天的？你最初是否打算在元宇宙中创造体验？你对你的未来有什么看法？**\n\n**PM：**Polygonal Mind 在八年前作为一个独立的游戏开发工作室开始。我们转型为一家外包工作室，为移动和 VR 行业的游戏开发者提供艺术。我们开发了许多低多边形游戏，如 Morphite，获得了 Apple Store 的艺术奖项，并参与了 Beat Saber 等大型 VR 游戏。\n\n然后，在 2018 年底，就在第二次 LAND 销售之前，我们发现了 Decentraland。我们开始涉足社区，当时社区里大多都是爱好者和程序员，所以我们认为这对我们来说是完美的匹配。作为一家独立的创意工作室，我们觉得我们有机会利用我们的艺术知识帮助建立 Decentraland 的未来。一段时间后，Momus 集体找到了我们，并聘请我们建造了 Momus 公园，这是 Decentraland 有史以来第一个加密艺术画廊，至今仍然是最大的。这在当时是一个巨大的技术挑战，我们需要多次来回才能实现它，因为我们必须与数百个 LAND 合作，这在当时几乎是不可能的。\n\n从那时起，我们一直在 Decentraland 中建造东西，并且我们慢慢地将注意力从游戏行业转移到了元宇宙。到 2020 年底，我们 80% 的收入仅来自 Decentraland 项目。从那时起，我们建立了艺术画廊、游戏、总部、活动区、可穿戴设备以及许多其它疯狂的体验，比如 MegaCube。这是额外的背景信息，至今我们构建了近 4000 个 LAND 的场景，并将我们的工作室从 4 人发展到 50 名团队成员，同时保持独立！\n\n对我们来说，未来充满希望，我们希望继续在 Decentraland 中尽可能多地创造，通过艺术作为让人们进入其中的入口。\n\n**选择您常用的频道加入与我们联系，关注Decentraland(MANA)的最新动态**\n\n**DCL基金会全球社区：\n【[Official

Capital、DTC Capital、CoinFund、Compound 首席执行官 Robert Leshner 等参投。\n\n## 02 Opyn Squeeth 交互教程\n\n**前期准备：**\n\n*   Chrome浏览器；\n*   梯子（需要科学上网。推荐：[https://kuaiyu.xyz/auth/register?code=dH2u）；](https://kuaiyu.xyz/auth/register?code=dH2u%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%9B)\n\n**撸空投注意事项：**\n\n*   目前 Opyn 官方尚未明确发币，也未明确是否会有空投；\n*   如果有空投，按以往经验，在平台完成交互即可；\n*   需要一定的交互成本（低Gwei时，刷 Opyn 全套流程成本在20-50U之间）；\n\n**1. 打开官网：<https://www.opyn.co/>**\n\n进入官网后，点击“SQUEETH”按钮，。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FtPkqZsTgAVyxKVCnVAY9M.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n进入 Squeeth 交易页面后，点击连接小狐狸钱包。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FOyVTxxv0c8Rd97uFUjWwU.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nSqueeth  目前有三类不同的产品，一是 Squeeth 永续期权 ，二是 Strategies 策略产品，三是 LP 。\n\n刷交互的原则是最好把项目上的每类产品与功能都交互下，当成真实用户去体验产品，防止被项目方定义为女巫用户地址。部分用户如果考虑成本问题，也可只刷核心的产品功能「Squeeth 」。\n\n**2. 做多或做空 Squeeth**\n\nSqueeth 可选择做多或做空。做多 Squeeth 是一个带杠杆头寸，具有无限的上涨空间，有限的下跌空间，且不会面临清算。和永续合约类似，Squeeth 也需要通过资金费率，使标记Squeeth 价格维持在指数价格 ETH^2 附近。但是因为Short 的风险远高于 Long （存在凸性溢价），一般情况下都是多头向空投支付至今费率。\n\nSqueeth 中的多头头寸用 oSQTH 表示，做多的用户可以直接以 ETH 从 Uniswap 上买入oSQTH，无清算风险；做空的用户则需要以 ETH 为抵押品铸造 oSQTH 再卖出，存在爆仓的风险。\n\n*   以做多为例（假设我未来看涨ETH）：\n\n点击 “Trade” ，选择“Long”“Open”，输入购买 ETH 的数量，可自动换算得到oSQTH的数量，再点击“BUY”即可进行购买。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FLSPwkRO2ssETjt7XLomYX.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n然后再进行交易确认。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fqdhki11ln\\_8mUtLlmDRSv.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n交易确认后，即可在面板中看到自己的持仓。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FqXU_ICGvDrBE_RxZc2C2C.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n然后，可以选择卖出所持仓的 oSQTH ，进行平仓。点击“Close”，输入卖出的数量，进行授权并确认交易即可卖出。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FNIpDpg3rgRBotf6n4m6cv.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**3.Strategies 策略产品**\n\nSqueeth Strategies 中包含三种策略，可以帮助用户一键生成对应的头寸，它们分别为看涨的牛市策略 Bull Strateg 、看跌的熊市策略 Bear Strategy 、以及横盘中的螃蟹策略 Crab Strategy ，目前已经上线的只有螃蟹策略 Crab Strategy 。\n\n螃蟹策略通过持有ETH和空头Squeeth头寸，以创建与ETH价格的Delta近似于0的策略。当ETH在小范围内波动时，ETH的涨跌将使ETH多头头寸和Squeeth空头头寸的盈亏接近于抵消，该策略依靠做空Squeeth获得资金费用带来收入。\n\n螃蟹策略设定了能够参与的最大资金，为888 ETH，目前存款已达到上限，暂不能参与。\n\n**4.添加LP**\n\nLP的参与方式有两种，一种是Mint Squeeth to LP，即通过 mint 获得 oSQTH 来添加流动性，这种参与方式的门槛较高（最低需要6.9ETH ），不建议参与。另外一种是Buy Squeeth to LP，即直接在 Uniswap 购买 选择Buy Squeeth to LP 来添加流动性。\n\n选择Buy Squeeth to LP。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FqVx9E5r4mg-s00GSWBBVF.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n可选择跳转到 Uniswap 进行添加流动性。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FVWaMCGvnaz3nnO1nZn6KM.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n输入添加流动性的 ETH 和 oSQTH 数量，授权后即可添加流动性。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FZ6IY85Vx4l2MJTSbgjD2b.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n确认添加。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FJ0JSlJbsKikX3Wdihc83-.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n展示已添加的流动性。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FDpHcMaQ_TuB9aR2SpNyOr.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n最后直接去除流动性。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FNgJmTynoYvJn-SOR3PSeQ.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n以上就是完成所有的交互了，有条件的可以隔一段时间，按同样的操作再交互几次。\n\n本文自发微信公众号：0xONE（关注区块链一级项目，空投、羊毛撸起来。）\n\n作者：DEMO\n\n推特：@hellopmdemo\n\n**⚠️ 风险提示**\n\n本文仅供学习交流，不作任何投资建议！\n", "timestamp": 1659060600, "digest": "arpYJUEU0o7TTkfTMwacEXBS0vKOFN1EKDvhNzUhklQ", "contributor": "0xE9fBC77427074635331ABCf9E57b47dbfdC3EdF2"}

市场匹配性，而另一方面则是背离市场惯性和共识标准的创新设计。如果一个团队为了创新而决定打破标准，却没有获得其他利益相关者的认同，那么他们就必须承担相应的后果。生态系统中的利益相关者越多，需要同意的人就越多，想要做出改变就越难。\n\n试想一下，如果团队想要打造一个闭环且不基于标准的专有系统，就可以从头开始构建一切，自由地实施、调整技术，而不用再得到其他人的认同。当然，这种做法的缺点是开发成本会更高，而且市场定位的获取也可能更具挑战性。然而，一旦该产品找到了其匹配市场，就可以在不受标准限制的情况下不断加速创新进程了。\n\n![](https://image.theblockbeats.info/upload/2022-07-27/1a8542c3b404083e8c03870119a861b13005ca69.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_50/watermark,image_d2F0ZXJtYXJrbmV3LnBuZz94LW9zcy1wcm9jZXNzPWltYWdlL3Jlc2l6ZSxQXzIw,g_center/format,jpg)\n\n## 标准与创新之矛盾\n\n标准与创新之间矛盾的存在将迫使团队做出选择：采用标准从而获得与庞大生态系统中其他现有产品一样的分销 / 互操作性优势（以牺牲长期创新为代价），还是从头开始构建一切以寻求更高的灵活性和创新潜力（以牺牲现有受众为代价）？\n\n播客平台与 RSS 标准\n\n在被 Spotify 收购之前，我们在建立 Anchor 的早期阶段就曾面临过这一问题。我们几乎不能对播客格式做出任何创新性的改变，因为它完全基于 RSS 标准。\n\n比如说，假设我们想为播客开启评论区，并让这些评论在节目的 RSS 源中得到显示。那么，除非我们能让数以百计的播客软件采纳这一变化，否则听众还是无法参与评论。这样一来，创作者不仅无法得到任何反馈，而且我们也没有任何安装这一功能的机会。\n\n或者说，假设我们想建立一个更丰富、更灵活的播客分析系统，方便创作者更好地了解他们节目的成效，从而通过接广告的方式增加他们的收入。那么同样，除非我们也让其他应用采纳这一系统，否则我们无法将数据传送回平台当中，最后只能放弃这一功能。\n\n在过去的 20 年里，RSS 的存在让任何一个播客软件都只能按照完全固化的标准进行刻制，但凡哪个团队想要打造差异化的产品，都会以失败告终。\n\n## 通信软件与 SMS 标准\n\n在通信软件当中，这种局限性同样存在。SMS 这一短消息标准发明于 20 世纪 80 年代，经过近十年的发展，在得到所有重要人士的支持后，它终于在 1992 年成为第一部移动电话和手机运营商采纳的标准，并最终在 1999 年得到普及。在这之后，世界上任何地方的任何人都可以向其他采用 SMS 标准的手机发送短信，而不用考虑他们使用的是哪个供应商或设备。\n\n之后，有人想出了一个绝妙的主意，给通信软件增加图片功能。如果你可以给别人发送图片，那该是多好的一件事。然而，由于 SMS 是一个开放的标准，因此图片不能仅仅被编入最新的软件更新中，标准本身也需要作出调整，而且每个设备制造商和运营商都必须同意这种变化。最终，SMS 演变为了 MMS，然后又过了十年左右的时间，MMS 才最终达到规模。\n\niMessage 是苹果公司专有的通信软件，但其并没有采用原有的标准。iMessage 之所以能广为使用，都是 iPhone 的功劳——要使用 iMessage，你必须拥有一台苹果设备，如 iPhone，不过这也肯定是个缺点。但如果你选择了苹果设备，你就可以享受到苹果的优质服务。得益于自己的专有生态系统，苹果可以不断的提升用户体验，让任何采用 SMS 标准的通信软件都望尘莫及。\n\n![](https://image.theblockbeats.info/upload/2022-07-27/9af59a8669455ef5211fff47b0e405381bbcbff3.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_50/watermark,image_d2F0ZXJtYXJrbmV3LnBuZz94LW9zcy1wcm9jZXNzPWltYWdlL3Jlc2l6ZSxQXzIw,g_center/format,jpg)\n\n## 通信软件发展历程\n\n在这几年的时间当中，iMessage 发生了相当大的变化：早年间，它与 SMS 没有什么区别；但现在，它的功能已经非常丰富了——已读标记、照片库、滤镜、自定义表情、应用商店、语音备忘录，等等等等。而 Snapchat、Messenger、WhatsApp 和其他许多此类的通信软件也是如此，它们都摒弃了 SMS 标准，从而获得了创新和快速发展的机会。不过代价是，它们也无法和其他的软件进行互动，失去了一批潜在用户。\n\n## 订阅平台与 SMTP 标准\n\n最近，你可能听说过一款火爆的电子邮件订阅平台——Substack，在上面创作者能够自主构建、存储及扩展他们自己的咨讯业务。\n\nSubstack 的聪明之处在于，它使用了一个开放的标准，即 SMTP，来轻松地向任何拥有电子邮箱的人发送新闻咨讯。\n\n与上面的播客例子相比，任何采用 RSS 的平台都可以立即解决供应方面的问题，而 Substack 则反其道而行之：它把重点放在了需求方面，确保每名用户都能阅读到咨讯内容。这是一个非常聪明的策略，不仅加速了它的发展，也同时吸引了大批知名作家和付费用户。\n\n不过，尽管这种利用 SMTP 向读者即时发送内容的方法效果惊人，但其代价在于：只要电子邮件遵从的是 SMTP 标准，它就只能处于静态。这也就意味着 Substack 不能利用电子邮件来部署任何动态功能，比如在电子邮件客户端中实时优化读者的搜索体验、开放实时更新的评论区，或者实现任何其他类型可以提高用户体验的动态功能。同样的，如果 Substack 想要真正实施这些创新，就需要得到网上大多数主要电子邮件客户端开发团队的同意。\n\n因此，Substack 最近进行了一次巧妙的创新：它推出了一款应用程序，用于优化用户在 Substack 的使用体验。这样做的意义在于，如果 Substack 能将这款应用推广成功的话，就可以不断改进其平台用户体验，而不受制于 SMTP 的标准。不过这样做的同时也等于放弃了开放标准的优势，最初他们还是用这个标准发展起来的。\n\n在我看来，Substack 面临的矛盾点在于：是继续使用 SMTP，从而获得更广泛的受众；还是搭建一个专有的解决方案来加快创新的步伐。如今其应用的推出已经说明了 Substack 对于这一矛盾的态度，很显然它已经选择逐步远离标准。\n\n## 破除魔咒，二者兼得\n\n虽然标准与创新之间的矛盾可能会禁锢住多数想要有所改变的公司，但实际上，想要解决这一矛盾也不是毫无办法。事实上，目前已经有方法可以让团队既收获标准带来的好处，又能创新性地突破它的限制。\n\n### 充分利用现有系统\n\n只要时间够久，所有采用标准的产品最终都会大同小异。这是因为，标准根深蒂固、很难改变，产品的发展很快就会到达上限。同时，采用标准的产品越多，市场惯性就越大，标准也就越不可能发生改变了。对于各个产品来说，市场竞争会非常激烈，而且它们将很难通过差异化策略成功突围。所以说，为了有所突破，这些产品就必须在不受标准限制的市场寻找生机。\n\nSpotify 的播客业务就是一个例子。几年前，这个流媒体音频巨头还只是一个音乐平台，如今它已经囊括了许多其他类别的音频内容。鉴于音乐和播客在内容和体验上的差异，许多人都希望该公司能推出一款专门收听播客的应用程序，从而将这两种类型的音频内容加以区分。然而，如果 Spotify 这样做的话，就不得不加入到播客平台的市场竞争之中，而这一市场受到 RSS 标准的限制，所有产品提供的功能都大致相同。所以说，一旦 Spotify 转战这一市场，将像其他播客平台一样难以逾越标准的鸿沟。于是，Spotify 充分利用其现有的音乐用户群，在现有的 Spotify 应用程序中向数以亿计的用户发送播客。这样一来，Spotify 便成功的打破了这一魔咒。\n\n### 提供后向兼容性\n\n事实上，用户其实更喜欢使用基于标准的产品，因为这类产品不仅选择多样，而且数据转移也很灵活。所以说，对于想要走创新路线的产品来说，它们必须保留原有标准为用户提供的优势，否则就需要承担失去用户与市场的风险。要想做到这一点，产品可以搭载对标准的后向兼容性。我们可以看看苹果 iMessage 的做法，只要你曾经使用过 iMessage，你就很可能给安卓用户发过信息。当你发送信息时，信息框会变回原来的绿色，这是因为 iMessage 在此时采用回了 SMS 标准，方便你与收件人用短信互动。这样一来，苹果用户既可以体验到 iMessage 上的所有创新功能，又可以继续给安卓设备上的朋友发送信息。\n\n## 总结\n\n虽然标准会在一定程度上制约创新的脚步，但我们都不可否认标准化为技术发展带来了很多好处。所以，在依据标准建立新的产品时，开发团队要进行多方面的权衡，谨慎思考未来产品在走向市场时应如何处理好标准与创新的关系。", "timestamp": 1659060977, "digest": "5_NQBJTvkIfNKawBUZ8j_7FaNVwDJiveJQxdbHcENSs", "contributor": "0xebeC7682CFBc079ebfd3C4b40c730AFa8A2E5B3D"}

如果你真的想轻松一下，可以从总结伟大的、长的或复杂的作品开始。你会对人们花在阅读上的时间之少感到惊讶。而精选和速读形式的内容很重要，也很有价值；\n* 深入研究特定领域的专家类文章输出，包括但不限于流动性挖矿、NFTs、智能合约、稳定币、数字艺术品、DeFi 聚合器以及公链生态盘点等等；\n* 使用说明。你进行了一些操作和交互之后，用文字或图片告诉别人如何做。你可以教其他人如何在某些 DeFi 应用中进行交互，也可以让更多人了解某些 NFT 应用或者新的公链上应用交互等等；\n* 快速且及时的信息。\n\n## 推特\n\n如果你不喜欢长文章，Twitter 就是为你准备的。CryptoTwitter 重视那些参与讨论或提出相关问题的人。一些加密货币领域最聪明的人使用 Twitter 来建立他们的品牌，如 Pomp、Ryan Sean Adams、Meltem Dimirros、Arianna Simpson Nic Carter、Ari David Paul、Hasu、Tom Shaughnessy、Jason Choi 和 Ryan Watkins 等等。只是注意别在 Twitter 上把自己变成个骗子。\n\n关于推特的一些提示：\n\n* 为你喜欢的话题创建一个定期的 Twitter Space；\n* 聚集特定话题的精彩观点或总结；\n* 综合重要事件或高收听率的播客；\n* 利用图片——创作图片需要时间，但可以帮助提高传播性；\n* 在主题中标记相关的个人或公司是有助于传播的，但当他们在主题或图片中明显不相关时，不要标记他们，记住不要标记该死的 Elon 或 SBF，那完全没用。相反，要给 10K-100K 粉丝范围内的主体打标签。他们更有可能转发或喜欢你的帖子；\n* 搞笑贴和备忘录。CMS 实习生通过搞笑的创意视频和备忘录创造了一个品牌；\n* 持续输出——你需要每周至少发一次推特发表观点，或者至少分享一些有趣的内容；\n* 要有创意，或者至少在现有的想法上找到自己与众不同的解读；\n* 你将从零粉丝开始，0 到 1000 是最难的，从 1000 增长到 10000 也需要相当长的时间，不过在此以后的增长就会容易很多；\n* 推特的最后一条规则——要真实，人们想关注的是人，而不是机器人。\n\n## 充分利用其他社交媒体平台\n\n虽然 Twitter 拥有最强大的加密货币社区，但你还可以使用 Instagram、Reddit、Periscope、TikTok 或其他社交媒体网络扩大影响力。我还强烈建议拥抱新的社交媒体平台或功能，如 TikTok 或 Twitter Spaces。如果你在收听一个频道时突然意识到「哇，这内容太垃圾了，我可以做得更好」，那么你可能是对的，一定会有人愿意为更高质量的内容买单。我们要去不断尝试新的东西，然后坚持其中最有效的方式。\n\n## 开设一个 YouTube 频道或播客\n\n也许你不是一个文字工作者，但你擅长制作视频，尤其是直播内容。那就请果断开设你自己的 Youtube 频道或制作一些教程视频。YouTube 是当今第二大搜索引擎——利用它。\n\n播客是加密货币讨论的基础。Jill Carlson 和 Meltem Demirors 有一个很棒的播客。Tony Sheng 也办了一个有趣的播客。Peter McCormack 的《比特币做了什么》。Nathaniel Whittemore 创办了[Long Reads Sunday](https://t.co/RDuINI6IXi?amp=1)。这些都已经积累了相当的影响力。\n\n来自一个从未主持过播客的人的不请自来的相关建议：\n\n* 看在上帝的份上，不要以为播客就是对 X 人的采访；\n* 考虑直播播客，以提高真实性和及时性；\n* 让你的播客成为一个故事（疯狂的天才）或与众不同的东西；\n* 请先听一听 Robinhood Snack 的[播客](https://snacks.robinhood.com/)，它做的是每天的小新闻，或者 Naval 和 Nivi 的播客，来自[Spearhead](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/spearhead-naval-xWVg_YRt-0w/)或[How to Get Rich](https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich)；\n* 小到 3 到 15 分钟的播客都是有受众的。不要因为乔·罗根做成功了长达 3 小时播客就认为每个播客都需要至少 1 小时。\n\n## 线下聚会、活动和俱乐部\n\n如果你身处一个充斥着区块链活动的地方，我建议你多去参加聚会或社区活动，其中大部分是免费的。一些常见的寻找活动的地方包括[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/)或[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/ethereum/)（译者注：Foresight News[日历](https://foresightnews.pro/calendar)也是个不错的选择）。对于大学生来说，可以去看看你学校的区块链俱乐部，或者创办你自己的区块链俱乐部。如果你在找工作，我不建议你去付费参加会议，因为会议门票不会带来很好的投资回报率，除非你在人际关系方面的天赋令人难以置信（让我们面对现实吧，如果你真是这样，你应该早就已经被雇用了）。早期的 NFT 社区都会经常举办聚会，像 Bankless 和 Friends With Benefits 这样的社会 DAO 也经常会举办活动。\n\n## 搬到一个充满加密气息的城市\n\n从本质上讲，我们都是环境的产物。如果你想在技术领域取得成功，你可能应该住在创新发生的地方，这不是什么秘密。我不是说你一定要搬到纽约或旧金山这样的城市，但如果你住在那里，你应该利用它。美国其他新兴的科技城市包括洛杉矶、丹佛、奥斯汀和西雅图。如果你愿意去国外冒险，你有更多选择。柏林、上海或新加坡都是可以让自己获得优势的好地方。\n\n我要提醒的是，你住在哪里越来越不重要了。大多数加密货币公司都是以远程为先，但如果你还年轻，我仍然建议你亲自去见人，以巩固这些联系。在办公室或在周二下午的酒会上与你的同事建立联系，要比在网络上建立联系容易得多。\n\n## 充分利用你的优势\n\n有一定工作经验的人应该利用这一点。如果你有以下任何一项技能：\n\n* 数据分析\n* CPA\n* CFA\n* 律师\n* 无畏的公共演讲者\n* 能像狄更斯一样写作\n* 人际关系「魔法师」\n* 设计\n* 经济学知识\n\n如果你拥有这些技能中的任何一项，那么你就拥有比目前从事加密货币的许多人更大的优势。对于那些学生和年轻人来说，你也可以利用你的时间来学习上述技能。\n\n## 乐于助人\n\n这并不意味着天天告诉别人「请让我知道我能提供什么帮助」。与任何其他行业相比，加密货币世界很小。你可以在 Twitter 上与人联系，也可以通过电子邮件联系。不要向风险投资公司的经理或你喜欢的加密货币公司的首席执行官联系，他们很可能不会回应。找一个新加入公司的人，因为他们可能有更多的时间，并且会把你作为一个年轻的专业人士来看待。\n\n有一堆关于如何与人接触的文章，所以我就不多说了，只是你应该找到一种提供价值的方式，包括但不限于：\n\n* 人们总是在寻找东西，帮助他们找到他们需要的信息；\n* 对内容、新闻、信息、数据、人物、教育材料等进行整理；\n* 在你的社区建立一个本地网络；\n* 换位思考——人们并不总是能够告诉你他们想要 / 需要什么。你独特的技能和特质可以提供什么？\n\n## 寻找一个加密领域的伙伴\n\nETH 有朋友，你也应该有。找一个和你一样有激情的朋友，在上述任何一个话题上相互合作。没有人能够独自登上顶峰，即使你登上了顶峰，那里也是孤独的。瑞安·肖恩·亚当斯和大卫·霍夫曼是一台油墨充足的内容机器。Hasu——可以说是加密货币领域最好的研究人员之一——也经常与其他个人一起写作。\n\n## 如何找工作\n\n有两种方法可以找到工作。简单的方法和困难的方法。\n\n### 简单的方法\n\n作为一个人，去建立一个该死的人脉网络。说实话，人脉是找工作的最好方法。付出努力去接触，去参加活动，或在网上交流，对你的帮助比你知道的要大。人们都会希望与他们的朋友一起工作。\n\n### 困难的方法\n\n我可以提供的最好的建议是：你需要脱颖而出，瞄准你的受众。你申请的质量比你发送的申请的数量更重要。\n\n向 100 份工作发送同样的求职信或申请书可能会让你得到一份工作，但如果只有少数几家你真正想工作的公司，你需要付出努力才能得到这份工作。\n\n我对精心设计你的申请的最后一条建议——一定要与众不同。比如说：\n\n* 创作一个图表或视频，直观地表达一些东西；\n* 设计一个很酷的项目，或者找一个现有的项目做一些稍微不同的改动和调整；\n* 先一步把握住一个不断增长的趋势，如社交代币；\n* 做一个网站或 Newsletter，提供一些有价值的东西，例如关于新的 NFT 发行信息，或每个开源加密项目的会议时间列表。找到一种方法来节省别人的时间或精力，这就是加分项；\n* 研究一个与区块链相关的超级利基话题，并撰写 / 推送你的发现。它不应该是肤浅的，但也不一定是完全革命性的，只是在推特上 / 写 / 说你的观点；\n* 写一些头部加密货币产品和协议的观点分享；\n* 雇主重视那些自驱力强并能创作很酷的东西的人。\n\n如果你还是个学生，或者刚刚离开校园一两年的时间，请意识到自己很幸运。你很可能有大量的时间——或者你可以更有效地利用这些时间——来建立你的个人品牌并遵循上述建议。\n\n## 关于你简历的说明\n\n再强调一遍，要让你的简历具象化。如果你完全不知道如何制作你的简历或想从头开始，哈佛大学提供了很多免费的材料。另外，在你的简历上要有创意——做一个概念页——或者至少添加一些有美感的模板。记住，你面对的是人类，他们自然会被明亮的颜色、图形和图片所吸引。\n\n重要的是，在可能的情况下使用数据和指标，即使它只是显示你在社交媒体上的逐月增长、最佳博客文章或者 Newsletter 订阅人数等。\n\n此外，没有人会阅读你的整个简历。他们想要的是你的亮点、相关经验，以及你的重要渠道（即 Github、Twitter、TikTok 等）的链接。\n\n这些是一些找工作的好渠道：\n\n* AngelList 是在加密货币创业公司找工作的最好地方之一；\n* Crypto Jobs；\n* CryptoJobsList；\n* Cryptocurrency jobs；\n* Pomp Crypto Jobs；\n* Proof of Talent，适用于更高级 / 技术性的职位；\n* LinkedIn，在 LinkedIn 上寻找加密货币和区块链工作正变得越来越普遍；\n* Web3 Jobs；\n* Newsletters，关注你喜欢的公司的 Newsletter，他们经常会发布新的职位或机会；\n* 大多数风险投资公司为他们的投资组合公司发布职位空缺。\n\n## 胆子大一些\n\n你也许觉得自己没有资格，请果断申请。\n\n你也许害怕发推特或公开发表观点。无论如何都要做。\n\n你会犯错。这没关系，你的观点也可以调整。\n\n## 最后的想法\n\n努力工作，保持谦逊，快乐地生活。", "timestamp": 1659060849, "digest": "4G753-DNJsBcpjNfHh9OiyIptaQ4sPKQ_rKsFNOob6M", "contributor": "0x4C48F992B9201b4f7C26a7bE42D80D034402e14C"}
{"id": "xI3GWSFaze6c-mlsm5uEY_LccavfM45BRQXrdFT_e2w", "title": "Vitalik：PoS 为何是更好的选择？", "body": "与 PoW 相比，PoS 是一个更好的区块链安全机制，原因有三个。\n\n### 基于 GPU 的工作证明\n\n你可以便宜地租用 GPU，所以攻击网络的成本只是租用足够的 GPU 来超过现有的矿工成本。\n\n对于每 1 美元的区块奖励，现有的矿工应该花费近 1 美元的成本（如果他们花费更多，矿工就会因为无利可图而退出，如果他们花费更少，新的矿工可以加入并获得高额利润）。\n\n因此，攻击网络只需要每天花费 1 美元以上，而且只需要几个小时。\n\n攻击总成本：约为 0.26 美元（假设攻击时间为 6 小时），当攻击者收到区块奖励时，可能会降到零。\n\n### 基于 ASIC 的工作证明\n\nASIC 是一种资本成本：购买一次的 ASIC，在它磨损或被更新硬件之前，我们可以预计使用 2 年。\n\n如果一个链受到 51% 攻击，社区很可能会改变 PoW 算法，那么 ASIC 将失去其价值。平均而言，挖矿的持续成本约为 1/3，资本成本约为 2/3。\n\n因此，每天 1 美元的奖励，矿工每天将花费 0.33 美元用于电费 + 维护，0.67 美元用于 ASIC。假设一个 ASIC 可以使用 2 年，那么一个矿工需要在这个数量的 ASIC 硬件上花费 486.67 美元。\n\n攻击总成本：486.67 美元（ASIC）+ 0.08 美元（电费 + 维护）= 486.75 美元\n\n也就是说，ASIC 以中心化的高成本提供了这种更高级别的安全防护，其原因是因为加入的门槛变得非常高。\n\n### 权益证明\n\n权益证明几乎完全是资本成本（投入的币）；唯一的运行成本是运行一个节点的成本。那么人们愿意锁定多少资本来获得每天 1 美元的回报呢？\n\n与 ASIC 不同，存入的代币不会贬值，当你完成质押后，你可以在短时间内取回自己的币。因此，参与者应该愿意为相同数量的奖励支付更高的资本成本。\n\n让我们假设大约 15% 的回报率足以激励人们质押（这是 eth2 的预期回报率）。那么，每天 1 美元的回报将吸引 6.667 年的存款回报，即 2433 美元。\n\n节点硬件和电力成本小；一台价值 1000 美元的电脑可以质押数十万美元的金额，而每月需要 100 美元左右的电费和网络费用就足够了。\n\n但保守地说，这些持续成本约占总投资成本的 10%，所以我们每天只有 0.90 美元的回报对应于资本成本，因此我们确实需要将上述数字削减 10%。\n\n攻击总成本：0.90 美元 / 天 \\* 6.667 年 = 2189 美元\n\n从长远来看，随着质押变得更有效，人们也会适应较低的回报率，这一成本预计还会更高。我个人认为这个数字最终会上升到 1 万美元左右。\n\n获得这种高安全性的唯一「成本」只是在质押时不能随意移动币。\n\n甚至可能出现这样的情况：公众知道所有这些币都被锁定了，这导致币的价值上升，所以社区中流动的，准备进行有生产性的投资的总代币数量保持不变。\n\n然而在 PoW 中，维持共识的「成本」是大量消耗的真实电力。\n\n### 更高的安全性还是更低的成本？\n\n有两种方法可以使用这种 5-20 倍的安全收益。一种是保持区块奖励不变，但从增强的安全性中获益。\n\n另一种是大幅减少区块奖励（从而减少共识机制的「浪费」），并保持安全级别不变。\n\n两种方式都可以。我个人更喜欢后者，因为正如我们将在下面看到的，在 Pos 中，即使是成功的被攻击也比对工作证明的攻击危害小得多，而且更容易从攻击中恢复过来！\n\n## 在 PoS 中，攻击更容易恢复\n\n在工作证明系统中，如果你的链有被 51% 攻击，你会怎么做？到目前为止，在实践中唯一的反应是「等待，直到攻击者感到厌烦」。\n\n但这却忽视了一种更危险的攻击类型，即 spawn camping 攻击，即攻击者反复攻击链，其目标就是使其变得无用。\n\n在基于 GPU 的系统中，没有防御措施，持久的攻击者可以很容易地使链永久无用。\n\n事实上，在最初几天后，攻击者的成本可能会变得非常低，因为诚实的矿工会因为在攻击过程中无法获得奖励而退出。\n\n在基于 ASIC 的系统中，社区可以对第一次攻击作出响应，但从那以后的再次攻击变得微不足道。\n\n社区将会遇到第一次攻击，通过硬分叉来改变 PoW 算法，从而「破坏」所有的 ASIC（攻击者和诚实矿工的！）\n\n但是如果攻击者愿意承担最初的代价，在那之后，情况又回到 GPU 的情况（因为没有足够的时间为新算法构建和分发 ASIC），因此攻击者可以从那里以很低的成本继续刷出阵营。\n\n然而，在 PoS 的情况下，情况就好得多。\n\n对于某些类型的 51% 攻击（特别是，恢复最后确定的区块），在权益共识证明中有一个内置的「削减」机制，通过这种机制，攻击者的大部分质押可以自动销毁。\n\n对于其他更难检测的攻击，社区可以协调一个少数用户激活的软分叉（UASF），攻击者的资金再次被大量销毁（在以太坊中，这是通过「不活动泄漏机制」完成的）。\n\n不需要明确的「硬分叉删除币」；除了在 UASF 上协调选择少数区块的要求外，其他一切都是自动化的，只需遵循协议规则执行。\n\n因此，第一次攻击链将花费攻击者数百万美元，而社区将在几天内恢复正常。\n\n第二次攻击链仍然会让攻击者损失数百万美元，因为他们需要购买新币来替换被烧毁的旧币。第三次… 还要花费数百万美元。\n\n游戏是非对称的，对攻击者不利。\n\n## 权益证明比 ASIC 更去中心化\n\n基于 GPU 的工作证明是合理的并去中心化的；获得 GPU 并不难。但是基于 GPU 的挖矿在我们前面提到的「安全防御攻击」标准上却很大程度上是失败的。\n\n另一方面，基于 ASIC 的挖矿需要数百万美元的资金。\n\n这也是常见的「权益证明意味着富人更富」论点的正确答案：ASIC 挖矿也意味着富人更富，而这个游戏甚至更倾向于富人。\n\n至少在 PoS 中，需要的最低质押是相当低的。\n\n此外，权益证明更能抗审查。\n\nGPU 挖矿和 ASIC 挖矿都很容易被检测：它们需要大量的电力消耗，昂贵的硬件和大型仓库。\n\n另一方面，PoS 可以在一台不起眼的笔记本电脑上完成。\n\n## 工作证明可能具有的优点\n\n我认为 PoW 有两个主要的真正优势，尽管我认为这些优势相当有限。\n\n权益证明更像是一个「封闭系统」，在长期内导致更高的财富集中度。\n\n在权益证明中，如果你有一些币，也可以拿这个币进行质押，并获得更多的该币。在工作证明中，你总是可以赚取更多币，但你需要一些外部资源才能做到这一点。\n\n因此，有人可能会说，从长期来看，权益证明代币的分配风险变得越来越集中。\n\n我看到的主要回应是，在 PoS 中，奖励（以及验证者收益）将非常低；在 eth2 中，我们期望每年的验证者奖励相当于总 ETH 供应量的 0.5-2%。\n\n验证者质押越多，利率就越低。因此，集中程度可能需要一个多世纪才能翻倍，在这样的时间尺度上，其他压力可能占主导地位。\n\n### 权益证明需要「弱主观性」，而工作证明不需要\n\n从本质上说，一个节点第一次上线，以及一个节点在离线很长时间后再次上线，该节点必须找到一些第三方来源，以确定正确的链头。\n\n这可能是他们的朋友，它可能是交易所和区块浏览器站点，客户端开发人员自己，或许多其他参与者。PoW 没有这个要求。\n\n然而，可以说这是一个非常弱的要求：事实上，用户已经需要信任客户端开发人员和 / 或「社区」了。\n\n至少，用户需要信任某人（通常是客户端开发人员）来告诉他们协议是什么，以及协议的更新是什么。\n\n这在任何软件应用程序中都是不可避免的。因此，PoS 所施加的边际附加信任要求仍然很低。", "timestamp": 1659060759, "digest": "s6ps3cO_jRJl7sRlOSbEYbHrpHVkS4cw3qX7PZgofSg", "contributor": "0x034196E751c15Db00C66144e0A6b075E2Dd20895"}
