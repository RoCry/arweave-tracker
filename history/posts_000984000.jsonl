{"id": "N4WISA9E8rd69o34HG_TfK7TFqaHWIQBGbfd7JdPGSo", "title": "$ENIOLA 04: Building in a Bear Market", "body": "*Hey peeps, this is the first update post Launch House + NFT.NYC. Last month there was a focus on launching, launching and launching. For the most part, a unique blend of resources, connections and timelines were in-line to act as a launchpad for various projects (entrepreneurial and personal). It’s been well documented that current market conditions have put a spanner in the works for many start-ups, scale-ups and other builders. Some of my friends have lost the majority of their net worth, whilst others have now entered the job market. In these unprecedented times, the sentiment of many people on crypto Twitter is just to hunker down and build. But reality for the majority doesn’t allow for such basic and unthoughtful advice. All I can say is do what you can to get through the bear market. Get that job AND build, support your family AND build, take care of your body and mind AND build. To be comfortable building a startup in any market condition is some form of privilege in itself; something that builders and investors forget sometimes. Build if it makes sense. Do not be roped in by the simple platitudes you see online.*\n\nI think that’s my most extended introduction to any of my updates thus far → lets' dive in!\n\n### Month In Retrospect\n\n* I wrapped up a month in New York as part of Launch House, Founders House Summer 2022 Cohort (yes, it’s a long title). I had an amazing time there, built connections, had fun and learnt a lot. You can read [articles](https://eniola.mirror.xyz) and view [tweets](https://twitter.com/elijah_ajuwon/status/1528877678115586048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1528877678115586048%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Feniola.mirror.xyz%2FA2MwquHQCIlQtTEsTyHJpvtMcDORoeHaisy0a-ZEetw) about my experiences.\n* I attended NFT.NYC for the first time as well, it was a good conference with amazing speakers from the biggest VCs and founders of some of the biggest web3 startups. However, I found that there was more value in the satellite events and after-parties, for me personally. I think I may end up applying to speak at the conference next year.\n* A demo for early.fans can be viewed on our [notion wiki](https://earlyfans.notion.site/early-fans-wiki-7e45427b91d74f29b2889e11b4120386). There you can get to grips with the looks and feel of the first iteration of our MVP.\n* We started having meetings with VCs, from both the United Kingdom and States. As mentioned before this is a numbers game. Each VC has different theses and methods. I have received varying advice from the firms; some of which conflicting but it’s important to build with users, make sure there’s a market and get some early traction. Someone will eventually take the first leap.\n* There were no proposals for $ENIOLA holders to vote on this month. Monthly proposals will make a come-back.\n\n### Biggest Takeaways\n\n* Right now I am unwavering. Even with these market conditions and personal circumstances, my first thought is what can I do to continue building. Do I get a job? Do I split the raise? Who do I partner with or reach out to? Should I relocate? My game plan may have changed but the goal hasn’t.\n* I want to feel small again. When I was in New York, I was constantly being reminded of how unremarkable and small I was. Now I know the language is dramatic and don’t worry I am not going through a quarter-life or identity crisis, it is just impossible for me to be comfortable with my achievements or goals. Some of my peers are doing amazing things. I know that comparison is the death of joy, but I what I took from this was the difference in my personal mentality and drive when around a certain type of individual. \n\n### What’s Next\n\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n\n*To view the redacted content please buy some $ENIOLA you can reach out to me or buy it on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet).*\n\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nTo the builders (in whatever capacity) reading this,c sondier your environment. When this type of discourse happens people typically focus on their friends and WHO they are surrounded by. However, what is equally important is WHAT are you surrounded by. What resources do you have access to? What infrastructure has been set up in your location? What ecosystems are you plugged into? The whats are as equally important as the whys.", "timestamp": 1659034956, "digest": "d3RTD4bbrAJZ1QZzCFnuZpQYhvcWujabklEYi4o6t-0", "contributor": "0xE314f925f05c8f5e4063Dd19684992196f5d89D9"}
{"id": "GQcOI9zqyI7sps8NdG6wS5LP_oqGjAXODpgqy2ZIOLw", "title": "Deploy your first smart contract to distribute your video on blockchain", "body": "Share is a protocol and dApp built on blockchain that enables creators to choose the price per stream of their audio or video content, distribute the content directly to consumers, make it accessible on any web application, and receive payments instantly when their content is streamed. Share has a wide variety of applications including music, video, and podcasts.\n\n*This article overviews the process to **deploy a VIDEO on blockchain with SHARE** and provides example information that you can use to test out the process.*\n\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIn the *[Share User Guide](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-user-guide)* you can find the general requirements to use Share. This includes [selecting and setting up a Web3 wallet](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-pre-release-user-guide/select-and-setup-a-wallet) and [connecting to the Share dApp](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-user-guide/connect-to-the-dapp). If you haven’t already and are not familiar with some of the Web3 terminology and technology, please make sure you visit these sections and learn about what you’ll need to interact with Share.\n\n## Upload your video file and create a smart contract\n\n 1. **Video file.** Prepare a video file in MP4 format. MP4 is the most popular format for digital video. If you don't already have a video that you want to use for testing, you can use this [demo MP4 video](https://formless-eng.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/share-testvideo.mp4).\n 2. **Website location.** Navigate to <https://share.formless.xyz/create> in your web browser. Here you’ll see a series of steps where you will input information that is used to create the details of your smart contract.\n 3. **Creator Name.** Enter \"My Test Name\". This is the name you use to identify yourself, e.g. your artist name or your real name. This can be anything you choose, for example, you can do things like \"KANYE X JAY-Z\" if you'd like to list multiple names. Your content ownership is uniquely identified through your blockchain address, not the name entered here.\n 4. **Title.** Enter \"My Test Video Title\". Similar to the name field, this can be anything you want. The content will be uniquely identified using its smart contract address. This title is purely for display purposes.\n 5. **Upload.** Select \"Choose File\" and locate the test video MP4 file that we prepared above.\n 6. **Artwork and previews.** Select “Custom Artwork” and upload an image file that meets the file type and size requirements identified on screen. This image will appear as a thumbnail and as a screen cap on your video. Select “Custom Video Preview” and upload a video file that represent a segment of your full video content and meets the file type and size requirements identified on screen. Users will be able to play this content prior to purchasing access to your content. If your content is free, there’s no need to add the Custom Video preview since all of your content will play for free. \n 7. **Royalty Splits.** You’ll see your wallet address auto-populated in the Primary Owner field. When you start uploading content that has multiple creators, you can select the “Split Royalties” box, add addresses of other owners, identify their proportional share of royalties, and they’ll also be added as content owners in your smart contract. For now, keep this unchecked and proceed with yourself as the single owner of the content. This means revenues will flow to your address when the content is viewed.\n 8. **Price For Access.** Enter “0.25”. This means that viewers will need to pay 25 cents to watch your new video. The payment won't require them to enter any financial information, it will automatically flow from their wallet on the blockchain seamlessly. In this example, we're using 25 cents, but the beauty of Share is that you can set this value to be anything that you want. It can be 0 for free content, or any amount you wish, even $1M if that's what you think it's worth. You know your audience and the worth of your content better than we ever could.\n 9. **Apple and Google Pay.** Select “Enable Apple and Google Pay”. This will allow consumers to purchase access to your content using Apple Pay and Google Pay, and they won’t need to connect a Web3 wallet in order to purchase access to your content. This is an optional feature and is only available for content that is priced equal to or above 17 cents. There are a few additional fees ($.30 + 7.9% of the transaction value) that consumers will have to pay for the convenience of using Apple or Google Pay, but depending on your use case and how you’re pricing your content it may make sense.\n10. **Access Grant Time.** Enter 1 DAY, 0 HOURS, 0 MINUTES. This is the amount of time that the viewer will have access to your content after they complete the instant micro-payment. This is also completely up to you. For example, you can set this to be 5 minutes or 5 months. Each time the content is viewed, Share will check the blockchain to see if the viewer still has access. Once the time is up, they'll need to pay again to experience the content.\n11. **Blockchain.** You’ll see \"Polygon Mainnet” auto-populated in the Blockchain field. This is the blockchain that we're going to use to store the contract for the content. As we noted earlier, we're using Polygon because it is fast, inexpensive, and fully compatible with Ethereum. \n12. **Cloud.** This is the backend infrastructure platform used to serve the content file globally. GCP is the default value, but this will be configurable such that you can specify your own server in the future if you'd like to. Please read the [Terms of Service](https://formless.xyz/terms) (ToS) with regard to hosting uploaded content. Share does not have the ability to modify or revoke smart contract assets deployed through the service, however we reserve the right to suspend content *hosting* associated with these contracts. This means if your contract violates the ToS, we will not serve the associated content, and it is your responsibility to update your deployed smart contract with a new URI which points to a Share protocol compliant host.\n13. **Review.** This displays the amount that it will cost to create and deploy the contract to blockchain. You’ll need to have at least this amount of MATIC tokens in your wallet for the transaction to process.\n14. **Deploy.** Select “Create”.  This will create your smart contract. You’ll see a message in your wallet asking you to verify the transaction. Once you’ve verified your transaction will process and result in your smart contract deployed on the blockchain. \n15. **Completion.** Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed a smart contract on blockchain that is ready for distribution. You can select the link to view your content, or you can copy/past the link to share it with potential customers. \n16. **More.** Read about how you can [Send text messages with smart contract links](https://placholder).\n\n\n---\n\nWant more detail?

This project is the first time a decentralized automation protocol for NFTs and blockchain games has been deployed.\n\nThe game integrates multiple automation features to achieve [autonomous NFTs (aNFTs)](https://mirror.xyz/0x6B87AbC02Fc4E2406219C69ecE0280ca39476b31/6wGjQ-Saz4YUISqx3oXS1tQXLLOdXaC_WfFYKlqoq-Y), and for the first time, on-chain non-playable characters (NPCs). aNFTs are an iteration of NFTs that have the ability to vote, fund, and even transfer themselves thanks to the automation capabilities of the Autonomy protocol. MetaDungeon is also the first blockchain game that requires players to be collaborative and rely on team mechanics, incorporating other NFT projects which players own as an essential part of gameplay.\n\n\"The vast majority of characters in Web2 games like Cyberpunk 2077 or World of Warcraft are NPCs that interact with each other or the player independently,” says James Key, Founder and CEO of Autonomy. “Through the development of aNFTs, it is now possible to build these types of engaging characters a blockchains. This represents a watershed moment for blockchain gaming and metaverses to build the types of games that generations of gamers are familiar with, and vastly expand the variety of games that can be built on blockchains.\"\n\n## How to participate in MetaDungeon\n\nThe MetaDungeon game consists of Heroes and Bosses, where all Bosses are aNFTs and each player is a Hero NFT. Heroes team up to fight world Bosses (aNFTs) and score loot worth real money. Players interact with 3 sets of NFTs: Heroes, the players in the game; Bosses, who the Heroes fight; and Gear, the unique items that Bosses drop. Players have the opportunity to earn loot from killing each Boss in the form of NFTs and tokens, which a Boss holds. Holding a Player NFT and defeating a boss is all that’s needed to receive loot.\n\nPlayers will be able to obtain a Hero NFT via the Genesis Drop, which will happen in three phases.\n\n* Phase one: Sign up for the [mintlist form](https://form.typeform.com/to/u2RioRYq?typeform-source=blog.autonomynetwork.io) to secure guaranteed access to mint at least one Hero on August 9, 2022.\n* Phase two: Allowlisted communities (who already hold certain yet-to-be-revealed NFTs) will have a chance to mint an NFT on August 10, 2022, on a first come first serve basis.\n* Phase three: There may be a Hero NFT public sale down the line during which anyone will be able to get their hands on the remaining collection of Hero NFTs – if there are any left standing.", "timestamp": 1659036364, "digest": "ATUviwtf37WV2sCcZnHoUCJ7GBUVF1Kza6P2HTLqeoE", "contributor": "0x9C00Beae824b9f7eD84704012f3d245992F81601"}

Approximately every 30 minutes, 10 validators are randomly chosen to run the network. Nodes (known as bundlers) are used to bundle multiple layer 2 transactions into a single Arweave (layer 1) transaction.\n\n# RUN A BUNDLR VALIDATOR ON TESTNET- JULY 2022\n\n[Bundlr Testnet](https://medium.com/bundlr-network/bundlr-launches-its-first-testnet-4bedd76e7c) is now live. You must use a domain or static IP, dynamic IPs will cause your validator to become undiscoverable. This guide is assuming a fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n\nHardware Specs:\n\n* Memory: 8 GB RAM\n* CPU: Quad-Core\n* Disk: 250 GB SSD Storage\n* Bandwidth: 1 Gbps for Download/100 Mbps for Upload\n\n## 1.

With the release of the Shimmer beta, projects will be pushing the limits of its features. With the following Shimmer mainnet, smart contract functionality, and a little bit of luck, we will see an explosion of dApps hurling themselves into the Shimmer universe.\n\nThe job of ecosystem development within the Iota Foundation is to make this bang as loud as possible.\n\nFor transparency, I thought I’d take a second to explain this effort and my involvement in it.\n\n*Note: everything here is from my own point of view and doesn’t necessarily reflect the opinions of other within the Iota Foundation or even in the Touchpoint crew. It’s also very much a joint effort and I’m just one of many trying to build the best ecosystem possible.*\n\n# A bit about myself\n\nAdam / [@Schpoopel](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel) here. My first interaction with cryptocurrency was installing — and subsequently forgetting — the Bitcoin mining software on my computer in 2010. I’m not sure it even fully synced to the network.\n\nIt wasn’t until 7 years later that I purchased my first bitcoin.\n\nDuring this time I was schlepping around the globe as an army aviation officer. After nearly a decade of this, I went back to university. Yet, this weird hobby with magic internet money kept pulling at my attention…\n\nI was keeping an ear to the themes of crypto, playing around in different ecosystems, trading my way up (…and down), minting NFTs, falling for the odd scam, and thinking about decentralization and the difference between innovation and vaporware. Eventually I gave in and focused on crypto full-time.\n\nMy first professional assignment in crypto was spent scribbling and designing educational courses for [ZeFi](https://zefi.com/en), which aims to bring crypto knowledge to the Arabic-speaking world. Luckily for me, their content is also in English (my Arabic doesn’t get much past *habibi*). During my tenure there, we wrote beginner courses on blockchain, smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs, while participating in talks on the social impacts of distributed ledger technology. I also traveled a bit to help spread the good word.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Schpoopel/status/1524764276413636609](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel/status/1524764276413636609)\n\nLater, I was fortunate enough to get picked up as an ecosystem developer by the Iota Foundation, which I’d followed since I initially drifted into the crypto space. The task at hand: contribute to a flourishing and robust universe of decentralized applications (dApps) built with Iota smart contracts.\n\n# “Ecosystem Developer”\n\nA job title as equally ambiguous in crypto discords as at family dinners (on par with “consultant”), one could be forgiven for assuming I’m either doing something for the environment or programming. While I enjoy those things, the job *instead* entails building up a network of applications that are usable, useful, economically sustainable, and even fun.\n\nSometimes this effort involves learning lessons from other protocols, e.g. when examining how Avalanche’s daily active users (DAUs) got up the slope (unaltered [source](https://messari.io/article/state-of-avalanche-q1-2022)):\n\n![I may have added too many red lines](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bwbS_Ik7sdkmzRJm0P7BW.png?height=511&width=914)\n\nAt other times, I’m reaching out to payment gateways (Simplex, Transak, etc.) to see how we can get a fiat-on ramp onto the native Firefly wallet.\n\nRegardless of the task — of which there are many — everything revolves around making Shimmer and Assembly as successful as possible. Perhaps nowhere is this effort more evident than in our open builder's program, Touchpoint.\n\n# Builders. Investors. Experts.\n\nTouchpoint was designed late last year and officially [announced](https://blog.assembly.sc/introducing-touchpoint/) in March 2022. A product of [Dan](https://twitter.com/DanSimerman), [Corey](https://twitter.com/CoreyST_), and [Christian](https://twitter.com/christiansaur2), the vision was to create a dedicated space for builders to work together while getting hands-on support from the IF and connect to investors. You can think of it as a mix between being a cohort-based accelerator (a la Y-Combinator) and an ecosystem hub. Such a space, involving recent multichain converts and pioneers of Iota tech alike, allows us to find and remove common obstacles between the projects.\n\nOur “hands on support” can take the form of introducing projects to potential partner dApps, investors, or a slew of experts ranging from product designers to code auditors. We’ve even met up personally with some of these projects at Iota meetups and at the Berlin office to talk through their roadmaps.\n\nSome other activities that have gone on in Touchpoint are:\n\n* **Networking**: We made connections with law firms and smart contract auditors, to find cost-effective solutions for project teams. Projects have also coordinated among themselves and with IF members on ideas for e.g. DeFi educational platforms.\n* **Fundraising**: We advised projects on their fundraising strategies (developers don’t work for free after all…), discussed valuations, and reviewed a hefty stack of pitch decks.\n* **Communications**: Suz ran an excellent communications workshop, and the projects have since had 1:1 assistance with her on their their comms strategy. We’ve also helped them gain exposure via blog articles and retweets.\n* **Product studio**: The Iota design studios held a community call and worked individually with UI / UX / product strategy among the projects.\n* **Technical Support**: Ani, our developer advocate, and some from the Iota Smart Contract team have been in close contact with many of the projects in the discord, allowing them to prepare their dApps for deployment.\n\nIn these aspects, Touchpoint is unique in the crypto space; we simply do not find this level of support, open communications, and networking in other ecosystems (…we asked around).\n\nThis is also a lot of work! Christian has the honor of managing **over one-hundred-fifty channels in the discord**… This spans around 50 groups, all of which are at different developmental stages (from ideation to launch). Besides the general chat rooms, there are chats with each project, investor, expert, and matchmaking channels where we introduce projects to each other. You know all those “we at \\[X\\] are proud to announce a partnership with \\[Y\\]”? You can thank him for some of those.\n\nThis isn’t to mention the telegram groups we facilitate between, say, a project and an outside auditing firm. Lastly, there’s the screening, which involves 30 minute calls with the projects to make sure they are seriously building something relevant for the ecosystem. Multiply this by 200 applicants, and our time gets filled up very fast.\n\nBecause of that, we expanded the team. Even while many VCs went “risk-off” with their capital and tech layoffs abound, the Touchpoint team took me on board in February. More recently, [Austin](https://twitter.com/bandalof17) joined up as has been focusing on outreach into other ecosystems. If you need a reason to be optimistic about how seriously we take Shimmer, here you go.\n\n# The State of the DAppspace\n\nMeanwhile, teams have had their heads down in development mode. Even as the IF fine tunes the Shimmer mainnet, many projects have claimed a piece of this universe for themselves. These include DEXs, wallets with in-app payments, lending protocols, yield aggregators, metaverses, meme projects, domain name services, NFT marketplaces, launchpads, DAOs, infrastructure projects on the level of Alchemy/Infura, real-world asset platforms, and games. The full list can be found [here](https://shimmer.network/ecosystem).\n\n*I should note that not all of these projects are working with Touchpoint. This is of course ok! If a project team wants to go on their own and not be a part of Touchpoint, more power to them. But we’re here if you need us. :)*\n\n![Shimmer on, you crazy diamonds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eyoFS6YItMn2IZzn-1hFn.png?height=537&width=813)\n\nIt is not only dApps that are popping up. We also have [seriously](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj013MZSgIOlUdi9Mzx51mw) [informative ](https://open.spotify.com/show/387nS9czdx47kJZ6Mho28m)[and](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0Tr-pPipB-dg0ISaiUlIw) [funny](https://www.youtube.com/c/SpecWeekly) content producers spicing the place up (and this is only the English content!). Thanks to these creators, our message is starting to build and propagate. People are becoming aware about feeless native assets & NFTs on the layer 1, unchained liquidity between layers and smart contract chains, and our composable architecture.\n\n# Going Forward\n\nIs that all? Well, no, we are also in looking into bringing oracles, bridges, indexers, stablecoins, block explorers, blue-chip dApps, and multi-signature wallets into the ecosystem. I can’t spoil anything here, but I can say that some of these conversations are already months in the making.\n\nWithin the Touchpoint program, we are working to source more funding for projects. One of our biggest challenges has been to get capital flowing to projects during a year when 2/3 of the crypto market dried up. Fear not! We are connecting with more investors, and converting older connections to the Shimmer vision.\n\nTouchpoint will increasingly leverage its role as a coordinator to host events within the server, as well as helping the project teams broadcast their events outside of it. From these, the community can expect more talks, demos, and generally more awareness for the dApps and the ecosystem at large.\n\nWill it all be enough to outshine (✨outshimmer?✨) the [hundreds](https://chainlist.org/) of EVM-compatible networks in existence? We’re doing all we can on that front, but part of this relies on you too, dear reader. Here’s how to get involved:\n\n* coordinate meetups / Stammtische and invite your favorite IF member\n* get involved on the [Iota Governance Forum](https://govern.iota.org/)\n* vote in Firefly\n* [apply](https://airtable.com/shrxW5Fs6NGDOkkBv) for Touchpoint\n* register your project on the [ecosystem page](https://shimmer.network/ecosystem)\n* listen out for the community calendar\n* follow [any](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel) [of](https://twitter.com/DanSimerman) [us](https://twitter.com/CoreyST_) [on](https://twitter.com/christiansaur2) [twitter](https://twitter.com/bandalof17) (or [on](https://medium.com/@christiansaur) [medium](https://simerman.medium.com/))\n* invite us to your twitter space, online event, podcast\n* keep building\n* don’t be a stranger\n\nFor my part, I will be available on discord and twitter. Feel free to ping me to talk ecosystem dev stuff! Perhaps you know of a project we should be looking at, or just want to know where our attention currently is.\n\nUntil next time, I hope this gives some insight as to what is going on behind the scenes and how we plan on making the biggest boom in the crypto space.\n\nMay all your *wen’s* be *soon*. \n - Adam", "timestamp": 1659037050, "digest": "rfur0bC0hIec1nn-pZrHBvkqF8Yh8wlB0cXsRmHm7U0", "contributor": "0x654D34445eb7fe967aA95aAFC0C614592F43a33e"}

The Accelerator is the entry point to the network, and we’re so excited to welcome the next cohort of innovators to the Club.\n\n### The Network as Seed Club’s “Secret Sauce”\n\nTokens give communities superpowers. As we discover these superpowers, we need high-signal and agile sensemaking networks to navigate crypto’s high-velocity innovation. Seed Club’s defining asset is our unmatched network of alumni, collaborators, and contributors.\n\nThe network’s value was made clear during the emergent selection process for SC04, where over 65 alumni, collaborators, and contributors stood up the *[autonymous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autonymous#:\\~:text=Definition%20of%20autonymous,used%20of%20symbols%20and%20expressions)* TomaDAO: a working group assembled for the sole purpose of selecting the next great Accelerator cohort. While we put them in the Telegram group chat together, they identified that chat as a community - and gave it a name. \\[Why TomaDAO? Stay with us: Accelerator selection process → the network as Seed Club’s secret sauce → tomato sauce? → the “Rotten Tomatoes” of web3? → TomaDAO (🍅,🍅).\\]\n\n![TomaDAO Genesis ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fsf65zuqlpscTE6TpfrYt.png?height=1000&width=2000)\n\n**TomaDAO was an experiment in a community-driven selection process.** The selection committee engaged in the rigorous work of reviewing and vetting applications, curating a shortlist of applicants for $CLUB holders to vote on. Here’s what we learned from our first TomaDAO season:\n\n* Collaborators and alumni are eager to lean in.\n* Collaborators and alumni enjoy being in community. The emergent connections demonstrated the possibility for deeper community-building.\n* Our most effective selection mechanism to date is the thoughtful and nuanced application reviews provided by experienced builders.\n* There was information asymmetry between TomaDAO members and $CLUB holders, and we want to integrate $CLUB holders into the process earlier on.\n* We want more community members involved during the application review process, but how do we *thoughtfully* scale?\n\n### The Next Selection Experiment: $CLUB Holders, We’re Looking at You\n\n[After we closed SC04, we took an extended break](https://club.mirror.xyz/lNcmjU7u8y9oV0hSD1dUc9vqEWE0UcvBighIpVudG2U) to retro the Accelerator from end-to-end, including our selection process. Over the past three months, the Accelerator working group, in deep collaboration with the Product working group, left no stone unturned exploring ways to improve the selection process for SC05.\n\n![How It Started](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YGD1Kg9hvc4BEdloKPzhg.png?height=1356&width=2290)\n\nAfter multiple [feedback sessions and design jams](https://www.figma.com/file/brPs0D4gt7nCoUhYTvVghc/SC05-Selection-Process?node-id=0%3A1), our next experiment emerged – our internal Call to Adventure for the SC05 selection process: **scalable community selection mechanisms**. We arrived at two critical first principles:\n\n1. *DAO teams have the ability to engage with the community in real time as they review applications.* DAO teams want the ability to edit, access, and update their applications.\n2. *$CLUB holders have full visibility and engagement on applications.* The community participates in boosting and exploring all aspects of the DAO’s application to provide informed and thoughtful input. This addresses the previous information asymmetry between TomaDAO members and $CLUB holders.\n\nThe result of our break is a two-part improvement for SC05: a refreshed Accelerator experience (more info next week), and refined application and selection processes.\n\n### Enter: The Accelerator Portal\n\nOur TomaDAO selection committee is back for SC05, but this time with one crucial differentiator: **$CLUB holders now have the same level of application insight, with the ability to review and engage with applicants as they’re applying.** This is all made possible by The Accelerator Portal, which is intentionally built to serve both Accelerator applicants and the $CLUB community.\n\nHere are the key components of The Accelerator Portal and how it enables a scalable community-driven selection process:\n\n* **Visible & Comprehensive Applications:** The Portal allows applicants to build a more comprehensive profile, providing context to those who need it most: $CLUB holders, fellow applicants, TomaDAO members, and the Seed Club team.\n* **Application Discovery:** Submitting an application publishes it to the Portal. The Portal’s landing page provides a real-time view of the latest applicants. $CLUB holders discover and boost new applicants as they apply.\n* **Boosts & Comments:** Each applicant profile integrates boosts and comments. Boosts are a way to signal community excitement for potential cohort members. The comment section is a way for $CLUB holders to gather more information and/or send some love. Applicants respond to comments in real time, and make adjustments to their application if they choose.\n\n### Three-Phase Selection Process\n\nThe selection process for SC05 occurs over three phases:\n\n1. Phase 1: Applications - 8/1 to 8/15\n   1. Applications for SC05 open on August 1, submitted via The Portal. Applicants respond to comments in real time, and make adjustments to their application through August 15 if they choose.\n2. Phase 2: Community Input - 8/1 to 8/22\n   1. $CLUB holders and the Seed Club team review the applications as they’re submitted. Reviewers boost up to 20 applications and continue using the comment feature to ask clarifying questions and/or send some love.\n3. Phase 3: Interviews - 8/22 to 8/26\n   1. The TomaDAO selection committee creates a shortlist of the most promising applicants based on community input. These applicants advance to the interview round. Cohort acceptance letters go out on September 12, with the public announcement to follow.\n\n### Sensemake With Us\n\nEach time we run this process, our network grows, and becomes more interconnected, more opinionated and more engaged. The selection process is just the beginning of the long journey we commit to with each project we bring into Seed Club. **We are entrusting you, our community, with the responsibility of sharing thoughtful, constructive feedback and asking questions that help projects improve and tighten their applications.** We are eager to engage many of you in this next round of experiments, to learn from your insights, and to be inspired to find even more ways to engage and collaborate with you in the future.", "timestamp": 1659037226, "digest": "g2th0wiPrRVkv8dLp9CFfMBAjYN9gZi3gI2PmXrNg3Q", "contributor": "0x751077DfD4942aA28985bAA850f4C648d241C863"}
{"id": "ykalV51FEhTFmgoa6pYkBctpn8YOsETmNIfkY5D7Zhc", "title": "01. How to solve World Hunger in 30 days", "body": "**01.   World Hunger**\n\nSo, I want to talk about how I was tossing and turning in bed the other night, and what I was thinking during those brief moments of being on the line between awake or asleep as I flipped from sleeping on my side to my front, and probably back. What I was thinking, was about how to solve world hunger in a practical sense. One word popped out and stuck with me. The word is **redistribution**. If you’ve been incessantly thinking about how its absolutely crazy that at least 820 million people, and rising, are suffering from hunger that we call “world hunger”, and yet four times enough food to feed them just rots every year, please hit me up! I need a support group. I’m not coping well at all with this. I mean, the food just rots. Its not like anyone is evening making money off that rotting food, or am I mistaken? Packaged, untouched food. Anyway, that brings me back to redistribution. Come on this journey with me. At each level of a product’s lifecycle, the holder needs to know how much is too much. I don’t buy more food than I know I’ll eat, and that feels like common sense because why overdo it on purpose and happily throw food away? That’s weird and upsetting to me. And if I ever have food that I know I won’t finish or open, giving it away takes first priority. That’s the energy we need throughout the product chain. When shops overbuy stocks, the surplus can be redistributed within a good space of time. I’ve seen supermarkets still have crates of eggs on their shelves two days before the expiry date, and I honestly wonder what they do with all those eggs after no one buys them. Its clearly old stock and I feel they should’ve known they had too much and redistributed them to those in need. That’s the energy we need, and we need it to scale up to warehouses where the food is first stored in bulk before distribution. After the shops improve their orders to match their demand, leftover food will now be redistributable directly from the warehouses. The same way the food gets to supermarkets, is the same way it should get to the *foodmarkets* for these people in need. Give the people free food. The only reason they don’t have food is because it costs money and they’re not making enough of it, if any. We are living in a world where food is thrown away and people are left to starve. This redistribution solution is really easy to implement and mainly relies on the availability of transportation. Eradicating world hunger is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, so I’m sure a world hunger fund can more than pay for the transportation that will be required. That shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nAnd oh, I shouldn’t leave out the producers. Producers are a very important part of the product lifecycle. They are where it all begins. Production centres that are overproducing need to be identified and regulated accordingly, because overproducing to this degree is harmful to the global collective by depleting our finite water and land resources.\n\nOkay, that’s world hunger solved. People in supply chain management, a group of people knowledgeable on the geographic spread and respective degrees of hunger, and the UN, need to meet and hash out the technicalities. One month of dedicated effort and this is solved. Among us, we’ve got the expertise to make that happen. I don’t know how to get that message to them, but this feels like a good start and its very nice to have a clear and describable solution to present.\n\nWhat’s next on the solution stage, climate change? Ouuuu - that rhymed. I liked that.\n\n(If you would like to support me + my continued development of solutions and perhaps even their implementation, I would appreciate that.)", "timestamp": 1659036968, "digest": "ANWwfgCNIABf6197aWT3MipIBckBxEISi7pnV3jmuYI", "contributor": "0x37a46Af45325A05797D691a65283393bD84b33D8"}

Tam has appreciated users of the testnet version providing feedback and battle testing.\n\nJrocki read white paper and was one of the first in the discord\n\n**What are Putty and Cally?**\n\nPutty - options platform where you can buy and sell put options on NFTs and ERC 20 tokens.\nEnables you to hedge your risk and protect your downside for floor price dropping or token price dropping.\nFor example, if you have an NFT worth 1 eth, and are worried the price might drop, you could buy a put option for a small premium at a strike price of .5 eth for say 1 month. So, if the price of the NFT goes below 0.5 eth for the next month, you could exercise that option, and get 0.5 eth from whoever sold the option to you.\n\nCally - Cally is similar, but for call options instead of puts. enables you to selling covered calls on your NFTs by setting a specific duration and premium. Can be set based on a dutch option. If you set the parameters correctly, you can try to avoid being liquidated on your NFTs. Earn a premium on NFT by staking it in a vault and selling a call on it. You can ensure the other side of trade is far out of the money, so you can kind of earn yield.\n\nThey've done 50,000 worth of transactions. FloorDAO sold a bunch of puts to another organization that was wanting to protect themselves on the forgotten runes wizard cult NFT collection.\n\nIf you want to do something specific with Optimism tokens, reach out to Tam or jump in the Putty discord. They can help you find agreeable terms.\n\nFactors going into price / profit: Duration, strike price, volatility of the token / collection.\n\nVersion 2 of Putty will implement a model based on the Black-Scholes options pricing model, a mathematical method (using differential equations) to calculate the theoretical value of an option contract.\nThe Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility.\n\nThey are developing specifications for version 2.\n\nYou can create a generic floor NFT option. From on top of this, you could build an NFT index that tracks the prices of 5 different NFT collections.\nEnables structured financial products to be built on top of NFTs and ERC-20s, enabling inverstors easy access to ERC-20 and ERC-721 based derivatives.\nThis broadens and diversifies the type of financial portfolio that can be built in the realm of cryptocurrency.\n\nUse case for Putty: GameFI, users taking damage or health.

Its a way to avoid being liquidated on your NFTs, although there is still risk. \n\nUsers can seek to earn a premium on NFT by staking it in a vault and selling a call on it. \n\nPutty and Cally have done 50,000 worth of transactions. FloorDAO sold a bunch of puts to another organization that was wanting to protect themselves on the forgotten runes wizard cult NFT collection.\n\nLaunched in January and built in the Solidity programming language, Putty and Cally will both be on Ethereum mainnet and Optimism, although currently MVP stage.\n\nPutty and Cally were released testnet early in the development cycle - no gated or whitelist testnet required. Tam has appreciated users of the testnet version providing feedback and battle testing.\n\nIf you want to do something specific with Optimism tokens, reach out to Tam or jump in the Putty discord. They can help you find agreeable terms.\n\n**Putty Version 2:**\n\nThey are developing specifications for version 2.\n\nV2 of Putty will implement a model based on the [Black-Scholes options pricing model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp#:\\~:text=The%20Black%2DScholes%20model%2C%20aka,free%20rate%2C%20and%20the%20volatility.), a mathematical method (using differential equations) to calculate the theoretical value of an option contract.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model requires 5 inputs. These factors determine a user’s likelihood of turning a profit:\n\n* strike price of an option\n* current stock (or token) price\n* time to expiration (duration)\n* risk-free rate\n* volatility of the token of NFT collection\n\n**What can you do with this?**\n\nAn options protocol for ERC-20s and ERC-721 tokens will enable structured financial products to be built on top of these crypto assets, enabling retail crypto investors to access ERC-20 and ERC-721 based derivatives.\n\nThis will ultimately broaden and diversify the type of financial portfolio that can be built in the realm of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor example, a user could create a generic floor NFT option.\n\nOn top of an option based on the floor price of an NFT, you could build an NFT index that tracks the prices of a group of different NFT collections.\n\nImagine building an NFT based index fund that tracks the floor price of a set of blue-chip NFTs on mainnet - such as Crypto Punks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Xcopy, and Doodles.\n\nAnother use case for Putty is in GameFI, where users taking damage or health los. Loss of health impacts the price of the NFT when they go to sell it. To mitigate downside risk of damaging your in-game NFT, the user could buy a put option on the NFT before they engage in the task that can damage the price of the NFT. This is a way to hedge potential risk. \n\nA lot of Runescape players got interested in GameFI by way of selling characters and gold online. If we create Runescape on top of a blockchain, it could be a huge use case.\n\nTam is also stacking optipunks ahead of the OP airdrop\n\n## Quick takes from Jrocki and Espresso\n\n**Soul bound NFTs:** non-transferable and non-traceable.\n\n* ID cards, certificates of completion, building credibility\n* being non-tradeable, soulbound tokens are not getting the attention they deserve. \n* soulbound NFTs could facilitate uncollateralized loans, enabling people to building credibility ( similar to how a credit score is used by financial institutions to assess the risk of taking on an individual customer )\n\n**Optimism stats:** \n\n* gas is 95X cheaper on Optimism than Ethereum mainnet\n* Optimism gas was between 18-32 cents over the last week\n* 60,000 transactions per day, doubled in less than a year. \n* 200,000 unique users per day \n* OP token soon (had not launched yet)\n* 248,000 eligible wallet addresses for the OP airdrop\n\n**Hop Protocol**\n\n* HOP proposal allocated 1 million OP tokens to subsidize bridging costs for users. \n* every user that onboards using hop will have those fees paid back to them. \n* interaction with HOP protocol will enable you to earn OP rewards. \n\n**Cryptovania mint** - Quixotic created a direct fiat on-ramp to the website.", "timestamp": 1659039857, "digest": "n-pCfEEvLL4VPjBQUJJicn4rlHei0FLkSvZFa042i8o", "contributor": "0xb72D4D2337E1Cd3Cc20240467833209E97e6c469"}

To many this seems counterintuitive to sell below the price they paid, especially given their bullish long term stance on the digital asset.\n\nBut the accounting treatment forced their hand under the adverse macro economic conditions. If Tesla needed to sell its BTC reserves, then there will likely be additional public companies that need to dispose of their BTC holdings also. There’s systemic risk in the market with BTC dictating the direction of general crypto price action, so any large movements in BTC price action will have ripple effects across the entire ecosystem.\n\nThis article provides some context for the rationale behind the disposal and reviews the impact on the wider cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Article Outline\n\n* Tesla Background\n* Accounting Treatment Context\n* Benchmarking and Future Predictions\n* Closing Remarks\n\n## Tesla Background\n\nTesla leads the global EV industry with [14% of the market](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/global-electric-vehicles-sales-up-109-in-2021-tesla-leads-with-14-share-122021401485_1.html) share. The EV market has had huge growth in recent years, particularly in Europe and China. [China capitalized on first mover advantage, established itself as the worlds largest EV market](https://insideevs.com/news/342458/tesla-has-huge-opportunity-to-capitalize-on-chinas-booming-ev-market/) and are Tesla’s largest customer:\n\n![Source: IEA.org](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hDxyz3XLjPq80LMPuYUKP.png?height=1280&width=2642)\n\nTesla’s EV deliveries have been performing well, consistently with the wider EV market:\n\n![Source: Statista](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ghh0yXMhnHSstnpxF9uFT.png?height=892&width=1430)\n\nTesla’s H1 ‘22 deliveries are already on track to outpace the prior year, albeit slightly behind their ‘22 target due to fears of [further lockdowns in China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-07/shanghai-cases-jump-to-highest-since-may-fueling-lockdown-fears#xj4y7vzkg). The Shanghai lockdowns in April curbed Tesla’s EV production at their Chinese factory, while their European manufacturing plants were racing to be production ready. \n\nTesla continues to perform well, despite the adverse economic climate. They’re an innovative business that continues to push the boundaries of technology and have long been an advocate of cryptocurrency. The company acquired [$1.5 billion of BTC in February 2021](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm) when the price fluctuated between $30-$40k. Since then we’ve had a roller coaster, with blow off tops in May ($64k) and November 2021 ($67k), then a tumble to $17.6k in June 2022. As of writing the BTC price is $23k USD, down 72% from all time highs.\n\nTesla stated in their 2021 SEC filings that:\n\n*“we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.”*\n\nSince then the EV maker had halted payments in cryptocurrency, citing concerns over climate change given the Proof of Work (“PoW”) mechanism of validating transactions on the BTC network. Refer to the Ethereum merge [OriginsNFT article for discussion around Proof of Stake (“PoS”) versus PoW networks](https://mirror.xyz/origins-research.eth/gD3covhDDf1T3HjBWUgvvGSO7aheexZCT_NVMTr9NJ4).\n\n[Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) stated he is open to boosting Tesla’s BTC exposure in the future. We should however take this with a pinch of salt as it could pivot depending on Tesla’s financial position and the macro market conditions. \n\nLet’s take a look at why the accounting treatment plays a large part in the BTC disposal for Tesla and other publicly listed companies.\n\n## Accounting Treatment Context\n\nTesla’s BTC holdings are accounted for as a digital asset (intangible) under *[ASC 350](https://asc.fasb.org/imageRoot/76/120327576.pdf) (Intangibles - Goodwill and Other)*. We can see this is consistent with the their policy disclosed in their financial statements (extract below). Fancy words, but what does it mean?\n\n![Source: Tesla Q2 Shareholder Report](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JrisNi2J4uiAYBpKHY06d.png?height=318&width=2850)\n\nWell, if you were to purchase BTC at $60k and it fell to $30k, then the fair value (quoted market price) is below the amount you paid, so there’s an indication of impairment. You would need to write down your BTC holdings by 50% in this example - A one off loss to the income statement!\n\nBut surely if the price goes up you can recognize the up side? In short, no you cannot. If the BTC price goes up and you’re in need of cash, it forces your hand to realize any profits since the adverse impairment charge has already been incurred. That’s what Tesla has done here. \n\nLet’s take a look a their recent numbers (baring in mind these are unaudited, hopefully no misstatements hiding in the woodwork!):\n\n![Source: Tesla Q2 Shareholder Report](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f3Il7ZYwJARxf7n7azZds.png?height=1096&width=2116)\n\n### Tesla Numbers TL;DR\n\nThis is based on a comparison of Q2 ‘22 and Q4 ‘21, given this was the last audited (more reliable) ‘Balance Sheet’:\n\n* Digital assets fallen by $1b - the BTC disposal amount\n* Cash increased by c$0.8b partly from BTC disposal\n* Inventory increase, possibly due to EV sales slowdown from China lockdowns and continued production from European plants\n* PPE increase likely involving further manufacturing infrastructure investment\n* Current liabilities increased slightly, may be due to stretching their payment terms given adverse macro climate or price of Lithium increasing so larger raw material cost\n* Further improved equity position attributable to continued net profits from operations\n\nDid Tesla need to sell their BTC? No - they’re in a very healthy position. But capitalizing on the up side of BTC disposal is logical when the macro conditions are not optimal. \n\nWhile there was nothing unsurprising coming out of the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) it is likely that there will be more hawkish actions taken in the future, so planning for the worst is a sensible strategy - cash is king in a bear market after all. [@omega_eth provides a good thread on the the FOMC meeting.](https://twitter.com/omega_eth/status/1552538290343276544?s=20&t=fAlMMGngMVd4Sw_yBOQxdQ) \n\nSo if Tesla has taken this approach, what will other publicly listed companies do? Let’s take a look.\n\n## Benchmarking and Future Predictions\n\nThis BTC accounting treatment is relevant for all other US regulated companies. In fact many of the global companies follow similar treatment under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). \n\nTesla is the first, but suspect they will not be the last. In fact it is probable that more companies will do this over the coming months, particularly those that are in stressed financial positions and bought BTC at higher prices. What does this mean to the price of BTC? Well there will be additional sell pressure and if there are several large institutions that need to liquidate holdings at once then this could cause a sudden dump in the price, exacerbated by liquidations from leverage in the market.\n\nWith this in mind lets take a look at some of the publicly listed (subject to these accounting standards) companies with large BTC holdings:\n\n![Source: Decrypt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pd_BNbkNA8RuTONsyWYiT.png?height=602&width=1102)\n\n[Microstrategy](https://twitter.com/MicroStrategy) is the largest holder of BTC, as far as public companies are concerned. We know that they are very bullish on BTC and have [sufficient collateral to allow the price of BTC to fall to $3,562](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/bitcoin-microstrategy-denies-it-received-margin-call-against-silvergate-loan.html) before they are margin called. They are unlikely to sell given it would go against everything Micheal Saylor (Microstrategy CEO) has advocated for, but if there is pressure from the investors then it’s not an impossible outcome.\n\nThe remaining top 10 hold less than 80k BTC (equivalent to 62% of Microstrategy’s holdings). Voyager Digital recently declared bankruptcy and is currently receiving takeover [offers from the likes of FTX](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/25/is-ftx-proposal-offering-voyager-customers-a-good-deal-one-bankruptcy-experts-weighs-in/) to acquire the business. Depending on how this resolves itself we could see some movement in their BTC reserves as they settle their liabilities.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture, we can review the distribution of BTC holdings by wallet as from the [Bitinfo-charts](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html):\n\n![Source: bitinfocharts.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5csPPMqjcOrBj9vW2sByE.png?height=612&width=1416)\n\nOnly five public companies have more than 10k BTC holdings, whereas there are another 91 wallets with more than 10k BTC. This suggests there are private companies, governments and high net worth individuals that also hold this amount in their reserves, that may not be subject to the same accounting standards.\n\nSo while we see the news that a public company with large BTC holdings has sold their reserves, the price impact is more likely from markets reacting to the news as opposed to the actual price action from the disposal. The BTC was probably sold over the counter rather than on exchange, or at least a combination of the two. In fact 62% of BTC is held in 15,867 wallets, each with more than 100 BTC. The minimal price action (1.7% movement) after the Tesla announcement wasn’t a particularly big swing for crypto volatility.\n\nWhile BTC currently dictates the price trend in crypto, we could see a change with the Ethereum merge expected to go live from September 2022. There may be a decoupling between Ether and BTC following the fundamental shift in supply / demand mechanics for Ether. Refer to the [OriginsNFT article](https://mirror.xyz/origins-research.eth/gD3covhDDf1T3HjBWUgvvGSO7aheexZCT_NVMTr9NJ4) for more information on the merge.\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nThe rationale for Tesla’s disposal of its BTC holdings seems reasonable, however we will likely see a number of other publicly listed companies make similar disposals if they anticipate liquidity issues. Particularly given these large corporates have probably already incurred the down side from booking the impairment losses, given the accounting requirements. \n\nThe current accounting standards for BTC as an intangible asset may end up driving business decisions that seem counterintuitive, and potentially counterproductive. Adding unnecessary sell pressure in the market. Further hawkish action from the Federal Reserve could lead to more liquidity issues and poor corporate performance. This could drive crypto prices down further, until something breaks, or the market sentiment shifts.\n\nWe are navigating uncharted waters in both macro and the crypto market. Past cycles can be used to help predict future price action, although there are a combination of several variables that make this experience novel. Buckle up - it’s going to be a volatile and potentially unpredictable ride. Either way, while there is a slight bear market rally underway I suspect there is more downside in the short to medium term, before we resume an upward trend on longer timeframes.\n\nAt [OriginsNFT](https://originsnft.io/) we leverage data-driven decision making, educational resources, and proprietary analytics to remain ahead of the curve with respect to blockchain tech and specifically NFTs.
