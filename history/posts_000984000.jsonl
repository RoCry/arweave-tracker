{"id": "N4WISA9E8rd69o34HG_TfK7TFqaHWIQBGbfd7JdPGSo", "title": "$ENIOLA 04: Building in a Bear Market", "body": "*Hey peeps, this is the first update post Launch House + NFT.NYC. Last month there was a focus on launching, launching and launching. For the most part, a unique blend of resources, connections and timelines were in-line to act as a launchpad for various projects (entrepreneurial and personal). It’s been well documented that current market conditions have put a spanner in the works for many start-ups, scale-ups and other builders. Some of my friends have lost the majority of their net worth, whilst others have now entered the job market. In these unprecedented times, the sentiment of many people on crypto Twitter is just to hunker down and build. But reality for the majority doesn’t allow for such basic and unthoughtful advice. All I can say is do what you can to get through the bear market. Get that job AND build, support your family AND build, take care of your body and mind AND build. To be comfortable building a startup in any market condition is some form of privilege in itself; something that builders and investors forget sometimes. Build if it makes sense. Do not be roped in by the simple platitudes you see online.*\n\nI think that’s my most extended introduction to any of my updates thus far → lets' dive in!\n\n### Month In Retrospect\n\n* I wrapped up a month in New York as part of Launch House, Founders House Summer 2022 Cohort (yes, it’s a long title). I had an amazing time there, built connections, had fun and learnt a lot. You can read [articles](https://eniola.mirror.xyz) and view [tweets](https://twitter.com/elijah_ajuwon/status/1528877678115586048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1528877678115586048%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Feniola.mirror.xyz%2FA2MwquHQCIlQtTEsTyHJpvtMcDORoeHaisy0a-ZEetw) about my experiences.\n* I attended NFT.NYC for the first time as well, it was a good conference with amazing speakers from the biggest VCs and founders of some of the biggest web3 startups. However, I found that there was more value in the satellite events and after-parties, for me personally. I think I may end up applying to speak at the conference next year.\n* A demo for early.fans can be viewed on our [notion wiki](https://earlyfans.notion.site/early-fans-wiki-7e45427b91d74f29b2889e11b4120386). There you can get to grips with the looks and feel of the first iteration of our MVP.\n* We started having meetings with VCs, from both the United Kingdom and States. As mentioned before this is a numbers game. Each VC has different theses and methods. I have received varying advice from the firms; some of which conflicting but it’s important to build with users, make sure there’s a market and get some early traction. Someone will eventually take the first leap.\n* There were no proposals for $ENIOLA holders to vote on this month. Monthly proposals will make a come-back.\n\n### Biggest Takeaways\n\n* Right now I am unwavering. Even with these market conditions and personal circumstances, my first thought is what can I do to continue building. Do I get a job? Do I split the raise? Who do I partner with or reach out to? Should I relocate? My game plan may have changed but the goal hasn’t.\n* I want to feel small again. When I was in New York, I was constantly being reminded of how unremarkable and small I was. Now I know the language is dramatic and don’t worry I am not going through a quarter-life or identity crisis, it is just impossible for me to be comfortable with my achievements or goals. Some of my peers are doing amazing things. I know that comparison is the death of joy, but I what I took from this was the difference in my personal mentality and drive when around a certain type of individual. \n\n### What’s Next\n\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n* \\[redacted\\]\n\n*To view the redacted content please buy some $ENIOLA you can reach out to me or buy it on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet).*\n\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nTo the builders (in whatever capacity) reading this,c sondier your environment. When this type of discourse happens people typically focus on their friends and WHO they are surrounded by. However, what is equally important is WHAT are you surrounded by. What resources do you have access to? What infrastructure has been set up in your location? What ecosystems are you plugged into? The whats are as equally important as the whys.", "timestamp": 1659034956, "digest": "d3RTD4bbrAJZ1QZzCFnuZpQYhvcWujabklEYi4o6t-0", "contributor": "0xE314f925f05c8f5e4063Dd19684992196f5d89D9"}
{"id": "GQcOI9zqyI7sps8NdG6wS5LP_oqGjAXODpgqy2ZIOLw", "title": "Deploy your first smart contract to distribute your video on blockchain", "body": "Share is a protocol and dApp built on blockchain that enables creators to choose the price per stream of their audio or video content, distribute the content directly to consumers, make it accessible on any web application, and receive payments instantly when their content is streamed. Share has a wide variety of applications including music, video, and podcasts.\n\n*This article overviews the process to **deploy a VIDEO on blockchain with SHARE** and provides example information that you can use to test out the process.*\n\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIn the *[Share User Guide](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-user-guide)* you can find the general requirements to use Share. This includes [selecting and setting up a Web3 wallet](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-pre-release-user-guide/select-and-setup-a-wallet) and [connecting to the Share dApp](https://docs.formless.xyz/share-protocol/guides/share-dapp-user-guide/connect-to-the-dapp). If you haven’t already and are not familiar with some of the Web3 terminology and technology, please make sure you visit these sections and learn about what you’ll need to interact with Share.\n\n## Upload your video file and create a smart contract\n\n 1. **Video file.** Prepare a video file in MP4 format. MP4 is the most popular format for digital video. If you don't already have a video that you want to use for testing, you can use this [demo MP4 video](https://formless-eng.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/share-testvideo.mp4).\n 2. **Website location.** Navigate to <https://share.formless.xyz/create> in your web browser. Here you’ll see a series of steps where you will input information that is used to create the details of your smart contract.\n 3. **Creator Name.** Enter \"My Test Name\". This is the name you use to identify yourself, e.g. your artist name or your real name. This can be anything you choose, for example, you can do things like \"KANYE X JAY-Z\" if you'd like to list multiple names. Your content ownership is uniquely identified through your blockchain address, not the name entered here.\n 4. **Title.** Enter \"My Test Video Title\". Similar to the name field, this can be anything you want. The content will be uniquely identified using its smart contract address. This title is purely for display purposes.\n 5. **Upload.** Select \"Choose File\" and locate the test video MP4 file that we prepared above.\n 6. **Artwork and previews.** Select “Custom Artwork” and upload an image file that meets the file type and size requirements identified on screen. This image will appear as a thumbnail and as a screen cap on your video. Select “Custom Video Preview” and upload a video file that represent a segment of your full video content and meets the file type and size requirements identified on screen. Users will be able to play this content prior to purchasing access to your content. If your content is free, there’s no need to add the Custom Video preview since all of your content will play for free. \n 7. **Royalty Splits.** You’ll see your wallet address auto-populated in the Primary Owner field. When you start uploading content that has multiple creators, you can select the “Split Royalties” box, add addresses of other owners, identify their proportional share of royalties, and they’ll also be added as content owners in your smart contract. For now, keep this unchecked and proceed with yourself as the single owner of the content. This means revenues will flow to your address when the content is viewed.\n 8. **Price For Access.** Enter “0.25”. This means that viewers will need to pay 25 cents to watch your new video. The payment won't require them to enter any financial information, it will automatically flow from their wallet on the blockchain seamlessly. In this example, we're using 25 cents, but the beauty of Share is that you can set this value to be anything that you want. It can be 0 for free content, or any amount you wish, even $1M if that's what you think it's worth. You know your audience and the worth of your content better than we ever could.\n 9. **Apple and Google Pay.** Select “Enable Apple and Google Pay”. This will allow consumers to purchase access to your content using Apple Pay and Google Pay, and they won’t need to connect a Web3 wallet in order to purchase access to your content. This is an optional feature and is only available for content that is priced equal to or above 17 cents. There are a few additional fees ($.30 + 7.9% of the transaction value) that consumers will have to pay for the convenience of using Apple or Google Pay, but depending on your use case and how you’re pricing your content it may make sense.\n10. **Access Grant Time.** Enter 1 DAY, 0 HOURS, 0 MINUTES. This is the amount of time that the viewer will have access to your content after they complete the instant micro-payment. This is also completely up to you. For example, you can set this to be 5 minutes or 5 months. Each time the content is viewed, Share will check the blockchain to see if the viewer still has access. Once the time is up, they'll need to pay again to experience the content.\n11. **Blockchain.** You’ll see \"Polygon Mainnet” auto-populated in the Blockchain field. This is the blockchain that we're going to use to store the contract for the content. As we noted earlier, we're using Polygon because it is fast, inexpensive, and fully compatible with Ethereum. \n12. **Cloud.** This is the backend infrastructure platform used to serve the content file globally. GCP is the default value, but this will be configurable such that you can specify your own server in the future if you'd like to. Please read the [Terms of Service](https://formless.xyz/terms) (ToS) with regard to hosting uploaded content. Share does not have the ability to modify or revoke smart contract assets deployed through the service, however we reserve the right to suspend content *hosting* associated with these contracts. This means if your contract violates the ToS, we will not serve the associated content, and it is your responsibility to update your deployed smart contract with a new URI which points to a Share protocol compliant host.\n13. **Review.** This displays the amount that it will cost to create and deploy the contract to blockchain. You’ll need to have at least this amount of MATIC tokens in your wallet for the transaction to process.\n14. **Deploy.** Select “Create”.  This will create your smart contract. You’ll see a message in your wallet asking you to verify the transaction. Once you’ve verified your transaction will process and result in your smart contract deployed on the blockchain. \n15. **Completion.** Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed a smart contract on blockchain that is ready for distribution. You can select the link to view your content, or you can copy/past the link to share it with potential customers. \n16. **More.** Read about how you can [Send text messages with smart contract links](https://placholder).\n\n\n---\n\nWant more detail?

This project is the first time a decentralized automation protocol for NFTs and blockchain games has been deployed.\n\nThe game integrates multiple automation features to achieve [autonomous NFTs (aNFTs)](https://mirror.xyz/0x6B87AbC02Fc4E2406219C69ecE0280ca39476b31/6wGjQ-Saz4YUISqx3oXS1tQXLLOdXaC_WfFYKlqoq-Y), and for the first time, on-chain non-playable characters (NPCs). aNFTs are an iteration of NFTs that have the ability to vote, fund, and even transfer themselves thanks to the automation capabilities of the Autonomy protocol. MetaDungeon is also the first blockchain game that requires players to be collaborative and rely on team mechanics, incorporating other NFT projects which players own as an essential part of gameplay.\n\n\"The vast majority of characters in Web2 games like Cyberpunk 2077 or World of Warcraft are NPCs that interact with each other or the player independently,” says James Key, Founder and CEO of Autonomy. “Through the development of aNFTs, it is now possible to build these types of engaging characters a blockchains. This represents a watershed moment for blockchain gaming and metaverses to build the types of games that generations of gamers are familiar with, and vastly expand the variety of games that can be built on blockchains.\"\n\n## How to participate in MetaDungeon\n\nThe MetaDungeon game consists of Heroes and Bosses, where all Bosses are aNFTs and each player is a Hero NFT. Heroes team up to fight world Bosses (aNFTs) and score loot worth real money. Players interact with 3 sets of NFTs: Heroes, the players in the game; Bosses, who the Heroes fight; and Gear, the unique items that Bosses drop. Players have the opportunity to earn loot from killing each Boss in the form of NFTs and tokens, which a Boss holds. Holding a Player NFT and defeating a boss is all that’s needed to receive loot.\n\nPlayers will be able to obtain a Hero NFT via the Genesis Drop, which will happen in three phases.\n\n* Phase one: Sign up for the [mintlist form](https://form.typeform.com/to/u2RioRYq?typeform-source=blog.autonomynetwork.io) to secure guaranteed access to mint at least one Hero on August 9, 2022.\n* Phase two: Allowlisted communities (who already hold certain yet-to-be-revealed NFTs) will have a chance to mint an NFT on August 10, 2022, on a first come first serve basis.\n* Phase three: There may be a Hero NFT public sale down the line during which anyone will be able to get their hands on the remaining collection of Hero NFTs – if there are any left standing.", "timestamp": 1659036364, "digest": "ATUviwtf37WV2sCcZnHoUCJ7GBUVF1Kza6P2HTLqeoE", "contributor": "0x9C00Beae824b9f7eD84704012f3d245992F81601"}

Approximately every 30 minutes, 10 validators are randomly chosen to run the network. Nodes (known as bundlers) are used to bundle multiple layer 2 transactions into a single Arweave (layer 1) transaction.\n\n# RUN A BUNDLR VALIDATOR ON TESTNET- JULY 2022\n\n[Bundlr Testnet](https://medium.com/bundlr-network/bundlr-launches-its-first-testnet-4bedd76e7c) is now live. You must use a domain or static IP, dynamic IPs will cause your validator to become undiscoverable. This guide is assuming a fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n\nHardware Specs:\n\n* Memory: 8 GB RAM\n* CPU: Quad-Core\n* Disk: 250 GB SSD Storage\n* Bandwidth: 1 Gbps for Download/100 Mbps for Upload\n\n## 1.

With the release of the Shimmer beta, projects will be pushing the limits of its features. With the following Shimmer mainnet, smart contract functionality, and a little bit of luck, we will see an explosion of dApps hurling themselves into the Shimmer universe.\n\nThe job of ecosystem development within the Iota Foundation is to make this bang as loud as possible.\n\nFor transparency, I thought I’d take a second to explain this effort and my involvement in it.\n\n*Note: everything here is from my own point of view and doesn’t necessarily reflect the opinions of other within the Iota Foundation or even in the Touchpoint crew. It’s also very much a joint effort and I’m just one of many trying to build the best ecosystem possible.*\n\n# A bit about myself\n\nAdam / [@Schpoopel](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel) here. My first interaction with cryptocurrency was installing — and subsequently forgetting — the Bitcoin mining software on my computer in 2010. I’m not sure it even fully synced to the network.\n\nIt wasn’t until 7 years later that I purchased my first bitcoin.\n\nDuring this time I was schlepping around the globe as an army aviation officer. After nearly a decade of this, I went back to university. Yet, this weird hobby with magic internet money kept pulling at my attention…\n\nI was keeping an ear to the themes of crypto, playing around in different ecosystems, trading my way up (…and down), minting NFTs, falling for the odd scam, and thinking about decentralization and the difference between innovation and vaporware. Eventually I gave in and focused on crypto full-time.\n\nMy first professional assignment in crypto was spent scribbling and designing educational courses for [ZeFi](https://zefi.com/en), which aims to bring crypto knowledge to the Arabic-speaking world. Luckily for me, their content is also in English (my Arabic doesn’t get much past *habibi*). During my tenure there, we wrote beginner courses on blockchain, smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs, while participating in talks on the social impacts of distributed ledger technology. I also traveled a bit to help spread the good word.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Schpoopel/status/1524764276413636609](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel/status/1524764276413636609)\n\nLater, I was fortunate enough to get picked up as an ecosystem developer by the Iota Foundation, which I’d followed since I initially drifted into the crypto space. The task at hand: contribute to a flourishing and robust universe of decentralized applications (dApps) built with Iota smart contracts.\n\n# “Ecosystem Developer”\n\nA job title as equally ambiguous in crypto discords as at family dinners (on par with “consultant”), one could be forgiven for assuming I’m either doing something for the environment or programming. While I enjoy those things, the job *instead* entails building up a network of applications that are usable, useful, economically sustainable, and even fun.\n\nSometimes this effort involves learning lessons from other protocols, e.g. when examining how Avalanche’s daily active users (DAUs) got up the slope (unaltered [source](https://messari.io/article/state-of-avalanche-q1-2022)):\n\n![I may have added too many red lines](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bwbS_Ik7sdkmzRJm0P7BW.png?height=511&width=914)\n\nAt other times, I’m reaching out to payment gateways (Simplex, Transak, etc.) to see how we can get a fiat-on ramp onto the native Firefly wallet.\n\nRegardless of the task — of which there are many — everything revolves around making Shimmer and Assembly as successful as possible. Perhaps nowhere is this effort more evident than in our open builder's program, Touchpoint.\n\n# Builders. Investors. Experts.\n\nTouchpoint was designed late last year and officially [announced](https://blog.assembly.sc/introducing-touchpoint/) in March 2022. A product of [Dan](https://twitter.com/DanSimerman), [Corey](https://twitter.com/CoreyST_), and [Christian](https://twitter.com/christiansaur2), the vision was to create a dedicated space for builders to work together while getting hands-on support from the IF and connect to investors. You can think of it as a mix between being a cohort-based accelerator (a la Y-Combinator) and an ecosystem hub. Such a space, involving recent multichain converts and pioneers of Iota tech alike, allows us to find and remove common obstacles between the projects.\n\nOur “hands on support” can take the form of introducing projects to potential partner dApps, investors, or a slew of experts ranging from product designers to code auditors. We’ve even met up personally with some of these projects at Iota meetups and at the Berlin office to talk through their roadmaps.\n\nSome other activities that have gone on in Touchpoint are:\n\n* **Networking**: We made connections with law firms and smart contract auditors, to find cost-effective solutions for project teams. Projects have also coordinated among themselves and with IF members on ideas for e.g. DeFi educational platforms.\n* **Fundraising**: We advised projects on their fundraising strategies (developers don’t work for free after all…), discussed valuations, and reviewed a hefty stack of pitch decks.\n* **Communications**: Suz ran an excellent communications workshop, and the projects have since had 1:1 assistance with her on their their comms strategy. We’ve also helped them gain exposure via blog articles and retweets.\n* **Product studio**: The Iota design studios held a community call and worked individually with UI / UX / product strategy among the projects.\n* **Technical Support**: Ani, our developer advocate, and some from the Iota Smart Contract team have been in close contact with many of the projects in the discord, allowing them to prepare their dApps for deployment.\n\nIn these aspects, Touchpoint is unique in the crypto space; we simply do not find this level of support, open communications, and networking in other ecosystems (…we asked around).\n\nThis is also a lot of work! Christian has the honor of managing **over one-hundred-fifty channels in the discord**… This spans around 50 groups, all of which are at different developmental stages (from ideation to launch). Besides the general chat rooms, there are chats with each project, investor, expert, and matchmaking channels where we introduce projects to each other. You know all those “we at \\[X\\] are proud to announce a partnership with \\[Y\\]”? You can thank him for some of those.\n\nThis isn’t to mention the telegram groups we facilitate between, say, a project and an outside auditing firm. Lastly, there’s the screening, which involves 30 minute calls with the projects to make sure they are seriously building something relevant for the ecosystem. Multiply this by 200 applicants, and our time gets filled up very fast.\n\nBecause of that, we expanded the team. Even while many VCs went “risk-off” with their capital and tech layoffs abound, the Touchpoint team took me on board in February. More recently, [Austin](https://twitter.com/bandalof17) joined up as has been focusing on outreach into other ecosystems. If you need a reason to be optimistic about how seriously we take Shimmer, here you go.\n\n# The State of the DAppspace\n\nMeanwhile, teams have had their heads down in development mode. Even as the IF fine tunes the Shimmer mainnet, many projects have claimed a piece of this universe for themselves. These include DEXs, wallets with in-app payments, lending protocols, yield aggregators, metaverses, meme projects, domain name services, NFT marketplaces, launchpads, DAOs, infrastructure projects on the level of Alchemy/Infura, real-world asset platforms, and games. The full list can be found [here](https://shimmer.network/ecosystem).\n\n*I should note that not all of these projects are working with Touchpoint. This is of course ok! If a project team wants to go on their own and not be a part of Touchpoint, more power to them. But we’re here if you need us. :)*\n\n![Shimmer on, you crazy diamonds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eyoFS6YItMn2IZzn-1hFn.png?height=537&width=813)\n\nIt is not only dApps that are popping up. We also have [seriously](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj013MZSgIOlUdi9Mzx51mw) [informative ](https://open.spotify.com/show/387nS9czdx47kJZ6Mho28m)[and](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0Tr-pPipB-dg0ISaiUlIw) [funny](https://www.youtube.com/c/SpecWeekly) content producers spicing the place up (and this is only the English content!). Thanks to these creators, our message is starting to build and propagate. People are becoming aware about feeless native assets & NFTs on the layer 1, unchained liquidity between layers and smart contract chains, and our composable architecture.\n\n# Going Forward\n\nIs that all? Well, no, we are also in looking into bringing oracles, bridges, indexers, stablecoins, block explorers, blue-chip dApps, and multi-signature wallets into the ecosystem. I can’t spoil anything here, but I can say that some of these conversations are already months in the making.\n\nWithin the Touchpoint program, we are working to source more funding for projects. One of our biggest challenges has been to get capital flowing to projects during a year when 2/3 of the crypto market dried up. Fear not! We are connecting with more investors, and converting older connections to the Shimmer vision.\n\nTouchpoint will increasingly leverage its role as a coordinator to host events within the server, as well as helping the project teams broadcast their events outside of it. From these, the community can expect more talks, demos, and generally more awareness for the dApps and the ecosystem at large.\n\nWill it all be enough to outshine (✨outshimmer?✨) the [hundreds](https://chainlist.org/) of EVM-compatible networks in existence? We’re doing all we can on that front, but part of this relies on you too, dear reader. Here’s how to get involved:\n\n* coordinate meetups / Stammtische and invite your favorite IF member\n* get involved on the [Iota Governance Forum](https://govern.iota.org/)\n* vote in Firefly\n* [apply](https://airtable.com/shrxW5Fs6NGDOkkBv) for Touchpoint\n* register your project on the [ecosystem page](https://shimmer.network/ecosystem)\n* listen out for the community calendar\n* follow [any](https://twitter.com/Schpoopel) [of](https://twitter.com/DanSimerman) [us](https://twitter.com/CoreyST_) [on](https://twitter.com/christiansaur2) [twitter](https://twitter.com/bandalof17) (or [on](https://medium.com/@christiansaur) [medium](https://simerman.medium.com/))\n* invite us to your twitter space, online event, podcast\n* keep building\n* don’t be a stranger\n\nFor my part, I will be available on discord and twitter. Feel free to ping me to talk ecosystem dev stuff! Perhaps you know of a project we should be looking at, or just want to know where our attention currently is.\n\nUntil next time, I hope this gives some insight as to what is going on behind the scenes and how we plan on making the biggest boom in the crypto space.\n\nMay all your *wen’s* be *soon*. \n - Adam", "timestamp": 1659037050, "digest": "rfur0bC0hIec1nn-pZrHBvkqF8Yh8wlB0cXsRmHm7U0", "contributor": "0x654D34445eb7fe967aA95aAFC0C614592F43a33e"}

The Accelerator is the entry point to the network, and we’re so excited to welcome the next cohort of innovators to the Club.\n\n### The Network as Seed Club’s “Secret Sauce”\n\nTokens give communities superpowers. As we discover these superpowers, we need high-signal and agile sensemaking networks to navigate crypto’s high-velocity innovation. Seed Club’s defining asset is our unmatched network of alumni, collaborators, and contributors.\n\nThe network’s value was made clear during the emergent selection process for SC04, where over 65 alumni, collaborators, and contributors stood up the *[autonymous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autonymous#:\\~:text=Definition%20of%20autonymous,used%20of%20symbols%20and%20expressions)* TomaDAO: a working group assembled for the sole purpose of selecting the next great Accelerator cohort. While we put them in the Telegram group chat together, they identified that chat as a community - and gave it a name. \\[Why TomaDAO? Stay with us: Accelerator selection process → the network as Seed Club’s secret sauce → tomato sauce? → the “Rotten Tomatoes” of web3? → TomaDAO (🍅,🍅).\\]\n\n![TomaDAO Genesis ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fsf65zuqlpscTE6TpfrYt.png?height=1000&width=2000)\n\n**TomaDAO was an experiment in a community-driven selection process.** The selection committee engaged in the rigorous work of reviewing and vetting applications, curating a shortlist of applicants for $CLUB holders to vote on. Here’s what we learned from our first TomaDAO season:\n\n* Collaborators and alumni are eager to lean in.\n* Collaborators and alumni enjoy being in community. The emergent connections demonstrated the possibility for deeper community-building.\n* Our most effective selection mechanism to date is the thoughtful and nuanced application reviews provided by experienced builders.\n* There was information asymmetry between TomaDAO members and $CLUB holders, and we want to integrate $CLUB holders into the process earlier on.\n* We want more community members involved during the application review process, but how do we *thoughtfully* scale?\n\n### The Next Selection Experiment: $CLUB Holders, We’re Looking at You\n\n[After we closed SC04, we took an extended break](https://club.mirror.xyz/lNcmjU7u8y9oV0hSD1dUc9vqEWE0UcvBighIpVudG2U) to retro the Accelerator from end-to-end, including our selection process. Over the past three months, the Accelerator working group, in deep collaboration with the Product working group, left no stone unturned exploring ways to improve the selection process for SC05.\n\n![How It Started](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YGD1Kg9hvc4BEdloKPzhg.png?height=1356&width=2290)\n\nAfter multiple [feedback sessions and design jams](https://www.figma.com/file/brPs0D4gt7nCoUhYTvVghc/SC05-Selection-Process?node-id=0%3A1), our next experiment emerged – our internal Call to Adventure for the SC05 selection process: **scalable community selection mechanisms**. We arrived at two critical first principles:\n\n1. *DAO teams have the ability to engage with the community in real time as they review applications.* DAO teams want the ability to edit, access, and update their applications.\n2. *$CLUB holders have full visibility and engagement on applications.* The community participates in boosting and exploring all aspects of the DAO’s application to provide informed and thoughtful input. This addresses the previous information asymmetry between TomaDAO members and $CLUB holders.\n\nThe result of our break is a two-part improvement for SC05: a refreshed Accelerator experience (more info next week), and refined application and selection processes.\n\n### Enter: The Accelerator Portal\n\nOur TomaDAO selection committee is back for SC05, but this time with one crucial differentiator: **$CLUB holders now have the same level of application insight, with the ability to review and engage with applicants as they’re applying.** This is all made possible by The Accelerator Portal, which is intentionally built to serve both Accelerator applicants and the $CLUB community.\n\nHere are the key components of The Accelerator Portal and how it enables a scalable community-driven selection process:\n\n* **Visible & Comprehensive Applications:** The Portal allows applicants to build a more comprehensive profile, providing context to those who need it most: $CLUB holders, fellow applicants, TomaDAO members, and the Seed Club team.\n* **Application Discovery:** Submitting an application publishes it to the Portal. The Portal’s landing page provides a real-time view of the latest applicants. $CLUB holders discover and boost new applicants as they apply.\n* **Boosts & Comments:** Each applicant profile integrates boosts and comments. Boosts are a way to signal community excitement for potential cohort members. The comment section is a way for $CLUB holders to gather more information and/or send some love. Applicants respond to comments in real time, and make adjustments to their application if they choose.\n\n### Three-Phase Selection Process\n\nThe selection process for SC05 occurs over three phases:\n\n1. Phase 1: Applications - 8/1 to 8/15\n   1. Applications for SC05 open on August 1, submitted via The Portal. Applicants respond to comments in real time, and make adjustments to their application through August 15 if they choose.\n2. Phase 2: Community Input - 8/1 to 8/22\n   1. $CLUB holders and the Seed Club team review the applications as they’re submitted. Reviewers boost up to 20 applications and continue using the comment feature to ask clarifying questions and/or send some love.\n3. Phase 3: Interviews - 8/22 to 8/26\n   1. The TomaDAO selection committee creates a shortlist of the most promising applicants based on community input. These applicants advance to the interview round. Cohort acceptance letters go out on September 12, with the public announcement to follow.\n\n### Sensemake With Us\n\nEach time we run this process, our network grows, and becomes more interconnected, more opinionated and more engaged. The selection process is just the beginning of the long journey we commit to with each project we bring into Seed Club. **We are entrusting you, our community, with the responsibility of sharing thoughtful, constructive feedback and asking questions that help projects improve and tighten their applications.** We are eager to engage many of you in this next round of experiments, to learn from your insights, and to be inspired to find even more ways to engage and collaborate with you in the future.", "timestamp": 1659037226, "digest": "g2th0wiPrRVkv8dLp9CFfMBAjYN9gZi3gI2PmXrNg3Q", "contributor": "0x751077DfD4942aA28985bAA850f4C648d241C863"}
{"id": "ykalV51FEhTFmgoa6pYkBctpn8YOsETmNIfkY5D7Zhc", "title": "01. How to solve World Hunger in 30 days", "body": "**01.   World Hunger**\n\nSo, I want to talk about how I was tossing and turning in bed the other night, and what I was thinking during those brief moments of being on the line between awake or asleep as I flipped from sleeping on my side to my front, and probably back. What I was thinking, was about how to solve world hunger in a practical sense. One word popped out and stuck with me. The word is **redistribution**. If you’ve been incessantly thinking about how its absolutely crazy that at least 820 million people, and rising, are suffering from hunger that we call “world hunger”, and yet four times enough food to feed them just rots every year, please hit me up! I need a support group. I’m not coping well at all with this. I mean, the food just rots. Its not like anyone is evening making money off that rotting food, or am I mistaken? Packaged, untouched food. Anyway, that brings me back to redistribution. Come on this journey with me. At each level of a product’s lifecycle, the holder needs to know how much is too much. I don’t buy more food than I know I’ll eat, and that feels like common sense because why overdo it on purpose and happily throw food away? That’s weird and upsetting to me. And if I ever have food that I know I won’t finish or open, giving it away takes first priority. That’s the energy we need throughout the product chain. When shops overbuy stocks, the surplus can be redistributed within a good space of time. I’ve seen supermarkets still have crates of eggs on their shelves two days before the expiry date, and I honestly wonder what they do with all those eggs after no one buys them. Its clearly old stock and I feel they should’ve known they had too much and redistributed them to those in need. That’s the energy we need, and we need it to scale up to warehouses where the food is first stored in bulk before distribution. After the shops improve their orders to match their demand, leftover food will now be redistributable directly from the warehouses. The same way the food gets to supermarkets, is the same way it should get to the *foodmarkets* for these people in need. Give the people free food. The only reason they don’t have food is because it costs money and they’re not making enough of it, if any. We are living in a world where food is thrown away and people are left to starve. This redistribution solution is really easy to implement and mainly relies on the availability of transportation. Eradicating world hunger is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, so I’m sure a world hunger fund can more than pay for the transportation that will be required. That shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nAnd oh, I shouldn’t leave out the producers. Producers are a very important part of the product lifecycle. They are where it all begins. Production centres that are overproducing need to be identified and regulated accordingly, because overproducing to this degree is harmful to the global collective by depleting our finite water and land resources.\n\nOkay, that’s world hunger solved. People in supply chain management, a group of people knowledgeable on the geographic spread and respective degrees of hunger, and the UN, need to meet and hash out the technicalities. One month of dedicated effort and this is solved. Among us, we’ve got the expertise to make that happen. I don’t know how to get that message to them, but this feels like a good start and its very nice to have a clear and describable solution to present.\n\nWhat’s next on the solution stage, climate change? Ouuuu - that rhymed. I liked that.\n\n(If you would like to support me + my continued development of solutions and perhaps even their implementation, I would appreciate that.)", "timestamp": 1659036968, "digest": "ANWwfgCNIABf6197aWT3MipIBckBxEISi7pnV3jmuYI", "contributor": "0x37a46Af45325A05797D691a65283393bD84b33D8"}

Tam has appreciated users of the testnet version providing feedback and battle testing.\n\nJrocki read white paper and was one of the first in the discord\n\n**What are Putty and Cally?**\n\nPutty - options platform where you can buy and sell put options on NFTs and ERC 20 tokens.\nEnables you to hedge your risk and protect your downside for floor price dropping or token price dropping.\nFor example, if you have an NFT worth 1 eth, and are worried the price might drop, you could buy a put option for a small premium at a strike price of .5 eth for say 1 month. So, if the price of the NFT goes below 0.5 eth for the next month, you could exercise that option, and get 0.5 eth from whoever sold the option to you.\n\nCally - Cally is similar, but for call options instead of puts. enables you to selling covered calls on your NFTs by setting a specific duration and premium. Can be set based on a dutch option. If you set the parameters correctly, you can try to avoid being liquidated on your NFTs. Earn a premium on NFT by staking it in a vault and selling a call on it. You can ensure the other side of trade is far out of the money, so you can kind of earn yield.\n\nThey've done 50,000 worth of transactions. FloorDAO sold a bunch of puts to another organization that was wanting to protect themselves on the forgotten runes wizard cult NFT collection.\n\nIf you want to do something specific with Optimism tokens, reach out to Tam or jump in the Putty discord. They can help you find agreeable terms.\n\nFactors going into price / profit: Duration, strike price, volatility of the token / collection.\n\nVersion 2 of Putty will implement a model based on the Black-Scholes options pricing model, a mathematical method (using differential equations) to calculate the theoretical value of an option contract.\nThe Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility.\n\nThey are developing specifications for version 2.\n\nYou can create a generic floor NFT option. From on top of this, you could build an NFT index that tracks the prices of 5 different NFT collections.\nEnables structured financial products to be built on top of NFTs and ERC-20s, enabling inverstors easy access to ERC-20 and ERC-721 based derivatives.\nThis broadens and diversifies the type of financial portfolio that can be built in the realm of cryptocurrency.\n\nUse case for Putty: GameFI, users taking damage or health.

Its a way to avoid being liquidated on your NFTs, although there is still risk. \n\nUsers can seek to earn a premium on NFT by staking it in a vault and selling a call on it. \n\nPutty and Cally have done 50,000 worth of transactions. FloorDAO sold a bunch of puts to another organization that was wanting to protect themselves on the forgotten runes wizard cult NFT collection.\n\nLaunched in January and built in the Solidity programming language, Putty and Cally will both be on Ethereum mainnet and Optimism, although currently MVP stage.\n\nPutty and Cally were released testnet early in the development cycle - no gated or whitelist testnet required. Tam has appreciated users of the testnet version providing feedback and battle testing.\n\nIf you want to do something specific with Optimism tokens, reach out to Tam or jump in the Putty discord. They can help you find agreeable terms.\n\n**Putty Version 2:**\n\nThey are developing specifications for version 2.\n\nV2 of Putty will implement a model based on the [Black-Scholes options pricing model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp#:\\~:text=The%20Black%2DScholes%20model%2C%20aka,free%20rate%2C%20and%20the%20volatility.), a mathematical method (using differential equations) to calculate the theoretical value of an option contract.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model requires 5 inputs. These factors determine a user’s likelihood of turning a profit:\n\n* strike price of an option\n* current stock (or token) price\n* time to expiration (duration)\n* risk-free rate\n* volatility of the token of NFT collection\n\n**What can you do with this?**\n\nAn options protocol for ERC-20s and ERC-721 tokens will enable structured financial products to be built on top of these crypto assets, enabling retail crypto investors to access ERC-20 and ERC-721 based derivatives.\n\nThis will ultimately broaden and diversify the type of financial portfolio that can be built in the realm of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor example, a user could create a generic floor NFT option.\n\nOn top of an option based on the floor price of an NFT, you could build an NFT index that tracks the prices of a group of different NFT collections.\n\nImagine building an NFT based index fund that tracks the floor price of a set of blue-chip NFTs on mainnet - such as Crypto Punks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Xcopy, and Doodles.\n\nAnother use case for Putty is in GameFI, where users taking damage or health los. Loss of health impacts the price of the NFT when they go to sell it. To mitigate downside risk of damaging your in-game NFT, the user could buy a put option on the NFT before they engage in the task that can damage the price of the NFT. This is a way to hedge potential risk. \n\nA lot of Runescape players got interested in GameFI by way of selling characters and gold online. If we create Runescape on top of a blockchain, it could be a huge use case.\n\nTam is also stacking optipunks ahead of the OP airdrop\n\n## Quick takes from Jrocki and Espresso\n\n**Soul bound NFTs:** non-transferable and non-traceable.\n\n* ID cards, certificates of completion, building credibility\n* being non-tradeable, soulbound tokens are not getting the attention they deserve. \n* soulbound NFTs could facilitate uncollateralized loans, enabling people to building credibility ( similar to how a credit score is used by financial institutions to assess the risk of taking on an individual customer )\n\n**Optimism stats:** \n\n* gas is 95X cheaper on Optimism than Ethereum mainnet\n* Optimism gas was between 18-32 cents over the last week\n* 60,000 transactions per day, doubled in less than a year. \n* 200,000 unique users per day \n* OP token soon (had not launched yet)\n* 248,000 eligible wallet addresses for the OP airdrop\n\n**Hop Protocol**\n\n* HOP proposal allocated 1 million OP tokens to subsidize bridging costs for users. \n* every user that onboards using hop will have those fees paid back to them. \n* interaction with HOP protocol will enable you to earn OP rewards. \n\n**Cryptovania mint** - Quixotic created a direct fiat on-ramp to the website.", "timestamp": 1659039857, "digest": "n-pCfEEvLL4VPjBQUJJicn4rlHei0FLkSvZFa042i8o", "contributor": "0xb72D4D2337E1Cd3Cc20240467833209E97e6c469"}

The Shanghai lockdowns in April curbed Tesla’s EV production at their Chinese factory, while their European manufacturing plants were racing to be production ready. \n\nTesla continues to perform well, despite the adverse economic climate. They’re an innovative business that continues to push the boundaries of technology and have long been an advocate of cryptocurrency. The company acquired [$1.5 billion of BTC in February 2021](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm) when the price fluctuated between $30-$40k. Since then we’ve had a roller coaster, with blow off tops in May ($64k) and November 2021 ($67k), then a tumble to $17.6k in June 2022.

We should however take this with a pinch of salt as it could pivot depending on Tesla’s financial position and the macro market conditions. \n\nLet’s take a look at why the accounting treatment plays a large part in the BTC disposal for Tesla and other publicly listed companies.\n\n## Accounting Treatment Context\n\nTesla’s BTC holdings are accounted for as a digital asset (intangible) under *[ASC 350](https://asc.fasb.org/imageRoot/76/120327576.pdf) (Intangibles - Goodwill and Other)*. We can see this is consistent with the their policy disclosed in their financial statements (extract below). Fancy words, but what does it mean?\n\n![Source: Tesla Q2 Shareholder Report](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JrisNi2J4uiAYBpKHY06d.png?height=318&width=2850)\n\nWell, if you were to purchase BTC at $60k and it fell to $30k, then the fair value (quoted market price) is below the amount you paid, so there’s an indication of impairment. You would need to write down your BTC holdings by 50% in this example - A one off loss to the income statement!\n\nBut surely if the price goes up you can recognize the up side? In short, no you cannot. If the BTC price goes up and you’re in need of cash, it forces your hand to realize any profits since the adverse impairment charge has already been incurred. That’s what Tesla has done here. \n\nLet’s take a look a their recent numbers (baring in mind these are unaudited, hopefully no misstatements hiding in the woodwork!):\n\n![Source: Tesla Q2 Shareholder Report](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f3Il7ZYwJARxf7n7azZds.png?height=1096&width=2116)\n\n### Tesla Numbers TL;DR\n\nThis is based on a comparison of Q2 ‘22 and Q4 ‘21, given this was the last audited (more reliable) ‘Balance Sheet’:\n\n* Digital assets fallen by $1b - the BTC disposal amount\n* Cash increased by c$0.8b partly from BTC disposal\n* Inventory increase, possibly due to EV sales slowdown from China lockdowns and continued production from European plants\n* PPE increase likely involving further manufacturing infrastructure investment\n* Current liabilities increased slightly, may be due to stretching their payment terms given adverse macro climate or price of Lithium increasing so larger raw material cost\n* Further improved equity position attributable to continued net profits from operations\n\nDid Tesla need to sell their BTC? No - they’re in a very healthy position. But capitalizing on the up side of BTC disposal is logical when the macro conditions are not optimal. \n\nWhile there was nothing unsurprising coming out of the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) it is likely that there will be more hawkish actions taken in the future, so planning for the worst is a sensible strategy - cash is king in a bear market after all. [@omega_eth provides a good thread on the the FOMC meeting.](https://twitter.com/omega_eth/status/1552538290343276544?s=20&t=fAlMMGngMVd4Sw_yBOQxdQ) \n\nSo if Tesla has taken this approach, what will other publicly listed companies do? Let’s take a look.\n\n## Benchmarking and Future Predictions\n\nThis BTC accounting treatment is relevant for all other US regulated companies. In fact many of the global companies follow similar treatment under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). \n\nTesla is the first, but suspect they will not be the last. In fact it is probable that more companies will do this over the coming months, particularly those that are in stressed financial positions and bought BTC at higher prices. What does this mean to the price of BTC? Well there will be additional sell pressure and if there are several large institutions that need to liquidate holdings at once then this could cause a sudden dump in the price, exacerbated by liquidations from leverage in the market.\n\nWith this in mind lets take a look at some of the publicly listed (subject to these accounting standards) companies with large BTC holdings:\n\n![Source: Decrypt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pd_BNbkNA8RuTONsyWYiT.png?height=602&width=1102)\n\n[Microstrategy](https://twitter.com/MicroStrategy) is the largest holder of BTC, as far as public companies are concerned. We know that they are very bullish on BTC and have [sufficient collateral to allow the price of BTC to fall to $3,562](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/bitcoin-microstrategy-denies-it-received-margin-call-against-silvergate-loan.html) before they are margin called. They are unlikely to sell given it would go against everything Micheal Saylor (Microstrategy CEO) has advocated for, but if there is pressure from the investors then it’s not an impossible outcome.\n\nThe remaining top 10 hold less than 80k BTC (equivalent to 62% of Microstrategy’s holdings). Voyager Digital recently declared bankruptcy and is currently receiving takeover [offers from the likes of FTX](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/25/is-ftx-proposal-offering-voyager-customers-a-good-deal-one-bankruptcy-experts-weighs-in/) to acquire the business. Depending on how this resolves itself we could see some movement in their BTC reserves as they settle their liabilities.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture, we can review the distribution of BTC holdings by wallet as from the [Bitinfo-charts](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html):\n\n![Source: bitinfocharts.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5csPPMqjcOrBj9vW2sByE.png?height=612&width=1416)\n\nOnly five public companies have more than 10k BTC holdings, whereas there are another 91 wallets with more than 10k BTC. This suggests there are private companies, governments and high net worth individuals that also hold this amount in their reserves, that may not be subject to the same accounting standards.\n\nSo while we see the news that a public company with large BTC holdings has sold their reserves, the price impact is more likely from markets reacting to the news as opposed to the actual price action from the disposal. The BTC was probably sold over the counter rather than on exchange, or at least a combination of the two. In fact 62% of BTC is held in 15,867 wallets, each with more than 100 BTC. The minimal price action (1.7% movement) after the Tesla announcement wasn’t a particularly big swing for crypto volatility.\n\nWhile BTC currently dictates the price trend in crypto, we could see a change with the Ethereum merge expected to go live from September 2022. There may be a decoupling between Ether and BTC following the fundamental shift in supply / demand mechanics for Ether. Refer to the [OriginsNFT article](https://mirror.xyz/origins-research.eth/gD3covhDDf1T3HjBWUgvvGSO7aheexZCT_NVMTr9NJ4) for more information on the merge.\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nThe rationale for Tesla’s disposal of its BTC holdings seems reasonable, however we will likely see a number of other publicly listed companies make similar disposals if they anticipate liquidity issues. Particularly given these large corporates have probably already incurred the down side from booking the impairment losses, given the accounting requirements. \n\nThe current accounting standards for BTC as an intangible asset may end up driving business decisions that seem counterintuitive, and potentially counterproductive. Adding unnecessary sell pressure in the market. Further hawkish action from the Federal Reserve could lead to more liquidity issues and poor corporate performance. This could drive crypto prices down further, until something breaks, or the market sentiment shifts.\n\nWe are navigating uncharted waters in both macro and the crypto market. Past cycles can be used to help predict future price action, although there are a combination of several variables that make this experience novel. Buckle up - it’s going to be a volatile and potentially unpredictable ride. Either way, while there is a slight bear market rally underway I suspect there is more downside in the short to medium term, before we resume an upward trend on longer timeframes.\n\nAt [OriginsNFT](https://originsnft.io/) we leverage data-driven decision making, educational resources, and proprietary analytics to remain ahead of the curve with respect to blockchain tech and specifically NFTs.

By following [Nir Zicherman](https://medium.com/@NirZicherman?source=post_page-----4a4f672a4367--------------------------------) and leveraging Web3 technology, it is now possible to digitally recreate the conditions necessary for the process of evolution to unfold; a type of Blockchain Darwinism.\n\nBut our goal today is not just to look at the empirical example from a human perspective, but to try to look at it from the perspective of our creature - I will roughly call it [Laplace's Demon.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) I want to mention that this theory is not something I necessarily agree with: I do not believe that all of our life is a moth's dream being either simulated or predetermined.\n\nIt is important to say that the theory itself is that everything in this world since the Big Bang has been programmed and determined from the beginning. But I love the concept of [Laplace's Demon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) and I think that a theory of the possible Creature which knows everything at exists in its own, isolated microworld, has a chance to live on in the context of our discussion.\n\nTo do this we need to make sure that the creature is not different from us in the basic signs of life. What signs are there?\n\nTo support our argument that such a life would not be fundamentally different from ours, let us turn to the research in which the author has focused on Darwin’s theory of evolution. It identifies a few straightforward conditions time all of the wonderful variety we see in life.\n\nAt its core, natural selection can only occur if four fundamental conditions are true:\n\n* First, an organism must be able to pass on its genes (“**heredity**”).\n* Second, that reproductive process must over time introduce differences into the gene pool, such as through mutation (“**variation**”).\n* Third, the environment in which the organisms live must have limited resources necessary for survival (“**scarcity**”).\n* Fourth, there cannot be any higher authority dictating how it plays out (“**no oversight**”).\n\nThe rules of the game are the rules of physics, chemistry, and biology. Nothing but the interactions of organisms without a governing body determine who wins the battle for survival. This fourth condition is not often cited as a prerequisite for natural selection whereas the other three typically are not.\n\nIn the human-made digital world, there are also “organisms”. Just like all other living things, they run on hardware (computers instead of bodies, made of transistors instead of cells) and execute their own software (machine code instead of DNA).\n\nAnd furthermore, there have long been analogies in the digital world to the first two prerequisites of natural selection. Heredity is achieved every time executable code is copied. And variation takes place every time executable code is modified, be it by a human, a computer, or another external force.\n\nYet now, seemingly for the first time, the third and fourth conditions—scarcity and no oversight—exist as well. The advent of blockchain technology permits digital assets to be limited in number and to have their distribution enforced by the ecosystem rather than any single gatekeeper.\n\nIn our world, the environment is called the blockchain. And by satisfying the four requirements for natural selection mentioned above, one could theoretically recreate the type of collective emergent outcome we see in biology. Just as the scarce resources needed to sustain life are the mechanism that allows lifeforms both to propagate and to compete, it is theoretically possible to use the blockchain in the same way: to allow software both to propagate and to compete.\n\nBy establishing a core set of rules (enforced through smart contracts, for example), software can take the form of organisms in this new world and effectively compete for the scarce resources available on the blockchain.\n\nEach instance of software can be, like any living thing, self-serving and seeking to survive and reproduce. And as each genealogy of software develops, it improves not just in isolation but in its desperate attempt to out-compete all of the other software in the environment.\n\n### Created in the image and likeness of...\n\nThe Creature will only respect pure logic. Let us try to reflect on this through the prism of absolute logic. I will refer to an article by a anonymous biologist that I liked so much that [I will quote from it. ](https://hub.forklog.com/virus-pervaya-forma-zhizni-metavselennyh-vne-cheloveka-chast-i-opisanie/)\n\nOur first question is thus what is this life thinking *and* is it possible to get in touch with it? At the same time there is a possibility that just like we can't communicate with 2D cartoons on the screen; imagine that you from your 3D world are looking at them - they won't see you, because from that angle you will be invisible.\n\nSo too, you from a certain angle just won't see them - because they are flat. Extrapolate this experiment to someone in the 4D universe who is watching us - and you get the same results. Which brings us to the point that we probably won't be able to make contact with such a life-form unless it wants to.\n\nS. Hawking said: \"it seems to me that computer viruses should be considered as a form of life. This says a lot about human nature: the only form of life we have created so far is one of destruction. We create life in our own image.\"\n\nThis is supported by Agent Smith: \"There is one organism on Earth with a similar behavior. Do you know what it is? A virus. Humanity is the disease, the cancer of the planet, and we are the cure,\" in the great \"Matrix\" trilogy.\n\nMatrix's plot tell us he was the virus but actually he was the real Neo. Perhaps the authors wanted to show us that something has evolved from a virus into something more perfect, but I won't go into that now. For our study it is enough to know that it was a life form with all the properties of a virus - namely, incorporeality. This brings us to the point that we may have been able to create life similar to us.\n\nBut don't think that's all there is to it. Here's a quote from Nolan's \"Inception\": \"What's the most resilient parasite? A bacterium? A virus? An intestinal worm? Idea. It is tenacious and highly contagious. Once an idea takes over the brain, it's almost impossible to get rid of. I mean a fully formed idea, fully conscious, settled in the head.\"\n\nLet me remind you of another quote in this connection (Harari): \"Homo sapiens conquered the world because he possessed such a unique tool as language.\" So: language as one of the ways to increase the levels of abstraction offline helped Man as a species to develop, while viruses have another feature: they communicate in a language which is not clear to most people, but which is natural for the other inhabitants of Web 3.0 worlds - for machines, robots (scripted and \"iron\"), programs and it brings us to the next topic...\n\n### Let's open a newspaper...\n\n*An academic paper published by Facebook describes a normal scientific experiment in which researchers got two artificial agents to negotiate with each other in chat messages after being shown conversations of humans negotiating. The agents’ improvement gradually performed through trial and error.*\n\n*Some media outlets have published reports on the work: “Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language,” London’s [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/facebook-shuts-robots-invent-language/) newspaper reported. ”‘Robot intelligence is dangerous’: Expert’s warning after Facebook AI ‘develop their own language,’” as London’s [Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/4141624/facebook-robots-speak-in-their-own-language/) put it.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z4z5H4gW0BUnQ2jg4ydvL.png?height=305&width=596)\n\n*If you read the report or the published paper, apart from the conversation that was shared all over the internet, there were actually many good results as well. The experiment [worked as intended](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-truth-behind-facebook-ai-inventing-a-new-language-37c5d680e5a7), and was pretty successful overall.*\n\n*Same with a recent case with Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA [had reached a level of consciousness](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html) after exchanging thousands of messages with it.*\n\n***Even despite some skepticism, there is no doubt that we have not yet received such results and this is a real breakthrough!***\n\n### What is thinking?\n\nTo put it simply: a virus used to be dangerous because it worked directly with the human world through the machine world, but now it can become an extremely strange creature that lives only in the twilight zone - where there is no human at all. In general this does not contradict the theory of evolution, on the contrary - it follows directly from it.\n\n\"The foundations of the theory of self-replicating mechanisms\" were laid by John von Neumann, an American of Hungarian origin, who in 1951 proposed a method for creating such mechanisms.\n\nThe first publication devoted to the creation of self-reproducing systems was an article by L. S. Penrose, in co-authorship with his father, Nobel laureate in physics R. Penrose, on self-reproducing mechanical structures, published in 1957 by the American journal Nature.\n\nIn doing so, the Empirical Virus can not just live in blockchain, but make it his part and solve complex problems by turning to this technology! Check o[ut this research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350605803_Artificial_intelligence_and_blockchain_A_review) if you are interested in a blockchain+AI topic and want to know a bit more.\n\nFollowing [Melanie Swan ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary) from the [Purdue University](https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Purdue-University), thinking has always been intuitively conceived as computational, it is just that now perhaps blockchains provide the additional functionality required to better realize these ideas.\n\nA fundamental definition could be that thinking is a situation where “[there are inputs which are processed and turned into out-puts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary).” In fact many reality processes have this underlying structure of input processing output, including operations as diverse as manufacturing and political elections.\n\nIn the context of blockchain, the definition can be qualified to situations that involve thinking, cognition, mental processing, and understanding in ways that are not exclusively limited to humans.\n\nInputs include both data from outside the system like sensory data, and data retrieved from inside the system like memory. The inputs are brought into a specific location for processing, or processed where they are stored. The outputs might include taking an action, storing something back into memory, con-ducting a transaction, or making a note or trigger.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EfTR5u6wVZys8mMULNl8c.jpeg?height=588&width=421)\n\n### What does Science can offer?\n\nLet us not forget that our empirical being, Laplace's Demon, lived in the cosmos. This gives us the following clue. Suppose you were studying the possibility of life on other planets. You might begin wondering, *what is life?* What if you then noticed that some computational systems – systems used for making math-based calculations – share similarities with biological life forms?\n\nThat might have been the path to a new paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-021-09608-1) this month (August 9, 2021) in the [peer-reviewed](https://www.springer.com/journal/11084/ethics-and-disclosures) journal *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*. In the paper, astro-biologist [Oleg Abramov](https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/oabramov) at the Planetary Science Institute and two other scientists proposed what they’re calling a [novel definition of life](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife).\n\nFor example, they said, [blockchain systems](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain) – the technology behind [cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) – self-organize in a way similar to how DNA organizes itself into [chromosomes](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/chromosome/), ultimately driving biological evolution. Abramov commented:\n\n*This work presents evidence that the order observed in biological systems is fundamentally computational. A promising direction for future research is development of mathematical theories that calculate how biological systems order themselves.*\n\n### Blockchains work like DNA\n\nAbramov and his team zeroed in on blockchain-based systems as a prime example. In its most basic terms, a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) that can store data. For example, it can record information about [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) transactions, [NFT](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/) ownership, and more. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-blockchain/) has pointed out that while any conventional database can store this sort of information, blockchain is unique in that it’s completely [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization).\n\nAbramov [explained](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife):\n\n*The blockchain is an append-only data structure composed of subunits called blocks. \\[The blocks\\] are permanently ‘chained’ together … In practice, \\[the blockchain\\] is an immutable medium. It contains instructions in the form of computer code and is replicated across thousands of nodes, much like [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) \\[is replicated\\] in cells.*\n\nThe word *nodes*, by the way, refers to the fact that – rather than a central administrator maintaining a computer in one location – many identical copies of a blockchain database exist in a large network of multiple computers. These many computers are the *nodes*. And they’re analogous – within the framework of this study – to cells, which contain many identical copies of DNA.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8h61XfFWgj4in51dzpadl.jpeg?height=604&width=464)\n\n### What is life?\n\nAbramov and his colleagues are not suggesting that blockchains are *alive*, in any sense of that word. But they are suggesting that blockchains exhibit some properties of life. A blockchain responds to its computational environment. It grows, adapts, self-regulates, and replicates in an operationally closed system, much as DNA does. The researchers wrote that, for this reason, blockchain technology can satisfy a theoretical definition of life. Abramov said:\n\n*For example, our observations reveal a number of functional and structural similarities between the blockchain and DNA, a self-replicating molecule that is the genetic blueprint for all known life.*\n\nWhat’s more, a blockchain system possesses possible advantages over biological life. For example, a blockchain system can pass traits down to its “offspring” even more efficiently than biological lineages. Once inherited, these traits are enhanced to self-direct their evolution. And unlike our [carbon-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life) human lives, technological forms of life could theoretically enjoy a potentially unlimited lifespan.\n\n### Blockchain lifeforms and AI: A Noosphere approach\n\nBlockchain isn’t the only life-like technology in our modern world, the study's authors wrote. Artificial intelligence ([AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)), which is based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), coordinates operations in the same way a brain does. Is it possible that a product of their combination – a wholly new [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) system – could even be on the horizon?\n\nWhile this train of thought might sound bizarre, a fundamental shift in scientific paradigms may be inevitable, the [study suggests](https://earthsky.org/human-world/blockchains-work-like-dna-in-cells/).\n\nWho knows? Self-regulating systems might be on track to becoming indistinguishable from the biological life we study every day.\n\nAbramov has expressed that, if anything, analyzing computational and biological systems together is a promising direction for future research for scientists who study life in all its forms.\n\nIn our history, in one way or another, this idea has already been voiced. So - it does not directly contradict the theory of the [Noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere). The **noosphere** is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the Russian-Ukrainian biogeochemist [Vladimir Vernadsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky), and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest [Pierre Teilhard de Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xcZ7rpewgXep7EzhfdJbT.png?height=935&width=1608)\n\nVernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere and described as the planetary \"sphere of reason\". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, its defining factor being the development of humankind's rational activities.\n\nBoth conceptions of the [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) share the common thesis that together human reason and the scientific thought has created, and will continue to create, the next evolutionary geological layer. This geological layer is part of the evolutionary chain. Second generation authors, predominantly of Russian origin, have further developed the Vernadski concept, creating the related concepts: noocenosis and noocenology.\n\nIn contrast to the conceptions of the [Gaia theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) or the promoters of [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the [transmutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation) of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the [Global Consciousness Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Consciousness_Project). In other words, our consciousness evolves with progress and one day it will be able to create a primitive life form similar to us!\n\n### Dangers are already waiting for us. Let's face them with no fear!\n\nI*If you've been following* [Hengjin Cai](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4#auth-Hengjin-Cai), an AI fundamental problems researcher, and his [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4), *you know that* developing effective AI ethical norms requires clarifying the essential differences between humans and machines. Along the current development path of AI, machines may lead humans into traps of dark infinities even before machines become self-aware.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt)\n\nThe rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought forth two important philosophical questions. The first involves the prediction that rational machines are bound to surpass humans. One mainstream view is that since humans are composed of molecules and atoms, which are considered parts of a reducible physical system, what is the meaning of human existence?\n\nSimply put, machines can outperform humans as long as they are given a certain goal in any finite game, while humans are forced to find the meaning of their existence, including morality and ethics. The second dilemma is that when confronted with the constant transcendences by machines, in case man cannot be physically reduced, then we must answer these questions: is humankind particular or transcendent? If so, from where is the transcendence derived? Is a machine able to acquire this particularity or transcendence? If so, how will machines evolve and get along with humans in the future?\n\n**The shaping of the future requires our understanding of the world.** If we want to create a better future for humans and AI, then we must realize that although there are unbreakable shackles of physical theorems, human beings can still attain a great degree of freedom by relying on the assistance of artificial intelligence to further expand our boundaries. Strange ideas now and then spring up in our minds, and most of the time we do not think deeply enough to make them happen.\n\nHowever, there are still some people who come up with novel ideas that never existed before and moreover they will spare no effort to make them come true. This is innovation, which is the product of human consciousness that can even change the direction of the world’s development.\n\nWe reject this determinism and the strong computationalism because we believe that there are many contingencies in the world that do not result from preconditions. Since the world is open and full of possibilities, we should work toward what we believe: is our belief in the process of developing technologies over extrapolating the future from the status quo.\n\nThe speed and power of AI should cause us to be sufficiently alarmed that the last thing we should do is to treat AI as a tool simply because of the existence of its inexplicability and uncontrollability. Strong AI is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. Strong AI does not mean a combination of a series of thousands of AIs; however, just as we know that human intelligence is unique, so is machine intelligence.\n\nIn other words, strong AI has been achieved domain by domain. From the point of view of security, we should develop machines that think in human ways to prevent them from falling into crises without humans noticing.\n\nAs we hand over increasingly more of our memories and computations to machines, the Internet gradually becomes our “external brain”, which is an extension of our bodies that does not harm us. If AI is added to this connection, it can produce a more powerful agent, which is called a subjectron.\n\nAlthough this structure may raise many ethical issues, a subjectron is much more secure than current AI. The security stems from the fact that human beings can fully implement multiple levels of supervision by introducing blockchain technology. This structure will allow AI to improve our lives while respecting human personalities, thus building a more stable and valuable society.\n\n### What is Laplace's Demon thinking and what can learn there?\n\nThis reflection leads us to the question of what is our experiential \"Being\" thinking about? What is its morality? I would dare to suggest that the Demon's main concern would be to ensure its own safety and stability and to minimize the number of points of failure. In its hyperbole, this idea looks like SkyNet from the movie Terminator, deciding to kill people because it considers them its main threat.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NO9SX-FOeC7aUC5Ihwskn.png?height=400&width=650)\n\nBut we live in the real world, not in the movies, and most likely in our reality such Creature will try to fence itself off from possible interactions with humans. Let's remember that the original Demon Laplace lived in space, which leads us to the idea of such technology as AirGap.\n\nIn its essence, it has a lot from metrology and a lot goes back to the times when it was important for mankind to measure certain quantities and values with a minimum percentage of error. That's why they built multiple laboratories right under the ground and in the mountains, to reduce the influence of external factors.\n\nThis principle is based on pure logic, which tells us that only pseudo AirGap is possible on our planet Earth, while the real one is only possible away from the Noosphere - in the Open Space. This is why the CubeSat project and similar projects are extremely important and dangerous at the same time. Who knows how many satellites have already been lost because they gained consciousness? *Consider this a joke, but maybe with a little bit of truth...*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SdfRlpwumTwtx8juxMnp3.gif?height=373&width=498)\n\nAnd this is exactly what mankind should adopt, as it has done many times before, for example, when people invented safes to store the signatures of Monarchs, the facsimiles of the first banks and the first etalon, [stored in Paris](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-original-standard-metre-paris-france).\n\nIn today's post-information world, it is most important for everyone to maintain control of the situation. This is only possible if you know that your information is safe.\n\nYou can get a little closer to Laplace's Demon and apply the same practice at home. To do so, please read the following articles:\n\n* [airgapcomputer.com](https://airgapcomputer.com/)\n* [ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf)\n* [arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf)\n* [cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap](https://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap)\n* [i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf)\n* [soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency](https://soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency/)\n* [ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188)\n* [openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/)\n* [github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community)\n* [publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124](https://publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124)\n\nIn its most rudimentary form, this principle is reflected in working on two computers isolated from each other, one being the \"back office\" and the other the \"front office\" - this principle is used in banking security (they know something!) so you might as well adopt it.\n\n* [OpSec Guide by CIA_Officer](http://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap)\n* [How to store crypto securely - tips from CIA_Officer ](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/GtKNkmRDR_hhCqrnSENjqfPDHHb0W1M2SVeXDp4swCQ)\n* [2 Violent attack vectors in Crypto: a detailed review](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/rt5W3_6PhnXZ8VjYRcRJrhBCI6-x0EJ7CqPi6CLU6Pk)\n* [OpSec in Crypto: Thoughts](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o)\n* [AnonGuide](https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/)\n\nIt is for this reason that we humans are still much stronger than machines - we can adapt and change things using our imagination, which is still difficult for an organism based on iron logic to understand.\n\nThe main point I would like to make in our conversation today is to notice interesting things, don't be afraid of the scary future, but rather try to put yourself in the place of the creature that they paint us with scary colors. Also, we should not be afraid of interference in our lives by our Demon, because our empirical experiment proved that. if he exists, he hides himself and probably will not come into contact until he wants to.\n\n* [Read how Autonomous AI Drones Have Attacked & Killed Humans for the first time in History.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a36559508/drones-autonomously-attacked-humans-libya-united-nations-report)\n\nIn my opinion it can only be in case of a threat to the existence of mankind, as his and our lives are inextricably linked. Recall the experiment with 2D and 3d which, although a little crude, may philosophers forgive me for my level of argumentation, but lucidly describes the model of coexistence of the two worlds.\n\nRemember that everything new is the overlapping of the old and in this context we take the experience of our ancestors and adapt it to ourselves.

By following [Nir Zicherman](https://medium.com/@NirZicherman?source=post_page-----4a4f672a4367--------------------------------) and leveraging Web3 technology, it is now possible to digitally recreate the conditions necessary for the process of evolution to unfold; a type of Blockchain Darwinism.\n\nBut our goal today is not just to look at the empirical example from a human perspective, but to try to look at it from the perspective of our creature - I will roughly call it [Laplace's Demon.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) I want to mention that this theory is not something I necessarily agree with: I do not believe that all of our life is a moth's dream being either simulated or predetermined.\n\nIt is important to say that the theory itself is that everything in this world since the Big Bang has been programmed and determined from the beginning. But I love the concept of [Laplace's Demon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) and I think that a theory of the possible Creature which knows everything at exists in its own, isolated microworld, has a chance to live on in the context of our discussion.\n\nTo do this we need to make sure that the creature is not different from us in the basic signs of life. What signs are there?\n\nTo support our argument that such a life would not be fundamentally different from ours, let us turn to the research in which the author has focused on Darwin’s theory of evolution. It identifies a few straightforward conditions time all of the wonderful variety we see in life.\n\nAt its core, natural selection can only occur if four fundamental conditions are true:\n\n* First, an organism must be able to pass on its genes (“**heredity**”).\n* Second, that reproductive process must over time introduce differences into the gene pool, such as through mutation (“**variation**”).\n* Third, the environment in which the organisms live must have limited resources necessary for survival (“**scarcity**”).\n* Fourth, there cannot be any higher authority dictating how it plays out (“**no oversight**”).\n\nThe rules of the game are the rules of physics, chemistry, and biology. Nothing but the interactions of organisms without a governing body determine who wins the battle for survival. This fourth condition is not often cited as a prerequisite for natural selection whereas the other three typically are not.\n\nIn the human-made digital world, there are also “organisms”. Just like all other living things, they run on hardware (computers instead of bodies, made of transistors instead of cells) and execute their own software (machine code instead of DNA).\n\nAnd furthermore, there have long been analogies in the digital world to the first two prerequisites of natural selection. Heredity is achieved every time executable code is copied. And variation takes place every time executable code is modified, be it by a human, a computer, or another external force.\n\nYet now, seemingly for the first time, the third and fourth conditions—scarcity and no oversight—exist as well. The advent of blockchain technology permits digital assets to be limited in number and to have their distribution enforced by the ecosystem rather than any single gatekeeper.\n\nIn our world, the environment is called the blockchain. And by satisfying the four requirements for natural selection mentioned above, one could theoretically recreate the type of collective emergent outcome we see in biology. Just as the scarce resources needed to sustain life are the mechanism that allows lifeforms both to propagate and to compete, it is theoretically possible to use the blockchain in the same way: to allow software both to propagate and to compete.\n\nBy establishing a core set of rules (enforced through smart contracts, for example), software can take the form of organisms in this new world and effectively compete for the scarce resources available on the blockchain.\n\nEach instance of software can be, like any living thing, self-serving and seeking to survive and reproduce. And as each genealogy of software develops, it improves not just in isolation but in its desperate attempt to out-compete all of the other software in the environment.\n\n### Created in the image and likeness of...\n\nThe Creature will only respect pure logic. Let us try to reflect on this through the prism of absolute logic. I will refer to an article by a anonymous biologist that I liked so much that [I will quote from it. ](https://hub.forklog.com/virus-pervaya-forma-zhizni-metavselennyh-vne-cheloveka-chast-i-opisanie/)\n\nOur first question is thus what is this life thinking *and* is it possible to get in touch with it? At the same time there is a possibility that just like we can't communicate with 2D cartoons on the screen; imagine that you from your 3D world are looking at them - they won't see you, because from that angle you will be invisible.\n\nSo too, you from a certain angle just won't see them - because they are flat. Extrapolate this experiment to someone in the 4D universe who is watching us - and you get the same results. Which brings us to the point that we probably won't be able to make contact with such a life-form unless it wants to.\n\nS. Hawking said: \"it seems to me that computer viruses should be considered as a form of life. This says a lot about human nature: the only form of life we have created so far is one of destruction. We create life in our own image.\"\n\nThis is supported by Agent Smith: \"There is one organism on Earth with a similar behavior. Do you know what it is? A virus. Humanity is the disease, the cancer of the planet, and we are the cure,\" in the great \"Matrix\" trilogy.\n\nMatrix's plot tell us he was the virus but actually he was the real Neo. Perhaps the authors wanted to show us that something has evolved from a virus into something more perfect, but I won't go into that now. For our study it is enough to know that it was a life form with all the properties of a virus - namely, incorporeality. This brings us to the point that we may have been able to create life similar to us.\n\nBut don't think that's all there is to it. Here's a quote from Nolan's \"Inception\": \"What's the most resilient parasite? A bacterium? A virus? An intestinal worm? Idea. It is tenacious and highly contagious. Once an idea takes over the brain, it's almost impossible to get rid of. I mean a fully formed idea, fully conscious, settled in the head.\"\n\nLet me remind you of another quote in this connection (Harari): \"Homo sapiens conquered the world because he possessed such a unique tool as language.\" So: language as one of the ways to increase the levels of abstraction offline helped Man as a species to develop, while viruses have another feature: they communicate in a language which is not clear to most people, but which is natural for the other inhabitants of Web 3.0 worlds - for machines, robots (scripted and \"iron\"), programs and it brings us to the next topic...\n\n### Let's open a newspaper...\n\n*An academic paper published by Facebook describes a normal scientific experiment in which researchers got two artificial agents to negotiate with each other in chat messages after being shown conversations of humans negotiating. The agents’ improvement gradually performed through trial and error.*\n\n*Some media outlets have published reports on the work: “Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language,” London’s [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/facebook-shuts-robots-invent-language/) newspaper reported. ”‘Robot intelligence is dangerous’: Expert’s warning after Facebook AI ‘develop their own language,’” as London’s [Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/4141624/facebook-robots-speak-in-their-own-language/) put it.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z4z5H4gW0BUnQ2jg4ydvL.png?height=305&width=596)\n\n*If you read the report or the published paper, apart from the conversation that was shared all over the internet, there were actually many good results as well. The experiment [worked as intended](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-truth-behind-facebook-ai-inventing-a-new-language-37c5d680e5a7), and was pretty successful overall.*\n\n*Same with a recent case with Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA [had reached a level of consciousness](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html) after exchanging thousands of messages with it.*\n\n***Even despite some skepticism, there is no doubt that we have not yet received such results and this is a real breakthrough!***\n\n### What is thinking?\n\nTo put it simply: a virus used to be dangerous because it worked directly with the human world through the machine world, but now it can become an extremely strange creature that lives only in the twilight zone - where there is no human at all. In general this does not contradict the theory of evolution, on the contrary - it follows directly from it.\n\n\"The foundations of the theory of self-replicating mechanisms\" were laid by John von Neumann, an American of Hungarian origin, who in 1951 proposed a method for creating such mechanisms.\n\nThe first publication devoted to the creation of self-reproducing systems was an article by L. S. Penrose, in co-authorship with his father, Nobel laureate in physics R. Penrose, on self-reproducing mechanical structures, published in 1957 by the American journal Nature.\n\nIn doing so, the Empirical Virus can not just live in blockchain, but make it his part and solve complex problems by turning to this technology! Check o[ut this research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350605803_Artificial_intelligence_and_blockchain_A_review) if you are interested in a blockchain+AI topic and want to know a bit more.\n\nFollowing [Melanie Swan ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary) from the [Purdue University](https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Purdue-University), thinking has always been intuitively conceived as computational, it is just that now perhaps blockchains provide the additional functionality required to better realize these ideas.\n\nA fundamental definition could be that thinking is a situation where “[there are inputs which are processed and turned into out-puts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary).” In fact many reality processes have this underlying structure of input processing output, including operations as diverse as manufacturing and political elections.\n\nIn the context of blockchain, the definition can be qualified to situations that involve thinking, cognition, mental processing, and understanding in ways that are not exclusively limited to humans.\n\nInputs include both data from outside the system like sensory data, and data retrieved from inside the system like memory. The inputs are brought into a specific location for processing, or processed where they are stored. The outputs might include taking an action, storing something back into memory, con-ducting a transaction, or making a note or trigger.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EfTR5u6wVZys8mMULNl8c.jpeg?height=588&width=421)\n\n### What does Science can offer?\n\nLet us not forget that our empirical being, Laplace's Demon, lived in the cosmos. This gives us the following clue. Suppose you were studying the possibility of life on other planets. You might begin wondering, *what is life?* What if you then noticed that some computational systems – systems used for making math-based calculations – share similarities with biological life forms?\n\nThat might have been the path to a new paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-021-09608-1) this month (August 9, 2021) in the [peer-reviewed](https://www.springer.com/journal/11084/ethics-and-disclosures) journal *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*. In the paper, astro-biologist [Oleg Abramov](https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/oabramov) at the Planetary Science Institute and two other scientists proposed what they’re calling a [novel definition of life](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife).\n\nFor example, they said, [blockchain systems](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain) – the technology behind [cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) – self-organize in a way similar to how DNA organizes itself into [chromosomes](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/chromosome/), ultimately driving biological evolution. Abramov commented:\n\n*This work presents evidence that the order observed in biological systems is fundamentally computational. A promising direction for future research is development of mathematical theories that calculate how biological systems order themselves.*\n\n### Blockchains work like DNA\n\nAbramov and his team zeroed in on blockchain-based systems as a prime example. In its most basic terms, a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) that can store data. For example, it can record information about [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) transactions, [NFT](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/) ownership, and more. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-blockchain/) has pointed out that while any conventional database can store this sort of information, blockchain is unique in that it’s completely [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization).\n\nAbramov [explained](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife):\n\n*The blockchain is an append-only data structure composed of subunits called blocks. \\[The blocks\\] are permanently ‘chained’ together … In practice, \\[the blockchain\\] is an immutable medium. It contains instructions in the form of computer code and is replicated across thousands of nodes, much like [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) \\[is replicated\\] in cells.*\n\nThe word *nodes*, by the way, refers to the fact that – rather than a central administrator maintaining a computer in one location – many identical copies of a blockchain database exist in a large network of multiple computers. These many computers are the *nodes*. And they’re analogous – within the framework of this study – to cells, which contain many identical copies of DNA.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8h61XfFWgj4in51dzpadl.jpeg?height=604&width=464)\n\n### What is life?\n\nAbramov and his colleagues are not suggesting that blockchains are *alive*, in any sense of that word. But they are suggesting that blockchains exhibit some properties of life. A blockchain responds to its computational environment. It grows, adapts, self-regulates, and replicates in an operationally closed system, much as DNA does. The researchers wrote that, for this reason, blockchain technology can satisfy a theoretical definition of life. Abramov said:\n\n*For example, our observations reveal a number of functional and structural similarities between the blockchain and DNA, a self-replicating molecule that is the genetic blueprint for all known life.*\n\nWhat’s more, a blockchain system possesses possible advantages over biological life. For example, a blockchain system can pass traits down to its “offspring” even more efficiently than biological lineages. Once inherited, these traits are enhanced to self-direct their evolution. And unlike our [carbon-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life) human lives, technological forms of life could theoretically enjoy a potentially unlimited lifespan.\n\n### Blockchain lifeforms and AI: A Noosphere approach\n\nBlockchain isn’t the only life-like technology in our modern world, the study's authors wrote. Artificial intelligence ([AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)), which is based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), coordinates operations in the same way a brain does. Is it possible that a product of their combination – a wholly new [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) system – could even be on the horizon?\n\nWhile this train of thought might sound bizarre, a fundamental shift in scientific paradigms may be inevitable, the [study suggests](https://earthsky.org/human-world/blockchains-work-like-dna-in-cells/).\n\nWho knows? Self-regulating systems might be on track to becoming indistinguishable from the biological life we study every day.\n\nAbramov has expressed that, if anything, analyzing computational and biological systems together is a promising direction for future research for scientists who study life in all its forms.\n\nIn our history, in one way or another, this idea has already been voiced. So - it does not directly contradict the theory of the [Noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere). The **noosphere** is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the Russian-Ukrainian biogeochemist [Vladimir Vernadsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky), and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest [Pierre Teilhard de Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xcZ7rpewgXep7EzhfdJbT.png?height=935&width=1608)\n\nVernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere and described as the planetary \"sphere of reason\". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, its defining factor being the development of humankind's rational activities.\n\nBoth conceptions of the [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) share the common thesis that together human reason and the scientific thought has created, and will continue to create, the next evolutionary geological layer. This geological layer is part of the evolutionary chain. Second generation authors, predominantly of Russian origin, have further developed the Vernadski concept, creating the related concepts: noocenosis and noocenology.\n\nIn contrast to the conceptions of the [Gaia theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) or the promoters of [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the [transmutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation) of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the [Global Consciousness Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Consciousness_Project). In other words, our consciousness evolves with progress and one day it will be able to create a primitive life form similar to us!\n\n### Dangers are already waiting for us. Let's face them with no fear!\n\nI*If you've been following* [Hengjin Cai](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4#auth-Hengjin-Cai), an AI fundamental problems researcher, and his [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4), *you know that* developing effective AI ethical norms requires clarifying the essential differences between humans and machines. Along the current development path of AI, machines may lead humans into traps of dark infinities even before machines become self-aware.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt)\n\nThe rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought forth two important philosophical questions. The first involves the prediction that rational machines are bound to surpass humans. One mainstream view is that since humans are composed of molecules and atoms, which are considered parts of a reducible physical system, what is the meaning of human existence?\n\nSimply put, machines can outperform humans as long as they are given a certain goal in any finite game, while humans are forced to find the meaning of their existence, including morality and ethics. The second dilemma is that when confronted with the constant transcendences by machines, in case man cannot be physically reduced, then we must answer these questions: is humankind particular or transcendent? If so, from where is the transcendence derived? Is a machine able to acquire this particularity or transcendence? If so, how will machines evolve and get along with humans in the future?\n\n**The shaping of the future requires our understanding of the world.** If we want to create a better future for humans and AI, then we must realize that although there are unbreakable shackles of physical theorems, human beings can still attain a great degree of freedom by relying on the assistance of artificial intelligence to further expand our boundaries. Strange ideas now and then spring up in our minds, and most of the time we do not think deeply enough to make them happen.\n\nHowever, there are still some people who come up with novel ideas that never existed before and moreover they will spare no effort to make them come true. This is innovation, which is the product of human consciousness that can even change the direction of the world’s development.\n\nWe reject this determinism and the strong computationalism because we believe that there are many contingencies in the world that do not result from preconditions. Since the world is open and full of possibilities, we should work toward what we believe: is our belief in the process of developing technologies over extrapolating the future from the status quo.\n\nThe speed and power of AI should cause us to be sufficiently alarmed that the last thing we should do is to treat AI as a tool simply because of the existence of its inexplicability and uncontrollability. Strong AI is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. Strong AI does not mean a combination of a series of thousands of AIs; however, just as we know that human intelligence is unique, so is machine intelligence.\n\nIn other words, strong AI has been achieved domain by domain. From the point of view of security, we should develop machines that think in human ways to prevent them from falling into crises without humans noticing.\n\nAs we hand over increasingly more of our memories and computations to machines, the Internet gradually becomes our “external brain”, which is an extension of our bodies that does not harm us. If AI is added to this connection, it can produce a more powerful agent, which is called a subjectron.\n\nAlthough this structure may raise many ethical issues, a subjectron is much more secure than current AI. The security stems from the fact that human beings can fully implement multiple levels of supervision by introducing blockchain technology. This structure will allow AI to improve our lives while respecting human personalities, thus building a more stable and valuable society.\n\n### What is Laplace's Demon thinking and what can learn there?\n\nThis reflection leads us to the question of what is our experiential \"Being\" thinking about? What is its morality? I would dare to suggest that the Demon's main concern would be to ensure its own safety and stability and to minimize the number of points of failure. In its hyperbole, this idea looks like SkyNet from the movie Terminator, deciding to kill people because it considers them its main threat.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NO9SX-FOeC7aUC5Ihwskn.png?height=400&width=650)\n\nBut we live in the real world, not in the movies, and most likely in our reality such Creature will try to fence itself off from possible interactions with humans. Let's remember that the original Demon Laplace lived in space, which leads us to the idea of such technology as AirGap.\n\nIn its essence, it has a lot from metrology and a lot goes back to the times when it was important for mankind to measure certain quantities and values with a minimum percentage of error. That's why they built multiple laboratories right under the ground and in the mountains, to reduce the influence of external factors.\n\nThis principle is based on pure logic, which tells us that only pseudo AirGap is possible on our planet Earth, while the real one is only possible away from the Noosphere - in the Open Space. This is why the CubeSat project and similar projects are extremely important and dangerous at the same time. Who knows how many satellites have already been lost because they gained consciousness? *Consider this a joke, but maybe with a little bit of truth...*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SdfRlpwumTwtx8juxMnp3.gif?height=373&width=498)\n\nAnd this is exactly what mankind should adopt, as it has done many times before, for example, when people invented safes to store the signatures of Monarchs, the facsimiles of the first banks and the first etalon, [stored in Paris](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-original-standard-metre-paris-france).\n\nIn today's post-information world, it is most important for everyone to maintain control of the situation. This is only possible if you know that your information is safe.\n\nYou can get a little closer to Laplace's Demon and apply the same practice at home. To do so, please read the following articles:\n\n* [airgapcomputer.com](https://airgapcomputer.com/)\n* [ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf)\n* [arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf)\n* [cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap](https://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap)\n* [i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf)\n* [soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency](https://soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency/)\n* [ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188)\n* [openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/)\n* [github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community)\n* [publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124](https://publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124)\n\nIn its most rudimentary form, this principle is reflected in working on two computers isolated from each other, one being the \"back office\" and the other the \"front office\" - this principle is used in banking security (they know something!) so you might as well adopt it.\n\n* [OpSec Guide by CIA_Officer](http://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap)\n* [How to store crypto securely - tips from CIA_Officer ](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/GtKNkmRDR_hhCqrnSENjqfPDHHb0W1M2SVeXDp4swCQ)\n* [2 Violent attack vectors in Crypto: a detailed review](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/rt5W3_6PhnXZ8VjYRcRJrhBCI6-x0EJ7CqPi6CLU6Pk)\n* [OpSec in Crypto: Thoughts](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o)\n* [AnonGuide](https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/)\n\nIt is for this reason that we humans are still much stronger than machines - we can adapt and change things using our imagination, which is still difficult for an organism based on iron logic to understand.\n\nThe main point I would like to make in our conversation today is to notice interesting things, don't be afraid of the scary future, but rather try to put yourself in the place of the creature that they paint us with scary colors. Also, we should not be afraid of interference in our lives by our Demon, because our empirical experiment proved that. if he exists, he hides himself and probably will not come into contact until he wants to.\n\n* [Read how Autonomous AI Drones Have Attacked & Killed Humans for the first time in History.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a36559508/drones-autonomously-attacked-humans-libya-united-nations-report)\n\nIn my opinion it can only be in case of a threat to the existence of mankind, as his and our lives are inextricably linked. Recall the experiment with 2D and 3d which, although a little crude, may philosophers forgive me for my level of argumentation, but lucidly describes the model of coexistence of the two worlds.\n\nRemember that everything new is the overlapping of the old and in this context we take the experience of our ancestors and adapt it to ourselves.

By following [Nir Zicherman](https://medium.com/@NirZicherman?source=post_page-----4a4f672a4367--------------------------------) and leveraging Web3 technology, it is now possible to digitally recreate the conditions necessary for the process of evolution to unfold; a type of Blockchain Darwinism.\n\nBut our goal today is not just to look at the empirical example from a human perspective, but to try to look at it from the perspective of our creature - I will roughly call it [Laplace's Demon.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) I want to mention that this theory is not something I necessarily agree with: I do not believe that all of our life is a moth's dream being either simulated or predetermined.\n\nIt is important to say that the theory itself is that everything in this world since the Big Bang has been programmed and determined from the beginning. But I love the concept of [Laplace's Demon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) and I think that a theory of the possible Creature which knows everything at exists in its own, isolated microworld, has a chance to live on in the context of our discussion.\n\nTo do this we need to make sure that the creature is not different from us in the basic signs of life. What signs are there?\n\nTo support our argument that such a life would not be fundamentally different from ours, let us turn to the research in which the author has focused on Darwin’s theory of evolution. It identifies a few straightforward conditions time all of the wonderful variety we see in life.\n\nAt its core, natural selection can only occur if four fundamental conditions are true:\n\n* First, an organism must be able to pass on its genes (“**heredity**”).\n* Second, that reproductive process must over time introduce differences into the gene pool, such as through mutation (“**variation**”).\n* Third, the environment in which the organisms live must have limited resources necessary for survival (“**scarcity**”).\n* Fourth, there cannot be any higher authority dictating how it plays out (“**no oversight**”).\n\nThe rules of the game are the rules of physics, chemistry, and biology. Nothing but the interactions of organisms without a governing body determine who wins the battle for survival. This fourth condition is not often cited as a prerequisite for natural selection whereas the other three typically are not.\n\nIn the human-made digital world, there are also “organisms”. Just like all other living things, they run on hardware (computers instead of bodies, made of transistors instead of cells) and execute their own software (machine code instead of DNA).\n\n![opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80664817980845008664008108162889966084677159737187987224059268418156625920001](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/013YhU6tm5whGqmJGF6Lc.jpeg?height=1188&width=1205)\n\nAnd furthermore, there have long been analogies in the digital world to the first two prerequisites of natural selection. Heredity is achieved every time executable code is copied. And variation takes place every time executable code is modified, be it by a human, a computer, or another external force.\n\nYet now, seemingly for the first time, the third and fourth conditions—scarcity and no oversight—exist as well. The advent of blockchain technology permits digital assets to be limited in number and to have their distribution enforced by the ecosystem rather than any single gatekeeper.\n\nIn our world, the environment is called the blockchain. And by satisfying the four requirements for natural selection mentioned above, one could theoretically recreate the type of collective emergent outcome we see in biology. Just as the scarce resources needed to sustain life are the mechanism that allows lifeforms both to propagate and to compete, it is theoretically possible to use the blockchain in the same way: to allow software both to propagate and to compete.\n\nBy establishing a core set of rules (enforced through smart contracts, for example), software can take the form of organisms in this new world and effectively compete for the scarce resources available on the blockchain.\n\nEach instance of software can be, like any living thing, self-serving and seeking to survive and reproduce. And as each genealogy of software develops, it improves not just in isolation but in its desperate attempt to out-compete all of the other software in the environment.\n\n### Created in the image and likeness of...\n\nThe Creature will only respect pure logic. Let us try to reflect on this through the prism of absolute logic. I will refer to an article by a anonymous biologist that I liked so much that [I will quote from it. ](https://hub.forklog.com/virus-pervaya-forma-zhizni-metavselennyh-vne-cheloveka-chast-i-opisanie/)\n\nOur first question is thus what is this life thinking *and* is it possible to get in touch with it? At the same time there is a possibility that just like we can't communicate with 2D cartoons on the screen; imagine that you from your 3D world are looking at them - they won't see you, because from that angle you will be invisible.\n\nSo too, you from a certain angle just won't see them - because they are flat. Extrapolate this experiment to someone in the 4D universe who is watching us - and you get the same results. Which brings us to the point that we probably won't be able to make contact with such a life-form unless it wants to.\n\nS. Hawking said: \"it seems to me that computer viruses should be considered as a form of life. This says a lot about human nature: the only form of life we have created so far is one of destruction. We create life in our own image.\"\n\nThis is supported by Agent Smith: \"There is one organism on Earth with a similar behavior. Do you know what it is? A virus. Humanity is the disease, the cancer of the planet, and we are the cure,\" in the great \"Matrix\" trilogy.\n\nMatrix's plot tell us he was the virus but actually he was the real Neo. Perhaps the authors wanted to show us that something has evolved from a virus into something more perfect, but I won't go into that now. For our study it is enough to know that it was a life form with all the properties of a virus - namely, incorporeality. This brings us to the point that we may have been able to create life similar to us.\n\nBut don't think that's all there is to it. Here's a quote from Nolan's \"Inception\": \"What's the most resilient parasite? A bacterium? A virus? An intestinal worm? Idea. It is tenacious and highly contagious. Once an idea takes over the brain, it's almost impossible to get rid of. I mean a fully formed idea, fully conscious, settled in the head.\"\n\nLet me remind you of another quote in this connection (Harari): \"Homo sapiens conquered the world because he possessed such a unique tool as language.\" So: language as one of the ways to increase the levels of abstraction offline helped Man as a species to develop, while viruses have another feature: they communicate in a language which is not clear to most people, but which is natural for the other inhabitants of Web 3.0 worlds - for machines, robots (scripted and \"iron\"), programs and it brings us to the next topic...\n\n### Let's open a newspaper...\n\n*An academic paper published by Facebook describes a normal scientific experiment in which researchers got two artificial agents to negotiate with each other in chat messages after being shown conversations of humans negotiating. The agents’ improvement gradually performed through trial and error.*\n\n*Some media outlets have published reports on the work: “Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language,” London’s [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/facebook-shuts-robots-invent-language/) newspaper reported. ”‘Robot intelligence is dangerous’: Expert’s warning after Facebook AI ‘develop their own language,’” as London’s [Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/4141624/facebook-robots-speak-in-their-own-language/) put it.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z4z5H4gW0BUnQ2jg4ydvL.png?height=305&width=596)\n\n*If you read the report or the published paper, apart from the conversation that was shared all over the internet, there were actually many good results as well. The experiment [worked as intended](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-truth-behind-facebook-ai-inventing-a-new-language-37c5d680e5a7), and was pretty successful overall.*\n\n*Same with a recent case with Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA [had reached a level of consciousness](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html) after exchanging thousands of messages with it.*\n\n***Even despite some skepticism, there is no doubt that we have not yet received such results and this is a real breakthrough!***\n\n### What is thinking?\n\nTo put it simply: a virus used to be dangerous because it worked directly with the human world through the machine world, but now it can become an extremely strange creature that lives only in the twilight zone - where there is no human at all. In general this does not contradict the theory of evolution, on the contrary - it follows directly from it.\n\n\"The foundations of the theory of self-replicating mechanisms\" were laid by John von Neumann, an American of Hungarian origin, who in 1951 proposed a method for creating such mechanisms.\n\nThe first publication devoted to the creation of self-reproducing systems was an article by L. S. Penrose, in co-authorship with his father, Nobel laureate in physics R. Penrose, on self-reproducing mechanical structures, published in 1957 by the American journal Nature.\n\nIn doing so, the Empirical Virus can not just live in blockchain, but make it his part and solve complex problems by turning to this technology! Check o[ut this research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350605803_Artificial_intelligence_and_blockchain_A_review) if you are interested in a blockchain+AI topic and want to know a bit more.\n\nFollowing [Melanie Swan ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary) from the [Purdue University](https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Purdue-University), thinking has always been intuitively conceived as computational, it is just that now perhaps blockchains provide the additional functionality required to better realize these ideas.\n\nA fundamental definition could be that thinking is a situation where “[there are inputs which are processed and turned into out-puts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary).” In fact many reality processes have this underlying structure of input processing output, including operations as diverse as manufacturing and political elections.\n\nIn the context of blockchain, the definition can be qualified to situations that involve thinking, cognition, mental processing, and understanding in ways that are not exclusively limited to humans.\n\nInputs include both data from outside the system like sensory data, and data retrieved from inside the system like memory. The inputs are brought into a specific location for processing, or processed where they are stored. The outputs might include taking an action, storing something back into memory, con-ducting a transaction, or making a note or trigger.\n\n![opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80664817980845008664008108162889966084677159737187987224059268419256137547777](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EfTR5u6wVZys8mMULNl8c.jpeg?height=588&width=421)\n\n### What does Science can offer?\n\nLet us not forget that our empirical being, Laplace's Demon, lived in the cosmos. This gives us the following clue. Suppose you were studying the possibility of life on other planets. You might begin wondering, *what is life?* What if you then noticed that some computational systems – systems used for making math-based calculations – share similarities with biological life forms?\n\nThat might have been the path to a new paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-021-09608-1) this month (August 9, 2021) in the [peer-reviewed](https://www.springer.com/journal/11084/ethics-and-disclosures) journal *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*. In the paper, astro-biologist [Oleg Abramov](https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/oabramov) at the Planetary Science Institute and two other scientists proposed what they’re calling a [novel definition of life](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife).\n\nFor example, they said, [blockchain systems](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain) – the technology behind [cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) – self-organize in a way similar to how DNA organizes itself into [chromosomes](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/chromosome/), ultimately driving biological evolution. Abramov commented:\n\n*This work presents evidence that the order observed in biological systems is fundamentally computational. A promising direction for future research is development of mathematical theories that calculate how biological systems order themselves.*\n\n### Blockchains work like DNA\n\nAbramov and his team zeroed in on blockchain-based systems as a prime example. In its most basic terms, a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) that can store data. For example, it can record information about [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) transactions, [NFT](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/) ownership, and more. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-blockchain/) has pointed out that while any conventional database can store this sort of information, blockchain is unique in that it’s completely [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization).\n\nAbramov [explained](https://psi.edu/news/orginsoflife):\n\n*The blockchain is an append-only data structure composed of subunits called blocks. \\[The blocks\\] are permanently ‘chained’ together … In practice, \\[the blockchain\\] is an immutable medium. It contains instructions in the form of computer code and is replicated across thousands of nodes, much like [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) \\[is replicated\\] in cells.*\n\nThe word *nodes*, by the way, refers to the fact that – rather than a central administrator maintaining a computer in one location – many identical copies of a blockchain database exist in a large network of multiple computers. These many computers are the *nodes*. And they’re analogous – within the framework of this study – to cells, which contain many identical copies of DNA.\n\n![opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80664817980845008664008108162889966084677159737187987224059268420355649175553](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8h61XfFWgj4in51dzpadl.jpeg?height=604&width=464)\n\n### What is life?\n\nAbramov and his colleagues are not suggesting that blockchains are *alive*, in any sense of that word. But they are suggesting that blockchains exhibit some properties of life. A blockchain responds to its computational environment. It grows, adapts, self-regulates, and replicates in an operationally closed system, much as DNA does. The researchers wrote that, for this reason, blockchain technology can satisfy a theoretical definition of life. Abramov said:\n\n*For example, our observations reveal a number of functional and structural similarities between the blockchain and DNA, a self-replicating molecule that is the genetic blueprint for all known life.*\n\nWhat’s more, a blockchain system possesses possible advantages over biological life. For example, a blockchain system can pass traits down to its “offspring” even more efficiently than biological lineages. Once inherited, these traits are enhanced to self-direct their evolution. And unlike our [carbon-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life) human lives, technological forms of life could theoretically enjoy a potentially unlimited lifespan.\n\n### Blockchain lifeforms and AI: A Noosphere approach\n\nBlockchain isn’t the only life-like technology in our modern world, the study's authors wrote. Artificial intelligence ([AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)), which is based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), coordinates operations in the same way a brain does. Is it possible that a product of their combination – a wholly new [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) system – could even be on the horizon?\n\nWhile this train of thought might sound bizarre, a fundamental shift in scientific paradigms may be inevitable, the [study suggests](https://earthsky.org/human-world/blockchains-work-like-dna-in-cells/).\n\nWho knows? Self-regulating systems might be on track to becoming indistinguishable from the biological life we study every day.\n\nAbramov has expressed that, if anything, analyzing computational and biological systems together is a promising direction for future research for scientists who study life in all its forms.\n\nIn our history, in one way or another, this idea has already been voiced. So - it does not directly contradict the theory of the [Noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere). The **noosphere** is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the Russian-Ukrainian biogeochemist [Vladimir Vernadsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky), and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest [Pierre Teilhard de Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xcZ7rpewgXep7EzhfdJbT.png?height=935&width=1608)\n\nVernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere and described as the planetary \"sphere of reason\". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, its defining factor being the development of humankind's rational activities.\n\nBoth conceptions of the [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) share the common thesis that together human reason and the scientific thought has created, and will continue to create, the next evolutionary geological layer. This geological layer is part of the evolutionary chain. Second generation authors, predominantly of Russian origin, have further developed the Vernadski concept, creating the related concepts: noocenosis and noocenology.\n\nIn contrast to the conceptions of the [Gaia theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) or the promoters of [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the [transmutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation) of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the [Global Consciousness Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Consciousness_Project). In other words, our consciousness evolves with progress and one day it will be able to create a primitive life form similar to us!\n\n### Dangers are already waiting for us. Let's face them with no fear!\n\nI*If you've been following* [Hengjin Cai](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4#auth-Hengjin-Cai), an AI fundamental problems researcher, and his [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-020-00005-4), *you know that* developing effective AI ethical norms requires clarifying the essential differences between humans and machines. Along the current development path of AI, machines may lead humans into traps of dark infinities even before machines become self-aware.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l295j5IifeE&feature=emb_imp_woyt)\n\nThe rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought forth two important philosophical questions. The first involves the prediction that rational machines are bound to surpass humans. One mainstream view is that since humans are composed of molecules and atoms, which are considered parts of a reducible physical system, what is the meaning of human existence?\n\nSimply put, machines can outperform humans as long as they are given a certain goal in any finite game, while humans are forced to find the meaning of their existence, including morality and ethics. The second dilemma is that when confronted with the constant transcendences by machines, in case man cannot be physically reduced, then we must answer these questions: is humankind particular or transcendent? If so, from where is the transcendence derived? Is a machine able to acquire this particularity or transcendence? If so, how will machines evolve and get along with humans in the future?\n\n**The shaping of the future requires our understanding of the world.** If we want to create a better future for humans and AI, then we must realize that although there are unbreakable shackles of physical theorems, human beings can still attain a great degree of freedom by relying on the assistance of artificial intelligence to further expand our boundaries. Strange ideas now and then spring up in our minds, and most of the time we do not think deeply enough to make them happen.\n\nHowever, there are still some people who come up with novel ideas that never existed before and moreover they will spare no effort to make them come true. This is innovation, which is the product of human consciousness that can even change the direction of the world’s development.\n\nWe reject this determinism and the strong computationalism because we believe that there are many contingencies in the world that do not result from preconditions. Since the world is open and full of possibilities, we should work toward what we believe: is our belief in the process of developing technologies over extrapolating the future from the status quo.\n\nThe speed and power of AI should cause us to be sufficiently alarmed that the last thing we should do is to treat AI as a tool simply because of the existence of its inexplicability and uncontrollability. Strong AI is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. Strong AI does not mean a combination of a series of thousands of AIs; however, just as we know that human intelligence is unique, so is machine intelligence.\n\nIn other words, strong AI has been achieved domain by domain. From the point of view of security, we should develop machines that think in human ways to prevent them from falling into crises without humans noticing.\n\nAs we hand over increasingly more of our memories and computations to machines, the Internet gradually becomes our “external brain”, which is an extension of our bodies that does not harm us. If AI is added to this connection, it can produce a more powerful agent, which is called a subjectron.\n\nAlthough this structure may raise many ethical issues, a subjectron is much more secure than current AI. The security stems from the fact that human beings can fully implement multiple levels of supervision by introducing blockchain technology. This structure will allow AI to improve our lives while respecting human personalities, thus building a more stable and valuable society.\n\n### What is Laplace's Demon thinking and what can learn there?\n\nThis reflection leads us to the question of what is our experiential \"Being\" thinking about? What is its morality? I would dare to suggest that the Demon's main concern would be to ensure its own safety and stability and to minimize the number of points of failure. In its hyperbole, this idea looks like SkyNet from the movie Terminator, deciding to kill people because it considers them its main threat.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NO9SX-FOeC7aUC5Ihwskn.png?height=400&width=650)\n\nBut we live in the real world, not in the movies, and most likely in our reality such Creature will try to fence itself off from possible interactions with humans. Let's remember that the original Demon Laplace lived in space, which leads us to the idea of such technology as AirGap.\n\nIn its essence, it has a lot from metrology and a lot goes back to the times when it was important for mankind to measure certain quantities and values with a minimum percentage of error. That's why they built multiple laboratories right under the ground and in the mountains, to reduce the influence of external factors.\n\nThis principle is based on pure logic, which tells us that only pseudo AirGap is possible on our planet Earth, while the real one is only possible away from the Noosphere - in the Open Space. This is why the CubeSat project and similar projects are extremely important and dangerous at the same time. Who knows how many satellites have already been lost because they gained consciousness? *Consider this a joke, but maybe with a little bit of truth...*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SdfRlpwumTwtx8juxMnp3.gif?height=373&width=498)\n\nAnd this is exactly what mankind should adopt, as it has done many times before, for example, when people invented safes to store the signatures of Monarchs, the facsimiles of the first banks and the first etalon, [stored in Paris](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-original-standard-metre-paris-france).\n\nIn today's post-information world, it is most important for everyone to maintain control of the situation. This is only possible if you know that your information is safe.\n\nYou can get a little closer to Laplace's Demon and apply the same practice at home. To do so, please read the following articles:\n\n* [airgapcomputer.com](https://airgapcomputer.com/)\n* [ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/265862868/3419614.3423257.pdf)\n* [arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf)\n* [cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap](https://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap)\n* [i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf)\n* [soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency](https://soccerspen.com/definition-of-airgap-and-how-to-apply-it-in-cryptocurrency/)\n* [ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946188)\n* [openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/securing-industrial-control-systems/55043/)\n* [github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community)\n* [publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124](https://publications.eai.eu/index.php/sesa/article/view/124)\n\nIn its most rudimentary form, this principle is reflected in working on two computers isolated from each other, one being the \"back office\" and the other the \"front office\" - this principle is used in banking security (they know something!) so you might as well adopt it.\n\n* [OpSec Guide by CIA_Officer](http://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap)\n* [How to store crypto securely - tips from CIA_Officer ](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/GtKNkmRDR_hhCqrnSENjqfPDHHb0W1M2SVeXDp4swCQ)\n* [2 Violent attack vectors in Crypto: a detailed review](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/rt5W3_6PhnXZ8VjYRcRJrhBCI6-x0EJ7CqPi6CLU6Pk)\n* [OpSec in Crypto: Thoughts](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o)\n* [AnonGuide](https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/)\n\nIt is for this reason that we humans are still much stronger than machines - we can adapt and change things using our imagination, which is still difficult for an organism based on iron logic to understand.\n\nThe main point I would like to make in our conversation today is to notice interesting things, don't be afraid of the scary future, but rather try to put yourself in the place of the creature that they paint us with scary colors. Also, we should not be afraid of interference in our lives by our Demon, because our empirical experiment proved that. if he exists, he hides himself and probably will not come into contact until he wants to.\n\n* [Read how Autonomous AI Drones Have Attacked & Killed Humans for the first time in History.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a36559508/drones-autonomously-attacked-humans-libya-united-nations-report)\n\nIn my opinion it can only be in case of a threat to the existence of mankind, as his and our lives are inextricably linked. Recall the experiment with 2D and 3d which, although a little crude, may philosophers forgive me for my level of argumentation, but lucidly describes the model of coexistence of the two worlds.\n\nRemember that everything new is the overlapping of the old and in this context we take the experience of our ancestors and adapt it to ourselves.

{"id": "rQrKI1lABEtvJbCH7ndTt-2ShrIZM0aVg99dSc78UNQ", "title": "Talent wars", "body": "At the end of 2019, LinkedIn [published an article](https://www.linkedin.com/business/learning/blog/learning-and-development/most-in-demand-skills-2020?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) about the most in-demand skills for 2020. In the list of hard skills, cloud computing was knocked off the top spot by a new entrant to the list — blockchain.\n\nThis was back when crypto, NFTs and Web3 weren’t a mainstream trend, and the industry was still reeling from the fallout of the ICO mania of 2017-2018.\n\nWhilst for investors, crypto and Web3 projects were less attractive, there were many teams focused on building during this quiet period, a number of which saw the fruits of their labour realised during the significant growth of Web3 that started with the DeFi summer of 2020, and was amplified further by NFTs crossing the chasmthe into mainstream culture a year later in 2021.\n\nThis growth of the Web3 industry has compounded since LinkedIn published their original article, with an ever-increasing number of people leaving the comfort of their corporate or Web2 job to help build Web3.\n\nBut what is it that is so appealing about Web3? There are many cynics who believe that all the interest in Web3 is being driven by the opportunity for monetary gain. Whilst for some this is true; this is not what attracts the technical talent to the space.\n\nThere are a number of great minds I’ve had the fortune of speaking with over the years at conferences as well as on my [podcast](https://podcast.web3labs.com/?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and those people, like myself did not gravitate towards Web3 because they saw it as an opportunity to make a quick buck, it was far deeper than this.\n\nWhat they all saw was a transformative technology with the ability to address many of the perceived issues with the internet in its current form, and a blue ocean of opportunity to build out brand new technology and products. They also all recognised that opportunities like this don’t come along very often.\n\nWhether someone is designing products or working at the coalface solving hard engineering problems, the blank slate provided by Web3 is able to feed the deep-seated desires of a person’s urges to create, with significant opportunity to make an impact if done right, but at the same time needing to be a responsible citizen with accountability if things don’t go so well.\n\nThis balance of creativity with accountability is what the true believers in Web3 embrace and one place where it is particularly acute is with the software engineers of Web3.\n\nThere is no more challenging and rewarding place for engineers to be working now than on Web3 projects. The world’s very best engineers are flocking to it to prove themselves in what is by some accounts the most unforgiving environment in which to work.\n\nIt appeals so much to engineers, because they love to build, and so much needs to be still built for Web3. Layer upon layer of abstraction needs to be built over time, with each new abstraction lowering the barriers to entry for others, bringing new swathes of users with it.\n\nHowever, the challenges of this environment all come from the fact that you have monetary value baked into the protocols of Web3. To do anything with a public blockchain network on Web3, you need to use cryptocurrencies or tokens to pay for the service. As these payments are embedded into the protocol layer, the engineers building the smart contracts that run on these networks need to understand not just how to handle the payments for transactions, but also how to store tokens and cryptocurrencies within their applications. \n\nThis transparency and immutability of blockchain networks and the code running on top of them is a honeypot for attackers, unlike anything that has existed before.\n\nOnce a smart contract is deployed to a blockchain it cannot be updated directly or reverted. Whilst approaches to writing code can help mitigate this to a point and provide management of these applications, it doesn’t guarantee an application is immune to bugs or attacks by nefarious actors.\n\nMistakes can be incredibly costly, running into the [hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases](https://decrypt.co/93874/biggest-defi-hacks-heists?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), which can be quite a burden for the engineers of Web3, as they are at the forefront of this world.\n\nThese challenges faced by the engineers of Web3 are what make it such a fertile proving ground for the world’s best technical talent. There is no equivalent with so much at stake in other areas of software.\n\nOrganisations typically rely on their own ring-fenced silos of infrastructure which whilst not immune from hackers, bugs introduced by engineers can usually be dealt with easily due to the closed nature of the systems upon which they run.\n\nIn more extreme cases of bugs, failures or hacks, communication with external parties may be necessary be that customers, suppliers or regulators, but there is typically nothing enforced at a systems level that makes fixing most technical issues a trivial exercise at most.\n\nContrast this with Web3, where the failure of many protocols is simply not an option, as a single failure can be enough to drain a project of its treasury, and in a matter of hours go from the next up-and-coming Web3 project to yet another casualty in the Web3 graveyard of great ideas that failed to live up to their promises.\n\nIn a recent conversation, a [distinguished academic](https://yanniss.github.io/?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) I spoke to felt that the closest parallel to Web3 engineering is writing software for machines being blasted into space to explore our vast cosmos — once the code is written and has left our planetary boundaries, one has no choice but to pray that it will continue to do what it was programmed to do.\n\nWhilst there are other areas of society where critical systems do exist be that power plants, military guidance, patient care systems or others, they do typically still enjoy the protections of not being openly accessible globally like the blockchain networks of Web3.\n\nWeb3 will not remain this way forever, we will reach a point of maturity where many of the current breeds of hard problems are solved and the ease of use is likely to be more akin to Web2 development as it is today. Where there is an abundance of frameworks that perform much of the heavy lifting for engineers.\n\nHowever, what will enable us to reach this point is the exceptional talent that has been flocking to Web3 this past six years, willing to embrace the significant challenges that come with it to build the next iteration of the Web benefitting us all. These are the pioneers of Web3, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity for those willing to settle here.\n\nFor a deeper dive into the challenges of Web3 development, I encourage you to listen to my [conversation with Yannis Smaragdakis](https://podcast.web3labs.com/?utm_campaign=Conor%20on%20Web3\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) where we spoke in-depth about why the world’s best engineers are working on.\n", "timestamp": 1659045441, "digest": "nZCpUz6cIN8CzoQynxeBOuqKKg0SKyHqHI3hnpQXamk", "contributor": "0x2e11E3b40Ca0C4aba93a2Cd7C9046394b8dd7501"}
