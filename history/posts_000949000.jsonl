Synths(ตัวย่อของ Synthetix assets) ของ Synthetix นั้น สามารถอิง assets ครอบคลุมถึง คริปโต, หุ้น, น้ำมัน, ค่าเงิน และอื่นๆ ในอนาคต\n\nการสร้าง Synths นั้น จะเริ่มจากที่ Synthetix stakers จะเป็นผู้ค้ำประกัน sUSD ที่ถูก mint มาจาก dApp โดย stakers จะต้องนำเอา SNX (Synthetix Token) มาล็อคไว้และ mint sUSD ซึ่งคำนวนจากมูลค่าของ SNX ในอัตรา 300% มาค้ำประกัน ยกตัวอย่าง Stakers นำ SNX ที่มีมูลค่า $300 (SNX) ไป mint ที่ dApp ซึ่งจะได้มาเป็น $100 sUSD เป็นต้น หลังจากนั้นเมื่อผู้ใช้(ใครก็ตามไม่จำเป็นจะต้องเป็น stakers) มี sUSD ไม่ว่าจะได้มาจากการ mint หรือซื้อมาจาก dApp อื่น เช่น Curve, Uniswap หรือ AAVE ก็สามารถเปลี่ยน sUSD ไปเป็น synths อื่นๆ ตามที่ต้องการได้ (sETH, sBTC, หรือ sXAU) โดยนำ sUSD ไป swap ผ่าน Frontend ที่ทำการนำ Synthetix Protocol ไป integrate เช่น Kwenta\n\n> Synthetix เลยมี single pool ที่เรียกว่า debt pool เพื่อเป็นศูนย์กลางของ Synths ทั้งหมด ซึ่งจะถูกรับผิดชอบโดย stakers. Synthetix จึงเป็นเหมือน “**Liquidity pool”** บน DeFi ที่เป็นพื้นฐานสำคัญให้ Protocols อื่นๆ นำสภาพคล่องนี้(Liquidity) ไปต่อยอดสินค้าอย่าง Derivatives ได้อย่างหลากหลาย\n\n### ทำไมต้อง Synthetix\n\n* **Best price execution** **:** ผู้ใช้งานสามาถแลกเปลี่ยน synths ในราคาที่ดีที่สุดโดยแทบไม่มี slippage เลย ทำให้มั่นใจได้ว่าราคาที่แลกเปลี่ยนนั้นคงที่\n* **Lowest Downtime & Liquidation Risk :** ใน CEXs นั้น ในช่วงที่ตลาดมีความผันผวนมาก จะเป็นการยากที่จะทำการซื้อ-ขายในช่วงนั้น(downtime) การซื้อ-ขาย synths ทำผ่าน Optimism network ซึ่งก็มั่นใจได้ว่าผู้ใช้สามารถเทรดได้ และผู้ใช้จะไม่ถูก forced selloffs หากกำลังเผชิญกับ cascading liquidation ที่เกิด downtime แบบใน CEXs\n* **Simulated Liquidity** **:** ผู้ใช้สามารถเทรดโดยไม่ต้องกังวลกับคู่เหรียญ เช่น sETH > sXAU, หรือ sCHF > sSOL ได้ โดยยังคงคุณสมบัติ best price execution\n* **Secure Layer 2 : อยู่บน** Optimism ที่เป็น EVM equivalent และใช้ security ของ Ethereum Mainnet, มีการโค้ดโปรแกรมที่ง่ายทำให้เงินของผู้ใช้ปลอดภัย\n* **Any Asset Class :** สามารถเพิ่ม asset class อะไรก็ได้ โดยจะถูกบริหารผ่าน community\n* **Low Gas and Fees :** บน L2 นั้นใช้ gas น้อยกว่า L1 มาก ซึ่งก็จะมีโอกาสถูกลงไปเรื่อยๆ และทำธุรกรรมเสร็จโดนทันที\n* **Stake & Earn :** ผู้ใช้สามารถนำเอา SNX โทเค็นไปค้ำประกันโดยการ stake และจะได้รับรางวัลเป็น SNX โทเค็นจากการเพิ่มขึ้นของ SNX supply(Tokenomics) และ sUSD จาก fees ที่ได้รับจาก protocol ในทุกสัปดาห์\n* **Permissionless & Composable** **:** โปรเจ็กอื่นๆ สามารถนำเอาจุดเด่นของ DeFi blockchain โดยนำเอา perpetual futures contracts ไปใช้ในประโยชน์ต่างๆ ได้\n\n## SNX Ecosystem\n\nLiquidity pool นั้นเป็นหนึ่งในหัวใจสำคัญของ Synthetix มี Protocols นำประโยชน์จาก Synths นี้ไปต่อยอด เช่น Kwenta(Futures), Lyra(Options), Thales(Parimutuel Markets), Aelin, Curve, 1inch, Paraswap, dHedge, Yearn และยังมีอีกหลาย Protocols ต่อยอดไปจาก Lyra อีก เช่น Polynomials, Brahma, Fuerte เนื่องจาก Composable ของ Blockchain เปิดทางให้ Protocols นั้นเชื่อมต่อกันได้ง่าย มันจึงมีโอกาสอีกมากมายที่ทำให้ Synthetix เติบโตได้ในหลายรูปแบบ การที่หลายๆ Protocols นำเอา Liquidity ไปใช้นั้น จะทำให้ Synthetix ได้รับ fees จากธุรกรรมที่เกิดขึ้นและเป็นรายได้เข้าสู่ Synthetix และตกสู่ SNX Stakers หรือ SNX Holders ในที่สุด\n\n![Synthetix ecosystem](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IzS9IccxY8hlsQJv4QUKK.png?height=406&width=637)\n\n### Kwenta (เควน-ต้า)\n\nKwenta เป็น Decentralized Exchange Protocol ที่มีไว้ให้ผู้ใช้ซื้อ-ขาย Synths แบบ Spot หรือ Futures โดยนำ Liquidity และกลไกการซื้อ-ขาย(Exchange Mechanism) ที่ล้ำหน้ามาใช้เป็น Frontend ให้กับ Synthetix\n\nKwenta เป็นโปรเจ็กที่ใกล้ชิดกับ Synthetix มากที่สุด ซึ่งก่อนหน้านี้ Synthetix มี Synthetix.exchange แล้วเปลี่ยนมาเป็น Kwenta ใน L1 Mainnet หลังจากนั้น Synthetix ก็ได้ย้ายมา Optimism network เหตุเพราะว่า L1 นั้นไม่สามารถ scale ได้และมี fees ที่สูง จึงเป็นข้อจำกัดของการเติบโตของ Synthetix.

{"id": "-U5GBFoPEjM3Ktpjcl8ma19ZEJ8L2xyeoWSmiBZjAwU", "title": "After brand identity: a designer’s journey", "body": "### Storytelling lessons from a web3 branding project\n\nI recently saw this image in my Twitter feed, captioned with the sentence: \"Literally every web3 project\".\n\n![\"Literally every web3 project\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FCdzKQriJVwICMRy5ZJXp.jpg?height=751&width=1500)\n\nI giggled along at first. Later, I thought about that tweet again, and I realised it was right! At the time, I was designing prototypes for our web3 app, [After.](https://after.fund/)\n\nMy experience was so interesting and enlightening that I felt it could be helpful for other designers, too. So, here I will showcase my **brand-design journey**, and describe the lessons I have learned.\n\n### Preliminary research\n\nMy eye-opening research on different web3 projects brought up **a wealth of identikit brands** that reflected everything the infamous tweet describes.\n\n![Similar illustrations and font style among web3 projects websites](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Jrl6CSsOymorWTZDwDgi.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThese results also show that when it comes to branding a web3 project, designers can be somewhat clueless. This is partly because such projects tend to focus on rigid technical concepts that feel abstract and unfamiliar.\n\nOther designers simply feel **overwhelmed by the infinite possibilities at their feet.**  Consider that most of these projects live exclusively in the digital world: hence, just about anything is possible! So why is it that we keep on doing the same things?\n\n### Storytelling is the answer\n\nThis is not the first time I have talked about \"storytelling\".  That’s because for me, **storytelling is more than a buzzword.**\n\nStorytelling is my only way of working, and **the only path that leads a brand towards a strong, relatable sense of identity and purpose.** This is compounded when we consider that, most of the time, both (identity and purpose) are sorely lacking from web3 brand identities.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I will illustrate the three steps that helped create our company's story.\n\n## Lesson01. Write your story from who you are, no matter how complex the technology or intangible the project.\n\nMost web3 projects try to paint a sophisticated brand identity, often using abstract and/or futuristic illustrations and imagery (*lesson 03*), blunt typography, and neon colours to explain who they are.\n\nThis is as far as their identities go, so no wonder they all look alike.\n\nFrom experience, I understand all too well that if you can’t explain “who you are” through images, you’ll also struggle to communicate your unique identity through words (aka content, *see lesson 02*).\n\nThe task becomes even more complicated when even you don’t know why your brand exists!\n\nTo overcome this issue, the first stage in branding your next web3 project is to **define your key differentiators** (in the form of a mission, vision, values and purpose). Only then will you **create a story that allows others to understand and share your beliefs.**\n\n**After** uses the blockchain technology of smart contracts to create **an automated, transparent, immutable, and private distribution of assets** at an event-based future trigger (for example the death of a person, or a change in their Will).\n\nAnswering Marty Neumeier's questionnaire (a set of 17 questions to find the *Onliness Statement*, that cardinal distinction that can help the business owners to create a prosperous brand.), we defined that our company's mission is **to help people realise the power of wealth.**\n\nFor this reason, the main inspiration for our story derives from the keys of Pluto. According to the Orphic Hymn to Pluto, among many other attributes, Pluto owns the keys that connect with God's capacity to give humanity wealth.\n\nIn ancient Greek burial practices, the **keys** symbolised revelations that the deceased was obligated to keep secret, along with a coin placed in their mouth to ensure a safe passage into the next world.\n\nWith such rich references to draw upon, the key became an essential visual element of After's branding, while the coin became **After's utility token #OBOL.**\n\n![After brandmark](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1lEDbqUMzrvrBRm4WMmDt.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n**After's brandmark is a key**, which features a bespoke design of the capital letter A on the top. This brandmark is enclosed in a geometric hexagonal shape, representing the value of privacy and secrecy.\n\nThis sophisticated and elegant brandmark is paired with **a bespoke sans serif typeface** representing the bold encrypted structure behind creating a Will through After's platform.\n\nThe design of the capital letter above the key is also used to represent the utility token #OBOL.\n\n![#OBOL symbol and tokenomics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7AYiTtGX0_1h-DNybLFJV.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Lesson 02. Build a community through content, and project personality through fonts.\n\nIn a world that is entirely digital, such as web3, typefaces can break traditional print-rules and enjoy the freedom they deserve on-screen… where they can be the stars!\n\nUnfortunately, when they are overused, large, animated typefaces create a bustling environment that tires our eyes and drains our minds’ focus from the rightful heart of the brand’s storytelling: **content.**\n\nOne beautiful side of the de-centralised web is the **communities** that form from similarities in specific ideas, and your project’s unique values (as explained in *lesson 01*). So, the right content is critical.\n\nIf this interaction is missing, you will deprive your users of **meaningful participation in the web3 experience.** No matter how fancy and futuristic your project is, make sure your typeface is also clear, legible, and humanly expressive, so it can properly introduce your project to its users.\n\nFor **After**, we wanted to build a community whose **values could inspire future generations.** After must communicate a sense of immutability and permanence, because this is our promise to the community.\n\nOur content also reflects how After speaks to **a primal human need** (the desire to ensure a better future for our loved ones), which is powered by blockchain technology (immutability and permanence).\n\n![Organization of the content on After landing page](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pj0WuTw5eHDE-_MRYa1c3.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nOur values and duality are revealed in our specific choice of typeface.\n\nWe opted for **Frank Rhule Libre**, the digital version of a traditional serif typeface used mainly in print.  We then paired this with a modern sans serif font, **Lato**, which is exclusively designed for the digital world (though it looks good in print, too!).\n\nThe sans serif has been used in every header, to deliver essential concepts and help readers to scan the page effortlessly.\n\nLato, meanwhile, has been widely used in long paragraphs for its semi-rounded details that aid readability, as well as offering a sense of gravitas.\n\n![Some slides of our pitch deck to illustrate the usage of the typeface](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kt4Ms5XBxN853vjLjAkIH.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nStorytelling also helped us to elaborate the delicate **concept of death** in a personal and expressive way, focusing on positive legacy rather than heartbreak. For this reason, the word **\"departure\"** was chosen over “death”.\n\nOur users are referred to as **Afterists**: people who have taken control of defining a positive future for their loved ones.\n\n**After** also promises to make the **journey** towards creating a Will both pleasant and accessible – a simple process that is literally at their fingertips.\n\n## Lesson 03. Illustrate your story: create differentiation with your own visual language.\n\nColours and illustrations are powerful storytelling methods.\nHowever, if your web3 project's visual language feels similar to that of so many other projects, **how can you differentiate yourself?**\n\nAs we have already touched upon, the alarming similarity is likely due to your attempt to explain the technology behind the project (which most of the time is complicated and feels unfamiliar), rather than explaining the values and purpose of your brand.\n\nWhen illustrated with intention, **a compelling story has the power to spark conversation.**\n\nIf you explore your company's key differentiators (mission, values and purpose), you will be forced to **think creatively about your brand's unique story**, and how you can harness its competitive power.\n\nIn the case of **After**, our values inspired our colours: from the very light, like white and pink (emotion, afterlife, purity, clarity, meditation, light), to darker, more sophisticated shades like purple and black (wealth, death, meaning, passage, spiritual).\n\n![After brand colors and values associated with each color ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zqXv2o4DfhxfKWGldDAxW.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThis content (including our mission and purpose) inspired our illustrations.\n\nAs we mentioned in *lesson 02*, we used the words *journey* and *departure* to introduce and explain our app. An inspirational story, the Myth of Pluto, describes **the journey in the afterlife.**\n\nHence, I created a series of illustrations that visualise the passage of our Afterists to a world that is peaceful and everlasting, crafted from expansive architecture and infinite skies.\n\nThe illustrations are also part of **a** **non-fungible token (NFT) collection called Elysium** (from the Greek, *Ēlýsion pedion*; a conception of the afterlife developed over time by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults).\n\nThe Elysium artworks, or NFTs, will be distributed as a ‘pass’ to join the community. Only pass holders can unlock community-specific channels, or gain access to exclusive perks and rewards.\n\n![Samples of Elysium NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q1zRxx_Gl6Btv7C73z3hr.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Takeaways\n\nIn a world that changes so rapidly, storytelling can help web3 projects hold users’ attention, as they build lasting and memorable community connections.

Let there be light, *Für Elise.*\n\n![NOSTALGIA LITE: Lambo VHS Casette Rewinder](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CIZtqss8DW0D39mr0YSK9.png?height=688&width=802)\n\nA moment exists between birth and memory, the weeks, months and years therein shape your identity without your knowing. I call this *the first draft.* The ink that spills between the lines of our lives. Identifying with this record is outside of our waking boundaries; escaping us completely yet rooted in our essence. For the sum of our emotional impressions gathered during *the first draft* remain. Who we are *is what that is*. We spend our lives returning time again in search of. I found myself back home with her.\n\nAir, the space between our thoughts, shaped mathematically is the sound of music. Patterns resulting in harmony, melody, sonic texture and more. The world today is a kaleidoscope of sound; Music Industry revenues are forecasted to grow 84% by 2030. That’s a whole lot of 000s, but let’s get to the point. Why. do. we. do. this? *Für Elise*. I first met her on Christmas day, before I could even remember my own name. This VHS cassette rewinder was shaped like a lambo, and when you rewinded the cassette it would play Für Elise. It became my singularity, like someone turned the lights on.\n\nIn my life, this moment defined me. I’ve even told my friend that this lambo VHS tape rewinder was my personality. It had utility, it had style. It was an instance of culturally significant technology. Most people had the normie VHS cassette rewinder. If you had this lambo VHS tape rewinder, you were for sure one of the lucky ones.\n\n![NINETYONEMGMT Graphics Standard Manual (2017)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kI2Z5gkJ_mddRZjnZ96-t.jpg?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n## Getting Lost\n\nSchool, work, love, fuck. If you’re doing alright, you’d do all four. What happened was that at some point life became vaporware and then things weren’t alright anymore. But they weren’t bad either, they were just.. okay. It happens to the best of us. When you wake up, you just get back on track. I quit my day job and chased the dream. Las Angeles, my only friend. She felt natural and I was too. A one way ticket never hurt nobody. 2017 was the year of the sofa; the same year NINETYONEMGMT was born, too. Explicitly or not, we managed an artist by the name of Riz La Vie and worked out of the SONGS Publishing office in LA to coordinate his one and only hit, Napkins.\n\n![Sunset Boulevard, West Hollywood (2017)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NCUKqmqX_ZgVBJ1AMoi5d.jpeg?height=1050&width=1400)\n\n[Success ensued](https://mega.nz/file/pAkx3ZBC#3tq4Tt0RpVy09C5hy9SsGfALFeII7A3En6riCjaQbps), but we weren’t happy. I got into the business to make massive records with artists I love and holistically champion their estate. Yet somehow, we were not incentives nor values aligned. I had to split. I got into a wreck both [figuratively](https://mega.nz/file/EYNynZCY#4_ecD4Cp967BEDQZFx4W0v1EL0IXOz9Yl-M_fT_etMU) (2019) and [literally](https://mega.nz/file/NFliFTBS#5tq7dYDGSedJPybHBylt7hl5ln8KK7oLVlLGRk1URBE) (2020). Ask anyone close to me and they’ll tell you I am lucky to be alive, or re-alive, or rebirthed. You’re down bad when you fall from heaven and I felt cast away like Lucifer when he fell. Revenge captured me; for the last two years I’ve been working through contempt, feeling loathsome of myself and my situation. I had to remember who I was to forget who I’ve become.\n\n## Rewinding The Cassette\n\nThey say that life is like a movie, but do they mention anything about sequels? Because I’d like to get what’s mine this time. My mind had become like the lambo VHS cassette rewinder. I got back to the music with each rewind. Für Elise, a song dedicated to a muse, a maid or a love interest perhaps; reminds me of a yearning. It’s a bittersweet tune with remnants of euphoria, a fitting synchronization to the movie I had just lived. I need to outgrow myself now and that’s why I’ve got to say goodbye.\n\n![Songwriting Sessions (2017)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V-ibnwOYd055gltwu735e.JPG?height=3024&width=3024)\n\nIt was not without its moments, friends, and memories made. While still I act in full capacity as a talent manager, I no longer operate under this manifestation. NINETYONEMGMT had become Vaporware. Its time under the sun nearing an end. Dreamt up by a headstrong founder and creative, it is responsible for hit records, millions of streams, many dozens of shows, and lives changed. It had fulfilled what the founder had imagined, because at the time of its inception, the founder was very naive. We’ve got new dreams to dream, new songs to sing.\n\n## It’s up to \\*us\\*\\*\n\nMusic. Music. Music. It’s always been about the Music. Remembering who I am and what I was about, that saved me. Music saved me. The first time experience of Für Elise was like my own genesis. Simultaneously, I’ve forgotten who I am and remembered who I was. This is what you call a moment of clarity. The sum of my combined experiences remain, yet my outlook, attitude, and vision are born again. This time I’d like to take it to heights never before imagined.\n\n![Rooftop at Live Nation, West Hollywood (2018)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cWKm3Exim8CTm6q0JLAfu.JPG?height=2726&width=4096)\n\nI borrow a piece of our old lore to explain our new direction:\n\n> “We are vanguards of creation and approach our work with a sense of exaltation and wonder.”\n>\n> \\- *NINETYONEMGMT ETHOS (2017-2022)*\n\nI’ve reached singularity again. Friends, I bid you farewell. I won’t be long, but I won’t be around much either. Now I spill my ink anew, a second draft on the way. I am back home and feeling well. I leave this text in memoriam.

This is a meme project, make no mistake.\n\nCliche time; Merriam Webster defines ‘meme’ as: *an amusing or interesting item (such as a captioned picture or video) or genre of items that is spread widely online especially through social media.*\n\nThat more or less covers it. The internet changed the world. Perhaps the biggest change is that it brought the world a lot closer. It is believed we produce 2.5 QUINTILLION bytes of data per day. That’s like downloading the complete works of Mozart approximately 1/7th the number of times as there are grains of sand on earth. Confusing, right? 4 years in America will have you using anything but the metric system. Accurate? Who’s gonna count and confirm?\n\nAnyway, a lot of this data is being transmitted almost instantaneously over the internet. To put this in perspective, you could send the complete works of Shakespeare to someone as many as 1.75 million times as there are planets in the universe in the time it would take you to send the same to someone without using the internet in any way ONCE. Amazing, innit?\n\nOkay enough jibber jabber. I’ve made my point. A result of this amazing speed of information sharing is being able to discuss stuff in live time. Now when rich Americans decide to buy a popular company with a bird logo, you don’t have to wait till they’ve already started pretending to do ‘due diligence’ in order to drive down the price,Nope…you’ll start seeing jokes about it on that surveillance device you keep within range at all times.\n\nWe know you get your news from meme pages, don’t worry…us too.\n\nMemes have become a crucial part of human society. In fact, I would go as far as to say they are the single most important cultural creation of the 21st century. Memes are borderless, from the 'dee O double G' all the way to a random kid in Southeast Asia who decided to take pictures of himself every day. Memes encompass the entirety of the trippy ass spectrum that is human emotion and deliver it to us in a slightly easier to digest way.\n\nAs Alfred Hitchcock said, “Exposition is a pill that has to be sugar-coated. In other words, you are giving them information, but at the time it must seem like something else. ” ([here’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEq2XjFCaps) a great video on exposition for any film nerds reading this).\n\nThe point is - memes are useful, important, and fun (Oxford comma much?). Memes are here to stay.\n\nThe phenomenon that is the Internet is also what enables the creation of your favorite buzzwords: Metaverse & Cryptocurrency. We are far closer to plugging into the soulless utopia of bright colors and algorithmically generated emotions than you think. Ready? Player One.\n\nThe very ideas of ownership are changing. For the first time, we are exploring the digital realm, being able to do our favorite thing: own stuff. Enter NFTs. The latest descendant in a long line of honeypots originating all the way back to the great Tulip of mid-17th century Netherlands.\n\nThe NFT is possible because of a little something called the Blockchain. You probably know what that is by now. If not, read more man…seriously pick up a phone some time.\n\nAnyway, it is largely agreed that the two major value propositions of the blockchain are decentralization and security. But I believe there are two equally, if not more, important adds are incentivisation and community.\n\nAnyone in the NFT space already knows about the power of community, a bunch of people doing word of mouth marketing for you with vested interest? Hell yeah. And as for incentivization, we’re only beginning to explore that plethora of possibilities. We can create models that allow rewarding people for anything. And I mean…anything([SEXN - a first of it’s kind sex-to-earn protocol](https://twitter.com/mattysino/status/1530215852037050368?s=20&t=oeFix0P1C2Q7Vw2NrrdrUg)). Yeah…everything is going to zero.\n\n(All these things combined are what we call Web3.)\n\nBUUUUUT, in case it’s not, we think the meme itself should find a way into this “Web3” too. In a manner that’s keeping up with the times. *And that is what NotLuna is all about.*\n\nNow that you know the “Why?”, let’s talk about the “What?”.\n\nNotLuna is a collection of 10,000 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. NotLuna is NOT, in any way, a reference to one of the best memes in history. It does NOT take inspiration from perhaps what is one of the greatest stories of human hubris.\n\nBut you know what they say: comedy is tragedy plus time…and we’re laughing about it already.\n\nNo, NotLuna is about a person, just like all of us.\n\nMeet Do Gen:\n\n![Do Gen](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WLaJ-Za_GlDVG71d3jQUn.png?height=1000&width=1000)\n\nJust like all of us, he’s trying to make it in Web3 too. And just like all of us, he goes through many emotions.\n\nDo was born in NotSeoul in a time well before Web3. But technology always spoke to him. In fact, he even studied at the prestigious NotStanford community and then went on to work for behemoths like NotApple and NotMicrosoft. But it was in the blockchain that he found his calling.\n\nNow he spends his days trying to find the next big thing and when he has time from that, he tries to create something of his own. Oh and he loves to water his plants, whatever that’s about.\n\nJoin Do on this emotional roller coaster that is the decentralized internet.\n\nGMI or NGMI? Only one way to find out. (mint it)\n\n## FAQs\n\n* Wen mint?\n\nNot sure yet, but super soon.\n\n* Free, right?\n\nYeah yeah. Y’all been conned one too many times for us to be able to charge you for this. But we’re keeping 1000 and we don’t need to explain why.\n\n* Roadmap?\n\nYeah, as if you read roadmaps…you’re in it for the vibes and so are we.\n\n* Really, nothing planned?\n\nNot per se, but some people believe that when Do Gen was born, a mystic made a prophecy that if Do Gen’s collection reached a 1E floor, he would find his wife Di Gen and together they would create an army of De Gens. So we’ll see.\n\n* Who are you?\n\nAh yes, the team. Another metric you pretend to look at before “aping in”.\n\nThe writer of this paper is @cryptanosaurus. I have been degening on the blockchain for about 6 years now and am now building something pretty cool (shameless plugin). Check it out here: [https://novadao.xyz/#/](https://novadao.xyz#/)\n\nOh and the mint link will be released in Nova’s discord so you probably want to hop in there.\n\nAnd the Co-Founder, Archie, is an artist and architect. He has been in charge of bringing these traits to life.\n\nThe funny thing is, Archie and I have never met in real life. We met each other through the mutual ownership of the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO. Maybe NFTs do have some promise after all. They bring people together .\n\nYou can suss us out on Twitter, we’re legit (like legit enough for you to take a free NFT from us).\n\n* Hey these faces look familiar…what’s that about?\n\nIf these expressions ring a bell, you’re old enough to stop wasting time on random mints and get a real job. Ur old and ur poor and ur still wasting time on memes. But yeah, we felt a great way to begin the Web3 meme journey is with an ode to the first memes. Sit and think of new stuff and not just remake old shit combined with a topical element? Bitch Please!!\n\nSee you soon, my fellow ~~De Gens~~  Do Gens!!\n\n![The Many Moods of Do](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iCly51yygBTV9xsrm2Nhb.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654528699, "digest": "UX5AzHVKO17pD2KmIfcodkiFkE8-CtlOnQps5KMAIhk", "contributor": "0x93FC0C711c2dF516Bc442AD4B3Ed47Cc4001829B"}
{"id": "7kpJ9ABVrW8Zy7ZqfQ--u70ULgiFSbb3L5Mr4f5mq7k", "title": "The Many Voices of Jim Goldberg", "body": "**By [Gregory Eddi Jones](https://twitter.com/EddiJonesNFT)**\n\n![Whirlpool #45 Mad Dog's Auntie by Jim Goldberg.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kAOOHXrib-EbAzfE9axq0.jpg?height=768&width=1024&size=large)\n\nThe photographer Jim Goldberg is well-known for his expansive toolbox of storytelling techniques, and his work is often heralded for new innovations in the documentary tradition. Goldberg often trains his lens on the types of subjects that other photographers ignore, and his work frequently dispels the misconceptions of people on the fringes of mainstream society. All the while, the photographer speaks in various visual voices in a multi-faceted form of storytelling that acknowledges the complexities of his subject matter. It is with these practices that Goldberg presents his latest body of work, *Whirlpool*.\n\n![Whirlpool #40 Harry Saul Minnow Farm by Jim Goldberg. Obscura Magnum Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pWC_5IRRvtJcUxZuktAcM.jpg?height=1024&width=768&size=medium)\n\n*Whirlpool* is an extension of a larger project that Goldberg was originally commissioned to create for Atlanta’s High Museum of Art from a series of grants that urged photographers to explore the culture of the American South. The project brought him to Arkansas, a place where few photographers seem to venture in their quests for stories about American life. Goldberg’s work there culminated in a 30-ft wide black and white photo collage about the lives surrounding the Arkansas Delta that was exhibited at the High Museum, and which featured prints collaged together with words from the many different voices of people he encountered in his venture.\n\n![Whirlpool #31 James by Jim Goldberg. Obscura Magnum Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FRD9aAZKA4TM2Eu6tq1Rz.jpg?height=677&width=1024&size=large)\n\nFor his Obscura commission, Goldberg revisited Arkansas and, over the course of two weeks in February, produced a new series of images in Augusta, a small, working-class city that has faced a long and slow economic decline since the late 19th century. The photographer’s interests centered on local communities from church groups to boxing clubs, as he sought to unearth the richness of history, family, and culture while being attuned to the complex relationships the place has to struggling economics and attitudes toward race and class.\n\n![Whirlpool #15 Camella and Cortnie by Jim Goldberg. Obscura Magnum Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8YBIK1F5NBBOG8exBcs58.jpg?height=819&width=1024&size=large)\n\nThroughout the 55 images of this collection, Goldberg takes us on a tour through Augusta. Portraits introduce us to its inhabitants, often accompanied by hand-written scrawls from the subjects themselves that allow them to tell fragments of their own stories. This follows in Goldberg’s decades-long commitment to eschew the typical dictatorial role that a photographer plays in defining their subjects, providing space for co-authorship to enrich the notion of storytelling through collaborative processes.\n\n![Whirlpool #8 Kensea by Jim Goldberg. Obscura Magnum Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MvfDBPb6EwxRkvyfqVmn4.jpg?height=1024&width=832&size=medium)\n\n*Whirlpool* itself represents a cacophony of visual voices which range from strict, cold B&W renderings to colorful and emotionally warm portrayals of the city’s populace. In the photographs of Whirlpool we encounter pictures that speak with airy romance, but also crude realism. Pictures compete with one another for a supremacy of definition in the emotional, factual, and interpersonal perspectives that visitors may bring to this city with them.\n\n![Whirlpool #10 Hunting Lodge by Jim Goldberg. Obscura Magnum Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BtNEtMG_ewJSTQ9uxJ_D6.jpg?height=768&width=1024&size=large)\n\nWhile many photographers subscribe to the narrowly confined styles to illustrate purposefulness in their pictures, Goldberg’s practice reflects the complexity of his subject matter, and the hybridized image-forms that represent this project nod to the notion that documentary should not be conducted in a single voice, flattened by a particular aesthetic definition, but rather opened widely to demonstrate the contradictions that exist within any given place and within any given person as well. In sum, *Whirlpool* presents an orchestra of conflicting voices that reflect perhaps not what Jim Goldberg himself found in the town, but the biases and assumptions that we as viewers would likely bring had we gone there ourselves. \n\n![Whirlpool #22 Berry Pie by Jim Goldberg.

{"id": "aK8iv2TXw-TRqZim1JLD8yPOjqdCQ907Jr7kRDprKUI", "title": "Living in Perpetual Violence", "body": "I live in a country completely engrossed in violence. I’m blessed enough to not have violence in my personal environment, but every time I leave the house, I anticipate that I could enter any plethora of violent scenarios.\n\n**We must begin to ask ourselves what living in perpetual violence does to our mental health**, how ongoing trauma impacts our well being.\n\nWe can turn to overt violent environments, like the war in Ukraine, and see what happens to the human spirit under the ongoing campaign of senseless violence. For some, the spirit rises up and fights back. For others, the spirit retracts in self defense. In all, the spirit frays under the constant duress of heartbreaking and senseless death.\n\nWe can’t deny the scale of tragedy in Ukraine right now. I can only imagine what living through such destruction would do to one’s heart. But what I’m exploring in this essay is a more subtle and ongoing war against one another. The violence we allow and inflict upon one another, in a country not at “war” is a stunning and devastating reflection of who we are as a society.\n\n**The fact that we Americans allow, ALLOW, gun lobbyists to buy and sell our children’s futures so they can reap gross profits on the fear instilled in a population obsessed with violence is stunning. And devastating.** The fact that 90% of the country want sensible gun laws, and I would guess at this point many want to eradicate guns completely, yet 50 old, privileged, white senators in DC want to protect their donors is also a stunning indictment on the reality we’ve created as a country. Which leaves the rest of us to watch in a helpless horror as our communities become target practice for young male racists with serious mental disorders. Every week. Hell, almost every day.\n\nI am constantly appalled at the country I call home. I constantly plot ways to live overseas and not miss my family in a way that makes want to return to this hell hole. Every time I get out of my car to enter the grocery store, I grab my cell phone and make a conscious decision to bring it with me in case I end up in a mass casualty event and have a few seconds to call my family and tell them goodbye. Every time I sit at a coffeeshop and write, which is daily, I scan the door often to see if some angry white Incel is going to enter and shoot the place up. I returned to university this year and I often wonder, while sitting in a classroom, if some angry, broken white male will enter the room and start shooting and I begin to scan for the exits and hiding places.\n\n> Why do we live like this? Why do we allow politicians to do absolutely nothing but vote against the safety and security of the people they are charged with voting on behalf of? Is the shopping really that good? Is the entertainment culture really that satisfying?\n>\n> **Are the distractions from reality so beneficial that we allow our children to take the bullets that our politicians are too weak to stop?**\n>\n> Are we really that broken that we can’t see what guns and polarization are doing to this country? Are we really so blind that we can not and WILL NOT protect the children we love so dearly? Are we really so tired, broke and exhausted that we’re OK with allowing less than a third of this country, filled with ignorance, hatred and violence, to attack our children, women, BIPOC and LGBTQ communities each and every day and deny us our inalienable rights to simply live and breathe the same as them?\n\nI’ve learned many new tools in my yogic and Buddhadharma studies this past year at school. I’ve learned to live with an open heart, which makes living in such a country so much harder. And to be clear, I’ve visited and worked in some of the most violent countries in the world and never felt the anxiety of random violence like I do in America. I’ve learned to lean into the pain and anger and find the lessons so they don’t consume my thoughts and actions. I’ve also learned to hold space for duality.\n\nThe duality of living in such a violent country yet also seeing the beauty of such a place as America is the thing I am struggling with one day after 19 children were murdered by a crazed gunman while learning arithmetic and giggling with their classmates. **Holding space for both the reality of this place and the beauty of this place is getting harder by the day.**\n\nAnd if we’re being honest here, the next six months will determine just how much duality we can all hold without breaking. If we don’t restore sanity to this country and protect our children, our women and our elders from the desires of a handful of old ass white men and women in DC with ulterior motives they no longer bother hiding, then I fear our ability to hold that duality will be shattered.\n\nAnd some of us will have to leave to preserve our mental well being. Is it too much to ask to simply want to enjoy public gathering spaces with lovely humans and share the communal act of breaking bread and meaningful conversation without the haunting specter of random violence lurking in the shadows of every moment? I don’t believe it is. I know other countries don’t live this way and are looking at us in absolute horror at what we permit to happen in our communal gathering spaces each and every day.\n\n**We must take a long hard look at who we are and who we, as a country, wish to become.**\n\nWe can vote, we can protest, we can scream into the void until we can scream no more, but at the end of the day, such a systemic change as what’s needed now will take more than what the everyday person can accomplish. We need the DOJ to actually enforce the law and begin prosecuting politicians and citizens who committed treason on January 6th. We need accountability for those in power or those who were in power and openly abused it to try and steal elections and rig our voting system. We need celebrities and leaders with platforms and access to the masses, those who have cultivated massive followings of people, to speak out right now.\n\n#### Use your platforms, take the microphone and DEMAND that the leaders of this country change. Now. For I fear very soon it will be too late.\n\n[edition://0x859Dd1640FD30FDB64f0c54082f745a100768E8d?editionId=0](edition://0x859Dd1640FD30FDB64f0c54082f745a100768E8d?editionId=0)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654528689, "digest": "ewg-LW63vhkKxlxopUTjjOwdn-Z-VYgnzaJpYobAGv8", "contributor": "0x1ba3ef24bc64B22a80422678d4B6Ea85f0f92Bde"}

this game\nGuest：罡哥（ATTM公会CEO） William（ATTM公会CMO）\n\n# 二 分享内容-罡哥、William\n\n（Era7游戏内容，亮点，策略等）\n\n我们游戏公会是从AXIE爆火后开始做奖学金计划，在去年很多游戏不管是AXIE,飞船都会遇到死亡螺旋，玩家失去了信心，导致币价下跌。我觉得如果去年是Gamefi1.0的话，今年应该Gamefi2.0。\n\n所以我觉得接下来的游戏会开始做所谓的电竞，会把挖提卖，或者赚钱这件事情focus在高手玩家，但是新玩家也有机会进来争取世界第一或者前10%，也有机会赚到钱。\n\n当初我们在官方接洽的时候是透过币安帮我们引荐的。那个时候我协助他们推广，和项目方直接沟通的时候项目方一直反复强调，想要做走长线的游戏，之后在电竞方面想要很深入地去发展。\n\n来介绍下Era7，卡牌一共共有七个种族，每个种族有四个稀有度，稀有度会影响到卡牌的实力。我是比较建议从稀有入场，所以入场成本可能大概在150busd，假如想要冲排行榜，赚取更高额的奖金，那比较适合史诗卡牌。另外卡牌有power值，指的是可以召唤多少张卡，那如果想要增加召唤次数就会需要去消耗实用代币GOT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QWtPplREgnfj_d2AVNXfy.png?height=942&width=1350)\n\n## 我觉得Era7的几个亮点：\n\n首先美术风格我自己觉得不错的，当然美术风格见仁见智，我自己蛮喜欢这样的风格；\n\n项目方更新比较积极，执行效率不错，游戏刚开始只有英文版本，然后我们跟官方聊对于华人区的玩家不是很友善，他们收到这个消息一个礼拜以后，就有中文了；\n\n第三是卡牌的深度很够。如果你要建立新的卡组，需要放30张卡片，就会导致有很多策略性。因为我自己以前也有玩炉石打上传说过，在大概五六年前，所以我认为游戏的策略性实并不输当时的炉石，不敢说和现在的炉石比，era7一定还有很多进步空间，但我认为卡牌的配合深度是蛮充足的。\n\n## 游戏玩法介绍：\n\n这个游戏它是一个九宫格的站位，一开始给四张牌，可以替换费高的卡牌，如果看到卡牌费不够，可以charge丢弃一张卡换到多一点费。那这回合费值就会到3。在上路中路下路摆放我的卡牌，当同一排对面没有任何卡的时候，就会直接去攻击对方，当对方玩家生命值归零的话，这场对决就胜利了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4DBQ8q27supB7ZW-AmFvj.png?height=705&width=1350)\n\n这个游戏逻辑是以上的内容，其中还会涉及到卡牌的搭配，我的卡牌比较倾向于打快攻，我就加强自己的攻击力，一直去打他的脸。\n\nPlay to earn的奖励在Ranking这里，如果赢一场大概获得2个got，另外如果打到排行榜，还有周奖励和赛季奖励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/llAreBrp7SoyeTHPBA2lt.png?height=714&width=1350)\n\n那玩家是不是氪金越强花很多钱就有可能第一名或者是前三名，这个游戏它比较特殊的地方，就是说他的卡牌呢，调配不错。比如一个大佬花了10万块去建构牌组达到了第一，也有可能只花了4万块达到了前3，我们群里有一个前排玩家上一季也是第一名，整个牌子只花了2万块人民币，所以这个游戏并不是很多钱就会特别强，如果牌组搭配的不好也不一定能够赢，像上次看到算力3600分的跟我打，也输给我。这代表说他的牌组配置有问题，我的配置比较好或者运气比较好，这些在这个游戏上面都是有可能的。\n\n另外卡牌还可以自动挖矿，比如我的算力是13000，每一天大概拿到20个左右代币，这部分的收益比较少，大部分收益还是玩游戏，拼到比较高的报酬。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZOMj8N4KehnuZ-XBHDQ8L.png?height=698&width=1350)\n\n## 代币的消耗\n\n目前游戏的代币是💲GOT和💲ERA（治理代币）\n\n💲GOT代币消耗：之前提到的卡牌召唤；另外是卡牌合成，每张battle card卡片会有四个level，如果要把卡升到level4，要消耗💲GOT，还有8张卡牌，这个消耗就很大。那因为这是传说卡消耗的就会更多，假如这个是史诗卡，它消耗的代币就会比传说卡的小。\n\n## 投资策略\n\n目前投资游戏的策略我们会购买一部分的治理代币，另外我们会把大部分的钱在打排行榜上。我们之前算过，大约1.5-2个月回本。但我们奖学金模式不会像去年做AXIE infinity一样，当时找了非常多菲律宾玩家大概四五百人，做一样的事情，用一样的队伍；在这款游戏上会挑选比较好的玩家，我们上一周和这一周也举办比赛，认识了非常多高手玩家，邀请他们来公会参与奖学金，我们出钱再分润给他，如果玩家非常会玩，就可以打到比较高额的报酬。\n\n这是我们目前认为游戏的一些亮点，还有目前我们公会做的一些投资策略。\n\n## 对于后续电竞方面的看法\n\n回想一下英雄联盟，我大一时台湾有一个英雄联盟的队伍叫台北暗杀星，那时候我在宿舍看台北暗杀星打败韩国队伍，拿到冠军，一个电竞队伍可以到世界舞台，对我来说很感动。我自己觉得电竞这几年发展不像前几年那么兴盛，可能和整个商业、产业有蛮大关系。因为它是非常庞大的组织，如果要办一个比赛，要花费非常多金钱。一个游戏公司要组织战队，要招揽选手，还要养选手，可能一年要几百万几千万美金。游戏选手如果拿到了大赛奖金，要先从游戏公司开始分，还有一些行销，可能100万的奖金只分到20万，相信这是很多电竞选手会遇到的问题。\n\n我觉得WEB3的电竞比较去中心化，比如我在台湾在一个很小的城市，英雄联盟打得再好，没有人会关注到，也没有人给我所谓的电竞奖金。但在WEB3的机会可能崭露头脚，更甚至我可以靠打游戏过活，我可以玩很多游戏，在上面打排行榜可以赚钱。我们在ATTM在上个月也举报era7比赛，报名人数150，实际比赛人数有大约80个。对我们来说举办比赛是一个蛮大的挑战，基本上都是自愿的玩家志愿者来帮忙。\n\n我们也和官方联系，他们确实会在电竞或者说竞技这一块琢磨，后面开发自己的赛事平台。因为我们这次比赛有一个游戏里面的酒馆可以对战，后面官方也会出自己的赛事，至于怎么让玩家在上面比赛可以等官方发布消息。\n\n去年的游戏公会倾向于不管是YGG或者GGG游戏大公会，在Axie爆火时候进行一些募资，我看他们简报基本上都在讲他们的scholar有多少人，比如说YGG好像有4万多名玩p2e，但是我觉得今年可能不是人数谁多谁厉害，游戏公会更专业化、精准化一点会有更多一些机会。今年大部分复制化的挖提卖游戏很容易被淘汰掉，就像AXIE，还有最近的stepn太容易被复制了，就是我天是一个不太走路的人和很会走路的人，我们如果买的鞋子是一样的，我们赚到的钱是一样的，我认为gamefi脱离这样能够复制的模式，才能让真正的玩家去赚到这些钱。\n\n但我认为在WEB3的世界确实还非常早期，我不敢说未来怎么样，很多游戏还没有办法对自己的token有很大的共识度，资产还不够去中心化。像猴子是非常去中心化的资产，大部分链游现在也是相当中心化的。那如果能办电竞，引入外部的更大更多的资金去举办实体的电竞比赛，跟实体去结合，才有可能有更大的发展，如果单纯纯走虚拟的，可能硬核度不是很够。\n\n# 三 自由讨论-GMA社区玩家\n\n**（培才总）**\n\n我在想一个困扰我很久的问题，链游怎么样才能成功？因为我们投资链游最核心的就是怎么样找到有价值的链游。今天听了一个播客，里面提了一个观点还挺有启发。传统应用和WEB3D应用的核心区别是什么？想要成功一定要迎合某种价值主张或者达成用户的某种需求。那**链游和传统游戏相比到底迎合了用户的哪些价值主张？换句话说，用户哪些需求是在传统游戏没有被满足的？**\n\n从这个角度来考虑非常有价值的，很多人会把元宇宙也从两个角度里去理解，一部分希望元宇宙给身临其境的体验，在区块链里就叫可玩性派，希望链游有足够的可玩性。还有一派会把元宇宙理解为加密资产派，不仅仅是画面也希望里面像真实的世界有真实价值，主价值的的资产，有一些智能合约。回到链游可能也要从这两个角度，**链游能不能提供有价值的资产，第二个能不能提供有价值的信息。**\n\n那么所谓的信息就是指可玩性，传统游戏里面或者前面两位嘉宾介绍卡牌游戏的可玩性，画风，美术。但是在WEB3应用里面用户的优先级比较高的是资产其次是信息。这可能有点儿对应比特币，没什么可玩性但提供了非常有价值的资产，比特币可以把它理解为第一个web3应用，或者第一个区块链游戏，但基本上没什么可玩性。以太访我觉得在比特的基础上强化了可玩性，但是资产性要稍微弱一点，他牺牲了去中心化的程度，牺牲了一些资产的安全性。gamefi我觉得是在以太坊基础上更一轮的升级，他们发展的顺序，也是先有btc后有eth，然后才有区块链游戏。区块链游戏里面也不能脱离资产，虽然资产肯定没有比特币这么硬，但是也不能像传统游戏里的金币那么软。\n\n如果一个好的区块链游戏，能不能提供一些比较硬的资产？拿era7为例，里面最硬的资产是token，\\*\\*那token的硬度、价值来源是值得我们思考的问题。\\*\\*我们前面玩过很多资产硬度上做的不好，股权代币分发的方式说改就改，分发过程也非常不公平，项目方甚至全一级的投资者机构拿了大量廉价筹码，导致大家慢慢对项目丧失了信心，也就慢慢倒闭了。另外资产的价值也来自可玩性，就像以太坊有一定的功能性，但功能性和安全性是强相关的，以太坊的核心价值是上面长出了各种各样的应用和其他资产，在用以太坊体系的时候就自动要消耗gas，这部分系统的收入分发给了以太坊持有者。\n\n另外猴子也在讲元宇宙或者游戏的概念，他的做法非常聪明，虽然还没有任何游戏性，但已经创造了非常庞大的资产：无聊猿+变异猿+土地+ape coin资产的总规模已经有几百亿美金了。而且猴的fpf价值是可以脱离游戏存在的，没有游戏也会把它拿来做头像，也就是说游戏有了一部分共识的赋能。这个也是非常棒的做法，也是很多区块链的游戏应该学习的地方，能不能有一部分资产可以脱离体系存在，era7的token现在离不开游戏，如果游戏如果比如说项目上不开发了，没人玩了，那相信这个资产会归零，但是猴子可能就游戏有没有成功会影响头像的价值，但是头像本身就已经很有价值，甚至没有游戏依然还有价值，这是很厉害的。\n\n刚好在链游底层逻辑上的一些思考，趁这个机会给大家分享，希望收到大家的反馈，era7持有代币的价值在哪？\n\n**（罡哥）**\n\n目前代币的问题不论是got和era都通过生成卡，合成卡去做消耗。前几个礼拜成立了dao，就是持有多少era可以参加投票。炉石官方自己有评估的卡牌太强或太弱，官方可能就会在下一个赛季去削弱或加强。era有做一个dao，质押后获得ve，这些票可以用来投票做更动，不管是加强还是削弱让大家来决定。我觉得这个可能在传统游戏是没办法看到的，也是蛮特别的部分。\n\n我们公会其实有接触到不同的游戏，目前我们认为比较好玩的游戏偏卡牌，也归根于开发区块链游戏的厂商可能大部分还不够给力，没有真正的MMORPG游戏出来，那我们也有接触到其他的游戏，然后目前来说确实是培才总刚才说的token都focus在游戏应用里，目前确实比较少用途。\n\n`（培才总）`\n\n我觉得这个挺有意思，刚才想了想一般链游里面资产的种类分为：token和NFT。\n\n赋能主要是游戏内和游戏外赋能，但是很多链游游戏外的赋能是不够的，如果游戏性又不好，很多链游就衰亡了。游戏本身没可玩性，代币的价值就主要是来自于游戏内，就形成了恶性循环。\n\n**1）游戏外的赋能方式：**\n\n什么是资产的游戏外的赋能呢？以token为例，**defi是一个比较好的游戏外赋能的方式**，它有点像btc的挖矿，代币的获取是有成本的，要么提供流动性承担了无常损失，要么拿其他交易对去换代币，至少是有成本的，前阵子ama时候说tiny砍了一池其实未必是个好事。我觉得链游在这么早期的阶段，游戏性不能很好给代币赋能的时候，采用游戏外的赋能也蛮有价值的。\n\n还有一个是通过社交媒体给NFT资产赋能。比较好的例子就是猴子，通过把NFT资产在社交媒体上炒热，也会形成一部分的共识价值。这部分共识价值虽然还不知道是不是有泡沫，但确实是一个方式，来给资产做游戏外的赋能。\n\n广告也是一个点，和刚才嘉宾说的电子竞技一样，电竞某种程度上有一定广告价值，不仅电竞，所有的体育比赛都是这样，体育比赛从来不是让参赛队伍出钱的，而是卖转播权收广告费，然后把收到的钱分一部分给电竞选手。但我觉得电竞和IP这个会不会早期不太好走，至少电竞你得有一定的影响力，广告商才愿意付费，IP可能会稍微容易些，猴子算是一个特例吧。\n\n**2）游戏内的赋能方式：**\n\n比较常见是通过榜单的模式，还有在新人的进入、在游戏的收入环节，把一部分利润烧掉或者放到社区金库里面，或者回购代币项目。可能游戏内赋能就是几种方式吧，有一些真金白银的收入，直接分红或者是销毁，或者买了token质押在那儿，就直接通过合约的形式分红给大家，mobox主要是通过销毁的形式，会在交易市场收到的手续费去销毁；另外鼓励大家锁流动性，锁一定期限，就给更多的奖励。\n\n（Adam）\n\n因为我本身也是era7游戏玩家，对卡牌稍微了解。我认为对于WEB3游戏web2的区别在于：WEB3最初期就要把自己想象成一个经济体。经济体像国家一样需要人口支撑，就是新的流量进来，新的流量会带着钱去购买NFT资产，然后通过一些操作得到了游戏代币，代币带来经济效应可能又吸引了一部分新的用户进来。\n\n这里我觉得就分成两个线：资产派和信息派。信息派其实更偏web2，互联网是打破信息壁垒，web3主要是做了资产所属权的固定。那在这个游戏里，我认为主要是把自己的经济体做大，从另外一个角度来讲，游戏本身的世界观如果足够大，做游戏内资产发行的多样性就会比较多，营销的手段就会比较多。这也是前面提到像用社交媒体去做一些不同类型NFT资产发行，用户投钱进来之后想办法把形成文化共识固定在这儿。第二种就是在token的应用层面上，除了前面提到的defi挂钩相关的，跟本身游戏奖励相关的，还有era7后面的七大种族、涉及到nft地皮，资产增值的方式。其他新的玩法也可能会涉及到，比如说类似发展成BNB的类似于平台币的感觉。然后罡哥提到如果做线下的电竞赛事，游戏代币本身也可以配合NFT资产作为赛事的门槛，或者所谓参赛的条件、观赏的条件。\n\n另外我也想讨论的是gamefi从最开始的页游，慢慢有一些制作精良的游戏，到后面的3a大作。像TCP卡牌类游戏有点类似于轻竞技，一局3分钟，但是长流非常好留存率很好，对设备的要求很低。现在很多大的公司都在冲3a，也要考虑到对设备的要求会不会导致我们想转化的流量根本进不来，这是关于流量层面的一个点。在流量对接层面上，公会的账户NFT租赁体系在游戏是很重要的，因为web3用户进来时候就是投资人+用户，玩着玩着产生分歧，要么觉得游戏不好玩儿抛币走人，要么觉得游戏可能会火持续投入，但持续投入到一定程度之后，会觉得在游戏赚钱和投钱差距太大就变成了投资人，那他游戏活跃度就下降。所以这时候NFT可能租赁体系，就会相对而言就会降低进来的门槛，让投资人更专注做NFT的流动性，做投资，打游戏的专注于打游戏。\n\n**（培才总）**\n\n我也认可，目前我觉得有一个发展路径的问题是资产和信息是相互促成的循环，要么是正反馈，要么是负反馈。像3a的游戏有一个问题：信息性能不能给资产赋能，如果游戏品质很好，又有非常好的机制给游戏内的资产赋能，确实会比较好。比如原来传统游戏能不能直接通过链改，目前只能看到一个实例就是传奇4的可玩性是不错的，也是对得起3a的名号，我觉得传奇4的问题是没有很好给游戏内的资产赋能。\n\n还没有用到区块链技术，比如CSGO和梦幻西游，里面确实是有一些有价值的资产的，那这部分资产的价值可能来自于通过信息性赋能资产性的一个终局，里面有一些皮肤是很贵的，因为开箱子机制，或者有几十万的玩家，就造成虽然没有运用区块链基础也没有token，但是里面的资产也可以炒的很贵。可以用信息游戏性来给游戏内的资产赋能。\n\n我不知道现在区块链游戏能不能直接走到这一步，因为这两个游戏也是通过早期的积累，这条路恐怕不太好走，游戏内的资产的价值来源全是来自于游戏或者信息性的话，其实还是挺难的。\n\n**（唐旻）**\n\n其实要赋能非常简单，我以前做过端游的，**在我看来WEB3游戏和WEB2的游戏其实本质上核心的东西就是经济系统**。大部分游戏在开服的时候的代币是价值最高的，随着游戏逐步进展，金币源源不断生产出来，金币必然是贬值的。达到一定程度以后会维持在相对稳定的状态，但是长久以来肯定是缓慢下跌的。 端游里面很考验的经济系统和现在WEB3的一样，因为WEB3所有代币都是慢慢产出，必然会缓慢下跌，而且不像端游可以通过新服来操作，代币算是价值初始化，就像那重启web3没法做到这样的机制代币体系必然会缓慢下降，因为总量一定在增加，除非有不停的新用户增量进来，但是新用户迟早也会有瓶颈。\n\nWEB3比web2的优势是没有游戏厂商在抽血。以前免费游戏的金币是承受双重抽血的：一个是缓慢蒸发，还有一个是游戏厂商拿到了大头。如果游戏厂商把拿走的钱还回到游戏里，做一个更好的不通胀的经济体系，在以前的端游时代应该是可以做到的。\n\n我觉得WEB3以后是把游戏厂商在以前免费玩时，卖免费道具这中代币赋能的形式回馈到游戏。比如说游戏厂商来卖免费道具的，比如说像炉石是游戏厂商来卖，抽掉很大一部分，我如实适用我炉石里面的代币来开卡，那等于是把暴雪的收益全部注回到游戏。我觉得这是游戏里面最强大的赋能形式，其他的赋能都免不了庞氏的结局。我觉得WEB3的模式就是游戏厂商不再从游戏里面吸血，大家都能从里面去获利。\n\n回到这款游戏era7，比如要我来设计给他赋能，像欢乐豆是纯产出的，但欢乐豆是有价值的，就是在游戏中消耗，比如era7的游戏设计房间，代币要像欢乐豆那样带进去的，那它的消耗就滚起来了，然后游戏代币一部分给持有者，一部分给厂商，让它源源不断的消耗，代币还是要回归到游戏里面。以前端游时代本来确实是有价值的，但是它本来应该承受的价值很大一部分被游戏厂商拿走了。它里面的经济体系很容易崩盘。WEB3阶段的游戏厂商刚开始NFT发售会拿走一部分，但游戏厂商应该把这部分回归游戏，让游戏代币来承受免费道具的发放，形成一个循环。\n\n**备注：GMA的内容只做参考，不构成投资建议，投资需谨慎，大家量力而行，谢谢。**\n\n\n---\n\n#

{"id": "ePyjRSvrkw3CgR7uQ1TrdENi18xkqYJObKthgeEgbk0", "title": "NFT 交易平台：蓝海 or 红海市场？", "body": "## Key Takeaway\n\n* 蓝海市场是一种新兴市场，利润率高，不存在恶性竞争；而红海市场是已知且竞争激烈的市场，有着较高的壁垒和严格的行业竞争规则。\n* 在大小形态各异的市场间，有些市场能够为交易双方带来创新价值，有些市场只是单纯复刻其他市场的创收模式。\n* 一些使用 Token 的平台通过激励设计为用户提供新价值，如 LooksRare，Magic Eden。\n* 2022年5月16日，Magic Eden 每日交易量为 4722 万美元，而 OpenSea 的交易量为 3288 万美元，ME日活跃用户数量也已有超越 OS 的趋势。\n* 随着OpenSea添加对SOL的支持，跨链和全链 NFT 市场或许是未来趋势之一。根据 Magic Eden 的数据，OpenSea 上的 Solana NFT 销售额约为 Magic Eden 推出以来的 9%。\n* 在NFT二级市场和衍生交易成熟下，NFT 交易市场需要重新思考 NFT 指数交易，碎片化交易和衍生交易的方式和用户体验。\n\n蓝海战略（Blue Ocean Strategy）这一概念最早由金伟灿（W. Chan Kim）和勒妮·莫博涅（Renée Mauborgne）共同提出，指的是企业主动开拓新兴且尚无竞争的市场。该战略不着眼于细分市场、满足用户偏好，而是通过改变产业，重设游戏规则，合并细分市场、整合需求达到价值创新 。而红海（Red Ocean）则相反，市场中人人都是竞争对手，市场之间有着森严的壁垒。\n\n早期NFT市场是一种蓝海市场。随着NFT交易平台OpenSea的上线，NFT市场如雨后春笋一般迅速发展壮大。起初，OpenSea在整个NFT交易领域并不存在任何竞争者，但随着SuperRare和Nifty Gateway等新交易平台入场，竞争的序幕正式拉开。\n\n过去几个月中，X2Y2、LooksRare和Coinbase NFT等新交易平台不断涌现，二级市场逐渐呈现饱和态势，这也就是我们上文中提到的——红海：市场拥挤，增长动力缺乏，利润率持续走低，最终走向白热化竞争。换句话说，红海意味着项目方间的利益抢夺之战。狼多肉少，所以推动创新和找准市场定位，将会是取胜的关键。\n\n## 市场价值\n\n随着新兴竞争者进入市场，很多项目方开始谋求价值创新，追寻开源节流的发展模式。现有市场之间界限分明，用户需要哪种服务，哪种类型的市场便应运而生。打个比方，一些投资者更偏好独具艺术性的小众NFT和1/1艺术类作品，Foundation或Nifty Gateway这样出售独特NFT作品的交易市场就满足了这部分用户的需求。\n\n![价值创新模型（Value Innovation Model）；数据来源：NFTGo.io，蓝海战略](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7gMNvlRvtpML2Euj-XU9V.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n尽管已有大量提供NFT交易服务的平台，项目方们仍在追求给用户带来新的交互体验。最近新上线的Coinbase NFT就是其中一个例子，该平台在原有交易网站的基础上新增了社交功能，方便用户在NFT界面内留言，分享NFT投资方面的经验。\n\n通过Pioneer Migrator Map，我们可以轻易分辨出，哪些网站是在为用户创造价值、提升用户使用体验，哪些网站可能只是在复刻原有的运营模式。\n\n![Pioneer Migrator Map；数据来源：NFTGo.io，蓝海战略](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZrbHEsxLN4sx3P14EwPNP.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n提供NFT交易服务的平台有很多，但这些平台的整体运营战略是趋同的。我们可以通过市场价值评估图（Market Evaluation）来衡量不同平台的核心竞争力，下图y轴表示了各平台在不同竞争力因素上的表现，除了图上显示的几个指标外，我们还新增了“成本结构”、“多链聚合”、“复杂性操作”几个指标，y轴上的得分越高，该平台为交易双方带来的价值就越多，反之，得分越少，其创造的价值也就越少。\n\n![市场价值评估图；数据来源：NFTGo.io，蓝海战略](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OgI13zPxFd1m-BFktQNWa.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n尽管用户在不同平台之间享受的服务是类似的，但在所有NFT交易平台中，OpenSea仍是当之无愧的头部项目。随着越来越多交易平台的推出，可以预见的是，未来几年内的市场价值评估图上的数据折线势必会愈发密集。如今从NFT交易中创造新价值，也将会成为平台开发者需要思考的问题。\n\n## **谁才是领头羊？**\n\n能否创造价值，是交易平台在长期竞争中胜出的关键因素。市场总销售额（Marketplaces Total Sales）与市场价值评估图是衡量价值的关键指标，平台为用户提供的价值越多，通过该平台达成的交易额也就越多。在下图中，我们可以看到5个顶级交易平台的销售总额数据（LooksRare的数据统计去除了“清洗交易”和“最高销售额”）。\n\n![市场总销售额；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MBpQIYNy_yJQY9zJnk5sJ.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nLooksRare上线后，得益于其为用户带来的新价值，迅速占据了不小的市场份额，发展成为以太坊第二大NFT交易平台。\n\n![市场份额占有率（Market Dominance）；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6EYJkjlEslVzxXGmrzpmH.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n抛开OpenSea这个庞然大物不谈，我们不难发现，由于Rarible、Foundation和SuperRare这三家交易平台为用户提供的服务较为相似，平台间的竞争也较为激烈。\n\n![市场总销售额（除OpenSea）；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VHOtJfHKIT3IlXeCJNVeh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nLooksrare给用户带来了新的产品价值，是除OpenSea以外四个交易平台中市场份额占有率最高的交易平台。\n\n![市场份额占有率（除OpenSea）；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ciA8DoZrjgvUTI5WwHBcL.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n![交易手续费（Looksrare为2%，OpeSea为2.5%，X2Y2为0.5%）；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k0ywx0pjmeex7Mv_oEOxF.jpg?height=419&width=1080)\n\n**Token 驱动的市场模型**\n\n近日，Solana 的NFT交易市场将发行自己的Ticket。在某种程度上，Token为平台和交易者提供了共同成长的可能性。OpenSea通过高昂的手续费和服务费获得了可观的收入，但是并没有将收益反哺给用户。值得注意的是，Magic Eden 日活跃用户数量也已有超越 OpenSea 趋势。\n\nLooksRare和Rarible这两个平台也通过发行Token（$LOOKS和$RARI），将平台与用户实现一定程度的利益绑定。例如，用户可以通过质押$LOOKS的方式获得手续费的分成，质押得越多、平台交易越活跃，用户所能得到的奖励（WETH）越多。Token 的引入让用户和平台可以实现共同成长，在社区至上的Web3时代，相比于单方面让用户作为消费者，如何将用户利益融入到平台也是各大NFT市场需要考虑的问题。\n\n## **Yuga Labs：下一个交易平台？**\n\n想象一下排除以下6个Collection后的NFT交易市场：\n\n* Bored Ape Kennel Club\n* Bored Ape Yacht Club\n* Mutant Ape Yacht Club\n* Otherdeed\n* CryptoPunks\n* Meebits\n\nYuga Labs 的野心不局限于 MetaRGP 游戏和PFP，作为 NFT 市场的头部竞争者，其发行的各大项目已经广泛赢得了公众的信任与支持。更重要的是，这些项目也实现了交易数量与交易价值的长期增长。发售$APE代币是Yuga Labs成功的关键一步。目前，Yuga Labs总市值为40.3亿美元，相比于LooksRare价值4.41亿美元的市值。Yuga Labs的潜在市场规模可能在所有以太坊交易平台中位居第二。\n\n![全时段市值（All Time Market Cap）；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_u32IP_ZU02ww9cmN9e-E.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n全时段交易额（All Time Volume）计算了各Collection自发售以来实现的以美元作为货币单位的交易总额。\n\n![全时段交易额；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-CNu-EtqDdZEhRkvJ_Ssd.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n从交易市场统计图（Top Marketplaces）中，我们可以看出，虽然Yuga Labs开发刚满一年，一旦上市，相对于其他交易平台来说，也绝对是一名强有力的竞争者。\n\n![NFT市场排行图；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RpRmpCo35HIcihZNx3Mw_.jpg?height=456&width=1080)\n\n经过上文的数据分析，我们不难看出，Yuga Labs通过抓住 NFT 市场中的头部流量，并通过空投，白名单等增长模式，已为NFT持有者带来不菲的收益，以“从下向上”的模式赋能未来产品模式。\n\n## **结语**\n\n当前市场交易人数金额和整体流动性下降，市场的不稳定性促使人们转向投资更稳定的偏蓝筹NFT资产。以太坊由于头部项目明显，单笔交易额稳居第一，但其他链上的NFT市场有着小额多量的交易趋势，多链市场可以在蓝筹主导的市场下带来更多新的流动性，推动创新和增长。\n\n此外，平台也需要更具原创性的活动来吸引用户。比如新上线的市场Blur在营销策略制定方面取得了一些成效，该平台为早期投资人创立了一种优待模式，同时，为了推广即将上线的测试版，Blur还允许每位OG邀请5位好友共同体验平台测试版，使用测试版就能获得积分，用于兑换平台内的实用工具。Blur营销策略的成功之处就在于将用户转化为平台代言人，让他们为平台发声，吸引其他NFT投资者。\n\n红海厮杀的受益者，永远是用户。但在红海竞争中，NFT交易平台之间的界限也变得越来越清晰，Web3平台的交易模式也会在潜移默化中改变。流量，话语权以及社区，也将会是 NFT 交易市场需要持续关注的命题。\n\n*注释：本文仅供研究使用。投资数字资产（如NFT和数字资产）会有风险，在做出任何投资决定前，请务必咨询财务顾问。NFTGo不提供投资建议，不对任何因投资数字资产造成的损失负责。*", "timestamp": 1654529058, "digest": "AzoUZ4i3P1T77LJphJFxqQKLCcnaoGNn-nO1ufqAQ2E", "contributor": "0xFE0dfc1662E5836F49ad5686A93525efB37Ef818"}

No matter how many times the boom and bust cycle happens, we never seem to learn to put the responsibility on the right people.\n\nWhile there is a lot to say about it generally, I’m here to talk about employers and their responsibility to their existing and future workers. I’ve been increasingly frustrated to see employers cede this responsibility in the most cynical and sinister forms. \n\nSpare me the regular:\n\n1. “This is the way business is, this is what we signed up for when adopting a capitalistic system“ - This might be true, but this is also a classic misdirection tactic. While capitalism discusses profit maximization, it by no means discusses society condoning irresponsible and egregious corporate behavior. \n2. “Cancelling offers is completely legal in most states“ - This is of course true, but this is the problem. We need mechanisms to penalize bad actors that take advantage of the legal system to protect their irresponsible behavior. We should also elevate and profit actors that behave responsibly and do not condone short-term thinking and blame-shifting.\n3. “The market will take care of it, it’s bad business” - Ten years ago I would have said the same, but after repeatedly seeing this is not true. Bad press coverage can be surpassed and people have short memories.\n\n## Why does this matter?\n\nTech-workers are a generally incredibly lucky group of people. Their skills are in extremely high demand and they are compensated generously for their work. Their benefits and conditions are unparalleled to other professions. \n\nThis creates a common set of misconceptions that we see refuted over and over when things turn in the economy:\n\n1. “You have nothing to worry about since your skills are in demand” - While this might be true, it doesn’t negate the incredibly high mental cost of being laid off or having your offer rescinded. Furthermore, in bad markets, it might not necessarily be easy to find a comparable job (not just money-wise, a lot of things go into job satisfaction). \n2. “This is a two-way street, you can also leave your job at any time“ - While this is technically true, it is incredibly misleading. Leaving your job doesn’t result in the corporation losing its livelihood, health insurance for you and your family, your visa (and sometimes results in you being forced out of your home), and dignity. \n3. “Corporations are required by law to maximize profits” - This is of course true, but this is the point. Shareholders don’t have to worry about mass layoffs or generally terrible corporate behavior because the company doesn’t pay a price for it. There needs to be a reputation tax to offset this.\n4. What if the corporations must lay off their workers to save themselves, should they be penalized too? When interviewing for a job, workers routinely are asked to provide background information, pass tests, and convince future colleagues and bosses that they are trustworthy. Why shouldn’t corporations have to go through the same set of hoops? If you had a justified business case for doing what you did, make it to the prospective candidates. If they request further assurances before taking the job, this is the price you have to pay (which I can guarantee you is less than the price the people you laid off had to pay). \n\n## Community-owned reputations database\n\nThe next step is always to create a centralized solution, à la glassdoor, blind, LinkedIn, level.fyi, you name it. This always follows a similar pattern:\n\n1. Mission statement and excitement - centralized service announces they are going to disrupt the market and would never be bought by foreign interests.\n2. Database and community grows - For a while, centralized service acts responsibly and advocates for workers’ rights. \n3. Centralized service is looking to monetize - Generally speaking, providing an honest and impartial platform is pretty bad business. You have all the costs associated with running the service without real monetization options. \n4. Centralized service gets acquired or sells off - Here the owners realize two things: They have valuable data. They can manipulate rankings and surpass information for a price.\n5. Repeat\n\n**The only sustainable approach is to have a worker-owned and managed database that isn’t for sale.** \n\n## What’s next?\n\nI don’t have all the answers to what comes next, but I know that something needs to be done and this is the time to do it. People never rally around these causes in good times because there doesn’t seem to be a need. Imagine the pain of your friends and countrymen that had to endure one or multiple layoffs in recent years. Imagine the pain of people that came to your country to better themselves and their children’s future to be disposed of once they weren’t needed anymore. \n\nI know one project can’t fix everything, but this is a step in the right direction. Bitcoin has changed the way we think about money, and Ethereum has changed the way we envision the web, this is the time to start using it for good.\n\nI’m writing this piece with the backdrop of the horrific shooting in Texas that took the life of 21 innocent children. I’m seeing the lack of care for human life that is shown for the sake of “freedom”.  People should have the freedom the conduct business, but they should do so with dignity and care for the other, we must keep building to ensure it happens.\n\n[crowdfund://0xCA67AA71eE852e539326625ad9D0e273Ab22d155?features=](crowdfund://0xCA67AA71eE852e539326625ad9D0e273Ab22d155?features=)\n\n \n\n[crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654529266, "digest": "QODuEakkJ2LjojFgPCDWAy93kxjYVfENdJ-Wo6ve4Xk", "contributor": "0xCA67AA71eE852e539326625ad9D0e273Ab22d155"}

分享内容-罡哥、William\n\n（Era7游戏内容，亮点，策略等）\n\n我们游戏公会是从AXIE爆火后开始做奖学金计划，在去年很多游戏不管是AXIE,飞船都会遇到死亡螺旋，玩家失去了信心，导致币价下跌。我觉得如果去年是Gamefi1.0的话，今年应该Gamefi2.0。\n\n所以我觉得接下来的游戏会开始做所谓的电竞，会把挖提卖，或者赚钱这件事情focus在高手玩家，但是新玩家也有机会进来争取世界第一或者前10%，也有机会赚到钱。\n\n当初我们在官方接洽的时候是透过币安帮我们引荐的。那个时候我协助他们推广，和项目方直接沟通的时候项目方一直反复强调，想要做走长线的游戏，之后在电竞方面想要很深入地去发展。\n\n来介绍下Era7，卡牌一共共有七个种族，每个种族有四个稀有度，稀有度会影响到卡牌的实力。我是比较建议从稀有入场，所以入场成本可能大概在150busd，假如想要冲排行榜，赚取更高额的奖金，那比较适合史诗卡牌。另外卡牌有power值，指的是可以召唤多少张卡，那如果想要增加召唤次数就会需要去消耗实用代币GOT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QWtPplREgnfj_d2AVNXfy.png?height=942&width=1350)\n\n## 我觉得Era7的几个亮点：\n\n首先美术风格我自己觉得不错的，当然美术风格见仁见智，我自己蛮喜欢这样的风格；\n\n项目方更新比较积极，执行效率不错，游戏刚开始只有英文版本，然后我们跟官方聊对于华人区的玩家不是很友善，他们收到这个消息一个礼拜以后，就有中文了；\n\n第三是卡牌的深度很够。如果你要建立新的卡组，需要放30张卡片，就会导致有很多策略性。因为我自己以前也有玩炉石打上传说过，在大概五六年前，所以我认为游戏的策略性实并不输当时的炉石，不敢说和现在的炉石比，era7一定还有很多进步空间，但我认为卡牌的配合深度是蛮充足的。\n\n## 游戏玩法介绍：\n\n这个游戏它是一个九宫格的站位，一开始给四张牌，可以替换费高的卡牌，如果看到卡牌费不够，可以charge丢弃一张卡换到多一点费。那这回合费值就会到3。在上路中路下路摆放我的卡牌，当同一排对面没有任何卡的时候，就会直接去攻击对方，当对方玩家生命值归零的话，这场对决就胜利了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4DBQ8q27supB7ZW-AmFvj.png?height=705&width=1350)\n\n这个游戏逻辑是以上的内容，其中还会涉及到卡牌的搭配，我的卡牌比较倾向于打快攻，我就加强自己的攻击力，一直去打他的脸。\n\nPlay to earn的奖励在Ranking这里，如果赢一场大概获得2个got，另外如果打到排行榜，还有周奖励和赛季奖励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/llAreBrp7SoyeTHPBA2lt.png?height=714&width=1350)\n\n那玩家是不是氪金越强花很多钱就有可能第一名或者是前三名，这个游戏它比较特殊的地方，就是说他的卡牌呢，调配不错。比如一个大佬花了10万块去建构牌组达到了第一，也有可能只花了4万块达到了前3，我们群里有一个前排玩家上一季也是第一名，整个牌子只花了2万块人民币，所以这个游戏并不是很多钱就会特别强，如果牌组搭配的不好也不一定能够赢，像上次看到算力3600分的跟我打，也输给我。这代表说他的牌组配置有问题，我的配置比较好或者运气比较好，这些在这个游戏上面都是有可能的。\n\n另外卡牌还可以自动挖矿，比如我的算力是13000，每一天大概拿到20个左右代币，这部分的收益比较少，大部分收益还是玩游戏，拼到比较高的报酬。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZOMj8N4KehnuZ-XBHDQ8L.png?height=698&width=1350)\n\n## 代币的消耗\n\n目前游戏的代币是💲GOT和💲ERA（治理代币）\n\n💲GOT代币消耗：之前提到的卡牌召唤；另外是卡牌合成，每张battle card卡片会有四个level，如果要把卡升到level4，要消耗💲GOT，还有8张卡牌，这个消耗就很大。那因为这是传说卡消耗的就会更多，假如这个是史诗卡，它消耗的代币就会比传说卡的小。\n\n## 投资策略\n\n目前投资游戏的策略我们会购买一部分的治理代币，另外我们会把大部分的钱在打排行榜上。我们之前算过，大约1.5-2个月回本。但我们奖学金模式不会像去年做AXIE infinity一样，当时找了非常多菲律宾玩家大概四五百人，做一样的事情，用一样的队伍；在这款游戏上会挑选比较好的玩家，我们上一周和这一周也举办比赛，认识了非常多高手玩家，邀请他们来公会参与奖学金，我们出钱再分润给他，如果玩家非常会玩，就可以打到比较高额的报酬。\n\n这是我们目前认为游戏的一些亮点，还有目前我们公会做的一些投资策略。\n\n## 对于后续电竞方面的看法\n\n回想一下英雄联盟，我大一时台湾有一个英雄联盟的队伍叫台北暗杀星，那时候我在宿舍看台北暗杀星打败韩国队伍，拿到冠军，一个电竞队伍可以到世界舞台，对我来说很感动。我自己觉得电竞这几年发展不像前几年那么兴盛，可能和整个商业、产业有蛮大关系。因为它是非常庞大的组织，如果要办一个比赛，要花费非常多金钱。一个游戏公司要组织战队，要招揽选手，还要养选手，可能一年要几百万几千万美金。游戏选手如果拿到了大赛奖金，要先从游戏公司开始分，还有一些行销，可能100万的奖金只分到20万，相信这是很多电竞选手会遇到的问题。\n\n我觉得WEB3的电竞比较去中心化，比如我在台湾在一个很小的城市，英雄联盟打得再好，没有人会关注到，也没有人给我所谓的电竞奖金。但在WEB3的机会可能崭露头脚，更甚至我可以靠打游戏过活，我可以玩很多游戏，在上面打排行榜可以赚钱。我们在ATTM在上个月也举报era7比赛，报名人数150，实际比赛人数有大约80个。对我们来说举办比赛是一个蛮大的挑战，基本上都是自愿的玩家志愿者来帮忙。\n\n我们也和官方联系，他们确实会在电竞或者说竞技这一块琢磨，后面开发自己的赛事平台。因为我们这次比赛有一个游戏里面的酒馆可以对战，后面官方也会出自己的赛事，至于怎么让玩家在上面比赛可以等官方发布消息。\n\n去年的游戏公会倾向于不管是YGG或者GGG游戏大公会，在Axie爆火时候进行一些募资，我看他们简报基本上都在讲他们的scholar有多少人，比如说YGG好像有4万多名玩p2e，但是我觉得今年可能不是人数谁多谁厉害，游戏公会更专业化、精准化一点会有更多一些机会。今年大部分复制化的挖提卖游戏很容易被淘汰掉，就像AXIE，还有最近的stepn太容易被复制了，就是我天是一个不太走路的人和很会走路的人，我们如果买的鞋子是一样的，我们赚到的钱是一样的，我认为gamefi脱离这样能够复制的模式，才能让真正的玩家去赚到这些钱。\n\n但我认为在WEB3的世界确实还非常早期，我不敢说未来怎么样，很多游戏还没有办法对自己的token有很大的共识度，资产还不够去中心化。像猴子是非常去中心化的资产，大部分链游现在也是相当中心化的。那如果能办电竞，引入外部的更大更多的资金去举办实体的电竞比赛，跟实体去结合，才有可能有更大的发展，如果单纯纯走虚拟的，可能硬核度不是很够。\n\n# 三 自由讨论-GMA社区玩家\n\n**（培才总）**\n\n我在想一个困扰我很久的问题，链游怎么样才能成功？因为我们投资链游最核心的就是怎么样找到有价值的链游。今天听了一个播客，里面提了一个观点还挺有启发。传统应用和WEB3D应用的核心区别是什么？想要成功一定要迎合某种价值主张或者达成用户的某种需求。那**链游和传统游戏相比到底迎合了用户的哪些价值主张？换句话说，用户哪些需求是在传统游戏没有被满足的？**\n\n从这个角度来考虑非常有价值的，很多人会把元宇宙也从两个角度里去理解，一部分希望元宇宙给身临其境的体验，在区块链里就叫可玩性派，希望链游有足够的可玩性。还有一派会把元宇宙理解为加密资产派，不仅仅是画面也希望里面像真实的世界有真实价值，主价值的的资产，有一些智能合约。回到链游可能也要从这两个角度，**链游能不能提供有价值的资产，第二个能不能提供有价值的信息。**\n\n那么所谓的信息就是指可玩性，传统游戏里面或者前面两位嘉宾介绍卡牌游戏的可玩性，画风，美术。但是在WEB3应用里面用户的优先级比较高的是资产其次是信息。这可能有点儿对应比特币，没什么可玩性但提供了非常有价值的资产，比特币可以把它理解为第一个web3应用，或者第一个区块链游戏，但基本上没什么可玩性。以太访我觉得在比特的基础上强化了可玩性，但是资产性要稍微弱一点，他牺牲了去中心化的程度，牺牲了一些资产的安全性。gamefi我觉得是在以太坊基础上更一轮的升级，他们发展的顺序，也是先有btc后有eth，然后才有区块链游戏。区块链游戏里面也不能脱离资产，虽然资产肯定没有比特币这么硬，但是也不能像传统游戏里的金币那么软。\n\n如果一个好的区块链游戏，能不能提供一些比较硬的资产？拿era7为例，里面最硬的资产是token，\\*\\*那token的硬度、价值来源是值得我们思考的问题。\\*\\*我们前面玩过很多资产硬度上做的不好，股权代币分发的方式说改就改，分发过程也非常不公平，项目方甚至全一级的投资者机构拿了大量廉价筹码，导致大家慢慢对项目丧失了信心，也就慢慢倒闭了。另外资产的价值也来自可玩性，就像以太坊有一定的功能性，但功能性和安全性是强相关的，以太坊的核心价值是上面长出了各种各样的应用和其他资产，在用以太坊体系的时候就自动要消耗gas，这部分系统的收入分发给了以太坊持有者。\n\n另外猴子也在讲元宇宙或者游戏的概念，他的做法非常聪明，虽然还没有任何游戏性，但已经创造了非常庞大的资产：无聊猿+变异猿+土地+ape coin资产的总规模已经有几百亿美金了。而且猴的fpf价值是可以脱离游戏存在的，没有游戏也会把它拿来做头像，也就是说游戏有了一部分共识的赋能。这个也是非常棒的做法，也是很多区块链的游戏应该学习的地方，能不能有一部分资产可以脱离体系存在，era7的token现在离不开游戏，如果游戏如果比如说项目上不开发了，没人玩了，那相信这个资产会归零，但是猴子可能就游戏有没有成功会影响头像的价值，但是头像本身就已经很有价值，甚至没有游戏依然还有价值，这是很厉害的。\n\n刚好在链游底层逻辑上的一些思考，趁这个机会给大家分享，希望收到大家的反馈，era7持有代币的价值在哪？\n\n**（罡哥）**\n\n目前代币的问题不论是got和era都通过生成卡，合成卡去做消耗。前几个礼拜成立了dao，就是持有多少era可以参加投票。炉石官方自己有评估的卡牌太强或太弱，官方可能就会在下一个赛季去削弱或加强。era有做一个dao，质押后获得ve，这些票可以用来投票做更动，不管是加强还是削弱让大家来决定。我觉得这个可能在传统游戏是没办法看到的，也是蛮特别的部分。\n\n我们公会其实有接触到不同的游戏，目前我们认为比较好玩的游戏偏卡牌，也归根于开发区块链游戏的厂商可能大部分还不够给力，没有真正的MMORPG游戏出来，那我们也有接触到其他的游戏，然后目前来说确实是培才总刚才说的token都focus在游戏应用里，目前确实比较少用途。\n\n`（培才总）`\n\n我觉得这个挺有意思，刚才想了想一般链游里面资产的种类分为：token和NFT。\n\n赋能主要是游戏内和游戏外赋能，但是很多链游游戏外的赋能是不够的，如果游戏性又不好，很多链游就衰亡了。游戏本身没可玩性，代币的价值就主要是来自于游戏内，就形成了恶性循环。\n\n**1）游戏外的赋能方式：**\n\n什么是资产的游戏外的赋能呢？以token为例，**defi是一个比较好的游戏外赋能的方式**，它有点像btc的挖矿，代币的获取是有成本的，要么提供流动性承担了无常损失，要么拿其他交易对去换代币，至少是有成本的，前阵子ama时候说tiny砍了一池其实未必是个好事。我觉得链游在这么早期的阶段，游戏性不能很好给代币赋能的时候，采用游戏外的赋能也蛮有价值的。\n\n还有一个是通过社交媒体给NFT资产赋能。比较好的例子就是猴子，通过把NFT资产在社交媒体上炒热，也会形成一部分的共识价值。这部分共识价值虽然还不知道是不是有泡沫，但确实是一个方式，来给资产做游戏外的赋能。\n\n广告也是一个点，和刚才嘉宾说的电子竞技一样，电竞某种程度上有一定广告价值，不仅电竞，所有的体育比赛都是这样，体育比赛从来不是让参赛队伍出钱的，而是卖转播权收广告费，然后把收到的钱分一部分给电竞选手。但我觉得电竞和IP这个会不会早期不太好走，至少电竞你得有一定的影响力，广告商才愿意付费，IP可能会稍微容易些，猴子算是一个特例吧。\n\n**2）游戏内的赋能方式：**\n\n比较常见是通过榜单的模式，还有在新人的进入、在游戏的收入环节，把一部分利润烧掉或者放到社区金库里面，或者回购代币项目。可能游戏内赋能就是几种方式吧，有一些真金白银的收入，直接分红或者是销毁，或者买了token质押在那儿，就直接通过合约的形式分红给大家，mobox主要是通过销毁的形式，会在交易市场收到的手续费去销毁；另外鼓励大家锁流动性，锁一定期限，就给更多的奖励。\n\n（Adam）\n\n因为我本身也是era7游戏玩家，对卡牌稍微了解。我认为对于WEB3游戏web2的区别在于：WEB3最初期就要把自己想象成一个经济体。经济体像国家一样需要人口支撑，就是新的流量进来，新的流量会带着钱去购买NFT资产，然后通过一些操作得到了游戏代币，代币带来经济效应可能又吸引了一部分新的用户进来。\n\n这里我觉得就分成两个线：资产派和信息派。信息派其实更偏web2，互联网是打破信息壁垒，web3主要是做了资产所属权的固定。那在这个游戏里，我认为主要是把自己的经济体做大，从另外一个角度来讲，游戏本身的世界观如果足够大，做游戏内资产发行的多样性就会比较多，营销的手段就会比较多。这也是前面提到像用社交媒体去做一些不同类型NFT资产发行，用户投钱进来之后想办法把形成文化共识固定在这儿。第二种就是在token的应用层面上，除了前面提到的defi挂钩相关的，跟本身游戏奖励相关的，还有era7后面的七大种族、涉及到nft地皮，资产增值的方式。其他新的玩法也可能会涉及到，比如说类似发展成BNB的类似于平台币的感觉。然后罡哥提到如果做线下的电竞赛事，游戏代币本身也可以配合NFT资产作为赛事的门槛，或者所谓参赛的条件、观赏的条件。\n\n另外我也想讨论的是gamefi从最开始的页游，慢慢有一些制作精良的游戏，到后面的3a大作。像TCP卡牌类游戏有点类似于轻竞技，一局3分钟，但是长流非常好留存率很好，对设备的要求很低。现在很多大的公司都在冲3a，也要考虑到对设备的要求会不会导致我们想转化的流量根本进不来，这是关于流量层面的一个点。在流量对接层面上，公会的账户NFT租赁体系在游戏是很重要的，因为web3用户进来时候就是投资人+用户，玩着玩着产生分歧，要么觉得游戏不好玩儿抛币走人，要么觉得游戏可能会火持续投入，但持续投入到一定程度之后，会觉得在游戏赚钱和投钱差距太大就变成了投资人，那他游戏活跃度就下降。所以这时候NFT可能租赁体系，就会相对而言就会降低进来的门槛，让投资人更专注做NFT的流动性，做投资，打游戏的专注于打游戏。\n\n**（培才总）**\n\n我也认可，目前我觉得有一个发展路径的问题是资产和信息是相互促成的循环，要么是正反馈，要么是负反馈。像3a的游戏有一个问题：信息性能不能给资产赋能，如果游戏品质很好，又有非常好的机制给游戏内的资产赋能，确实会比较好。比如原来传统游戏能不能直接通过链改，目前只能看到一个实例就是传奇4的可玩性是不错的，也是对得起3a的名号，我觉得传奇4的问题是没有很好给游戏内的资产赋能。\n\n还没有用到区块链技术，比如CSGO和梦幻西游，里面确实是有一些有价值的资产的，那这部分资产的价值可能来自于通过信息性赋能资产性的一个终局，里面有一些皮肤是很贵的，因为开箱子机制，或者有几十万的玩家，就造成虽然没有运用区块链基础也没有token，但是里面的资产也可以炒的很贵。可以用信息游戏性来给游戏内的资产赋能。\n\n我不知道现在区块链游戏能不能直接走到这一步，因为这两个游戏也是通过早期的积累，这条路恐怕不太好走，游戏内的资产的价值来源全是来自于游戏或者信息性的话，其实还是挺难的。\n\n**（唐旻）**\n\n其实要赋能非常简单，我以前做过端游的，**在我看来WEB3游戏和WEB2的游戏其实本质上核心的东西就是经济系统**。大部分游戏在开服的时候的代币是价值最高的，随着游戏逐步进展，金币源源不断生产出来，金币必然是贬值的。达到一定程度以后会维持在相对稳定的状态，但是长久以来肯定是缓慢下跌的。 端游里面很考验的经济系统和现在WEB3的一样，因为WEB3所有代币都是慢慢产出，必然会缓慢下跌，而且不像端游可以通过新服来操作，代币算是价值初始化，就像那重启web3没法做到这样的机制代币体系必然会缓慢下降，因为总量一定在增加，除非有不停的新用户增量进来，但是新用户迟早也会有瓶颈。\n\nWEB3比web2的优势是没有游戏厂商在抽血。以前免费游戏的金币是承受双重抽血的：一个是缓慢蒸发，还有一个是游戏厂商拿到了大头。如果游戏厂商把拿走的钱还回到游戏里，做一个更好的不通胀的经济体系，在以前的端游时代应该是可以做到的。\n\n我觉得WEB3以后是把游戏厂商在以前免费玩时，卖免费道具这中代币赋能的形式回馈到游戏。比如说游戏厂商来卖免费道具的，比如说像炉石是游戏厂商来卖，抽掉很大一部分，我如实适用我炉石里面的代币来开卡，那等于是把暴雪的收益全部注回到游戏。我觉得这是游戏里面最强大的赋能形式，其他的赋能都免不了庞氏的结局。我觉得WEB3的模式就是游戏厂商不再从游戏里面吸血，大家都能从里面去获利。\n\n回到这款游戏era7，比如要我来设计给他赋能，像欢乐豆是纯产出的，但欢乐豆是有价值的，就是在游戏中消耗，比如era7的游戏设计房间，代币要像欢乐豆那样带进去的，那它的消耗就滚起来了，然后游戏代币一部分给持有者，一部分给厂商，让它源源不断的消耗，代币还是要回归到游戏里面。以前端游时代本来确实是有价值的，但是它本来应该承受的价值很大一部分被游戏厂商拿走了。它里面的经济体系很容易崩盘。WEB3阶段的游戏厂商刚开始NFT发售会拿走一部分，但游戏厂商应该把这部分回归游戏，让游戏代币来承受免费道具的发放，形成一个循环。\n\n**备注：GMA的内容只做参考，不构成投资建议，投资需谨慎，大家量力而行，谢谢。**\n\n\n---\n\n#

No matter how many times the boom and bust cycle happens, we never seem to learn to put the responsibility on the right people.\n\nWhile there is a lot to say about it generally, I’m here to talk about employers and their responsibility to their existing and future workers. I’ve been increasingly frustrated to see employers cede this responsibility in the most cynical and sinister forms.\n\nSpare me the regular:\n\n1. “This is the way business is, this is what we signed up for when adopting a capitalistic system“ - This might be true, but this is also a classic misdirection tactic. While capitalism discusses profit maximization, it by no means discusses society condoning irresponsible and egregious corporate behavior.\n2. “Cancelling offers is completely legal in most states“ - This is of course true, but this is the problem. We need mechanisms to penalize bad actors that take advantage of the legal system to protect their irresponsible behavior. We should also elevate and profit actors that behave responsibly and do not condone short-term thinking and blame-shifting.\n3. “The market will take care of it, it’s bad business” - Ten years ago I would have said the same, but after repeatedly seeing this is not true. Bad press coverage can be surpassed and people have short memories.\n\n## Why does this matter?\n\nTech-workers are a generally incredibly lucky group of people. Their skills are in extremely high demand and they are compensated generously for their work. Their benefits and conditions are unparalleled to other professions.\n\nThis creates a common set of misconceptions that we see refuted over and over when things turn in the economy:\n\n1. “You have nothing to worry about since your skills are in demand” - While this might be true, it doesn’t negate the incredibly high mental cost of being laid off or having your offer rescinded. Furthermore, in bad markets, it might not necessarily be easy to find a comparable job (not just money-wise, a lot of things go into job satisfaction).\n2. “This is a two-way street, you can also leave your job at any time“ - While this is technically true, it is incredibly misleading. Leaving your job doesn’t result in the corporation losing its livelihood, health insurance for you and your family, your visa (and sometimes results in you being forced out of your home), and dignity.\n3. “Corporations are required by law to maximize profits” - This is of course true, but this is the point. Shareholders don’t have to worry about mass layoffs or generally terrible corporate behavior because the company doesn’t pay a price for it. There needs to be a reputation tax to offset this.\n4. What if the corporations must lay off their workers to save themselves, should they be penalized too? When interviewing for a job, workers routinely are asked to provide background information, pass tests, and convince future colleagues and bosses that they are trustworthy. Why shouldn’t corporations have to go through the same set of hoops? If you had a justified business case for doing what you did, make it to the prospective candidates. If they request further assurances before taking the job, this is the price you have to pay (which I can guarantee you is less than the price the people you laid off had to pay).\n\n## Community-owned reputations database\n\nThe next step is always to create a centralized solution, à la glassdoor, blind, LinkedIn, level.fyi, you name it. This always follows a similar pattern:\n\n1. Mission statement and excitement - centralized service announces they are going to disrupt the market and would never be bought by foreign interests.\n2. Database and community grows - For a while, centralized service acts responsibly and advocates for workers’ rights.\n3. Centralized service is looking to monetize - Generally speaking, providing an honest and impartial platform is pretty bad business. You have all the costs associated with running the service without real monetization options.\n4. Centralized service gets acquired or sells off - Here the owners realize two things: They have valuable data. They can manipulate rankings and surpass information for a price.\n5. Repeat\n\n**The only sustainable approach is to have a worker-owned and managed database that isn’t for sale.**\n\n## What’s next?\n\nI don’t have all the answers to what comes next, but I know that something needs to be done and this is the time to do it. People never rally around these causes in good times because there doesn’t seem to be a need. Imagine the pain of your friends and countrymen that had to endure one or multiple layoffs in recent years. Imagine the pain of people that came to your country to better themselves and their children’s future to be disposed of once they weren’t needed anymore.\n\nI know one project can’t fix everything, but this is a step in the right direction. Bitcoin has changed the way we think about money, and Ethereum has changed the way we envision the web, this is the time to start using it for good.\n\nI’m writing this piece with the backdrop of the horrific shooting in Texas that took the life of 21 innocent children. I’m seeing the lack of care for human life that is shown for the sake of “freedom”.

{"id": "rPXzV8nUFbp8OCWVlrODQcVJg4rIMDD68-ksr0SFDMA", "title": "The UX Tipping Point is going to kill Web3 products", "body": "I was speaking to some co-founders when I was in San Francisco recently for Startup Grind, mainly around ZeroToDesign and how we help startups.\n\nThe co-founders were on opposite ends of the outsourcing scale for their Product & UX design. One was very chilled about the idea of Z2D coming in and owning their Design function — *let’s call him Dude1*. The other,\\* let’s call him Dude2\\*, was completely against it, as he wanted to have a proper in-house team to handle their Product Design.\n\nWe’ve seen these two personas from the very beginning of Z2D. It’s a founder conversation, and how happy they are to have what on paper is an outsourced function for their product (we don’t work like an outsourced function but that’s a topic for another time).\n\nOur conversation then took a turn when *Dude1* made an interesting point. He said:\n\n> There’s no problem in outsourcing when the product isn’t your entire business.\n\nWhen your product isn’t the entire business. Interesting. What he was saying was that when there are *other* USPs in your business, beyond just the (typically SaaS) product you are creating, then outsourcing isn’t a problem, because it’s not the be-all and end-all for your business, there are other things customers care about that you provide.\n\n*(I disagree with the idea of outsourcing being appropriate for non-primary products — but I do accept that many startups feel they need to control their experience in-house to make it great. I don’t think it needs to be this way but that’s my biased opinion while I create an awesome agency)*\n\nI didn’t have an opinion when Dude1 spoke, I wanted to let the point settle in my head, but my gut said that makes sense. **I’ve worked in many startups that didn’t care/invest much about their Product & UX Design but still were great businesses that would be profitable, funded multiple times, and even turn into unicorns.**\n\nAs much as I want to drive for a great user experience in products, the reality is that it’s not always necessary for every company. \\*\\*For a lot of Web3 products right now, the focus is on functionality, not usability. \\*\\*So it got me thinking about the reasons why and how this occurs…\n\n## A Twitter thread\n\n[Daniel Rhodes responded to a thread](https://twitter.com/danielrhodes/status/1520455399001841665?s=20&t=AXiuBmCISzGxXESbT3dJjA) on Twitter recently:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/05Ce-Ju4vP_6TBJgsfsS-.png?height=1044&width=1182)\n\n> ‘How does good UX make banks more money?’\n\nIt’s a great question, and to me, there’s a simple answer:\n\n**Competiton + easy transferability.**\n\nIt made me think there’s a matrix of some sort for products across these two variables. So I created a chart to illustrate some types of products/platforms, and where they sit.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*W9Y8_-Q9_XYdi86lMxYetA.png)\n\nTransferability renamed to Switching.\n\nAs we’d expect, there aren’t going to be that many products that sit in a low competition zone. In this day and age, low competition will not last for long. That’s the key, you can feel this sense of invisibility when there is nothing else out there for your customers to just switch easily, but that day will come. Let’s call this transition (dashed line) the\\*\\* UX Tipping Point\\*\\*.\n\nThis is where not caring much about your UX really falls apart.\n\nWeb3 products haven’t hit their tipping point yet in 2022, and they’re operating under some pre-tipping point scenarios, but I predict come 2024 they’ll be well inside.\n\n## Pre UX tipping point scenarios\n\nI think there are 3 main scenarios that mean *for a period of time* you might not have to worry about a user’s experience that much\\*.\\*\n\n## Multi-product offering\n\nThis is from the example at the start of the article. Where your business doesn’t solely rely on one product to generate revenue.\n\nAn example from my past is Goodlord, which is a real-estate management platform primarily but offers alternative products to its customers like insurance and contract signing.\n\nThis allows the primary SaaS product — the management tool to not be in the spotlight for their customers and *ultimately their balance sheet*. So the UX takes a back seat because the whole product takes a back seat.\n\n## Monopolies\n\nWhen you are the sole owner of your space/niche, what will customers do if your UX is trash?\n\n[Footyaddicts.com](http://footyaddicts.com/) and [Spareroom.co.uk](https://www.spareroom.co.uk/) are good examples of this. Both are 2-sided marketplaces in the UK, and absolutely dominate their individual markets, football games, and renting respectively. Their experiences are sub-par in the grand scheme of things, but we as customers have no alternative options for signing up to football games and renting easily (in London) so we live with it.\n\n## Early-adopter customer base\n\nI touched on this in a [previous article about the challenge for Web3 products with UI/UX](https://medium.com/zero-to-design/why-web3-will-have-the-hardest-ui-ux-challenge-any-industry-has-ever-faced-b418d3cc75fe).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*SeT63IaxRWXNgkGS.png)\n\nWhen you have a product that makes a quantum leap in technology and thus 100x’s the *complete* \\*experience, \\*not just the digital product experience, then simply put, people are willing to take a poor UX. This is because whatever they were doing before, would’ve taken so many more steps and hours that it’s figuring out the new product while it's still not intuitive.\n\nCrypto FX is a good example of this. Cryptocurrency allows you to send payments instantly to anyone (their wallet) in the world. Pretty powerful stuff.\n\nBut it can be a bit of a hassle to take money from USD to XRP to GBP using wallets, not all the experiences that exist today are super seamless at converting using crypto. However, if you try moving money from USD to GBP and you’ll either get hammered with fees ($40 wire transfers) or it’ll take 3–5 business days.\n\nSo the quantum leap is worth a weird experience for early adopters.\n\nThis won’t last forever though. Eventually, players will see the potential and build similar products built on the improved technology, and this is already happening.\n\nFor Web3 products right now, Early-adopter customer bases and Monopolies are the most common scenarios. These 2 do have an overlap period because by its nature an early-adopter product might be a monopoly as no one else has created its quantum leap product *yet*. Within these scenarios, it can feel like UX isn’t a priority, but that can quickly change…\n\n## Example— Sketch\n\nFrom the UX Tipping Point chart, you can see UI design tools in 2021 sit inside the tipping point, but they weren’t always like that. It was a very different story in 2015, competition was much lower, as Figma and Adobe XD hadn’t launched.\n\nSketch was a UI design software from the 2010s. It was a quantum leap in software for Product & Visual Designers relative to Photoshop and occupied a nice monopoly in the mid-2010s.\n\nBut their UX had big holes, like no real-time collab, lack of community, and a heavy native Mac application. There were plenty of other issues, like platform updates being once a year. Then Figma launched in 2015, then Adobe XD in 2016, and these started to gain traction. The monopoly Sketch enjoyed faded as more tools came, and then the market share drastically changed…\n\nFrom **Sketch at 7x that of Figma in 2017:**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ptmOR7KdkW961IXN4R0k2A.png)\n\nTo **Figma being 3x Sketch in 2021**:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*KlI4dxqYDQV-Za8d4ME4PQ.png)\n\nFigma at almost 3x Sketch\n\nIt’s a crazy fall from grace for what once was the darling of UI design.\n\n> Don’t be Sketch, invest in UX.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BDv-J4SeuyBBBs0Xj0Bwxw.png)\n\n5-year Google Trends graph for Sketch (black) and Figma (blue)\n\nThe survey was run by [UX Tools](https://uxtools.co/) which has over 14k subscribers on its email list and had >3k respondents to their 2021 survey, a fair sample size for designers and their tool choices.\n\nWith Web3 products right now, it’s either so early that there are early adopters willing to take poor UX because it's a quantum leap in technology, or they have a monopoly, such as MetaMask with non-custodial wallets. But MetaMask has players like Argent.xyz which has a tremendous UX, and I can foresee a similar fate from Sketch & Figma in a few years.\n\nTo avoid a fate like Sketch, startups and their products will need to focus on making good user experiences **before** they reach their UX Tipping Point, rather than scrambling for high-quality and expensive designers when they suddenly get there.\n\nThat’s where I come in.\n\nSakky B\n\n[Zerotodesign.com](https://zerotodesign.com)", "timestamp": 1654529284, "digest": "W71qCCYQgqp5fspbY6yLlVlvFmNVpA0tn6QRpANQFmE", "contributor": "0xc2164d1754682943327c2E2229967dA5643827D2"}

This is a meme project, make no mistake.\n\nCliche time; Merriam Webster defines ‘meme’ as: *an amusing or interesting item (such as a captioned picture or video) or genre of items that is spread widely online especially through social media.*\n\nThat more or less covers it. The internet changed the world. Perhaps the biggest change is that it brought the world a lot closer. It is believed we produce 2.5 QUINTILLION bytes of data per day. That’s like downloading the complete works of Mozart approximately 1/7th the number of times as there are grains of sand on earth. Confusing, right? 4 years in America will have you using anything but the metric system. Accurate? Who’s gonna count and confirm?\n\nAnyway, a lot of this data is being transmitted almost instantaneously over the internet. To put this in perspective, you could send the complete works of Shakespeare to someone as many as 1.75 million times as there are planets in the universe in the time it would take you to send the same to someone without using the internet in any way ONCE. Amazing, innit?\n\nOkay enough jibber jabber. I’ve made my point. A result of this amazing speed of information sharing is being able to discuss stuff in live time. Now when rich Americans decide to buy a popular company with a bird logo, you don’t have to wait till they’ve already started pretending to do ‘due diligence’ in order to drive down the price,Nope…you’ll start seeing jokes about it on that surveillance device you keep within range at all times.\n\nWe know you get your news from meme pages, don’t worry…us too.\n\nMemes have become a crucial part of human society. In fact, I would go as far as to say they are the single most important cultural creation of the 21st century. Memes are borderless, from the 'dee O double G' all the way to a random kid in Southeast Asia who decided to take pictures of himself every day. Memes encompass the entirety of the trippy ass spectrum that is human emotion and deliver it to us in a slightly easier to digest way.\n\nAs Alfred Hitchcock said, “Exposition is a pill that has to be sugar-coated. In other words, you are giving them information, but at the time it must seem like something else. ” ([here’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEq2XjFCaps) a great video on exposition for any film nerds reading this).\n\nThe point is - memes are useful, important, and fun (Oxford comma much?). Memes are here to stay.\n\nThe phenomenon that is the Internet is also what enables the creation of your favorite buzzwords: Metaverse & Cryptocurrency. We are far closer to plugging into the soulless utopia of bright colors and algorithmically generated emotions than you think. Ready? Player One.\n\nThe very ideas of ownership are changing. For the first time, we are exploring the digital realm, being able to do our favorite thing: own stuff. Enter NFTs. The latest descendant in a long line of honeypots originating all the way back to the great Tulip of mid-17th century Netherlands.\n\nThe NFT is possible because of a little something called the Blockchain. You probably know what that is by now. If not, read more man…seriously pick up a phone some time.\n\nAnyway, it is largely agreed that the two major value propositions of the blockchain are decentralization and security. But I believe there are two equally, if not more, important adds are incentivisation and community.\n\nAnyone in the NFT space already knows about the power of community, a bunch of people doing word of mouth marketing for you with vested interest? Hell yeah. And as for incentivization, we’re only beginning to explore that plethora of possibilities. We can create models that allow rewarding people for anything. And I mean…anything([SEXN - a first of it’s kind sex-to-earn protocol](https://twitter.com/mattysino/status/1530215852037050368?s=20&t=oeFix0P1C2Q7Vw2NrrdrUg)). Yeah…everything is going to zero.\n\n(All these things combined are what we call Web3.)\n\nBUUUUUT, in case it’s not, we think the meme itself should find a way into this “Web3” too. In a manner that’s keeping up with the times. *And that is what NotLuna is all about.*\n\nNow that you know the “Why?”, let’s talk about the “What?”.\n\nNotLuna is a collection of 10,000 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. NotLuna is NOT, in any way, a reference to one of the best memes in history. It does NOT take inspiration from perhaps what is one of the greatest stories of human hubris.\n\nBut you know what they say: comedy is tragedy plus time…and we’re laughing about it already.\n\nNo, NotLuna is about a person, just like all of us.\n\nMeet Do Gen:\n\n![Do Gen](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WLaJ-Za_GlDVG71d3jQUn.png?height=1000&width=1000)\n\nJust like all of us, he’s trying to make it in Web3 too. And just like all of us, he goes through many emotions.\n\nDo was born in NotSeoul in a time well before Web3. But technology always spoke to him. In fact, he even studied at the prestigious NotStanford community and then went on to work for behemoths like NotApple and NotMicrosoft. But it was in the blockchain that he found his calling.\n\nNow he spends his days trying to find the next big thing and when he has time from that, he tries to create something of his own. Oh and he loves to water his plants, whatever that’s about.\n\nJoin Do on this emotional roller coaster that is the decentralized internet.\n\nGMI or NGMI? Only one way to find out. (mint it)\n\n## FAQs\n\n* Wen mint?\n\nNot sure yet, but super soon.\n\n* Free, right?\n\nYeah yeah. Y’all been conned one too many times for us to be able to charge you for this. But we’re keeping 1000 and we don’t need to explain why.\n\n* Roadmap?\n\nYeah, as if you read roadmaps…you’re in it for the vibes and so are we.\n\n* Really, nothing planned?\n\nNot per se, but some people believe that when Do Gen was born, a mystic made a prophecy that if Do Gen’s collection reached a 1E floor, he would find his wife Di Gen and together they would create an army of De Gens. So we’ll see.\n\n* Who are you?\n\nAh yes, the team. Another metric you pretend to look at before “aping in”.\n\nThe writer of this paper is @cryptanosaurus. I have been degening on the blockchain for about 6 years now and am now building something pretty cool (shameless plugin). Check it out here: [https://novadao.xyz/#/](https://novadao.xyz#/)\n\nOh and the mint link will be released in Nova’s discord so you probably want to hop in there.\n\nAnd the Co-Founder, Archie, is an artist and architect. He has been in charge of bringing these traits to life.\n\nThe funny thing is, Archie and I have never met in real life. We met each other through the mutual ownership of the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO. Maybe NFTs do have some promise after all. They bring people together .\n\nYou can suss us out on Twitter, we’re legit (like legit enough for you to take a free NFT from us).\n\n* Hey these faces look familiar…what’s that about?\n\nIf these expressions ring a bell, you’re old enough to stop wasting time on random mints and get a real job. Ur old and ur poor and ur still wasting time on memes. But yeah, we felt a great way to begin the Web3 meme journey is with an ode to the first memes.

NFT数据（Something Token）\n\n### 2.1 筹码结构\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BXekLr2knSVKysHmS0TDRw.png)\n\nSomething Token的筹码结构较为分散，持有人数为4.5K，人均持有2.2个NFT。\n\n持有1个NFT的人数为2974，占比65.41%；持有2\\~3个NFT的人数为1019，占比22.41%；持有4个及以上的人数为554，占比12.18%。\n\n持有100个以上NFT的共有3人，分别持有276，131，105个，共计512个。持有276个的地址为项目方钱包，持有105个的为888（@crypto888crypto）\n\n### 2.2 蓝筹指数&巨鲸&名人持仓\n\n* Something Token的蓝筹指数为24.87%（数据来源：coniun）\n\n\n* 巨鲸有34个（数据来源：NFTGo，巨鲸定义为持有的NFT价值超过$1M）\n\n> 以下为部分已知的巨鲸&名人持仓：\n>\n> * 888（@crypto888crypto），持有105个\n> * Fvckrender（@fvckrender），持有30个\n> * wave（@0xWave），持有16个\n> * SteveAoki（@steveaoki），持有10个\n> * ben.eth（@eth_ben），持有10个\n> * Redlioneye.eth（@redlioneye13），持有9个\n> * Mcanical · fik.eth（@mcanical），持有8个\n> * JRNY CLUB（@JRNYclub），持有6个\n> * 0xMunger.eth（@0xMunger），持有6个\n> * PAM （@cryptophilip），持有5个\n> * Umar Kamani（@UmarKamani），持有2个\n> * 275.eth（@DegenApeLife），持有2个\n> * Bharat Krymo（@krybharat），持有1个\n\n### 2.3 NFT二级交易情况\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jrSPoUNoqZeK8yt8dXjaSA.png)\n\nSomething Token于4月初发售，在发售后一个月不到的时间内仅mint了几百个。然而在创始人Frey暗示Something Token仅有1个ETH的交易量但被Opensea添加了**蓝标认证**后，剩余的几千个在5月3日全部mint完，并且随着当天融资信息的公布，地板最高达到0.8E左右。\n\n由于有4个稀有度等级（Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary），在开图后地板大幅回调，近一个月各个稀有度等级的NFT均呈现下降趋势（成交价格分布如上图所示）。截止2022年6月4日，各个等级的地板价如下：\n\n* Common: 0.065\n* Rare: 0.14\n* Epic: 0.4\n* Legendary: 1.3\n\n当前Common等级的地板价已破发，低于公售价格（0.069）。\n\n## 3. 官方运营事件\n\n### 3.1 已发生的运营事件\n\n* 5月4日：宣布融资信息；Something Token开图\n* 5月7日：Something Token Holder抽奖，抽了一个Moonbird #9049（\\~25ETH）；公布stacking机制\n* 5月10日：Moonbird开奖，抽奖使用了基于polygon的合约，整个开奖过程透明\n* 5月13日：第一次AMA；公布团队成员推特\n* 5月15日：抽奖抽了一个Doodles，同样通过合约抽奖，5月19日开奖\n* 5月25日：抽奖抽了一个Probably nothing，5月28日开奖\n* 5月27日：第二次AMA；并公布了Something Token的utility\n* 6月4日：宣布赞助了两个今年NFT NYC的活动\n\n### 3.2 未来运营事件预期\n\n* 每双周AMA\n* 6月会参加NFT NYC并现场演示Americana的机制和交易过程\n* 持有者空投\n* 预计今年夏天上线Americana marketplace\n\n## 4. 个人分析\n\n### 4.1 对Americana团队的看法\n\n我个人对Americana团队的信任程度较高，认为rug风险较低，主要体现在：\n\n（1）核心成员Frey和Terp都有比较丰富的NFT经验，并且从Frey公开的信息中得知他曾为Apple Pay，Twitter等知名产品工作（可能是类似产品经理的岗位），因此个人对Americana的产品研发持一个乐观的态度。\n\n（2）Americana有资方（Reddit创始人、Opensea、rapper Future等）和明星、NFT巨鲸背书（888、SteveAoki等），一二级收入均打入社区钱包且公开透明，当前还有750+ETH以及690万美元融资，项目方短期内可能不缺资金。\n\n（3）从过往运营事件来看（虽然还不多），基本都按照既定的时间来交付，暂时没有看到跳票。从Discord、推特等互动反馈来看交付的质量比较好，相关的公告和文档说明可以看出是有统一标准和管理的。\n\n（4）整个5月抽了三次比较大的奖（Moonbird、Doodles、Probably Nothing），总价值约为40\\~50ETH，均是从二级购入后即发布抽奖信息。这几次抽奖所有过程都是公开透明，项目方会公布有效的地址列表（包括了稀有度加权计算明细）上传至IPFS存储，并且开奖过程通过智能合约来执行，增强了抽奖可信度，也可以看出项目方技术水平和效率很高，也舍得花钱。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*qFIS2VPyWaE6YDgiDErzWw.png)\n\n（5）从发售完毕截止目前，项目方没有做过大型的营销活动，主要是创始人Frey和Terp在推特上发起Something token的NFT抽奖，以及和一些大v互动。无论是抽奖还是个人观点，推特互动数据都比较好，转赞评总数基本上都在三位数，抽奖的互动可以达到四位数（但是也不排除买互动数据、机器人的可能性，暂没有深挖）。\n\n（6）官网的设计比较一般，项目方在官网释放NFT的utility信息时留有悬念，关键信息还未释放出，给了大家想象空间。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UMkaQJ3RIbQbzeecrDL4xw.png)\n\n（7）从官方第一次AMA信息得知，Americana的部分dev是世界顶尖水平的，将会构建庞大的生态系统。芯片是Java定制芯片，dev目前正在开发公钥和私钥。\n\n### 4.2 对Something Token价格、价值及赛道的看法\n\nAmericana打算做一个IRL的NFT marketplace，而Something Token我个人将其定位成Pass卡类的NFT，因此他与常规的小图片不同，会更加注重于产品上线后的实用功能和权益。\n\n核心产品暂未上线，加上当前整体NFT市场环境来看，在没有重大利好的情况下，短期内Something Token的价格会处于低位横盘的状态，且项目方短期内也还没有重大的营销计划。从筹码结构，蓝筹指数和巨鲸持有数据来看，在未来没有重大利空的情况下，个人对其价格上涨持一个乐观的态度。\n\nAmericana计划的IRL NFT交易市场以及将实体物品NFT化这个想法比较创新，有很大的想象空间，且市面上暂时也没看到有力的竞争对手（可能是我还不知道），IRL的NFT赛道还处于蓝海阶段，如果能出圈可能会带来NFT玩家的指数级增长。但另一方面，IRL物品NFT化并且进行交易这个需求是否会被web2用户认可还有待考证，对于奢侈品、收藏品、艺术品来说可能会产生一定需求，具体落地可能出现的问题有：NFTA芯片是否会造假/丢失/掉包；芯片和交易的稳定性；对于web2用户准入门槛较高，需要科普一定区块链知识等。\n\nOpensea作为Americana的资方，将来有可能会接入Americana生态系统，并且此前Opensea推出Seaport协议，想象空间也很大。\n\nAmericana会在今年6月的NFT NYC上现场演示交易demo，届时可以关注一下。\n\n## 5.

I primarily shoot medium format film for most of my work, but I was looking for a compact but high quality 35mm point and shoot to add to my kit.\n\n![my \\*rare\\* blue olympus XA2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gHP_1ZOMTLfqAgA9PCURB.JPG?height=1152&width=1440)\n\nThe XA2 checks all the boxes for me, and I found a really cute blue one so I decided to pull the trigger. I am headed to NYC later this month and really needed to snag a camera and properly test it beforehand. I don’t want to get too nerdy about why the XA2 is a good fit for me but this camera slides into my workflow in a way that not a lot of 35mm cameras can. I use a medium format range finder for most of my work, and because of that I end up zone focusing a lot. The XA2 is a zone focus system so it makes sense for me, and fits into my workflow so perfectly. I’ll get into the zone focus a little more later. So if you’re not sure that that means, sit tight. <3\n\n### Test Roll One\n\nThe day this camera came in the mail I flew to the local camera shop after work to grab some batteries and a roll of 35mm film (Ilford FP4+ to be specific) and then quickly headed back to my house to rip apart the box that was lovingly packaged and sent all the way from Japan.\n\nI was supposed to climb at a local crag with some buddies that evening, so I figured I’d just quickly fire off a roll and develop it when I got home later. Low-stress first roll. I just wanted to make sure everything worked.\n\n![a type of photo lovingly called 'first of the roll' // light leaks from loading the film obscure a portion of the first frame ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/anzoehKE6ekG39b5hte-w.jpeg?height=2136&width=2670&&&&size=medium)\n\nI really had barely looked at a manual for the XA2 online before I loaded up a roll of film, snapped a few shots in the backyard and then headed to go climb. I really only wanted to make sure the camera actually worked, I wasn’t too hung up on the roll being full of great pictures or even a single good picture. My main concerns were:\n\n* Does the meter work properly\n* How the fuck does zone focus work on this thing\n* How do photos look with flash during golden hour and blue hour (my fave time to shoot with flash)\n\n![the trail to IJAMs crag in Knoxville, TN ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R5NsEOakjk5QraeHHxMns.jpeg?height=3204&width=2136)\n\n![my good friend Cai posed for a picture for me at the bottom of our favorite wall at IJAMs ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uIK7r3k2mR5ghvLV8kAGI.jpeg?height=2660&width=2128)\n\n![practicing with flash; caught my friend John off guard a little ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DL6qoEkNIh57PpLijdGGR.jpeg?height=2640&width=2112)\n\nOverall I was very happy with my quick first roll through this camera. When I did get the focus right, the lens is very sharp, and the in-camera meter worked really well for most of the scenes I shot. This was incredibly encouraging because the main reason I purchased this camera was to have something that was easy to use for quick snapshots but still capture high quality images. The fact that I was able to do this on my FIRST roll with the camera was the indicator that I needed. I already felt that this camera was going to be the perfect addition to my kit. I definitely did not shoot many great images on the first roll, but that is totally okay. Like I mentioned at the beginning, making great images was not my main focus. I just wanted to make sure the camera worked. However, I do want to share my favorite failures from the first roll and what I learned from them.\n\n![my favorite failures from my first roll ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-lTOskX4Wj-uHVYk6w884.jpg?height=800&width=617)\n\nThe main issue that I knew I would have with this camera lies within the zone focus mechanics. Most 35mm point and shoots have an autofocus system, but I have never found a point and shoot that has an autofocus that cooperates with the way that I typically shoot. The XA2 has a zone focus, which means I have to manually select the focus. There are three focus ranges to choose from: 1 meter to 1.5 meters, 1.2 meters to infinity and 2.5 meters to infinity. Lots of overlap, lots of confusion for me. I didn’t know what was going to work for what types of scenarios. This has been the hardest part for me to understand and get right, especially on roll one. On the top image, I chose the closest zone (1 meter to 1.5 meters) and it was a little out of focus. The middle focus option would’ve been the better choice. For the bottom image, I accidentally left it on the middle zone (1.5 meters to infinity). I figured this would be okay since **technically** it should focus all the way to infinity right? Nope!! I know this now. I was very excited about both of these images so I was pretty bummed when they were out of focus, but thats why I set low expectations for the very first roll. I can only exceed them at that point.\n\nAll in all, very impressed with the camera and how quickly I got the hang of shooting it. It fit the task I had given it, and I was excited to continue to improve my abilities with it.\n\n### Test Roll Two\n\nThis past Thursday I found myself testing positive for Covid.. after a few days cooped up in the house I decided it was time for a walk. My neighborhood doesn’t have a lot of foot traffic so I figured my chances of coming into contact with someone was pretty slim. I also wanted to shoot one more quick test roll on the XA2. After the first roll I felt as if I had a great understanding of the camera and I wanted to shoot one more quick roll before I shot any serious work with it or shot any color film (its expensive!!). \n\n![a patch of flowers in a field near my house ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m3Frt1oqHRksAtDBt7chg.jpeg?height=1682&width=2523&&&size=medium)\n\nI went out to shoot around 2/3 pm so the sun was still very bright. I figured this was a great chance to test out how the in camera light meter did with direct sunlight and high contrast situations. I also needed to try my luck with the zone meter again, especially with photos in that weird range between 1.5 meters and 2.5 meters. I wasn’t expecting much from this roll. I was sick and just needed to get out and take a walk and put the XA2 through some final little tests. However, I was really happy with few images from the roll. The above image of the little flower patch tucked into the tall grass was my absolute favorite. The flowers are glowing and it really separates them from the grass in the background, exactly the kind of look I was going for when I shot the image. Gonna share a few more of my favorite images below, really snagged a lot of photos I was happy with :) \n\n![testing the XA2's meter in a high contrast situation ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sBQF0FicdAA0R-8IeJGqk.jpeg?height=2144&width=3312&&&size=medium)\n\n![southern suburbia // the XA2's meter really did well with these scenes ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1uAINfQ3x3sH9oza5CtUy.jpg?height=898&width=1432&size=medium)\n\n![getting the hang of zone focus ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/edpaoHavPgc23YcyEsmm9.jpg?height=619&width=800&size=medium)\n\nI did not even shoot a full roll of 35mm but I feel as if I totally got the hang of all the techniques I struggled with on the first roll. The learning curve for this camera is so minimal, I am very impressed. One of the only cameras I have gotten great results with almost immediately. Plus, I have not even shot any serious work with the camera. Thus far it has only been casual test rolls, I am beyond excited to start experimenting and making lots of work with this camera. \n\nThe meter behaves exactly as I would expect it to when shooting high contrast scenes. The first image is a really good example of that. Shadows are quite dark but I was still able to get a lot of detail despite that. This is especially important to note for when I am taking portraits in similar lighting conditions and may need to add some extra light to my subjects face. The meter also nailed the exposure for the suburban scenes. The sky did not get overexposed and all the darker areas of the photo still have lots of detail as well. The balance is absolutely perfect. Also, when shooting with color film I will be able to get even more detail in the darker areas, so I am very excited to put a few rolls of color film through this camera. \n\nI also nailed the zone focus with this camera finally. I made a few mistakes still, but I am very proficient with the focus mechanics now. The focus mechanics give me a lot more confidence than I normally have with an autofocus point and shoot, so I will be using this camera a lot more than I have used my point and shoots in the past! \n\n### Closing Thoughts \n\nThe XA2 was the perfect purchase for me, it fits right into my shooting process and has already produced great images for me in a casual setting. I think this will help me make more photos and shoot more often! This is the camera I needed to revitalize my shooting process and get me excited to make new work again. Sometimes all you need is a new camera, so if you’re thinking of buying one.. DO IT!\n\nIt has been a lot of fun to walk through my shooting process this way, and I am very excited to see how this blog style format evolves for me. If you made it this far, thank you so much! I have always enjoyed writing but it has not been something that I practice often. But, I am determined to write a few of these each month. It is helpful for me to think about photography like this and I love utilizing mirror and the blockchain in this way.

Maybe your busy is just lazy.\nWhen I first entered new Oriental, my one hour class fee was 140 yuan. Don't think it's too much. Just listen to me.\nThe tuition fee for students is 650 yuan per hour.\nAt that time, I just graduated. In order to make a living, I began to live ten hours a day. From sitting in the classroom at 8:30 in the morning to coming out at 9:00 in the evening, it is often a whirlwind.\nI work hard in class and speak fast. In order to enable students to receive the maximum amount of information in the shortest time, I often beat chicken blood. Sometimes I am afraid of sleepiness and even don't eat at noon.\nThere is no doubt that the mobile phone must not be turned on during class.\nBefore my parents called, they asked me if it was convenient for me? I said it was convenient, so I called; I have almost no time for friends to ask me. Many friends go farther and farther; No time for physical examination, the body is getting worse; The most interesting thing is that my girlfriend let me choose: ten hours a day or me.\nI said, how can you let me choose like this.\nShe said, do you choose.\nI hurriedly said, choose you.\nThe next day, I went to class for another ten hours.\nIn fact, in the end, I attributed the reason why we broke up to being too busy. I was too busy all day long to entertain and improve myself. I was too busy to spend time with my friends and her.\nHowever, until today, I have said goodbye to the crazy class state at that time. In retrospect, I was not busy, but lazy.\nI am too lazy to deal with work and interpersonal relationships, to change my life state, and to think about why I am so busy.\nLater, two other teachers and I resigned from New Oriental. We started our business together. That year, we had nothing, three people, three mouths and three hearts. Because we have reduced the intermediate steps, we have reduced the tuition fees of students. We find our own platform, prepare lessons collectively, recruit students, and then give lectures. Everything is not very tired. However, we have a lot of time to be liberated. The most important thing is that our salary is not only not less, but also several times more than before.\nNow, we have set up the CET-4 and CET-6, and have created a public welfare class with 199 yuan and 120 class hours, and all teaching materials are mailed. There are more and more students enrolled. There are more than 10000 students a month. As for ourselves, the salary has not decreased. The most important thing is that we have been liberated a lot of time and are not so busy.\nThere is an old Chinese saying, it's called busy and needy.\nIt means that the poorer the busier the busier. Those who are thinking and planning every day are the masters of life. They will not become slaves of the years. They will be led away by others all day and get tired.\nOn the contrary, those who have no time to plan and are unwilling to change are busy and tired. Busy is just lazy to think about why you are so busy, lazy to struggle with how to change the state of life, lazy to plan the next step.\nThink of your friend Jingjing.\nShe was a hard-working woman who never worked overtime after work and adjusted her work life very well.\nBut a few days ago, she broke up suddenly.\nShe constantly fills her life with work. She works overtime until 11 o'clock every day, dragging her tired body to work. She reduces social activities and even refuses the League building of her colleagues.\nLater, she made herself very tired, and her friends became indifferent to her one by one.\nWhen I saw her, she had acne all over her face and her eyes looked like giant pandas. She kept complaining about how busy I was.\nI said, you are just lazy.\nShe said, why do you say so? Do you know how hard I work.\nI said, you are too lazy to socialize, too lazy to think about why you broke up, and too lazy to face the feelings you lack in your heart.\nShe was stunned.\nLater, she finally began to socialize. She was not so tired. At a party, she found a boyfriend.\nThen again, the less busy state was restored.\nNow, occasionally I can ask her for tea.\nIn this world, there is a thing called the temperature of life. When you do something to the extreme and boring, have you ever thought that you are actually killing your love for it? When you are too tired and too busy, have you ever thought about changing your mind and direction to walk or take a rest, so that your efficiency will be higher.\nBeing dragged along by life all day, like being wound up, gradually forgets the power of thinking, and then forgets the reason for starting.\nLife is like this. In fact, you can slow down and enjoy the scenery around you. Perhaps it is more difficult to relax and make people comfortable than to get busy.\nPlan well and run again. Don't be lazy in thinking and planning. You will get nothing but fatigue in the end.", "timestamp": 1654529758, "digest": "Ur51KoPoydCUdy0wPnSIX6nUmpnadWeM53GdGI-Qj1Y", "contributor": "0xA559B99FFf2088750CA474D6001ec0E95DE5e63A"}

{"id": "uTYhNP7sxIPHjGLjzJL2wzxoH6DucPJZwI4SME76Ops", "title": "Introversion is not a mistake, but a gift from God", "body": "I am an introvert. When I was young, my mother said that before I was five years old, I had never taken a step alone. Every time I met a stranger, I kept hiding; After school, from primary school to middle school to college, I never liked the lively scene. I would rather sit quietly with a book in my hands; After work, I prefer to be alone on weekends and holidays in addition to necessary social activities at work. Even now, every weekend, I like to stay at home, reading, writing, learning, baking, taking photos... Immersed in my own world. I especially like the feeling of retreating from the crowd and being alone with myself. For introverts, immersion in their own world is a pleasure.\nHowever, I also know very well that while I enjoy my own world alone, I am also troubled by my own personality (I believe most introverts will have such a worry). After all, modern society is in such a value system as \"extroverted and ideal\", and all people hope that they are talkative and cheerful when they get along with others. Introverts live under the influence of extroverted ideality, just as women live in a male dominated social value form, their own value is greatly reduced.\nSo, many times, I began to force myself to change and make myself more outgoing. In the years after graduation from University, I have been engaged in media work, which requires skilled communication skills and strong writing skills. My specialty is writing, but communication is my weakness. But work is work. You must overcome your weaknesses. I still remember the anxiety and entanglement before I made an appointment with someone (especially the interviewee) every time when I was at work. Facing the phone, I have recited my lines over and over, but I still dare not pick up the phone and dial the number. Now I think, the reason why I was so afraid was that I was afraid of being rejected.\nI have to say that the experience of media work in recent years has really made me grow up a lot. When dealing with all kinds of people outside, I know how to deal with and deal with them. I even feel that my working experience in the media has made some corrections to my character, adding some \"extrovert\" factors to my character.\nWhen necessary, I will become very extroverted, and even pretend to be an extrovert and very successful. During the job interview, almost every interviewer will ask \"how do you evaluate your character?\" \"Are you an introvert or an extrovert?\" And so on. I believe that no one will be proud to say that he is an introvert. On the contrary, most people will say that he is an extrovert, or that he is half introverted and half extroverted. As we all know, modern workplace work needs teamwork, initiative, communication and leadership. The characteristics of introverts almost run counter to these workplace elements. In the eyes of most people, introverts are silent, not very confident, and dare not be frank about their ideas.\nHowever, even if you disguise yourself, you have to admit that the introverted gene in your bones cannot be changed. I can cheat others, but I can't cheat my true self.\nSince he was born to be an introvert, is it also doomed that he cannot have an absolute advantage in the workplace, and is it also doomed that the road of life is mediocre? No, No. I have read some biographies of literati, and I have also learned the stories of successful people in other fields. I am deeply surprised that many successful people are fundamentally introverts. Van Gogh, Maugham, Proust, George Orwell, Mother Teresa, Buddha, chendanyan, Li Na, Zhang Yining... The loneliness brought by introversion makes them know how to communicate with their own thoughts in the depths of their souls and find treasures in that quiet world.\nIf genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, generally speaking, we tend to worship the 1% part. We love its brilliance and its sparkle like a star, but the really great power exists in the 99%. What kind of magic does loneliness have? In many fields, only when you are a person can you really devote yourself to the 99% deliberate practice, which is the key to achieving outstanding achievements.\nI have come to realize that introverts and extroverts have no advantages or disadvantages. Each character is accompanied by luck and pain. You should recognize your own character, and then give full play to the advantages of this character.\nSusan Kane from the United States is a real introvert. She wrote a Book Quiet: the competitiveness of introverts. In this book, she tells us what advantages introverts have through a large number of character interviews and psychological experiments:\n\"Introverts are often attracted by the thoughts and feelings of the inner world, while extroverts tend to pay attention to people's external life and activities. Introverts tend to focus on their meaning of the things around them, while extroverts will devote themselves to events. Introverts will charge themselves when they are alone, while extroverts will charge themselves when social activities can not meet their needs.\"\n\"Introverts are slower and purposeful in dealing with problems. They prefer to devote themselves to one thing for a period of time, which makes them more focused. Such people tend to be relatively indifferent to the temptation of money and fame.\"\n\"Introverts are not the same as hermits or world weary people. Introverts may have hermit complex, but most introverts are friendly and prefer a peaceful environment.\"\n\"Introverts do a good job in formulating and implementing plans. They will strictly follow the plans.\"\n\"Introverts seem to think more carefully than extroverts. Extroverts are more likely to take some quick ways to solve problems, replacing accuracy with speed. With the progress of the task, they will make more and more mistakes. When the problem seems to become more and more troublesome, they may become deserters. Introverts will think about it before taking action, and fully digest the information they have obtained, even if they spend time on the task For a longer time, they will not give up easily, and they will finish it more accurately. \"\n\"Introverts are also very different in managing their attention: if they are allowed to act at will, introverts tend to sit down and think about things, imagine things, recall the past, and even make plans for the future, while extroverts focus on the things around them. It can be said that extroverts are paying attention to 'what' while introverts are asking 'what will happen'.\"\n\"Introverts tend to remain rational when all the people around them are irrational. Self denial is one of the biggest assets of introverts.\"\n……\nAs an introvert, I can feel these advantages: tenacity, focus, insight, thinking... More importantly, I began to appreciate and use these advantages that only introverts have. In fact, sometimes, many extroverts also want to have these advantages of introverts. A friend of mine is a typical extrovert, but every day she has to force herself to sit at her desk and practice calligraphy for an hour to exercise her concentration and endurance. She thinks this is what she lacks.\n\"In fact, the biggest challenge faced by introverts is to face up to and make full use of their own advantages. You may be busy making yourself behave like a warm and open extrovert all day long, avoiding your own talents, and eventually being despised by others. But when you fully devote yourself to the things you care about, you will find that your energy is infinite. So, please keep your nature, if you like to step by step Steady play, then don't be influenced by others and force yourself to accelerate. If you like deep exploration, you don't have to ask yourself to pursue breadth. If you prefer single tasks to multiple tasks, stick to your position. Only by sticking to your own path can you bring unlimited power. This is the result of introverts' independence from the world. \"\nWhen I was in college, our counselor said that ten years later, those who look the least impressive in college may become the best. At that time, I didn't think so. Now, if those taciturn people in the university can find their own right direction and approach it step by step according to their own rhythm, it's not surprising that they will be a blockbuster ten years later.\nThe secret of life is to put yourself under the right light. For some people, the light that suits them is the spotlight on Broadway. For people like me, a green light is enough. I like reading and writing. These are the advantages given to me by God - when others get together to sing K, go shopping and have fun, I prefer to spend an afternoon polishing my thoughts and practicing my writing. I like baking and making desserts. I have enough patience and perseverance to study and experiment until I make my own delicious food. I enjoy the feeling of being immersed in doing what I like from morning till night. I even like to sit in a coffee shop and do nothing to make myself think aimlessly\nDo what you like to do, do meaningful things, study hard and think deeply. For introverts, this is the most correct way to live.", "timestamp": 1654529975, "digest": "R1nH0cyMEP30WC-wMFy_Rl413IFhW5z4nWTKxZW9Zvs", "contributor": "0x0881b67Ad02b930dCf005431C7472e681cc67Ef6"}

He only spent energy on \"valuable problems\".\nIn terms of learning knowledge, he knows what to avoid and what to abandon. He doesn't like reading in general. He doesn't think that the more books he reads, the better. He only selects the books he has problems to study. Although he hasn't established a closed and huge philosophical system, his heroic and brilliant prose, maxims and aphorisms have deeply conquered me.\nDon't waste your energy on unnecessary things. It's the best way to achieve a person. It's also a luxury bag to relieve your tired heart from getting hurt. I think so.\nI think the waste of energy is reflected in the work, which is easily disturbed by irrelevant matters; Reflected in life, it is clearly beautiful that so many people have to struggle with themselves; Reflected in interpersonal relationships, it is to entertain strangers with kindness that should have been used to treat relatives; Reflected in the feelings of men and women, it is to abandon self realization and fall into the conjecture of whether he loves me or not.\nPeople's energy is limited. Negative emotions, subjective assumptions, trivial matters and frequently ringing mobile phones, like the Eight Power Allied forces, share precious, scarce and gone time and energy.\nMany people's calloused nerve endings are not aware of the energy consumption, because these things are too taken for granted and used to. If you are tired and feel hurt, you should try to clean up some bugs that take up the toilet and the memory slowdown.\nPeople with great energy will take the initiative to avoid interference.\nIn the past five to six years of my work, my previous bosses and colleagues have given me numerous invisible plaques such as \"energy storage maniac\" and \"efficient red flag bearer\". When leaving the first company, the boss asked him to stay three times; After I parted ways with my second employer, the manager filled the vacancy with three people; Now Dianjie often praises me for my high efficiency.\nIn addition, I guarantee 3-4 books per week; I go straight to the market to buy vegetables and cook after work on most weekdays; I don't have time to go to the gym. Anyway, my three piece exercise set of elliptical machine, belly wheel and yoga mat can also help me; Even though I worked overtime in Shenzhen, I also volunteered in the reform and opening up Museum.\nMany people have asked me how to allocate my energy so well. I am shameless to conclude that my energy should not be distracted by unnecessary things. Concretely speaking:\nSet the Taobao website as a restricted site, and do not buy online during working hours;\nWhen doing important tasks that require high concentration of attention, turn the mobile phones to flight mode;\nWhen passing by the tea room, mom's help and dating groups gather to chat, they should not stay long;\nIn my spare time, I do what I like to do. The accumulated positive energy is the hard inflation for me to overcome all hardships.\nMinimize ineffective input at work\nIn the workplace, people who really live more have no time to shout tired!\nI have a good female colleague who complained to me that she was either paralyzed by work tasks without flow, or tortured by interpersonal relationships that people know but don't know, or killed her brain cells by a small script that she directed and acted by herself.\nHowever, when I passed her computer, I saw that there was a Taobao web page that had not been closed in time. Sometimes, I had to return the color difference between the bought baby and the picture. I had to play games with the store owner and contact the express for an afternoon; After she went to the toilet, she came out to wash her hands. When she went in, the person in that room flushed the toilet. She struggled for a long time whether she flushed or not; I ran into the big boss of the group before the meeting, and was very upset because it was unnatural to say hello; Her mobile phone, which is not set to silent mode, ticks all day long. She picks it up and puts it down in a cycle. If the task is not completed, she can only work overtime.\nI often find that the same group of people who brush Taobao during working hours, think about things, receive express delivery, do chores, talk about things at leisure and complain about why they don't increase their work; Those who emphasize accumulating contacts and playing office politics are also worried about the medical examination form of the third senior high school, while lamenting the depth of the workplace and the warmth of human relations.\nSocial apps like shredders cut chunks of time into fragments. The news that pops up on the web page habitually makes the spirit spread. It is even more meaningless to study leaders' preferences and colleagues' gossip. Other people's wealth will not give you half a cent for no reason, and they will not ask you for power or power. Each leader should study how to be a business expert. The story that gossip colleagues have learned all day will make the personality to be an editor of bosom friend?\nIn my opinion, if you improve your professionalism and sense of occupation, you should not throw in the quasi sunk costs, and only those who concentrate can get a golden job.\nDon't cry because you miss the sun, or even the stars will be missed.\nIn those years, I failed in the college entrance examination and was not admitted to the school I secretly loved. At that time, he encouraged himself by saying, \"if you shed tears because you miss the sun, you will also miss the moon and stars.\" and \"the sky will fall, and the people will be responsible for it.\" so he went to college.\nWhen I go to school, I often see people lamenting the failure of the college entrance examination and worrying about future employment. Amid their gloomy cries, I have already formed the angel habit of getting up at 5 a.m. to recite English and running at 7 p.m; I have done all kinds of rigorous and careful social surveys that everyone has fooled. In order to investigate the fertility views of local people, I have taken questionnaires from the family planning bureau to the streets and alleys, from gynecologists to maternity ward beds, and every data is true and reliable; I made an appointment with the school bullies to set up a science and technology project. I worked for free in the Typewriting and copying shop next to the school. I was familiar with the use of office software and hardware. I traveled half of China with the money earned from work study program when I had a holiday. After graduation, the society has not been difficult for me.\nWhen you are stuck in a setback, your misplaced energy will lead to burnout.\nSome of my good friends ended their four-year relationship because of the man's cheating. After breaking up, they drank alcohol and got gastric ulcer, and their faces were full of bags; There were some excellent schools, but they were caught taking exams for others in their junior year. The school canceled the issuance of degree certificates, which made them angry about mild depression.\nIf the former cheer up, they may meet a good feeling of catching up from behind. If the latter gathers energy and concentration, they may get a master's degree directly by taking a postgraduate exam. There are many ill fated people like Fengtang yilao and Liguang Nanfeng in this world. Sadness is an instinct. If you are sad for too long, you will put yourself in the loser Petri dish.\nFor me, self acceptance is a practice, so I simply can't bear to let myself suffer, regret, regret and helplessness. When the barren reality, ferocious faces and malicious pranks attack me, even sighing is superfluous. Turning emotional injury into energy, turning frustration into motivation and loving myself are the ultimate romance of my life.\nNietzsche said that the reason why I am so smart is that I have not wasted energy on unnecessary things, but I would like to say that I am so smart that I will not waste energy on unnecessary things.", "timestamp": 1654529842, "digest": "T3FMBfqM2hnwTfMKzlAxdaSSJ9F5AY12mS869jKKFFY", "contributor": "0x2a179511b6285D651a6d1eF9E93dd059c10D2B47"}

{"id": "oGaZJMrCHCa-MVstrQfDkrdVfsg3zpi3AiYNpz45aHQ", "title": "Degree is a fig leaf for incompetent people, while ability is the soft qualification", "body": "1、 A degree is a fig leaf for incompetent people\nFor example, in the Shuimu love affair in Tsinghua, they are even more ugly than me, and there are very few girls in Tsinghua, so they can't take turns. They are very lonely and miserable in the dormitory. It is recommended to add Chen Anzhi's wechat: caz2133 finally said that it would be good for us to sing songs to comfort each other? They began to sing. Unexpectedly, their voices together turned into a nice male duet, so they carried their guitars and performed in the Department, then in the college, and then in various colleges and universities in Beijing. Finally, they didn't even want their degrees from Tsinghua University. They threw away their degrees and continued to sing. This belongs to what I just said. They began to do what they liked. Even if I wandered all my life, I would sing.\nI quite admire this decision. Why? A degree from Tsinghua University is good, but it is nothing compared with what you like all your life. After all, a degree is just a fig leaf for incompetent people. I think you should get a university degree, but whether you go abroad or take the postgraduate entrance examination, it should be combined with your real goal in life. Otherwise, you will get a degree just to get a degree, which will be very tragic.\n2、 Ability is soft qualification\nThere are generally two kinds of qualifications in our life, which are called hard qualifications and soft qualifications. Hard qualification means that you have obtained various degree certificates. For example, if you get the degree certificate from Fudan University, it will be tougher than that from Jiangsu Normal University, including when looking for a job, but it's just a little bit. Those who get Harvard University must be tougher than those from Fudan University, but even if Harvard graduates come to New Oriental to find jobs, most of them will be rejected by us, because many people have such degrees, but do not have corresponding soft conditions, such as no work experience, no correct view of China's reality, and no correct attitude towards doing things, then you lack soft qualifications.\nWhat are the soft qualifications? It means that we have accumulated our own life experience, wisdom and knowledge in the struggle of our life. This time you will not get a degree, but you will find that your knowledge and realm are higher than others. This is soft qualification, that is, your real ability.\nWhen a person is truly capable, others can see it. From your eyes, from your actions, from your speech, from your language, from your state of doing a small thing, others can immediately judge whether you are capable or not.\n3、 Management logic of Tsinghua MBA toilet cleaning\nLet me give you a small example and you will understand. Last week, an MBA student from Tsinghua University came to New Oriental to apply for a job. During the interview, I only asked him one question, and I said, \"please tell me in one second what is the most handy thing you can do and will do well.\"\nAfter thinking for a minute or two, he finally told me, \"Miss Yu, what I'm good at is communicating with people.\"\nI said, \"you haven't spoken to me for two minutes. Are you good at communicating with others?\"\nThen he said, \"MBA is comprehensive management. My comprehensive management ability is very strong. I know human resources, market, marketing, public relations, logistics and administrative logistics. I can do whatever you want me to do.\"\nI said, \"sorry, I can't use you, because I know from what you just said that you can't do anything.\" When a man says he can do anything, he can do nothing.\nIn fact, what I really want to hear is this sentence: \"Teacher Yu, can I help you clean the toilet?\" I think if the MBA of Tsinghua University has the courage to say so, I will be shocked by my heart. I will clean the toilet for him. If I gave him two toilets and he cleaned them very clean, I would be deeply moved. It is great and amazing that a person with such a good degree can clean the toilets so calmly.\nIf in the end, the MBA from Tsinghua University cleans the New Oriental toilet so clean that I dare to drink the water in the urinal, how do you think I feel. I will promote him immediately and give him four toilets. What will I give him when he cleans the four toilets extremely well?\nCertainly not eight toilets. Students, the truth in the world is always from quantitative change to qualitative change. After his four toilets were cleaned, I would certainly let him take charge of the other toilet cleaners, and he became the Minister of health of the New Oriental toilet. This is the management position. Don't forget.\nThen when he takes care of these people, what will I do? I will give him the New Oriental logistics system. Then if he manages the logistics system of New Oriental well, I will give him both the logistics and administrative systems, and specially appoint him as the vice president of logistics administration of New Oriental, the third leader of New Oriental.\nIf one day I accidentally lose my pigtail, isn't the president his? Right? That's how you become president. It doesn't mean you want to be president. Therefore, you should say in one second, what I am best at, what I am most capable of, and what I will definitely achieve after I do it.\n4、 It's a journey to just go\nWhen it comes to extreme situations, you don't have to wait until you have money if you really want to do something. For example, many students want to travel, thinking that I want to become a millionaire, and then start traveling. Actually, it's not necessary. If you really want to be the most famous Traveler in the world, you can start walking tonight. Carry your backpack, take a bowl, take a stick, and walk in obscurity. We have never heard of beggars who starve to death, really not.\nWhat would you do if you wanted to be smarter? A press conference was held to tell the media that from today on, as a student of Fudan University, I will stop studying. I decided to beg. I want to go from Shanghai to Lhasa.\nI think the media will follow up and report on how Fudan University Students beg to go to Lhasa. When you go to Lhasa, you will become the most famous expert in begging in the world. The United States will immediately issue you a visa and invite you to beg from Alaska to Florida.\nYour life is so brilliant. After you wait for ten years to finish eating, the ten-year begging and wandering diary will become a world-famous best seller, and you will become a millionaire. Life is so brilliant.\n5、 A master who studies Chiang Kai Shek\nAnother extreme example comes from a college classmate of mine who did research on Chiang Kai Shek. Somehow he fell in love with studying Chiang Kai Shek. From the 1980s to 1995, he was down and out. His only job is a teacher in the English Department of Peking University. He gets oneortwo hundred yuan a month.\nHowever, by 1995, the New Oriental School had become quite good. I invited him to the New Oriental School for classes. He said: No, it would take me hours to prepare for classes when I came to class. It would take me hours to attend classes. It would be a waste of my time studying Chiang Kai Shek. I thought he was like this all his life. He was down and out with Chiang Kai Shek's book.\nNo matter what kind of knowledge, it will be appreciated to a certain extent. By 1995, he had become superb in this field. As a result, the United States held a seminar on Modern Chinese history and invited him to make a keynote speech. When he spoke, he moved an old professor below. This professor has studied Chiang Kai Shek for 30 years, but there is no one in the United States to talk about Chiang Kai Shek. Unexpectedly, a fool in China has also studied Chiang Kai Shek for 15 years. Now the professor is happy.\nAfter the meeting, the two men wept bitterly for Chiang Kai Shek. Finally, the old professor said: I need you to stay in the United States and do research with me. It is recommended to add chenanzhi's wechat: caz2133, a professor, gives him 50000 US dollars of research funds every year and receives his wife from China to the United States. This friend of mine has been studying with this professor at St. John's University since 1995. When I went to St. John's University in the second half of 1999, he had already graduated. He stayed at St. John's University to teach. He had already bought a small house and an old car on Long Island, new York. His wife was with him, gave birth to a child and kept a dog at home. Pointing to all this, he told me: look, Chiang Kai Shek gave me all this.\nAs long as you don't make any mistakes and can write oneortwo books, you can continue to be a professor in an American University. The annual income is not high, but $40000 is enough for him to live. I thought he would be a professor there all his life and study modern Chinese history. Unexpectedly, when Shanghai Oriental satellite TV recruited the chief planner of Chinese and Western cultural programs two years ago, it poached my classmate and gave him a very high salary, nearly onemillion yuan. Why hire him at such a high salary? The reason is simple. Isn't learning from the essence to the depth, and then from the depth to the universality?\nTo study Chiang Kai Shek, you have to study Mao Zedong. To study Mao Zedong, you have to study modern Chinese history. To study modern Chinese history, you have to study modern Chinese history. How did modern Chinese history come from? It comes from the modern world history. The modern world history comes from the American War of independence, the French bourgeois revolution, and the British charter movement. All these come from the Renaissance and the enlightenment, which in turn comes from the ancient Greek and Roman civilization, which comes from the ancient Egyptian and Indian civilizations.", "timestamp": 1654530189, "digest": "caq6YdA1YPdCpjcqg-defIwngDUWZFApYzeaeztYGIs", "contributor": "0x8f8B8EC264da7b1b1FC7791DE3B118de1ED0B739"}
{"id": "PrzcDyg1Yg-OARATwKKs3_gtLZLB81KmwwA2a7hQZS4", "title": "We are not afraid of failure. We are adding to our success", "body": "Failure is a step towards success\nIf you only get full after eating 10 dumplings, is it the 10th dumpling that makes you full? Of course not. If satiety is regarded as a goal of success, eating the first, second and third dumplings, and even eating the ninth dumpling, fails to achieve the goal of \"satiety\". From the appearance, it seems that eating the first nine dumplings is \"eating for nothing\", which is a \"failure\" action again and again, because the successful goal of \"satiety\" has not been achieved. In fact, every time you eat one of these 10 dumplings, it is a step closer to \"satiety\" and a step closer to the goal of success. It is not the \"10th dumpling\" that makes you satiety step by step.\nLiaorongdian, President of American international investment consulting company, has a similar view when talking about how to deal with the failure in marketing. In his opinion, if you meet 10 customers and only get an order of 200 yuan from the 10th customer, how do you view the failure and rejection of the previous 9 times? He said: \"please remember, the reason why you earn 200 yuan is because you met 10 customers. It is not the 10th customer that makes you earn 200 yuan. Instead, it should be seen that each customer makes you do a business of 200 ÷ 10=20 yuan. Therefore, the income of each rejection is 20 yuan.\nIn fact, Mr. liaorongdian is telling us that failure is not all heavy work or meaningless. As long as we look at failure with a positive attitude, failure can also bring us gains, because for any success, every previous failure is a step and a leap towards success.\nFailure is a near success\nIn our imagination, failure is the opposite of success. Failure is insulated from success. In the ruins of failure, it is impossible to find the gold of success.\nSince the invention of plastic in 1868, it has become the final conclusion that plastic is an insulator. It was not until the end of the last century that professor Allen, an American scientist, invented conductive plastic, which broke this century old conclusion. Professor Allen also won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2000.\nHow did professor Allen invent conductive plastic? In 1975, professor Allen went to Japan for academic exchanges. In the corner of a university laboratory, professor Allen found a pile of waste plastic. The Japanese professor told him that it was the waste left by a student when he failed in his experiment. Professor Allen took this pile of waste that others thought was useless back to his country for research. Once, professor Allen added a small amount of iodine to this pile of waste products. Unexpectedly, its conductivity was increased by 1000 times, becoming a conductor plastic with excellent performance, thus breaking the traditional thinking that \"plastic cannot conduct electricity\" and shocking the world.\nThis is a waste product left by a failure. Professor Allen just added a little iodine to this pile of waste products, and the nature has changed fundamentally, from insulator plastic to conductor plastic, from useless waste products to valuable treasures. Professor Allen unexpectedly excavated the gold of success from the ruins of failure. Who can say that failure is not a conductor to success?\nFailure is not fixed. Failure is not insulated from success. Failure is just a success with a slight difference in temperature. For example, when you heat 1 degree water to 99 degrees, it seems that you are \"failed\" because you have not changed the state of water. Water is still liquid water. But at this time, as long as you add another firewood, add another fire and raise the water by another degree, the state of water will change fundamentally, From a liquid to a gas. The same is true of life. Failure is not the final conclusion, nor is it the end of life. At this time, you just need to add a little more enthusiasm, confidence and courage. The little more enthusiasm, confidence and courage you add will be like the little iodine professor Allen added to waste plastic, making failure a conductor to success, and finally connect with success, Light up the glory of life.\nWhen you are in the midst of failure, please don't forget professor Allen's experiment, and don't forget a definition of life that professor Allen's experiment has summarized for us: failure is a success that is a little short of fire, and failure is a kind of conductor leading to success.\nTolerating failure is a path to success\n\"If you don't want to make mistakes, do nothing.\" 3M multinational company in the United States regards failure as a learning process, allows employees to make mistakes, allows employees to fail, and regards employee failure as a part of job innovation. It is precisely because 3M has a cultural environment that tolerates failure that it has stimulated the infinite creativity of its employees. On average, the company obtains two patents every day, and about 500 new products are launched every year, making the company stand out in the fierce competition.\n\"Reward failure not only rewards success.\" It is the \"policy agenda\" of General Electric Company. Once, a 20million dollar investment plan of the company failed due to unpredictable market factors, but the manager in charge of the plan was still promoted. Each of the 70 employees participating in the plan was rewarded with a video recorder.\n\"Today you cost the company $250million. I just hope you can do better tomorrow.\" In 1998, a software developed by Microsoft was recalled after it was found to have major defects on the market, causing a loss of 250million US dollars to the company? Gates did not criticize the manager in charge of the project, but gave him love and encouragement. Because of bill? Gates tolerated the failure of his subordinates, so that these subordinates had the opportunity to \"make up for their mistakes\" and created countless $250million worth for the company.\nOnly those who lie down forever will not fall down, and the ship that never gets into the water will not capsize. Failure is a part of success, failure is a process to success, and tolerance of failure is the channel to success. If you always want to \"block\" failure, there will be no way to success.", "timestamp": 1654530059, "digest": "rNpOq76BE8arg1aUlFoeH56A7CCxJT4yH_b_qlPCH0A", "contributor": "0xed1B26886Ab4bFae5056E7a2d4E50467025E34C2"}

Free to use, at gas cost. Platforms (option #1) does not need to consider a factory because all NFTs use one, shared, smart contract. Artists / Albums need a permissionless NFT Factory for musicians to create new Album / Artist NFTs. Ethereum must be supported, as well as having networks for experimentation such as Polygon Mainnet, Sepolia testnet,  Goerli testnet & Mumbai testnet.\n\n### Deployment Pattern - Proxy vs Standard\n\nTransactions on Ethereum Mainnet are expensive. Deployment of large, feature-rich, smart contracts is expensive. Proxy contracts are less expensive to deploy. “Proxy contracts” are a pattern of deploying a, smaller, “proxy contract” to save state and interact with the, feature-rich, “implementation contract” while being controlled by the “proxy admin contract”.\n\nFor musicians using Zora Drops or Manifold, you don’t actually own the logic contract. You own a “proxy” that’s interacting with the core [Zora](https://etherscan.io/address/0x478dc357913ec31b5015cbad60c8ddedff6299c1#code) / [Manifold](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4e4003afe3765aca8149a82fc064c0b125b9e5a#code) implementations. Maybe this is sufficient. However, proxies make me ask questions:\n\n* who controls the “proxy admin” contract?\n* how can the “implementation contract” change over time?\n* what would the gas cost be if I just deployed the base contract myself? without a proxy?\n\nThe alternative to proxies is to just deploy your own, non-upgradeable, copy of the base contract. I don’t know any easy examples of this today. That’s what I’ll be building today. If you know any examples of permissionless NFT factories that deploy a non-upgradeable contract let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sweetman_eth) or [lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/sweetman.lens).\n\n### Why I choose to lean away from Proxy here.\n\nSimple is best.\n\nI want to build this codebase as simple as possible. If someone wants to take this and add Proxy deployment to save gas. Feel free. This code should be very easy to tweak to leverage the proxy pattern. Myself, I see creating simple, verified, contracts on Polygon, Arbitrum & other L2 scaling ecosystems are the future for the creator economy.\n\n## What we’re building today\n\n* NFT Factory - `createAlbum.`\n* RaibowKit - make web3 fun.\n* indexer (optional) - I don’t think I’ll get here today.\n* Lens Protocol - something I’m thinking more about.\n\n![Rainbowkit](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JvuNGVY1nZGOZUoFzNZfh.png?height=2088&width=3840)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654530131, "digest": "034aMuDrkCijvqVr9IvSk0u1rMyw5ObOW-uAoDKoLfc", "contributor": "0xcfBf34d385EA2d5Eb947063b67eA226dcDA3DC38"}

I rely on this sentence to support myself. I hope it can also comfort you, \"don't be sad, what you have lost will return in another form\"—— Yixin\nRecently, I am too busy at work. I have to review my exams after work. When I am so sleepy, I feel that life is loveless. In the wechat group of test friends, everyone is the same. Before going to bed, someone always tells a few stories, and a group of people reply with a mess of symbols and expressions to relieve pressure.\nMy high school deskmate Xiaoyou is also in the group. She never tells jokes and doesn't reply \"ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha No one else knows her, but I am too familiar with that feeling. It is the same as in the classroom ten years ago.\nIn high school, Xiao you was poor at math. There are 60 people in the class. Her total score is in the top ten, but she can rank in the bottom ten in mathematics.\nAfter the math teacher repeatedly called Xiaoyou to the office and explained the problems over and over again, Xiaoyou still looked confused. Even the math teacher gave up.\nAt the end of another final exam, Xiao you looked at the failing number on the score list and silently pulled me to the playground for a run. On the red plastic track, the wind was strong, so I didn't see whether the tears on her cheeks were dried by the wind. I just remember the two people gasping in the warm and cold dry air in the early spring of the north.\nWe all hated youth at that time. Youth is too difficult. It is even more difficult for those who are poor in mathematics. It is even more difficult for those who are poor in mathematics but make progress like Xiaoyou. I know that the most sad thing for her is not the number of the students who failed, but the expression that the teacher gave up completely.\nAfter that day, Xiaoyou seems to have changed. She used to be afraid to enter the math office. She stayed there every time she went to the self-study class and begged the math teacher to explain the problems to her. She used the most stupid method - reciting formulas, doing problems, reciting formulas, doing problems, reciting formulas, doing problems\nShe brought a lunch box every day. She didn't go home for dinner before the evening self-study. All the time she saved was doing math problem sets. She had little rest after class and even trotted all the way to the bathroom. Because there are several other subjects to review, so she can only squeeze out the time after class and other people's rest time to tutor math.\nI almost forgot how I spent my high school life, but I still remember Xiao you crouching at the desk every time I entered the classroom. No matter how much we quarreled around, she was as calm as a cucumber, either staring at a pile of wrong numbered papers in front of her, or staring at another blank paper in front of her.\nIn Xiaoyou's college entrance examination results, mathematics is still a lagging subject, but she got the highest score in the three years of high school and the only passing score. For many people, this achievement at their fingertips means countless sleepless mornings and the break time when Xiaoyou sits on his seat like a sculpture.\nLater, we went to different universities. I went to graduate school in China, and Xiao you went to the United States. Our track gradually drifted away, and the connection slowly became weak.\nNot until we added wechat some time ago did I know that she changed her major from business administration to international accounting when she was a graduate student. Now she works in one of the world's four largest accounting firms and has become a certified public accountant who \"lives on numbers\".\nShe often worked overtime until the early morning. She was extremely busy, but full. She said to me: \"Do you know? Every time I look at the bright night in the city and feel the distant sound of the waves, I know that many years ago, when I was at recess, I didn't even drink enough water to save the time to go to the toilet. The time I spent doing math problems foolishly was not in vain. Fate didn't defeat me. I finally got the harvest, although I waited so long. Everything I paid for math was even lost Everything that has gone has quietly returned. \"\nI nearly shed tears for her words, because we all had many silly times, and we all insisted on being dull and desperate. Fate never gave a clear omen, nor promised a blue sea and blue sky after a storm. Fortunately, what we have lost and given has returned to life in another form.\nA girl I followed on Weibo, R_ Xu_， She looks like a lovely Lori, but she has the will of an iron man.\nFrom \"sports Xiaobai\" who could not run 400 meters when she was reading to \"fitness expert\" who could easily complete a marathon, from a weak little girl to a member of the International Karate Federation, she said that since she decided to change, only she knew the hardships and hardships along the way.\nOthers asked her why she had so much time to exercise. She admitted that she was a busy stewardess, and often came home after the plane landed in the early morning. But even so, she woke up early and rushed to the gym for exercise. She never advertised and called on a group of fans to get up early. She only said: \"even if I go to bed late in the morning, I will get up before 8 o'clock, because I don't want to live up to every good morning.\"\nIn her microblog photos, in addition to her young and beautiful figure, she also has her own hands full of blood bubbles for practice. But she never suffered from it, but took it as a way to temper her will and decompress herself. She is not an athlete, just an ordinary person, but she said, \"when I can stand up with a 40kg body carrying a 70kg barbell, what pressure can I not face?\"\nWhen a fan confessed to the hard work of fitness, her words healed many people. She said: \"don't worry about others drinking beer and eating fried chicken, while you can only eat tasteless healthy food. While others are shopping and watching movies, you are sweating in the gym. Don't be sad, what you have lost will return in another form.\"\nWhat I know is that she has a soft face like cherry blossom petals, a slim, healthy and strong body, and the sincere and warm love of countless fitness fans. In the camp of all beauties such as models, actors and singers, she is fresh and beautiful, so unique and powerful.\nSo looking at so many strong and diligent people, I quietly opened the review reference books.\nOnce we hated youth and thought it was too difficult to be young. But now, in retrospect, if there were no time for those who stayed up late to read, or those who wandered alone in a foreign land, how could we become who we are today? Although today's self is still imperfect, it is enough to support a leisurely life.\nYes, countless dear children, even if you want to wear the stars and the moon, even if you have nothing to depend on, you still have to go bravely. Don't be sad, what you have lost will return in another form.\nThose pains and heartbreaks, those tiredness and despair, have been silently remembered by fate. It doesn't have time to give you equal praise, applause, admiration and glory, but don't give up. They will always return in the way you dreamed of.", "timestamp": 1654530127, "digest": "1SfYEcuNW7ZCdIdW7ES9H1fLXfYsOVu47l2WiehNBRQ", "contributor": "0xfcE8E65e66CaB8e8a93803ff8A849059AaD8Fb0a"}

As a result, he insisted on working out for less than two weeks and announced that his plan had run aground.\nAfter reading a book, listening to a class or getting a shot of chicken blood, my brain opened wide and I decided to change. I also sent a circle of friends: I tried to meet a better self, but in the end, I only saw a more bloody self.\n……\nObviously know and want, but willful can not do it.\nWhy？\n\n 1. Because you're always hinting that you can't\n    M is a \"negative addict\", because she is always used to denying a lot.\n    When she was unhappy at work, she began to deny her work and Leadership: \"our leadership is really incompetent...\" \"this job is really like chicken ribs...\".\n    Just after the training, she began to deny the course and the teacher: \"they all say that the course is awesome, but I think there are many loopholes, such as...\", \"I think the teacher is also average...\".\n    ……\n    M seems to have developed a pair of golden eyes and always be able to keenly find the difference in life.\n    Later, the company had an opportunity to compete for an internal position. M applied for the position, and she wanted to get the position very much.\n    It is reasonable to say that according to M's qualifications and abilities, it is certainly no problem to win this position.\n    Before the competitive recruitment, m fell into the vortex of continuous Negation:\n    \"My PPT is not good enough\", \"I'm always not good at speaking\", \"I can't get along well with leaders\"\n    This time, m denied himself.\n    Later, m lost the competition in a mess.\n    Getting used to negative thinking will make you unable to see more possibilities, make you confrontational, make it easy for you to deny and criticize a lot, make your vision narrower and narrower, and make your action force weaker and weaker.\n    When you deny everything, the only thing you can deny is yourself.\n    When you deny yourself, it's hard to do anything.\n 2. Because you think too much to focus\n    Xiaopang went to a reading lecture given by a big guy. When he came back, he announced with great interest that he would start his grand reading plan.\n    According to the book list issued by the big guy, xiaopang bought most of the books in the book list, and then rubbed his hands to prepare for a big fight.\n    On Sunday night, I had a barbecue with xiaopang at Xiulin road.\n    You said, should I open a official account, xiaopang said.\n    Why do you suddenly want to set up a official account? I asked.\n    Xiaopang said that it is used to share his reading experience. XXX (the name of a big guy) said that reading needs to be shared with others so that he can absorb more.\n    Before the implementation of the reading plan, xiaopang had already thought of sharing his reading experience with the official account, which was really far sighted.\n    It's a good idea, but you have to carry out the reading plan first, and then do the subsequent things slowly, I said.\n    Xiaopang stopped talking and bowed his head and rolled the string in his hand.\n    Not yet.\n    On Tuesday night, when I was working overtime, xiaopang suddenly called me and said, \"I have another thing in mind. Should we hold an offline book club so that reading can be fun...\"\n    In a hurry, I threw out a sentence: Ya, I'd better finish reading the pile of books you bought first. Don't fix so many useless things\n    A month later, I asked xiaopang: how is your reading plan going?\n    I've just read half of the first book, but I have a new idea about reading... Xiaopang began to talk about his new ideas.\n    Alas, I really want to kneel down for this dead fat man. I have too many ideas, but the problem is, you have to do it.\n    Finally, xiaopang's reading plan went bankrupt.\n    If you know too much and don't take action, you will only be distracted and eventually deviate from your original goal.\n 3. Because you have no sense of crisis\n    Huazi finally announced that he had given up drinking, which surprised us all, because huazi once said that women and wine are the only things that can not be given up.\n    On Christmas Eve, constellation bar, huazimen company and company B had a fellowship together.\n    I don't know why, huazi and company B's D choked.\n    The two gave up the fight and decided to fight through a wine fight.\n    D. he is as strong as a cow. It is said that he can drink more than Wu Song.\n    The two began to fight over wine, and the red beer came in turn, pouring cup by cup into their stomachs.\n    The colleague was afraid that huazi would suffer losses and advised him to drink less, but once huazi's stubborn temper came up, no one could stop him.\n    Hua Zi continues to grapple with D.\n    It's true: a thousand cups of wine are too few for a bosom friend, and a fool is too drunk.\n    I don't know how long I've been drinking.\n    Later, while drinking, Hua Zi suddenly vomited a mouthful of blood and then fell to the ground.\n    This mouthful of blood finally stopped the liquor store, and almost scared the people silly.\n    My colleague hurried Hua Zi to the hospital. Upon examination, he suffered from stomach bleeding.\n    Fortunately, it's not very serious, but it needs to be hospitalized for a period of time.\n    That day, I went to the hospital to see Hua Zi.\n    His mother, it's a big game this time, Hua Zi said.\n    I teased him and said: it was a big game. People drank wine and vomited wine. You drank wine and vomited blood\n    Hua Zi smiled and hit me with his fist. He said: I really quit this time. I don't believe I can't quit. Dog day!\n    In this way, after the labor pains, huazi started his journey of abstinence again.\n    But after a while, at the dinner of several friends, I saw that huazi was still the one who drank the most.\n    Didn't you quit? I asked Hua Zi.\n    Hua Zi said: I was supposed to quit, but later I couldn't resist my friend's advice. Besides, it's OK to drink less. It's impossible to drink stomach bleeding every time. I'll quit slowly in the future\n    I will not say anything after listening.\n    After experiencing the pain of drinking, Hua Zi still doesn't regard abstinence as a thing. How can he quit?\n    Sometimes, we know that we should do something, but because these things are important and not urgent, coupled with the lack of crisis awareness, we always want to do it later, but life is short, how can there be so much later?\n 4. Because you don't know your priorities\n    It's said that I got a fitness card, and egg also got one. They said that they should hold together to keep fit, so it's easier to stick to it.\n    So I made an appointment to go to the gym for at least two hours every Monday, Wednesday and Friday evening.\n    The first week was good. The egg arrived as scheduled.\n    And every time after exercise, Yudan would send a self portrait to his circle of friends, which was very encouraging.\n    But in the second week, egg was always late, either because of something like that or because of something like this.\n    The third week, Wednesday, I didn't see him at night, so I called him and asked him where he was.\n    There was a lot of noise on the other end of the phone. The egg was panting and yelling: I'm singing K. I won't go to the gym tonight. Sorry, man\n    The fourth week, there was no egg in the gym. Call him. He was either busy or too tired to come today.\n    I have been urging more times, and I am so annoyed that I don't care about him anymore.\n    Egg's fitness program ended without any problems.\n    Fitness is very important, don't you know? He knows!\n    However, in his heart, what is more important than fitness is to let others know that he is exercising, singing K or doing other things. Therefore, fitness itself seems to be less important.\n    A thing that is not so important, who will do it with heart and strive to complete it?\n 5. Because you don't really recognize what you do\n    Your inner values do not recognize what you have done. This is the fundamental reason why you know but can't do it.\n    M don't you know that positive thinking is very important? She knows! But in her value system, being a judge is more important than being a praiser. Therefore, she can never get rid of her negative thinking.\n    Xiaopang doesn't know that reading is very important? He knows! But in his value system, enjoying the pleasure of interpersonal communication is more important than reading itself. Therefore, he is always distracted from reading.\n    Doesn't Hua Zi know that abstinence is very important? He knows! However, in his value system, face and present pleasure are more important than abstinence, so he can never really quit.\n    Values are the \"invisible hands\" in our hearts, which will dominate our judgments and actions.\n    When you really agree with what you have done, you will find ways to do it. Even if you encounter difficulties, you will take them as a companion for growth.\n    When you don't really agree with what you do, it's hard for you to do it, and there are many excuses and reasons.\n    However, knowing but not doing is not our ultimate destiny,\n    So, how can we do from knowing to doing?\n 6. Positive thinking and timely tracking\n    Stop complaining and denying, stop being a bad critic of life, and try to affirm and accept.\n    Think positively, find out more possibilities and solutions, make a plan or get a task, and think about how to complete it better, rather than what causes me to be unable to implement it.\n    Make a traceable action plan and use external supervision. For example, if you can't insist on getting up early, you can join some early rising groups and make yourself get up early by punctual clocking and peer supervision.\n 7. Simplify goals and focus on actions\n    Only by simplifying the objectives can we grasp the key points and maintain focus. For example, the annual plan can cover many objectives, but it is best to keep two or three core objectives so that we can have a definite aim; After listening to a class or reading a book, it is not necessary to remember all the contents, but to extract the most useful points for yourself, so that you can quickly absorb and act.\n    Focusing on action, we need to turn big into small and strengthen repetition.\n    Turning big into small means that you break down your big goal or long-term goal into small immediate goals. For example, your big goal is to lose 5 kilograms of weight within half a year. When the big goal is broken down to the end, you have to run for 90 minutes every day.\n    Strengthening repetition means that you can write down your goals, such as reading 100 books in 2015; Take notes frequently, for example: record your reading progress and experience; Make the goal visible, for example: arrange your reading plan into photos, and then set it as mobile screen painting; To make you always remember your goals and what to do, so as to stimulate action and persistence.\n 8. Establish crisis awareness\n    The strengthening of crisis awareness, on the one hand, comes from the understanding of one's own experience. For example, after a serious illness, people are more likely to recognize the importance of health and become able to keep exercising; On the other hand, it comes from the perception of other people's experiences. For example, when we have seen the experiences of some people in the natural disaster, it is easier to cherish the present and family affection. Of course, this is a passive way to establish a sense of crisis. To actively establish a sense of crisis, you need to know your goals and consider them at any time. For example, your goal is to earn 1million in three years, but when you earn less than 100000 in half of the time, you will naturally be worried. The same is true for health, work or other aspects.\n 9. Prioritize and act first\n    The best and most commonly used method to distinguish priorities is the four quadrant time management method, which is common and well known to everyone, so it is not repeated here. However, the premise of making good use of the four quadrant time management method is that you must clearly know your goals and be able to make choices and sequencing. Otherwise, it is difficult to distinguish priorities.\n    Action first means that sometimes we don't need to use plans to guide our actions, but use actions to drive our plans. For example, xiaopang didn't need to make a plan before he started reading. Instead, xiaopang went to read, read, slowly found his feelings, mastered the frequency and speed of reading, and then made a reliable reading plan, which is easier to achieve.\n10. Truly accept and acknowledge what you do.\n    Look for the power of role models: you can look at the elders or peers around you who do the same thing, how they do it and how they adhere to it, and find ways to do things and spiritual motivation.\n    Think clearly about the benefits of doing this: what benefits can it bring to you? For example, if you lose weight successfully: it can make your body more fit; It can strengthen your immunity and make you healthier; You can get more sense of achievement and satisfaction, So as to increase the motivation to do this.\n    Choose what you love: because you love, it is easier to insist and recognize.\n    Inner dialogue: ask yourself quietly, what exactly do I want? What are the values that have influenced me deeply? Why am I alive? Find more intrinsic motivation and power.\n    From knowing to doing is a journey from mind to foot, and it is also a one-man battle. You need to understand yourself, change yourself and defeat yourself in order to become the ultimate winner.\n    Be a man of unity of knowledge and action, you can!", "timestamp": 1654530360, "digest": "nR6c9H1btVQoP_uVhA6aKQ3oZ864_11rLM8rk1nazic", "contributor": "0x0d11b4997077322Ae43150473453475c09271b52"}
{"id": "czl-IgNROCAYKdvhZrrD8HcpfIW_R_Ab786HS_K2hiE", "title": "A beautiful failure is another kind of success", "body": "Now is an era of success studies. Many distortions and chaos in China are related to the pursuit of general success. We just pursue the results of reality, often do not pursue the truth; We attach great importance to the result, so we never enjoy the process; In order to achieve certain expectations, we often resort to all means.\nIn 2012, I participated in the coverage of the London Olympic Games. The most important sentence of the London Olympic Games is \"affect a generation\". A reporter asked, \"how does sports affect a generation?\" An official of the London Organizing Committee replied: \"sports teach children how to win.\" This sentence is very normal. In China, many things can teach children how to win, but his next sentence moved me particularly: \"at the same time, teach children how to lose with dignity and dignity.\"\nThis is an education that the Chinese lack. In our education system, when did children learn how to lose with dignity and dignity from childhood?\nI remember this sentence. On the one hand, it makes me more understand why sports play such an important role in our life; On the other hand, it is like a mirror, reflecting China at this time. Sometimes, the farther away from home, the clearer the feeling.\nIn fact, our ancestors have long understood this truth, saying that \"nine times out of ten, life is not as good as what you want.\". Since nine out of ten things are not as good as we intended, why do we never teach the mentality and coping ability of \"nine out of ten\"? Oneortwo out of ten successes are considered extremely important; Nine times out of ten, the setbacks have also been magnified to the point where nothing can be done.\nLooking back at Chinese history, including world history, think about it. Is failure terrible? There are countless historical figures in China. They are great because of failure, not because of success.\nIs Yue Fei great because of his success? From the perspective of our current \"success study\", Yue Fei is a failure. No matter how well you fought, you were recalled by others' n-way gold token, and finally you did it. In the society at that time, he was a loser. Who was the winner at that time? It's Qin Hui. But then? Qin Hui has knelt on the West Lake for many years, but Yue Fei is our hero, right?\nIs Xiangyu a winner? As a man and a general, has Xiang Yu failed beyond measure? Farewell my concubine. However, he is still a hero in Chinese drama stories and people talk about it. On the contrary, Liu Bang, the \"winner\", will make us have a certain feeling of disdain or dislike in our hearts.\nIs Lin Zexu successful in life? Everyone only remembered his success - Humen destructed opium, but they did not know that Lin Zexu was dismissed a year later under the pressure of many \"compromise groups\". In terms of officialdom at that time, was he successful? Not at all.\nWhy make up the lesson of failure? It is not only because life is not as good as you want, but also because people are a one-way street from birth, heading straight for death. Even if you win the world, you can't win the result. Death is the biggest \"failure\". How should you face it?\nFailure, in fact, has many meanings. These meanings are greater than success. Or there is a kind of success that must take failure as a driving force. Empress li of the Southern Tang Dynasty is also extremely successful in terms of failure. It is very difficult for us to experience such failure. But we still talk about him. Why? As a great literary creator, he stayed in the history of Chinese literature. If the country was not completely destroyed, would he write such a feeling as \"ask you how much sorrow you can have, just like a river flowing eastward\"? can't. This failure is painful for Empress Li, but it is a blessing for future generations and the inheritance of Chinese? In his words, failure has become a wonderful artistic conception.\nMozart, I have been to his hometown Salzburg more than once. He was not a popular person in his hometown before his death. He was repeatedly excluded and had a bad life. But he is also a genius. How talented is he? The music works he created in his life may not be completely copied by ordinary people. In his music, you can't hear failure, frustration, the wandering of life experience and all the difficult words. His music is always a beautiful existence in the world, which is a wonderful thing.\nHow many great poets have created those great works precisely because of the misfortunes, setbacks and sadness in life. We all know that Su Shi's works are excellent, but Su Shi's official career is actually very bad. He has been repeatedly excluded and relegated, but even so, he still left a masterpiece handed down from generation to generation, and even the negative emotions in life have found a unique outlet. Otherwise, where did the \"Dongpo meat\" come from? Therefore, taking history as a mirror and returning to the individual, we should know that failure is sometimes necessary and an important motivation for great creation.\nIn addition, we should also understand that setbacks and failures are originally opportunities for change. You know, people don't have to make a decision when they win, but they have to make a decision when they lose.\nThere has always been a rule in the stadium - the winner stays the same and the loser changes, right? Barcelona won the \"Treble\" this year, but if we go back to January, almost all sports fans would not expect it. At that time, Barcelona was almost finished, losing to Real Madrid, CELTA, especially at the beginning of the new year, to royal society.\nFailure is like a process of crushing the cancer. It seems that it doesn't matter to lose once, and it seems that you can still carry two defeats, but after losing to royal society, the contradictions of the whole team broke out in an all-round way: the problems between Messi and the coach, the problems of football style, and so on. At this time, the players realized the tragedy. If we don't face it seriously and make a new decision, we will achieve nothing. Harvey, who is leaving the team, wants to talk to Messi. Are you going to continue watching Ronaldo win the golden ball? Then go to mediate the relationship between him and Enrique\nFrom that defeat, the team really got on the right track and created another miracle of \"Treble\" in the history of football. If there had been no successive failures before, especially the disastrous defeat to the Royal Society, if we had won at that time, I am afraid all the problems would still exist. Lose once every few games, lose again every few games, and you may finally win the \"Treble\", but it will not reach such a great height.\nMaking a decision often means a change, which is not the case in life? Whenever failures and setbacks come, you should look at them with curiosity and try to understand their purpose: is this a reminder? Should I make a better decision?", "timestamp": 1654530409, "digest": "2ia_5sIHSZb6tMfu2UIXLyyF5dmNeL750CenMXcfmWg", "contributor": "0x3f636852812C85Db34b935086cA58eE8edADC027"}

There are many choices to face in one's life. We must learn to give up. Life is short, we will experience a lot of ups and downs, only learn to give up, then we will have a mature; Only by learning to give up, can we have that calm about life.\nIn fact, giving up is a kind of enterprising and persistent pursuit. It is precisely because it is giving up that they have been made, and it is persistence that leads them.\nCan you feel the trace of bitterness coming out of Lu Xun's pipe at the corner of his mouth? With the lofty ambition of \"I recommend Xuanyuan with my blood\", he resolutely gave up the comfortable, comfortable and elegant life he could have enjoyed, just to wake up the numb Chinese people and to realize the vision of \"the cold earth turns into spring\". His mind is vast, and Lian Guangyu never forgets to use a pen that is sharper than a knife to throw it at the enemy. Although he was in danger, he still \"looked coldly at the fingers of thousands of people\". For the pursuit of millions of people, he had no regrets and \"bowed his head and willingly became an ox\".\nPursuit, like the persistence of the old fisherman tisanga, is saturated with sweet honey in his bones. Even if the insistence on filling the sea is not rewarded, even if the snail's spirit of climbing out is not rewarded, the world will leave traces of the work that has been done, and Baiyun can also witness the tired body that once ran about because of the pursuit.\nSome people say that there are two things in the world that can not be forced: when I was a child, I was interested in learning, and when I grew up, I was in love. It is very difficult for us young people to give up a relationship. In the face of a complex society full of material desires and various temptations from all sides, the key is to eliminate the mentality of worrying about gain and loss, advance and retreat calmly, and be positive and optimistic. Several years later, when we look back on the past, maybe we will be glad that we made the right choice to give up. Maybe because of the giving up in those years, we will reach the other side of success today\nThe jar fell to pieces. Even if I looked back countless times, it would not recover. This reminded me of a wise man Gandhi. At the railway station, one of his shoes was stuck by the railway track and gave up. The other shoe was also thrown away. It was said that it could be matched into a pair after being found by others. In addition to humor, people can not help but fall into thinking and learn to give up at the right time, which is a major meaning of life.\nTo make a cup of new tea, you must pour out the old water. To get a rose, you must give up the rose in your hand. Pursuit is the most beautiful poem on the road of life. Giving up decisively is the flat tone in poetry. Giving up is just to make this poem sing more loudly in the wide world.\nIn the pursuit of abandonment, the emperor will become his great cause, and the sages will become his eternal articles. In the pursuit of giving up, the road of life will be smooth. Pursuit is the most beautiful poem on the road of life. To give up decisively is to let the most beautiful poem sing more loudly in the wide world! Life is always in the pursuit of survival. We always lament the perseverance of those who face difficulties and make continuous progress. However, a person's strength is small after all. Sometimes giving up is not a kind of survival wisdom. For example, when gecko encounters danger, it gives up its small tail to win the respect of life for itself.\nTake a step back, the sea is vast, the sky is clear, the wind is clear and the clouds are light. Learning to give up in time in the process of pursuing will make you gain more. \"Life is precious, love is more expensive. If it is freedom, you can throw away both.\" Pei Duofei expressed his pursuit in giving up. \"Since ancient times, no one has died, and his love will shine in history\". Wen Tianxiang gave up his life and his pursuit was rewarded. An innocent heart will always be known in the world, and his patriotic feelings will always be brilliant in the starry sky of history.\nIn pursuit, there can also be determination to give up, and in giving up, there can also be eternity to pursue. Pursuit is a lofty mountain, giving up is a ladder. Pursuit is a vast ocean, giving up is a sail. Pursuit is a vague dream, and giving up is the real advice to uncover the dream. Pursuit is a bottomless cliff, giving up is a blue sky on that cliff. Pursue bravely, give up decisively, and be flat on the road of life.", "timestamp": 1654530299, "digest": "n3j1h0bNDWxeDGELFeX1PBn-yR5ZJfvXTcTuAyM7800", "contributor": "0x2728ADDEB2b8EF2FC182eD79BE7eF2E7648b30e7"}

No matter how many times the boom and bust cycle happens, we never seem to learn to put the responsibility on the right people.\n\nWhile there is a lot to say about it generally, I’m here to talk about employers and their responsibility to their existing and future workers. I’ve been increasingly frustrated to see employers cede this responsibility in the most cynical and sinister forms.\n\nSpare me the regular:\n\n1. “This is the way business is, this is what we signed up for when adopting a capitalistic system“ - This might be true, but this is also a classic misdirection tactic. While capitalism discusses profit maximization, it by no means discusses society condoning irresponsible and egregious corporate behavior.\n2. “Cancelling offers is completely legal in most states“ - This is of course true, but this is the problem. We need mechanisms to penalize bad actors that take advantage of the legal system to protect their irresponsible behavior. We should also elevate and profit actors that behave responsibly and do not condone short-term thinking and blame-shifting.\n3. “The market will take care of it, it’s bad business” - Ten years ago I would have said the same, but after repeatedly seeing this is not true. Bad press coverage can be surpassed and people have short memories.\n\n## Why does this matter?\n\nTech-workers are a generally incredibly lucky group of people. Their skills are in extremely high demand and they are compensated generously for their work. Their benefits and conditions are unparalleled to other professions.\n\nThis creates a common set of misconceptions that we see refuted over and over when things turn in the economy:\n\n1. “You have nothing to worry about since your skills are in demand” - While this might be true, it doesn’t negate the incredibly high mental cost of being laid off or having your offer rescinded. Furthermore, in bad markets, it might not necessarily be easy to find a comparable job (not just money-wise, a lot of things go into job satisfaction).\n2. “This is a two-way street, you can also leave your job at any time“ - While this is technically true, it is incredibly misleading. Leaving your job doesn’t result in the corporation losing its livelihood, health insurance for you and your family, your visa (and sometimes results in you being forced out of your home), and dignity.\n3. “Corporations are required by law to maximize profits” - This is of course true, but this is the point. Shareholders don’t have to worry about mass layoffs or generally terrible corporate behavior because the company doesn’t pay a price for it. There needs to be a reputation tax to offset this.\n4. What if the corporations must lay off their workers to save themselves, should they be penalized too? When interviewing for a job, workers routinely are asked to provide background information, pass tests, and convince future colleagues and bosses that they are trustworthy. Why shouldn’t corporations have to go through the same set of hoops? If you had a justified business case for doing what you did, make it to the prospective candidates. If they request further assurances before taking the job, this is the price you have to pay (which I can guarantee you is less than the price the people you laid off had to pay).\n\n## Community-owned reputations database\n\nThe next step is always to create a centralized solution, à la glassdoor, blind, LinkedIn, level.fyi, you name it. This always follows a similar pattern:\n\n1. Mission statement and excitement - centralized service announces they are going to disrupt the market and would never be bought by foreign interests.\n2. Database and community grows - For a while, centralized service acts responsibly and advocates for workers’ rights.\n3. Centralized service is looking to monetize - Generally speaking, providing an honest and impartial platform is pretty bad business. You have all the costs associated with running the service without real monetization options.\n4. Centralized service gets acquired or sells off - Here the owners realize two things: They have valuable data. They can manipulate rankings and surpass information for a price.\n5. Repeat\n\n**The only sustainable approach is to have a worker-owned and managed database that isn’t for sale.**\n\n## What’s next?\n\nI don’t have all the answers to what comes next, but I know that something needs to be done and this is the time to do it. People never rally around these causes in good times because there doesn’t seem to be a need. Imagine the pain of your friends and countrymen that had to endure one or multiple layoffs in recent years. Imagine the pain of people that came to your country to better themselves and their children’s future to be disposed of once they weren’t needed anymore.\n\nI know one project can’t fix everything, but this is a step in the right direction. Bitcoin has changed the way we think about money, and Ethereum has changed the way we envision the web, this is the time to start using it for good.\n\nI’m writing this piece with the backdrop of the horrific shooting in Texas that took the life of 21 innocent children. I’m seeing the lack of care for human life that is shown for the sake of “freedom”.  People should have the freedom the conduct business, but they should do so with dignity and care for the other, we must keep building to ensure it happens.", "timestamp": 1654530455, "digest": "QODuEakkJ2LjojFgPCDWAy93kxjYVfENdJ-Wo6ve4Xk", "contributor": "0xCA67AA71eE852e539326625ad9D0e273Ab22d155"}

Later, I thought about that tweet again, and I realised it was right! At the time, I was designing prototypes for our web3 app, [After.](https://after.fund/)\n\nMy experience was so interesting and enlightening that I felt it could be helpful for other designers, too. So, here I will showcase my **brand-design journey**, and describe the lessons I have learned.\n\n### Preliminary research\n\nMy eye-opening research on different web3 projects brought up **a wealth of identikit brands** that reflected everything the infamous tweet describes.\n\n![Similar illustrations and font style among web3 projects websites](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Jrl6CSsOymorWTZDwDgi.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThese results also show that when it comes to branding a web3 project, designers can be somewhat clueless. This is partly because such projects tend to focus on rigid technical concepts that feel abstract and unfamiliar.\n\nOther designers simply feel **overwhelmed by the infinite possibilities at their feet.**  Consider that most of these projects live exclusively in the digital world: hence, just about anything is possible! So why is it that we keep on doing the same things?\n\n### Storytelling is the answer\n\nThis is not the first time I have talked about \"storytelling\".  That’s because for me, **storytelling is more than a buzzword.**\n\nStorytelling is my only way of working, and **the only path that leads a brand towards a strong, relatable sense of identity and purpose.** This is compounded when we consider that, most of the time, both (identity and purpose) are sorely lacking from web3 brand identities.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I will illustrate the three steps that helped create our company's story.\n\n## Lesson01. Write your story from who you are, no matter how complex the technology or intangible the project.\n\nMost web3 projects try to paint a sophisticated brand identity, often using abstract and/or futuristic illustrations and imagery (*lesson 03*), blunt typography, and neon colours to explain who they are.\n\nThis is as far as their identities go, so no wonder they all look alike.\n\nFrom experience, I understand all too well that if you can’t explain “who you are” through images, you’ll also struggle to communicate your unique identity through words (aka content, *see lesson 02*).\n\nThe task becomes even more complicated when even you don’t know why your brand exists!\n\nTo overcome this issue, the first stage in branding your next web3 project is to **define your key differentiators** (in the form of a mission, vision, values and purpose). Only then will you **create a story that allows others to understand and share your beliefs.**\n\n**After** uses the blockchain technology of smart contracts to create **an automated, transparent, immutable, and private distribution of assets** at an event-based future trigger (for example the death of a person, or a change in their Will).\n\nAnswering Marty Neumeier's questionnaire (a set of 17 questions to find the *Onliness Statement*, that cardinal distinction that can help the business owners to create a prosperous brand.), we defined that our company's mission is **to help people realise the power of wealth.**\n\nFor this reason, the main inspiration for our story derives from the keys of Pluto. According to the Orphic Hymn to Pluto, among many other attributes, Pluto owns the keys that connect with God's capacity to give humanity wealth.\n\nIn ancient Greek burial practices, the **keys** symbolised revelations that the deceased was obligated to keep secret, along with a coin placed in their mouth to ensure a safe passage into the next world.\n\nWith such rich references to draw upon, the key became an essential visual element of After's branding, while the coin became **After's utility token #OBOL.**\n\n![After brandmark](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1lEDbqUMzrvrBRm4WMmDt.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n**After's brandmark is a key**, which features a bespoke design of the capital letter A on the top. This brandmark is enclosed in a geometric hexagonal shape, representing the value of privacy and secrecy.\n\nThis sophisticated and elegant brandmark is paired with **a bespoke sans serif typeface** representing the bold encrypted structure behind creating a Will through After's platform.\n\nThe design of the capital letter above the key is also used to represent the utility token #OBOL.\n\n![#OBOL symbol and tokenomics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7AYiTtGX0_1h-DNybLFJV.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Lesson 02. Build a community through content, and project personality through fonts.\n\nIn a world that is entirely digital, such as web3, typefaces can break traditional print-rules and enjoy the freedom they deserve on-screen… where they can be the stars!\n\nUnfortunately, when they are overused, large, animated typefaces create a bustling environment that tires our eyes and drains our minds’ focus from the rightful heart of the brand’s storytelling: **content.**\n\nOne beautiful side of the de-centralised web is the **communities** that form from similarities in specific ideas, and your project’s unique values (as explained in *lesson 01*). So, the right content is critical.\n\nIf this interaction is missing, you will deprive your users of **meaningful participation in the web3 experience.** No matter how fancy and futuristic your project is, make sure your typeface is also clear, legible, and humanly expressive, so it can properly introduce your project to its users.\n\nFor **After**, we wanted to build a community whose **values could inspire future generations.** After must communicate a sense of immutability and permanence, because this is our promise to the community.\n\nOur content also reflects how After speaks to **a primal human need** (the desire to ensure a better future for our loved ones), which is powered by blockchain technology (immutability and permanence).\n\n![Organization of the content on After landing page](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pj0WuTw5eHDE-_MRYa1c3.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nOur values and duality are revealed in our specific choice of typeface.\n\nWe opted for **Frank Rhule Libre**, the digital version of a traditional serif typeface used mainly in print.  We then paired this with a modern sans serif font, **Lato**, which is exclusively designed for the digital world (though it looks good in print, too!).\n\nThe sans serif has been used in every header, to deliver essential concepts and help readers to scan the page effortlessly.\n\nLato, meanwhile, has been widely used in long paragraphs for its semi-rounded details that aid readability, as well as offering a sense of gravitas.\n\n![Some slides of our pitch deck to illustrate the usage of the typeface](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kt4Ms5XBxN853vjLjAkIH.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nStorytelling also helped us to elaborate the delicate **concept of death** in a personal and expressive way, focusing on positive legacy rather than heartbreak. For this reason, the word **\"departure\"** was chosen over “death”.\n\nOur users are referred to as **Afterists**: people who have taken control of defining a positive future for their loved ones.\n\n**After** also promises to make the **journey** towards creating a Will both pleasant and accessible – a simple process that is literally at their fingertips.\n\n## Lesson 03. Illustrate your story: create differentiation with your own visual language.\n\nColours and illustrations are powerful storytelling methods.\nHowever, if your web3 project's visual language feels similar to that of so many other projects, **how can you differentiate yourself?**\n\nAs we have already touched upon, the alarming similarity is likely due to your attempt to explain the technology behind the project (which most of the time is complicated and feels unfamiliar), rather than explaining the values and purpose of your brand.\n\nWhen illustrated with intention, **a compelling story has the power to spark conversation.**\n\nIf you explore your company's key differentiators (mission, values and purpose), you will be forced to **think creatively about your brand's unique story**, and how you can harness its competitive power.\n\nIn the case of **After**, our values inspired our colours: from the very light, like white and pink (emotion, afterlife, purity, clarity, meditation, light), to darker, more sophisticated shades like purple and black (wealth, death, meaning, passage, spiritual).\n\n![After brand colors and values associated with each color ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zqXv2o4DfhxfKWGldDAxW.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThis content (including our mission and purpose) inspired our illustrations.\n\nAs we mentioned in *lesson 02*, we used the words *journey* and *departure* to introduce and explain our app. An inspirational story, the Myth of Pluto, describes **the journey in the afterlife.**\n\nHence, I created a series of illustrations that visualise the passage of our Afterists to a world that is peaceful and everlasting, crafted from expansive architecture and infinite skies.\n\nThe illustrations are also part of **a** **non-fungible token (NFT) collection called Elysium** (from the Greek, *Ēlýsion pedion*; a conception of the afterlife developed over time by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults).\n\nThe Elysium artworks, or NFTs, will be distributed as a ‘pass’ to join the community. Only pass holders can unlock community-specific channels, or gain access to exclusive perks and rewards.\n\n![Samples of Elysium NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q1zRxx_Gl6Btv7C73z3hr.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Takeaways\n\nIn a world that changes so rapidly, storytelling can help web3 projects hold users’ attention, as they build lasting and memorable community connections. Working on our After's narrative, we learned:\n\n* Your mission, vision, values, and personality will **build your unique storytelling strategy.**\n* Your story will guide you towards choosing the right words for your content, and a typeface that clearly **expresses your ethos.**\n* Storytelling inspires illustrations that focus on the key differentiators, helping you forge **meaningful connections with your customers.**\n\n**We hope you enjoyed my designer's journey!  If you would like to start a new journey all of your own, that cares for and protects your loved ones, [you can visit After’s website to find out more.](https://after.fund/)**", "timestamp": 1654530366, "digest": "Wg9Dm5EOzloeGG0B0uNAzlh1EgcV96P9wQN1THSIC7w", "contributor": "0x38647F20D41ADE5BE2D68992dD6EFAE0ff0E0B24"}

But after the ups and downs, the heart settles down, and the truth is also clear. A reliable person is the one you should cherish and do things with time.\nWorking with reliable people is a career, and smart people can only sit together and chat in their spare time.\nFind a person who can talk, who has talked a lot of theories, and who has made a big cake for you to see. In the end, only disappointment and unhappiness are left. And find a reliable person to do sales, he will give you 100% satisfaction, or even exceed expectations. Find a customer who can sell this product, and I will sell it well. If there are difficulties or problems, I will try to overcome them. If I don't want to sell it, I won't take the product, let alone do something like \"one order for profit, product life and death have nothing to do with me\". Although this choice is painful for the time being, we can get along with each other for a long time, and we will be very practical every day. I have been in contact with many smart people for so many years. I really benefit from chatting. However, after cooperation, it is found that too smart people think that their own interests outweigh everything. Over time, it is difficult to work together for a long time.\nLooking back now, reliable people are very important. No matter working with them or making friends (including boyfriends and girlfriends of course), they are honest and do things one by one and two by two. The result of doing so is as important as 100% completing the task. Because there will be no accident that will catch you by surprise.\n\n1. Look for reliable people to do things. Smart people can only talk\n   Nowadays, many people talk about the most topic together because we are \"able to talk\". In fact, it has been discovered for a long time that it is \"easy to talk\", which is just a sense of psychological satisfaction, and only reliable can give both sides a sense of security. When a reliable person promises you something, he already knows in his heart what to do about it, and a colleague, subordinate, friend and customer who can only talk to him, most of his promises to you are based on his words and feelings to meet your psychological needs; He never thought about whether the matter itself could be handled. Because of his cleverness, he always makes you think he did his best. In fact, he didn't even think about it. But the reliable person, he will understand each other's difficulties; Then, from their own point of view, do practical things for you as much as possible. Although there may be limitations, there may be differences of opinion, may not be unified within a period of time, or may be rejection. But it is efficient, has obvious intention, and is the basis of sincerity and trust.\n2. Loyalty is far beyond the cleverness of shaking\n   Everyone can have a whim and come up with a skill beyond others. But on the whole, the gap between people is not big. Even if individuals have superior IQ, if they have EQ problems, they will be greatly reduced. Especially in the current era of information development, information dissemination spans regions and groups, and can be reached instantly. It is more able to obtain the required information through search. Therefore, smart people know a lot, but reliable people do not necessarily know less.\n   From the perspective of the whole society, smart people must have good abilities, but they may not be reliable people, that is, their character may not be guaranteed. While reliable people are not necessarily smart people, they must be capable people and honest and trustworthy people within their own capabilities.\n   In real life, people like smart people, which belongs to normal psychology. People can keep in touch. But they may not be willing to get along with each other confidently. The main reason is that the variables are too large. And people with good character and reliable will naturally have reliable people to get along with. That is to say, loyalty is more important than ability in the enterprise.\n3. Ability can be cultivated, but it's not easy to change when your character is bad\n   Some people hold their tails tightly when they cooperate with you. Once they do not cooperate, any bad means will be used. Because of his intelligence, he put on a coat of \"kindness\" and \"reality\", which made people feel that he was very real. But the harm to reliable people is too great. Most of them are not good at words. They will only get along with people with heart and suffer losses. The big deal is to speak face to face. That is what people often say, good \"bullies\" and \"good people\". As a result, I was greatly aggrieved. Tears were swallowed into my stomach and wiped dry. It was still sunny.\n   In the current society, it is a precious resource to meet reliable people. In all fields of society, if they can encounter a lucky thing in the enterprise, they should cherish it.\n   The most profound experience over the years is that a reliable person introduces a friend to you. Cooperation is a good character and reliable person. If an unreliable person introduces you to a friend or colleague, you can also meet a reliable person, but you need to have insight, otherwise you can only take a chance. Our choice of work is reliable. It is to choose an excellent quality. Once you treat things reliably, you may be hurt temporarily. But you can also test your friends or partners, screen out the most unreliable people, and finally gather a group of righteousness around you.

Later, I thought about that tweet again, and I realised it was right! At the time, I was designing prototypes for our web3 app, [After.](https://after.fund/)\n\nMy experience was so interesting and enlightening that I felt it could be helpful for other designers, too. So, here I will showcase my **brand-design journey**, and describe the lessons I have learned.\n\n### Preliminary research\n\nMy eye-opening research on different web3 projects brought up **a wealth of identikit brands** that reflected everything the infamous tweet describes.\n\n![Similar illustrations and font style among web3 projects websites](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Jrl6CSsOymorWTZDwDgi.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThese results also show that when it comes to branding a web3 project, designers can be somewhat clueless. This is partly because such projects tend to focus on rigid technical concepts that feel abstract and unfamiliar.\n\nOther designers simply feel **overwhelmed by the infinite possibilities at their feet.**  Consider that most of these projects live exclusively in the digital world: hence, just about anything is possible! So why is it that we keep on doing the same things?\n\n### Storytelling is the answer\n\nThis is not the first time I have talked about \"storytelling\".  That’s because for me, **storytelling is more than a buzzword.**\n\nStorytelling is my only way of working, and **the only path that leads a brand towards a strong, relatable sense of identity and purpose.** This is compounded when we consider that, most of the time, both (identity and purpose) are sorely lacking from web3 brand identities.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I will illustrate the three steps that helped create our company's story.\n\n## Lesson01. Write your story from who you are, no matter how complex the technology or intangible the project.\n\nMost web3 projects try to paint a sophisticated brand identity, often using abstract and/or futuristic illustrations and imagery (*lesson 03*), blunt typography, and neon colours to explain who they are.\n\nThis is as far as their identities go, so no wonder they all look alike.\n\nFrom experience, I understand all too well that if you can’t explain “who you are” through images, you’ll also struggle to communicate your unique identity through words (aka content, *see lesson 02*).\n\nThe task becomes even more complicated when even you don’t know why your brand exists!\n\nTo overcome this issue, the first stage in branding your next web3 project is to **define your key differentiators** (in the form of a mission, vision, values and purpose). Only then will you **create a story that allows others to understand and share your beliefs.**\n\n**After** uses the blockchain technology of smart contracts to create **an automated, transparent, immutable, and private distribution of assets** at an event-based future trigger (for example the death of a person, or a change in their Will).\n\nAnswering Marty Neumeier's questionnaire (a set of 17 questions to find the *Onliness Statement*, that cardinal distinction that can help the business owners to create a prosperous brand.), we defined that our company's mission is **to help people realise the power of wealth.**\n\nFor this reason, the main inspiration for our story derives from the keys of Pluto. According to the Orphic Hymn to Pluto, among many other attributes, Pluto owns the keys that connect with God's capacity to give humanity wealth.\n\nIn ancient Greek burial practices, the **keys** symbolised revelations that the deceased was obligated to keep secret, along with a coin placed in their mouth to ensure a safe passage into the next world.\n\nWith such rich references to draw upon, the key became an essential visual element of After's branding, while the coin became **After's utility token #OBOL.**\n\n![After brandmark](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1lEDbqUMzrvrBRm4WMmDt.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n**After's brandmark is a key**, which features a bespoke design of the capital letter A on the top. This brandmark is enclosed in a geometric hexagonal shape, representing the value of privacy and secrecy.\n\nThis sophisticated and elegant brandmark is paired with **a bespoke sans serif typeface** representing the bold encrypted structure behind creating a Will through After's platform.\n\nThe design of the capital letter above the key is also used to represent the utility token #OBOL.\n\n![#OBOL symbol and tokenomics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7AYiTtGX0_1h-DNybLFJV.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Lesson 02. Build a community through content, and project personality through fonts.\n\nIn a world that is entirely digital, such as web3, typefaces can break traditional print-rules and enjoy the freedom they deserve on-screen… where they can be the stars!\n\nUnfortunately, when they are overused, large, animated typefaces create a bustling environment that tires our eyes and drains our minds’ focus from the rightful heart of the brand’s storytelling: **content.**\n\nOne beautiful side of the de-centralised web is the **communities** that form from similarities in specific ideas, and your project’s unique values (as explained in *lesson 01*). So, the right content is critical.\n\nIf this interaction is missing, you will deprive your users of **meaningful participation in the web3 experience.** No matter how fancy and futuristic your project is, make sure your typeface is also clear, legible, and humanly expressive, so it can properly introduce your project to its users.\n\nFor **After**, we wanted to build a community whose **values could inspire future generations.** After must communicate a sense of immutability and permanence, because this is our promise to the community.\n\nOur content also reflects how After speaks to **a primal human need** (the desire to ensure a better future for our loved ones), which is powered by blockchain technology (immutability and permanence).\n\n![Organization of the content on After landing page](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pj0WuTw5eHDE-_MRYa1c3.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nOur values and duality are revealed in our specific choice of typeface.\n\nWe opted for **Frank Rhule Libre**, the digital version of a traditional serif typeface used mainly in print.  We then paired this with a modern sans serif font, **Lato**, which is exclusively designed for the digital world (though it looks good in print, too!).\n\nThe sans serif has been used in every header, to deliver essential concepts and help readers to scan the page effortlessly.\n\nLato, meanwhile, has been widely used in long paragraphs for its semi-rounded details that aid readability, as well as offering a sense of gravitas.\n\n![Some slides of our pitch deck to illustrate the usage of the typeface](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kt4Ms5XBxN853vjLjAkIH.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nStorytelling also helped us to elaborate the delicate **concept of death** in a personal and expressive way, focusing on positive legacy rather than heartbreak. For this reason, the word **\"departure\"** was chosen over “death”.\n\nOur users are referred to as **Afterists**: people who have taken control of defining a positive future for their loved ones.\n\n**After** also promises to make the **journey** towards creating a Will both pleasant and accessible – a simple process that is literally at their fingertips.\n\n## Lesson 03. Illustrate your story: create differentiation with your own visual language.\n\nColours and illustrations are powerful storytelling methods.\nHowever, if your web3 project's visual language feels similar to that of so many other projects, **how can you differentiate yourself?**\n\nAs we have already touched upon, the alarming similarity is likely due to your attempt to explain the technology behind the project (which most of the time is complicated and feels unfamiliar), rather than explaining the values and purpose of your brand.\n\nWhen illustrated with intention, **a compelling story has the power to spark conversation.**\n\nIf you explore your company's key differentiators (mission, values and purpose), you will be forced to **think creatively about your brand's unique story**, and how you can harness its competitive power.\n\nIn the case of **After**, our values inspired our colours: from the very light, like white and pink (emotion, afterlife, purity, clarity, meditation, light), to darker, more sophisticated shades like purple and black (wealth, death, meaning, passage, spiritual).\n\n![After brand colors and values associated with each color ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zqXv2o4DfhxfKWGldDAxW.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThis content (including our mission and purpose) inspired our illustrations.\n\nAs we mentioned in *lesson 02*, we used the words *journey* and *departure* to introduce and explain our app. An inspirational story, the Myth of Pluto, describes **the journey in the afterlife.**\n\nHence, I created a series of illustrations that visualise the passage of our Afterists to a world that is peaceful and everlasting, crafted from expansive architecture and infinite skies.\n\nThe illustrations are also part of **a** **non-fungible token (NFT) collection called Elysium** (from the Greek, *Ēlýsion pedion*; a conception of the afterlife developed over time by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults).\n\nThe Elysium artworks, or NFTs, will be distributed as a ‘pass’ to join the community. Only pass holders can unlock community-specific channels, or gain access to exclusive perks and rewards.\n\n![Samples of Elysium NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q1zRxx_Gl6Btv7C73z3hr.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Takeaways\n\nIn a world that changes so rapidly, storytelling can help web3 projects hold users’ attention, as they build lasting and memorable community connections. Working on our After's narrative, we learned:\n\n* Your mission, vision, values, and personality will **build your unique storytelling strategy.**\n* Your story will guide you towards choosing the right words for your content, and a typeface that clearly **expresses your ethos.**\n* Storytelling inspires illustrations that focus on the key differentiators, helping you forge **meaningful connections with your customers.**\n\n**We hope you enjoyed my designer's journey!  If you would like to start a new journey all of your own, that cares for and protects your loved ones, [you can visit After’s website to find out more.](https://after.fund/)**", "timestamp": 1654530625, "digest": "Wg9Dm5EOzloeGG0B0uNAzlh1EgcV96P9wQN1THSIC7w", "contributor": "0x38647F20D41ADE5BE2D68992dD6EFAE0ff0E0B24"}
{"id": "vkwYZleRXi33omYe94YPsrCboLl_lKv7zmqOnZBDXOQ", "title": "Community-run employer database - it is our moral duty!", "body": "Twitter: @realblindapp\n\nIn the last few years, we’ve experienced increasing instability due to several factors that I’m sure the reader does not need to be reminded of. No matter how many times the boom and bust cycle happens, we never seem to learn to put the responsibility on the right people.\n\nWhile there is a lot to say about it generally, I’m here to talk about employers and their responsibility to their existing and future workers. I’ve been increasingly frustrated to see employers cede this responsibility in the most cynical and sinister forms.\n\nSpare me the regular:\n\n1. “This is the way business is, this is what we signed up for when adopting a capitalistic system“ - This might be true, but this is also a classic misdirection tactic. While capitalism discusses profit maximization, it by no means discusses society condoning irresponsible and egregious corporate behavior.\n2. “Cancelling offers is completely legal in most states“ - This is of course true, but this is the problem. We need mechanisms to penalize bad actors that take advantage of the legal system to protect their irresponsible behavior. We should also elevate and profit actors that behave responsibly and do not condone short-term thinking and blame-shifting.\n3. “The market will take care of it, it’s bad business” - Ten years ago I would have said the same, but after repeatedly seeing this is not true. Bad press coverage can be surpassed and people have short memories.\n\n## Why does this matter?\n\nTech-workers are a generally incredibly lucky group of people. Their skills are in extremely high demand and they are compensated generously for their work. Their benefits and conditions are unparalleled to other professions.\n\nThis creates a common set of misconceptions that we see refuted over and over when things turn in the economy:\n\n1. “You have nothing to worry about since your skills are in demand” - While this might be true, it doesn’t negate the incredibly high mental cost of being laid off or having your offer rescinded. Furthermore, in bad markets, it might not necessarily be easy to find a comparable job (not just money-wise, a lot of things go into job satisfaction).\n2. “This is a two-way street, you can also leave your job at any time“ - While this is technically true, it is incredibly misleading. Leaving your job doesn’t result in the corporation losing its livelihood, health insurance for you and your family, your visa (and sometimes results in you being forced out of your home), and dignity.\n3. “Corporations are required by law to maximize profits” - This is of course true, but this is the point. Shareholders don’t have to worry about mass layoffs or generally terrible corporate behavior because the company doesn’t pay a price for it. There needs to be a reputation tax to offset this.\n4. What if the corporations must lay off their workers to save themselves, should they be penalized too? When interviewing for a job, workers routinely are asked to provide background information, pass tests, and convince future colleagues and bosses that they are trustworthy. Why shouldn’t corporations have to go through the same set of hoops? If you had a justified business case for doing what you did, make it to the prospective candidates. If they request further assurances before taking the job, this is the price you have to pay (which I can guarantee you is less than the price the people you laid off had to pay).\n\n## Community-owned reputations database\n\nThe next step is always to create a centralized solution, à la glassdoor, blind, LinkedIn, level.fyi, you name it. This always follows a similar pattern:\n\n1. Mission statement and excitement - centralized service announces they are going to disrupt the market and would never be bought by foreign interests.\n2. Database and community grows - For a while, centralized service acts responsibly and advocates for workers’ rights.\n3. Centralized service is looking to monetize - Generally speaking, providing an honest and impartial platform is pretty bad business. You have all the costs associated with running the service without real monetization options.\n4. Centralized service gets acquired or sells off - Here the owners realize two things: They have valuable data. They can manipulate rankings and surpass information for a price.\n5. Repeat\n\n**The only sustainable approach is to have a worker-owned and managed database that isn’t for sale.**\n\n## What’s next?\n\nI don’t have all the answers to what comes next, but I know that something needs to be done and this is the time to do it. People never rally around these causes in good times because there doesn’t seem to be a need. Imagine the pain of your friends and countrymen that had to endure one or multiple layoffs in recent years. Imagine the pain of people that came to your country to better themselves and their children’s future to be disposed of once they weren’t needed anymore.\n\nI know one project can’t fix everything, but this is a step in the right direction. Bitcoin has changed the way we think about money, and Ethereum has changed the way we envision the web, this is the time to start using it for good.\n\nI’m writing this piece with the backdrop of the horrific shooting in Texas that took the life of 21 innocent children. I’m seeing the lack of care for human life that is shown for the sake of “freedom”.  People should have the freedom the conduct business, but they should do so with dignity and care for the other, we must keep building to ensure it happens.", "timestamp": 1654530562, "digest": "QODuEakkJ2LjojFgPCDWAy93kxjYVfENdJ-Wo6ve4Xk", "contributor": "0xCA67AA71eE852e539326625ad9D0e273Ab22d155"}
{"id": "7E1c6HDebC-cYMn09Ne7z7l4z0iI_ftlNP2ySgmHm1w", "title": "The more you show off, the farther away from what you want", "body": "Someone said: if you want to know what a person lacks in his heart, you only need to see what he is showing off. If you want to know what a person's inferiority complex is, you just need to see what he is hiding.\nGenerally speaking, people who show off always have a domineering posture and condescending manner, and always think that they are important, but in fact, people don't have much to show off. Everyone is born the same, leaving the luxurious cars and gorgeous clothes, leaving the crowd surrounded by the police cars, coming to the bathhouse, stripped of their clothes, they are the same people, no high or low.\nShowing off is also a way to express beauty, and a way to show your inner beauty. Peacocks show off their beauty by opening their screens, cocks show off their voices by crowing, and hens tell their peers that I am better than you by laying eggs. Animal flaunting is an instinct. Similarly, human flaunting is an instinct in essence, but people have thoughts and consciousness, so it is important to master principles. After all, there is nothing wrong with showing off. What is wrong is not paying attention to the occasion and not being measured properly.\nFlaunting is usually understood as vanity and impetuosity. However, if the \"vanity and impetuosity\" are stripped off, the flaunting person just wants to get self satisfaction and sense of achievement through the envious eyes of others. Sometimes, this extreme desire for self satisfaction and sense of achievement stems from the inferiority complex and lack of security in the heart.\nIn real life, many people have been troubled by vanity, but there are strong and weak performances in everyone. When it is weak, it can not make people aware of its harm. Once it develops from weak to strong, driven by strong vanity, it will produce all kinds of terrible motives. The consequences of this motivation are terrible.\nPeople who like to show off often pay attention to other people's evaluation of themselves in life and work, and like to listen to flattery. They don't work hard, but are keen to make superficial articles, envy people who are stronger than themselves, and tolerate others' achievements. They like to belittle others and gloat over misfortunes.\nIn addition, showing off is also a sign of immaturity and self-confidence. A person needs to be affirmed by others, but if you show off too much, others don't want to say more, because you have said enough.\nEven if you are better than others in all aspects, there is no reason to show off. Showing off can only show that you are superficial. If you don't get recognition from others, you will only block your own development path.\nThose who show off can not gain fame, charm, respect, or luck by showing off. They can only incur disgust, contempt, jealousy, and even disaster.\nThe romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of China's four famous books, records such a story. Yangxiu, a famous writer, is recognized by the world for his extreme intelligence and quick thinking. Once, he accompanied the Prime Minister Cao Cao to visit a newly built garden. After visiting, Cao Cao wrote a big word \"live\" on the gate and left without any explanation. The officials in charge of building the garden were baffled, but Yang Xiu, who was on the other side, understood Cao Cao's move and immediately told them: \"adding the word\" Huo \"to the\" gate \"is not the word\" Kuo \". The prime minister thought the gate was too big, so he made it smaller.\" On another occasion, someone gave Cao Cao a box of crisp. Cao Cao wrote \"Yihe crisp\" on the box with a letter pen. When Yang Xiu saw it, he immediately gave the box of crispy cakes to the people and ate it. He also said plausibly: \"the prime minister wrote 'Yihe crispy', which means one bite of crispy cake for each person.\"\nYang Xiu used his intelligence to play tricks many times, which caused Cao Cao's disgust and jealousy. Until later, Cao Cao led his troops to fight Zhugeliang in Hanzhong. The war was very difficult, and the army was caught up in the heavy rain. For a moment, the army was in a dilemma. One evening, when his subordinates asked him what his night command was, Cao Cao casually said \"chicken ribs\". When Yang Xiu heard the command, he immediately advised the generals to pack up and prepare to retreat. The generals asked him why, and he said, \"chicken ribs are tasteless to eat but a pity to discard. The prime minister used them as a password tonight to show that he intends to give up here.\" When Cao Cao learned of this, he became furious and executed Yang Xiu for disturbing the morale of the army.\nIn life, some people think that showing off is to attract others and is a way to show their own value. This is actually an extremely shallow understanding. The value of diamonds and gold is not due to the surface flash - diamonds are valued for their unparalleled hardness, while gold is valued for its unparalleled quality.\nFalse boasting can only last for a while, but not for a long time. We can show off the achievements we have made through our own efforts, the development of science and technology, and the achievements we have made in doing good for the people\nAt the same time, we should have a good attitude in the face of others' showing off. Wang Fanzhi once wrote a doggerel poem in the Tang Dynasty: \"when others ride on a horse, I ride on a donkey alone. Looking back at the man who carries firewood, I am more worried.\" By \"more\" here, I mean I feel better.\nSome people are jealous when they see others showing off their wealth, and they are mixed with the mentality of \"hating the rich\". \"Hating the rich\" and \"hating\" are not \"rich\". On the contrary, they are worried that they are not rich, and this mentality often makes people extreme.\nSome people may think that the peacock's opening the screen is also a kind of show off, but the show off of the animal world is different from that of human beings. The male peacock often unfolds because its feathers are very beautiful, but the most important thing is that it is necessary for him to reproduce. But if people want to show off like peacocks, it's a little unreasonable. If people often show off and the people around them don't like it, it will be a big laugh.", "timestamp": 1654530800, "digest": "hlCCwgW4n4OZ7autD4UV6DMaror9qdvMPCRPUS0Ej9w", "contributor": "0xC23F3ecEf98C3aBdEd0810c118e8FdE1fe1f604A"}

Build a community through content, and project personality through fonts.\n\nIn a world that is entirely digital, such as web3, typefaces can break traditional print-rules and enjoy the freedom they deserve on-screen… where they can be the stars!\n\nUnfortunately, when they are overused, large, animated typefaces create a bustling environment that tires our eyes and drains our minds’ focus from the rightful heart of the brand’s storytelling: **content.**\n\nOne beautiful side of the de-centralised web is the **communities** that form from similarities in specific ideas, and your project’s unique values (as explained in *lesson 01*).

Illustrate your story: create differentiation with your own visual language.\n\nColours and illustrations are powerful storytelling methods.\nHowever, if your web3 project's visual language feels similar to that of so many other projects, **how can you differentiate yourself?**\n\nAs we have already touched upon, the alarming similarity is likely due to your attempt to explain the technology behind the project (which most of the time is complicated and feels unfamiliar), rather than explaining the values and purpose of your brand.\n\nWhen illustrated with intention, **a compelling story has the power to spark conversation.**\n\nIf you explore your company's key differentiators (mission, values and purpose), you will be forced to **think creatively about your brand's unique story**, and how you can harness its competitive power.\n\nIn the case of **After**, our values inspired our colours: from the very light, like white and pink (emotion, afterlife, purity, clarity, meditation, light), to darker, more sophisticated shades like purple and black (wealth, death, meaning, passage, spiritual).\n\n![After brand colors and values associated with each color ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zqXv2o4DfhxfKWGldDAxW.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThis content (including our mission and purpose) inspired our illustrations.\n\nAs we mentioned in *lesson 02*, we used the words *journey* and *departure* to introduce and explain our app. An inspirational story, the Myth of Pluto, describes **the journey in the afterlife.**\n\nHence, I created a series of illustrations that visualise the passage of our Afterists to a world that is peaceful and everlasting, crafted from expansive architecture and infinite skies.\n\nThe illustrations are also part of **a** **non-fungible token (NFT) collection called Elysium** (from the Greek, *Ēlýsion pedion*; a conception of the afterlife developed over time by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults).\n\nThe Elysium artworks, or NFTs, will be distributed as a ‘pass’ to join the community.

Later, I thought about that tweet again, and I realised it was right! At the time, I was designing prototypes for our web3 app, [After.](https://after.fund/)\n\nMy experience was so interesting and enlightening that I felt it could be helpful for other designers, too. So, here I will showcase my **brand-design journey**, and describe the lessons I have learned.\n\n### Preliminary research\n\nMy eye-opening research on different web3 projects brought up **a wealth of identikit brands** that reflected everything the infamous tweet describes.\n\n![Similar illustrations and font style among web3 projects websites](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Jrl6CSsOymorWTZDwDgi.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThese results also show that when it comes to branding a web3 project, designers can be somewhat clueless. This is partly because such projects tend to focus on rigid technical concepts that feel abstract and unfamiliar.\n\nOther designers simply feel **overwhelmed by the infinite possibilities at their feet.**  Consider that most of these projects live exclusively in the digital world: hence, just about anything is possible! So why is it that we keep on doing the same things?\n\n### Storytelling is the answer\n\nThis is not the first time I have talked about \"storytelling\".  That’s because for me, **storytelling is more than a buzzword.**\n\nStorytelling is my only way of working, and **the only path that leads a brand towards a strong, relatable sense of identity and purpose.** This is compounded when we consider that, most of the time, both (identity and purpose) are sorely lacking from web3 brand identities.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I will illustrate the three steps that helped create our company's story.\n\n## Lesson01. Write your story from who you are, no matter how complex the technology or intangible the project.\n\nMost web3 projects try to paint a sophisticated brand identity, often using abstract and/or futuristic illustrations and imagery (*lesson 03*), blunt typography, and neon colours to explain who they are.\n\nThis is as far as their identities go, so no wonder they all look alike.\n\nFrom experience, I understand all too well that if you can’t explain “who you are” through images, you’ll also struggle to communicate your unique identity through words (aka content, *see lesson 02*).\n\nThe task becomes even more complicated when even you don’t know why your brand exists!\n\nTo overcome this issue, the first stage in branding your next web3 project is to **define your key differentiators** (in the form of a mission, vision, values and purpose). Only then will you **create a story that allows others to understand and share your beliefs.**\n\n**After** uses the blockchain technology of smart contracts to create **an automated, transparent, immutable, and private distribution of assets** at an event-based future trigger (for example the death of a person, or a change in their Will).\n\nAnswering Marty Neumeier's questionnaire (a set of 17 questions to find the *Onliness Statement*, that cardinal distinction that can help the business owners to create a prosperous brand.), we defined that our company's mission is **to help people realise the power of wealth.**\n\nFor this reason, the main inspiration for our story derives from the keys of Pluto.

{"id": "t6T9lPBD-FGtpZ8vTRrkU1k4xsenbetnlJRcxJvCoxs", "title": "Low EQ, how deadly is it?", "body": "one\nA friend told me something. Her classmate went to the man's house for the first time and brought a lot of supplements. She hoped to make a good first impression.\nAfter arriving, she handed the tonic to her boyfriend's mother: \"Auntie, you must take more tonic, or you will definitely get sick.\"\nOriginally, her boyfriend's mother smiled kindly. After hearing this, her smile suddenly became unnatural.\nCoincidentally, one month later, the other party was really ill. She bought a bunch of supplements to visit the hospital. The first sentence was: \"Auntie, I told you last time to eat more supplements, or you would get sick. Look, are you really ill now?\"\nHer boyfriend quickly pulled her out of the hospital. A month later, her boyfriend told her that her mother didn't like her very much. Let's break up!\nShe couldn't accept it. She came to her friend and asked, \"what the hell is wrong with you? I bought tonics and went to the hospital to see her. Why doesn't she like me?\"\nLow EQ, how deadly is it?\nThe friend knew that the classmate couldn't speak, so he asked her to change. She raised her neck and said, \"what I said is the truth. You see, it came true. As expected, she was ill. She should thank me...\"\ntwo\nThree years ago, Mr. Wang participated in campus recruitment. One candidate's resume was particularly outstanding, which was very in line with the recruitment needs of his company.\nOn the day of the interview, several interviewers sat in a row and asked him to briefly introduce himself.\nThe other party glanced at the resume in their hands and said, \"haven't I already written it? Won't you read it yourself?\"\nOne sentence made them stunned for several seconds. Mr. Zhang recovered and continued to ask him, \"then tell me about your plans for future career development!\"\nThe other party looked at them with disdain and said, \"planning is something that you middle-aged and old people like to do. Our young people have unlimited creativity. Maybe one day they will suddenly be like Ma Yun. How can we plan well?\"\nSo, several interviewers looked at each other and did one thing at a time: cross the name of this person off the list\nthree\nWhen attending a classmate party, they are required to take their other half with them. Just two minutes after meeting each other, they are still looking at each other's husbands. Most people are secretly commenting on each other. A female classmate said to another female classmate: \"your husband's eyes are not right. It's easy to cheat at first sight. You should be careful!\"\nThe female classmate suddenly looked black. Her husband was very depressed and almost quarreled. Later, we learned that the husband of the classmate stayed up late for a week in a row and suffered from eye disease. Since then, the two students have never spoken again.\nfour\nAt work, a colleague came back from maternity leave to show us her daughter, who was just one month old. We applauded the little girl as cute, and the colleague smiled with satisfaction. When the mobile phone was handed to a female colleague, she looked at it for a long time and said, \"is it cute? Why haven't I found it at all? Look at this eye. It's so small. I think Lin Miaoke was pretty when he was a child. It's cute when he grew up like that.\"\nThe colleague angrily took back his mobile phone and said, \"my daughter is just an ordinary child. In the future, you will have a child like Lin Miaoke yourself!\"\nThe female colleague seemed completely unaware of the other party's anger and said bluntly, \"it doesn't need to be so troublesome. Now the cosmetic technology is so developed, just go to Korea.\"\nThe colleague finally couldn't stand it and slammed the door out. The female colleague looked at us innocently and said, \"what's wrong with her? Did I say the wrong thing?\"\nWe all bowed our heads and pretended to work hard\nfive\nWhen we were in college, the professors who taught us Deng Lun studied at Tsinghua University for their undergraduate, master's and doctor's degrees. In her eyes, Tsinghua University is supreme, and other universities can only catch up with it. As for students in other universities, they are not at the same level as Tsinghua students at all.\nWhen we are taught at ordinary times, the word Tsinghua must be included in the three sentences. For example, \"if you had studied hard, you would have been admitted to Tsinghua. Because you didn't work hard, you had to go to a broken school.\" (PS: our alma mater is really not as good as Tsinghua, but at least it has also ranked among the top ten universities in China.)\nBecause of her resistance to the professor, many students in the class were unwilling to listen to her lectures, or read magazines, or play with their mobile phones. She looked like she hated the iron and did not want to be rigid: \"look at you, what do you look like? It is absolutely impossible to see you in Tsinghua. When I was in Tsinghua... (the remaining ten minutes are omitted)\"\nLater, when a classmate was sleeping in class, the professor called him up to ask questions. He couldn't answer them. She said sadly, \"your style of study is really bad. In Tsinghua...\"\nThe students probably got out of bed and replied impatiently: \"You Tsinghua, You Tsinghua, Tsinghua is so good, why don't you go to Tsinghua as a professor and come to us to teach us what these garbage students are doing?\"\nShe was stunned for ten seconds, patted the table and said, \"in Tsinghua, it is absolutely impossible for students to contradict professors. You are hopeless.\"\nMany students picked up their textbooks and walked out of the classroom directly\nsix\nMy cousin once made a girlfriend. The girl is sweet and beautiful. She is very cute. My cousin plans to make the relationship over a period of time.\nBut a month later, my cousin broke up with us. My aunt disagreed, and my cousin had no choice but to tell the truth.\nOn the girl's birthday, her cousin ordered a bunch of 11 flowers, representing wholeheartedness. After receiving them, the girl said unhappily, \"my ex boyfriend sent me 99 flowers.\"\nOnce when they were walking, they saw a group of people playing basketball. The girl asked him, \"can you play basketball?\"\nMy cousin confessed that he could hardly. The girl proudly told him that her ex boyfriend played basketball very well. By the way, she said a lot of the advantages of her ex boyfriend, completely ignoring her cousin's constipation.\nAnother time, when they went to a movie, the girl asked her cousin a question, but the cousin couldn't answer it. The girl frowned and said, \"you're too stupid. My ex boyfriend answered it all at once.\nMy cousin said, \"do I have to cheat like your ex boyfriend, so you think I'm as good as him?\"\nThe girl pouted and said, \"he would never talk to me in this tone.\"\nSo, there is no suspense about breaking up.\nHow bad is low EQ?\nFirst of all, the most direct manifestation of low EQ is poor popularity. People with low EQ don't understand empathy, empathy, and they don't know how to leave steps for others. They don't even know the minimum respect in getting along. I think unless they want to self abuse, no one wants to make a friend who will poke his heart all the time?\nSecondly, low EQ will inevitably lead to difficult success. A person who lacks the help of friends, even if his ability is outstanding, is also difficult to achieve a career. People with low IQ and high EQ may also achieve a career, but people with low EQ will reduce their chances of success to very little.\nThirdly, people with low EQ are hard to be happy. Just like the example above, falling in love has become a problem. They feel that people around them don't understand themselves. Oneortwo people don't understand. It can be said that it's the other party's problem. But if everyone doesn't understand, I'm afraid they have to look at themselves. There are countless posts on Tianya that roast about wonderful works. In fact, if you classify them a little, you will find that 80% of the wonderful works only reflect the fact that EQ is low to the ground.\nLow EQ is a terrible thing, but the most important thing is that people with low EQ often don't think they have low Eq. they think that others don't understand themselves and don't tolerate themselves. Those who can talk are hypocritical and pretentious. They are frank and honest, not hypocritical, and don't mix with the secular world. That's what matters.", "timestamp": 1654530701, "digest": "2QwFLcOKoKdQjhc0L-GbVZwerut4mzhjsEB4SZXRCHU", "contributor": "0x3aaBC87a87407b83041716bE9f3d4F7Eb5C0E991"}

That’s because for me, **storytelling is more than a buzzword.**\n\nStorytelling is my only way of working, and **the only path that leads a brand towards a strong, relatable sense of identity and purpose.** This is compounded when we consider that, most of the time, both (identity and purpose) are sorely lacking from web3 brand identities.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I will illustrate the three steps that helped create our company's story.\n\n## Lesson01. Write your story from who you are, no matter how complex the technology or intangible the project.\n\nMost web3 projects try to paint a sophisticated brand identity, often using abstract and/or futuristic illustrations and imagery (*lesson 03*), blunt typography, and neon colours to explain who they are.\n\nThis is as far as their identities go, so no wonder they all look alike.\n\nFrom experience, I understand all too well that if you can’t explain “who you are” through images, you’ll also struggle to communicate your unique identity through words (aka content, *see lesson 02*).\n\nThe task becomes even more complicated when even you don’t know why your brand exists!\n\nTo overcome this issue, the first stage in branding your next web3 project is to **define your key differentiators** (in the form of a mission, vision, values and purpose). Only then will you **create a story that allows others to understand and share your beliefs.**\n\n**After** uses the blockchain technology of smart contracts to create **an automated, transparent, immutable, and private distribution of assets** at an event-based future trigger (for example the death of a person, or a change in their Will).\n\nAnswering Marty Neumeier's questionnaire (a set of 17 questions to find the *Onliness Statement*, that cardinal distinction that can help the business owners to create a prosperous brand.), we defined that our company's mission is **to help people realise the power of wealth.**\n\nFor this reason, the main inspiration for our story derives from the keys of Pluto. According to the Orphic Hymn to Pluto, among many other attributes, Pluto owns the keys that connect with God's capacity to give humanity wealth.\n\nIn ancient Greek burial practices, the **keys** symbolised revelations that the deceased was obligated to keep secret, along with a coin placed in their mouth to ensure a safe passage into the next world.\n\nWith such rich references to draw upon, the key became an essential visual element of After's branding, while the coin became **After's utility token #OBOL.**\n\n![After brandmark](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1lEDbqUMzrvrBRm4WMmDt.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n**After's brandmark is a key**, which features a bespoke design of the capital letter A on the top. This brandmark is enclosed in a geometric hexagonal shape, representing the value of privacy and secrecy.\n\nThis sophisticated and elegant brandmark is paired with **a bespoke sans serif typeface** representing the bold encrypted structure behind creating a Will through After's platform.\n\nThe design of the capital letter above the key is also used to represent the utility token #OBOL.\n\n![#OBOL symbol and tokenomics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7AYiTtGX0_1h-DNybLFJV.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Lesson 02. Build a community through content, and project personality through fonts.\n\nIn a world that is entirely digital, such as web3, typefaces can break traditional print-rules and enjoy the freedom they deserve on-screen… where they can be the stars!\n\nUnfortunately, when they are overused, large, animated typefaces create a bustling environment that tires our eyes and drains our minds’ focus from the rightful heart of the brand’s storytelling: **content.**\n\nOne beautiful side of the de-centralised web is the **communities** that form from similarities in specific ideas, and your project’s unique values (as explained in *lesson 01*). So, the right content is critical.\n\nIf this interaction is missing, you will deprive your users of **meaningful participation in the web3 experience.** No matter how fancy and futuristic your project is, make sure your typeface is also clear, legible, and humanly expressive, so it can properly introduce your project to its users.\n\nFor **After**, we wanted to build a community whose **values could inspire future generations.** After must communicate a sense of immutability and permanence, because this is our promise to the community.\n\nOur content also reflects how After speaks to **a primal human need** (the desire to ensure a better future for our loved ones), which is powered by blockchain technology (immutability and permanence).\n\n![Organization of the content on After landing page](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pj0WuTw5eHDE-_MRYa1c3.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nOur values and duality are revealed in our specific choice of typeface.\n\nWe opted for **Frank Rhule Libre**, the digital version of a traditional serif typeface used mainly in print.  We then paired this with a modern sans serif font, **Lato**, which is exclusively designed for the digital world (though it looks good in print, too!).\n\nThe sans serif has been used in every header, to deliver essential concepts and help readers to scan the page effortlessly.\n\nLato, meanwhile, has been widely used in long paragraphs for its semi-rounded details that aid readability, as well as offering a sense of gravitas.\n\n![Some slides of our pitch deck to illustrate the usage of the typeface](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kt4Ms5XBxN853vjLjAkIH.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nStorytelling also helped us to elaborate the delicate **concept of death** in a personal and expressive way, focusing on positive legacy rather than heartbreak. For this reason, the word **\"departure\"** was chosen over “death”.\n\nOur users are referred to as **Afterists**: people who have taken control of defining a positive future for their loved ones.\n\n**After** also promises to make the **journey** towards creating a Will both pleasant and accessible – a simple process that is literally at their fingertips.\n\n## Lesson 03. Illustrate your story: create differentiation with your own visual language.\n\nColours and illustrations are powerful storytelling methods.\nHowever, if your web3 project's visual language feels similar to that of so many other projects, **how can you differentiate yourself?**\n\nAs we have already touched upon, the alarming similarity is likely due to your attempt to explain the technology behind the project (which most of the time is complicated and feels unfamiliar), rather than explaining the values and purpose of your brand.\n\nWhen illustrated with intention, **a compelling story has the power to spark conversation.**\n\nIf you explore your company's key differentiators (mission, values and purpose), you will be forced to **think creatively about your brand's unique story**, and how you can harness its competitive power.\n\nIn the case of **After**, our values inspired our colours: from the very light, like white and pink (emotion, afterlife, purity, clarity, meditation, light), to darker, more sophisticated shades like purple and black (wealth, death, meaning, passage, spiritual).\n\n![After brand colors and values associated with each color ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zqXv2o4DfhxfKWGldDAxW.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nThis content (including our mission and purpose) inspired our illustrations.\n\nAs we mentioned in *lesson 02*, we used the words *journey* and *departure* to introduce and explain our app. An inspirational story, the Myth of Pluto, describes **the journey in the afterlife.**\n\nHence, I created a series of illustrations that visualise the passage of our Afterists to a world that is peaceful and everlasting, crafted from expansive architecture and infinite skies.\n\nThe illustrations are also part of **a** **non-fungible token (NFT) collection called Elysium** (from the Greek, *Ēlýsion pedion*; a conception of the afterlife developed over time by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults).\n\nThe Elysium artworks, or NFTs, will be distributed as a ‘pass’ to join the community. Only pass holders can unlock community-specific channels, or gain access to exclusive perks and rewards.\n\n![Samples of Elysium NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q1zRxx_Gl6Btv7C73z3hr.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Takeaways\n\nIn a world that changes so rapidly, storytelling can help web3 projects hold users’ attention, as they build lasting and memorable community connections. Working on our After's narrative, we learned:\n\n* Your mission, vision, values, and personality will **build your unique storytelling strategy.**\n* Your story will guide you towards choosing the right words for your content, and a typeface that clearly **expresses your ethos.**\n* Storytelling inspires illustrations that focus on the key differentiators, helping you forge **meaningful connections with your customers.**\n\n**We hope you enjoyed my designer's journey!  If you would like to start a new journey all of your own, that cares for and protects your loved ones, [you can visit After’s website to find out more.](https://after.fund/)**", "timestamp": 1654530891, "digest": "Wg9Dm5EOzloeGG0B0uNAzlh1EgcV96P9wQN1THSIC7w", "contributor": "0x38647F20D41ADE5BE2D68992dD6EFAE0ff0E0B24"}

They all get up very early and make full use of the morning time. Say why:\nGetting up early gives you plenty of time to think before a busy day begins. Simply put, the morning time belongs to you. Before others take up your time and attention, prioritize the things you need to deal with that day and make progress. This will give you unprecedented control over each day.\nOf course, it is extremely difficult to get up early, which is precisely why early birds have a competitive advantage over others. When others press the snooze button, they are ready for the new day.\nGive a few examples of the super successful early bird.\nRichard Branson, founder of virgin airlines, woke up at 5:45 a.m., even on his own private island. Before starting the day's work, he made full use of his morning time to exercise and eat breakfast.\nMichelle Obama, the first lady of the United States, gets up at 4:30 a.m. every day to start exercising, while her children are still asleep.\nTim Cook, CEO of apple, gets up at 3:45 a.m. every day, handles email, goes to the gym for exercise, and trots to Starbucks before going to the office.\nHoward Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, gets up at 4:30 to exercise. He usually rides with his wife. Of course, in order to face the new day, coffee is indispensable.\nDisney CEO Bob Iger also gets up at 4:30 a.m., reads newspapers, does sports, listens to music, answers emails, and even watches TV.\nAnna Wintour, the editor in chief of vogue, gets up at 5:45 in the morning to play tennis for an hour, and then starts the day's work.\nJeff Immelt, CEO of Ge, gets up at 5:30 and reads newspapers while doing heart exercises.\nCan you find commonalities among these super successful people? Everyone's morning activities include the very important element of morning exercise.\nIn addition to helping the overall health and shaping, some studies have shown that 20 minutes of moderate exercise can produce positive psychological and emotional factors, and can last for 12 hours!\nThis means that these business leaders will be clearer and more efficient, and these are the direct benefits of morning exercise. The time for exercise also allows them to focus on Problems and think about countermeasures without being disturbed.\nTherefore, when they enter the office, they can quickly enter the state. Morning exercise is good for efficient use of time.\nIn addition to getting up early and exercising, several other good morning habits are recommended to help you spend your day more efficiently:\n\n1. Drink 16 ounces of water when you wake up - to help you hydrate after 7 or 8 hours of sleep;\n2. Make your bed: making your bed every morning is closely related to your efficiency throughout the day;\n3. Eat a healthy breakfast: replenish energy for your body to better meet the challenges of the day (such as eating some high-energy fruits and vegetables);\n4. Drink 1-2 cups of coffee: coffee has been proved to be helpful to health. Use it to wake up your morning;\n5. Read the news: use quiet time to understand what is happening in the world around you;\n6. Set priorities for each day: determine what is most important and think about how to take action.\n   All of the above can help you move in the direction of success - before your busy day begins - in whatever form. Being a morning person is not only applicable to those senior management, but everyone will benefit from these good habits.\n   Are you thinking that this is impossible because you just need more sleep?

{"id": "gUrTCdGqwhcPb1BOPB6fZkGfgKiCh0WYohnJ9A14a8Y", "title": "Why do the busier people have more time to exercise?", "body": "\"I really want to exercise, but I just don't have time. I'm too busy!\" When it comes to running, exercise and fitness, many people blurt out this sentence.\nwait a moment! It is said that U.S. President Barack Obama insists on exercising at least 6 days a week, each time for about 45 minutes. He will only rest on Sundays. The first thing he does after getting up every morning is to rush into his gym to start exercising. Therefore, such a president dare to show off his strong body naked in public.\nObama's story is a little far from us. After all, people spend most of their time in the United States on the other side of the ocean. But look at Panshiyi and his wife Zhang Xin, who often share the fun of running in their microblogs; Mao Daqing, general manager of Vanke Beijing Branch, also likes running. Now he has started running marathons; Zhangmei, the founder of Bishan travel agency, is also a runner. She also has a small circle of mothers who love running. She often shares her running and fitness experiences.\nWhen it comes to busyness, you certainly can't compare with Obama. He is a president of a big country. He is extremely nervous when dealing with the global affairs of the United States; If you are busy, you can hardly compare with the entrepreneurs and senior managers mentioned above. People can't wait to have three heads and six arms to run a business.\nI guess these people are busier than you. But why, the busier a person is, the more time he has to keep fit? The reasons are as follows:\nFirst of all, they realized the importance of physical health and put fitness at the top of their priorities. Therefore, no matter how busy these people are, they should set aside enough time for exercise. You might as well think about whether the running shoes and fitness cards you bought impulsively on the first day of junior high school have been shelved for various reasons.\nSecond, these busy people manage their time more efficiently. They can distinguish between what is important and urgent and what is important but not urgent. Many people spend most of their time on Weibo, shopping websites or wechat groups. These people are often dizzy and very hard at the end of the day. There is no time and interest to go to fitness!\nThe last and most important reason is that they have found the fun of fitness. A person who unremittingly invests in sports that often make him sweat profusely must have found fun in it, not just to lose weight, not just to reduce fatty liver or the three high indexes during physical examination. Only when a person experiences this kind of fun can he really immerse himself in it and stick to it all the time.\nTherefore, if you only go to the gym to lose weight, it is estimated that you can hardly lose weight and keep fit.\nPS：\nThe 43rd US President George W. Bush (2001-2009) loved sports, especially running. Run six times a week, and usually do speed runs on Sundays. When he was 56 years old in 2002, he ran at a speed of 4 minutes 16 seconds or 4 minutes 19 seconds per kilometer on Sundays, usually lasting 3 miles (4.8 kilometers). In 1993, he participated in a marathon at the age of 46, with a result of 3 hours and 44 minutes.\nAs president, he did not stop exercising. He was sweating in the White House gym and the mall of Camp David. On business trips, the US president's special plane air force 1 and hotel suites will be equipped with a treadmill for him to run. He ran on air force one for an hour and a half.\nSo when someone asked him how to make time for exercise, he said: \"I believe anyone can make the time. as a matter of fact, I don't believe it-I know it. if the president of the United States can make the time, anyone can.\" After reading what he said, do you still think you have time to exercise?", "timestamp": 1654531125, "digest": "dOOpbA9Lf6EFgzZUN1R9CA-o_8O-upIWvt2cjuktees", "contributor": "0x4CC4508fb3aba2276fA9734cC25b29499137D452"}

It’s for anyone who seeks to understand the evolution of the internet, and where we are on the journey towards a decentralized, community-owned-and-operated alternative to the centralized tech platforms of web2 – especially as it touches creators and other builders.\n\nThe top themes are distilled into five summary takeaways below, but be sure to dig into these 50+ slides (full deck for the 2022 State of Crypto Report available for download below); be sure to also sign up for the a16z crypto newsletter to continue getting insights as well as updates about upcoming resources and to listen to the new web3 with a16z podcast to dive deeper into the findings and methodology.\n\n5 key takeaways\n\n\\#1 We’re in the middle of the fourth ‘price-innovation’ cycle\n\nMarkets are seasonal; crypto is no exception. Summers give way to the chill of winter, and winter thaws in the heat of summer. Advances made by builders during dark days eventually re-trigger optimism when the dust settles. With the recent market downturn, we may be entering such a period now.\n\nAlthough crypto can be volatile and its cycles seem chaotic, there is an underlying logic at work, as Chris and Eddy first pointed out in 2020. (See slides 9 through 12 in the deck.) Whereas prices are often a lagging indicator of performance in some industries, in crypto they are a leading indicator. Prices are a hook. The numbers drive interest, which drives ideas and activity, which in turn drives innovation. We call this feedback loop “the price-innovation cycle”, and it has been the engine that has propelled the industry through multiple distinct waves since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009.\n\nAs legendary investor Benjamin Graham once allegorized: It’s best to pay no mind to “Mr. Market”, who frequently boomerangs from exuberance and euphoria to despair and depression. To Graham’s wisdom we add an addendum: Better to build. Consider that any prospective founders who swore off tech and the internet in the aftermath of the early-2000s dotcom crash missed the best opportunities of the decade: cloud computing, social networks, online video streaming, smartphones, etc. Now is the time to consider what the equivalent successes will be in web3.\n\n☆Source : https://a16zcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-report-a16z-2022/", "timestamp": 1654531127, "digest": "CD8LQ9n4sRjOv14nw-C6i_XZbrXqWRpanFtzxSWQ2N0", "contributor": "0xC2cA4eE4C8C79796e8beea362F657F5004a9d1Ca"}

{"id": "rtIcDaEHkLQ_dcxNeMnHqFNxLyuEOMOiwwG4wLLUiWo", "title": "Class is a long ladder. What level can you climb?", "body": "1、 Class\nBefore the name change, there were several expressways in Shanghai. They are A5 of Shenyang Haikou expressway, a8 of Shanghai Nanjing Expressway, A9 of Shanghai Hangzhou Expressway and a10.\nA good Samaritan gave a signal at random. A7 is used to express a person's wealth. A is asset and 7 is 7 digits.\nFor example, A5 represents total assets of ￥ 10000. Destitute, close to the edge of beggars.\nA5.3 total assets: 30000 yuan\nA6, 100000 yuan\nA6.5, 500000 yuan\nA7, onemillion\nA7.8, eightmillion\nA8, 10 million\nA9, 100 million\nA10, billion\nA11, billionaire\nIn Shanghai, the net assets of most ordinary households are concentrated between A7 and A7.5. If they can reach the level of A80 million, they will be regarded as rich.\nHere, we want to say a concept of \"stratum\".\nWhat is stratum, the dividing line of stratum.\nIn the eyes of class A, \"it's a big thing\", but in the eyes of class B, \"it's nothing.\".\nIn this way, it is difficult for a and B to communicate. Their way of life, values and outlook on life will also have great conflicts. For example, the old lady tries hard to clean up the old bottles, and you can't wait to throw them all away.\nHow much is the difference between one class and another.\nDifferent from what ordinary people think. A7 and A8 are not divided into two classes. We generally think that three times is a class.\nAbout 3 times the gap. Enough to make two people have a fundamental difference in judgment of a thing.\nFor example, a spent 45W to buy a BMW, which is a big deal for him. And cherish and show off for this.\nBut for B, he is three times richer than a. The concept of 45W is similar to that of 15W Passat in his mind.\nWill b show off for the 45W car. He won't. It's just an ordinary consumer product.\nTriple the difference to form a class. For example, if you work hard to save the down payment, people can pay in full with this energy.\nTherefore, a7 and A8 are not level 1, but level 2.\nA7 and A9 differ by fourth order.\n2、 How kind are the princes and generals\nWe live in an age of losers. Losers make up the majority of the population.\nIn the past few years, I have heard some interesting slogans, which were shouted by a loser: \"is it fair to fight for your father? Is there any seed for the prince to be peaceful?\"\nHe meant that since his father was a worthless drunkard driver and farmer, everyone should leave his father alone. Such rules of the game are the \"fairest\".\nOn the other hand, he believed that after two years of college, he would make a second-hand decision, and this life could reach the level of one billion \"princes and generals\".\nNeither is true.\nIn reality, wealth is a long ladder. It often takes generations to accumulate. Some families in Europe usually need threehundred or fivehundred years to accumulate the details of a family.\nFor a loser, if he was born in A5, he would hardly have any hope of climbing to a10. It would be nice if he could climb to A8 in his life. Specifically, it means moving away from the county seat and settling in Shanghai.\nFor his son, standing on the basis of A8, working hard and having a good tutor, he may be able to A9.\nFor his grandson, standing on the basis of A9, diligent and sincere, maybe he can a10.\nWealth depends on the accumulation of several generations. Slowly, people step by step to a higher level. This may seem slow, but it is the right way.\nIn a shocking sentence, \"what was your father doing when he was fighting?\"\nIf this paragraph doesn't convince you, you can buy a lottery ticket.\n3、 Climbing speed\nIf you want to \"go up one level\" in your current social status, what speed and effort do you need?\nThe answer is hard, hard, hard, hard. It's much harder than you think.\nFirst of all, it should be noted that \"stratum\" is relative.\nThirty years ago everyone was poor. Everyone is very rich today. But that doesn't make you \"class\" up.\nTo rise, you have to be faster than average.\nHow fast is this going. According to the previous \"China's wealth\", the wealth growth of the whole society is about 24% per year\nThis is a desperate speed. In other words, in the past 37 years, China has a population of 1.3 billion, and everyone has performed better than Warren Buffet.\nEveryone's performance and return on investment are higher than Buffett. It is sustainable and large-scale. Among them, the outstanding ones, the upstarts, are far behind Bajun.\nWhat kind of God? Get out of here.\nIf you want to keep the \"class\" unchanged in the whole society, your wealth growth rate must reach 24% a year, every year.\nIf you still want to \"climb up\", you must be faster.\nFor example, suppose your speed is 33% a year, and your wealth increases. This is the speed of an astronomical rocket!\nAfter deducting 24% of the basic price, there is still 9% left;\nIt doubles about every eight years. It has increased by 300% in 13 years.\nIf you are so excellent, your wealth can keep increasing at a rate of 33%, and Buffett is crying faintly.\nAfter 13 years of rigorous and unremitting efforts. Your social status can be promoted one level among Chinese people. From a well-off society to a little rich.\nAfter 26 years of hard work, your class can be promoted to the second level. From a7.3 to a8.3.\nPick up the calculator and calculate the number carefully. It is really hopeless to calculate the return. Despair with no way to go.\nI have always admired the writers of some domestic \"struggle dramas\". The protagonists of the first 20 episodes are poor students and losers, who are very sour. In the last 20 episodes, the protagonist is a successful entrepreneur and a successful career. Hundreds of employees of A10 support each other and embrace the stars.\nThe middle five episodes are blank. How does the protagonist earn A9 and A10 in a few years and become a loser counter attack. The story is blank.\nThe real world, a7-a8-a9-a10, climbs up step by step. It is a long and boring process that is so boring that it takes decades.\nRomantic dramas don't tell you that.\n\n4、 The illusion of wealth\n\"Climbing the stairs\" is so hard, why do China's small white-collar workers have no feelings. Why are they so optimistic that they are full of hope.\nBecause of the illusion of wealth, especially the first 100 times. It greatly confuses human perception.\nFor a small white-collar, college student, if he comes from a small place in an inland province. His parents were exhausted after he finished college and could not provide more resources.\nWell, when he graduated from college, we can think he was A5. That is, the total net assets are 10000 yuan.\nBut such a college student, if he settled in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, would not be too stupid or lazy.\nThen, when he is 28, that is, six or seven years, he can save 1million yuan on average.\nIf the partners are harmonious and support each other, the speed can be faster.\nFor them, the leap of a5-a7 has been realized. That is to say, the first 100 times of life, and the rise of the entire four levels of social status, have been completed unconsciously.\nThis process is so smooth and easy that \"little white collars\" think that the second level is also very easy. They will continue to rise at this rate among the social strata. Therefore, they are bold and dare to shout \"the princes and generals are kind\".\nSo they were angry when they found that house prices were so expensive.\nSo they are angry when they find that the future life pressure is so heavy.\nThis is a trap for ordinary people, commonly known as the ceiling of wealth.\n5、 The ceiling of wealth\nThere are only a few positions for \"man on man\". Not everyone can rise indefinitely in the social stratum. Eventually there will be a force to stop them.\nSmall white-collar workers from A5 to A7 are a very smooth period of time, after which they will meet the wealth ceiling.\nWhy, we should start from the 24% growth rate of wealth.\nChina's development is too rapid. 24% is an unimaginable and unreasonable figure. Hardly anyone can keep up with this speed.\nWe know that the appreciation of wealth comes from two parts: one is your salary income, and the other is your financial income.\nWhen the \"net assets\" of small white-collar workers are very small, their salary income accounts for the absolute majority. Reflected in the rapid development of personal wealth. Work is everything.\nBut when they earned the first 100W and the first 200W, gradually, \"wealth accumulation\" began to increase. Financial management has become a big part.\nThe financial income of small white-collar workers is negative. Not only the small white-collar workers, but also the vast majority of people have negative financial returns.\nBecause of ordinary financial management, the homogenization is normal - the annual return is about 5%. Our inflation rate is around -15%.\nIn other words, your wealth accumulates savings and loses -10% every year\nThe wealth of the Chinese people is like a pool of water. While pouring water, that is your salary savings. The other side is leaking, which is the erosion of inflation.\nThe more assets you have, the faster the water leaks, and ultimately your wealth will never increase.\nWhat is the value of this \"ceiling\". Very easy to calculate.\nBecause your annual leakage rate is 10%, the final break even is 10 times PE.\nThat is, the maximum amount of wealth you can accumulate in your life is about 10 times your salary.\nSuppose a pair of hardworking white-collar workers. 35W yuan can be saved in one year. Then their upper limit of wealth is 3.5 million yuan.\nAfter that, they are still saving hard every year. Nominal deposits are increasing. But their accumulated purchasing power will stay at 350W yuan forever.\nTheir social status will always be a7.4 and will never be improved.\n6、 2n law\nThese are very simple principles. We all know the solution, so there is no need to repeat it.\nWe just want to talk about how to understand and deduce the \"2n law\".\nAs mentioned above, our national wealth is increasing by 9% every year and inflation is 14%, with a total of 24%\nIf you want to beat the wealth speed of the whole society, on the one hand, don't let your wealth shrink in inflation.\nOn the other hand, your physical wealth must increase by 9% every year\nSuppose you have 11 houses. Your square number must increase by 11*9%=1 set next year.\nGenerally speaking, we hope that your wealth can grow by 33% every year. That is 9%, 14% and 9%. In this way, you can not only keep up with the speed of social wealth. And it can \"climb up\". Upgrade every 13 years, which is the lowest speed.\nDriven by the two 9% requirements, if you have 11 houses, you must increase the square number by 11*18%=2 sets every year.\nThis is the origin of 2n theorem.\nWhy can't you change your class\n\"If you want to maintain the same class in the whole society, your wealth growth rate must reach 24% a year, every year. If you want to climb up, you must be faster.\"\nSo how can we achieve an annual return of +24%.\nThe answer is: No.\n1、 The mystery of reward\nIn the previous China's wealth, we said that the average growth rate of wealth in the whole society was +24%.\nEvery Chinese, 1.3 billion Chinese people, their wealth should increase by +24% every year, so that you will not be eliminated by the society.\nNow the question is, how can we achieve +24% annualized return.\nI thought it over. It's hard.\nNot \"hard\". It is impossible.\nOur entire investment market is called \"mass market\". The general return on investment in this market is 5%. Maybe it can be higher, but it has to take extra risks. The substance is almost the same.\nOf course, you can say that you are the God of stocks or the God of buildings. Perhaps far more than the average market return. But the thing of licking blood at the edge of the knife can not be done for a lifetime after all. You can't win, and you can't be legendary every year.\nThe risk-free return is 5%. How can you ask others for a 24% return. The immortal can't do it.\nSuppose we relax the conditions a bit. In addition to capital gains, there is also wage income.\nAnd the salary income is always equal to 9% of your \"total assets\"\nThis is a ridiculous request. If you have 100million, you have to have 9million after tax annual salary. This is almost impossible.\nSuppose you have 10million. You have to earn 900000 a year. This is almost impossible.\nBut even so. Your wealth growth rate still can not keep up with 24%.\nEvery year, your asset growth is only 5%+9%=14%.\nOne piece is still missing. Ten percent is missing. Where is the mystery.\n2、 Vanishing wealth\nThe income of \"financial management + labor\" is accumulated, but it is still only 14%. The wealth of the whole society has increased by 24%, and there is still a missing link. Where has it gone.\nThe remaining one is in Beijing.\nThe rest is called \"power\".\nIn our textbooks, diligent parents will never teach you a truth or tell you a fact;\n\"Production + robbery\" is the two main lines. Where there is interest, there is robbery.\nThey will never tell you that the real world we live in is actually two battlefields.\nOne is \"Wen\". Production, manufacturing and labor trade generate wealth through industry and commerce. Free exchange.\nOne is \"Wu\". The core of this battlefield is \"power\". The struggle is for control of the government. It's about robbing stolen goods. It's filthy and bloody.\nWe can often hear that some upstarts have emerged in Beijing. In the previous two years, he set up a stall on the overpass. He was a billionaire and bought dozens of Companies in a row.\nAs we all know, there are \"money masters\" in Beijing. These Mermaid dragons are mixed among the major ministries and commissions. Their energy is amazing. They eat hundreds of thousands of yuan per meal.\nWe know that \"in three years of Qing Dynasty, 100000 snowflakes and silver\". Although the officials in Beijing are not well-known, they are definitely on the Forbes rich list.\nWe used to think that these are very distant things. Although corrupt officials are bad, they are thousands of miles away from our lives. There is no direct impact, just a kind of talk on TV.\nHowever, when you find that the monetary wealth of the whole society has developed rapidly at a rate of +24%. In your own hands, no matter how hard you try, your wealth will increase by +14% at most every year. Have you ever thought about what makes you so poor?\nYou and your little friends are equal to the same efforts, the same diligence and the same fight.\nYou think you've worked hard enough. There is no one more diligent than you.\nHowever, 1300km away, there is a capital. It produces billionaires in batches like laying eggs. creating something out of nothing\nSo, how can your rank in the whole society not decline.\n3、 Operation of power\nWe live in a society with a total income of three yuan, which is 24% in total.\nA) If you are a retired person, you only have interest financial income. Then your wealth growth rate is only +5%. You will be eliminated quickly. No retiree in China can be a rich man. No rich second generation can maintain wealth.\nB) If you are a salaried person. You have two incomes, financial management 5%+ salary 9%, and your annual wealth can increase by 14%. The wealth class stops at the ceiling.\nC) If you have access to power. You only have three incomes, financial management 5%+ salary 9%+ power 10%, so that your wealth can increase by +24%\nEvery year, Beijing takes 10% of its total wealth from the whole society and Chinese people. And to those close to him.\nThe specific method, in view of the fact that nestle coffee is more delicious. We won't start. Just remember that there has always been a saying in officialdom: \"the central government relies on finance, local governments rely on land, and the grassroots rely on fines.\".\nOur life is the \"civil and military\" two battlefields. As a battlefield of power, if you gain nothing, your upper income limit is +14%, and you can no longer keep up with the steps of the whole society.\nBeijing distributes 10% of the wealth of the whole society every year. This is a huge cake. You must not turn a blind eye to it.\nLet's spend some time on it.\nThe so-called \"running to work\". For such a large sum of money, the central government must first distribute it among the provinces. There are some traditional \"political provinces\". Its resources are far out of proportion to the population. The first place must be the imperial capital, followed by Shandong, Shanghai and Guangdong.\nWhen a province gets the funds, it has to distribute them within the province. The provincial capital cities will undoubtedly get the biggest share. Prefecture level cities take the second place. When we arrived at counties, towns and townships, few of them had been intercepted.\nWhen a prefectural Party secretary gets project funds from the national development and Reform Commission, he will find a group of his subordinates. Divide the project into projects and bid sections.\nFor each bid section, you are responsible for civil works and he is responsible for bridge and tunnel works. Among them, there are precise and sharp interest positions. Innumerable plots at the dinner table and changes in each project section are enough to trigger bloodshed and assassination.\nThis is a huge net. Countless people and interest groups depend on the government for food. In this 10% distribution of national wealth, bayonets see blood, kill each other and cheat each other.\nNo, we are not advocating that you become a civil servant. It tells you that competition is everywhere.\nIn this \"Military\" battlefield, the fighting is as fierce as it is difficult. Being an official, like other industries, is a matter of averaging profits. It's hard to rise to the top.\n4、 Conclusion\nTianwei Fuyuan, in this feast of \"power distribution\", even the subordinates' subordinates' subordinates are gods you can't touch. For example, if you want to have dinner with the son of the prefectural Party Secretary, most people are not qualified.\nIf you want him to hand over the business to you, it will be even worse.\nHowever, we have no chance to fall behind this 10%. No, in fact, what we want to be is a \"shovel seller\", a wealth setter.\nInflation is like a drop of water. Beijing first created inflation throughout the country and gathered more than ten trillion paper dollars in the Empire.\nThen, the first round of beneficiaries are the sons of ministries and commissions, state-owned enterprises and the state.\nThe beneficiaries of the second round are upstream and downstream manufacturers. And selling luxury goods to the first circle.\nThe beneficiaries of the third round are upstream and downstream manufacturers of the second round. And selling luxury goods to the second circle.\n……\nWealth, like drops of water, spreads outward in circles. Many people, even if they are not in the power field, but as long as your registered residence is Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, you are the beneficiary. Is a strong citizen.\nFor example, because there is too much quick money in Beijing, it is easy to get. That's why so many e-businesses have been cultivated. Only then can there be an IT industry supported by burning money, and only then can there be high wages for apps and programmers.\nBecause Beijing has more money, it has driven the consumption industry. Clothing, catering and health care are flourishing in an all-round way.\nBecause Beijing has a lot of money, the construction of the National Grand Theater and the grand theater can change with each passing day at a dazzling speed.\nBecause corrupt officials have made money, there are only a few cities in the country that deserve their attention. So the money will only be invested in a few cities, not the national average.\nIf you live in Daliangshan, Sichuan, you are the weak in the power field. The upper limit of the development accumulation rate is 14%. You are doomed to be poor all your life at the macro level.\nIf you join the officialdom, you will become sworn brothers with the son of the Secretary of the prefectural Party committee. Then you may become very rich. The return of power is dozens of times, hundreds of times, not 30%. But this road is not easy. It's faster to die.\nIf you live in some politically powerful cities, you specialize in the business of \"sworn brothers\" and sell shovels to them. Then you can also share the benefits of power indirectly. Although not violent, at least it is the stability of civilians.", "timestamp": 1654531341, "digest": "-03BGdo1MHl9uCB8II-A-MUoeYjhN5n-Zn0kjVrSXi0", "contributor": "0xbc9d291231ce6ec0c109170FaF9F806331BdB6Ff"}
{"id": "TwVlazHz1bzWsAMDZb8Oid4ZcxfKdlBLJuSRL0oDwJ0", "title": "People who are born better than you work harder than you. What should we do?", "body": "Recently, jinkeyu, daughter of jinliqun, interim Secretary General of the Asian investment bank, has become a topic figure. She has been labeled as \"born better than you, smarter than you, and harder than you\". Such a bully is enough to make most people feel that they don't know how to deal with themselves, or even feel uncomfortable. How to view this phenomenon?\nPeople who seem to be less successful may be due to a lot of efforts to overcome \"birth\"\nIt is indeed admirable that Xueba comes from a good family background, but it cannot be denied that \"good family background\" is often the reason why he becomes a Xueba.\nArticles that raise topics, This is how Jin Keyu was introduced: \"She is proficient in English, French, Spanish and Italian; she loves literature and art, and her piano and clarinet skills have reached the professional level; she has completed all undergraduate courses at Harvard in only two years; at the age of 25, she received a doctorate in Harvard economics... In 83, she is now the youngest professor of macroeconomics at the London School of political economy; and her father is a former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance and a former director of CICC Mr. Jin Liqun, the current head of aiib. \"\nThe article also deliberately emphasizes the influence of jinliqun on her daughter: \"Thanks to his father's strong literary complex and good English education at home, when he was still in junior high school attached to the National People's Congress, he read all the original works of Shakespeare, and then went to harrisman high school in New York to continue his studies. Of the 14 partners in his class, 12 got admitted to Harvard, and the remaining two received notices from Stanford and Princeton respectively. In that year, he graduated with the first total score of harrisman high school, and went to Harvard to study Learn. \"\nRegardless of whether the above introduction is flattering or not, only from the hard indicators such as \"Harvard\" and \"the youngest professor\", Jin Keyu's achievements, according to the general social cognition, are enough to \"kill\" 99.9% of the people. As a result, many people inevitably have such a view, \"a person with such a good background can live well without any effort, but I am ashamed of her efforts to achieve such achievements.\". Part of the reason for this recognition is that compared with the well-known images of the second generation of officials and the second generation of rich people, Jin Keyu is so different that many people subconsciously do not attribute his success to his family background.\nOf course, this understanding is biased. It is normal for a well-off family whose parents have a higher education level to require their children to receive a higher education and show it in the form of paying attention to their children's learning, giving them more encouragement, and willing to invest in education for their children. Of course, there are many cases of overindulgence and children's failure to live up to their expectations, such as the Li Shuangjiang family. Because this situation is more topical, people tend to ignore it. Examples such as Jin Liqun's cultivation of Jin Keyu may be the majority. One evidence is that every summer, more than 100000 Chinese students come from China to the United States to experience American life and culture, some of whom are only 10 years old. Most of their ambitions are to enter the best schools in the United States. In fact, many people have succeeded. For example, Jin Keyu's alma mater, the high school attached to the National People's Congress, has long been a well-known \"preparatory school for studying in the United States\". Most of the parents of these people are relatively affluent senior intellectuals.\nIt is natural that family background is helpful to the success of children, but the resulting differences should be eliminated\nIs the correlation between family background and children's success reasonable? To a large extent, of course, it is reasonable. However, some people have pointed out the irrationality in a burst of blood. Xi Ru, a well-known Douban netizen, wrote in an article, \"those who seem to be less successful do not lack the same smart efforts, but when they make the same (or even more) smart efforts, some of them need to be used to 'overcome' their origins.\". Such footnotes can be found everywhere. For example, students with ordinary family background are often not comparable with students with superior family background in \"vision\" and \"insight\". Some netizens describe such differences——\n\"Also in 985 and 211 universities, I have many students from ordinary families who simply don't know what direction to strive for and what possibilities will be in the future besides studying hard. We have wasted all our time in the self-study room. In the end, the best thing is to escort our graduate students. However, there are students from highly knowledgeable families around us. Since they entered the University, they have worked hard to participate in the student union, news agency, class competition, writing papers, and participating in the exchange of life activities In the end, they went far away than us. We used to think that going to college was just running together, but it was not. It was like fitness. The effect of your own practice was very different from that of having a coach around you. \"\nIs this difference reasonable? It can be taken for granted that highly educated families and wealthy families know better how to educate their children and devote more to their children's education. Who doesn't want their children to excel and live better than others? This difference is inevitable unless families are abolished. Some people may envy Plato's philosopher Kingdom, where the state raises and educates every baby, but it is obviously just a utopia.\nHowever, it must be pointed out that the family background causes the difference between people. This reason is reasonable. It can not explain that the result is reasonable - obviously, this will lead to the solidification of the stratum, allowing the rich to form a cycle of wealth and the poor to form a cycle of poverty - because they can't even use knowledge to break the difference. This will obviously destroy the vitality of a society and lead to various social problems. Therefore, the basic ideas of many countries in terms of education policies are \"don't let a child fall behind\" and \"let the child be on the same starting line\". The education equality mentioned here does not mean the equality of national education resources investment - because the investment of family education resources has been very different - but the equality of educational efficiency.\nAt present, the way to break the \"different origins\" is the college entrance examination, but there are already many problems\nIn China, the biggest way to achieve equal educational efficiency is the college entrance examination. Through this relatively fair selection scheme, students from high-tech, rich families and students from poor families can compete on the same starting line, so that there will not be a big gap in their future. However, regardless of the unfair distribution of quotas, different examination papers in different regions, and the inability to achieve the college entrance examination in key regions, the college entrance examination has become more and more inadequate in regulating educational equality.\nAnhui Maotanchang middle school, which is famous for China on the tip of the tongue, is a clear proof. This huge high school, known as the \"college entrance examination factory\", has given ordinary students the opportunity to \"test too high and be handsome\" and \"defeat the second generation of officials\" by means of \"military management\", \"banning all entertainment\", \"sea test tactics\" and \"parents' hard study\", but this is at the expense of the best years of life and buried in exam oriented education.\nThe same type of high school also has the famous Hebei Hengshui middle school. As far as the college entrance examination is concerned, this is a top middle school, no less than the high school attached to the National People's Congress where Jin Keyu is located. Every year, as many as 100 people can be admitted to Tsinghua and Peking University. However, there is great doubt about the sustainability of the talents created by the \"Hengshui model\". Compared with the large number of well-known alumni of the high school attached to the National People's Congress and Beijing No. 4 middle school, Hengshui middle school seems to have never published the follow-up survey results of graduates. Some netizens questioned that \"no one knows the admission rate of hengzhong graduates' postgraduate entrance examination, Bao Yan admission rate, judicial examination pass rate, national examination pass rate, Ivy League full scholarship rate and public school pass rate.\"\nXiongbingqi, a well-known education expert, also believes that, It is necessary to make a follow-up survey of students from Hengshui middle school who went to Tsinghua University and Peking University—— \"If the tracking data of Peking University and Tsinghua University on the students of Hengshui middle school from enrollment, four years of study to university, and graduation shows that the graduates of Hengshui middle school have strong adaptability to university, their academic performance is still excellent in Peking University and Tsinghua University, and their innovation awareness and cooperation ability are not inferior to other students, then the criticism of Hengshui middle school should be adjusted to analyze the merits of its education and teaching management; on the contrary, if Hengshui middle school Graduates, after entering the University, have disappeared from the public. So if they agree with scholars in Hengshui, they should reflect. If they are admitted to a famous university at all costs, they will consider it a success in life and career. Is it just a bubble? \"\nThe attention Jin Keyu received magnified the embarrassment of Hengshui middle school and Maotanchang middle school.\nMoreover, the times are advancing, and the college entrance examination has become less and less decisive for a person's future. What else can we do to make students from ordinary families counter attack?\nTo solve the problem, the state needs to increase investment in education, especially training more excellent teachers\nIn the 1960s, the United States once launched an educational affirmative action movement, whose theoretical basis came from the famous Coleman report. The conclusions of this report are as follows: the order of important factors affecting academic achievement is as follows: first, students' family economic and cultural background; Second, the quality of teachers; Third, school facilities and courses.\nAs mentioned above, the influence of family economic and cultural background on one's academic achievement is the most important, but this difference is inevitable; With the development of social productivity, school facilities and curriculum have been improving, and the difference has been small. What the state can and should do to enable children to stand on the same starting line is to improve the quality of teachers and reasonably allocate teacher resources.\nIn addition, it is also a possible policy choice to establish a public service Academic Help Center for children to provide educational tutoring support for students from socially disadvantaged families and poor academic performance. In the UK, the government pays for the establishment of breakfast clubs and after-school clubs in community service centers or libraries to provide computers and learning materials for children from disadvantaged families. Provide \"one-on-one tutoring\" for children who receive free lunch to improve their academic performance. In the United States, the government provides educational compensation to children from low-income families through the \"after school program\". We can also learn from the practice of developed countries to provide free tutoring and tutoring to the children of vulnerable groups based on schools to help them overcome their academic difficulties. The necessary funds can be paid by government taxes.\nepilogue\n\"Schools should not only provide equal educational resources, but also protect students from inequality caused by birth and social environment\" - quoted from Coleman report. At a time when a super school bully like Jin Keyu is attracting attention, we should be more clear about what is the true meaning of \"keeping children on the same starting line\".", "timestamp": 1654531422, "digest": "3QUTXJ23YhTypb5NvlK0xZQnCfiEZsEXDL8Ylmrr12I", "contributor": "0xBBA0c59BA543683A2191efe85Fb691cf387E4364"}

With no desire and no satisfaction, everyone is struggling at various levels and becomes impatient with life. However, there is still a difference between people on this point, that is, whether this anxiety can be controlled within a reasonable range. The basic life that can be controlled is good, and the life that cannot be controlled is a mess. To a large extent, controlling anxiety also controls life.\nThe reason why the newly graduated college student had insomnia all night was that he had decided not to find a job before continuing his postgraduate entrance examination. But suddenly he did not know why. More and more advice he heard from his seniors and sisters was \"don't aim too high. It is the right way to get a job slowly\". He felt that they were right, and began to doubt whether his \"ready to learn more\" mentality was unrealistic, so he began to worry.\nThe company employees who have been working steadily have come to a \"walk away\" trip and want to find themselves in the trip. The reasons are: the stable jobs are introduced by their parents to acquaintances, not what they like; However, I didn't know anything about the wine business I wanted to engage in. I didn't know how to start. I didn't dare to take the first step. As a result, I was particularly grumpy at work and finally offended the leaders.\nEven in love, you must be anxious before you pay attention to it. It seems that everything without anxiety is not worth mentioning. Even myself sometimes become anxious: should I stick to writing the types I am good at, or should I try to develop new types in a timely manner? After all, my major is screenwriting. Now IP is booming. Do you want to take a share? Should we cooperate with the same company or with several more companies? The former is out of moral factors and long-term interests, while the latter is to expand more channels. But at the same time, I also know that these anxieties are useless, because in the end I can only choose one of them.\nAfter a lot of anxious choices, my own lesson is that all anxiety is useless. There is no such thing as careful consideration in two similar things. There is no way to judge the future through imagination and speculation. The road is all self-made, not inferred by referring to others' appearance. No matter how well others do something, no matter how wonderful the method is, when you change it, it will become another appearance, which is equivalent to a new road.\nThere is no better way in the world, but there is the best way - that is, the way you have chosen and are determined to go. Even if outsiders don't like it, even if you doubt it, you are always moving forward. There is only one life, and there is only one way to grow and live. There is no difference between good and bad. They are unique and need to have choices. For this reason, everyone's life is accidental, determined by one choice.\nI can't tell whether you need to take the exam for another year or find a job to accumulate experience. Which will be better and which will be more suitable for you? No, no one can give you the answer, even you can't. The only way is to choose one of them and stick to it. But you must believe that these two roads are the same. There is no difference between good and bad. There are thorns and flowers. If you choose, go straight ahead without looking back.\nI can't persuade you to lose the job introduced by an acquaintance and engage in the wine business you love. This is not a relationship between dream and reality, but only related to your choice. I don't think you will be happy if you do the wine business, and you will do better than this stable job.\nFirst, allow the existence of anxiety, which is a normal emotion; Secondly, it is useless to understand anxiety, which will only increase troubles and do all kinds of harm without any benefit. There is no choice but under the guise of \"careful consideration\"; Finally, no matter what method is adopted, even if it is to draw lots, choose a road and kneel down to finish it.

{"id": "LMvhGFLuhvOcztOIsemr8tB1YUs17hgTaN_DPSE1I6k", "title": "数据解析：NFT 钻石手动向，分布和投资策略", "body": "近期，数字资产市场的宏观变化，也对 NFT 市场带来了冲击。根据 NFTGo.io 数据，目前，NFT 市场情绪较为冷淡。\n\n![ NFT市场情绪；数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E8sGbKC4vLDkU3pfkaQ7.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n在 NFT 市场交易量波动下滑之际，很多人纷纷卖出他们 NFT，清空仓位。然而，市场上依旧也有一些坚定的持有者。本文将探析 NFT 市场的数据指标之一：钻石手持有者（Diamond Hand Holder）。在进一步探究此模型之前，我们需要先回答一下以下几个问题：\n\n* 谁是钻石手？\n* 钻石手的投资策略是什么？\n* 钻石手是如何看待当前市场情绪变化的？\n\n## 数据样本与方法论\n\n我们收集了市值排名前20的Collection作为数据样本，这些Collection的总市值占据了超70%的NFT市场市值。在顶级Collection多样化的数据样本的基础上，我们尝试建立适用于整个NFT市场的无差异数据分析指标。\n\n### 早期投资者曲线（Early Adopter Curve）\n\n想要合理预测NFT走势，离不开对新兴评估指标的研究和应用。NFT市场以Meme和故事背景为驱动力，因此，评估指标的首要任务之一便是全面而准确地反映出当下NFT圈内的流行趋势。\n\n早期投资者曲线是反映NFT Collection动态趋势的一大重要指标。如初创公司和新产品一般，NFT也需要早期投资者们组成的蜂窝网络来打开市场。蜂窝网络在很大程度上定义了一个NFT社区的文化氛围。有了这样一批早期用户，再加上优秀的开发团队，NFT项目便由此迈出了第一步。\n\n如果顺利，这个蜂窝网络会自我复制，发展成为一个更庞大的蜂窝网络。这也是NFT领域中许多蓝筹Collection的成功之路。\n\n一切都是从最初的一批人开始的。\n\n### 钻石手\n\n我们观察发现，通常情况下，在NFT发行不久后，蜂窝网络中的Minters会倾向于快速买卖他们在前期铸造的NFT。虽然很难获得夸张的盈利，但是交易风险率很低，这种交易者被称为纸手。钻石手是指那些长期看好并坚定持有某一项目的NFT、在波动中能扛住风险并最终获得较高收益的群体。\n\n然而，对于一个Collection来说，少部分长期持仓（HODL）的Minter们，往往也是最有价值的社区成员。钻石手就是这样一群有着长期投资视野的策略投资人。通过链上交易历史，如果某 NFT 的链上交易历史记录包含任何被买卖行为，我们就不将其持有地址视为钻石手，反之，则是钻石手。（由于持有者往往有多个钱包，我们包括了钻石手将他们的 NFT 转移到其他地址账户（即 NFT Vault）的情况。）\n\n庞大的钻石手群体代表了项目早期投资者对社区的高度认同和集体意识。在我们的数据样本中，Meebits、CloneX、CryptoPunks和Moonbirds的持有者中，钻石手的比重较大，与普通持有者（Normal Holder）的比率也较为惊人。由于有些项目发行时间较短，钻石手比例较高。我们根据NFT项目在二级市场上的存活期进行了分类，具体数据见下图：\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-ay0UkaYIhmDDAsrMxIST.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n成为钻石手绝非易事，一方面需要在前期有对潜力蓝筹项目的判断能力，另一方面也需要经历 NFT 行业的周期性下跌。通过数据统计，我们发现，平均每五个持有者中才出现一个钻石手。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZLdmWiL3Jd2irUrxFOMkE.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n在数据样本中，BAYC、Azuki、Pudgy Penguins和Doodles等一些项目相比较前面的几个项目钻石手比重较小。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5TOQqqRTPh9VWBEfaxfWV.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n各Collection之间钻石手分布情况各异，但我们可以看到，其实钻石手比重与Collection的市场表现并无很强的直接关系，也存在部分钻石手比重较小但市场表现斐然的Collection。下图是部分市值排名较高Collection的钻石手的占比统计。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/38vWc68jCkxL7aT7KGVdG.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n从上图中，我们发现，一些项目如Moonbirds是由著名NFT团队/持有者创立的，且创立时间较短，此外，Meetbits和Moonbirds也都经历了原始项目给予 free mint 的阶段，钻石手含量也相对较高。BAYC和Azuki等项目不是从创立之初便广受市场欢迎的，而是随着发展慢慢走入人们的视野从而得到认同的。在这一过程中，许多早期的铸造者过早地退出了项目，现如今，也无法再享受该项目带来的增值红利。\n\n## 牛市与熊市\n\n在下文中，我们将分成以下几个部分，深入学习探究这些钻石手们的投资组合：\n\n* 蓝筹钻石手的投资趋势\n* 钻石手的投资策略\n* 有哪些Alpha？\n\n**揭秘钻石手的投资组合**\n\n我们分别对BAYC、Meebits、CloneX、World Of Women和Doodles几个蓝筹Collection中钻石手的投资组合架构进行了分析。经过一段时间的发展，这些Collection都在NFT市场中取得了不小的成功，而作为最早一批入股的投资者们，通过持仓NFT资产，钻石手们也见证了这些Collection一路走来的发展。\n\n钻石手对其所投资的Collection有着极强的信念感。尽管人数不多，但他们却被视为最具策略性的NFT投资人，发掘NFT市场中的长期潜在利润，也这正是基于这一点，钻石手成为了我们了解NFT Alpha的最佳方式，帮助我们从中探知到许多 Alpha 信息。\n\n首先，我们分析了不同Collection下钻石手的投资组合架构，并对上述5个Collection中蓝筹钻石手对其他顶级Collection的持有情况进行了总结。\n\n为了获得更加准确的分析数据，我们收集了每个钻石手对不同Collection的持有量数据，并计算了每个Collection的在钻石手社区中的出现频率。\n\n据统计，BAYC共有钻石手338名，在这些钻石手的投资组合中，涉及到的其余独立NFT Collection总量超过1777个。但实际上在所有的这些Collection中，大部分Collection仅拥有一到两名钻石手持有者。根据钻石手对不同Collection的持有情况，我们可以将其分成以下三类：\n\n* Alpha\n* Beta\n* Gamma\n\n我们把某个Collection中，50%以上钻石手所持有的其他Collection称为Alpha，这类Collection十分稀有，并且具有极高的实用价值。30%-50%钻石手共同持有的Collection被称为Beta，而那些只有20%-30%钻石手持有的Collection被称为Gamma。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HqNG-Z4L0JknUvqIcOuMD.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n以BAYC为例，在上述1777个Collection中，仅有16家有交叉持有。具体分布请见下图。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T9rsLcky_PG03SEiZ4BZb.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n数据显示，在BAYC的钻石手中，有20%-30%持有Bonsai和Parallel Alpha等NFT Collection，30%-50%持有Otherdeed、Sandbox和Art Blocks，而持有ENS的钻石手的数量超过了60%，占据主导地位。\n\n这套评估标准也同样适用于其他蓝筹Collection。例如，我们分析发现，Doodles钻石手的数据也呈现出相同的趋势，持有ENS的投资者占据了主导地位，而Beta和Gamma的情况也与BAYC极为相似。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SHrM9Ryf80nLLMMktXGkC.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n而在World Of Women中，Art Blocks仅位列Gamma梯队。World Of Women Galaxy是World Of Women Galaxy的二代衍生Collection，由其钻石手社区中的181名成员创立。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EKGBK2H2RXrFABCaLnSPI.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n然而，Doodles和World Of Women的钻石手群体中，持有Collection发生重合的情况，较BAYC来说相对较少，而重合越少，说明钻石手的投资策略也越多样化。CloneX钻石手的投资重合仅发生在Beta类的Collection中，并且，5个Collection中有4个与CloneX同属于一个开发团队出品的项目。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TQEKW8ZHEn5bgo5J2GZND.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n目前，CryptoPunks的Alpha类型中出现了Meebits和ENS两个Collection。\n\n![数据来源：NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ATP64beR1zrGTDvgXwaFZ.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n**ENS和Art Blocks**\n\n我们对5个蓝筹Collection钻石手的投资组合进行了深入研究，经过分析发现，ENS的出现频率很高，没有跌出过Alpha和Beta两个类别。可以看出，大多数钻石手都拥有自己的ENS域名。在过去几周中，[ENS价格也经历了飙升](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU2MzQzMzEwNg==&mid=2247485510&idx=1&sn=d8ec86bfe6f176b545cc7dbd7d95fd63&chksm=fc5b13bbcb2c9aadcc125958b5e69200f5338d60983914c2ba820bbbb1e24a8f53495f0eb60e&scene=21#wechat_redirect)。此外，在结果中，Art Blocks较为频繁地出现，在我们所分析的5个Collection中，其中3个Collection中，Art Blocks有高达20%以上的钻石手持有率。Art Blocks通过\"随机艺术品\"的概念，可以铸造你所喜欢的艺术家同风格的NFT，是当下热门的**生成类艺术品项目之一**。\n\n### 空投效应\n\n一般来说，开发团队会不定期给持有者社区投放一些新NFT，身为持有者中品牌忠诚度最高的一类用户，无论是在估值高峰还是在市场低谷，钻石手都乐意持有一部分NFT，即使这些NFT是从项目方那里免费获得的。通过观察我们发现，CryptoPunks、RTFKT和World Of Women几个项目中的许多投资者甚至至今仍保留着部分空投获得的NFT。\n\n## 结语\n\n本文中，我们分析研究了不同NFT项目中钻石手的分布情况，发现其呈现出较为明显的差异性。同时也揭示了，作为经验丰富的投资者，这些钻石手是如何在NFT市场的牛熊期中调整自身的投资组合架构的。最后，我们还研究了钻石手社区中的投资趋势，分析了不同Collection中钻石手对其他NFT项目投资的重合情况。\n\n一段时间以来，NFT一直处于盘整期，市场上也有一些用户希望一夜暴富，还有一部分用户并不看好NFT市场，认为从长期发展来看，必定会出现泡沫破裂。相反，钻石手会在熊市的时候 HODL，成为看到NFT市场宏大未来的长期战略持有者。\n\n \n \n\n*注释：本文仅供研究使用。投资数字资产（如NFT和数字资产）会有风险，在做出任何投资决定前，请务必咨询财务顾问。NFTGo不提供投资建议，不对任何因投资数字资产造成的损失负责。 \n *", "timestamp": 1654531627, "digest":

{"id": "PU_UO4G2UZonh2xXJJEBMNTAQLKtj1nRosf7SbRsOzo", "title": "Mediocrity or not is just the devil in your heart", "body": "In modern society, there are many smart people, but too few reliable people. In terms of intelligence, in fact, everyone's IQ is basically the same. Some people are slightly higher, but they are all in the same range, except for a few people with relatively high IQ. Whether smart or not is more often reflected in a person's acceptance of new things and processing ability.\nWhether in China or the west, in society, a person's ability is very important, but there is one thing more important than ability, that is, character, which is the basic judgment of whether a person is reliable.\nIn fact, children educated in China are generally more intelligent because of complex social and interpersonal relationships. In addition to normal studies, I have to deal with all kinds of complex affairs when I leave the campus and enter the workplace. Over time, I will naturally become more \"smart\" when I stay in the big dye vat for a long time.\nJudging from the general phenomenon, smart people have good abilities, but not all of them are reliable, that is, their character is not always guaranteed. Not all reliable people are not smart, and they also have very good abilities. Intelligence and reliability, or ability and character, are a pair of wings. Without one, you can't fly high and far.\nOften, it is normal for people to like smart people. In life, they often keep in touch, but not all of them are willing to be intimate friends with smart people. Instead, they are willing to be intimate friends with people who are good and reliable. A smart person has too many hidden things and too many variables. You don't know what he / she really thinks. Even if you know it, you can't / won't reveal it (in fact, everyone's IQ is similar. Don't think you're smart). Sometimes you have to guard against it. It's really tiring.\nBecause of a new project, recruiting is a headache. We recruited two different types of people, a and C, and made a full comparison. The fact proved that the character is still the first, and the ability can be cultivated slowly. Nowadays, most people have high goals but low hands.\nHowever, it is often forgotten that what can do great things starts from solving small things. Large companies start from small companies, and you grow up from a baby. Nothing is directly ready-made, except that you have the ability and strength to be competent for the position you want, but all this is through the necessary time. Rome wasn't built in a day.\nHalf a year ago, after meeting a and B (both are girls), I spent about 10 minutes to make a decision. A I used to work as an accountant in a company. I wanted to change my job. I didn't know anything about new media, Internet and mobile Internet. I was 30 years old, married, had a child and couldn't drive. B. He has just graduated from University, is 20 years old, unmarried, seems to be good at new things, and can drive.\nThe reason why I want a is very simple. Although she is 30 years old, married and has a child, she is not good at emerging industries. It seems a little weak, but this is precisely an important factor for the long-term stability of a girl in the workplace. She must be more responsible because she at least has a sense of family responsibility. These are very important considerations for a company, because it is not easy to cultivate a person (later, a post-90s girl was recruited, and she is also very good. As a result, she has just been trained, and said she would get married. I fully understand, but I am very helpless).\nA can also be a company accountant, which is an absolute bonus. If she can't drive, let her learn to drive (all skills can be learned). She can learn new business even if she is not familiar with it. Facts have proved that she is also a smart person. In two months, she has learned to use it all. She is more efficient than me and the effect is better than me. Give her a task that won't bother you and will be handled properly.\nAnother important factor for me to hire her is that she still has faith (this is not the standard for hiring, but it must be a big bonus, and not all companies have the same view). This factor will be clearly reflected in the future work process.\nOnce, when she was paying her salary, she gave her an extra amount. She immediately left a message saying whether it was wrong and the amount was too much. I said, that's the number. On another occasion, I arranged for her to help a friend edit and typeset the manuscript to be sent. The friend was very polite and directly sent her a red envelope. She was scared and sent the red envelope back, but my friend didn't answer. As a result, she said to me, \"the red envelope should be given to you first, and then you should return it to your friend.\" I said, \"it doesn't matter. You can take the red envelope as a reward. It should be.\" She replied, \"I'm sorry.\"\nAlthough these numbers are not large, these little things can judge a person's character. I believe that such an honest character is based on her firm belief. In dealing with these details, I see her more reliable, and slowly hand over other things to her. She can still handle things very well. Her ability has been trained in small things. When she has the ability that others do not have, she will naturally be competitive.\nIn contrast, C, male, post-90s, fresh graduates, have no relevant industry background (also cross industry). Although they are willing to learn new things, they are more impetuous, belonging to the kind of high minded, low skilled and ambitious. Many times, the tasks assigned to him are handled quickly, but the quality is very poor. Without paying attention to his work tasks, he wanted to get things done quickly. He couldn't keep calm and was not down-to-earth enough. He tried to think about some high-profile affairs and a high-profile lifestyle (there was nothing wrong with thinking, but his mind was in the wrong place).\nAlthough the pace of society is very fast, we should do things in a down-to-earth manner. Doing things well is the premise, and speed is not the goal. It doesn't matter to be slow at first, but it will be faster when you become proficient later. That's how practice makes perfect. After many times of this situation, I talked to him in depth for many times.\nThe last time I told him that if it was inappropriate, I could go to other places (because the atmosphere of our work is very relaxed, and everyone who has read our recruitment advertisement knows it). If the other party doesn't want you, or you don't adapt to the new company, you can come back. Because we try to give young people more opportunities to correct some of their wrong attitudes and values when they enter the workplace. They are all from the past. I hope the newcomers can make a smooth career path, at least in good connection with their own life planning.\nToday's young people are really in a hurry. The dominant position of society today is basically in the hands of the elders after the 50s, 60s and 70s, including various resource relationships. They are our uncles and uncles. Imagine that when you become an uncle or uncle of others, no matter how stupid you are, you will also have corresponding social resources and relationships at that age.\nYoung people should first do well what they should do and try to be beautiful. There are at least oneortwo cases that they can handle. I have a good friend who didn't go to college seriously, but with his own interest and persistence, I had the opportunity to write an industry book (Internal Journal) with others. With this, I entered Ogilvy & Mather public relations, and then quickly became a middle and senior level, and then I did my own business. This is a very inspiring story.\nThe workplace is different from the campus. It needs to generate benefits. The knowledge learned on campus often can not be directly transformed into productivity. So you can't start with a proud attitude, which is not good for entering the workplace. When your pay and your benefits are not equal, or your competitiveness is not enough, you should have a sense of crisis.\nHow to improve your professional skills is the most important thing for newcomers, rather than thinking about more salary increases. When your ability is in place, your salary will come up naturally. You create performance for the company. No boss doesn't like it unless the boss has no vision or kindness. If that happens, you can be bold and open with the boss. If you don't get the right treatment, you can choose to find another job (because not all bosses talk about Humanization).\nI wish young friends would know the real positive significance of doing things in a down-to-earth and reliable manner. We should firmly believe that in the near future, years and bole will not mistreat you with the sense of steadiness and reliability emanating from our hearts.", "timestamp": 1654531553, "digest": "q2Erg19BABq8zN_OwpODQ0kAS63t5qSxJuvvhcVP1x0", "contributor": "0x8796d9D9b0a65e50FD1953F861cB3736c65ea9D9"}
{"id": "_tVYumkjkgHbL-84i4ntkGU1OU4hGrwiv-TpHls5UHE", "title": "Don't listen to people who don't read tell you that reading is useless", "body": "Because I am in the manufacturing industry, I often meet all kinds of people, including underworld, officials, factory employees and office white-collar workers. Their income is not high, ranging from 3000 to 7000 a month, but this level is not low in China.\nNot to mention the boss, since China's accession to the WTO, foreign trade has ushered in unprecedented opportunities. With a net worth of less than 10 million, they are embarrassed to say that they have done foreign trade.\nHere, from the boss to the employees, from the guests to the acquaintances, you can always experience such a tendency. Sometimes when we talk, we say, \"Hey, reading is not so useful. Look at you.\" After reading so many books, you didn't end up working with your boss\n\n1. People like to talk about wealth, but they don't want to hold up books\n   Some colleagues wanted to speculate in stocks. I recommended him to read some books, and then returned them to me intact. Compared with these, they prefer to watch the news, watch the hot news of \"a woman made 6million in this bull market\", discuss the K-line form and look for inside information.\n   Others want to start a business and start a factory, but no one wants to calm down, recharge, read a few books and learn something. The answer they often give me is: \"I don't think reading is so important. I have to use it! What I lack now is experience. I really need it. Look at my Shifu. He can't read a big word. He still travels far and wide, but he is very experienced\n   Here, people like to talk about wealth, sigh about the past, rush for gossip, and talk about celebrity events. However, no one ever wants to know the theory and causes behind these events, and no one will calm down and study them slowly with a book.\n   Since the beginning of the reform and opening up in the 1980s, China has undergone great changes, which have had a far-reaching impact on China's economy. There have been countless opportunities and tens of thousands of rich people.\n   Some people don't even know how rich they are, so they get rich. In the face of wealth, people tend to inflate extremely, overemphasize their ability, and ignore the role of objective factors.\n   Especially in this realistic society, the causes are often deduced from the results. When a person is successful, you always feel that everything he says is right. Therefore, these phenomena give people the illusion: what is the use of reading? It is true to be able to earn money and have the ability.\n   I believe you often encounter this kind of situation. When you look at a book, a person suddenly comes over, taps you on the shoulder, and says to you, \"Hey, don't read. It's better to go out to society for a few years and learn more than you read in books. You see so and so, you never read, and you still don't make a fortune. This society is looking at ability.\"\n   What is competence? God knows. Some people think it is a network, some people understand it as \"resources\", and others understand it as power.\n2. In the past, all the sudden wealth was due to asymmetric information\n   However, in my opinion, these interpretations simply do not point to the essence of the problem - all the sudden rich who did not rely on brain power and technical content in the past had a premise: because of asymmetric information.\n   What is information asymmetry? Let me give you an example. You will know that in the legend of China's stock market, you can never escape the word \"Yang million\". As the first to get rich in China's stock market, no matter how you evaluate him - speculation or bad luck, the name of Yang million has been written into the history of China's stock market and has become a legend.\n   How did this man accomplish his original accumulation? One day, he happened to read a newspaper and found a phenomenon: the prices of treasury bills in the two places were different. In this way, he bought Treasury bills from places with low prices, loaded them with snakeskin bags, and took the train to another place with high purchase prices.\n   He went back and forth many times a year, until one day, there was no price difference in treasury bills, and he completed his first primitive accumulation - the first million in his life, which was in 1989. For a factory worker, this money is undoubtedly an astronomical figure - and all this is not because he has read any books, but because he saw a magical newspaper one day, at some time, at some place, and precisely others did not notice.\n   Another example: when China just joined the WTO, its foreign trade was easy to do, and the money seemed to have been picked up. At that time, few factories were opened and the competition was incomplete. Therefore, foreigners came to China without any bargaining conditions - of course, they did not need to negotiate. At that time, the goods were simply too cheap for them to hold dollars.\n   It is common to earn 50 yuan for a pair of real leather shoes at 100 yuan. For Chinese people, 50 yuan was a lot. At that time, the salary of an ordinary worker was only one or two thousand yuan. For foreigners, these shoes are too cheap. They are made of genuine leather and only cost 100 yuan a pair.\n   Incomplete competition, in essence, is the insufficient circulation of information. Because many people do not know how to make money from foreign trade, they can only rely on word of mouth. The speed of word-of-mouth is very slow, and it is difficult to distinguish the actual from the actual. Therefore, the manufacturing bosses have enough time to complete the original capital accumulation.\n   Do these need reading? unwanted. In the era of information blockage, you don't need technology, knowledge reserve, or even capital.\n3. The Internet changes the rules of the game. Only by reading more can we see the trend\n   I remember when I was just born, my father made a lot of money in business. The reason was very simple: at that time, the reform and opening up had just begun. Scholars, farmers, industry and commerce were at the bottom of the list. Everyone felt that it was a disgrace to do business. But my father was brave enough to pull his face and push a cart out to ask for business, so he did it.\n   Yes, you only need to be brave enough to seize an opportunity, and you may become rich.\n   \"The key to life is to learn to seize opportunities. Sometimes one or two can affect your life.\" Isn't that what many of our predecessors told us? (in order to publicize his opportunism, some people even quote Beethoven's famous saying \"I will hold the throat of fate\".)\n   As for whether this opportunity fell from the sky or came from your friend's mouth, only God knows. Maybe you've waited all your life, and you can't wait for such an opportunity. Therefore, there is always the illusion that \"good things always happen to others, and I am the only unlucky one.\"\n   Now, however, things have changed for a simple reason: the Internet.\n   When the Internet was born, information began to become fully circulated. For example, when you used to buy things, there were many things you needed, but you couldn't buy them - such as mechanical keyboards. I still find that even in big cities like Guangzhou, there are still very few shops selling mechanical keyboards.\n   It's not easy for you to find a seller. When people see you full of joy, their first consciousness is to kill you.\n   Now with Taobao, it's hard for people to kill you. When you search the Internet, the price is clear. Because the online price is too transparent, it is almost the same.\n   When the information is fully circulated, opportunism will be relatively reduced - you can buy Treasury bills online, the price is transparent, there is no regional price difference, and there is no room for arbitrage. For foreign trade, the price was clear at a glance after a search on eBay. In the past, you used to have power and can be domineering. Now I take a mobile phone to shoot you online, and you are in danger of being laid off.\n   So, now we feel that money is becoming more and more difficult to earn. That's the point - you have less and less chance to make profits by taking advantage of opportunities. The information is fully circulated. What you can do is that someone else buys a sample in your online store and copies it by dividing three by five. Finally, more and more people are making the same product as you, and the price is getting lower and lower until there is no profit.\n   In an information - blocked environment, you can get rich overnight without reading. In an environment of full flow of information, without these opportunities for sudden wealth, what can you rely on?\n   It depends on real skills. If there is any opportunity, it is also an accurate judgment on the future trend.\n   I don't know what role reading can play in this industrial upgrading. I just know that without reading and knowledge, it will be easy to be eliminated in this industrial upgrading by relying only on experience, contacts, relationships, money and tossing.\n4. Reading more books will reduce a lot of unnecessary disputes and quarrels\n   The advantage of books is that, trapped in reality, it is impossible for you to get to know so many excellent people like those in books, because some people who wrote books have died, and only thoughts have survived. However, books give you a way to get close to them.\n   Our experience in real life is often one-sided and punctate. You may suddenly realize oneortwo precious truths because of oneortwo experiences. But soon, like many times before, after a day or two of excitement, you immediately forget what you should have done before.\n   The reason is that they are only scattered in your mind, and have not become a complete knowledge system to support you and form your beliefs.\n   What books give you is systematic knowledge classification and sorting. It connects all the points into one face for systematic induction. Books bring us more ways to sort out problems and ways of thinking, which can not be replaced by experience.\n   Not only that, books can also give people a supplement to experience - one cannot experience multiple lives. However, books can, you can see the history and biographies, you can see the colorful and diverse life, so as to summarize the general rules.\n   The biggest problem caused by not reading is that we blindly believe in empiricism and feel that experience is supreme. If you think about it, is there anything more precious than my own experience? Only what I have experienced is suitable for me. Everything in books is dead, but my experience is alive. Like this one:\n   In fact, his statement is a logical error, separating experience from theory and making extreme assumptions. In fact, in real life, there are no inexperienced people. As long as you live, you will have experience. If you have experience, you will have experience. Therefore, there are no people who only study but have no experience. However, there are many people who only have experience but do not study.\n   This is also a group of writers. A writer actually advocates the theory that reading is useless. I don't know how he writes things.\n   Lack of reading also leads to a series of problems:\n5. low reading ability.\n   These people even regard chicken soup as the essence of human thought. You can't remind him, for fear that he will be angry.\n6. the speech is dominated by emotion without any logic.\n7. those who rely on feeling and intuition but do not believe in science. For example, this is how our Master Wang Lin started his fire. Now some so-called energy masters are really believed. When others describe the magic of these people to me, they are really lifelike.\n8. a person who doesn't like learning is usually not very modest. So it's hard to be aware of your shortcomings, so don't expect them to correct their mistakes. They thought it was fate, but in fact, many reasons were caused by themselves.\n   If you read more books, nothing else, there will be less unnecessary disputes and quarrels in this society.\n9. Most people who preach the theory that reading is useless do not read\n   Personally, my family was not very good. Like many parents, my parents came from a barren age. They had great tastes but limited abilities. Like many of us, they teach Jianghu routines. For example, my father often said to me, \"you should learn by methods.\" He never taught me how to read. He thought that if I repeated this sentence 10000 times, I would be able to speak the method. Then there is the pressure, reward and punishment mechanism, which is called education.)\n   Many of my personality, thinking and habits benefit from books. I study methods and correct them slowly the day after tomorrow. I am not born with them.\n   From the perspective of big data, the ninth national reading survey organized by the China Press and Publication Research Institute shows that in 2011, the per capita reading in China was only 4.3, far lower than 11 in South Korea, 20 in France, 40 in Japan, not to mention 64 in Jews. China is one of the countries in the world where the average person reads the least.\n   Whether the survey data are accurate or not, we can roughly draw a conclusion: it is an indisputable fact that the reading rate in developed countries is much higher than that in China. Whether a country is developed or not is closely related to the reading rate of the whole people.\n   When I was at my classmates' party, no one ever talked to me about movies, music and books. It was always a three piece set of \"have you bought a house\", \"have you bought a car\" and \"how old are the children\". After discussing these issues, the party could almost end.\n   It is not a question of whether reading is useful at all, but of whether reading is useful.\n   Many people who hold the view that \"reading is useless\" do not read, or do not understand after reading. You don't read very much and talk about whether reading is useful. This is a very funny thing in itself.\n   In fact, many people don't even know that they don't read. They are actually reading in another way.\n   For example, a boss spent thousands of yuan to listen to a \"speech by successful people\", He came to me with joy and said: \"Hey, you know what? I heard the teacher's speech last night, and I really gained a lot. There are many new ideas in his view. For example, he said that many people in our world succeed because of persistence. One day, a friend of his, golf, began to learn from 0. His friend told the teacher that although he is a novice, he is an expert as long as he keeps swinging 1000 times. He swings 10000 times , he is the master... \"\n   Before she finished, I understood that the \"story of my friend\" told by the successful learning speaker was actually a modified version of the 10000 hour theory. The source of this theory comes from Gladwell's alien - in fact, they are not lazy, impetuous and can't stand loneliness. They prefer to sit down with a group of people and listen to others tell stories to themselves, even if it costs a little money, rather than reading line by line.\n   A person who is lazy will usually make a series of reasonable explanations for his behavior, such as \"the theory that reading is useless\".\n   Therefore, I think it would be better for these people to come back and discuss the topic of \"whether reading is useful or not\" after reading some books.", "timestamp": 1654531658, "digest": "ucbyfvBv9pjN7E0yjqSU5gzIPbWKEVW_uRJmitJo4xM", "contributor": "0xA70184cAb4b9a0aee0951ea3Bb542A6E48971885"}
{"id": "j-nBaKOggjVJip7PP0sW_WHemH2MqE2p7-__GNb-vfs", "title": "Who made them so rich? No one else, just themselves", "body": "Not all \"Inequalities\" are bad. In terms of labor income inequality, some of the factors that lead to different incomes of workers are normal or even positive. For example, diligent workers should earn more than lazy workers, and smart people earn more than stupid people. There are also reasonable factors that affect the inequality of capital income. For example, it is wise and prudent for us to increase our savings in anticipation of the possible uncertainty of income or expenditure in the future. According to Aesop's fables, ants are busy storing food for the winter in summer, but cicadas sing and play every day. In winter, they have to starve.\nThe top 10% of the income in a society often gathers the elite of the society. When we talk about income inequality, the \"10%\" are easily disgusted, because they believe that everything they do depends on personal struggle.\nBut as far as income inequality is concerned, it is not the \"10%\" who really deserve to be worried.\nThere are also strata in the stratum. Among the top 10% of income, we can distinguish \"1% and\" 9% \". \"9%\" people may feel that they have been able to eat at the same table with \"1%\" people. Only \"1%\" people know that their world is very different from that of \"9%\". From \"9% to\" 1% \", it is as difficult as a carp jumping over a dragon's gate.\nIn the \"9% of the\" 10% \", the income mainly comes from wages. Only when it reaches a higher \"1%\" or even the highest \"0.5%\", the proportion of capital income exceeds that of labor income. In the \"1%\", the higher the income, the lower the proportion of real estate in wealth and the higher the proportion of financial assets. Financial assets are mainly stocks. The income from the stock mainly comes from the dividend of the stock, rather than the income after the stock appreciation (that is, the income from stock speculation).\nAfter the 1980s, a special phenomenon, first in the United States and then in other countries, was the emergence of a group of \"star managers\" with sky high annual salaries, who accounted for \"1%\". From the 1970s to the beginning of the 21st century, the proportion of the income of the \"10%\" group with the highest income in the United States in the national income increased by 15%, of which 3/4 went to the \"1%\" group.\nWhy can these \"super managers\" take so much money?\nIf we believe that, because of the technological revolution after the 1980s, only a few star entrepreneurs can be outstanding and conform to the trend. Therefore, they deserve so much money. Then, \"super managers\" should appear worldwide. But why do we see this change only in Britain and the United States and other countries?\nObserve the proportion of the highest income \"1%\" in national income, and the \"super manager society\" mainly appears in Anglo Saxon countries. In the 1970s, the income of the \"1%\" group with the highest income in the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia accounted for 6% - 8% of the national income. By 2010, this proportion had reached 20% in the United States, 14% - 15% in Britain and Canada, and 9% - 10% in Australia. In continental European countries and Japan, the proportion of the income of the highest \"1%\" in the national income has also increased, but the trend is much more moderate. Is it true that only the United States has the Internet? Is it only in the United States that there is a need for special entrepreneurial talent?\nIf we agree that the sky high salary of \"super managers\" is due to their outstanding talents, how can we explain the huge gap between \"1% and\" 9%? \"? The annual salary is \"9%\" between 100000 and 200000 euros, and the growth rate of income level is only slightly faster than the average level, while the annual salary is \"1%\" above 500000 euros, or even 1million euros, and the income level is greatly improved. If the income is determined by ability, from \"9% to\" 1% \", the income should increase gradually. Why is there a sudden leap forward? The members of the \"9%\" and \"1%\" classes have little difference in terms of education, professional skills or work experience. Why is there such a huge difference? Even if your boss is smarter than you, can he be five or even ten times smarter than you?\nIn fact, we don't have to hide our ears. The reason why \"super managers\" get sky high annual salary is very simple: their annual salary is mostly decided by themselves. Most enterprises have compensation committees, and the members of the compensation committees are either friends of senior executives or \"1%\" as rich as them. Intentionally or unintentionally, they overestimate their abilities and demand higher compensation for senior executives. This can not just blame them for greed, but to realize that the system is flawed. Human nature can not stand the test. When executives have too much autonomy in determining their own salary, it will lead to the failure of corporate governance mechanism and the aggravation of income inequality in the whole society.", "timestamp": 1654531727, "digest": "7nxWt2RnTWAYRC-j5cQYJ6WYgGASO5H1skngLV31NTc", "contributor": "0xBeE961f762506779c6aAcaE2CB6D9E431AFbDaB2"}
{"id": "HW6aeVbEvRCZ07jPqyru0xiqt36dqm-Tm4ert0qjFQY", "title": "People trapped in poverty who get something for nothing", "body": "There is a very interesting phenomenon: for example, if you drive and knock down a pedestrian who runs a red light, the pedestrian is generally responsible for 70% of the responsibility, and you have to bear the rest of the responsibility, because the pedestrian is a vulnerable group, but if you drive and become a pedestrian, you will immediately become a so-called vulnerable group.\nThe vulnerable groups we define are not the poor living below the poverty line, but a comparison for no reason. For example, when a man in gorgeous clothes is attacked by a man in shabby clothes, an unsuspecting witness will subconsciously think that it must be the magnificent man who is making trouble out of nothing.\nYou probably never thought that this kind of thinking does not have much impact on the rich, but makes some vulnerable groups more honest and powerful.\nTo tell a true story, there was a pair of twins in our class when we were studying. My sister always worked hard. She not only got excellent grades, but also was versatile and envious of others; Mei Mei is mediocre. Everything is just as it is. She doesn't fight or rob. Her personality is also pleasing.\nAfter graduating from college, my sister was lucky to find a decent job in the provincial capital, and my sister returned to small cities to work as a salesperson. A year or two after graduation, the relationship between the two sisters was as close as before. My sister often brought her a lot of beautiful clothes and some new things from the provincial capital.\nLater, the two sisters got married and had children one after another. The excellent sister naturally found a good marriage, but the younger sister was infatuated with the local bastard. The bastard would cajole people. The younger sister fell completely in his sweet words and boos. Of course, this love was not blessed by her parents. Despite the strong dissuasion of her parents and sister, the younger sister still married him unswervingly.\nA few years later, my sister and her husband both got promoted and raised wages with their own efforts. My sister had a very bad life. Her weak character could not keep a prodigal son's heart. The Hun son looked for a new lover and left her and a lovely daughter. The connection between them has been unknowingly estranged. Speaking of it, they are all high sounding reasons: they have their own lives, but in fact, everyone knows that they are no longer people in the same world. Although my sister tries her best to make up for this relationship, my sister is always ungrateful.\nOn the first day of the lunar new year this year, when people in small cities were cheering to welcome the new year, the two sisters were red in ears. The reason is very simple: on the first day of the previous year, both sisters would make an appointment to pay New Year's greetings to their parents early in the morning. But this year, my sister went to pay New Year's greetings to the leaders of the same city. It was already noon when she returned to her mother's house. This is a trivial matter, but my sister is not willing to let go. She scolds her sister for becoming more and more powerful and likes to follow the trend. Of course, my sister is very wronged. My sister will never understand her hardships. Did she just work hard for her little family? She gets a meager salary in the annual subsidies. Even her sister, who needs her help to support her daughter, bears all the medical expenses if her parents are ill. There are too many hardships that her sister doesn't understand in terms of promotion and salary increase and the difficulty of living.\nLater, my sister took my sister to live in the provincial capital regardless of past grievances. With her accumulated contacts over the years, she found a job for my sister, and the salary was enough to support her and her children. A month later, my sister quit her job. She kept complaining to her sister that the job was too hard, but she didn't know that her sister often worked overtime all night at the beginning of her work.\nMy sister reluctantly asked someone to find another job for her sister. The working time of this job was not long. Of course, the income would not be high. Sure enough, it wasn't long before my sister resigned again because of the low salary.\nAfter several times, my sister's husband naturally expressed his dissatisfaction, My brother-in-law taught my sister: \"there has never been such a thing as getting something for nothing in the world. Now you have to support yourself and your children. You have had an unfortunate marriage. Do you want to ruin your life? You are only in your thirties. As long as you work hard enough, this society will never starve to death! But the most terrible thing is that you are poor. Of course, no one can help you...\"\nHer brother-in-law painstakingly taught her that she would make progress, but she unexpectedly rebutted them and left them speechless, Mei Mei complained: \"What about money? Is money like my sister's? You can't buy a few clothes a year, and you wear them all in old clothes. You look down on me, and I look down on you. You don't know how to enjoy life! You are rich, so why don't you support me and my daughter? The jobs you introduced to me are either hard or can't make money. Don't you just dislike my poverty? It's not so much that you want to help me that you're afraid of me losing face and that I'll become you They are impatient to sell me out! \"\nWith that, Mei Mei burst out of the door, leaving her stunned sister and brother-in-law behind.\nMei Mei's words just completely show the ideas of some poor people living in this society.\nIt is strange that they have been seeking equality. They have obtained equal job opportunities with others, and their children have successfully entered a good school. Of course, the equality they seek will always fall on the rights. If their responsibilities are investigated, they are not willing to pay for these rights. When asked why, they would answer: do I have to be inferior because I am poor?\nDo you know what is inferior? What is inferior is not the social status, money or honor you see. What you see is just the definition given by the outside world. There is no right or wrong, only right and wrong. And what is equality? Equality is spiritual independence, but this independence depends on material wealth. You don't have to confuse the concept of laziness that you want to escape responsibility as \"inequality\".\nSince childhood, you have the right to education. You don't want to study at night like others. Later, when you look at people who have a good job with their high education, you will pretend that they are the second generation of officials or the second generation of rich people. You never review that you are not practical, hardworking and progressive. You will only complain and fantasize.\nLike my sister, some people who are not rich are willing to criticize the rich for not enjoying life. Not to mention whether this sentence is self comforting, let's talk about the word \"willing\". As far as most elites in the society are concerned, their success is inseparable from hard work except opportunities. The accumulation of wealth is not as easy as you can imagine. Without the life experience of accumulating wealth from morning to night, climbing and rolling, they will not understand the \"not willing\" in the eyes of the middle class.\nWhat is sister's so-called willingness? Even if you don't have enough to eat, you have to buy new clothes to decorate your soulless body. And where is the \"willing\" of the middle class? It is used to improve the quality of life and cultivate a better next generation. So can you understand the difference between \"willing\" and \"investment\"?\nI have many middle-class friends around me. Once they succeed, they will take on the responsibility of supporting the whole family. Such responsibility can not be shirked. Once they refuse, they will be blamed as \"ungrateful and ignorant. All their achievements are mostly the result of their own efforts, and have nothing to do with others. While the\" receiving and eating \"people are extremely magnanimous and calm, as if all these are natural and natural demands - because you are richer than me, you are also responsible for supporting me.\nMy sister may have never thought about why she doesn't know how to be grateful and doesn't want to make progress. But in fact, it is precisely because of her sister's \"kindness\" that her sister has lost a certain ability to strive. If all the things come easily, no one will want to cherish them. Once you take away these things one day, he will feel naked \"abandoned\".\nI never agree with the saying that people are divided into three or six or nine grades, and I never like to use one kind of people to include a group of people. This statement is somewhat one-sided. Although there is not gold everywhere, as long as you spare no pains, you will not be so poor that you need help from others to survive.\nI advocate equality in any form, especially in the spiritual level. It doesn't matter whether you are a famous brand, but whether you have a noble soul. People who are trapped in poverty and get something for nothing. As long as you are willing to go out, you never need to bow down to anyone. All your gains are accumulated bit by bit, and you deserve respect no matter how much or how little; People who have struggled for so many years to live today, please don't abuse your compassion, and don't condescend to give alms to anyone. You must not give them a lifetime of peace, so please don't ruin their lives and give them a false impression that they can get it even if they don't work.?

{"id": "N-5GTivu_fCNj_k6R9MuOoXDaeJ89RvNWozAM_09YdE", "title": "Why are you so bad at execution?", "body": "When many people just enter the workplace, they are still full of confidence and firm will. Once they encounter setbacks and fail to make progress and growth in their work, they will suffer a great blow and lose their self-confidence and self-improvement. Even if you are not frustrated, if the job is not suitable for you, it will also lead to job burnout in the long run. Once you are tired physically and mentally, it is even more difficult to act.\nLet's take a look at the three main reasons for your poor execution:\n\n1. Wrong career orientation, loss of self-confidence and self-improvement\n   There will be difficulties in many jobs. What needs to be emphasized here is that what leads to the loss of your self-confidence and self-improvement is \"repeated frustration\". Proper frustration will make a person grow up; And repeated setbacks will make an originally motivated person become negative and pessimistic, thus losing his enthusiasm for work and life.\n   So, under what circumstances will it be \"repeatedly frustrated\"? There is only one answer, that is: when the career planning orientation is wrong and you choose a career that is not suitable for you! This is the reason why most people are \"repeatedly frustrated\" at the root! For example, a person who is naturally suitable for sales will certainly encounter difficulties when engaging in sales, but these difficulties are not big problems for him and can be solved completely; But if you are a natural unfit for sales, you will encounter many more difficulties and have more difficulties to solve when you are also engaged in sales. If you often suffer such setbacks, it is easy for you to doubt the prospect of this job, which will lead to the loss of self-confidence and self-improvement. In this case, you will often doubt yourself. If you have this suspicion for a long time, then you have completely conceded defeat. This is another function of psychological suggestion.\n   Therefore, if you want to improve your executive ability, you must make sure that the career you choose at the beginning is correct, suitable for you, and can stimulate your interest and give full play to your advantages. In this way, you will become more confident; Otherwise, instead, there will be a steady stream of failures.\n2. Miss development opportunities and be timid\n   Case: \"Teacher, I have been working for 12 years. I am 35 years old this year. I bought a house with a loan three years ago, and now my child has just been born. My parents are old, weak and sick. Now I am under great pressure to take care of my wife, repay the mortgage, and take care of my parents... Although I have been working for more than ten years, I have skipped job hopping for sevenoreight times, but I have not made much progress. So far, I am still an ordinary grass-roots employee without a sense of achievement. Instead, I I feel very tired. Recently, a friend started his own business and wanted to invite me to do it together, but his wife felt that there was a risk. Once he failed, his current job would be lost, and the life of his family would become a problem again. When I was young, I also had a lot of ideas and wanted to make a career, but the reality was too cruel to let go of many things. Teacher, what should I do? \"\n   During the consultation process, we also met many people with ideas, but because of various practical difficulties in front of us, they have never had the courage to take the first step. There are not a few such cases.\n   For students, career planning before junior year is the best time; If you unfortunately enter the workplace with confusion, you must know where your career goals are in the first three years of work. The Chinese speak of \"standing at 30\", which is a very important age. Before you reach this age, you should consider at least three years in advance: what is your capital to \"stand up\"? These capital should be completed before the age of 30. Maybe you will refute me, saying that XXX still starts a business when he is 60. Here we need to consider a probability problem. If you feel confident that you will succeed again at the age of 60, there is no problem at all; But for most people, if they don't succeed at the age of 30, the chances of success at the age of 60 are very slim. In contrast, it is easier to succeed when you are young. In that case, why do you have to wait until you are 60 to work hard?\n   Many people are very short-sighted and snobbish. They can't see the long-term. As a result, after a few years, problems have arisen. At this time, try to find a way to solve it. It's very likely that you are already unable to do what you want.\n   If you regret it now, your previous choice must have been wrong; If you don't want to regret it again in the future, then from now on, don't go wrong again.\n   Don't wait until something goes wrong. Do your best at the beginning.\n3. Mental laziness\n   Many people begin to retreat at the thought of having so many things to do before they take action. As mentioned above, everyone knows the truth, but what they worry about is: how many can they really do? Some people try to do it, but they can't stick to it when they encounter a little difficulty;\n   What's more, some people don't try at all!\n   Remember: never set limits for yourself! The reason why you find it difficult is that you have set limits for yourself, thus binding your hands and feet. In fact, there are not so many difficulties. It's all your own imagination. Some difficulties seem terrible. In fact, once you do them, you will find that they are not as difficult as you think. The reason why you feel difficult is that you underestimate yourself and overestimate the difficulties. If the opposite is true, the results will be quite different. In the face of courage, all difficulties are paper tigers.\n   It suddenly occurred to me that there was an article in the middle school textbook called \"for learning\". There was a sentence in it. Now it is really the truth of life. The article says, \"is there any difficulty in the world? If you do it, it will be easy for those who are difficult; if you don't do it, it will be difficult for those who are easy!\" There is no difficulty or ease in everything in the world. The only difference is, do you have the courage to face it?\n   There is no pie in the sky. Behind success, there must be hard work. For those who are mentally lazy, we need to remember Li Ao's words again: there is only one reason to move forward, but there are a hundred reasons to retreat. Many people find a hundred reasons to prove that they are not cowards, but they never use one reason to prove that they are warriors!", "timestamp": 1654531956, "digest": "avsoYzGkyCPvg7WBjwvynbIzg7EH0tdNeU7rMZhh49w", "contributor": "0x7BB57447312fe2A1f5c9A299C1627DB252af00D8"}

{"id": "2p7zbhmjc6MrFB7gFP2aoELwNEjuPgVDEs0xJ_DtBro", "title": "Disaggregating the Blockchain Stack", "body": "Today’s cryptoverse is multi-chain and rollup-rich. But this wasn't always the case. Not long ago, Ethereum was without scaling solutions and faced headwinds as new dapps constrained blockspace to the point where a simple transaction required $200 in gas fees. This priced out retail investors, baptized skeptics, and armed Web3 critics, who joyfully celebrated the death of crypto.\n\nAs all eyes were on Ethereum, the community dug in and re-centered its focus to address the rising gas fees. This pivot led to Ethereum adopting a rollup-centric roadmap, setting the stage for innovate products like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Zksync.\n\nThis pivot is today’s story, and in this article I explore how Ethereum has, and will continue, to transition from a monolithic chain to Web3’s preferred settlement layer.\n\nMore specifically, I will cover:\n\n* What makes a blockchain \"monolithic\"\n* Why monolithic blockchains struggle to scale\n* How rollups solve some of these challenges\n* Why rollups represent the first step to a more modular blockchain design space\n* Tradeoffs and risks to disaggregating blockchain components\n\n## A Primer on Monolithic Blockchains\n\nMonolithic blockchains do it all. They execute transactions. They facilitate consensus. They make transaction data available to stakeholders. And they can also settle (i.e., validate and arbitrate) transactions for other blockchains.\n\nLet's define these four components in the context of Ethereum:\n\n### Execution\n\nWhen a miner wants to create a block, it pulls transactions out of a pool, validates each transaction, orders them into a block, and computes the block's state root. The state root is a single output, resembling a snapshot that reflects all the account balances after applying the block's transactions. Here, a miner is executing each transaction to transition the blockchain’s state form A to B (e.g., Alice sends Bob 2 Eth. Old state: Alice 5 ETH, Bob 10 ETH; New State: Alice 3 ETH, Bob 12 ETH).\n\n### Consensus\n\nReaching consensus means nodes agree on the order in which transactions are processed. When a new block (a) is proposed, nodes can reach consensus by explicitly or implicitly attesting to the block. To explicitly attest, nodes submit votes, just like you would in a presidential election. To implicitly attest, nodes choose to build on top of the proposed block, contributing to the longest chain (i.e., Nakamoto Consensus). Ethereum currently follows the Nakamoto Consensus design but plans to transition to a an explicit voting implementation with its shift to proof of stake.\n\nRegardless of the approach, monolithic blockchains must be able to facilitate consensus to ensure everyone agrees on the state of the chain.\n\n### Data Availability\n\nWhen a miner propagates a block, they must include all the transactions required for validators to recreate the miner's proposed state root. If this data is withheld, other nodes have no way of bridging pre-state to post-state. Moreover, applications, developers, and other stakeholders (that aren't running a full node) are unable to track on-chain activity.\n\nMaking this data available is critical to preserve transparency and security, especially in a future where light clients (who can only see block headers) significantly outnumber full nodes.\n\n### Settlement\n\nA settlement refers to a payment that is final and delivered. With cryptocurrencies, a transaction is settled after it is stored and confirmed on a blockchain. Layer 2 blockchains (e.g., rollups) can use select Layer 1 blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) as their dedicated place of settlement. Ethereum frequently settles transactions for other chains because it offers battle tested security and finality.\n\n[“You can think of a settlement layer like the US Supreme Court (in its ideal state): incorruptible, always available, resilient, and called upon only to serve as final arbitrator.\"](https://consensys.net/research/the-maximally-decentralized-settlement-layer/)\n\n### Pulling it all Together\n\nMonolithic blockchains transition state (execution), facilitate consensus on these state transitions (consensus), ensure stakeholders can see the inputs driving these transitions (data availability), and can settle state transitions for other protocols.\n\nBut it turns out, the monolithic design is cripplingly inefficient. It is bound by the scalability trilemma, which dictates that higher throughput [necessarily means lower security and/or decentralization](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html).\n\n![The scalability trilemma says that there are three properties that a blockchain tries to have, and that, if you stick to \"simple\" techniques, you can only get two of those three. Source: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k7w5Mu5RKgZ3PoOKJnEhc.png?height=553&width=733)\n\n## Why Monolithic Blockchains Struggle to Scale\n\nIn 2017, when Ethereum’s fees started to escape normal bands, many claimed that the community should increase the target block size. To many, this seemed like a reasonable suggestion. After all, if fees are increasing because block space is limited, why not just add more block space? But this introduces a serious side effect.\n\nBy increasing the target block size, nodes must validate and process a longer list of transactions in the same amount of time. As a result, larger blocks require more performant hardware. Hardware, that for some, could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nPut another way, increasing the target block size reduces the amount of people who can afford to run a full node, centralizing the protocol. A more centralized protocol means a less secure network. And at the end of the day, a protocol's value rests on its security and incorruptibility. Even one small exploit is enough to undermine confidence in the protocol and lead to a mass exodus of users.\n\nSo, how do you scale a monolithic blockchain without significantly increasing its target block size?\n\n## Rollups\n\nEthereum requires every node to re-execute every transaction, and this is primarily why it struggles to scale. But what if there was a way to outsource this process to reduce the execution burden on validators?\n\nThis is effectively how a rollup works. A rollup is an off-chain execution layer (essentially a separate EVM compatible blockchain), where a handful of nodes process and send transaction batches down to Ethereum in a highly compressed format. Instead of piling many individual transactions into a block, rollups submit one batch, which holds many tightly compressed micro-transactions (i.e., messages holding just the data needed to bridge the pre- to post state root).\n\n![Basic Rollup workflow. Source: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dI1BqW5qs6ix9giKKxFj7.png?height=775&width=1906)\n\nThe compression off-chain eliminates the need for Ethereum’s \\~11k validators (at Ethereum’s peak) to re-execute these transactions, freeing up precious blockspace and reducing fees for rollup users. And this reduction is meaningful; [a simple ERC20 token transfer costs \\~45000 gas, while an ERC20 token transfer in a rollup costs under 300 gas](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html).\n\nMoreover, by publishing data back to Ethereum, [anyone can locally process all the operations in the rollup, allowing them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or personally start producing transaction batches as a sequencer.](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)\n\nRollups are an elegant solution to the trilemma as they extend Ethereuem’s security profile to new, cheaper, and EVM compatible execution environments. This has led Ethereum’s founders to claim that, [rollups are in the short and medium term, and possibly the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n\nRollups leverage Ethereum's best attributes (security) while managing its weakness (execution). In this way, rollups have illustrated how we can modularize blockchain components to optimize outcomes. Not everything needs to be managed by the same set of nodes. And, in fact, we can continue to unbundle the stack to drive further improvements.\n\n## The Great Unbundling\n\nWhile rollups are a major unlock, they are still limited by their L1's block parameters. Rollups are sending batches back down to the L1 in the form of calldata. When rollups send calldata to an L1, it usually resembles an empty transaction (i.e., no value is exchanged) that encloses data about the transactions processed on the L2 network (i.e., \"the micro-transactions\" referenced earlier).\n\nBecause these batches are processed on an L1, they are subject to gas wars and mainnet congestion. And these gas costs can be significant, in some cases representing over 90% of a rollup’s costs. [Just recently, a major NFT auction (Yuga Labs' Otherside Land Sale) catalyzed so much traffic that even a simple DEX swap on Optimism ran \\~$130.](https://public-grafana.optimism.io/d/9hkhMxn7z/public-dashboard?orgId=1&refresh=5m&from=now-90d&to=now)\n\n### What drives a rollup’s gas costs?\n\n[Adeets_22](https://forum.celestia.org/u/adeets_22), broke down the component parts of a Zk L2 → L1 batch in the below analysis. It illustrates how calldata costs shackle rollup users to Ethereum’s costly gas fees.\n\n![Source: https://forum.celestia.org/t/ethereum-rollup-call-data-pricing-analysis/141](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/odV6YCAePpi7gsptmQXot.png?height=1042&width=1075)\n\nThe key takeaway from this analysis is that the majority of gas spent in a state update event will be spent on making data available on the L1 and not on the verification of the ZK proof itself.\n\n### Reducing costs with Validiums and Volitions\n\nNow imagine if a ZK rollup didn't need to make transaction data available on the L1. Imagine if, instead, it only needed to publish the bare minimum (i.e., a proof and state transition) to the L1, while sending everything else (i.e., the details of each transaction) to a separate, cheaper environment. While rollups decouple execution from the L1, this new model goes one step further and decouples data availability from the L1. [The payment for on-chain data is not required in this model. A state update event only costs the gas needed for verifying the proof.](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4/starkex-deep-dive/data-availability-modes)\n\nThis model has been coined a \"Validium.\"\n\n![Source: https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CD0N9-TnFL_f5N9oOWz-9.png?height=388&width=1038)\n\n\"Volitions\" take this concept even further by letting users easily switch between a rollup and a validium. Some applications, such as decentralized derivatives exchanges, might prefer a validium (because keeping data off-chain preserves the privacy of trades), while others, still wanting to interoperate with applications, might prefer a rollup. Volitions allow users and applications to oscillate between solutions depending on their data availability preferences.\n\n![Source: https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jA00-2BMN1LuU4zPnmGet.png?height=384&width=1038)\n\n## Challenges with Modularization\n\nUnbundling blockchain components provides better scaling and cheaper fees without significantly compromising trust assumptions. But there are still assumptions! Each time a component is outsourced, unsurprisingly, new risks appear and compound.\n\nArbitrum, for example, does not currently have a fully decentralized sequencer. [While proposing batches is open to anyone, the system employs a privileged sequencer that has priority for submitting transaction batches and ordering transactions.](https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/)\n\n[Moreover, StarkEx, a relatively new validium, doesn't have a fully decentralized DA solution (they use more of a PoA model with an eight-person committee).](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n\nTo hammer the point home -- disaggregating monolithic blockchains can unlock significant scalability, but it also introduces new environments with socioeconomic and technological trust assumptions that require special consideration. If you’re interested in exploring these considerations, L2beat does a great job of outlining tradeoffs/risks across the rollup landscape.\n\n[https://l2beat.com/?view=risk](https://l2beat.com/?view=risk)\n\n### Appendix - EIP 4488: Decreasing Rollup Overhead\n\nValidiums and Volitions offer novel ways to manage the data availability problem without changing the core Ethereum protocol. But the Ethereum community is also tackling this problem from a different angle. EIP 4488 was proposed to [decrease transaction calldata gas cost and add a limit to how much total transaction calldata can be in a block.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n\nIf implemented, this would reduce the cost of L2 → L1 batches, thus reducing the cost of rollup-native transactions. It would also represent a small, but important, step for Ethereum on its path to become Web3’s settlement and data availability layer.\n\nFor more information on this proposal checkout proto.eth’s thread below!\n\n[https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1466114608033411072](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1466114608033411072)\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please follow me on Twitter at @jtseig.\n\nSources:\n\n* <https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html>\n* <https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html>\n* [https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec)\n* <https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/an-introduction-to-optimisms-optimistic-rollup-8450f22629e8>\n* <https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d>\n* https:[//starkware.co/starkex/](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n* https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/\n* https://blog.celestia.org/ethereum-off-chain-data-availability-landscape/", "timestamp": 1654532835, "digest": "bdO358db_-cjYJXtedrF1gNsc_bazR0lna9KchE_mZc", "contributor": "0xf15c734681f9B950e6559aB5Fe200FCe80539A80"}

Why do people rush around the world\n   A philosopher said: \"people must be fully aware of the unreasonable existence of individuals in this meaningless world in order to get rid of it.\"\n   I can often deeply feel the meaninglessness and irrationality of life. People struggle, pursue and practice all the way from coming into the world, and then leave. What is the meaning of life? This problem can not be solved. There is no answer, or the answer to this problem has been given, but no one is willing to accept it. The answer is: meaningless. It is an insoluble contradiction to know the answer and force yourself to live.\n   Jung and Heidegger have different views on the meaning of life. Jung believes that for normal people, what is the need to pursue the value of life or the meaning of existence? Such problems only happen to schizophrenic and alienated people. However, Heidegger thinks that we should ask the meaning of existence itself: \"man is a being who understands existence\".\n   Nihilism has been a great attraction to me since I was very young. This attraction is so great that I am frightened that I dare not think about these problems easily. I dare not look at the stars for a long time. Looking at it, I will think that the earth is one of the many stars; And people walk around the earth like little ants crawling around. People's joys and sorrows, joys and sorrows are of no value.\n   Everything that people strive for is actually meaningless, or more precisely: it will eventually become meaningless - eating means something to the hungry, sleeping means something to the sleepy, but it means nothing to the dead. Everyone will eventually die. Death is meaningless, so life is meaningless.\n   Why do people rush around the world? Sometimes I think (as if looking down at the earth from the sky): what are people doing in this world? I seem to see that on this small earth, the sea of people is fierce, the sun and the moon are in a hurry, and I don't know what people are pursuing.\n2. Your struggle is just a joke\n   The pain and struggle of one's life is just a joke in the context of the universe.\n   For a period of time, my mood fluctuated periodically, and there was a crisis of \"survival significance\" almost every month. When you are in a low mood, you will feel hopeless. How can one always be in high spirits? A man who is always in high spirits must be a fool, because he never thought that everything he does for him is meaningless.\n   Proust said in recalling the passing years:\n   \"I just feel that in my life, the gains and losses of honor and disgrace are as light as water, and it doesn't matter if I am robbed. The so-called short life is just an illusion.\"\n   Similarly,\n   Maugham said in the shackles of human nature in the tone of Philip:\n   \"Life has no meaning, and people live for no purpose. It doesn't matter whether a person is born or dead. Life is like dust, and death is in vain.\"\n   \"Everything is like a passing cloud, which will pass away. What traces have they left? Everything in the world, including mankind itself, is like a drop of water in a river. They are closely linked to form an unknown current, which flows to the sea.\"\n   He also wrote:\n   \"I have long found that when I am most serious, people always laugh. In fact, when I reread the paragraphs I wrote with all my feelings for a while, I want to laugh at myself. This must be because sincere feelings have something absurd in themselves.\n   But why? I can't think of a reason. Is it because people are just short lives on an insignificant planet? Therefore, for the eternal mind, the pain and struggle of a person's life is just a joke. \"\n   The above words can always move my heart: \"short life on an insignificant planet\", \"a joke\".\n   If people do not pay attention to this cruel fact, they will certainly not live soberly enough. In the view of \"eternal mind\", life is a absurd play of \"those who are in the game\". However, \"onlookers see the light\". People are deeply involved in playing the roles of joys and sorrows on stage. They are tragic and fierce. They don't want to believe it. In the view of the \"eternal mind\", it is just a joke, and they will never believe it. This is the folly of man. Everyone who doesn't want to face up to this is deceiving himself and others.\n3. Although life itself is meaningless, some things are meaningful to life\n   People want to leave traces in their lives. Some people say that the greatest goal of man is to remain famous in history; Some people say that even if it can't be remembered forever, it's good to be infamous forever. The person who said this did not expect that no trace would be left after the earth's thermal silence. I remember when I published my first article, I wrote in my diary: I have left my first trace. At that time, I didn't think that this trace was like a footprint on the beach, which would soon be smoothed by the waves. There is no doubt that no one in the world can leave a trace in the universe.\n   Hundreds of millions of years later, no one will remember who Marx was, let alone others. As the philosopher said, \"what is the purpose of life? In my opinion, it is not difficult to answer. The purpose of life is just death, because everything in this world is blown away by the breath of time like dust... Just like the footprints in the desert will be blown away at once, time will erase the traces of our existence, as if our feet had never set foot on the earth.\"\n   In that case, isn't there no difference between living and dying? That's true. This is my final view of life. When you accept this painful fact as something you have to accept, you will really calm down and your heart will really calm down. You will look at life with a overlooking and playful attitude.\n   After thinking through the meaninglessness of life, it is necessary to \"make a dead horse a living horse doctor\". Although we know that life is meaningless in the end, and although we know that people will not leave any traces after death, we can still enjoy the happiness of survival during the decades we have lived in the world. Although life itself is meaningless, some things are meaningful to life: physical and mental pain has a negative meaning to life; And the happiness of body and spirit has positive meaning to life. This is the position of comfort and happiness in my mind.\n4. How short life is, I want freedom and beauty to fill it\n   There was a time when I began to read Zen, and I had a great resonance in my heart. Zen reveals the aimlessness and meaninglessness of life; It refers to the pursuit of living life, the feeling of life. In fact, the meaning of life lies only in itself, and has nothing to do with everything else and people. When I was meditating, I thought that in the past, I was often tempted by the vanity and vanity in the world. In fact, I didn't understand.\n   However, I don't want to numb the feeling of life after penetrating. Instead, we should follow the principle of happiness to make life comfortable (no pain, basic physiological needs are met) and full (spiritual and physical enjoyment). It includes the enjoyment of good music, art, drama and literature. What is more important is to turn your life into a work of art, and let your life live in happiness. There is no need to pursue and care about anything else. A good life should be the goal of survival, and it is the most worthy pursuit.\n   Foucault said:\n   \"I am shocked by the fact that in our society, art has become just an object, not something related to individuals or life. Art has become a profession, and they are made by experts such as artists. But can't everyone's life become a work of art? Why can a lamp or a house become a work of art, but our life can't become a work of art?\"\n   Maugham also said:\n   \"I think that the world we live in should not be regarded as disgusting. The only thing that enables us to do this is beauty, which is created by people from chaos. For example, the paintings people create, the music they compose, the works they write and the life they live. Of all these, the most inspiring is the beautiful life, which is a masterpiece of art.\"\n   Life itself is meaningless, but some things are meaningful to life. How short life is. I want freedom and beauty to fill it.", "timestamp": 1654532712, "digest": "boKE1_IMiRL_i7cTjx9zNw4fF2MUKkTKGH3EvEURBnc", "contributor": "0x8A401F5711a17b2eeBA9bE2f6c9eda4B7B9DC671"}

This is a great irony to those who can explain the truth clearly but can't do it by themselves.\nI have a friend who is called the \"king of truth\" in the Jianghu. He is comparable to the invincible in quoting classics and preaching. He can analyze everything from ancient Egyptian civilization to bitcoin, and he can also talk about entertainment gossip and marriage life. In addition, his good appearance makes everyone who chats with him feel like a spring breeze, and the girls wish they could do it by themselves.\nAt that time, I drifted in Beijing with him and lived in a small house of more than ten square meters in Zhongguancun, one of the most prosperous areas in Beijing. Although the house was small, the monthly rent was not low.\nOne afternoon, I sat with him by the window. Holding a cigarette between his two fingers in his right hand, he took a deep breath and slowly spit out a big smoke ring, \"Ellie, I recently read a book about financial management. You said that the money in the bank is depreciating every day. To succeed, you need to stay in Beijing and look like a person. By being a small employee in the company, even if you get a raise every year and a promotion every five years, you have no future in your life. If you want to be outstanding, you must not go the ordinary way! Let's pool some money to invest in precious metals...\"\nLater, because of his work, he moved away. But every once in a while, he would call me to tell me that he had changed his job, entered a new industry, or found a way to make big money in a short time. However, no matter in the new industry or in the new investment method, he finally insisted on it, and he also became a long-term user of regret medicine. As a friend, I also tried to remind him: \"apart from the truth and analysis, are practical and effective methods and actions more important?\" He was stunned for a while and continued to say with confidence: \"look, the stock I said last time has really risen. If I had bought it at that time, I would have a suite now.\" The fact is that so far, he has changed his job for four times, with a monthly salary increase of 1050 yuan. His position has been promoted from a small clerk to the leader of a small project with five people. Maybe one day he will be hit by good luck. At that time, I will be absolutely brazen to say \"no forgetting, no forgetting\".\nIn this world, there are people who love to reason, and even more people who love to listen to reason. There are always many followers who get the reason they want, need or feel they have to through various channels.\nHowever, are these principles really so useful? After listening to the English learning lecture, I immediately vowed to win GRE and TOEFL for half a year, and get an offer from a famous American school one year, but the number of people who get scholarships every year will always be in the minority; After listening to the speeches of well-known entrepreneurs, I was excited even when I saw an inspirational golden sentence. I began to fantasize that I could become a CEO even if I worked hard, married Bai Fumei, and reached the peak of my life; After reading the microblog shared by emotional experts, I decided to be a woman who \"never forgets my original heart, and the years are quiet\" and waited for Gao Fu Shuai to drive colorful auspicious clouds to save himself\nJust by reading truth, you try to understand life in vain, which means that most people can't realize their illusions. Even, you should understand that some people who become famous and have a family will pull out the ladder after they go upstairs, and then tell you who want to climb up: I came up through my efforts, and you can.\nOne year later, you still can't study abroad, and even your graduation grades are not excellent. During the job interview, I found that there were too many competitors with CET-4 or CET-6 certificates, computer certificates and student cadres. The prince charming you imagined appeared at the feast of heaven and sea, or was surrounded by girls you thought were \"green tea bitches\". Resign blindly. After a walk away journey, you have to start from the bottom, and your former colleagues have been promoted to be your boss.\nHow many people give their character to the constellation, their efforts to the chicken soup, and their exams to the koi, and then say to themselves, \"I've heard a lot of truth, but I still can't live a good life.\".\nYoung people always want to talk to the world, but the world doesn't want to talk to you. Even if your skill points are full, and your health and magic values are full, you still can't resist the deep ruthlessness of the world. It is easy for young people to doubt themselves, then doubt life, and then embark on that mediocre road. But life is wonderful because there are always miracles. The key is to master the key to miracles - the right way.\nWhen I was in middle school, my father told me, \"it's better to understand a method than to understand a hundred principles; it's better to move a hundred times than to take one action.\" So far, my little success is largely due to the understanding of this sentence.\nAlmost everyone is afraid of public speaking. Like many people, I have been eager to express myself well and freely in front of people since I was young, but no matter how I try, it seems that I can't achieve my expectations. I am also a very nervous person, with some cowardice in my character. Later, when I became a teacher in New Oriental, I had to face hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands of students. In order to practice my killer skills as a teacher, I have read almost all the books that can be found to explain the ways and skills of speech. For a while, I even became a god man who could not speak well but could teach others to speak well.\nOne day, when I was making another mock speech in an empty classroom, a colleague came in, looked at it for a while and said, \"are you aware of your problems? If not, it's useless to say it 10000 times.\"\nAt his suggestion, I adopted the method of \"deliberate practice\". \"Deliberate practice\" is a set of practice methods proposed by k.andersericsson, a psychologist at the University of Florida. The secret of the method lies in repetition and feedback.\nFirst, the practitioner needs to establish an understanding and familiarity with the correct method. Speaking of speech, we must really understand what is a good speech, and to achieve this, it is not enough to rely on abstract books. Therefore, I found almost all famous speech videos to watch and figure out the subtleties. I will also go to the scene to listen to some famous people's speeches and feel the atmosphere of cheering and thundering applause.\nNext, I did a practice feedback practice cycle. Deliberate practice is an error centered practice. The practitioner must establish extreme sensitivity to errors. Once he finds himself wrong, he will feel very uncomfortable and practice until he corrects it.\nNo matter in practice or in class, I began to record videos of my speeches. Go home and watch these videos over and over again. At the beginning, you will not get used to seeing yourself in the video, and you will find that many places that you thought you were doing well before are not. Like most people who have not received professional training in broadcasting and physique, when it comes to excitement, I will wave my arms so hard that I can't see my face on the camera. I can only see one hand waving around and my body shaking with no strength; I often repeat phrases like \"that is to say, that is to say\". In English, it is \"so... So... That... That...\"; For familiar content, I will habitually speak very fast without a strong sense of rhythm. The most important thing is that there is no sense of camera, and I can't make the audience feel that I am watching them and caring about their feedback.\nI will record these problems that need to be improved in my notebook, continue to correct them, and compare them with the next public speech video. I will not cross out a problem from my notebook until it does not appear at all.\nAfter countless times of \"deliberate practice\", I was not only familiar with New Oriental's class speeches, but also became a lecturer and stood at the scene of New Oriental's \"dream journey\" series speeches with thousands of audiences.\nGladwell, the author of the best-selling book \"otherness\", said: \"the reason why people see genius as extraordinary is not that they have superior talent, but that they have made continuous efforts. After 10000 hours of training, anyone can change from ordinary to extraordinary.\" Naturally, I am not a genius. As for the progress I have made through a lot of hard work, my feeling is that there is no unique secret to success in the world. When you learn to do the simplest things to the extreme, success will naturally be close to you.\nAlong the way, although I have a prejudice against listening to \"so many truths\", it does not mean that I do not learn, understand or care about it. But I understand that no matter how much truth I hear, it is also the experience of others. Only through the transformation of methods can it become my own thing. It was always the seemingly insignificant and hard-working me who led me forward.\nSometimes, the more you understand the truth, the more constraints you will have on yourself. There are often contradictions between different principles and different suggestions. If you eat too much soul chicken soup, the taste is also different: some are salty, some are sweet, and some are spicy. If you eat too much, your stomach will go bad, your steps will be slow, and your mind will be confused. Sometimes, put chicken soup and truth aside, take a step first, and then constantly summarize and revise in practice. Only in this way can we not become the people who know a lot, but do not know much. In the end, there is almost no change and nothing can be achieved.\nThis book is also reasonable, but more methodical. I hope that every chapter in the book can help you take a solid small step. In this way, step by step, you can go farther and closer to your dream.", "timestamp": 1654532407, "digest": "lCleYdqriJ7WidxAWoBh6xagr7H6D41m8PjYyCnDwR4", "contributor": "0x9B89764F315dA31A74103f61889BCc485B51c85E"}

{"id": "f2VxfVHRVz7nLW7dx2u-FIRIg0KyLFJdihJcTCay6uI", "title": "Disaggregating the Blockchain Stack", "body": "Today’s cryptoverse is multi-chain and rollup-rich. But this wasn't always the case. Not long ago, Ethereum was without scaling solutions and faced headwinds as new dapps constrained blockspace to the point where a simple transaction required $200 in gas fees. This priced out retail investors, baptized skeptics, and armed Web3 critics, who joyfully celebrated the death of crypto.\n\nAs all eyes were on Ethereum, the community dug in and re-centered its focus to address the rising gas fees. This pivot led to Ethereum adopting a rollup-centric roadmap, setting the stage for innovate products like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Zksync.\n\nThis pivot is today’s story, and in this article I explore how Ethereum has, and will continue, to transition from a monolithic chain to Web3’s preferred settlement layer.\n\nMore specifically, I will cover:\n\n* What makes a blockchain \"monolithic\"\n* Why monolithic blockchains struggle to scale\n* How rollups solve some of these challenges\n* Why rollups represent the first step to a more modular blockchain design space\n* Tradeoffs and risks to disaggregating blockchain components\n\n## A Primer on Monolithic Blockchains\n\nMonolithic blockchains do it all. They execute transactions. They facilitate consensus. They make transaction data available to stakeholders. And they can also settle (i.e., validate and arbitrate) transactions for other blockchains.\n\nLet's define these four components in the context of Ethereum:\n\n### Execution\n\nWhen a miner wants to create a block, it pulls transactions out of a pool, validates each transaction, orders them into a block, and computes the block's state root. The state root is a single output, resembling a snapshot that reflects all the account balances after applying the block's transactions. Here, a miner is executing each transaction to transition the blockchain’s state form A to B (e.g., Alice sends Bob 2 Eth. Old state: Alice 5 ETH, Bob 10 ETH; New State: Alice 3 ETH, Bob 12 ETH).\n\n### Consensus\n\nReaching consensus means nodes agree on the order in which transactions are processed. When a new block (a) is proposed, nodes can reach consensus by explicitly or implicitly attesting to the block. To explicitly attest, nodes submit votes, just like you would in a presidential election. To implicitly attest, nodes choose to build on top of the proposed block, contributing to the longest chain (i.e., Nakamoto Consensus). Ethereum currently follows the Nakamoto Consensus design but plans to transition to a an explicit voting implementation with its shift to proof of stake.\n\nRegardless of the approach, monolithic blockchains must be able to facilitate consensus to ensure everyone agrees on the state of the chain.\n\n### Data Availability\n\nWhen a miner propagates a block, they must include all the transactions required for validators to recreate the miner's proposed state root. If this data is withheld, other nodes have no way of bridging pre-state to post-state. Moreover, applications, developers, and other stakeholders (that aren't running a full node) are unable to track on-chain activity.\n\nMaking this data available is critical to preserve transparency and security, especially in a future where light clients (who can only see block headers) significantly outnumber full nodes.\n\n### Settlement\n\nA settlement refers to a payment that is final and delivered. With cryptocurrencies, a transaction is settled after it is stored and confirmed on a blockchain. Layer 2 blockchains (e.g., rollups) can use select Layer 1 blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) as their dedicated place of settlement. Ethereum frequently settles transactions for other chains because it offers battle tested security and finality.\n\nYou can think of a [settlement layer like the US Supreme Court (in its ideal state): incorruptible, always available, resilient, and called upon only to serve as final arbitrator.](https://consensys.net/research/the-maximally-decentralized-settlement-layer/)\n\n### Pulling it all Together\n\nMonolithic blockchains transition state (execution), facilitate consensus on these state transitions (consensus), ensure stakeholders can see the inputs driving these transitions (data availability), and can settle state transitions for other protocols.\n\nBut it turns out, the monolithic design is cripplingly inefficient. It is bound by the scalability trilemma, which dictates that higher throughput [necessarily means lower security and/or decentralization](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html).\n\n![The scalability trilemma says that there are three properties that a blockchain tries to have, and that, if you stick to \"simple\" techniques, you can only get two of those three. Source: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k7w5Mu5RKgZ3PoOKJnEhc.png?height=553&width=733)\n\n## Why Monolithic Blockchains Struggle to Scale\n\nIn 2017, when Ethereum’s fees started to escape normal bands, many claimed that the community should increase the target block size. To many, this seemed like a reasonable suggestion. After all, if fees are increasing because block space is limited, why not just add more block space? But this introduces a serious side effect.\n\nBy increasing the target block size, nodes must validate and process a longer list of transactions in the same amount of time. As a result, larger blocks require more performant hardware. Hardware, that for some, could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nPut another way, increasing the target block size reduces the amount of people who can afford to run a full node, centralizing the protocol. A more centralized protocol means a less secure network. And at the end of the day, a protocol's value rests on its security and incorruptibility. Even one small exploit is enough to undermine confidence in the protocol and lead to a mass exodus of users.\n\nSo, how do you scale a monolithic blockchain without significantly increasing its target block size?\n\n## Rollups\n\nEthereum requires every node to re-execute every transaction, and this is primarily why it struggles to scale. But what if there was a way to outsource this process to reduce the execution burden on validators?\n\nThis is effectively how a rollup works. A rollup is an off-chain execution layer (essentially a separate EVM compatible blockchain), where a handful of nodes process and send transaction batches down to Ethereum in a highly compressed format. Instead of piling many individual transactions into a block, rollups submit one batch, which holds many tightly compressed micro-transactions (i.e., messages holding just the data needed to bridge the pre- to post state root).\n\n![Basic Rollup workflow. Source: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dI1BqW5qs6ix9giKKxFj7.png?height=775&width=1906)\n\nThe compression off-chain eliminates the need for Ethereum’s \\~11k validators (at Ethereum’s peak) to re-execute these transactions, freeing up precious blockspace and reducing fees for rollup users. And this reduction is meaningful; [a simple ERC20 token transfer costs \\~45000 gas, while an ERC20 token transfer in a rollup costs under 300 gas](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html).\n\nMoreover, by publishing data back to Ethereum, [anyone can locally process all the operations in the rollup, allowing them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or personally start producing transaction batches as a sequencer.](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)\n\nRollups are an elegant solution to the trilemma as they extend Ethereuem’s security profile to new, cheaper, and EVM compatible execution environments. This has led Ethereum’s founders to claim that, [rollups are in the short and medium term, and possibly the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n\nRollups leverage Ethereum's best attributes (security) while managing its weakness (execution). In this way, rollups have illustrated how we can modularize blockchain components to optimize outcomes. Not everything needs to be managed by the same set of nodes. And, in fact, we can continue to unbundle the stack to drive further improvements.\n\n## The Great Unbundling\n\nWhile rollups are a major unlock, they are still limited by their L1's block parameters. Rollups are sending batches back down to the L1 in the form of calldata. When rollups send calldata to an L1, it usually resembles an empty transaction (i.e., no value is exchanged) that encloses data about the transactions processed on the L2 network (i.e., \"the micro-transactions\" referenced earlier).\n\nBecause these batches are processed on an L1, they are subject to gas wars and mainnet congestion. And these gas costs can be significant, in some cases representing over 90% of a rollup’s costs. [Just recently, a major NFT auction (Yuga Labs' Otherside Land Sale) catalyzed so much traffic that even a simple DEX swap on Optimism ran \\~$130.](https://public-grafana.optimism.io/d/9hkhMxn7z/public-dashboard?orgId=1&refresh=5m&from=now-90d&to=now)\n\n### What drives a rollup’s gas costs?\n\n[Adeets_22](https://forum.celestia.org/u/adeets_22), broke down the component parts of a Zk L2 → L1 batch in the below analysis. It illustrates how calldata costs shackle rollup users to Ethereum’s costly gas fees.\n\n![Source: https://forum.celestia.org/t/ethereum-rollup-call-data-pricing-analysis/141](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/odV6YCAePpi7gsptmQXot.png?height=1042&width=1075)\n\nThe key takeaway from this analysis is that the majority of gas spent in a state update event will be spent on making data available on the L1 and not on the verification of the ZK proof itself.\n\n### Reducing costs with Validiums and Volitions\n\nNow imagine if a ZK rollup didn't need to make transaction data available on the L1. Imagine if, instead, it only needed to publish the bare minimum (i.e., a proof and state transition) to the L1, while sending everything else (i.e., the details of each transaction) to a separate, cheaper environment. While rollups decouple execution from the L1, this new model goes one step further and decouples data availability from the L1. [The payment for on-chain data is not required in this model. A state update event only costs the gas needed for verifying the proof.](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4/starkex-deep-dive/data-availability-modes)\n\nThis model has been coined a \"Validium.\"\n\n![Source: https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CD0N9-TnFL_f5N9oOWz-9.png?height=388&width=1038)\n\n\"Volitions\" take this concept even further by letting users easily switch between a rollup and a validium. Some applications, such as decentralized derivatives exchanges, might prefer a validium (because keeping data off-chain preserves the privacy of trades), while others, still wanting to interoperate with applications, might prefer a rollup.

But there are still assumptions! Each time a component is outsourced, unsurprisingly, new risks appear and compound.\n\nArbitrum, for example, does not currently have a fully decentralized sequencer. While proposing batches [is open to anyone, the system employs a privileged sequencer that has priority for submitting transaction batches and ordering transactions.](https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/)\n\n[Moreover, StarkEx, a relatively new validium, doesn't have a fully decentralized DA solution (they use more of a PoA model with an eight-person committee).](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n\nTo hammer the point home -- disaggregating monolithic blockchains can unlock significant scalability, but it also introduces new environments with socioeconomic and technological trust assumptions that require special consideration. If you’re interested in exploring these considerations, L2beat does a great job of outlining tradeoffs/risks across the rollup landscape.\n\n[https://l2beat.com/?view=risk](https://l2beat.com/?view=risk)\n\n### Appendix - EIP 4488: Decreasing Rollup Overhead\n\nValidiums and Volitions offer novel ways to manage the data availability problem without changing the core Ethereum protocol. But the Ethereum community is also tackling this problem from a different angle. EIP 4488 was proposed to [decrease transaction calldata gas cost and add a limit to how much total transaction calldata can be in a block.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n\nIf implemented, this would reduce the cost of L2 → L1 batches, thus reducing the cost of rollup-native transactions. It would also represent a small, but important, step for Ethereum on its path to become Web3’s settlement and data availability layer.\n\nFor more information on this proposal checkout proto.eth’s thread below!\n\n[https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1466114608033411072](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1466114608033411072)\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please follow me on Twitter at @jtseig.\n\nSources:\n\n* <https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html>\n* <https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html>\n* [https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec)\n* <https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/an-introduction-to-optimisms-optimistic-rollup-8450f22629e8>\n* <https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d>\n* https:[//starkware.co/starkex/](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n* https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/\n* https://blog.celestia.org/ethereum-off-chain-data-availability-landscape/", "timestamp": 1654532959, "digest": "bdO358db_-cjYJXtedrF1gNsc_bazR0lna9KchE_mZc", "contributor": "0xf15c734681f9B950e6559aB5Fe200FCe80539A80"}

When people deal with things that make them feel uncomfortable, the brain will produce a variety of excuses and temptations, driving us to choose to do easier and comfortable things. This is what we call procrastination. In fact, from a physiological point of view, procrastination is a biological instinct - \"seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages\". In the face of what we define as \"uncomfortable\", we will instinctively try to avoid it! Even so, we can still overcome procrastination.\nFor example, if you join the \"hardest hit areas\" of procrastination, such as fitness, learning new languages, and exploring unknown areas, you can change your understanding of it from the perspective of consciousness, tell yourself that you can do it and conquer it, and you will make yourself stronger.

A year ago, his annual salary was 100000 yuan. In Beijing, such stories are staged countless times every day. Entrepreneurship and making money are everywhere. If you haven't been \"successful\", there will be countless articles questioning you in your circle of friends, \"why haven't you been successful?\" Something like that. It seems that it is not correct to have not made a fortune.\nGetting rich is not the only criterion for success. I won't say more about it. What I want to say is, of course, I don't object to people starting businesses and making money, but the truth is cruel: not everyone is suitable for starting a business. Many people start a business all their lives, and their income may not be as good as that of working for others honestly. However, many people are encouraged by various entrepreneurial chicken soup, thinking that as long as they dare to do something, they will succeed. It is a waste to do something that is not suitable for them. If you believe in chicken soup, why don't you understand the truth of economics?\nOnce, a colleague asked me, \"are there any economic explanations for people like Lang Xianping who have made so much money but we have not?\" I said: there is really an explanation. I gave an example.\nThere are many excellent weightlifters in China. They can win the first place in the world competition. As for Yao Ming, his basketball level may not even rank among the top 50 in the world, but his income is 100 times and 1000 times that of the top weightlifters in the world.\nThis is not because weightlifters do not work hard, but because the audience of weightlifters is much less than that of basketball. But there is no way. Everyone has his own comparative advantage. Some people's comparative advantage is doomed not to cater to too many audiences.\nIf a weightlifter thinks, \"since playing basketball makes so much money, I will play basketball too. As long as I work hard, I will succeed!\" What will happen? Not only did he not earn as much money as Yao Ming, but he also earned less than he did in weightlifting. Because he gave up his comparative advantage.\nI told my colleagues that in the same way, Lang Xianping made so much money because he was good at catering to a group of people. What you said is more right than him, but there are too few followers. But if you learn from Lang Xianping, the result will be the same: not only will you not make as much money as Lang Xianping, but you will also make less money than you do now. Because catering to langxianping's audience is not your comparative advantage.\nThis is what economists mock themselves: economics cannot tell you how to get rich, but it can tell you why you are poor.\nI believe someone will say: if you don't try, how do you know you are not suitable for entrepreneurship?\nThere is a negative energy paragraph that says: the weasel sets up a sign on the cliff - if you don't fly, how do you know you're not an eagle, and then wait for chicken at the bottom of the cliff.\nI am not against people trying. Comparative advantages are often tried out. But before you try, you must understand that it is not \"as long as you work hard, you will succeed\". Be prepared for failure. At present, in the feast of the foam, many failures are covered up. But ultimately, failure will not be a low probability event.\nEntrepreneurship is not only a matter of endowment, but also a matter of luck. It is not the entrepreneurs themselves but the consumers that determine the success or failure of entrepreneurs. Those successful entrepreneurs are not necessarily more diligent or smarter than the losers. In fact, they just cater to prospective consumers. I do not deny that learning ability, cost control ability, incentive ability and other factors can also help, but the most important thing is consumer selection. Why do some bastards succeed? That's because assholes have their own consumers.\nBack to the friend mentioned earlier. When we are colleagues, we often have some \"balcony conversations\" after work. Once we talked about a problem: Why did the once successful private enterprises finally collapse.\nMy view is that entrepreneurs take risks and bump into the needs of consumers, so there is a rent, which will attract many people to share the rent, but the entrepreneurs themselves do not know this, so slowly, the rent will be shared.", "timestamp": 1654532966, "digest": "eBrMwjc_lcqlCcrLLzLoNxchviCDP3x8R8Le5uznEjQ", "contributor": "0x03623a0D7ACe50de2840aA27b6f921e7b6e3fC65"}
{"id": "L2szid3AKlgDmC1ai_-yZHfst2zAIkXLEhKBzz0rvf4", "title": "NEAR Deep Dive", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eUFhhiUuraXS4UmUDuTSD.png?height=558&width=1228)\n\n### Summary\n\nNEAR is a Layer 1 network that leverages a novel approach to Proof of Stake and sharding to optimize scaling and transaction speeds. NEAR’s consensus mechanism, Doomslug, and sharding framework, Nightshade, collectively enable the protocol to achieve throughput of up to 100,000 transactions per second under ideal conditions and transaction costs of less than $0.001. Beyond its L1 network, NEAR has developed a fully decentralized platform to seamlessly and securely build enterprise-grade applications. Ultimately, NEAR’s core focus can be thought of as a highly performant base layer with a permissionless application platform built on top of it.\n\n### Framing the Problem: Layer 1 and dApp Platform Limitations\n\nThe shortcomings and tradeoffs facing existing Layer 1 networks are well-known. In many cases they are a function of the trilemma between security, scalability, and decentralization, and stem from the protocol’s underlying rules and consensus mechanism. Ethereum, for instance, requires that every node in the network needs to process every single transaction. As a result, it can only process about 20 transactions per second on the main chain. During times of high activity this leads to extremely high gas prices and long confirmation times. In general, a new block is produced every 10–20 seconds, but it actually takes roughly 1.2 minutes for a transaction to be added to the blockchain. Scaling the Ethereum network, therefore, becomes quite challenging as it faces hurdles of expensive transaction prices, low throughput, and high latency.\n\nThese limitations found within the blockchain layer can extend into the applications built on top of this layer. One area in particular is cloud computing. Current solutions fail to bridge the gap between highly performant, decentralized cloud computing and mainstream adoption. Part of the reason is that many of the proposed solutions do not scale, are quite expensive, and do not have industry-grade throughput. As a result, the only viable options are applications that run on traditional cloud services such as AWS and Azure, which come with a variety of inherent risks due to their centralized underpinnings. For instance, users are beholden to any centralized platform to act honestly and maintain their data. Even under the assumption of an honest operator, these platforms are vulnerable to other exogenous threats such as government intervention and hacker attacks to steal, modify, or censor personal user data. They are also subject to risks associated with a single point of failure and decidedly permissioned. Ultimately, users must ask for permission to be able to create content and deploy applications on the dominant platforms. This hinders innovation and monopolizes large ecosystems of Web2.\n\n### Doomslug and Nightshade: Innovating  Layer 1\n\nNEAR attempts to overcome these challenges in a practical way. Starting at the blockchain layer, their instantiation of Doomslug, a novel consensus mechanism, and development of Nightshade, a novel approach to sharding, will fundamentally change the way in which the network scales and is able to deliver extremely performant services. NEAR’s goal is to develop a network that can scale without limit, onboard billions of users, and deploy enterprise-grade applications that run on top of the network.\n\nTo begin, Doomslug enables a set of block producers to create new blocks with a single round of communication per block. Unless a block producer is found to have acted maliciously or inaccurately, in which case they are slashed, each block is considered irreversible.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hfxubziBA6sQn9e3WXVvD.png?height=484&width=1194)\n\nDigging a bit deeper, Doomslug selects a set of block producers at random to take turns producing and broadcasting blocks. Once a specific block height is received by other participants, they then send endorsements on the given block to the block producer assigned to produce and broadcast the next block height. Transactions can only be reversed in the event of a slashing incident and each block only needs to receive an endorsement (or skip message) from more than half of the block producers to be confirmed. Moreover, Doomslug guarantees that even if the network is slow and messages are delayed, a block that contains endorsements from more than half the block producers will be created at some point. This means that the algorithm will not stall under harsh conditions.\n\nSo the key benefits of the Doomslug mechanism is that it facilitates block production after just one round of communication and it maintains liveness even if close to one half of the block producers are offline. Both attributes are incredibly powerful and enables NEAR to leverage Doomslug’s fast block producing functionality.\n\nIn order to optimize scaling and performance, NEAR has developed a sharding solution, Nightshade. In short, a key limitation of blockchains is that they can become congested as user adoption grows and network activity increases. Sharding effectively splits the workload of processing transactions across many different participating nodes and enables a network to scale more efficiently, since each shard only handles a fraction of the total work being done. As a result, sharding can help achieve increased speed and performance without compromising security. Nightshade’s intended purpose is to scale linearly with the number of shards, which will give NEAR the ability to meet the demands for mass adoption of the network and onboard billions of users. Ultimately, Nightshade’s capacity is theoretically limitless, since it can continuously increase the number of shards, which can then handle millions of transactions per second. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7BafnHxFFvRXYtJQEjr7n.png?height=524&width=942)\n\nNightshade’s fundamental difference from other methods of sharding is that it assumes that all of the shards combine together to produce a single block. Moreover, this block is produced with a regular cadence irrespective of whether each individual shard has produced its “chunk” for that specific block height. Therefore, every chunk for each shard will either be present or not. In terms of block production, Nightshade assigns a single validator for each block. This validator must also assemble the chunks which are provided to it during that block’s time period into the period’s block. Nightshade rotates validator assignment through a pool of existing validators.\n\nIn terms of each individual shard and period, Nightshade assigns a single validator to produce its chunk. If that validator is not present (e.g. offline), the shard will stall for that period. Each shard has its own smaller pool of validators which is pulled from the main pool. Similar to the process by which the overall block leader (i.e. validator) rotates, the shard leader position also rotates. Nightshade selects shard leaders from a pool of existing candidates. If a single validator is absent and the shard chunk stalls for one period, there is a high probability that the next validator will be present to continue the chain’s operation in the following period. So in this sense, the chain does not truly stall.\n\nNEAR is deploying Nightshade in stages to help ensure a frictionless and secure transition to the final iteration:\n\n* Phase 0: Simple Nightshade instantiation and splitting the NEAR state into four shards. This significantly increased the throughput of the network. To put this into perspective, Simple Nightshade's deployment increased token transfer transaction speeds from about 800-1000 TPS to a minimum of 2500-3000 TPS. \n* Phase 1: During the next phase, NEAR introduces chunk-only producers, participants who only validate one shard. This creates a role in which participants only produce chunks (shard blocks) for some specific shard and are not required to use inexpensive hardware. without sacrificing the security of the network. This helps increase the total number of validators and improve the decentralization of NEAR as a whole. Overall, the goal of this phase is to have 200-400 total validators, and only a fraction of which will need to run more expensive hardware. \n* Phase 2: After this is complete, NEAR will then shift to eliminating the need for any validators to track all the shards. Both state and processing will be fully sharded at this juncture, hardware requirements of running a block producer on NEAR will be further reduced, making the network more accessible for validators and more decentralized in general. \n* Phase 3: The final iteration of Nightshade will implement a fully functional sharded mainnet with a fixed number of shards. The key feature here is that NEAR will create the ability for the network to dynamically split and merge shards based on resource utilization. This will make NEAR almost infinitely scalable and resilient to short-term usage spikes. Eventually, the network itself will dynamically adjust the number of shards based on their utilization and no validators will need to validate all the shards.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KyOysDVp1x-ayssokoCFM.png?height=540&width=2868)\n\n### NEAR’s Decentralized Application Platform \n\nAs the computational layer is developed, NEAR is building a community-operated, decentralized platform for deploying highly performant dApps. The goal of NEAR’s platform is to serve as the infrastructure for delivering intuitive experiences for end users, scalability for mass adoption, and sustainable business models for developer applications in a truly permissionless nature. The platform’s decentralized design and widely distributed community of node operators ensure that data cannot be censored, modified or removed without the consent of the users that it serves.\n\ndApps running on the platform have access to a shared pool of capital, identity, and data which is owned by its users, rather than a centralized entity. In general, its core functions can be thought of as a decentralized database and serverless computer platform that users leverage to engage in activity. One of the key advantages is its infrastructure composition, which is created from a potentially infinite number of nodes run by users who offer portions of their CPU and hard drive space (e.g. via personal computers, professionally deployed servers). Developers can then create smart contracts and deploy them as if they were deploying to a single server. Overall, the process is very similar to how applications are deployed to existing centralized clouds. The payment and usage model is also similar to existing systems in that NEAR requires users and developers to pay community operators for usage of the infrastructure. Prices are structured upon easily understandable metrics that are not heavily influenced by factors like system congestion, which create undue complexity. Updates to the protocol are generated by the community and must be accepted by a sufficient quorum of the network participants.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9O6vDSPuKX82xAnfYvnXn.png?height=594&width=630)\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of NEAR is its developer-friendly business model in which developers receive tokens proportional to the usage of the apps they create. More specifically, developers are rewarded whenever a contract that they created is called. A portion of the fees (30%) generated by the network are automatically allocated to that contract and can be withdrawn by its developer. This is a powerful incentive that facilitates early infrastructure development (e.g. early contracts will build network effects) and creates a sustainable, long-term business model for developers. \n\nFrom an end-user perspective, NEAR has a decidedly simple onboarding process. Users are not required to provide a wallet address or interact with the native token as a prerequisite of being able to use the applications. NEAR also enables developers to pay for usage on behalf of their users in order to hide the costs of infrastructure in a way that is in line with familiar web usage paradigms. NEAR has made a decided effort around predictable pricing. Part of the protocol’s core focus is on keeping transaction costs in simple terms to allow end-users to experience predictable pricing and less cognitive load when using the platform.\n\n## Performance\n\nIn terms of NEAR’s performance, there are currently 793 nodes online powering the network, with 100 nodes acting as validators. This has helped NEAR realize an average block time of around 1.17 seconds.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZAHGPR-UPld_oFElYqcIc.png?height=578&width=1482)\n\nDaily activity has increased over time, with over 500,000 transactions each day during the month of May and cumulative transactions growing to over 100,000,000 since September 2021.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QtRwGauSgtNnDLniiRUSc.png?height=1002&width=1522)\n\nLooking into recent activity a bit deeper, NEAR serviced over 600,000 transactions nearly each day during the last half of May, with gas prices of 0.0001 $NEAR, making it an extremely cost effective Layer 1 solution.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/klb5t1oyPi0H8_t6A7pvc.png?height=828&width=1472)\n\nDuring this same period the number of daily new users surged and the network achieved its most successful user growth to date.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rn9J6jbZa-vFqFk6MXEfh.png?height=1006&width=1536)\n\nNEAR also realized a significant uptick in active accounts in March 2022 as nearly 1.2 million accounts were using the network on the rolling 30 day average, with daily active accounts reaching over 200,000 during this same period. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oeJPCIhgZd9igUgzXD7C0.png?height=1004&width=1530)\n\n### Tokenomics\n\n**NEAR token use**\n\n$NEAR is the network's native token and has utility and governance functionalities. Users can pay for processing transactions and storing data using $NEAR and validators can stake $NEAR to run a node. Moreover, token holders can participate in governance by staking $NEAR to submit proposals and vote on existing proposals to upgrade the protocol. In general, governance decides how the protocol is updated (e.g. fixing bugs, updating system parameters) and how its resources are allocated (e.g. allocating grants). $NEAR is also used as an incentive mechanism for developers to build applications and receive a portion of the transaction fees that their contract generates.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nIn exchange for producing blocks and chunks and providing security and data availability, validators are rewarded with $NEAR every epoch (i.e. 12 hours). The target value of this reward is computed in such a way that it will be 4.5% of the total supply on an annualized basis. Token holders that do not wish to run nodes can stake their tokens and delegate to validators to earn rewards on the network. Currently this reward is about 9% APY.\n\nDevelopers receive a portion of the fees generated by a particular transaction in the form of a “contract reward.”  The percentage of fees that are allocated to this reward is set to a minimum value of initially 30%. This parameter can be modified by governance and  developers can charge extra fees outside of this mechanism by requiring users to attach funds to the call. So there is a strong incentive for developers to build meaningful smart contracts that go on to be widely used as they are directly compensated in proportion to the usage of these contracts. This also creates an incentive for other developers to continuously iterate existing code in order to capture these fees by optimizing smart contracts wherever possible. Another feature of this approach is that establishing a minimum fee at the system level avoids a “race to the bottom” which results in zero rewards due to competition (or simply the “forking out” of the fee by another developer).\n\nThe NEAR Treasury receives 10% of the inflation, or a total of 0.5% annually. This is provisioned for ecosystem development.\n\n**Agents**\n\nThere are six main agents that operate within the NEAR network. **Validators** run nodes which power the network and provide computational resources and security. **Developers** build dApps which run atop the network, while **users** consume these dApps. There are also **token holders** which can be thought of as simply accounts or applications that maintain a token balance at a given time as well as **third party observers** which proactively monitor the network for fraud detection. Finally, the **NEAR Foundation** is an independent entity which coordinates the governance and protocol upgrade efforts of the network participants.\n\n**Inflation**\n\nNEAR’s token inflation is calculated as such: \n\n`[payouts to validators + the protocol treasury] - the collected tx fees`\n\nThe maximum inflation of the network is 5% per annum. This rate can change over time as the network activity increases and more transaction fees are burned. \n\nUltimately, inflation is determined by how large the epoch reward is for running a validating node. The rate of minting of new tokens is capped at 5% per annum and the effective rate is computed per epoch (every 12 hours) by calculating the expected inflation rate per epoch minus the fees collected during the epoch.  Each portion of fees captured by the platform is removed from inflation, thus reducing the overall inflation of the system as its usage increases. If the system’s usage fees reliably exceed the tokens generated by the inflation, it will become deflationary. \n\n### References & Notes\n\n 1. **<https://near.org/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/ ](https://near.org/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/)**\n 2. **<https://near.org/blog/near-protocol-economics/ ](https://near.org/blog/near-protocol-economics/)**\n 3. **<https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/near-protocol-near-token-near-crypto-blockchain>**\n 4. **<https://docs.near.org/docs/tokens/lockup ](https://docs.near.org/docs/tokens/lockup)**\n 5. **<https://near.org/blog/near-token-supply-and-distribution/ ](https://near.org/blog/near-token-supply-and-distribution/)**\n 6. **<https://wallet.near.org/ ](https://wallet.near.org/)**\n 7. **<https://icodrops.com/near-protocol/>**\n 8. **<https://explorer.near.org/>**\n 9. **<https://near.org/papers/nightshade/>**\n10. **<https://near.org/papers/economics-in-sharded-blockchain/ ](https://near.org/papers/economics-in-sharded-blockchain/)**\n11. **<https://near.org/downloads/Nightshade.pdf ](https://near.org/downloads/Nightshade.pdf)**\n12. **<https://near.org/blog/doomslug-comparison/>**\n13. **<https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption/ ](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption/)**\n14. **<https://awesomenear.com/ ](https://awesomenear.com/)**\n15. **<https://medium.com/nearprotocol/the-authoritative-guide-to-blockchain-sharding-part-1-1b53ed31e060 ](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/the-authoritative-guide-to-blockchain-sharding-part-1-1b53ed31e060)**\n16. **<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cKHLMnulYXc9Mv_AHAHbwNeMtrIUXSuk/view ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cKHLMnulYXc9Mv_AHAHbwNeMtrIUXSuk/view)**", "timestamp": 1654532883, "digest": "Q1UvvhW1FvFx6zv1_EWRfE-Y3zNNGpXLE5tEcJV2m5M", "contributor": "0x94D463c1CFA656A2108DCc76AF179f5744b6147e"}

She came early and left late every day. She remembered in her notebook that she never complained about anything. However, she didn't take out anything that surprised me. Instead, I had to gradually narrow down her scope of work because she poked a big basket several times. Whenever she encountered a problem, her response was always: I didn't think it was like this.\nB is her middle-aged version. She was in her thirties. She became a group leader by changing jobs frequently. Almost all her colleagues complained about her poor specialty. Even so, the boss still hesitated to let her become a full-time employee: after all, she worked so hard\nChinese people have always respected hard work, so there are such allusions as hanging a beam to stab the stock, chiseling a wall to borrow light, and showing off the snow, as well as such golden sentences as \"there is a path for the book mountain, diligence makes up for the clumsy\", \"clumsy birds fly first\" and \"love to fight will win\". It seems that as long as you work hard, you will be able to succeed. Even if it is not successful, others must also have a respect. After all, they have tried their best, which is beyond reproach.\nSo there is a group of people who work hard. They sleep the least when they go to school and go to work the last. They can never finish the work on their desk. They are always diligent and hardworking, but their grades are no more average. You will find that the so-called effort is just inefficient. It takes an hour to complete what others can do in five minutes. It artificially lengthens your life. In short, it is not distracted.\nSuch efforts are nothing more than tactical diligence to cover up strategic laziness. They are neither willing to use their brains and make good plans before \"efforts\", nor willing to make a summary and learn lessons after \"efforts\" fail. They have spirit of the Sisyphus, are not afraid of the failure, and do not have a strong desire for success. They must smash their heads against south wall to prove that they are really working hard.\nEffort is certainly a good thing, but many people are insulting the word with their own practical actions. Some universal values are easy to teach children bad. In our traditional education, too many people are taught to sell coolies and too few are taught to use their brains. Pusongling said that the painstaking people should bear the burden of heaven. They can swallow Wu for 3000 Vietnamese. But if Gou Jian only relies on hard work, what else can Xi Shi do?\nIn this world, most people are lazy, but some people show in action, some people show in thinking. The first is visible laziness, but the second has become hard work in people's eyes.\nIn contrast, I think the first kind of people have a better chance of success. Sometimes a person is lazy in action. If he doesn't want to starve to death, he will at least use his brain in advance to find the best shortcut for himself. It is the second kind of people. They have worked hard all their lives, and the last label is just hard.\nDid Edison work hard enough? It took thousands of experiments to invent the light bulb. However, I dare say that if he tried the same material every time, he would be more than 10000 times diligent and 100 million times useless. Then he succeeded. They said he was a genius.\nEdison also had a golden saying that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. This sentence has been regarded as a classic by countless people, but it is said that this sentence actually has the second half of the sentence that was deleted for political reasons: but the 1% talent is the most important, even more important than the 99% sweat.\nDo you think the Muse will patronize a lazy person at will? Only when a person works very hard and is good at thinking and summarizing in his efforts can he burst out inspiration frequently. Those winners who do things effortlessly in your eyes, they work a thousand times, tenthousand times harder than you.\nFor most people, what you think you are doing is hard work. In fact, it is just physical strength. Why do people give the crown of \"diligence\" to bees instead of dung beetles? It is not that the latter pays less physical strength, but that the crystallization of the former is honey.\nIf you can't create value, your efforts are worthless.", "timestamp": 1654532475, "digest": "DM8jT_-YnH1bXVsxxGl28ajc8XlsmcFML6E83sgTmfQ", "contributor": "0x591dF88f21c391042Fe3f5cA7BEAc948C209262D"}
{"id": "NMWVpB2N4iaJbkpxRj7czNCnNthBGkyD9Aoe50AETJo", "title": "Your heart has the power to change your destiny", "body": "Some time ago, a friend said that I was very lucky to be able to change my profession smoothly by writing. I became a freelancer who made a living by writing. Then I studied psychological counseling and became a psychological consultant. I did what I wanted to do and lived the life I wanted to live.\nI admit that I am lucky that many young people who love writing as much as I have failed to realize their dreams. I know that writing has saved me and changed my destiny. This is my luck, but behind this luck, there is also a hardship and hardship that I have worked alone and silently undertaken.\nAt the age of 20, as a rural girl, I failed the college entrance examination twice in a row, which made me fall into a very depressed mood. During the first three months of my college life, I pretended to be innocent during the day, and after class, I had dinner and chatted with everyone. Every night, I fell into the pain of shame and self blame caused by failure, and insomnia accompanied me for a long time.\nLater, I began to go to the library every day, because in the cold winter, there was heating and books. When I picked up my hobby of reading and writing in junior and senior high school, I got inner peace and healing. After graduation from University, I insisted on working during the day and reading and writing at night. In this way, two years later, I published my first book.\nI have changed my destiny by writing, as have countless other female writers. I have saved myself by writing, both materially and spiritually. Among them, the person I most easily think of is J.K. Rowling. Her experience from difficulty to success is simply a legend.\nIn 1990, Rowling was 25 years old. Her 45 year old mother died of illness, and she did not see her mother's last face. At that time, her work was not smooth. After graduating from University, she worked as a Secretary for a period of time at the University of Manchester. Later, he went to Portugal to teach English to children. Soon, a man named George? Arentes' journalism students fell in love with Rowling at first sight, and they soon got married. But the marriage came and went quickly. Daughter Jessica was born, and Rowling's three-year marriage with her husband came to an end.\nWhen her mother died and her marriage broke down, Rowling returned to England with her 3-month-old daughter and lived in a small apartment without heating in Edinburgh. At that time, she was unemployed and supported herself and her daughter on meager unemployment benefits.\nAs a single mother, Rowling suffered from severe depression and tried to commit suicide.\nIn such an extremely difficult situation, both material and spiritual, Rowling never gave up herself or gave up writing.\nShe sought help and received psychotherapy for about nine months. At the same time, keep writing. In winter, when her narrow house was cold and unable to write, Rowling pushed her stroller to a heated cafe nearby to write. In this way, she wrote her first book Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone. It took five years, but everything never went smoothly. After the story was completed, Rowling went door to door to look for a publishing house, but she met with nails many times, and the manuscript sent out many times was rejected. However, Rowling did not give up. Her story and sincerity finally moved the publishing house of Bloomsbury, and they decided to publish the novel.\nHer efforts finally paid off, and her new book attracted much attention and became a best-selling work as soon as it was published. By the end of 2013, the seven novels in the Harry Potter series had been translated into 65 languages and sold 400million copies worldwide, setting a world record in the publishing industry.\nThe Harry Potter series has changed Rowling's fate, making her one of the richest writers in the world, and she has been ranked as the richest writer in the world for many years. Now, she has already had a complete family with both children and a happy life in Edinburgh.\nMany people will say that J.K. Rowling is very lucky, but in my opinion, behind her luck is that no matter what difficulties and setbacks she encounters in life, she does not give up herself, her favorite writing, or her efforts to rewrite her destiny.\nGenerally speaking, those who believe that \"destiny is in my hands\" are more likely to change their own destiny than those who believe that \"destiny is doomed\".\nHowever, for many women, it is very difficult to believe that they can control their destiny. Although they are dissatisfied with the current situation, they will have a psychological trait similar to \"learned helplessness\". They are used to letting themselves fall into a painful quagmire as if they have accepted their destiny and dare not take the first step to change.\nFor example, some women hate their current jobs very much, but they dare not leave and do what they like. They always feel that they can't do anything and can't support themselves. Some women are unhappy in marriage and dare not choose divorce. They are always afraid that they will not be able to live well alone. This is related to women's inferiority complex, not believing that they have the power to change their destiny.\nIn the process of organizing group psychological growth activities, I have seen that many women always feel that they are not good enough: I am not beautiful enough, I am not thin enough, I am not smart enough, I have a low education background, I am incompetent, and I know too few things... They think that \"I am too lucky\" for what they have gained through their efforts, and that they cannot change what they do not have at present, because \"I do not have that luck\", Their inner inferiority complex often makes them unable to see that they have the energy to change their own destiny.\nThis is related to the strike education they received from childhood and the stereotyped thinking of the whole society towards women. As women, they feel that they are powerless and that they are not as good as men or others. Such a bad self is not worthy of a better life. But the power to change our destiny lies in each of us. You have enough resources and power inside to make your life better.\nSomeone once told me the story of her friend H.\nAfter graduating from H technical secondary school, she worked in a power plant in a third - and fourth tier city in her hometown. At the age of 31, she divorced because her husband drank too much for a long time. Penniless, she took her 6-year-old daughter to work in a strange big city. At the beginning, she washed the hair of customers in a barbershop. She lived in a small partition and bought the cheapest food in the market. Her relatives and friends in the distance decided that she could not get a foothold in the city.\nLater, she saved money for her favorite beauty and makeup courses. After the course, she worked in the studio on weekdays. On the rest day, she did her own private work, made up for the bride and made her own appearance. Later, she opened her own shop. After 7 or 8 years of hard work, she owned nearly 10 chain stores. She not only had her own business, got rid of the original poverty, but also found a happy husband, remarried and had children.\nWhether through writing or other ways, women who have rewritten their own destiny and live their own life are people who never give up themselves, never give up their study and efforts, and have firm faith in life. They dare to make choices, and each choice is rewriting their own life bit by bit. In the face of difficulties, as long as you take a small step to change and make a choice, life is like a domino, pushed forward, and one day you look back and rewrite your destiny.\nI like Tang Wei's recent video called the change destination for skii. In the video, she wiped off her smoky makeup and sounded her inner monologue:\nEvery second, we have a chance to make the next second better. Because it is not luck but choice that really determines fate.\nSo, please let go of your worries and forget that you are not good enough. Please let go of your prejudices, disguises, secular recognition and perfection standards.\nThe power to change our destiny lies in our hearts. Who you are, just because who you want to be.\nAs we all know, Tang Wei did a lot of plays at first, but it didn't seem to be very popular. Later, he boldly starred in lust, caution and became famous at one stroke, but was banned. The ban lasted even two years, but it did not make Tang Wei depressed. She went to the UK to study and learn good English. Later, she came back with new works. We saw late autumn, Hennessy when the moon was full, and later Beijing met Seattle and the golden age. She walked out of her predicament, turned around magnificently, and became a goddess loved by the whole people.\nJ. K. Rowling said, \"once fell to a deep bottom, but became a deep foundation for future rebirth.\" The same is true of Tang Wei and other people who counter attack from difficulties. If your present life is not what you want, which makes you dissatisfied and painful, please don't lose heart, don't give up hope, only you can really save yourself.\nThe power to change your destiny lies in your heart. Your mission is to choose persistence and efforts, step on your own path in reality, take a broader road, and bring yourself closer to your dream life.", "timestamp": 1654532563, "digest": "sa3MwxLR29vgcbI9Jhn0XprO2l8kp8p8lirS86KF3lA", "contributor": "0x08131E947847911ea45952A0FAf04f622a9BCB5F"}

{"id": "pQofg1epbBsHmaC2MBqJ6aAhrXwPqIFlNs0OiTEe9IQ", "title": "Disaggregating the Blockchain Stack", "body": "Today’s cryptoverse is multi-chain and rollup-rich. But this wasn't always the case. Not long ago, Ethereum was without scaling solutions and faced headwinds as new dapps constrained blockspace to the point where a simple transaction required $200 in gas fees. This priced out retail investors, baptized skeptics, and armed Web3 critics, who joyfully celebrated the death of crypto.\n\nAs all eyes were on Ethereum, the community dug in and re-centered its focus to address the rising gas fees. This pivot led to Ethereum adopting a rollup-centric roadmap, setting the stage for innovate products like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Zksync.\n\nThis pivot is today’s story, and in this article I explore how Ethereum has, and will continue, to transition from a monolithic chain to Web3’s preferred settlement layer.\n\nMore specifically, I will cover:\n\n* What makes a blockchain \"monolithic\"\n* Why monolithic blockchains struggle to scale\n* How rollups solve some of these challenges\n* Why rollups represent the first step to a more modular blockchain design space\n* Tradeoffs and risks to disaggregating blockchain components\n\n## A Primer on Monolithic Blockchains\n\nMonolithic blockchains do it all. They execute transactions. They facilitate consensus. They make transaction data available to stakeholders. And they can also settle (i.e., validate and arbitrate) transactions for other blockchains.\n\nLet's define these four components in the context of Ethereum:\n\n### Execution\n\nWhen a miner wants to create a block, it pulls transactions out of a pool, validates each transaction, orders them into a block, and computes the block's state root. The state root is a single output, resembling a snapshot that reflects all the account balances after applying the block's transactions. Here, a miner is executing each transaction to transition the blockchain’s state form A to B (e.g., Alice sends Bob 2 Eth. Old state: Alice 5 ETH, Bob 10 ETH; New State: Alice 3 ETH, Bob 12 ETH).\n\n### Consensus\n\nReaching consensus means nodes agree on the order in which transactions are processed. When a new block (a) is proposed, nodes can reach consensus by explicitly or implicitly attesting to the block. To explicitly attest, nodes submit votes, just like you would in a presidential election. To implicitly attest, nodes choose to build on top of the proposed block, contributing to the longest chain (i.e., Nakamoto Consensus). Ethereum currently follows the Nakamoto Consensus design but plans to transition to a an explicit voting implementation with its shift to proof of stake.\n\nRegardless of the approach, monolithic blockchains must be able to facilitate consensus to ensure everyone agrees on the state of the chain.\n\n### Data Availability\n\nWhen a miner propagates a block, they must include all the transactions required for validators to recreate the miner's proposed state root. If this data is withheld, other nodes have no way of bridging pre-state to post-state. Moreover, applications, developers, and other stakeholders (that aren't running a full node) are unable to track on-chain activity.\n\nMaking this data available is critical to preserve transparency and security, especially in a future where light clients (who can only see block headers) significantly outnumber full nodes.\n\n### Settlement\n\nA settlement refers to a payment that is final and delivered. With cryptocurrencies, a transaction is settled after it is stored and confirmed on a blockchain. Layer 2 blockchains (e.g., rollups) can use select Layer 1 blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) as their dedicated place of settlement. Ethereum frequently settles transactions for other chains because it offers battle tested security and finality.\n\nYou can think of a [settlement layer like the US Supreme Court (in its ideal state): incorruptible, always available, resilient, and called upon only to serve as final arbitrator.](https://consensys.net/research/the-maximally-decentralized-settlement-layer/)\n\n### Pulling it all Together\n\nMonolithic blockchains transition state (execution), facilitate consensus on these state transitions (consensus), ensure stakeholders can see the inputs driving these transitions (data availability), and can settle state transitions for other protocols.\n\nBut it turns out, the monolithic design is cripplingly inefficient. It is bound by the scalability trilemma, which dictates that higher throughput [necessarily means lower security and/or decentralization](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html).\n\n![The scalability trilemma says that there are three properties that a blockchain tries to have, and that, if you stick to \"simple\" techniques, you can only get two of those three. Source: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k7w5Mu5RKgZ3PoOKJnEhc.png?height=553&width=733)\n\n## Why Monolithic Blockchains Struggle to Scale\n\nIn 2017, when Ethereum’s fees started to escape normal bands, many claimed that the community should increase the target block size. To many, this seemed like a reasonable suggestion. After all, if fees are increasing because block space is limited, why not just add more block space? But this introduces a serious side effect.\n\nBy increasing the target block size, nodes must validate and process a longer list of transactions in the same amount of time. As a result, larger blocks require more performant hardware. Hardware, that for some, could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nPut another way, increasing the target block size reduces the amount of people who can afford to run a full node, centralizing the protocol. A more centralized protocol means a less secure network. And at the end of the day, a protocol's value rests on its security and incorruptibility. Even one small exploit is enough to undermine confidence in the protocol and lead to a mass exodus of users.\n\nSo, how do you scale a monolithic blockchain without significantly increasing its target block size?\n\n## Rollups\n\nEthereum requires every node to re-execute every transaction, and this is primarily why it struggles to scale. But what if there was a way to outsource this process to reduce the execution burden on validators?\n\nThis is effectively how a rollup works. A rollup is an off-chain execution layer (essentially a separate EVM compatible blockchain), where a handful of nodes process and send transaction batches down to Ethereum in a highly compressed format. Instead of piling many individual transactions into a block, rollups submit one batch, which holds many tightly compressed micro-transactions (i.e., messages holding just the data needed to bridge the pre- to post state root).\n\n![Basic Rollup workflow. Source: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dI1BqW5qs6ix9giKKxFj7.png?height=775&width=1906)\n\nThe compression off-chain eliminates the need for Ethereum’s \\~11k validators (at Ethereum’s peak) to re-execute these transactions, freeing up precious blockspace and reducing fees for rollup users. And this reduction is meaningful; [a simple ERC20 token transfer costs \\~45000 gas, while an ERC20 token transfer in a rollup costs under 300 gas](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html).\n\nMoreover, by publishing data back to Ethereum, [anyone can locally process all the operations in the rollup, allowing them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or personally start producing transaction batches as a sequencer.](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)\n\nRollups are an elegant solution to the trilemma as they extend Ethereuem’s security profile to new, cheaper, and EVM compatible execution environments. This has led Ethereum’s founders to claim that, [rollups are in the short and medium term, and possibly the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n\nRollups leverage Ethereum's best attributes (security) while managing its weakness (execution). In this way, rollups have illustrated how we can modularize blockchain components to optimize outcomes. Not everything needs to be managed by the same set of nodes. And, in fact, we can continue to unbundle the stack to drive further improvements.\n\n## The Great Unbundling\n\nWhile rollups are a major unlock, they are still limited by their L1's block parameters. Rollups are sending batches back down to the L1 in the form of calldata. When rollups send calldata to an L1, it usually resembles an empty transaction (i.e., no value is exchanged) that encloses data about the transactions processed on the L2 network (i.e., \"the micro-transactions\" referenced earlier).\n\nBecause these batches are processed on an L1, they are subject to gas wars and mainnet congestion. And these gas costs can be significant, in some cases representing over 90% of a rollup’s costs. [Just recently, a major NFT auction (Yuga Labs' Otherside Land Sale) catalyzed so much traffic that even a simple DEX swap on Optimism ran \\~$130.](https://public-grafana.optimism.io/d/9hkhMxn7z/public-dashboard?orgId=1&refresh=5m&from=now-90d&to=now)\n\n### What drives a rollup’s gas costs?\n\n[Adeets_22](https://forum.celestia.org/u/adeets_22), broke down the component parts of a Zk L2 → L1 batch in the below analysis. It illustrates how calldata costs shackle rollup users to Ethereum’s costly gas fees.\n\n![Source: https://forum.celestia.org/t/ethereum-rollup-call-data-pricing-analysis/141](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/odV6YCAePpi7gsptmQXot.png?height=1042&width=1075)\n\nThe key takeaway from this analysis is that the majority of gas spent in a state update event will be spent on making data available on the L1 and not on the verification of the ZK proof itself.\n\n### Reducing costs with Validiums and Volitions\n\nNow imagine if a ZK rollup didn't need to make transaction data available on the L1. Imagine if, instead, it only needed to publish the bare minimum (i.e., a proof and state transition) to the L1, while sending everything else (i.e., the details of each transaction) to a separate, cheaper environment. While rollups decouple execution from the L1, this new model goes one step further and decouples data availability from the L1. [The payment for on-chain data is not required in this model. A state update event only costs the gas needed for verifying the proof.](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4/starkex-deep-dive/data-availability-modes)\n\nThis model has been coined a \"Validium.\"\n\n![Source: https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CD0N9-TnFL_f5N9oOWz-9.png?height=388&width=1038)\n\n\"Volitions\" take this concept even further by letting users easily switch between a rollup and a validium. Some applications, such as decentralized derivatives exchanges, might prefer a validium (because keeping data off-chain preserves the privacy of trades), while others, still wanting to interoperate with applications, might prefer a rollup. Volitions allow users and applications to oscillate between solutions depending on their data availability preferences.\n\n![Source: https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jA00-2BMN1LuU4zPnmGet.png?height=384&width=1038)\n\n## Challenges with Modularization\n\nUnbundling blockchain components provides better scaling and cheaper fees without significantly compromising trust assumptions. But there are still assumptions! Each time a component is outsourced, unsurprisingly, new risks appear and compound.\n\nArbitrum, for example, does not currently have a fully decentralized sequencer. [While proposing batches is open to anyone, the system employs a privileged sequencer that has priority for submitting transaction batches and ordering transactions.](https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/)\n\n[Moreover, StarkEx, a relatively new validium, doesn't have a fully decentralized DA solution (they use more of a PoA model with an eight-person committee).](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n\nTo hammer the point home -- disaggregating monolithic blockchains can unlock significant scalability, but it also introduces new environments with socioeconomic and technological trust assumptions that require special consideration. If you’re interested in exploring these considerations, L2beat does a great job of outlining tradeoffs/risks across the rollup landscape.\n\n[https://l2beat.com/?view=risk](https://l2beat.com/?view=risk)\n\n### Appendix - EIP 4488: Decreasing Rollup Overhead\n\nValidiums and Volitions offer novel ways to manage the data availability problem without changing the core Ethereum protocol. But the Ethereum community is also tackling this problem from a different angle. EIP 4488 was proposed to [decrease transaction calldata gas cost and add a limit to how much total transaction calldata can be in a block.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n\nIf implemented, this would reduce the cost of L2 → L1 batches, thus reducing the cost of rollup-native transactions. It would also represent a small, but important, step for Ethereum on its path to become Web3’s settlement and data availability layer.\n\nFor more information on this proposal checkout proto.eth’s thread below!\n\n[https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1466114608033411072](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1466114608033411072)\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please follow me on Twitter at @jtseig.\n\nSources:\n\n* <https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html>\n* <https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html>\n* [https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec)\n* <https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/an-introduction-to-optimisms-optimistic-rollup-8450f22629e8>\n* <https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d>\n* https:[//starkware.co/starkex/](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n* https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/\n* https://blog.celestia.org/ethereum-off-chain-data-availability-landscape/", "timestamp": 1654532901, "digest": "bdO358db_-cjYJXtedrF1gNsc_bazR0lna9KchE_mZc", "contributor": "0xf15c734681f9B950e6559aB5Fe200FCe80539A80"}

I’ve been a fan of Jon Sanchez’s textured digital fashion garments for some time. A long time. A very long time. \n\nThe impeccable detail on his distinguishable balaclava-inspired headpieces and the virtual mossy softness of his oversized puffers have made Jon stand out as a leading web3 fashion designer. \n\nWhat makes him even more appealing as a new-age fashion revolutionary is the fact that he did not jump through the traditional hoops of fashion design. He is completely self-taught. This gives the rest of us an ounce of hope, right…\n\n## A star is born\n\nOriginally from Irun, Spain, Jon Sanchez graduated from high school and accepted a job as a bricklayer in order to pay for his tuition for studying video production. After working in the video department of major Spanish TV broadcaster RTVE, Jon desired a new creative pursuit. \n\n“I got a taste for digital fashion and decided to learn it on my own with different courses and doing tests until I found a style to follow,” Jon says. \n\n“I was seeing 3D artists using clothes and I thought, ‘I also want to create clothes and experiment’. This is where I am now. I think it has a plus to ‘everyday fashion’. We can get out of the legible.”\n\n## Iconic patterns and a signature style\n\nErin, Balu, Calvin and Poe are a foursome who are particularly close to my heart. I can’t see their faces but I feel like I’m in tune with their individual personalities because of their patterned, fluffy outfits. The mask is Jon’s “thing”, even though he is still exploring his personal style, because “many times they express more than our own face”, he says.\n\n### Erin\n\n![Credit: Jon Sanchez](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ugj5XM17Myc5CJhD153Q3.jpg?height=4375&width=3500)\n\n### Balu\n\n![Credit: Balu](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5TT2R7a0i9QBjyQdOsUlK.jpg?height=4375&width=3500)\n\n### Calvin\n\n![Credit: Jon Sanchez](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YcygAbxLnYZd2E0bmhXNz.jpg?height=4375&width=3500)\n\n### Poe\n\n![Credit: Jon Sanchez](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UwlfaalmLC-rIPu_KFY5U.jpg?height=4375&width=3500)\n\nWhen it comes to crafting one of these looks, Jon tends towards the streetwear vibe. As he doesn’t consider himself a fashion designer so to speak, he usually turns to social media platforms like good ol’ Pinterest as a point of reference and sketches out his own designs from there. \n\n“I end up changing half of it when I start using CLO 3D, though,” Jon says. “I work on the garments there and usually texture them in Cinema 4D.”\n\nFor me, the texture of these garments is everything. The stitching, the depth, the digital material - it’s flawless, in my opinion. I just want to bear hug you, Erin. Jon has a soft spot for all of his designs but creating Balu’s jacket was pretty memorable: “I loved drawing the pattern on it.”\n\nDrawing and digital garment creation aside, Jon is heavy into fingerboarding - a “fingerboard geek” he calls himself. \n\n“I have a big collection. I started in 2009 with a forum and I made great friendships that are still there today. I've been to some ‘competitions’ where many people meet. I have colleagues who make very neat wooden boards. It is pure craftsmanship,” he says.\n\nMini kickflips and digital sewing: not a bad way to spend a Saturday. \n\n \n\n***Connect with Jon Sanchez on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/slamthings).***\n\n \n\n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654532644, "digest": "5EYmgnrpX91QPPuhLGsRf1i5RgqdVlJq1p_kO-7p8GI", "contributor": "0x90915a5F6d7C08a0B09FEe63f1708aeD9524Efa0"}

He ran to the Buddha and cried bitterly, telling him about the hardships of life: he was half dead working every day but couldn't earn a few money.\nAfter crying for a long time, he suddenly began to complain: \"this society is too unfair. Why do the rich relax every day while the poor suffer every day?\"\nBuddha smiled and asked, \"how can you feel fair?\"\nThe poor man said hurriedly, \"let the rich be as poor and do the same work as me. If the rich are still rich, I will not complain.\"\nThe Buddha nodded and said, \"OK!\" With that, the Buddha turned a rich man into a man as poor as a poor man. And they were given a mountain. The coal dug every day could be sold to buy food that day, and the coal mountain could be dug up within one month.\nThe poor and the rich dig together. The poor are used to doing rough work. Digging coal is a piece of cake for him. Soon he dug a truck of coal and took it to the market to sell money. With the money, he bought all the delicious food and took it home to satisfy his wife and children.\nThe rich man had not done any heavy work at ordinary times. He stopped digging for a while, and was still very tired and sweating. In the evening, he managed to dig a cart and take it to the market. He bought only a few hard steamed buns with the money he got, and saved the rest.\nThe next day the poor got up early and began to dig coal, while the rich went to the market. After a while, two poor people came back. The two poor people were very rich. They began to dig coal for the rich without saying a word. In only one morning, the rich man commanded the two poor people to dig out several carts of coal. The rich sold the coal and hired several coolies. At the end of the day, in addition to giving workers wages, he still had several times more money than the poor people earned.\nA month passed quickly. The poor only dug a corner of the coal mountain. The money they earned every day bought delicious food and drink. There was basically no surplus. The rich man had already ordered the workers to dig up all the coal and made a lot of money. He invested the money and started a business. Soon he became rich again, and the poor would no longer complain.\nSuccess lies not in how much you can do, but in how much you can do with the help of how many people!\nLearn to borrow!

Cash\n   \"The purchasing power of 100 yuan in 2014 is a fraction of that of 2004. When you go to McDonald's, you may not buy much. However, there is a big difference between buying a house, hiring a nanny, seeing a doctor, and having your children attend training classes. In 2004, the monthly salary of nannies in Shenzhen was 1000 yuan. At present, it costs 3500 to 4000 yuan; in communities with poor locations, the new house was 6000 yuan per square meter, and now it costs at least 35000 yuan\", This is the purchasing power depreciation data surveyed by the media. With the rising prices, cash will become less and less valuable in 10 years.\n2. House\n   What is the per capita residential area in China today, and what is the residential area under construction. The consequence of the inverted pyramid family created by family planning is that they own a suite, and both parents own a suite... Eventually these houses will be left to future generations, while vacant houses need to pay property tax. Who would be willing to keep so many houses in hand, and what are the consequences of everyone selling their houses?\n3. Automobile\n   Cars have basically become very common consumer goods. According to media statistics, the number of cars in China has exceeded 300million, and this number is increasing. All major automobile manufacturers have made great efforts to build factories in China, and vigorously promoted sales and fought a price war. It can be predicted that cars will be much cheaper in 10 years.\n4. Mobile phone\n   Today's mobile phones are much cheaper than they were 10 years ago. In the past, they used to buy mobile phones for free, but now they charge mobile phones for free. In addition, mobile phone businesses have launched new concepts. Mobile phones are just an entrance and a tool to collect your personal information. In the future, I'm afraid the giants will compete to send you mobile phones.\n   The most expensive thing in ten years\n5.

It seems that you are no longer that carefree child at last. You begin to understand that this society has a requirement for individuals called \"success\". And you want it.\nTell me what success is in your heart. As a businessman, he is rich. He does not want to be Bill Gates, but does not frown when swiping his card; Or like a star, the whole world is paying attention to you when you step on the red carpet; Or simply, you want the people you like to like you, and you can get everything you want - a little reputation, a good life, happy friends, good love, enough time to travel around the world.\nIt's always good to have a dream. No matter what kind of success you want, how can you get what you want? I have no standard answer, but generally speaking, successful people have two qualities: learning ability and balance ability. They are too good at learning and pondering things. Whether there is a class or not, they can get nutrients from everything that happens around them.\nPeople with learning ability must be sensitive and have a passion for continuous attention to everything related to their major. Learning ability also includes creating learning opportunities for yourself and letting others give you learning opportunities.\nThe ability to balance is actually more important. I also understand later. The ability to balance is the ability to live. You may not realize the importance of this ability until you work. Because it is relatively easy to be a workaholic, but it is difficult to be able to work and live comfortably. But you can't even be a learner now. You'll find that boring. But the main reason is that you think you are smart enough. You believe in your talent.\nEveryone believes in his talent when he is young. But all the achievements of man must resist the erosion of cowardice and laziness. Whether many things can be done well or not has nothing to do with talent. It just depends on whether you are sincere. That is, the purity of the mind. You want those shiny things, you can't help paying. Don't fool yourself or others.\nDo you think you are good enough, so all opportunities should come to you? So I ask you, have you really paid anything for what you like? The real love is that you do it all the time and don't want to return it, but you still feel happy. If you don't feel that way, maybe you're just playing with tickets.\nThere are two kinds of truth in the world, one is the truth of things, the other is the truth of people. Since we were young, we have always focused on the principle of things. It is relatively easy to have success. Because those laws and standards never change because of people. How capital operates and how the market reacts are inseparable. If you know how to learn, you will have it.\nThe human principle is your internal standard: when giving money to the beggar curled up in the corner, you will squat down and gently put down the coin; You understand why mother is angry, and you can hug her, comfort her and persuade her; After you have been calculated, you know how to get justice properly and skillfully.\nIn the human truth, you can succeed only when you learn to balance. A successful businessman may be a failed father. In this field, there is no absolute standard, it is difficult to say what is success. This gave birth to the so-called \"Besieged City\". It is good to pursue your dreams, but be prepared to pay the price. It is normal to have gains and losses. However, whether a successful person is happy depends on your excellent balance ability.\nThere is a place called \"success club\" in the world, where people are not angry. Because there is no right to be angry before success, and there is no reason to be angry after success.\nSo don't complain.

{"id": "cmeaezPZUs0TZoUhbgcdoCbyHHqzUQwssP4xyQzNSrg", "title": "Disaggregating the Blockchain Stack", "body": "Today’s cryptoverse is multi-chain and rollup-rich. But this wasn't always the case. Not long ago, Ethereum was without scaling solutions and faced headwinds as new dapps constrained blockspace to the point where a simple transaction required $200 in gas fees. This priced out retail investors, baptized skeptics, and armed Web3 critics, who joyfully celebrated the death of crypto.\n\nAs all eyes were on Ethereum, the community dug in and re-centered its focus to address the rising gas fees. This pivot led to Ethereum adopting a rollup-centric roadmap, setting the stage for innovate products like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Zksync.\n\nThis pivot is today’s story, and in this article I explore how Ethereum has, and will continue, to transition from a monolithic chain to Web3’s preferred settlement layer.\n\nMore specifically, I will cover:\n\n* What makes a blockchain \"monolithic\"\n* Why monolithic blockchains struggle to scale\n* How rollups solve some of these challenges\n* Why rollups represent the first step to a more modular blockchain design space\n* Tradeoffs and risks to disaggregating blockchain components\n\n## A Primer on Monolithic Blockchains\n\nMonolithic blockchains do it all. They execute transactions. They facilitate consensus. They make transaction data available to stakeholders. And they can also settle (i.e., validate and arbitrate) transactions for other blockchains.\n\nLet's define these four components in the context of Ethereum:\n\n### Execution\n\nWhen a miner wants to create a block, it pulls transactions out of a pool, validates each transaction, orders them into a block, and computes the block's state root. The state root is a single output, resembling a snapshot that reflects all the account balances after applying the block's transactions. Here, a miner is executing each transaction to transition the blockchain’s state form A to B (e.g., Alice sends Bob 2 Eth. Old state: Alice 5 ETH, Bob 10 ETH; New State: Alice 3 ETH, Bob 12 ETH).\n\n### Consensus\n\nReaching consensus means nodes agree on the order in which transactions are processed. When a new block (a) is proposed, nodes can reach consensus by explicitly or implicitly attesting to the block. To explicitly attest, nodes submit votes, just like you would in a presidential election. To implicitly attest, nodes choose to build on top of the proposed block, contributing to the longest chain (i.e., Nakamoto Consensus). Ethereum currently follows the Nakamoto Consensus design but plans to transition to a an explicit voting implementation with its shift to proof of stake.\n\nRegardless of the approach, monolithic blockchains must be able to facilitate consensus to ensure everyone agrees on the state of the chain.\n\n### Data Availability\n\nWhen a miner propagates a block, they must include all the transactions required for validators to recreate the miner's proposed state root. If this data is withheld, other nodes have no way of bridging pre-state to post-state. Moreover, applications, developers, and other stakeholders (that aren't running a full node) are unable to track on-chain activity.\n\nMaking this data available is critical to preserve transparency and security, especially in a future where light clients (who can only see block headers) significantly outnumber full nodes.\n\n### Settlement\n\nA settlement refers to a payment that is final and delivered. With cryptocurrencies, a transaction is settled after it is stored and confirmed on a blockchain. Layer 2 blockchains (e.g., rollups) can use select Layer 1 blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) as their dedicated place of settlement. Ethereum frequently settles transactions for other chains because it offers battle tested security and finality.\n\nYou can think of a [settlement layer like the US Supreme Court (in its ideal state): incorruptible, always available, resilient, and called upon only to serve as final arbitrator.](https://consensys.net/research/the-maximally-decentralized-settlement-layer/)\n\n### Pulling it all Together\n\nMonolithic blockchains transition state (execution), facilitate consensus on these state transitions (consensus), ensure stakeholders can see the inputs driving these transitions (data availability), and can settle state transitions for other protocols.\n\nBut it turns out, the monolithic design is cripplingly inefficient. It is bound by the scalability trilemma, which dictates that higher throughput [necessarily means lower security and/or decentralization](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html).\n\n![The scalability trilemma says that there are three properties that a blockchain tries to have, and that, if you stick to \"simple\" techniques, you can only get two of those three. Source: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k7w5Mu5RKgZ3PoOKJnEhc.png?height=553&width=733)\n\n## Why Monolithic Blockchains Struggle to Scale\n\nIn 2017, when Ethereum’s fees started to escape normal bands, many claimed that the community should increase the target block size. To many, this seemed like a reasonable suggestion. After all, if fees are increasing because block space is limited, why not just add more block space? But this introduces a serious side effect.\n\nBy increasing the target block size, nodes must validate and process a longer list of transactions in the same amount of time. As a result, larger blocks require more performant hardware. Hardware, that for some, could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nPut another way, increasing the target block size reduces the amount of people who can afford to run a full node, centralizing the protocol. A more centralized protocol means a less secure network. And at the end of the day, a protocol's value rests on its security and incorruptibility. Even one small exploit is enough to undermine confidence in the protocol and lead to a mass exodus of users.\n\nSo, how do you scale a monolithic blockchain without significantly increasing its target block size?\n\n## Rollups\n\nEthereum requires every node to re-execute every transaction, and this is primarily why it struggles to scale. But what if there was a way to outsource this process to reduce the execution burden on validators?\n\nThis is effectively how a rollup works. A rollup is an off-chain execution layer (essentially a separate EVM compatible blockchain), where a handful of nodes process and send transaction batches down to Ethereum in a highly compressed format. Instead of piling many individual transactions into a block, rollups submit one batch, which holds many tightly compressed micro-transactions (i.e., messages holding just the data needed to bridge the pre- to post state root).\n\n![Basic Rollup workflow. Source: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dI1BqW5qs6ix9giKKxFj7.png?height=775&width=1906)\n\nThe compression off-chain eliminates the need for Ethereum’s \\~11k validators (at Ethereum’s peak) to re-execute these transactions, freeing up precious blockspace and reducing fees for rollup users. And this reduction is meaningful; [a simple ERC20 token transfer costs \\~45000 gas, while an ERC20 token transfer in a rollup costs under 300 gas](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html).\n\nMoreover, by publishing data back to Ethereum, [anyone can locally process all the operations in the rollup, allowing them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or personally start producing transaction batches as a sequencer.](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)\n\nRollups are an elegant solution to the trilemma as they extend Ethereuem’s security profile to new, cheaper, and EVM compatible execution environments. This has led Ethereum’s founders to claim that, [rollups are in the short and medium term, and possibly the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n\nRollups leverage Ethereum's best attributes (security) while managing its weakness (execution). In this way, rollups have illustrated how we can modularize blockchain components to optimize outcomes. Not everything needs to be managed by the same set of nodes. And, in fact, we can continue to unbundle the stack to drive further improvements.\n\n## The Great Unbundling\n\nWhile rollups are a major unlock, they are still limited by their L1's block parameters. Rollups are sending batches back down to the L1 in the form of calldata. When rollups send calldata to an L1, it usually resembles an empty transaction (i.e., no value is exchanged) that encloses data about the transactions processed on the L2 network (i.e., \"the micro-transactions\" referenced earlier).\n\nBecause these batches are processed on an L1, they are subject to gas wars and mainnet congestion. And these gas costs can be significant, in some cases representing over 90% of a rollup’s costs. [Just recently, a major NFT auction (Yuga Labs' Otherside Land Sale) catalyzed so much traffic that even a simple DEX swap on Optimism ran \\~$130.](https://public-grafana.optimism.io/d/9hkhMxn7z/public-dashboard?orgId=1&refresh=5m&from=now-90d&to=now)\n\n### What drives a rollup’s gas costs?\n\n[Adeets_22](https://forum.celestia.org/u/adeets_22), broke down the component parts of a Zk L2 → L1 batch in the below analysis. It illustrates how calldata costs shackle rollup users to Ethereum’s costly gas fees.\n\n![Source: https://forum.celestia.org/t/ethereum-rollup-call-data-pricing-analysis/141](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/odV6YCAePpi7gsptmQXot.png?height=1042&width=1075)\n\nThe key takeaway from this analysis is that the majority of gas spent in a state update event will be spent on making data available on the L1 and not on the verification of the ZK proof itself.\n\n### Reducing costs with Validiums and Volitions\n\nNow imagine if a ZK rollup didn't need to make transaction data available on the L1. Imagine if, instead, it only needed to publish the bare minimum (i.e., a proof and state transition) to the L1, while sending everything else (i.e., the details of each transaction) to a separate, cheaper environment. While rollups decouple execution from the L1, this new model goes one step further and decouples data availability from the L1. [The payment for on-chain data is not required in this model. A state update event only costs the gas needed for verifying the proof.](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4/starkex-deep-dive/data-availability-modes)\n\nThis model has been coined a \"Validium.\"\n\n![Source: https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CD0N9-TnFL_f5N9oOWz-9.png?height=388&width=1038)\n\n\"Volitions\" take this concept even further by letting users easily switch between a rollup and a validium. Some applications, such as decentralized derivatives exchanges, might prefer a validium (because keeping data off-chain preserves the privacy of trades), while others, still wanting to interoperate with applications, might prefer a rollup. Volitions allow users and applications to oscillate between solutions depending on their data availability preferences.\n\n![Source: https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jA00-2BMN1LuU4zPnmGet.png?height=384&width=1038)\n\n## Challenges with Modularization\n\nUnbundling blockchain components provides better scaling and cheaper fees without significantly compromising trust assumptions. But there are still assumptions! Each time a component is outsourced, unsurprisingly, new risks appear and compound.\n\nArbitrum, for example, does not currently have a fully decentralized sequencer. While proposing batches [is open to anyone, the system employs a privileged sequencer that has priority for submitting transaction batches and ordering transactions.](https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/)\n\n[Moreover, StarkEx, a relatively new validium, doesn't have a fully decentralized DA solution (they use more of a PoA model with an eight-person committee).](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n\nTo hammer the point home -- disaggregating monolithic blockchains can unlock significant scalability, but it also introduces new environments with socioeconomic and technological trust assumptions that require special consideration. If you’re interested in exploring these considerations, L2beat does a great job of outlining tradeoffs/risks across the rollup landscape.\n\n[https://l2beat.com/?view=risk](https://l2beat.com/?view=risk)\n\n### Appendix - EIP 4488: Decreasing Rollup Overhead\n\nValidiums and Volitions offer novel ways to manage the data availability problem without changing the core Ethereum protocol. But the Ethereum community is also tackling this problem from a different angle. EIP 4488 was proposed to [decrease transaction calldata gas cost and add a limit to how much total transaction calldata can be in a block.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n\nIf implemented, this would reduce the cost of L2 → L1 batches, thus reducing the cost of rollup-native transactions. It would also represent a small, but important, step for Ethereum on its path to become Web3’s settlement and data availability layer.\n\nFor more information on this proposal checkout proto.eth’s thread below!\n\n[https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1466114608033411072](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1466114608033411072)\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please follow me on Twitter at @jtseig.\n\nSources:\n\n* <https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html>\n* <https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html>\n* [https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec)\n* <https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/an-introduction-to-optimisms-optimistic-rollup-8450f22629e8>\n* <https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d>\n* https:[//starkware.co/starkex/](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n* https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/\n* https://blog.celestia.org/ethereum-off-chain-data-availability-landscape/", "timestamp": 1654532972, "digest": "bdO358db_-cjYJXtedrF1gNsc_bazR0lna9KchE_mZc", "contributor": "0xf15c734681f9B950e6559aB5Fe200FCe80539A80"}

Our predecessors use this theory to spur our growth.\nOnce upon a time, I came out in such an environment. The school teachers told us to study hard, attend classes on time, have ideals, and listen to the teachers and parents, so that we can be happy and succeed. Looking back at the moment, I still remember the painstaking efforts of high school teachers on the podium more than ten years ago. I also remember that junior high school teachers punished me for clearing the snow and making me stop because I was naughty. They all wanted to make us successful and happy years later.\nBut do we feel happiness deeply? It seems not. Instead, more and more people feel that I am not happy enough. CCTV once did a boring roadside talk show and asked an old man if he was happy. The uncle said, \"my name is Zeng, not Fu.\" This is actually an irony. I have forgotten what the word \"happiness\" is.\nIn fact, in my opinion, success and happiness do not depend on how many things you have done right in life, but on how many times you have stood up from your failures in life.\nIn 2004, I graduated from college. Under the persuasion of my parents, I still didn't want to take the postgraduate exam. I think the society is so big, and I want to work hard. I have a cavity of blood, I have a cavity of passion, and the society can do anything for me! After looking for a job and asking about the salary, I found that I was wrong. So much blood and passion is worth 1800 yuan a month. You can't even pay taxes. My parents were worried, and I was also angry, but the depressed mood did not last long. I told my parents that I would resign and take the postgraduate examination next year. My parents were very nervous and told me to make a careful decision. If you don't pass the exam, it will be very difficult for you to find a job again. I understand my parents' worries and know my desperate decision, but I don't recognize my current failure, don't come out resolutely, and don't break through those so-called worries. Why can I laugh more happily after three years.\nIn the past 10 years, I encountered my first failure in my career. Because I didn't pay attention to self-management and asked for instructions from leaders in advance, I was punished by the company at the second level. At that time, I was so unruly that I finally ate the bitter fruit. Behind the bitter fruit was the darkness you could never understand under the sun. Because of this second level punishment, I experienced hardships in my career development in the next five years. Because of the second level punishment record, I missed several opportunities for promotion, and I almost missed the job transfer opportunities that were very important for my career transition; I also missed the opportunity to appear in the company's glorious history of 20 years, 20 people and 20 events. Dad told me to keep a low profile and lick the wound in the corner. Don't let others laugh at it. But I feel that I have come out of this failure. I can say to yesterday's me bravely: failure is not terrible, and it is terrible not to stand up.\nI was positive. Because of this failure in my career path, I thought about my social skills for the first time. It made me think for a long time and continue to improve; I have also found the voice from the bottom of my heart, leading myself to the career direction suitable for me, and thus I have known a broader world; Therefore, I have a habit of thinking and summarizing constantly. I have a very tacit understanding with the company's publicity department. Although I regret that I have not had the opportunity to select 20 people and 20 events in 20 years, I am honored to be invited by the organizing group to give comments and comments, and leave my name on the precious album.\nLife is not made up of success over and over again. That is too false, and you will not realize the deep joy of success after failure. The understanding of life, the desire for success, the light understanding, the longing for life and the definition of happiness will become common and profound because of your perspective after stepping out of the shadow.\nThe reason for this passage is that I have seen many stronger friends than I have. They rolled through the rugged road with determination. Now their understanding of happiness is so profound and their smiles are so gratifying that I have the impulse to write this passage.\nBe brave and walk out of failure is the success above success.", "timestamp": 1654533039, "digest": "Leo48QwRRhfrsyeN3kVEGa-NVgnh-JnFg-PJnE2083o", "contributor": "0x86D9a0E437f663CC6a28756260F4CF6E26aC692a"}

Success is not as fast as spending two yuan on a lottery ticket.\n\"Not succeeding but wanting to succeed\" can easily become a state, and this state has countless Rationality - \"you see, Ma Yun can succeed\", \"the process before success is difficult\" and \"you can only be a person if you eat bitterness\".\nAll inspirational stories can be attached by those who want to succeed to encourage themselves, which has also become the driving force for many people to pursue success without leaving their homes - today I delay enjoying it for a better tomorrow.\nThis logic is certainly no problem, but the problem is that this kind of patience may be longer than the imagination at that time. You have no car, no house, no home, no savings, no girlfriend... You have nothing except full faith and determination to never admit defeat.\ntwo\nPatience is difficult, and this spirit of sacrifice is a bit like a cult that bewitches people. You do something, but you are in pain. You are immersed in pain, because it makes you feel noble. You persist in your dreams, because all persistence is only persistence itself. If you give up persistence, you can't find the meaning of existence.\nSo you are anxious, just like a gambler who hasn't seen the money back. You just keep throwing money in. Anyway, you have been unhappy for many years. You can't give up halfway. You imagine that one day you will suddenly succeed. This scene appears many times every day, because only this can help you fight against frustration and pain every day.\nGradually you become anxious and feel that time can no longer be wasted. You give up entertainment and boredom to pass the time. Your head is wondering why the God of luck has not visited.\nthree\nIs it really just a short notice? It seems that there are many feet missing, the torture is not over yet, and you immerse yourself in pain - why hasn't it reached the moment of big turnover? Why hasn't the long lost success come yet?\nI know some painters, filmmakers and musicians, many of whom live such a life. However, because of their personality, not everyone is worried. Many people can really find fun from daily life and live in peace and contentment for a lifetime, but there are also many who are anxious and wait for no time.\nAnxious people are not easy to succeed. Because of worry, my heart is unstable. I have a lot of things to settle down, and all kinds of relationships are not very smooth, so I can only encounter happiness rather than worry. When you encounter a good thing, you will naturally have the pleasure of revenge. If you encounter a setback, it must be the house leakage and the rain. You can't stand any fluctuations.\nBecause of worry, small success is not worth looking at. It's like playing mahjong. Who thinks he can have a flush with flowers? Therefore, if you give up the opportunity to make a living, you may not get anything in the end.\nThere are also articles about chicken soup for the soul, warning young people not to worry. There is still time and a long way to go. However, we need to know that this anxiety is rooted in a self explanatory value. Where is it so easy to change behavior without changing logic?\nfour\nWhen I worked in Shenzhen, I found that there were not only many young people, but also more impatient young people in this city. On Shennan Road in the morning, there were young people with briefcases. It seemed that they could not wait for a moment to tell their dreams. There are too many examples of getting rich overnight, which has stimulated our ambitions and emotions.\nThe other side of ambition is, of course, loss. It is said that the suicide rate and the incidence rate of mental diseases in Shenzhen have long been among the highest in China. So there are so many Foxconn factories, most of which have jumped from buildings in Shenzhen. It is not necessarily that the factories in Shenzhen are more sweaty. It is also possible that more people are jealous and anxious.\nThere is a rhythm in many things, which is not completely transferred by people's will and efforts. When Xiangyu committed suicide, when chentianhua threw himself into the sea, and when Haizi was lying on the rail, they did not necessarily believe that miracles might happen later.\nRespecting fate and being content with life may, under the same conditions, lead to success more easily than being anxious.\nFinally, I wish you peace, everyone who has read the article.

{"id": "GijgC6HQDsfVDH_MI1qvorT4tY8LIZjYHiqCVBkuA8o", "title": "How Decentralized Organizations Win (And Lose)", "body": "For all of our excitement about the ways that DAOs could usher in a revolution of collective action, we should remember: they wouldn’t be the first one, and they won’t be the last.\n\nOur current world is designed primarily around large centralized structures like national governments, universities, and corporations. But this hasn’t always been the case—[cycles of decentralization and centralization](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8) define the ebb and flow of major periods of human history.\n\nWe seem to be in a late-stage period of the modern era, where centralized institutions are failing. So it’s natural to run in the other direction, to swing the pendulum toward decentralized maximalism. Maximalism is the strategy of a cancer cell. Successful complex systems are diverse, permeable, and inherently pluralistic.\n\nIf we’re going to run screaming from centralization, we need to have a sense of where we are running towards as well as what we are running from. Movements focused on abandoning centralized structures without suitable replacements tend to end in [apathetic collective action failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring), or worse, [mob rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror). If we are to avoid the proverbial guillotine, we should learn what has worked and failed in other decentralized organizations. We need to ask ourselves:\n\n> ### In what ways can decentralized organizations outcompete more centralized ones?\n\nIdeologies don’t win by claiming superiority—they win by demonstrating that they can solve real problems more effectively than the alternatives. So it’s worth deeply understanding what has actually made decentralized organizations better (and worse) than the available alternatives.\n\n## Principles of successful decentralized organizations\n\nHere are four very different kinds of organizations that have something to teach us about building DAOs:\n\n* [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/), the company behind Steam\n* the [US Marine Corps](https://www.marines.com/)\n* intentional [co-living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-living) communities\n* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)\n\nEach of these organizations operates in decentralized ways that result in better outcomes than more centralized peers. They have created flexible, adaptable, creative, and capable evolutionary systems that can outperform more rigid hierarchies in rapidly changing environments.\n\nThis wide range of organizational types shows the different ways that decentralization can manifest as a strength. By looking at the commonalities in their principles, we can understand what makes decentralized organizations successful. Here are a some of the principles they all have in common:\n\n1. Recruit the best people\n2. Help members self-organize\n3. Empower mission-driven leaders\n4. Have a bias towards action\n5. Play infinite games\n\nNote that none of these principles are about decentralization absolutism. They are about finding the right balance between decentralized self-organization and flexible leadership structures that create Schelling points for collective action. Let’s explore each one in a bit more detail.\n\n### 1 - Recruit the best people\n\nThere’s one principle that every successful organization seems to agree on: great organizations are made up of great people. No amount of organizational design can make up for people who lack the skills, ambition, and passion to accomplish great things. One of the most triumphant passages of Valve’s [employee handbook](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf) reads:\n\n> You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products. A flat structure removes every organizational barrier between your work and the customer enjoying that work.\n>\n> If you’re thinking to yourself, “Wow, that sounds like a lot of responsibility,” you’re right. And that’s why hiring is the single most important thing you will ever do at Valve. Any time you interview a potential hire, you need to ask yourself not only if they’re talented or collaborative but also if they’re capable of literally running this company, because they will be.\n\n![Diagram from the Valve employee handbook](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7s3GxOem2Zf5JQaQXyJDH.png?height=566&width=794)\n\nAs far as I can tell, “engage amazing humans” is the core strategy of all great organizations, and especially those that aspire to high levels of decentralization. Organizations are made up of people, so if you want to build great things, it’s natural that the first rule is to work with great people.\n\nWorking with great people makes your life easier. Great people are smarter and more competent than you at the things they spend time on. They see around corners you didn’t know existed. They deliver excellence in ambiguous situations without guidance. They have strong vibes and attract each other with these vibes.\n\nCompanies like Valve and Amazon, elite military units like the US Marines, and co-living environments like intentional communities all draw boundaries around themselves and carefully evaluate who they let in. By constantly attempting to raise the bar, they can keep scaling without the need for more structure and rules. From Valve again:\n\n> We believe that if we’re careful, it will work better and better the larger we get. This might seem counterintuitive, but it’s a direct consequence of hiring great, accomplished, capable people. Getting this to work right is a tricky proposition, though, and depends highly on our continued vigilance in recruiting/hiring. **If we start adding people to the company who aren’t as capable as we are at operating as high-powered, self-directed, senior decision makers, then lots of the stuff discussed in this book will stop working.**\n\nDAOs often attempt to be permissionless, allowing anyone to join the community. Maintaining openness, permeability, and an inclusive approach to newcomers allows DAOs to [grow quickly](https://creators.mirror.xyz/0OIn4KF6tGdygbA979gRxWitZ-wKuukkqzrf1Xq9xME), [increase diversity](https://creators.mirror.xyz/Y72O0H9QX0GRgy6AXrTflaGSuTQcEQ86OxZWutfp9ao), and [progressively decentralize](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/). But there’s a clear tension between bringing in the best people and maintaining an open and accessible community:\n\n![Quality of contributions, autonomy of contributors, and permeability of the organization—pick two](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eIJHAj6V7HvBNbhhSL0G-.png?height=864&width=1706)\n\nI think the best solution we have to solve for this balance is contributor proof-of-work. Proof-of-work, in this context, refers to the ability for new community members to demonstrate their capabilities and increase the scope of their work as they build trust within the community. By creating [systems for self-organizing teams to publicly accomplish the organization’s goals](https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/0xe7cc4dbdfe3c8e5ed9ef9607078d344d45a3dd65593a230916491f5f17fe7f95), DAOs can build feedback loops for strong contributors to succeed and positively reinforce the organization's culture, capabilities, and scalability.\n\n### 2 - Help members self-organize\n\nOnce you are surrounded by great people, you can work together to build systems for effective collective action. In order to self-organize, people need:\n\n1. Clearly defined missions\n2. Small groups executing at the edges\n3. Information accessibility\n4. Minimum viable self-governance\n\n**Clearly defined missions**\n\nLike a [slime mold](https://komoroske.com/slime-mold/) growing towards an available source of food or an [oak tree](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1519763362225311744) growing towards sunlight, the first thing self-organizing systems need is a goal to grow towards.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IxhN96MB5t1rponeflVj3.png?height=382&width=1242)\n\nJim Mattis, a US Marine who served as Secretary of Defense, helped define the US military’s[ counterinsurgency (COIN) doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterinsurgency). COIN is an approach to warfare designed to react to highly decentralized terrorist networks. This decentralized military doctrine considers clearly defined missions to be the most important prerequisite for allowing groups to self-organize, because no one can coordinate without a shared understanding of the goal. From Mattis’ memoir, [Call Sign Chaos](https://www.amazon.com/Call-Sign-Chaos-Learning-Lead/dp/0812996836):\n\n> The correct exercise of independent action requires a common understanding of both the mission and intent of what the mission is expected to accomplish.\n\nThis is why the most successful DAOs so far are [organized around strong memes](https://creators.mirror.xyz/5YUK1Ef3BEMA9QEZvbOIh7ukbjAYL_0cs_NLplqgHw4) that give members a shared sense of purpose and mission. At Cabin, we are experimenting with a [city council that defines objectives for each season and creates budget allocation for those objectives](https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/0xe7cc4dbdfe3c8e5ed9ef9607078d344d45a3dd65593a230916491f5f17fe7f95).\n\n**Small groups executing at the edges**\n\nOnce participants have a sense of the mission, they can get together in groups and attempt to accomplish it. Successful groups tend to be small and purposeful. More people does not usually result in better outcomes, because coordination costs increase geometrically. This coordination cost is the flip side to [Metcalfe’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b87P126tgPueOLfs9V6rO.png?height=618&width=1254)\n\nIf you [ask people what group sizes they like working with](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1510604165894094870), they will generally tell you numbers between 2 and 12 people. Amazon is well known for popularizing the term [two pizza team](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/two-pizza-teams.html) to describe this concept (though at Cabin, we prefer [one sauna teams](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1518266694736781315?s=20&t=caro5eSVCq_kRRsENnF_-Q)). DAOs can be thought of as constellations of these small teams, sometimes called pods, squads, guilds, or—if you want bad lore—subDAOs.\n\n**Information accessibility**\n\nAllowing people to self-organize into small teams requires them to have access to information and the ability to execute autonomously. Information access may be the most underestimated benefit of DAOs. Blockchains, by nature, are public ledgers. This means that DAOs, by nature, operate with high degrees of transparency about resource allocation. This is a particularly important breakthrough for DAOs because information transparency and accessibility, especially for newcomers, is a weakness of decentralized organizations like Valve:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LkaAnur3yW7lzaERR6iLU.png?height=1272&width=1756)\n\nCompanies end up developing implicit hierarchies of information availability, even if no formal hierarchies exist. Knowledge, as they say, is power. If conversations, transactions, and processes are publicly available, anyone can (at least in theory) enter the organization and contribute positively to it.\n\n**Minimum viable self-governance**\n\nAutonomy means individuals can make execution decisions without bureaucratic processes that constrain their decision-making authority. The problem with rules or processes is that they can be captured by special interests who use them to retain power instead of for the common good. An example of this is the [United States House Rules and Manual](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/hman/117/04), which contains hundreds of pages of drivel like this:\n\n> A reappropriation of unexpended balances of appropriations may not be reported in a general appropriation bill, and may not be in order as an amendment thereto…\n\nRules beget more rules, followed by processes to make sure rules are followed. Rules that determine available actions are inherently political tools. Before long, the meta-game of rule making becomes the primary force for executing the will of power, regardless of how useful the outcomes of this process are. This was one of the primary fears of the US founding fathers in designing a system of governance.\n\nBut rules exist for a reason. Resources are constrained, and if anyone can do anything with collective resources, they are quickly diminished in a [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). What is needed to solve this problem is minimum viable self-governance. Elinor Ostrom’s [design principles for common pool resource institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution) is the leading framework for how humans have solved this problem in a bottom-up way for millennia.\n\nMore recent thinking on [lorecraft](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/on-lore?s=r) is an interesting reframing of the rules problem. By focusing on memetic tools for building cultural stories, lore is a compelling alternative to rules-based systems. Telling stories about cultural norms is a [powerful narrative tool for organizing without adding process](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/lands-of-lorecraft?s=r).\n\n### 3 - Empower mission-driven leaders\n\nThere’s no such thing as a leaderless organization. When you try to build perfectly flat organizations, you just end up hiding hierarchy in illegible ways, [which seems to be an issue at Valve](https://medium.com/dunia-media/the-nightmare-of-valves-self-organizing-utopia-6d32d329ecdb). While transparent and accessible information can help combat this, the most illegible hierarchies form when groups pretend they don’t exist.\n\nWhen we say [mission-driven leaders](https://creators.mirror.xyz/BIKmTKdNiMkK1dbtUInS0zoZgVdo18i55Vh3iMU9g_I), we mean it in two ways. First, it means that the best leaders are missionaries, not mercenaries. They believe in and are dedicated to the greater mission of the organization. Second, it means that leadership is a temporary, transient role designed to solve for a specific mission.\n\nDAOs offer a unique solution to this problem that hasn’t been technically feasible before: put direct executive power in the hands of all individuals in an organization. In his [anti-capture framework](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ), Spencer Graham identifies direct executive power as the key to successful decentralized organizations:\n\n> Separation between decision-making and executive power is uniquely possible within capture-resistant structures. It is why decentralized decision-making is not a strict requirement. It is also why decentralized organizations can be fluid and adaptable. When executive power is decentralized, leadership can truly emerge from anywhere.\n\nHumans want and need leaders to create shelling points for collective action. DAOs should be *leaderful* organizations — groups that support just-in-time leadership from a wide range of capable individuals. A leader is whoever knows what to do next. Effective DAOs give members the tools to execute when they are the best leader for a shared cause.\n\nWhile Amazon is well known for their use of two-pizza teams, what’s less well known is that this type of leadership––known internally as [single threaded owners](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/two-pizza-teams-are-just-the-start-accountability-and-empowerment-are-key-to-high-performing-agile-organizations-part-2/)––is considered even more important for team cohesion and success. This type of fluid leadership only works if people within the organization have a strong bias towards action. The organization must be designed to support people taking the initiative to step into self-defined leadership roles and making things happen.\n\n### 4 - Have a bias towards action\n\nThe CIA wrote a fascinating manual called the [Simple Sabotage Field Manual](https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=750070). In addition to detailed tips and tricks for starting fires, targeting warehouses, destroying tools, and clogging toilets, the manual includes an entire section on undermining the work of organizations. The manual describes the failure state of organizations that have unclear leadership and a lack of bias towards action:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5y4185aUkjJVcaKg_f659.png?height=1372&width=1238)\n\nAnyone who has ever been in an organization attempting too much flatness and consensus has probably experienced these problems. This was the downfall of intentional living communes of the 60s and larger experiments in communism through the 1990s. When everyone has an equal voice in everything all of the time, groups end up talking a lot and accomplishing nothing.\n\nOne antidote to this problem comes from co-living communities, which are often organized around a principle called [do-ocracy](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/DoOcracy). This principle states that, generally, whoever actually does the thing makes the rules. Phil Levin, one of Cabin’s city council members and founder of several successful co-living communities, put together a fantastic presentation called *[What DAOs can learn from co-living communities](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_fgNg-rXrk3Q-18Tvmnj2VV6D8qcSIfHiFrlyoo6_Yw/edit#slide=id.ga247f2dd33_0_145)*. The communities Phil has started thrive on the principle of self-appointed do-ocratic leadership:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WpoVncZ1IE-UyYgUdCbfC.png?height=694&width=1246)\n\nThe goal is to minimize governance and consensus decision-making by empowering individuals to make autonomous actions as long as they are reversible and inexpensive. Another good example of this type of decentralized leadership comes from Cabin’s Build Weeks.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DuIW7EKJVpPBnfrM1sM5J.png?height=1944&width=2758)\n\n[Build Weeks are self-organized](https://creators.mirror.xyz/Oe86T6-4COpnuw5QV09G_82jdshQaRn4z-Rz9k_cfx8) by a primary build leader, and also support room for other builders to go on do-ocratic side quests that contribute to the built environment of Cabin’s Neighborhood Zero. Here’s how participants in a recent Build Week described effective do-ocracy:\n\n> Despite a lack of stringent roles and duties, everything got done, we were able to use our unique skills and interests without any conflict, and most importantly, everyone got to drive the skidsteer.\n\nValve also emphasizes a do-ocratic approach to product development, where anyone can “come up with a bright idea, tell a coworker about it, work on it together, and ship it”:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1ctftuqBgcObZl_EP5vrh.png?height=1106&width=1036)\n\nTo make this work, you need to design your organizational processes to explicitly reward people trying new things. As Jim Mattis explains:\n\n> Instillation of personal initiative and risk taking doesn't spring forward spontaneously. It must be cultivated and rewarded in an organization's culture \\[…\\] Be tolerant of mistakes. If risk takers are punished, then you will retain only the risk averse.\n\nWhen things don’t go well, ask yourself: is it because someone took strong initiative and the experiment failed, or because they failed to take the initiative in the first place?\n\n### 5 - Play infinite games\n\nRewarding leaders with a bias towards action is key to successfully executing as a decentralized organization. But execution is a finite game—a convergent action to accomplish a specific goal. The final principle of effective decentralized organizations is inherently divergent: play [infinite games](https://www.amazon.com/Finite-Infinite-Games-James-Carse/dp/1476731713).\n\nVibes, reciprocity, and trust are infinite games. They are not played to win, but to keep playing. Infinite games are played for intrinsic rewards:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vRRn1wUriscP1h1DCxp1p.png?height=698&width=1244)\n\nThe co-living communities Phil has helped start revolve around the principle of intrinsic rewards. Phil’s partner Kristen, a behavioral scientist, knew that intrinsic rewards are a much more powerful and fulfilling form of motivation than extrinsic ones. As a result, their co-living communities do not offer direct compensation for essentially any work within the community. This policy has ultimately made the community stronger and more productive than if everyone played finite games of resource allocation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9XbA1L4MzYhgYiLT1viOb.png?height=672&width=1244)\n\nIntrinsic community building means valuing community members beyond the work they do for the organization and allowing people to contribute to the community without expecting extrinsic rewards. While the work of a DAO should reward excellent executors with increased responsibility and financial upside, the whole community does not need to be held to the same standard because the motivations for participation are different. Communities are about vibes and relationships — both of which are driven by intrinsic motivation and infinite games.\n\nInfinite games will take DAOs to interesting places. Amazon is playing an infinite game. Notice what’s missing from Amazon’s famous flywheel—any arrows leaving the diagram:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cTlIsRyuq1W3X9aIfXn2S.png?height=860&width=1166)\n\nAmazon is one of the world’s most powerful self-perpetuating economic feedback loops. It is a mechanism for feeding back on its own growth, which creates exponential growth in revenue without capturing profits:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5YxIY8ce-E5-0q0BEuhrK.png?height=700&width=1246)\n\nThe most potent DAOs will follow a similar path—they will create intrinsically motivated [communities that self-perpetuate memes and culture](https://creators.mirror.xyz/5YUK1Ef3BEMA9QEZvbOIh7ukbjAYL_0cs_NLplqgHw4) while simultaneously developing protocol [hyperstructures](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) that live indefinitely and create value without necessarily extracting profits.\n\nThis is the end state of sufficiently decentralized organizations that points us towards a future that companies are not designed to produce. Organizations of the future can be collectively owned and organized around a token that provides utility to those who hold or stake it and that never attempts to produce dividends or profits that are extracted from the system—all while still providing massive value to network participants. Like ecosystems, economies, and other forms of complex adaptive systems, DAOs can be structures for playing infinite self–fulfilling games that reward participants with meaning and purpose.\n\n## The DAO playbook\n\nNo two DAOs will be able to follow the exact same playbook, because their purposes, communities, and resources will look different. But, like companies, a diversity of products, business models, and cultures will develop in DAOs—and there will be repeatable patterns of success in the ways organizations treat DAO as a verb.\n\nUltimately, by integrating the ways that [centralized hierarchies create efficiency and decentralized networks create resilience](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/unisNGUtHyRF7Zcp9CBbC-VhICOvVm0uzTFJUPX-Icg), we can chart a path towards more effective organizations. Charting this path will require a deep understanding of historical precedent and a penchant for constant experimentation. No matter what these organizations of the future end up looking like, the ones that succeed will probably do these things:\n\n1. Recruit the best people\n2. Help members self-organize\n3. Empower mission-driven leaders\n4. Have a bias towards action\n5. Play infinite games\n\n\n---\n\n*thanks to Phil Levin, Zakk Fleischmann, Chase Chapman, Commodore, Erik Trautman, Allen Taylor, Spencer Graham, and Rafa Fernandez for ideas and edits reflected in this essay*", "timestamp": 1654533076, "digest": "mPl6XzbpINulirbnh4z0VhdpRTi6mYjHnKqwOZ8uZCI", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

It's not popular now", "body": "In the past two days, there was a passage from Jiang Xun that I had always liked. Copy it in a small notebook.\n\"All aesthetics of life aims to resist the word busy. Busy is the death of the soul. Don't be busy any more - you will begin to have aesthetics of life.\"\nAt the end of the year when everyone was complaining about being busy and tired, I couldn't help typing out the following.\nEveryone is busy, \"busy\" seems to have become a synonym for \"meaning\". If I am very free today, and Wang Laosan sends out the words \"I can only sleep four hours a day until midnight\" in his circle of friends, then I seem to be far behind him.\nIf other people get up early to catch a plane, don't sleep at night, and get to know friends and expand contacts while drinking and preparing, but I just drink tea and read books at home, will I be degenerated. This is the inner problem of many people.\nUnknowingly, he threw away his comfortable lifestyle and held his glasses everywhere to find another lifestyle.\nTo tell the truth, there are many desperate Saburo and Sanniang in my vision. I admit that their enthusiasm for struggle has played a lot of free chicken blood for me. They are desperate. Their eyes are bright. Any \"state\" is already the best inspirational chicken soup.\nBut I'm sorry, I'm getting more and more tired of this kind of behavior. If you really enjoy working overtime, really indulge in regular fever and headache, and really immerse in the superiority of \"no time\", then I can only say: you are sick.\nThe pursuit of most normal people is spiritual relaxation and happiness. At least it must not be fatigue like a dog sticking out its tongue. But is it too unsightly for someone to whitewash his rough life with the word \"hard force\" every day?\nThe poison radiation of contemporary success studies is too wide. One of them is that it makes many people feel that a successful person is a busy person who has no time. Therefore, if I am busy every day, I am about equal to a successful person.\nDon't deceive yourself. The above assumption may also be equivalent to \"you are stupid and inefficient; or most of the decisions you make are wrong, and you can only continue to remedy & detours.\"\nCompared with those who work hard in the noise every day and beat themselves like a top, I now appreciate those who live with great relaxation and ease. For example, some friends will fly to Europe for a month after a month of intensive work; Or push off several shiny \"small opportunities\" and stay at home for days without washing your face or socializing;\nI have a very good friend who works in the CCTV news channel. She wishes she could work overtime every day without holidays. But one day, she exposed a beautiful oil painting in her circle of friends. She said that she had signed up for a weekend oil painting class to learn. I loved her very much at once. Like me, she especially disliked the seemingly \"tall\" situation of deliberately making friends. No matter how good the opportunity was, she wouldn't go to the people and adjustments she didn't like;\nAnd my special friend yangshanshan, whose life is also very enjoyable. In the model circle, he has never been affected by flashy habits, never tried hard to gather resources and create popularity, and exhausted himself. She once told me that people can decide what they see and hear. I choose not to touch some things because I think I may be adversely affected.\nPeople devote themselves to their own clothing design, like retro style to immerse in the end. The attitude towards life is really to let things be as they are. It is very natural and unrestrained. If you have the opportunity to travel and see the world, you can still do a small business. A few days ago, I found that she had taken her new clothes to Paris for shooting while playing.\nDidn't they work hard? But they don't enjoy life?\nI can never finish my work. My career can grow day by day, but is it really a good thing to continue to expand?\nI still remember when we went to Greece the year before last, the guide told us that a group of big Chinese bosses went to a local wine cellar to talk about cooperation with them. How many boxes of wine they bought every year was rejected by the owner of the wine cellar. They said that we only made so much wine every year, but we didn't do so much. If there were too many, I wouldn't have time to go to the bar to travel.\nNot only that, the cellar owner also introduced this group of big bosses who were stupid and rich to the neighboring cellar owners.\nThis is not stupid. It's just that you don't make money yourself. You also take the initiative to send money to your competitors.\nUnfortunately, this is just the Chinese way of thinking.\nNow there are too many organizations that fight chicken blood, but which one is better? Anyway, the chicken blood I want to provide you is like this: the purpose of beating chicken blood is to enjoy life, enrich life experience, chew the achievements of struggle with our family, not the pleasure of beating chicken blood itself. Beating chicken blood itself is not pleasant. If you think it is, you can only say that you are ill.\nBesides, do you really think you need so much chicken blood? Call again when necessary, and shield when not required.\nTherefore, compared with those who shout that they have no time to eat breakfast, have no time to take a nap, or have no time to take a drip when they are ill, I prefer to arrange my life leisurely. Besides work, I also develop other interesting people. Even if his productivity is not so amazing.\nIn an era of too much meaning, \"less meaning\" is a luxury. For example, having a meal with a group of friends who can't talk about cooperation, laughing and crying, is of special significance; For example, when other people watch art exhibitions and listen to concerts one after another, and the rich soul needs to be eaten alive, I will leisurely choose one I really like to see, which is of special significance;\nIn this golden age, when a woman went to practice calligraphy and learn the tea ceremony at the weekend, I felt very appreciative; You can neither take the grade examination nor realize it, just learn to play for yourself.\nFinally, don't flaunt how hard you are.

If we can make a little progress every day - even 1% progress, what can stop us from finally becoming successful?\" A little progress every day is not a big goal, nor is it difficult to achieve. Maybe yesterday's \"I\" also tried hard and achieved gratifying results, but today's I must surpass yesterday's \"I\" and make more progress and enrichment. Every day of life should be full of new things.\nA little progress every day is enough. On the road of life, a little progress every day is a steady and continuous progress. \"If you don't advance, you will fall back\". As long as you are moving forward, no matter how small your progress is, it doesn't matter, but you must move forward a little bit than yesterday. Life must also continue to make small efforts every day in order to achieve something.\nAs long as we make a little progress every day, we will make a little progress 365 times a year. If we continue to do so, any gap in our lives may be hundreds of thousands of miles in a few years. A little bit every day is what we need to learn and what we need to do all our lives. Everyone is ordinary by nature. Don't imagine that you will suddenly be reborn and become a genius. You know, from ordinary to excellent to excellent, all you need to do is make a little progress every day.\nIn the 1985 American Professional Basketball League, the Los Angeles Lakers won the championship with their players' top skills. But in the final, he unexpectedly lost to Boston's Celtics, which made coach Patrick Reilly and all the players extremely frustrated.\nPetrelli is a coach hired by the Lakers with an annual salary of $1.2 million. He will never let himself and his players stagnate in frustration. In order to restore the confidence of the players, he told everyone: \"from today on, can we make a little progress in free throws, passing, steals, rebounds, long shots, and every aspect?\" The player granted his request without hesitation. In the next year's training, the players always keep the spirit of \"making a little progress\" and constantly improve their skills.\nFinally, in the 1986 American Professional Basketball League, the Lakers lived up to expectations and easily won the championship. When paitrelli won the championship, he said to the players: \"our success is not accidental. Think about it, our 12 players have made 1% progress in five technical links in a year, so one player has made 5% progress, and the whole team has made 60% progress. The Lakers, who are at the peak of their skills, have increased 60% or even higher, so it is natural for us to achieve unexpected results.\"\nA little progress every day sounds like there is no spirit, no tempting fruits, no sensational momentum. But after careful consideration, it says that people should be consistent and realistic. A little progress every day is the accumulation of success from childhood to great success; A little progress every day is the accumulation of self-confidence; Making a little progress every day is dismissing failure and frustration; A little progress every day is the best way to achieve a perfect life.\nAt Harvard, students have such a consensus: every day there is a bit of progress, which can not only give full play to their internal potential, but also accumulate capital for success. Indeed, success is a little progress every day - as long as I make a little progress today than yesterday, and I can make a little progress tomorrow than today, this process is success.", "timestamp": 1654533459, "digest": "SIp4is6HAHCMj9YAGp2zC1Q4HjfjbYEzKUpyRgoqbTM", "contributor": "0x43B54b027Ad4F991dF5172f06b1363E00Cf2bc97"}

{"id": "T9uaZ-gAN5fR5Rmut83QZhehLREdChs2Fqlm67zON3U", "title": "We can't be good people, but we can be better ourselves", "body": "I used to think that actors are a magical species. They are naturally versatile. A person who can act seems to be able to sing, dance, folk art, sketches, musical instruments, crosstalk, and all 18 kinds of martial arts. He can stand still under any kind of spotlight.\nIt was not until I heard wangluodan talk about his experience of learning dance that I found that, except for those \"other people's children\" who were born to be angry with us, in fact, there are more \"stupid people\" who lack talent in all walks of life.\nShe said, \"I stood in the middle of the dance room for the first time when I was 6 years old. My mother walked me through the door and gave me a hard look. The information was huge, including - my child, I was numbed by your wild behavior from childhood to childhood, but I will soon go to primary school. I hope you will make your last attempt to be a good girl who knows how to dance and stick. My mother loves you. If you don't dance well, you will eat vegetarian vegetables with your father tonight and watch the new dance Go to bed after listening to the broadcast. Do you understand? \"\n\"I understand, so my steps are very heavy. The teacher taught us to turn horizontally, and all the children can rotate according to the track. Only I can turn like a headless fly. There were about a dozen students in the classroom. They laughed and bent over. This' laughter 'suddenly shattered my fantasy of talent. Therefore, from the age of 6, I knew that once I danced, I would hear laughter like applause. At that time, I gave up learning to dance.\"\nI asked her, \"when you were admitted to the Beijing Film Academy, didn't you want to show your art exam?\"\nShe was a little proud. \"I was admitted to the Beijing Film Academy at the age of 17. During the art examination, most of the female students did choose dance, ballet, ethnic, classical, even jazz and hip-hop. I was the only one who sang a rock song paranoia. At that time, I thought I was cool. Later, in the school's presentation performance, the student sister danced a duet\" cradle on the stage, and my admiration ran through the whole adolescence. \"\nHer words reminded me of those students who achieved particularly good math scores in my high school days. They also admired them and became the most profound brand in my youth. Maybe everyone has an example at the bottom of their heart, who used to be the one we all want to be in our dreams.\nI was curious, \"you should be able to choose your favorite life and role now. It doesn't matter whether you can dance or not?\"\nShe laughed, \"I couldn't overcome my desire for dancing. Although I didn't have talent, I went to the dance rehearsal hall and tried again. Ha ha, I still couldn't do it. It was more difficult than I thought. I insisted on dancing for a month, but the movements were still not standard, the coordination was poor, and I often couldn't keep up with the rhythm. I confirmed that I would never have a chance to meet the standards of professional dancers. However, I laughed with my teammates and showed in the dance group. This was the greatest happiness.\"\n\"I really don't have talent, but I can be better. I am such a stupid and hard-working self. Even, everyone can't be an excellent person, but can be a better self.\"\nThe last sentence really poked me.\nOur current popular culture is particularly intolerant of \"stupid self\" and \"excellent others\", especially those who live a less outstanding and happy life. Since ancient times, our aesthetic orientation has always been: \"where there is a will, there is a way to accomplish things. When there is a will, there will be a way to sink the boat. Twelve hundred Qinchuan will eventually belong to Chu. The painstaking efforts of the people and the heaven will live up to their expectations. They will endure hardships and taste the gall. Three thousand Yuejia can swallow Wu.\"\nIn our philosophy of existence, there are too many strong people thinking. Even in the thinking mode of success, the meaning of the word \"effort\" has been misinterpreted - effort does not mean doing your best, but rather surpassing others, becoming the best strong person in a certain field, and comparing others.\nTherefore, we believe in \"not making excuses for failure, but finding methods for success\", \"there is nothing that cannot be done, only those who can not be done\", and our \"efforts\" are too strong to win or lose.\nHowever, not everyone's ideal is to become an outstanding person, and not everyone has the opportunity to become a strong person - genius and excellent guys are always the limited edition of life. Most of the time, we can only make \"Einstein's third bench\" - that although ugly, it is better than the first two. This wise man with the largest brain capacity also has no all-round talent. He still has a weakness, and his loveliness is not that he has worked hard to make up for his weaknesses and live a painless life, but that he still maintains his childishness and wants to make a little better looking bench, which is better than the first two.\nThis is the true meaning of efforts.\nEven the most inconspicuous morning glory has its own unique beauty when it opens. It will never become a popular peony, but it still enjoys the process of blooming.\nNot everyone's dream is to live in a big house, earn a lot of money and stand out. Many people are enjoying their own little happiness and calmly become happy ordinary people.\nThose who try their best but don't shine, and those who work hard but don't succeed, still deserve applause.\nA horse named \"Chunli\", which has never won, is a Japanese idol.\nChunli has lost every battle since she made her debut at Kochi Racecourse in November, 1998. For six years, Chunli has been running hard, but has never won the first. At the end of 2003, after Chunli set a record of 100 consecutive defeats, NHK TV broadcast an album of \"losing superstar\" on the evening news, and Chunli instantly became a well-known star.\nIn order to give Chunli a taste of winning the championship, on march22,2004, Wufeng, the most popular knight in Japan, served as Chunli's rider. On that day, the audience had to queue up for two hours to enter the arena, buy horse tickets and various souvenirs. Even the prime minister was paying attention to the results of the horse race.\nThere was no miracle. Chunli still ranked No. 10 among the 11 horses. This was her 106th failure, but it did not hurt the enthusiasm of the audience. Many people also proposed to help Chunli make a film and let her be the \"heroine\" again.\nWhy is a losing horse so obsessed?\nPerhaps many people have seen the epitome of their own life from her - although they have failed all the time, they are still running. \"Win\" is a skill. Knowing that \"win\" can not be won, they are willing not to give up and strive for better results for themselves. It is open-minded, and it is the real meaning of the word \"effort\".\nJust like each of us, we can't be excellent others, but we can be better ourselves.", "timestamp": 1654533576, "digest": "tqhflpOTxe6ysDN76jzAeyj78MA4JyMRE7HeOlEF-zU", "contributor": "0x1EcA182Df5Ab60b2905641d159a4882C5F3a3E69"}

It's really an ability to express ideas accurately in words\n   Indeed, most of us lack this skill, but it is extremely important.\n   Expressing your ideas accurately in words can help you build relationships and impress others. Learn this skill well so that you can freely exchange ideas with others.\n   The key to training your expression skills is to speak bravely.\n   You can try to talk to strangers, chat up with train neighbors, and contact your first love that you haven't seen for a long time. A few words with people you need to summon up courage to talk to can force you to express your thoughts clearly.\n2. Ability to get along with oneself\n   Being alone is an ability.\n   A person can also be very happy. If you master this skill, no one can take away your happiness. Be your own best friend, enjoy your company, and enjoy a person's happy time.\n   If you have this skill, you will begin to appreciate the people and everything around you.\n3. Breaking away from herding and not following others is also ability\n   Someone once did an experiment in which a fence was placed in front of a group of sheep. After the leading sheep jumped over the fence, the sheep behind them would jump one by one.\n   That seems reasonable, doesn't it.\n   But when the fence was suddenly removed, the sheep behind continued to jump, as if the fence still existed.\n   And humans are no smarter than sheep. We also have this \"herd effect\": we often learn things quickly, but sometimes we learn a lot of things wrong.\n   Unfortunately, most of us are like sheep that continue to jump.\n   Learning not to imitate others' sheep may be the most important lesson of our life.\n4. Ability to recover quickly\n   The ability of rapid recovery, specific to life, is the toughness of life.\n   You should try to cultivate the ability to stand up again and again from failure, and never give up and set sail again even though you have failed in experiments again and again.\n5. Ability to learn to let go\n   Some things are really not tailor-made for you, and you may not get them no matter how hard you try. Sometimes you need to change your goals and plans.\n   To learn the ability to let go, you can start with the following:\n   Give up all material greed\n   Throw away or donate all the clothes you don't wear\n   Stop waiting for comments and likes from your circle of friends\n   Stop hating that girl you've been dead set on\n   ……\n   Learning to let go is a sign of maturity. Although it is not easy, it is very important.\n6. Ability to tell stories\n   Many people let us remember for a long time because they know how to tell a good story.\n   You will meet countless people in the decades of your life, and you will forget most of them, but you will remember those who can tell stories.\n7. Ability to be \"different\"\n   Another important skill for people is to know how to make a difference.\n   You need to find a field where you can do better than everyone, and be a person who can create value for others. (even if your skills are small)\n8. Self discipline\n   Finally, what you need is the ability of self-discipline. Because it is the premise for you to realize almost any other dream.\n   Self discipline means letting your thoughts determine your behavior, not your emotions.\n   Even after the initial enthusiasm fades, continue to complete an idea or project, and say \"no\" in the face of temptation.\n   If you are struggling with self-discipline, the good news is that it will certainly help you.", "timestamp": 1654533676, "digest": "hk2FLP5O2wO-CHSisqVXxs18wRA6uzLM7C3aWGw7qR8", "contributor": "0x309ce12CF52101dA5Dc7f117f5Fd6C04B0C1C21b"}

Contacts refer to people who are good at using and managing contacts. According to a survey report of Stanford Research Center, 12.5% of people want to make money from knowledge and 87.5% from contacts. So some people say that contacts are wealth, and relationships are strength. This sentence is not without reason.\nThree monks met in the broken temple. \"Why is this temple deserted?\" I wonder who raised the question.\n\"The monk must be ungodly, so the Bodhisattva doesn't work.\" Monk Jia said.\n\"It must be that the monks are not diligent, so the temple is not built.\" Said monk B.\n\"The monks must be disrespectful, so there are not many pilgrims.\" Monk C said.\nThe three argued and finally decided to stay and do their best. So monk a worshiped the Buddha and chanted scriptures, monk B tidied up the temple affairs, and monk C prayed in all directions. After such a period of time, the incense became more and more popular, and the old temple changed its appearance.\nTherefore, monk Jia said, \"all because of my devotion to Buddha, the Bodhisattva shows his spirit.\" Monk B said, \"because I am diligent in management, the temple has comprehensive affairs.\" Monk Bing said, \"because I persuade the world to run, so there are many pilgrims.\" The three people argued day and night, and the grand occasion in the temple gradually disappeared. On the day when they went north and south, they finally came to the same conclusion: the desolation of the temple was neither ungodly nor diligent, nor disrespectful, but the monks were unhappy!\nHamill company attaches great importance to interview results when recruiting new employees. In fact, the interview questions are not difficult, but few people can pass.\nOn july13,2003, the company conducted another unique interview. The examiner put a thick stack of documents and a folder on each person's desk and said to the interviewer, \"please use the folder on the desk to put the folder in place within 5 minutes.\"\nThis is simply too easy. Everyone thinks so. As soon as the examiner's official voice fell, the interviewers could not wait to pick up the folder with their hands and try to put these folders together as soon as possible. What they didn't expect happened. The clip is big and hard. One hand can't open it. If you press it with two hands, you can't hold the document.\nOne minute has passed, two minutes have passed, and the happiness has long disappeared. The interviewers began to be restless, and some even gave up their efforts in advance. Five minutes later, the examiner announced the interview results, and only four interviewers passed the interview. It turned out that during the interview, the four of them were quickly divided into two groups. In each group, one person arranged the documents neatly on the table, and then held the two corners of one end of the document tightly with two hands, while the other person pressed the clip open with two hands, and then clamped the document. In less than a minute, four thick documents were neatly clamped.\nThis interview, in fact, examines the ability to unite and help each other.\nEdison was a great inventor. He had more than 2000 inventions in his life, with an average of 13 days. So many inventions are incredible for one's limited energy and life. But Edison turned it into reality. The secret lies in the fact that Edison's laboratory has three right-hand assistants: the first is American Ott, who has unique expertise in machinery, surpassing Edison; The second was the Englishman bechler, who was silent and good at studying. He often asked some strange questions, which greatly inspired Edison; The third is the Swiss Cruz. He is good at drawing. No matter how rough Edison's manuscript is, he can make formal mechanical drawings. In addition, there were several hard-working people who worked as his assistants. It can be seen that three gangs for a hero, three stakes for a fence and green leaves for a red flower are universally applicable to all walks of life at all times and in all countries.\nThe same is true of man and nature. There is a plant called Sequoia in California, the United States. Its height is about 90 meters, equivalent to more than 30 floors. Generally speaking, the law of nature is \"deep roots and luxuriant leaves\". The taller the plant is, the deeper its roots should be. But scientists have found that the roots of Sequoia are just floating on the ground.\nTheoretically, plants that do not have deep roots are very fragile. As long as a gust of wind can uproot them, how can Sequoia grow so tall and stand still? After further study, it is found that the growth of Sequoia must be a large Sequoia forest, and there is no independent Sequoia. This piece of Sequoia is closely connected with each other's roots, one by one, forming a large area. No matter how big a hurricane is in nature, it can not shake thousands of Sequoia forests whose roots are closely connected and cover an area of more than 1000 hectares.\nThe vigorous growth of Sequoia has given us great enlightenment: the success of our career comes from mutual help. Just like the roots of Sequoia are connected, with full and close cooperation, it creates a great cause that can not stand down.\nDon't take yourself too seriously. One of the most important aspects to improve interpersonal relations is: be modest, keep a low profile, don't be arrogant and domineering, take others more seriously than yourself, take friends more seriously than yourself, and keep others in mind.", "timestamp": 1654533741, "digest": "onCVWLiadmsShw0xEA07tLj2gjzvmVTYealS78dYvQA", "contributor": "0xDd99eC19EC0fc81f732c7179C992678295504f64"}

{"id": "N-5AA443xdJ0SOEX2pdEC8SYc0Tluuoge3DypOBzsT4", "title": "Tell you why you can't make money", "body": "I never hate money. I believe you don't either. Then we will have a common language. There are three things I like to do every day:\nIt doesn't matter how much you read or how little you read. The key is to turn two pages when you have nothing to do, which means you haven't become a worldly person.\nExercise, I think the best rest is exercise, which can stimulate people's passion. Sweating in front of the mirror, I immediately have confidence in life.\nMake money, give full play to your talent, do what you like to do, and make money by the way. Buy a bag when your wife is happy. Er - making money is divided into making money with ability, making money with relationships, making money with money, making money with others, making money with resources, and making money with looks... I really want to do this later.\nWell, get down to business.\nI think it is possible for a person to reach a level in his life. This level is to make money by doing everything and make money by not doing anything. As long as I want to make money, I can make money at any time. For example, I can make money by giving lectures, publishing books, writing columns, planning creativity, making money by doing talk shows, making money by doing stocks and fund management, and making money by flattering my wife. Er... In short, I can make money by doing many things. Although I won't be rich, I don't seem to lack money.\nThis is not true. The story club sent me a private letter on the microblog, saying: Sir, we picked up a microblog from you. Can you express the 50 yuan contribution fee to you. Er, how generous... I often receive such huge sums of money. Of course, I usually refuse them. Duang - the reply is: donate it for me - do you think brother is a good man?\nBut I also have many friends who have been poor all their lives and can not reach this stage. They have been forced to work hard and exhaust their lives in front of the computer. In the end, they fell down with cervical spondylosis and dare not leave their jobs. They also dare not change their jobs, because they have to change their mortgage, pay their children's tuition, pay their utilities, and pay their credit cards... They can only sit on the roof of the building one evening at sunset, smoke a cigarette, and sigh, This is the fucking life. Then I came back to wash and sleep. The next day, I continued to reincarnate.\nI think about it. The reasons why a person does not realize financial freedom in the end are as follows:\n\n1. Fail to develop their own core and unique abilities before the age of 35\n   This ability must not be easily replaced by others. Only in this way can you be valuable. Isn't there a saying:\n   Don't deliberately integrate into any circle. When your energy reaches a certain level, the corresponding circle will automatically absorb you.\n   Some people will feel that they know a lot of people, especially those who are awesome. They feel that their whole life is floating. They feel that they have a part of you in their life. They even feel that everyone is on an equal footing. In fact, this kind of thing, if you are not a bully yourself, no matter how you flatter and approach those bullys, it is just a foil. You are a real bull. If you are strong, you are really strong.\n   Therefore, a long-term relationship must be that you have the ability in a certain aspect, that is, you have value. No matter how you change jobs before the age of 35, you must remember to cultivate your core competitiveness in a certain aspect.\n2. No good popularity\n   It's hard for me to succeed without help these days. For example, you can go to the stock market. Speaking of this sad thing, I have also started to speculate in the stock market recently. Countless friends have come to me to give me news. In China, I think that it depends on news, luck and technology.\n   Whether the news is accurate or not, people really want to make money. Good contacts are the kind of people who are happy when they see you.\n   As for some people, they just think about themselves and think that others should help themselves and seek benefits for themselves. Are you handsome or are your ancestral graves smoking? Why should people help you, especially when it comes to making money? If it weren't for your close friends, who would make you rich. So if you have nothing to do, should you like it more in your circle of friends?\n   A friend of mine takes out one hour each morning and afternoon to comment on the circle of friends, and likes those who don't have comments. He said that only in this way will his friends remember him. Even those who are not familiar with him will remember him because he often appears. So his girlfriend came here with praise, his work came here with praise, and he borrowed the money he bought the house with praise. He said that the progress of human history cannot be separated from praise.\n   Therefore, we should accumulate more friends at ordinary times. Don't wait to use others before thinking of being good to others. Don't you know that interpersonal relationship is like a potted flower. If you don't cultivate it carefully, it will wither. How to water and fertilize? Make a phone call to ask for help, invite guests to dinner and don't forget to snack. Give him the good-looking microblog Aite... Be kind to others, and they will always miss you.\n   You don't plant flowers to pick them, but when they bloom, you can naturally smell the fragrance.\n3. Don't think independently, don't delve into the logic behind it\n   Just follow the trend. News is very important, luck is very important, and finally there is a technology, isn't there?\n   The master leads you in. Your integrity depends on yourself. I always think I'm not a smart person, but I just like to think about it. It's a very smooth word. For example, I have been speculating in stocks recently. I use a notebook every day to write down today's operation reflection, such as why the stock was bought less, why the stock was sold early, why the management wanted to reduce its holdings, what the various fluctuations of the K-line chart imply... I take a notebook and write it down. If one day I succeed and the reporter interviews me, I can also turn over the notebook and tell him whether my road to success is not?\n   In this era, there are many smart people, but few people are willing to think hard.\n   Therefore, if you want to enter any discipline and master any kind of knowledge, you must work hard. If you want to master it, you must first love it.\n   With these three guarantees, I think you can also achieve financial freedom. Forget it. My wife said that if I dragged the floor, I would be given 100 yuan to make money. It's so free.", "timestamp": 1654533827, "digest": "eT9ukrJw7lSKxBkC_MPg-kx9rL4vzSVfp78qF4VTwkQ", "contributor": "0x78bEfa7dDB3D63c4414088d5c83968F96724B1Be"}
{"id": "EHWggmS-IYjkMCzqIkkdeMBzCoG7TGRwlwcegrNndz4", "title": "Do you think you work hard enough?", "body": "Even if life is a long-distance race, it is only a long-distance race without rivals. If there are rivals, it is only you. In this process, you only need to pay attention to your progress. How much you pay, how much you get. Try your best to do well in your hands. When you are tired and tired and want to be lazy, warn yourself: you think you are working hard, but you don't even see the edge of your efforts.\n\n1. Even if life is a long-distance race, you only need to pay attention to your progress\n   In the past, people used to say that life is a long-distance race, not winning or losing at any moment. A long time ago, I thought this view was quite objective. Yes, there are so many opponents. It is not necessarily who is ahead of you at any time. The one who wins at the end is the one who wins.\n   Now I think this sentence also has a big problem.\n   Although the process of life is full of competition, its purpose is definitely not competition. We study hard, work hard, and constantly enrich and improve ourselves. Our ultimate goal should not be to surpass others, but to meet our own requirements for self realization. If you like to do this job and are willing to do it, you should spend more time and energy. How much you spend is worth it, and how much you gain in the end. You have a balance in your heart; You don't like it so much. Consider its importance, invest the corresponding energy and time, and finally achieve many results, which is also due to cause and effect. There is no need to compare it with others.\n   People have their own advantages and disadvantages. You don't have to feel complacent because you are half better than others in that matter, and you don't have to be ashamed because you are half worse than others in something. Just take care of yourself. People's energy is so limited and their talents are so different that it is difficult to give up the details and grasp the key points; If you can get rid of the competitive mentality, it is valuable to calmly use your talent and corresponding diligence to deal with it.\n   Most of the time, people complain because they don't understand what they want or don't want. Even if life is a long-distance race, it is only a long-distance race without rivals. If there are rivals, it is only you. In this process, you only need to pay attention to your progress.\n   2、no pay, no gain\n   In my not too long life experience at present, many ordinary people in Contemporary Chinese society pursue \"shortcuts\", which is really difficult for me to agree with.\n   From those who evade tickets and jump in the queue, to those who are unwilling to get up early to register and find it difficult to get a hospital number, from those who are always cramming for the exam, to those who are looking forward to picking up leaks in the antique market, all these are simply small and broad, or even unearned.\n   In any case I can imagine, the hard work cost we pay is closely related to the substantial benefits we get (note that I am talking about substantial benefits, not counting the kind of threatening our tutors to commit suicide and finally get a degree). There may be differences in the proportion of the two, but this is more because we are at different levels of the interest chain. When we are still at a very low level, we begin to fantasize about paying very little cost to obtain great benefits. This is really a very absurd thing.\n   At the age of twelve, I hoped to find a job that would enable me to earn enough money to spend before I was thirty, then retire at thirty, and spend money every day after that. After a few years of high school, I realized how stupid this wish is. Up to now, I think it's a very happy thing to find a job I like and devote all my efforts to it until one of me and the other no longer need the other. The necessary money and reputation in exchange are just accessories. In most cases, these things can't be balanced with your interests and time. On the other hand, a child wants to find a job that is easy, profitable, respected and likes, and then relax for a lifetime. This is also very bullshit.\n   It's very simple. How much you pay, how much you get. The irrefutable truth, at least in my case.\n2. Group and self identification\n   I would also like to say that my middle school is a middle school in Shaanxi Province. Every year, the number of students attending Tsinghua and Peking University is the largest, and a champion pops up from time to time. When I was in middle school, I often felt inflated because of this kind of data. I felt that I was a member of this school, so I was very good. Looking at other school students, I felt that I was superior.\n   When I went to college, I immediately realized that my middle school state was like a clown.\n   I must admit that there are advantages and disadvantages between a group and a group, but it is the individual that determines the advantages and disadvantages of a group. The reason why a university is outstanding is that there are masters or once were masters. If a famous university is no longer a master or a leader for one generation or even several generations, the so-called famous brand has become stronger than the outside and stronger than the inside. It is even used by future generations as a capital to show off and flaunt.\n   We are always used to marking ourselves with the relatively excellent group we belong to, as if it is some kind of identity. From middle school to university to work, it seems that with the identity of this group, we become very safe and have quality assurance. It seems that as long as this group goes out, I must be highly qualified and proficient in business. In fact, cause and effect are reversed. You were able to join this group at first because you worked hard and improved. You can only jump into a relatively excellent group at the time of stage change. If you indulge after coming in, you will start to be decadent. Even if you are labeled as a defective product.\n   I respect the people who have always worked hard. I think these people don't care what labels they are labeled, but only their own efforts. As long as we don't stop, we will continue to grow and strengthen ourselves. If one day, the current group can no longer accommodate themselves and can no longer provide a broad enough stage for themselves, it doesn't matter. They will enter a new and better group.\n   These people do not value the identification of the group, but only need to identify with their own efforts.\n3. No one is a loser, just be an elite\n   At the very beginning, like many eight-year students of Peking Union Medical College, I didn't like the idea that we should be trained into elites in the school training plan. I felt that it was too inconsistent with the actual teaching situation. Moreover, in a place that advocates the golden mean, China, it was easy to cry out that elites would be hated and attacked by others, and the gun would shoot the first bird. For a long time, I thought so. But until the recent emergence of loser culture, more and more people began to argue that they are losers. I think it is necessary to mention the word \"elite\".\n   A person, no matter how smart he is, as long as he is down-to-earth and hard enough to do his own work to the extreme, in my opinion, he is an elite. The Ramen master and the old man making steamed buns in China on the tip of the tongue are elites who love their work and do their best seriously. In this sense, no one should be a loser. Maybe you will say that this is a joke, and you still have to work hard. I hope so, too. What I am afraid of is that people influence each other. You say you are a loser, he says you are incompetent, and I say you are two. In the end, it is all about finding reasons for laziness and foolishness. It seems that it is reasonable to be depressed because of some inherent shortcomings.\n   This is really bullshit. Dare to shout, is it difficult for me to do the best I can? Do you think it's fake?\n   I won't. I just want to do my best to do what I do.

But not making any choice is just standing still. It is also a choice, and you can choose not to do this to yourself.\nMost people always think that not making choices means not making any choices, but in fact, \"not making choices\" is also a kind of choices, but you just choose not to act.\n\"Opportunities are always available, but without strength, opportunities are not yours.\"\nNo one has the responsibility to give you opportunities unless you strive for them. In other words, opportunities are won, not waiting.\nDon't complain about why no one gives you a chance. Instead, ask yourself whether you have enough ability. When the opportunity comes, whether you have enough ability to firmly grasp it.\nPeople will always encounter several great opportunities in their life. Don't worry about why the opportunity hasn't come yet. On the contrary, you should worry about whether you have the ability to firmly grasp it when the opportunity comes.\nWhen an opportunity comes, usually everyone will have several reactions.\n1、 Strive for\n2、 Choose not to fight\n3、 Let it be\n4、 Invisible opportunity\nUsually, when an opportunity comes, it is yours only when you strive for it. Let it be or not, the opportunity usually slips away. As long as you look around carefully, you can actually find that there are opportunities everywhere, but some people can't see it, some people ignore it, and successful people will actively strive for it.\nMost people are not actively looking for opportunities, but waiting for an opportunity.\nEven some people choose to do things that go against their true thoughts because they are afraid to live up to the expectations of others. When we choose to make a choice that meets the expectations of others, it is easy to find out later that this is not what we want.\nIn fact, it's not that we don't have a chance, but that we don't make a choice. As long as we think carefully, we will find that successful people know how to observe the changes around us, and then create opportunities for themselves according to the current situation. For example, in the current network revolution, some people choose to start a business at this time, and then succeed. Some people don't see the opportunity, or are unwilling to change and afraid to bear the consequences of failure, So it's not that I don't have a chance, but that I'm not willing to make a choice.\nWhat is more important than opportunity is what actions are you willing to take and what choices are you willing to make?\nDo you choose to study hard, even if you have to sacrifice an hour of reading every day?\nCan you choose to get up an hour earlier than others just to do a better job every day?\nCan you choose to run more customers in order to increase the company's performance?\nIt is our daily choices that make everyone different in life.\n\"A good decision does not depend on the choices you make at the moment, but on the decisions you make. Therefore, people who are not willing to be responsible can never make a good decision.\"\nEveryone should prepare himself every day, because what he does every day is preparing for the future. When a person is fully prepared, the opportunity comes. If he is not prepared, no matter what opportunity he has, it is not his.\nNo matter what you want to do, the most difficult thing is to take the first step. When you have the courage to take the first step, you will feel that there is nothing. Life is accumulated by a series of choices and decisions. Every seemingly insignificant action determines your future life.\nThere is no need to worry about life. No one gives you opportunities, because opportunities depend on your own creation. More importantly, whether you are willing to make choices or not. Life itself is constantly making choices. Even if you are not willing to make choices, it is also a choice.", "timestamp": 1654533943, "digest": "pWXyg1gvTW3yDOqvpnCmXX28h5aD23y6r-WIyhNI79I", "contributor": "0xc77b1448D157f25Bf9699BEE477cdF16cf9744b3"}

{"id": "MLi2tBpvNkSswis-iMo8IiIjDxp4LD-inudFJB8amWE", "title": "A man with his hands in his pockets will never climb the ladder of success", "body": "1、 I don't want to\nThe reason why you don't want to do it is that you haven't reached the end of the mountain for the time being, and you don't have to do it. You still have a choice to make, there is room for maneuver, and you can make choices according to your own wishes. The reason why you don't want to do it is because you are afraid of the whole seemingly difficult process and have no confidence in the possible results.\nBut not every ideal result can have an attractive opportunity at the beginning. You can see the future at a glance, and then put all your eggs in one basket. The same is true of opportunities. When they first appear around you, they are usually far from as beautiful as you think. They are like a piece of rough jade. Only when they are carefully carved can they show their luster.\nIn discovering beautiful things, many people only look at the surface and use perceptual thinking to select. We are always used to having a great purpose before we pay and invest. We do not do anything that is not good or that has little return, but we often lose the insight to see the essence through the phenomenon.\nLaziness is the poison of life and the gene of failure. No one wants to bite the hard bone, but life is not picky for you, and failure and suffering will not wait for you to knock when you are ready. You don't want to do it. There are many people who want to do it. When you want to do it, they have already done it. You don't need to do it. There are many things that you don't want to do. Everyone has their own negative feelings of fear of difficulties, but don't want to do it doesn't mean you don't have to do it forever.\n2、 I had no idea\nUnexpectedly, it is probably your excuse for your failure and your excuse for all imperfections. There are still a few things in Baimi. There are always many things you can't imagine, but nothing will happen or not happen because you can't imagine.\nFor the same event, you didn't expect it to succeed, so you can't do your best; You didn't expect it to fail, so you are more likely to take chances. You take \"unexpected\" as the reason for success, and attribute all the occasional and inevitable connections to luck.\nUnexpectedly, it is impossible to do it, let alone do it well. No one can predict the future, and no one can control the present. There are many unexpected things. You can't imagine the unexpected benefits brought by the completion of the set goals, let alone the unpredictable risks associated with each link. You can't think of it, but someone always wants it and does it well. Things are in constant motion and change, and any opportunity is left to the resourceful and prepared mind. When you really think of it one day, the opportunity may no longer favor you.\nWhen looking at problems, some people like to observe the surface of things and make analysis and judgment based on experience; Some people pry into the essence and go deep into its marrow. Even though things are ever-changing, only through careful consideration and implementation of future decisions can we have more possibilities to achieve.\n3、 I tried my best\nThe reason why you feel like doing your best is that you feel sorry for yourself and moved by yourself in the face of the established results; It is your psychological state of self satisfaction by comparing your current results with your previous achievements. But perhaps the source of this sense of satisfaction is that if you take a few more steps than before, increase a few percentage points, lift more weight and make more efforts, you will already be overwhelmed and can't bear to add weight.\nThe greatest potential of a person is to discover another new self in constant transcendence. If you don't dare to beat yourself and don't break the limit, you will never know how much energy you have. If you are blindly satisfied with the status quo, you will easily be defeated by reality.\nWhat's more, in this predatory society, it doesn't mean that if you try your best, you can have plenty of food and clothing and rest easy; It doesn't mean that if you try your best, you can avoid responsibility and get everyone's understanding. People who are better than you are trying their best to catch up, and people who are better than you are also trying to persist. You will not be eliminated unless you keep forging ahead and surpassing. Otherwise, we will be beaten if we lag behind. This is an indisputable truth.\nTrying hard is not equal to doing your best. Maybe you still have unknown potential waiting to burst out. You need to find a flowing outlet for it. Success always belongs to people who strive for self-improvement. If you do more, your life may be different.\n4、 It's impossible\nThe reason why you feel impossible is that you lack self-confidence, blindly defend yourself, and underestimate your energy and value. This is your arbitrary positioning. Before you put it into practice, you will be crushed by your own will.\nSuch people have pure motivation when they are in trouble. They only fight with preparation and confidence. They always refuse to take risks. They never dare to try easily and dare not challenge themselves. Refusal means that you will lose more opportunities. If you dare not turn the \"impossible\" into \"possible\", restrictions are everywhere. Therefore, your life can only be limited to the height of self judgment, and you will never be able to jump.\nIf you want to reach a higher position, you should have greater ambition and perseverance. There is no physical difference between people. They are all over a hundred kilograms of meat. They are biologically the same. The difference is in the soul. How big your spiritual world is, how broad your vision is, and how broad your life is. The boundary of a person's career lies in his heart. If you want to ensure the continuous growth of the boundary of your career, you must expand the boundary of your soul.\nThe stage is as big as the heart. There are not so many impossibilities in life. Self confidence creates miracles. If you want to succeed, you must have an undefended mind and bravely make every \"impossible\" possible. Then the perfect life \"possible\" belongs to you.\n5、 No one helped me\nThe reason why you feel isolated is mostly the result of your own life management. Some people find their way from one side to the other, and they are all powerful. Some people walk with difficulty and run into a wall everywhere. This is the projection of your self-worth on the social stage, reflected in your personality charm.\nIt is a mutual principle and an emotional bond between people to give back the love of others. No one was born with you as the center, only to help you; And no one will take the trouble to be your Savior, except your parents.\nSo if someone is willing to help you, it is a blessing of care; Even if there is no one to help, it is your duty. You don't have to complain about it. This is not the root cause of failure. There are many factors for success. It is not that people lose faith and give up their pursuit without help. If no one helps you, you can also learn to enrich yourself, enrich your heart, improve your ability and realize the odds of winning.\nThere are many roads in life, and many roads are only suitable for you. Everything can only be accomplished by cooperating with others. Such people are not mature. Only by pursuing not to be attached to anyone can you get freedom in the true sense.\nAt any time when there is no way to go, you can still trust your strength without help. Just like wearing a life buoy, you will never learn to swim; Only by breaking free of the reins can a horse gallop thousands of miles.\n6、 It's none of my business\nIn the face of punishment for mistakes and responsibility, in order to avoid possible risks and avoid unnecessary relationships, we often become cowardly and indifferent. We always like to use the sentence \"it's none of my business\" to try to get rid of the relationship and let others become scapegoats. But at the time of harvest, reward and reward based on merit, you can always sharpen your head. Even for small profits, you should be righteous and stand up as a \"hero\".\nIn the real society we live in, there is no clear boundary. As an independent individual in a social group, your existence is always inextricably linked with your surrounding environment. You should believe that all the people you meet are due arrangements, and your destiny is also in them. There will always be a change and transcendence, starting from the current situation. Therefore, you can not be short-sighted, easily refuse anyone's request, and cut off your own way back.\nEvery inch has its advantages. Everyone should depend on the outside world to survive. Helping others is a virtue of kindness, and your path will be widened in good deeds. In the face of the law of constant movement and development, you have to learn to bow your head, but those selfish and narrow-minded in the past will only make you have no way to go.\nTherefore, those who can achieve great things must be brave and responsible; A man with his hands in his pockets will never climb the ladder of success.", "timestamp": 1654534071, "digest": "G1IlaLzDXQgM1oprQVe7264IxwQolbOlak6pDONyARk", "contributor": "0x64Bf76a1149973adBB1F8A3185e05EBf93624fB1"}

More than 90 national leaders went to South Africa to attend the funeral. He won the respect of the world. Mandela spans the post colonial era, the apartheid era in South Africa, the Cold War era and the era of globalization. Different times have given him different identities. From the world's most famous prisoner to South Africa's first black president, from a revolutionary to a preacher of reconciliation and tolerance, the political and cultural labels superimposed on him are not only unique to him, but also reflect the common memory of his resistance and promotion of reconciliation at the same time, That is, the \"glorious years\" that the Chinese are familiar with.\nIn the process of historical evolution, Mandela also experienced spiritual cleansing again and again. Finally, under the guidance of the dream of building a \"Rainbow country\", he transcended race, color, religion and hatred, and turned from an indomitable fighter to a tolerant, philanthropic and tolerant practitioner. New South Africa has not been separated by historical feelings and hatred, and the African continent and even the world have benefited from it. The most fundamental reason why Mandela became Mandela is to forgive, tolerate and persevere. In the final analysis, it is to have a soft heart.\nA soft heart is invincible and can overcome everything. This applies not only to politicians, but also to all fields.\nThe young Inamori Kazuo went to the temple with his father to visit a Taoist monk and ask about the way of life. The eminent monk is a very old and thin monk. He looked at Kazuo Inamori carefully and said to his father, the child doesn't need to ask. Go back and ask him to say \"Nanman Nanman\" more in the future. \"Nanman Nanman\" means \"thank you\" in Buddhist Zen. Since then, Inamori Kazuo has kept the words of the eminent monk in mind and really talks about \"Nanman Nanman\" every day.\nInamori Kazuo is not a smart man. He often fails junior high school, high school and university exams. He wanted to be a doctor, but he could only get a job in a ceramic factory. The factory was on the verge of closure and could not pay wages. The morale of the employees was low, and they often vented themselves by striking. All four college students who went with Inamori Kazuo resigned, but Inamori Kazuo stayed. He lived and ate in the laboratory, kept thinking, and simulated again and again in his mind. The things that only appeared in the dream gradually became clear, and finally the boundary between dream and reality disappeared. Unimaginable things happened: Kazuo Inamori, who had neither professional knowledge and skills, nor experience and equipment, made the world's leading invention, bringing vitality to the factory that was about to close down.\nIn 1959, he founded Kyocera company, a large high-tech enterprise based on precision ceramic technology, but Kazuo Inamori himself did not come from a technical background. At that time, there were only 8 people in the company, all of whom were professional and technical experts. One of them, Inoue, was an expert in this field. After the well came up, Inamori Kazuo gave him his car and office, and even made room for Inoue and six other people in his newly decorated home. He rented a small, old bungalow. Inamori said to Inoue, \"I want to thank you for following me. I'm just a dreamer for Kyocera's future, and you are the real dreamer. It's not too big to dream, but it takes!\" Inoue and the other six people were deeply moved by the boss' spirit of concession and sacrifice, and vowed to devote all their skills. Sure enough, with the help of Inoue and others, Kyocera became a world-famous listed company 10 years later.\nWe are all familiar with the later events. Kazuo Inamori founded the second Telecom at the age of 52. At present, it is the second largest communication company in Japan after Japan Telegraph and telephone company. He is known as the \"Four Saints of operation\" together with the founder of Panasonic, Yukiko Matsushita, the founder of Sony, Akio Morita, and the founder of Honda. It is enough to win the respect of the world if a person starts from scratch and can establish one of the world's top 500 companies in his whole life.

", "body": "*Each week [RMX.PARTY](https://www.rmx.party/) sources a meme template for our caption contest. You, our community submit captions, and the winner gets a prize. Sometimes it’s ETH, sometimes it’s an NFT, and soon it’ll be a minted remix. It’s all a big experiment meant to be loads of fun while we iterate and test product ideas. This is the very beginning of our product story, and we’re writing it every week we learn, test and experiment. Our mission is to support creators and their audiences as they explore new forms of creation in web3. To that end, we also publish these weekly artist profiles. We hope you’ll join us on this journey, whether [here](https://mirror.xyz/rmxparty.eth), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmx_party), or on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rmxparty/).*\n\n## Contest 201\n\nWe’re in season two, week 1 (201) of our Meme Caption Contest (MCC). We took a pause to regroup, and come up with some fun ideas. First, we’re tightening our belts and launching the contest each week on **Tuesday at 12:00 PM ET. The contest will close 24 hours later on Wednesday at 11:59 AM ET.** We’ll announce the winner Wednesday afternoon. We’d like to ensure a regular cadence so you know when to tap your phone (or keyboard) and enter your wittiest captions. Season 2 Schedule\n\n**Contest opens:** Tuesdays 12pm ET \n\n**Contest closes:** Wednesdays 11:59am ET\n\n**Winners announced:** Wednesdays 5pm ET\n\nWhat will you win? We’re giving each of our three favorite captions a super fun, specially designed, unique NFT. Each week will see different NFT prizes, NFTs that we hope the winners will hold to see their value increase over time. Another reason to hold them will be the  unique perks (e.g. special access to future product features, our server, merch and more fun stuff like a mix tapes.\n\nThe next thing we needed to do was find evocative, thought-provoking, and humor-worthy artwork. We scoured socials, and NFT sites like [Foundation](https://foundation.app/), [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/). We then reached out cold-call style, to artists. It was crickets 🦗. We don’t blame them though cause who reads the ‘other’ files of their Instagram inbox. Rather than wait more time for our next ten weeks of the contest, we decided to just buy some NFTs we thought would elicit great responses and hit go.\n\nAfter we purchased, we were lucky enough to hear back from 0x4evr and we’re so excited to share their story with you!\n\n## Let’s Learn About 0x4evr:\n\n**RMX:** How do you like to be credited (i.e. do you prefer an alias or using your name?)\n**PC:** I’m Preston Chaplin IRL but use the alias 0x4evr in the NFT space\n\n**RMX:** When did you start creating? \n**PC:** 1996\n\n**RMX:** Where do you find inspiration/stay inspired? \n**PC:** I find inspiration everywhere but I’m easily inspired by nature, lighting, people, social situations, and social callings.

{"id": "OBzSaFIksyQshB8u5thG2HRwbSLirT83DUkTtMsDKF0", "title": "Key Reflections From The Book \"Reality Is Broken\" by Jane McGonigal", "body": "Although I don’t play games much (I played GTA a lot using cheat codes), I’ve always wondered why are games so interesting, addictive, and fun? And that curiosity led me to this book.\n\nTitled, “Reality Is Broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world”, it was written by Jane McGonigal, an American game designer.\n\nThe book was divided into three parts with multiple chapters in each part. And in this article, I am gonna mention some of the key and valuable lines that I’ve underlined while reading this book.\n\n> The truth is this: In today’s society, computer and video games are fulfilling genuine human needs that the real world is currently unable to satisfy. Games are providing rewards that reality is not. They are teaching and inspiring and engaging us in a way that reality is not. They are bringing us together in ways that reality is not.\n>\n> Jane McGonigal\n\n## Part 1: Why Games Make Us Happy\n\n* When you are in a state of flow, you want to stay there: both quitting and winning are equally unsatisfying outcomes.\n* What a boost to global net happiness it would be if we could positively activate the minds and bodies of hundreds of millions of people by offering them better hard work. That’s exactly what the game industry is doing today. All good gameplay is hard work. And when we do hard work that we care about, we are priming our minds for happiness.\n* By trying to have easy fun, we actually go from stress and anxiety to boredom and depression. We’d be much better off avoiding easy fun and seeking out hard fun, or hard work that we enjoy, instead. Within the limits of our own endurance, we would rather work hard than be entertained. Perhaps that’s why gamers spend less time watching television than anyone else on the planet.\n* **Extrinsic Rewards:** When we try to find happiness outside of ourselves, we’re focused on what positive psychologists call “extrinsic” rewards – money, material goods, status, or praise. When we get what we want, we feel good. Unfortunately, the pleasures of found happiness don’t last very long. We build up a tolerance for our favorite things and start to want more. It takes bigger and better rewards just to trigger the same level of satisfaction and pleasure. The more we try to “find” happiness, the harder it gets. Positive psychologists call this process “hedonic adaption”, and it’s one of the biggest hindrances to long-term life satisfaction. The more we consume, acquire, and elevate our status, the harder it is to stay happy. Whether it’s money, grades, promotions, popularity, attention, or just plain material things we want, scientists agree: seeking out external rewards is a sure path to sabotaging our own happiness.\n* **Intrinsic Rewards:** When we set out to make our own happiness, we’re focused on activity that generates intrinsic rewards – the positive emotions, personal strengths, and social connections that we build by engaging intensely with the world around us. We’re not looking for praise or payouts. The very act of what we’re doing, the enjoyment of being fully engaged, is enough. The scientific term for this kind of self-motivated, self-rewarding activity is autotelic. We do autotelic work because it engages us completely, and because intense engagement is the most pleasurable, satisfying, and meaningful emotional state we can experience.\n* What all intrinsic rewards have in common is they’re all ways of engaging deeply with the world around us – with our environment, with other people, and with causes and projects bigger than ourselves.\n* When a clear goal is attached to a specific task, it gives us an energizing push, a sense of purpose.\n* That’s what it takes for work to satisfy us: It must present us with clear, immediately actionable goals as well as direct, vivid feedback.\n* **Why failure is fun in games**: When we are playing a well-designed game, failure doesn’t disappoint us. It makes us happy in a very particular way: excited, interested, and most of all optimistic. The right kind of failure feedback is a reward. It makes us more engaged and more optimistic about our adds of success. The hope of success is more exciting than success itself. Winning tends to end the fun. But failure? It keeps the fun going.\n* Learning to stay urgently optimistic in the face of failure is an important emotional strength that we can learn in games and apply in our real lives.\n* Even if it’s a virtual world we are leaving our mark on, we’re still learning what it feels like to be of service to a larger cause. We’re priming our brains and bodies to value and to seek out the epic meaning as an emotional reward. And as recent research suggests, the more we enjoy these rewards in-game worlds, the more likely we may be to seek them out in real life.\n* We haven’t learned how to enjoy our real lives more thoroughly. Instead, we’ve spent the last thirty-five years learning to enjoy our game lives more thoroughly. Instead of fixing reality, we’ve simply created more and more attractive alternatives to the boredom, anxiety, alienation, and meaninglessness we run up against so often in everyday life.\n\n## Part 2: Reinventing Reality\n\n* As online role-playing games everywhere know, leveling up is one of the most satisfying kinds of feedback ever designed.\n* **About designing an alternate reality**: The less we fully participate in our everyday lives, the fewer opportunities we have to be happy. The emotional and social rewards we really crave require active, enthusiastic, self-motivated participation. And helping players participate more fully at the moment, instead of trying to escape it or just get through it, is the signature hallmark of alternative reality projects.\n* It’s a lot harder to function in low motivation, low feedback, and low-challenge environments when you’ve grown up playing sophisticated games. And that’s why today’s born-digital kids are suffering more in traditional classrooms than any previous generation. **School today for the most part is just one long series of necessary obstacles that produce negative stress**.\n* One of the abiding features of a good game: the outcome is uncertain. You play in order to discover how well you can do – not because you’re guaranteed to win.\n* When an experience is difficult for us, offering challenging goals, tracking points and levels, and achievements, and providing virtual rewards can make it easier to get through the experience. The most important work that game designers can do in the future: to **make things that are hard for us as rewarding – as intrinsically rewarding – as possible.**\n* Economists have demonstrated that offering people an extrinsic reward (like money or prizes) for something they’re already doing – and already enjoying – actually makes them feel less motivated and less rewarded.\n* In order to turn a group of strangers into a community, you have to follow two basic steps: first, cultivate a shared interest among strangers, and, second, give them the opportunity and means to interact with each other around that interest.\n* Researchers have shown that sharing the same space for even just a few minutes a day with kind and friendly strangers makes us more optimistic, improves our self esteem, makes us feel safer and more connected to our environment, and generally helps us enjoy our lives more.\n* While happiness might be our primary goal, we can’t pursue it directly. It’s too tricky, too hard to pin down, too easy to scare off. So we have to set other, more concrete goals, and in the pursuit of those goals, we capture happiness as a kind of by-product.\n\n## Part3:", "timestamp": 1654534383, "digest": "5tIKD51yjwOOqy_Ai1Z5Y-e2u35xRBIYIuQEOI3qlxE", "contributor": "0xFEFf4780017d1438C50AC0e46D0D36cD7A6d0C0d"}

We hosted virtual and IRL meetups, produced educational content, started a job board, and are hosting a virtual job fair, we want to become a hub to meet like-minded individuals, make new friends, and learn together.\n\nOver time we were seeing more and more crypto-curious members joining our community, but we recognized there was a gap in incentives and ownership opportunities for our non-crypto-native friends. With the rise of incentivized communities, DAOs, and utility NFTs we believe there’s a potential to bridge this gap through shared interests. **This inspired us to launch the first digital-physical makeup collective**, where beauty lovers would have the opportunity to craft, create, and curate beauty products and experiences.\n\n**MAKEUP FOR YOU BY YOU.** 💄✨\n\n### The Opportunity:\n\n*Women & Crypto*\n\nMore than two-thirds of US cryptocurrency investors are men, and about 60% are white.\n\n*Women & Consumer*\n\nWomen direct 83% of all consumption in the United States, in buying power and influence.\n\n*Women & The Beauty Industry*\n\nThe global beauty industry is worth $511 billion, but women only occupy 34% of board seats and 24% of executive positions at beauty companies.\n\n*Women & Leadership*\n\nAdditionally, 40% of women say that having women in leadership positions would positively impact all women's lives.\n\n*Women & Makeup*\n\nWomen in the US spend up to $200,000 on beauty products in a lifetime and $3,756 on beauty products each year.\n\n*Women & Online*\n\n93% of women are very online. 92% of women pass on information of deals or online recommendations to others.\n\n*Women & Curiosity*\n\nConsumers are 40% more willing to try new beauty products than before the coronavirus pandemic. 75% of customers are more likely to buy personalized products.\n\n### The Process:\n\n$Besties token holders, those who participated in our Mirror crowdfund (link_) and hold the Crypto Besties Governance token, and impactful contributors to the Crypto Besties community were given the ability to vote on what product we released, and it’s name, design, and color.\n\n### Our Future Roadmap:\n\n* Crypto Besties will continue to design in-house makeup/beauty products\n* Crypto Besties will explore more integration of the digital and physical landscape of the makeup/beauty worlds\n* Crypto Besties will work with other communities and influencers to produce makeup/beauty products using co-creation\n* Crypto Besties will work towards creating more opportunities for the community to be benefited\n\n**Sustainability:** The makeup industry is out of touch with releasing what products people actually want to see, leading to thousands of products going to waste. Crypto Besties with its limited drop format allows for products to be selected and tested by the community based on demand.\n\n**Access:** Many Creators want to be able to create their own brands and products, however, they lack direction and capital in order to achieve this. We will help them utilize the power of the DAO working model to bring more actionability to their marketing, building, and product testing.\n\n**Commitment:** Crypto Besties was started as a community to help women and underrepresented groups gain an understanding of a new asset class. Our commitment stands and we will continue educating those groups through partnerships and events on topics related to but not limited to financial freedom.\n\n**If you made it this far… We have some exciting news!** We’re releasing our first community-crafted product!

{"id": "g2R09mDQPhO0oQxctSJAQakPFidxvi7qvy11yDE7ohs", "title": "After brand identity: a designer’s journey", "body": "### Storytelling lessons from a web3 branding project\n\nI recently saw this image in my Twitter feed, captioned with the sentence: \"Literally every web3 project\".\n\n![\"Literally every web3 project\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FCdzKQriJVwICMRy5ZJXp.jpg?height=751&width=1500)\n\nI giggled along at first. Later, I thought about that tweet again, and I realised it was right! At the time, I was designing prototypes for our web3 app, [After.](https://after.fund/)\n\nMy experience was so interesting and enlightening that I felt it could be helpful for other designers, too. So, here I will showcase my **brand-design journey**, and describe the lessons I have learned.\n\n### Preliminary research\n\nMy eye-opening research on different web3 projects brought up **a wealth of identikit brands** that reflected everything the infamous tweet describes.\n\n![Similar illustrations and font style among web3 projects websites](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Jrl6CSsOymorWTZDwDgi.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\nThese results also show that when it comes to branding a web3 project, designers can be somewhat clueless. This is partly because such projects tend to focus on rigid technical concepts that feel abstract and unfamiliar.\n\nOther designers simply feel **overwhelmed by the infinite possibilities at their feet.**  Consider that most of these projects live exclusively in the digital world: hence, just about anything is possible! So why is it that we keep on doing the same things?\n\n### Storytelling is the answer\n\nThis is not the first time I have talked about \"storytelling\".  That’s because for me, **storytelling is more than a buzzword.**\n\nStorytelling is my only way of working, and **the only path that leads a brand towards a strong, relatable sense of identity and purpose.** This is compounded when we consider that, most of the time, both (identity and purpose) are sorely lacking from web3 brand identities.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I will illustrate the three steps that helped create our company's story.\n\n## Lesson01. Write your story from who you are, no matter how complex the technology or intangible the project.\n\nMost web3 projects try to paint a sophisticated brand identity, often using abstract and/or futuristic illustrations and imagery (*lesson 03*), blunt typography, and neon colours to explain who they are.\n\nThis is as far as their identities go, so no wonder they all look alike.\n\nFrom experience, I understand all too well that if you can’t explain “who you are” through images, you’ll also struggle to communicate your unique identity through words (aka content, *see lesson 02*).\n\nThe task becomes even more complicated when even you don’t know why your brand exists!\n\nTo overcome this issue, the first stage in branding your next web3 project is to **define your key differentiators** (in the form of a mission, vision, values and purpose). Only then will you **create a story that allows others to understand and share your beliefs.**\n\n**After** uses the blockchain technology of smart contracts to create **an automated, transparent, immutable, and private distribution of assets** at an event-based future trigger (for example the death of a person, or a change in their Will).\n\nAnswering Marty Neumeier's questionnaire (a set of 17 questions to find the *Onliness Statement*, that cardinal distinction that can help the business owners to create a prosperous brand.), we defined that our company's mission is **to help people realise the power of wealth.**\n\nFor this reason, the main inspiration for our story derives from the keys of Pluto. According to the Orphic Hymn to Pluto, among many other attributes, Pluto owns the keys that connect with God's capacity to give humanity wealth.\n\nIn ancient Greek burial practices, the **keys** symbolised revelations that the deceased was obligated to keep secret, along with a coin placed in their mouth to ensure a safe passage into the next world.\n\nWith such rich references to draw upon, the key became an essential visual element of After's branding, while the coin became **After's utility token #OBOL.**\n\n![After brandmark](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1lEDbqUMzrvrBRm4WMmDt.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\n**After's brandmark is a key**, which features a bespoke design of the capital letter A on the top. This brandmark is enclosed in a geometric hexagonal shape, representing the value of privacy and secrecy.\n\nThis sophisticated and elegant brandmark is paired with **a bespoke sans serif typeface** representing the bold encrypted structure behind creating a Will through After's platform.\n\nThe design of the capital letter above the key is also used to represent the utility token #OBOL.\n\n![#OBOL symbol and tokenomics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7AYiTtGX0_1h-DNybLFJV.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\n## Lesson 02. Build a community through content, and project personality through fonts.\n\nIn a world that is entirely digital, such as web3, typefaces can break traditional print-rules and enjoy the freedom they deserve on-screen… where they can be the stars!\n\nUnfortunately, when they are overused, large, animated typefaces create a bustling environment that tires our eyes and drains our minds’ focus from the rightful heart of the brand’s storytelling: **content.**\n\nOne beautiful side of the de-centralised web is the **communities** that form from similarities in specific ideas, and your project’s unique values (as explained in *lesson 01*). So, the right content is critical.\n\nIf this interaction is missing, you will deprive your users of **meaningful participation in the web3 experience.** No matter how fancy and futuristic your project is, make sure your typeface is also clear, legible, and humanly expressive, so it can properly introduce your project to its users.\n\nFor **After**, we wanted to build a community whose **values could inspire future generations.** After must communicate a sense of immutability and permanence, because this is our promise to the community.\n\nOur content also reflects how After speaks to **a primal human need** (the desire to ensure a better future for our loved ones), which is powered by blockchain technology (immutability and permanence).\n\n![Organization of the content on After landing page](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pj0WuTw5eHDE-_MRYa1c3.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\nOur values and duality are revealed in our specific choice of typeface.\n\nWe opted for **Frank Rhule Libre**, the digital version of a traditional serif typeface used mainly in print.  We then paired this with a modern sans serif font, **Lato**, which is exclusively designed for the digital world (though it looks good in print, too!).\n\nThe sans serif has been used in every header, to deliver essential concepts and help readers to scan the page effortlessly.\n\nLato, meanwhile, has been widely used in long paragraphs for its semi-rounded details that aid readability, as well as offering a sense of gravitas.\n\n![Some slides of our pitch deck to illustrate the usage of the typeface](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kt4Ms5XBxN853vjLjAkIH.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\nStorytelling also helped us to elaborate the delicate **concept of death** in a personal and expressive way, focusing on positive legacy rather than heartbreak. For this reason, the word **\"departure\"** was chosen over “death”.\n\nOur users are referred to as **Afterists**: people who have taken control of defining a positive future for their loved ones.\n\n**After** also promises to make the **journey** towards creating a Will both pleasant and accessible – a simple process that is literally at their fingertips.\n\n## Lesson 03. Illustrate your story: create differentiation with your own visual language.\n\nColours and illustrations are powerful storytelling methods.\nHowever, if your web3 project's visual language feels similar to that of so many other projects, **how can you differentiate yourself?**\n\nAs we have already touched upon, the alarming similarity is likely due to your attempt to explain the technology behind the project (which most of the time is complicated and feels unfamiliar), rather than explaining the values and purpose of your brand.\n\nWhen illustrated with intention, **a compelling story has the power to spark conversation.**\n\nIf you explore your company's key differentiators (mission, values and purpose), you will be forced to **think creatively about your brand's unique story**, and how you can harness its competitive power.\n\nIn the case of **After**, our values inspired our colours: from the very light, like white and pink (emotion, afterlife, purity, clarity, meditation, light), to darker, more sophisticated shades like purple and black (wealth, death, meaning, passage, spiritual).\n\n![After brand colors and values associated with each color ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zqXv2o4DfhxfKWGldDAxW.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\nThis content (including our mission and purpose) inspired our illustrations.\n\nAs we mentioned in *lesson 02*, we used the words *journey* and *departure* to introduce and explain our app. An inspirational story, the Myth of Pluto, describes **the journey in the afterlife.**\n\nHence, I created a series of illustrations that visualise the passage of our Afterists to a world that is peaceful and everlasting, crafted from expansive architecture and infinite skies.\n\nThe illustrations are also part of **a** **non-fungible token (NFT) collection called Elysium** (from the Greek, *Ēlýsion pedion*; a conception of the afterlife developed over time by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults).\n\nThe Elysium artworks, or NFTs, will be distributed as a ‘pass’ to join the community. Only pass holders can unlock community-specific channels, or gain access to exclusive perks and rewards.\n\n![Samples of Elysium NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q1zRxx_Gl6Btv7C73z3hr.jpg?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\n## Takeaways\n\nIn a world that changes so rapidly, storytelling can help web3 projects hold users’ attention, as they build lasting and memorable community connections. Working on our After's narrative, we learned:\n\n* Your mission, vision, values, and personality will **build your unique storytelling strategy.**\n* Your story will guide you towards choosing the right words for your content, and a typeface that clearly **expresses your ethos.**\n* Storytelling inspires illustrations that focus on the key differentiators, helping you forge **meaningful connections with your customers.**\n\n**We hope you enjoyed my designer's journey!  If you would like to start a new journey all of your own, that cares for and protects your loved ones, [you can visit After’s website to find out more.](https://after.fund/)**", "timestamp": 1654530998, "digest": "Wg9Dm5EOzloeGG0B0uNAzlh1EgcV96P9wQN1THSIC7w", "contributor": "0x38647F20D41ADE5BE2D68992dD6EFAE0ff0E0B24"}

When you multitask you will not have time to think on anything deeply.\n>\n> Charlie Munger\n\nMulti-tasking is something that we quite often do.\n\nWe aim to achieve a lot of things in a day, especially when we start something new. Responding to emails & and working parallelly & watching youtube videos at the same time will make us go insane.\n\nWe believe that we are doing a lot in less time, but it’s the opposite that is actually happening.\n\nWhen you are multi-tasking, you are just splitting your attention on multiple things and that will only kill your productivity. So you are definitely not getting more done in less time.\n\n## 2. Wishful Thinking\n\nThere is a difference between things that **you want to be true **and* ***actually true***. *I heard the term “Wishful Thinking” for the first time from Elon Musk in an interview. Here is what he said about Wishful thinking:\n\n> **You want something to be true even if it isn’t true** and so you ignore the real truth because of what you want to be the truth. This is a very difficult trap to avoid.\n>\n> Elon Musk\n\nCan’t be explained better!\n\nAnd the only way to avoid this trap is by thinking rationally. And how can we think rationally about a particular thing? By learning more.\n\nWhen we learn more, our beliefs change. The more you learn about what you do or what you are gonna do, the more chances that you won’t fall into the wishful thinking trap. It’s just a matter of finding the real(or hard) truths.\n\n## 3. Status Signalling\n\n\\#Bragging. #ShowingOff. #SocialMediaLife. #ImageOverSubstance\n\nWe are willing to spend money on something that raises our status rather than spending money on what we actually need.\n\nThorstein Veblen termed this phenomenon as “Conspicuous Consumption”. And the phenomenon basically is about how people spend money to gain status.\n\nNow that we are living in a social media life, showing off has become much easier. I mean, it’s easy to upload a post-workout selfie on Instagram once rather than working out 1 hour a day for the whole week.\n\nYou know what I am talking about… “Posting updates on Facebook to rub on the faces of our friends to make them miserable about their life”. The problem isn’t social media, the problem is how we use them. This social media thing is something that I am guilty of it too. Status signaling is one of the main reasons why we get addicted to social media and spend(or waste)tons of **Time**.\n\nAnd buying things to impress someone who you don’t even like is one of the best dumbest ways to spend **Money.**\n\n## 4. Working Too Hard!\n\nWhat? An entrepreneur has to work super hard, right? True! Working super hard will improve the odds for success for anyone.\n\nBut in that process, they end up ignoring their body and health.\n\nAn employee working overtime or an entrepreneur putting in more hours might see significant effects including stress, lack of free time, and health risks.\n\nJust because you are putting in more time, might not mean you are getting more done. Set your own timings and work your ass off. And take care of your physical and especially mental health parallelly. It’s ok to relax sometimes. It’s ok to spend time with friends and family.\n\nEntrepreneurship is all about playing long-term games and if your body won’t support you, it’ll become very hard.\n\n## 5. Victim Mentality\n\n“It’s not my fault. The outcome didn’t come out as expected because the one who I’ve hired didn’t do it well. Why does everything have to happen to me in that way”\n\nOr\n\n“If only I hadn’t been born so poor”.\n\nIf you think in this way when something goes wrong, then you have fallen into the trap of victim mentality. It feels satisfying(maybe that’s why it’s a trap) to think like that because you are putting accountability on fate, other people, etc.\n\nIf you are making endless excuses then something is wrong with you.\n\nThere are many things in life or business, that always go wrong and can’t be controlled. But how you react to those unexpected bad things is what matters.\n\n> It ain’t about how hard you hit, it’s about how you can get hit and keep moving forward. – Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone).\n\n**You need to be accountable** for what happens to you or the things you do. That’s the only way to escape this trap.\n\nBlaming fate for bad things or putting the blame on other people for whatever the bad things that have happened to you won’t solve the problem. It just keeps your mind satisfied, temporarily. **Because blaming is easy than being accountable**. But eventually, you’ll lose self-confidence and in the process, you give others control over you.\n\nPut the blame on yourself and move on.\n\n> When you learn to blame yourself blindly, you learn how to be happy.\n>\n> Garyvee\n", "timestamp": 1654535511, "digest": "y9HML42cYNM4hzBht3GOGrTjG6EMMa0Z1JXHyi8j5Qo", "contributor": "0xFEFf4780017d1438C50AC0e46D0D36cD7A6d0C0d"}

{"id": "6EnULnlb_DVFyYvbEGNFADPVkXH1ZP_DfnlqTRZsXCE", "title": "Ursula 3: An Interview with Hannah Whitaker", "body": "By **[Kristyna Archer](https://twitter.com/KristynaArcher)**\n\nHannah Whitaker’s body of work, *Ursula 3* examines our relationship with technology and digital servantry in contemporary life. Working meticulously in the studio between both analog and digital tools, Whitaker engages in a process of world-building around the development of a character named Ursula. As a continuation of an existing body of work, in this new series Whitaker incorporates special effects lighting, silhouettes, rear projection and fabricated sets to evoke a more established language of the Ursula lineage. She continues to push the exploration of gender stereotypes, AI, digital consent, and dehumanization. Whitaker is challenging the ubiquitous public domain of female bots and servants and highlights their consequences, damage, and complexities as we usher Ursula into a synthetic universe.\n\n![Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72oxJvdzDLQ-xbp5ZwCen.png?height=444&width=1280&&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: This series, *Ursula 3*, is an extension of your previous bodies of work featuring the same character. She is a female form, obscured in silhouette, against celestial, sci-fi inspired luminous backdrops, exploring the ever-present gender bias found in an increasing era of digital servants, AI, and sex-bots. In your new Obscura commissioned series, you overtly cover her form with futuristic, iridescent gloves, a hood, and a turtleneck, almost as if you were trying to unsex her image. Was this an attempt to see if you could in fact make her less objectified and perhaps more human?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** With their hard lines and geometric clarity, I think of the works as alluding to a graphic perfection that is ultimately undermined by all the dust and hairs of actual life. I think of Ursula similarly. She has a lovely profile and a sympathetic face and a long, skinny physique. In many ways, she adheres to conventional beauty standards and invokes an ideal form. But there is also something very strange and alien about her. (I’m referring now to Ursula, not Karen, who does an amazing job of embodying the character.)\n\nWhile Ursula clearly points to a physical ideal, to me, she has also always been and continues to be completely devoid of sex. Her expressions are calm and composed and her movements mechanical. I think of her as bloodless. So the reflective garments are in keeping with this. It’s not really about covering her form as her form is never really visible to begin with. But the garments, in accentuating her gestures, can create the sense of seeing her even if you still never really are able to.\n\n**ARCHER: I'm fascinated by the processes you have used to create Ursula’s universe. Rather than sketching out your compositions in the physical world, I read you design the rough final image in photoshop and then bring it to life with analogue processes, hand-cut masks, and layered exposures on 4x5 film. It feels purposefully disruptive, and in a way that is bold and irreverent. I’d love to hear more about the ‘why’ behind your process.**\n\n**WHITAKER:** The process that you’re referring to applies to older work of mine. Those works were multiple exposures shot on 4x5 film through hand-cut masks that I inserted into the camera. This allowed me to only expose parts of the film at a time. I could create images that looked constructed in a way that conventional photographs cannot. At the same time, it was still a completely optical process, so in spite of the planning and control, unforeseen details were always recorded. I liked the way that process allowed me to have an idea for an image and to then make it exactly. The process made me feel like a machine–I had to follow my own instruction sets for how to make the work. It was with those works that I initially developed the Ursula character. Her face and various body parts appeared silhouetted and often repeated in a mechanical and detached manner.\n\n**ARCHER: ​​As an artist that works in a very controlled manner, how do you allow for any happy accidents to occur during the process?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** I started shooting conventional photographs again a few years ago and doing so allows for many more opportunities for chance. I still do sketches and plan things out but the planning takes a different form than when I was making the film works. Now I procure props, set materials, and garments. I research source imagery and lighting techniques. I buy or rent photographic equipment I need. Karen Meléndez, the model I like to work with, doesn’t live in NYC so when she is in town I shoot tons of work at once. Even with all the planning, it’s really hard to predict what will work when I’m actually shooting. Sometimes the photographs are essentially exactly how I planned and sometimes what I planned doesn’t work at all and the photograph will hinge on some unexpected gesture or lighting accident.\n\n![Ursula 3 #15 (left) and #6 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kf-r-IsXPNSJuiRISTEbu.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: In the large scope of the project, AI and female voice assistants risk dulling our capability of intimacy. To me, these technologies become transactional and devoid of meaningful connection. Is this numbness of the digital era present in your work? Do we ever develop an empathy towards Ursula, or is the truth that one can not?  Are we in fact dehumanizing her, or is she actually a fully dimensional being, as you stated?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Certainly Hollywood thinks so! The notion of a fabricated woman who is created to serve her maker has been in the public domain for a very long time. The story of the female form untethered from the complexities of an actual human being has been told many times. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, written 8 AD, Pygmalian hates women so he carves one out of ivory and falls in love with her. I’m not sure how it relates to intimacy but ubiquity of passive and servile female digital assistants certainly reinforces damaging stereotypes. It seems clear from the innumerous similar stories of fabricated women combined with the impulse to gender digital servants as female, that women, in general, are dehumanized in the popular imagination as a matter of course. I’m not sure why Ursula would be any different. One reason I want those tangles of hairs and glints of light on her eyes in the photographs is to insist on her humanity.\n\n**ARCHER: In respect to the NFT avatar-driven PFP way of life where anonymity is the superpower, it creates this contrast of alluring mystery and inherent disconnection. Is this something you are exploring with the silhouettes?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Yes but only in the broadest possible sense. The work responds to a generalized sense of alienation and misrepresentation relating to technology and contemporary life. Online there’s difficulty in knowing people and being known in meaningful ways, particularly for women. Conversely there’s also a fear of being known, and there is a constant battle to protect oneself from unspecified threats. The work points to the complex relationship that human beings have with technology, which is constantly changing, and which no one could possibly fully understand in the moment.\n\n**ARCHER: There are elements of Trompe-l’oeil and illusion in your analogue-native work that manipulate the viewers’ perceptions and are intrinsic to your process. Do you feel this highlights the opportunities for disruption of non-digital-native art, like the impact of photography in the NFT space, as we continue to become more immersed in these digitally native worlds?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** I don’t tend to think of photography as not native to the digital space, though I get what you mean. I suppose NFTs started out with digitally-created images and photo NFTs came later. But photography has always been a huge part of the images trafficked online and a major driver of technology in hardware, software, and social media. Are the digitally native worlds interested in the veracity of an image? I don’t know!\n\nI personally like to make my work in-camera, not out of a sense of superiority to digitally native imagery, but because I think my work is more complex when the real world inserts itself into it. Karen is always trying to smooth out her hair when we’re shooting but I love seeing a tangle of hairs recorded in high photographic resolution. That way the photographs contain more than just my own ideas.\n\n![Ursula 3 #26 (left) and #14 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hPmwS2HeVrAtVvMxLLT4u.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: Is there any deeper meta interconnection between the idea of “right-click & save” of images profierating the internet, on top of being a series of images of a digital servant? The use and abuse of power runs deep. Abuse meaning, the stealing of image use without proper credit exists in web2. Now *Ursula 3* will be on-chain and can not be modified or detached from her owner.**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Right-clicking and saving images doesn’t bother me actually. I would be happy to have someone like my image enough to save it so they can look at it regularly. I mean, obviously I don’t want them to pass it off as their own or make money off it, but just saving it I’m okay with. To me, right clicking and saving isn’t an inherently abusive act and doesn’t undermine the commodity value of an NFT. But the connection that you’re drawing is interesting. I do think that the notion of a digital servant is related to wanting to have power over someone. Being able to abuse someone without any consequences comes with it. Maybe it relates to wanting to be able to do what you want all the time without constraint.\n\n![Ursula 3 #8 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LNjyacFH_R2nmMcbrDtcg.jpg?height=1024&width=758&&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: Do you see a conversation occurring between the Ursula character and these new contexts of blockchain, NFTs, and the metaverse that she now occupies?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** While I wasn’t thinking at all about NFTs when I developed the character, she certainly makes a lot of sense on a conceptual level in the NFT space. I mean, the project does touch directly on the question of how to represent people in the digital sphere.\n\n**ARCHER: In your artist’s statement, you mention you “usher her \\[Ursula\\] into a synthetic universe,” as if releasing her into the wild of the metaverse. Her release or escape into web3 is quite ironic in its evolution. If web3 is supposed to decentralize and flatten previous hierarchical societal constructs, can this new synthetic universe of the blockchain actually free her because inherently web3 hopes to disrupt and remove bureaucracy? Perhaps in effect she will be more free here than the gender bias that has been instilled previously?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** I would be shocked if Web3 will ultimately be spared the structural biases of the real world but I love your optimism! There’s a lot I don’t understand about Web3 but I don’t think anything made by people who developed consciousness in a flawed world (ie everyone) can really escape it.\n\n**ARCHER: With NFT culture highlighting digital, generative AI-driven art like nothing ever before in history, have these new technological paradigms inspired any thoughts on how you might introduce this into your own work? Have you ever considered implementing an actual AI process or forms of automation into your work processes that removes some of your control as an artist?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** The 4x5 film process started out as a way to remove some of my control as an artist. At the time I was thinking a lot about John Cage’s chance operations. But now that I’m working with a digital camera making conventional photographs, I don’t see myself relinquishing control any time soon. I’m really interested in photography as a medium–it’s history, its influence on culture, its power to seduce. In that sense, I’m still very interested in making my own specific kind of photographs. I want the images I make to comment on contemporary life but also relate to some of the images that I drew from– like album art from the 70s, or fashion photography from the 60s, or posters from the 80s.\n\n**ARCHER: Apparently, Siri got her name after the Norwegian name that means \"beautiful woman who leads you to victory,\" can I ask why “Ursula?” WHITAKER:** I have also heard that Siri was named for a specific woman – a Norwegian meteorologist named Siri Kalvig. I chose the name Ursula for a few reasons. I liked that it's a name that feels both old fashioned and futuristic at the same time. It’s also frightened with a lot of associations– the witch from the Little Mermaid, Ursula le Guin the feminisit sci-fi writer, and Ursula Andress a Swiss actress/bond girl/sex symbol. The triangulation of the villain, sci-fi, and iconic beauty seemed about right.\n\n![Ursula 3 #11 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccTQu0yBF57_7XnR0gVSk.jpg?height=1024&width=758&&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: What are you most excited about with what the blockchain offers for artists and what Obscura is doing in partnership with your future path?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Obscura basically funded the making of a ton of new work with no strings attached. I had total creative freedom. That’s never happened to me before in my entire career and it felt amazing. In general what I’m most excited about is the availability of new models of living and working for artists. I still operate in and appreciate the legacy art world but few would argue that it serves all artists well. I’m all for the creation of new income streams for artists, new opportunities for discourse about art, and new forms of community-building.\n\n![Ursula 3 #22 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dgllesZkOdyFkx1KNY4D6.jpg?height=1024&width=758&&size=medium)\n\n**To view the full collection** of Hannah Whitaker’s Obscura Commissioned drop:\n\n[https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker](https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker)\n\n**To view other NFT works** of the artist:\n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula](https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula)\n\n**Follow Hannah Whitaker** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker](https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker)\n\n**Follow Obscura DAO** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/obscuradao](https://twitter.com/obscuradao)\n\nJoin the **Obscura Discord:**\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/obscura](https://discord.com/invite/obscura)\n\nWant to **Contribute to the Obscura DAO?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik](https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik)\n\nWant to **Partner with Obscura?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9](https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654535773, "digest": "4hdx1pzHlhOTzQ5aAGCi0e7eQQtXu9r1hU1NpLD2K9I", "contributor": "0xFda746F4C3f9F5A02b3E63ed6d0eBBc002d1f788"}

{"id": "dBju96fvdLF8tdnme8FSmbDIVgCyuZJ3tmPfVqY8F5Y", "title": "Perpetual Futures & Funding", "body": "A perpetual futures contract, also known as a perpetual swap, is an agreement to non-optionally buy or sell an asset at an unspecified point in the future. Perpetual futures are cash-settled, and differ from regular futures in that they lack a pre-specified delivery date, and can thus be held indefinitely without the need to roll over contracts as they approach expiration. Payments are periodically exchanged between holders of the two sides of the contracts, long and short, with the direction and magnitude of the settlement based on the difference between the contract price and that of the underlying asset\n\nTrades on Tsunami settle in USDN, so all collateral used on the exchange is in USDN. This allows the protocol to leverage staking contracts of USDN to provide additional yield to TSN stakers.\n\nThe price of perpetual contracts will often diverge from the broader market (aka **index price**). These deviations signal sentiment on the exchange - if a majority of traders expect the underlying asset to increase in value over time, the price of the perpetual contract will likely exceed the index price. Likewise, if most traders expect the price to fall, the price of the perpetual will be below the index price.\n\nThere are two mechanisms that moderate this process, and function to keep the perpetual contract price close to the index price.\n\n### Funding payments\n\nEvery hour, traders with open long or short positions will pay each other a funding payment, depending on market conditions. If the contract price is above the index price, longs will pay shorts. If the contract price is below the index price, shorts will pay longs. The size of the funding payment is a function of the difference between the contract price and the index price, as well as your position size. This incentivizes traders to take the unpopular side of the market.\n\nPeriodic funding payments are the most common mechanism used by exchanges to do perpetual swaps. Funding payments act to converge the mark price (the price on Tsunami) and the index price (the average price from major exchanges).\n\nAn amount of funding payment is calculated using the formula:\n\n![Funding formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5NfJ9hRcBH_XIMQoMrBa2.png?height=43&width=522)\n\nAs a rule of thumb - the higher the difference between mark price and index price, the more funding you will pay when you open a divergent position, and the more you collect opening a converging position.\n\n### Arbitrage\n\nIf the contract price diverges significantly from the index price in other exchanges, arbitrageurs can benefit in two ways.\n\n1. If they hold a position elsewhere, they can use Tsunami to take the inverse position and earn funding payments.\n2. They buy or sell an asset elsewhere, and long or short that asset using Tsunami, in the expectation that the price will tend to move back toward the index price.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis way, Tsunami creates economic incentives for converging market and index price. Any imbalance creates a nice opportunity to arbitrage or take funding payment, that incentivize traders to open positions in convergent direction.

{"id": "y_eNByyCwrjSl-ictKlzLktTdXXepKRl2z-sT6QPPvc", "title": "veBAL Flywheel: Aura Launch Timeline and Boosted Launch Pool", "body": "In case you missed it, Aura is an **autonomous, non-custodial platform** built to boost the yield and governance power of Balancer users and beyond. Our launch is **right around the corner.**\n\nLast week, you were apprised about our plans for an airdrop and LBP to align key DeFi community stakeholders.\n\nToday, we want to highlight our launch timeline and more about how we plan to kickstart the ve Balancer (veBAL) flywheel with a boosted launch pool, which in turn will make **vlAURA a crucial medium** through which users can direct Balancer governance and incentives.\n\n## Launch Timeline\n\n* June 9th, 18:00 UTC\n  * Aura contracts deployed and verified on Etherscan; AURA tokens distributed to various time locks, vesting contracts, and multi-sigs\n  * **[LBP begins on Aura frontend](http://app.aura.finance/#/lbp)**\n  * [AURA locking](http://app.aura.finance/#/lock) into vlAURA enabled\n* June 14th, 18:00 UTC\n  * LBP finishes: assets transferred to treasury multi-sig\n  * AURA/ETH Balancer pool is seeded with ETH from LBP; protocol applies for Balancer gauge\n* June 16th, 10:30 UTC\n  * `auraBAL` deposits and boosted liquidity incentives begin\n  * Airdrop distribution starts, as [detailed here](https://mirror.xyz/0xfEE0Bbe31345a7c27368534fEf45a57133FF3A86/pHF9FFR2sn2ZTLNh6YCyCivb0p7W_uPB5m4diS4jz58)\n* June 23rd\n  * Gauge voting starts for vlAURA holders (those that locked before the 23rd can participate in the first round)\n  * Aura begins to take Balancer LP deposits, boosted by veBAL in system to give farmers higher yield\n* July 14th\n  * All penalties will be automatically redistributed to Aura Vote Lockers\n\n## **It’s a lot, and it’s honest work**\n\nThe incentive to lock BAL into Aura via auraBAL will be high from day one.\n\n**2% of the total AURA supply will be** **distributed directly to auraBAL stakers** (**important note**: including those that opt to lock their airdrop) **over the first two weeks** of the protocol.\n\nThose that choose to claim to their wallet their share of these rewards will **pay a 30% penalty,** in order to ensure AURA is utilized in the protocol from early on by active wallets. Those that vote lock **this AURA will receive the full amount.**\n\nThis large initial distribution is aimed at kickstarting the veBAL flywheel, and AURA’s governance influence over the Balancer ecosystem by extension.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dPoCQ5Hr8PwrPwxaQM-yR.png?height=408&width=612)\n\nAccording to Balancer Labs’ veBAL Dune dashboard, only \\~3 million, or 3% of the total supply of BAL has been converted into veBAL.\n\nA high headline yield will incentivize the locking of BAL into auraBAL. By making Aura the biggest, or at least one of the biggest, veBAL holders, **auraBAL and vlAURA holders will benefit from boosted yield and other governance incentives**. Aura’s end goal is to better direct and optimize incentives and governance power for stakeholders and liquidity providers.\n\nTo incentivize long-term auraBAL liquidity, an `auraBAL/[80/20 BAL/ETH BPT LP token]` StableSwap pool will also be launched, with 10% of AURA being distributed over four years to those that stake this pool’s LP token.\n\n## **LBP and liquidity pool details**\n\nWe settled on an LBP to be the mechanism for us to launch for three main reasons:\n\n1. An LBP is a good way to bootstrap liquidity for a new token in a formulaic manner\n2. Generate a treasury for Aura for bug bounties and system security audits\n3. It is a good way to onboard users who want to vote lock AURA early and begin participating in system governance\n\nAURA’s LBP will have two distinct phases, an approach we formulated after consulting with key stakeholders in the Balancer community.\n\nThe **first phase will begin on June 9th at 18:00 UTC**, with a 99% AURA and 1% ETH Balancer liquidity pool **at a starting value of $7.88** (assuming an ETH price of $1,750). It will end 72 hours later when the pool incrementally reaches a composition of 55% AURA and 45% ETH.\n\nThe **second phase will begin on June 12th at 18:00 UTC** and run for 48 hours. The trajectory of AURA’s price auction will be altered in the second phase based on market conditions during the first phase, to avoid flooding the market in harsh market conditions unnecessarily.\n\nDuring both phases, the swap fee for the Balancer pool will be 2%.\n\nAt the end of the LBP, **approximately 1.7% of the total AURA supply will have been distributed**.\n\nAfter bootstrapping concludes, up to 50% of the ETH contributed will be used to form a protocol-owned 80/20 AURA/ETH pool on Balancer, matched with 2-3% of the AURA supply (*dependent on the final LBP composition*). \n\nAura will also be applying for a Balancer gauge for this pool to increase its yield potential for users that wish to add liquidity.\n\n\n___\n\nThat’s all for now. We know it’s a lot of information but ahead of the LBP, we’ll make sure to give you a recap in case you need it. Stay tuned.\n\nAhead of the AURA token and subsequent Aura protocol launch, feel free to join the conversation and take a role in our community via our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aurafinance) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/aurafinance).", "timestamp": 1654535876, "digest": "Y4YsfSqL9FloMrfNvxKTBqrmvAiU1p_CS1DaZHeCREw", "contributor": "0x22FB5e64cba95d0E9Fd0b9B809E99e98f2747a03"}
