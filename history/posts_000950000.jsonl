{"id": "e7md4j2spWHe9QSMxdfcceIXg1ncR4xHv1CrNhjHzzI", "title": "In Process with Strange Cintia ", "body": "[edition://0x8D9cA6754c684B7B6fF8c61cEb2fC44F5F34Ec57?editionId=0](edition://0x8D9cA6754c684B7B6fF8c61cEb2fC44F5F34Ec57?editionId=0)\n\nI, JL Maxcy, am the type of person to leave early for every appointment. I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654767872, "digest": "ATd6GGBT-Yk3YjosRY1wskWnET708rQLtZL2IVaiq-E", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}

{"id": "jEPT22i-qn9muw57fPQfqkd7UpkFzefD6S_qckqqk10", "title": "In Process with Strange Cintia ", "body": "I, JL Maxcy, am the type of person to leave early for every appointment. I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654768129, "digest": "Vw9vnwc4GgSxa3VejdEWoSDu5gtZkOyUuHaaJRUqdio", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}

Where we feature inspiring interviews from up-and-coming artists, creators and NFT projects across the local and global NFT Community.\n\nWe first came across [Ee-Vee](https://twitter.com/Xcy8_), an LA based Australian NFT artist last August through the first Anime inspired NFT generative collection (7,777), [0N1FORCE](https://twitter.com/0n1Force) where Ee-Vee was voted a “Top 10 Global Finalist” for the first ever 0N1 Art Derivative Contest, as fan voted by the 0N1Force community.\n\nWe were originally captivated by Ee-Vee’s sophisticated art style when the majority of 0N1 Art derivatives submitted by the community were all using the main “[0N1Force](https://twitter.com/0n1Force)” PFP character for their Art derivative, Ee-Vee’s choice to use the smaller companion character as the main PFP art style was bold, different and this is why we believe this particular derivative art style stood out amongst the hundreds of artist submissions.\n\nA great lesson for aspiring creatives to explore a point of difference and perspective that can make you stand out and capture attention when submitting art and creating your project collections.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*w5AUeZQjuajqO3JbsY7mgg.jpeg)\n\nEe-Vee’s Oniforce derivative art submission, Top 10 finalisist as voted by the Global OniForce Community.\n\n***Hi Ee-Vee, tell us a little about yourself?***\n\nAs a creative, I often think of myself as relentless and curious. I kickstarted my career in car design : essentially, a complex and dynamic 3-dimensional artform, with very particular styling cues. Alongside this, I’ve always been fascinated by graphics and all things 2-d, and how flat images can tell complex stories. Right now, I’m fascinated by the intersection between these two worlds.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*MpHPCIpNpz65BjwbHY_7NQ.png)\n\nThe House of Tengu — An 0N1 Story — Xcy8 #0387\n\n***What are your favorite themes to explore through your art?***\n\nIn a word, storytelling. It’s all about emotion. Art can be a personal, co-creative experience when something in the viewer gets activated, when they are no longer a passive participant. They become active agents in building meaning, and make the art come alive.\n\n***How did you get started in NFTs?***\n\nI created derivative fan-art for [0n1 Force](https://twitter.com/0n1Force) which got shortlisted as a top-10 entry. The love from the community, together with the commissions and opportunities that followed, helped me feel like there was something of value I could bring to the space.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*qH2wNanEsMbzVKZo9mdSLQ.png)\n\nThe House of Tengu — An 0N1 Story — Xcy8 #4417\n\n***What is the biggest challenge you’ve faced getting into NFTs?***\n\nIt would have to be the wonderful blend of feverish excitement, uncertainty and endless FOMO and anxiety that is the hallmark of the NFT space.\n\n***How do you see NFTs changing your artistic career?***\n\nAs an artist, I see NFTs doing something unprecedented: they offer free and instant exposure to united, inclusive and welcoming communities from all around the globe. I’m wildlly excited at the thought of adding creative currency to boundary-pushing projects, and at designing collections with visual impact.\n\n***Are there any NFT lessons learned you’d like to share?***\n\nIt’s important to know your outcomes and develop sound strategies to help you make the right calls. I feel it’s important to take the time to learn where NFTs have been and where they’re headed — this will help you back the projects that are right for you. But then again, this space moves very, very fast, and you can become unbelievably lucky overnight.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*jAQMHLUfK1kb_CldrWWVrQ.png)\n\nThe House of Tengu — An 0N1 Story — Xcy8 #1379\n\n***What are you working on now?***\n\nI still loving designing cars, so that’s keeping me pumped. I’m also building out my art portfolio, with a focus on 3d pieces — there is no shortage of inspiration from new artists and projects in this space!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*844enOJyLAFyaX6jF2W-eg.png)\n\nThe House of Tengu — An 0N1 Story — Xcy8 #895\n\n***What advice would you give to artists entering the world of NFTs?***\n\nJump in, dive deep. This is a spectacular moment in history, with artistic opportunities unlike ever before.\n\nEe-vee is definitely an artist to watch in this space and we’re excited to see what future projects and collaborations are in store!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Efk-9j3b4aDZhqh_vuTs6A.png)\n\nCheck out Ee-Vee’s Social Media and NFT project links below.\n\nTwitter: @[Xcy8_](https://twitter.com/Xcy8_)\n\nOpensea:[ Xcy8 3750](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1beed1d6831cc077636a08bdc66c2f5602869198/17)\n\nOpensea: [House of Tengu, Xcy8](https://opensea.io/collection/house-of-tengu)\n\n***If you’re looking to be featured either as an artist, community builder, or NFT enthusiast please reach out to us at hello@nftsyd.io***\n\n \n \n\narticle by [@svmmerstein](https://twitter.com/svmmerstein)\n\n[crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=](crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=)\n\n \n \n\nnft syd, nft sydney , nft community , nft australia", "timestamp": 1654767850, "digest": "ZXF77fiH4YJ6DGkyVNRBT3bLdqdVf3xYsi9ifpxB5Bw", "contributor": "0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4"}

Facts need storytellers to breathe life into them, so I use photography as my vessel.\n\n***How would you define your artistic style?***\n\nBy grasping on to my fascination for our natural world I capture thought-provoking imagery that helps others see the planet as a whole. I discovered that by coming from a place of awe, I could bridge the gap between art and science to establish a compelling narrative around sustainability.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3HSOmku1LqD5XDec8HB7_g.png)\n\nAmbience (Foundation), Artist: Gabriella Morton\n\n***What’s your inspiration when creating your art?***\n\nI have a variety of unreleased work but I’ve been trying to marry them with a way to give back.

I broke 6 bones and spent 3 months in a wheelchair and became unable to continue work as a freelance photographer. The silver lining has been the gift of time to navigate this space and understand the benefits of digital ownership and the future of image licensing.\n\n***Collaborations are becoming increasingly common and popular in the NFT space. Have you done any collaborative work recently and how was that experience for you?***\n\nI think the splits feature on Foundation is so encouraging to get outside your comfort zone and double down on sharing the load. I recently made this peice with Ashton, and although we’d had it listed for months when we secured our sale I can confirm that the excitement was even better shared!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*b6cvJMlaYsYVPLp0gFwjoQ.png)\n\nIsolation (Foundation), Artist: Gabriella Morton and Ashton Lee\n\n***What is your favorite part of the NFT community?***\n\nNFT’s feel like a digital renaissance where creatives can cut the middlemen and advance passion projects to the driver’s seat. We’ve never had so much freedom for producing non-commercial work while gaining sustainable financial compensation. I can’t wait to see how the physical world utilizes smart contracts and understands the value of provenance.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6w0CdBnC8GdwVr7reb87sw.png)\n\nEthereal (Foundation), Artist: Gabriella Morton\n\n***What advice would you give to artists entering the world of NFTs?***\n\nAt this point, Twitter is a non-negotiable for marketing your NFT’s. It’s predominantly verbal and comes down to community building and networking which happens in live interactive podcasts called Twitter Spaces. It’s all extremely fast paced and ever evolving, so you first must be willing to listen and absorb. Ads and influencer marketing stick out as ingenuine, so you really need an organic, consistent, and cohesive story to build a recognizable and identifiable story.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*aeO8Q8A7BC0J896Bqtkbyg.png)\n\nSurface (Foundation), Artist: Gabriella Morton\n\n**Stay connected with Gabriella through these Social Media links**\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/gabriellamort>\n\nInstagram: <https://www.instagram.com/gabriellamorton/>\n\nFoundation: <https://foundation.app/@gabriellamorton>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*wHcMcqrp1F6tEso9dKsiqA.png)\n\n*Our aim throughout the **NFTSYD Artist Series** is to provide our community with helpful insights and practical tips to learn from emerging and established artist experiences, as you navigate through your own creative journey with Non-Fungible Tokens as a creator, collector or enthusiast.*\n\n***If you’re looking to be featured either as an artist, community builder, or NFT enthusiast please reach out to us at hello@nftsyd.io***\n\narticle by [@svmmerstein](https://twitter.com/svmmerstein)\n\n[crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=](crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=)\n\nnft syd, nft sydney , nft community , nft australia", "timestamp": 1654768067, "digest": "JMqoZaL0M9WgZv1t8Po_Lj6imod4SLIWXY3P4BCkTNw", "contributor": "0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4"}

Now my day job is in Marketing (with some photography).\n\nI fell into photography through a time of tragedy & my images represent the light I saw after the darkness of grief had me trapped for many years.\n\nI started photography in 2016 armed with an iPhone, I was on a holiday with friends in South Australia and I saw the most beautiful sunset and took a photo, something in me clicked, literally. The next day I walked for 10 hours, just shooting, I was hooked.\n\nI shot every day up to 2019 when I purchased a Nikon Z6, I started again and attended workshops and online tutorials. I’m so proud of my achievements having received 4 Honourable Mentions in the 2017 and 2019 International iPhone Photography Awards, finalist in the 2017 Busselton Jetty 30 year Celebration Photo Competition, Honourable Mention in the Australian Photographer of the year, Mobile Category in 2018 and finalist in the 2016 and 2018 Blink Photographic Awards.\n\nWith the camera I have received a Commendation in the Landscape category in the The Australian Photography Magazine Awards competition, been featured by Nikon Australia and my images used for their My Nikon Life celebrations.

My sister is 14 years older than me and so growing up I always looked up to her and knew this was something I wanted to do.\n\nAt age 13 I came across some photos from people on the edge of city building rooftops in Sydney and immediately knew it was something I wanted to do.\n\nI fell into the urban exploration subculture and it consumed my life for the following five years. I found a group of like minded individuals, and from there we figured out how to access the roofs of hotels and office buildings, and put in hours learning the entry and exit points of train tunnels. While the rest of my peers would spend their weekends partying and consuming [goon sacks](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/goon-bag) in public parks, I could be found walking on the edge of city skyscrapers and dodging speeding trains, all with a camera in hand.\n\nAll of this wasn’t without consequence — at age 16 I found myself arrested, and at 17 I broke my back whilst running from security at a building site.\n\nI’ve since quit exploring and moved onto other creative ventures, but I have lifetime’s worth of photos and memories from my teenage days.\n\n***When did you first get into NFT’s?***\n\nI started looking into doing NFTs in March of 2021, but I didn’t end up launching a [opensea collection](https://opensea.io/collection/keys-to-the-city) until October of 2021.\n\nIn all honesty I never really took my photography seriously as ‘art’. It’s not the sort of thing that is typically recognised or respected amongst the art world.\n\nHowever, I was completely inspired by fellow international explorers such as **[Driftershoots](https://www.instagram.com/driftershoots/)** and **[Tom Durante](https://www.instagram.com/tomdurante/)**[ ](https://www.instagram.com/tomdurante/)who took the leap into NFT’s and absolutely thrived. It is clear now that NFTs are a powerful means for artists who create work that falls outside the realm of the traditional gallery system.\n\n***Are you currently working on any projects or collaborations ?***\n\nI’m currently featured in an **‘[Aussie Artists Collective](https://twitter.com/AussieArtistCol)**\\*\\*’ \\*\\*online gallery amongst 68 other Australian photographers which has been cool to be a part of.\n\nWhat I’m most excited about is an upcoming project I have with my good friend **[@carlhowski](https://twitter.com/carlhowski/)**. We’re planning to hold a physical NFT gallery space here in Sydney early 2022. This is where I plan to launch my next collection. Carl and I have travelled all over Australia exploring together and he’s one of the best photographers I know, so it’s only right we do this together as well.\n\nI don’t want to give away too many details about the gallery yet, but keep an eye on my social media accounts to stay tuned!\n\n***How do you seek out opportunities to connect with the NFT community and continue to build your profile?***\n\nI try to stay as active as possible on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sllippn) and connect with other [Australians ](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1461133221509296134)who are involved in the NFT scene. I also communicate often with other urban explorers across the globe. We’re in a big group chat together and everyone seems to have each others’ backs and look out for opportunities for each other.\n\nIf the opportunities aren’t there though, I’ll do my best to create them for myself and for others.\n\n***Do you have any advice on how to cultivate a collector base?***\n\nI’m still at the beginning of my NFT journey so I don’t want to speak like I have a strong collector base yet! But from what I’ve experienced and learnt, if you believe in yourself and your art fully, people will too. If you have put in hours, blood, sweat and tears, it will show through your art. I think if collectors are assured that you are in it for the long haul and you can provide value to your work, they will invest and others will follow.\n\nI also think it’s about finding your niche and putting your work in front of the right people who will be interested in your work and have the capacity to invest. This is something I’m still working on, but I plan to keep pursuing it in the near future.\n\n**Who are some of your favourite NFT artists?**\n\nThe boys I mentioned above **[Driftershoots](https://www.instagram.com/driftershoots/?hl=en)** and **[Tom Durante](https://www.instagram.com/tomdurante/)** are amazing and have some incredible artwork. I also love the work of fellow explorers **[@flashinglighhts](https://twitter.com/flashinglighhts)**, **[@NYC_Awaken](https://twitter.com/NYC_Awaken)**, **[@lilmahnaji](https://twitter.com/lilmahnaji)**[ ](https://twitter.com/lilmahnaji)and **[@officialdoumer](https://mobile.twitter.com/officialdoumer)**.\n\nI also think it’s super dope to see other artists such as **[AIMOS](https://twitter.com/IAMAIMOS)** make waves with his NFT project ‘Now Crediting’. This is something that really demonstrated how NFTs can give power to an artist and allow them to get the credit they deserve.\n\n***What are your other creative passions besides art?***\n\nTo be honest, art is pretty much my whole life haha.\n\n***Any advice to anyone looking into entering the NFT space?***\n\nI can only speak for NFT artists, but I’d recommend people to take a lot of time to curate their collections. Allow your work to tell a cohesive story. Put yourself out there on social media, and connect with as many people as you can. Also, believe in yourself fully!\n\n**We look forward to seeing more urban exploration NFT photography in the future and we’re excited to see what [Slippn](https://twitter.com/sllippn/)** has in store with the upcoming NFT Gallery exhibition.\n\n**Be sure to stay connected with [Slippn’s](https://twitter.com/sllippn/)** through these social media links.\n\n**Website:** [slippn.com](https://www.slippn.com/)\n\n**Instagram:** [Slippn](https://www.instagram.com/slippn/)\n\n\\*\\*Twitter: \\*\\*[Sllippn](https://twitter.com/sllippn)\n\n**Opensea NFT Collection**, [Keys to the City](https://opensea.io/collection/keys-to-the-city)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*c_gHJlNYezA_mSgnB17neg.jpeg)\n\n[While the City Sleeps — Opensea NFT Collection, Artist: Slippn](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/269403156313629215206437666834862288230381661764480494041151008005402132481/)\n\n**ABOUT NFTSYD**\n\nThe inaugural [NFTSYD](https://www.nftsyd.io/) in person event in Sydney, Australia will be a deep-dive into everything NFT.

{"id": "zWxw0hUZv11QCU8uOJD6PUDlUOPLIhTVgq7ft_66wUM", "title": "从HODlers增持看比特币市场趋势", "body": "在5月初的抛售之后，增持趋势正在发生一些值得注意的转变。比特币HODLer（坚定持有者）仍然是唯一剩下的增持群体，他们的增持行为预示着当价格修正到3万美元以下时他们会加倍买入。\n\n比特币价格本周继续盘整，此前有初步迹象表明数字资产市场与传统股票市场之间可能出现脱钩，尽管这是在方向错误的情况下。本周标普500指数从低点反弹了7.4%，纳斯达克指数上涨了9.6%。与此同时，比特币交易跌至28261美元的低点，仅在周一早些时候反弹，恢复了30710美元的周高点。以太坊也经历了艰难的一周，下跌了17.8%，至1700美元的低点，然后在周一早上反弹至1900美元。\n\n在本月初 LUNA 引发抛售事件后，比特币在链上的积累趋势出现了明显的行为变化。特别的是，余额<100 BTC 的实体和那些拥有>10000 BTC 的实体一直是重要的积累者。其余的钱包群组也从净分配者过渡到中立者。这反映了与2月至5月中旬期间相比，行为上的明显转变，后者是间歇性的积累和分配，反映了不确定性和资本循环。\n\n然而，链上活动仍然呈现疲软状态，除了现有 HODLer 之外，几乎没有迹象表明对该资产有新的兴趣。也就是说，留下来的 HODLers 似乎愿意在价格下跌时加倍买入，并且即使处于亏损状态，也不愿意抛出 coins。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OWKkYlhbbQtB8DzN3vQCs.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：22周的价格\n\n**仅剩的HODLers**\n\n最近几个月，我们强调了比特币的链上活动如何既低迷又稳定的。这是过去熊市的一个典型特征，网络的交易活动由对价格不敏感的 HODLer 主导。\n\n在 2021 年 5 月的抛售之后，我们目睹了一场钱包的适度“清洗”，因为持有者大量抛售了他们持有的 coin。此后，由于不确定性悄然进入投资者心理，边缘买家被缩水冲出市场，钱包增长出现了长达四个月的平稳增长期。\n\n正如我们在下图中所看到的，最近的价格表现不佳，这使钱包的增长在短期内暂停，尽管与2021年5月的规模不一样。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/devA78lspmpr-FG8TVSKd.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：在非零账户余额下的地址数量\n\n在 LUNA 引发的抛售等高度波动的事件中，我们经常看到链上活动增加，因为持有者恐慌、抛售或以其他方式将 coins 转移到保证金和补仓。在2020 年 3 月和 2018 年 11 月，抛售后活动数量的上升引发了随后的牛市。\n\n虽然不能排除这种可能性，但我们可以看到，活跃地址和实体都对这些活动的增加做出了反应，并回到了在2021 年 9 月以后形成的范围。换句话说，最近的抛售和较低的价格还没有激发新用户涌入该领域，只有 HODLers 有买入。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ry3xx-JLAFOB6r3BqNyR9.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：活动和地点\n\n**累积行为的转变**\n\n当然，链上活动只是现状的一部分。虽然钱包增长和活跃实体可能停滞不前，但该分析并未考虑剩余持有者和钱包的经济价值。随着价格修正走低，HODLers 每美元获得更多 BTC 的能力增加，这引导我们去研究动态的供应的领域。\n\n累积趋势得分在行为上出现了值得注意的转变。近两周来，它已经回到了0.9以上的接近完美的分数。这表明，网络上的现有实体正在大幅增加他们的持股。这是一个明显的突破，在1月至4月的盘整区间（橙色）期间返回的断断续续的分数可以合理地归类为相对低的信念积累。\n\n先前持续高累积趋势得分的情况分为两类：\n\n* 牛市运行期间的高分（蓝色）——在市场顶部的时候，聪明的资金在卖出他们的余额，同时更多经验不足的新买家涌入。\n* 熊市趋势期间的高分（绿色）——通常在价格大幅下跌后触发，因为投资者的心理从不确定性转变为价值积累。但是有一个明显的例外是2021年12月的ATH时期后，\"低点 \"被证明并不是低点，尽管价格大幅度回调，但是有许多 coins在亏损的情况下被卖出。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kaFoUIhgkGqt9KPECXgIs.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：累积趋势得分（7天移动平均）\n\n如果我们对造成这种高积累分数的各种钱包群组进行剖析，我们可以确定两个特定的群体：<100 BTC 的实体，和>10000 BTC 的实体。\n\n研究前者，我们可以看到，在最近的抛售后，他们的钱包总持有量的梯度增加了。此外，这个群体的总余额增加了80,724 BTC，与 LFG (LUNA Foundation Guard)清算的80,081 BTC 净额惊人地相似。实际上，来自<100 BTC 的实体以较低的价格增加的需求已经抵消了 LFG 为维护 UST 挂钩而清算的供应。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P6KLQwTe0JEKsJyO4b58f.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：持有< 100 BTC的实体总供应量\n\n另一个促成高积累趋势得分的群组是持有超10000 BTC 的鲸鱼。在5月期间，这些实体的余额增加了46269 BTC，需要注意的是，这包括从 LFG 钱包中抛售的80000 BTC。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IymYodmh6kB90puFXkE5S.png?height=621&width=1080)\n\n比特币：持有> 10000 BTC的实体总供应量\\[BTC\\]\n\n这些观察在很大程度上可以通过检查按钱包群组指标划分的积累趋势得分来证实。在这里，我们可以看到，自抛售以来，持有<100 BTC和>10000 BTC的实体返回了蓝色信号，表明他们的余额在最近几周有了显著增加。\n\n这与抛售前的相对疲软的价值相比，是一个明显的转变，尤其是当鲸鱼成为卖出主力。其余拥有100-10000 BTC 的钱包群组保持了0.5左右的中性评级，这表明他们的持有量的净变化相对较小。\n\n在下一节中，我们将调查长期持有者的行为，以进一步完善我们的观察。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W2YyccXG7tDnB6Js4_slL.png?height=541&width=1080)\n\n比特币：钱包群组累积趋势得分\n\n**长期损失**\n\n我们现在已经将参与最近链上积累的各种钱包大小群组形成一个案例。接下来，我们转向长期持有者（他们代表了在波动期间最不可能消费的人），以衡量投资者的信念。请注意，过渡到 LTH 状态大约是在 155 天前，即 12 月下旬，当时价格约为 47000 美元。\n\n如果我们看一下2022年4月1日的 URPD 指标，我们可以绘制出 LUNA 抛售之前的 coin 分布概况，重点可以关注 2021-22 周报。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T27BirNM-OlHlPbw8mAl8.png?height=652&width=1080)\n\n比特币：经URPD调整后的实体\\[BTC\\]\n\n下图是 4 月 1 日的概况，并用今天的 URPD （下面的蓝色线条）来覆盖它。由此我们可以评估 coin 分布的变化并做出以下观察：\n\n* 150万 BTC 发生了大规模的重新分配，从主要在42000-49000美元范围内的买家，到下降至当前26700-33000美元范围内的买家。\n* 其他地方的 coin 分布与 4 月 1 日的情况非常相似，这表明对价格不敏感的 HODLer 群体继续主导着比特币持有者的情况。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-67iSTzFXt_bq5H59r2u2.png?height=653&width=1080)\n\n比特币：经URPD调整后的实体\\[BTC\\]\n\n当前币龄小于 3 个月的 coins 的下降趋势支持了这一观察。回顾上一个盘整区间（3月1日之后的3个月）x中间往后所有抛售的 coin ，当3m处的 HODL 波段的下降趋势产生影响时，从净值上看，更多的是币龄更高的 coin。\n\n从这两个指标中得出的关键结论是，在 11 月 ATH 之后积累的 coin 持有者似乎对价格相对不敏感。尽管价格持续下跌，并且发生了80000+ BTC 的重大现货清算事件，他们仍然不愿意放弃他们的 coins。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yw_k8VENAN7wT5ykvXA-C.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：HODL已实现的浪潮上限（<3m）\n\n回想到长期持有者阈值位于12 月下旬，那么 LTH 总供应量最近趋于稳定也就不足为奇了。在过去的几个月里，LTH 门槛一直在沿着从 11 月到 1 月的下降趋势移动。\n\n通常，供应积累发生在横向价格区间内。这意味着在大约 1 个月的时间里，LTH 阈值将进入之前确定的33000-42000美元之间的盘整区间。根据 URPD  的资料，大量的 LTH 供应发生在1月至4月期间。\n\nLTH 供应最近恢复到1304.8M BTC 的 ATH。除非大量的 coin 重新分配，否则我们可以预计该供应指标将在未来 3-4 个月内开始攀升，这表明 HODLers 会持续循序渐进去吸收并保持供应。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uDxg-kSagxgg54TOTKAVP.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：LTH总供应量【BTC】\n\n然而，尽管有建设性的前瞻性观点，但仍有一小部分 LTH 目前正在抛出coins 并导致了亏损。LTH-SOPR 指标可以看作是 LTH 每天实现的平均利润倍数，这个指标很少低于1.0。\n\n本周，我们看到与购买 coins 时相比， LTH 平均花费27%的 coins 锁定损失。过去，此类事件仅在 2015 年、2018 年和 2020 年 3 月等熊市至低点期间发生。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DJUZ-g_5Ri_v63w5QmL5a.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：LTH-SOPR （7天移动平均）\n\n以 LTH-SOPR 作为已实现利润倍数的指标，因此，我们可以从 LTH 抛出的coins “来源”中得出平均价格，即“抛出价格”。LTH 抛出价格（粉红色）很少高于市场价格，但目前在 7 天移动平均线基础上交易价格为 32.8 万美元。上一次 LTH 锁定这样的损失是在 2020 年 3 月的抛售事件之后。在2018 年的熊市中，这发生在 LTH 连续数月下跌之前，并最终导致价格再次下跌 50%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1cw7I-2ZzQ7xoBZlN6Hnx.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：价格长期持有者的抛售\n\n**总结和结论**\n\n自2021年9月以来，比特币的链上活动趋于平稳，到目前为止，几乎没有迹象表明这种情况会发生改变。这表明 HODLer 是最后的比特币购买者，也是唯一的买家。这也可以从他们不愿意抛出持有的比特币中看出，即使现在是亏损持有。\n\n在 LUNA 引发抛售后，链上的积累趋势发生了显著变化。<100BTC 的实体似乎已经吸收了相当于 LFG在脱钩期间抛售的BTC数量的BTC。与大多数长期持有者一样，越来越多的以似乎较低的价格囤积和收购 BTC 的 HODLer 出现。不出意外的话，这种趋势预计将会在未来几个月推动 LTH 的持币量超过 ATH。\n\n通过对比特币所处宏观环境的密切关注，有迹象表明数字资产和股票之间存在脱钩。是否会重新出现相关性回报以及市场对通货紧缩如何反应还不确定，但风险仍然很高，对于对价格不敏感的 HODLers 来说也是如此。\n\n文章来源：https://insights.glassnode.com\n\n原文作者：Checkmate\n\n原文链接：https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-22-2022/", "timestamp": 1654767969, "digest":

That object is often a digital asset (**Token**) and might take the form of a music, picture, book, contract, or legal agreement. Almost everything that can be produced digitally may be classified as an asset. So long as it's original and not plagiarised, which was the primary fear of online artists when it comes to putting anything on the internet... until blockchain came along.\n\n## Blockchain, huh?\n\nBlockchain is the technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency variants. Blockchain is a digital public ledger that records data and prevents it from being altered.\n\nConsider a spreadsheet that is shared across thousands of computers all around the world. Consider this network of computer that will be used to update this system of records doing it on a regular basis.\n\n## Blockchain and web3 ❤ NFT’s\n\nWe now have a basic understanding of what an NFT is and how blockchain works. What's the connection between the two? The blockchain technology is required to verify and protect NFTs, ushering us into the era of digital ownership.\n\nWe can now verify if an NFT belongs to a given wallet thanks to the strength and power of blockchain technology (blockchain address). This is extremely powerful because we've never had the technology to verify ownership of something on the internet before, but now we do. As a result, we can now certify that a single wallet has a unique piece of art.\n\n**But what about 'right-click and save'?**\n\nMany people say that simply capturing a snapshot of an NFT means they can claim ownership of these NFTs. Well..taking a snapshot of a Picasso does not imply that you own it. You are not the lawful owner of an asset just because you took a snapshot of it. Blockchain technology gives you ownership of the original (smart) contract and a total claim of the NFT (asset).\n\n## NFTs and Community\n\nNow that we know what NFTs are, the major issue is why individuals are willing to spend half a million dollars on pixel (digital) art.\n\nMany NFTs projects have spawned initiatives that have brought thousands of people together to form a community around them. Users are drawn to these communities because of their unique value and/or usability. For instance, an NFT might be a 1/1 (one-of) version or have characteristics that distinguish it from the other NFTs in the project, making it more valuable.\n\nCommunity NFT Projects provide scarce artwork while also giving value to NFT holders. These utilities can range from real-life events to unique access, voting rights on funding allocation, and anything else that brings utility to the NFT and hence raises its value. In addition, the wallet holder can sell (trade) their NFTs for a higher price to someone who wants to join the community.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nThe communities we've been a part of and the love and passion we've witnessed in NFTs has encouraged us to bring it to the Sydney area. So, in April 2022, we'll be holding the first Premier NFT Sydney event. Educate and support our local community about NFTs and the advantages they can provide is our core mission. \n\n👉 [nftsyd.io](http://nftsyd.io/)\n\n[crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=](crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=)\n\nnft syd, nft sydney , nft community , nft australia", "timestamp": 1654768222, "digest": "G8Qb3cyO5nMn7HAjss9zvHrHd4czetDzBwCKJ2R1t-o", "contributor": "0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4"}

{"id": "GQOs64lRM1jDqb6afp0YEWH02Io0NXZq-Gl9EDR4XIw", "title": "区块链能否撑起元宇宙这片天", "body": "有人讲：Web3世界的尽头是元宇宙。这个观点为加密圈内人所认可。元宇宙的概念其实涵盖了我们的生活、工作与娱乐，是我们整个现实世界到虚拟世界的孪生，反过来又将会对我们的现实世界带来激烈的变革。但是，这片元宇宙的天空太大了，想要撑起来，除了VR/AR，甚至体全息等的视觉与触感，以及5G通讯和AI等技术突破外，实实在在离不开Web3的基石：区块链技术。\n\n区块链能否成为元宇宙的一根擎天柱？它能给元宇宙发展带来什么积极的作用？我们可以关注哪些这方向的区块链技术或领域?\n\n​        在这篇文章里，我们就将围绕这些问题，从元宇宙的概念和方向，以及区块链的现状和技术上，展开研究与分析，希望能为大家解开这些问题的谜团，为我们的投资或研发提供一些帮助。\n\n# 1. 什么是元宇宙？\n\n​        元宇宙，就是人类现实世界到虚拟世界一个投射：\n\n![图1 真实世界到元宇宙的投射](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mkJ9eQvJuckC4yjoPtiQy.png?height=635&width=807)\n\n​        从功能上讲，元宇宙是承载人们虚拟活动的平台，用户可以在其上进行社交、娱乐、创作、展示、教育，以及虚拟资产交易等，这些映射到我们现实世界中社会的、或精神的各方面活动。同时，它会有以下相较现实世界的突出特点：\n\n1. 没有准入门槛。\n2. 基于程序合约的公平性。\n3. 更加可靠的经济系统。\n4. 更加丰富的消费内容。\n\n​        同时，用户通过在元宇宙上进行创作、交易、学习或开会等活动，会与现实世界相结合而产生以下的感受：\n\n1. 沉浸式交互体验。\n2. 情感上的寄托。\n3. 心理上的归属。\n\n​        现在的元宇宙的Web3应用或公司，主要是以游戏为主，或者围绕着游戏而生，比如`Decentraland`、`Roblox`。因此，有人把游戏列为元宇宙的4大支柱技术（显示、通信、区块链与游戏）之一。这点其实是有失偏颇的，因为元宇宙所能承载的将不仅仅是游戏。所以应该是Web3应用，正是由这些应用板块，组成了元宇宙里的社区。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙的本质是要自由可信地承载人们的社交身份和资产权益，以及围绕着这两个的，可与现实世界相映射的所有活动。这些活动体现在元宇宙里，就是一个个Web3的应用。这其实是对现实世界底层逻辑的复制，使得元宇宙成为了一个很好的平台，让任何用户可以在它的上面创建或加入社区，参与创造，而且劳动的成果将得到保障。因此，人们在元宇宙里的劳动、交易与现实中的劳动与交易没有区别：用户在`Dencentraland`里建造的虚拟房子，可以不受平台限制，轻松交易，换成元宇宙甚至现实世界里的物品，其价格将由自由市场决定。\n\n​        上述元宇宙的活动，要比现实世界更加方便与可靠。因为它充分利用了区块链技术的去中心化协议与经济激励规则，通过分布式系统和程序，来保障元宇宙上活动的有序执行，与资产的抗审查确权。\n\n​        但是有人要问了：元宇宙里不管是从现实世界里采样的信息，还是直接在元宇宙里生成的信息，随着元宇宙的繁荣，就要生成现实世界方方面面的数字孪生；这对于区块链来讲，就是超多的交易，超大的数据，现在的区块链，或区块链技术（比如以太坊），能支撑的住吗？\n\n# 2. 元宇宙希望区块链提供哪些支撑？\n\n​        我们先来看看元宇宙当前主要的应用有哪些：\n\n1. 媒体舆情：像VeeR、斗鱼等主要是利用VR+5G的技术，把当下流行Web2的视频点播或VR游戏，简单搬移到了元宇宙上；倒是有个有趣的现象是视频网站从元宇宙的卡通人物里吸取灵感，给主播选换元宇宙头像，在Web2的视频网站上大受欢迎。\n2. 社交游戏：这个是最贴合元宇宙属性的场景，像腾讯就借微信、QQ的用户量在积极拓展元宇宙社交，而网易游戏、米哈游也从游戏角度纷纷杀入元宇宙。\n3. 电商会展：电商直播与电商税收成为国家整治对象，最近的疫情给会展业带来了重创，而元宇宙让电商会展看到新的契机，百度与华为都在这块有着积极的尝试。\n4. 教体文卫：这个也是元宇宙切入比较多的板块，像腾讯就联合敦煌打造元宇宙数字原生NFT，倡导元宇宙游赏敦煌石窟的游玩。\n5. 智能制造：就智能制造本身而言，它是独立的，但我们应该看到，像有些高级制造与高级维修，由于高端师傅的稀缺，因而对于分散的门店或工厂，具有远程指导与治理的真实需求，这个也是与元宇宙相契合的，但我个人只看到一些汽车的后端市场，会用到AR远程指导，还没有真正迁移到元宇宙。\n6. 政治军事：比较容易想到的利用元宇宙的3D仿真城市管理与实战演练了。\n7. 其他应用：除了以上6大类，目前对元宇宙有所涉略的还包括：数字金融、房地产、产业园和农业等。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙所能涵盖的应用或业务，远不至这些，我们大可以从经济、社会、生产、科技、教育和生活诸多方面，展开极限想象：元宇宙里资源无限，因此人们只为快乐而干活；社会将由人治走向法治，再到数学治的转变；从此创意是唯一的技能，什么学这学那的，都不需要，只要保持创造性思维能力就掌握了生产力；在元宇宙的世界里，科技似乎真的有机会触达神灵，因为元宇宙里有不断自我演进的人类智慧；学习的精髓不再是记忆而是遗忘，因为元宇宙会随时帮您记忆，并修正你曾记错的地方；生活真得将变得如此简单，互联网给大家带来的便利有目共睹，元宇宙肯定将让我们世界变得更加方便、更加简单。\n\n​        天下没有免费的午餐，元宇宙是很美好，但它离不开科技，工程，以及底层各技术的框架的支撑。下面是赵国栋老师关于元宇宙的技术框架图：\n\n![1654520381674](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654520381674.png)\n\n​        其中红框处的`去中心化层`就是我们这里所关心的区块链。虽然赵老师这个图很好地表述了元宇宙的架构，但没能清楚地表述区块链的组成，及其层次逻辑，所以我们更乐意用下面一张图来理解元宇宙中的区块链：\n\n![1654528816325](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654528816325.png)\n\n​        这张图是ENChain.Asia的朱峰在BAO的白皮书里第一次提出`自商业`的框架图，它与元宇宙Web3应用的自主经营比较吻合。但该图里还没有很好地体现Web3应用的业务。我们知道，Web3应用其实是由两部分组成的：\n\n1. 后端：也就是运行在区块链网络上的业务处理逻辑。\n2. 前端：也就是我们一般用户看到的Web页面等。\n\n![1654529471702](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654529471702.png)\n\n​        其中淡橙色部分组成了元宇宙Web3应用的业务部分。而后端我们把激励层、治理层、仲裁层和合规层理解为Web3应用在区块链上，基于智能合约的逻辑处理部分，同时，为了适应元宇宙`去中心化自主治理`的业务诉求，还整合进了`自商业` 的逻辑。\n\n​        另外，也有人把区块链比作元宇宙的粘合剂，通过把终端、云计算、AI、大数据与网络相关整合一起，为元宇宙的实现建立起底层的技术基础：\n\n![1654568730044](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654568730044.png)\n\n​        通过上面4张图，我们大体可以理解区块在元宇宙体系里，所处的位置和大概作用。下面我们来进一步分析元宇宙，期望区块链可以提供哪些基础的功能，来支撑它重建一个新世界的远大目标。\n\n​        为了更好地分析，我们把元宇宙关于区块链的诉求，分成一般性需求，和特殊性需求来看。\n\n1. 一般性需求，也就是针对一般Web3应用就需要的。\n2. 特殊性需求，则是元宇宙具体特殊的需求。\n\n​        首先，跑在元宇宙的业务应用肯定也是Web3应用，因此我们可以看到元宇宙，会对区块链提出4类一般性需求：\n\n1. 一种自我激励可靠的去中心化网络，来承载元宇宙的业务。\n2. 一种共识可信的超级账本，来记录元宇宙中活动的点点滴滴。\n3. 一种分布式的不可篡改存储，来确保元宇宙数据的真实性。\n4. 一种基于智能合约的法则，来有效约束各参与方的行为规范。\n\n​        另外，元宇宙作为一个创造新世界的庞大复杂的系统，它应会考虑以下6点，区块链不能成为它的瓶颈：\n\n1. 要能支持几乎无限丰富的应用场景。\n2. 要能支持高并发的交易量。\n3. 要能支持大吞吐的数据量。\n4. 要能与现实世界流畅沟通。\n5. 要能确保隐私。\n6. 商业经营高度自治等。\n\n​        对于一般性需求而言，众所周知，正是区块链技术所擅长的；也正是因为区块链拥有了这些能力，也给了大家想象元宇宙的空间。但元宇宙反过来，则又对区块链提出了更高的要求。下面我们重点关注**区块链可不可能支撑元宇宙的这些更高要求**？\n\n# 3. 区块链能否撑起元宇宙？\n\n## 3.1 不可能三角原则\n\n​        在回答这个问题之前，我们先来认识一下区块链的不可能三角原则。因为它将是我们下面立论的基础。\n\n![1654330699739](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654330699739.png)\n\n​        区块链不可能三角（blockchain trilemma）由以太链创始人Vitalik 提出：也就是说区块链技术不能同时实现去中心化性程度、安全性和高效性。其中：\n\n1. 去中心化是指拥有大量区块生产和验证的节点，一般节点越多，去中心化程度越高。\n2. 安全性是获得网络控制权所要花费的成本，通常在共识机制的设计中锚定现实世界的资产，例如工作量证明机制锚定的是算力。\n3. 高效性就是每秒处理交易的笔数。\n\n​        正是不可能三角原则，使得各种区块链的设计与实现中，只能三者舍其一：要么是确保资本安全，共识基础牢靠；要么是单位吞吐量大，交易费便宜；要么是数据存储技术出众，存储费低廉。这也就导致现在难有一条链，或一种链就可以支撑起元宇宙的特殊需求。\n\n## 3.2 各具特色的区块链\n\n### 3.2.1 大小王\n\n​       首先就是2008年由中本聪发布的`比特币`，它标识了区块链1.0的诞生，一举奠定了区块链的思想与关键技术，是名符其实的区块链大王。比特币带给我们的区块链特征包括：\n\n1. 以区块组成的链条存储交易信息或数据。\n2. 整个区块链网络所共识且共享的超级账本，确保账本的真实性。\n3. 应用了非对称加密算法，通过公钥与私钥结合的方式搭建了区块链的安全防御系统。\n4. 源代码公开，使得区块链网络中设定的共识机制、规则等都可以通过一致的、开源的源代码进行验证。\n5. 贯彻去中心化的思想，包括中本聪到底是何许人也，到现在也不知道（否则中本聪在区块链领域的话语权要比V神大）。\n6. P2P的分布式网络，区块链网络将是去中化的分布式网络。\n\n![1654570644997](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654570644997.png)\n\n​        人们看到，比特币在不可能三角中，特别注重了`去中心化`与`安全`,所以它的TPS特别低，且延时长；而且它脚本类的链上程序不是图灵完备的。虽然区块链1.0比较好地解决了货币发行与支付的去中心化，但应用场景还是很受限。为此区块链的小王以太坊，由Vitalik Buterin于2013年创建，它标识着区块链2.0的诞生。\n\n​        `以太坊`在比特币的基础上，创建了一个图灵完备的虚拟机EVM。因此，人们可以在以太坊上编写智能合约；理论上，可以在该EVM上实现任何复杂的逻辑。为此，Ｖ神在以太坊诞生之初，喊出了以太坊要成为`世界计算机`的口号。\n\n![1654602110810](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654602110810.png)\n\n​        但是以太坊的设计虽然有不少创新，但终究是脱胎于比特币，还是过于关注货币的安全与去中心化，因此它的TPS也不高，而基于智能合约的旺盛业务需求，导致了时常区块爆炸和交易费高昂等诸多问题。\n\n​        不管怎样，由于多年下来，用户没有更好的选择，以太坊业已成为Web3应用开发的首选，和业界标杆。\n\n### 3.2.2 廉价的存储\n\n​        以太坊通过智能合约，解决了市场交易的去中心化。但对用户来讲，这些交易会伴随大量的数据，而且用户也会有需要数据确权存储的需求（这点在元宇宙里将会显得特别突出）。但对于以太坊这类区块链来讲，不是功能上实现不了，而是性能上难以满足：\n\n1. `$10000+/GB年`的费用，让一般用户无法接受。\n2. `13 x 6 = 78s`的延时，让音、视频实时播放类业务只能望而止步。\n\n​        为此，Filecoin与Arweave，抓住这个痛点，纷纷推出了自己的存储区块链，以及配套的服务。我们就以Filecoin为例，来看看它是如何实现高效的数据存储与访问的。\n\n![1653622321102](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1653622321102.png)\n\n​        Filecoin如上图所示，它其实是一个体系，基于区块链的技术，来支持可靠、快速，却又廉价的链上数据存储与访问服务。其中：\n\n1. 右下部分，它实现了Filecoin基础区块链部分：\n\n* 它是标准的P2P区块链网络，但该网络只是负责存储交易及FIL激励相关事务，并不存储用户数据（比如音、视频）；\n* 数据的存储是由该网络上的各个参与节点与用户达成数据存储与访问的deal(这个交易是要上FIlecoin区块链的)，再根据IPFS格式，在节点上封装扇区，并存储数据；但该节点要负责通过ZK技术生成PoRep和PoSt证明，交给Filecoin区块链网络共识。\n\n​        事实上，存储到Filecoin网络上速度也不快，它一般只会做48小时内完成承诺，而且允许超大数据量的存储在链下完成。所以Filecoin网络上的数据存储，也被称作冷存储。\n\n1. 顶上部分，它就是实现的星际文件系统IPFS，以便基于文件的内容，并支持大数据量的存储与访问：\n\n* IPFS也是个P2P的分布式网络，但并不是区块链，因此它上面的活动并不需要共识，只是利用了分布式网络冗余备份功能；\n* 所以IPFS又被称作热存储，在Filecoin体系被用作Cache技术；\n* 但缓存在内存空间不足时很容易被清除，这样会导致用户通过IPFS请求Filecoin的存储服务，很可能会在没有完成冷存储之前，就被清除了；因此在顶部右上角，又增加了一个IPFS PIN Service，来确保用户数据可以在IPFS这个分布式网络里保存足够长的时间。\n\n1. 另一个就是上图右边的`web3.storage`之类的网关服务了，它提供了RPC API，方便用户轻松访问Filecoin网络。\n\n​        可以看到，Filecoin在充分利用区块链技术的同时，还充分结合了链外的以下辅助技术，才得以实现便宜的、支持大吞吐的、安全可信的数据存储与访问的服务：\n\n1. 零知识证明；\n2. 分布式集群；\n3. SaaS网关等。\n\n​        通过Filecoin一组产品体系的设计，它可以在获取不可能三角的去中心化和安全基础上，还获得了链上数据大吞吐访问的高效性。当然，现在大家使用下来，感觉IPFS上数据下载还是慢，这个倒是应该通过增加IPFS集群的并发处理能力，以及Web3.Storage等API网关的网络带宽来解决。\n\n### 3.2.3 突破交易量的瓶颈\n\n​        继了解决大吞吐数据存储方案后，那再来看元宇宙关于支持交易高并发的诉求。我们都知道，比特币原始链和以太链的交易并发数并不多，时延反而长，交易费反而高：\n\n![1654590584969](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654590584969.png)\n\n​        这些弱点，仅让以太坊或比特币来支持元宇宙是不可能的。也正是看到这些弱点，各Layer2扩容方案纷纷出台，或者有的链干脆另起炉灶，完全设计出一条独立的支持高交易量的链：\n\n1. Layer2 扩容方案：它的思想本质就是通过将交易的处理从Layer1的区块链，迁移到了被称Layer2层，并对该处理生成一个证明，而Layer1层只作关于该证明的验证；而验证证明的计算量小很多，从而可以大幅地降低Layer1层区块链的负荷，也就提升了整个区块链业务TPS；当然Layer2层还会用到Sequenser等排序与压缩技术，来进一步提高TPS；目前Layer2的扩容路线主要是Rollup，它能实现Layer1层1\\~2个数量级的扩容。\n\n![1654596595148](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654596595148.png)\n\n1. Layer1独立链交易量的极致突破：它直接让Layer1区块链本身拥有更高的TPS；它往往是以牺牲安全或去中心化来获取更高的单位时间交易量；其中典型的案例有Solana，它的设计中一个时间点只有一个Leader节点出块，而其它的节点只对块中的交易进行验证；因为它的出块，再不是区块链网络里所有节点竞争，所以它会快许多，但显然安全性会下降许多；为此Solana设计了随时间单向的PoH协议，以及TowerBFT协议等，来尽量弥补单个Leader出块中心化不安全的弱点；Solana的TPS可达5万+。\n\n![1649751154101](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1649751154101.png)\n\n​        据Solana白皮书介绍，基于Solana链的交易量瓶颈不再在链本身，而在网络带宽。\n\n### 3.2.4 跨链\n\n​        从前面3个小节的分析，我们确实可以看到，区块链有的去中化程度高，安全可靠，有的可以突破TPS瓶颈，有的则可以很好满足便宜可信大数据量的存储。这些都是元宇宙所需要的。为此，除了独立区块链分布式网络相关的技术外，还需要相关跨链技术，把不同的区块链连接起来，促使它们之间货币信息的流通，甚至可以互操作。对应着这种技术的产品，被大家形象地称为跨链桥。\n\n​        V神把跨链技术的演进和实现方式，总结为3类：\n\n1. 哈希时间锁合约：通过一套密码学方法，来实现不同链上资产的交易；但只能是资产类交易，不能实现资产在不同链上流通，更不能互操作了；下面3张图就显示了基于哈希锁和时间锁，实现将比特币交换成以太的过程：\n\n![1654610756141](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654610756141.png)\n\n![1654610696560](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654610696560.png)\n\n![1654610720888](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654610720888.png)\n\n1. 公证人机制：是由公证人建立一个中间账户，用户将资产转入中间账户，由公证人跨链发行一种映射原Token的影子Token给到用户；当用户需要赎回的时候，将影子Token销毁，并向公证人提供证明，公证人将中间账户的原始Token转到该用户的地址；基于公证人的方案，可以实现资产在不同链，或异构链上流通；但这个流通的可信度，是依赖于这个第三方公证人可信度的。\n2. 桥接链方案：它是当前主流的跨链技术；与公证人方案一样，仍然存在一个中间账户，但中间账户的安全，不靠公证人来保护，而是靠智能合约来规范，这意味着中间账户将是一个合约账户，其资产管理规则被智能合约的代码约束，而不是由公证人约束；如果代码本身没有问题，只要部署该合约的链是安全的，那么合约中的资产就是安全的；像波卡和Cosmos不仅要实现支持资产流通，甚至支持它们同构子链之间的互操作。\n\n​        要说明的一点是：桥接链应搭建在双图灵完备的链间，因为桥接链不是一个独立的存在，而需要部署在两端链上的合约配合，就像一座桥不能悬空存在，必须在两岸有桥墩作为依托一样。\n\n![1654612444169](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654612444169.png)\n\n​        而桥接链方案又可分成3个流派：\n\n1. 通用跨链派：它专注于跨链，旨在实现适配区块链领域存在的所有链，其典型代表是Polygon\n\n![1654652680266](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654652680266.png)\n\n​        上图中的蓝色图标就表示是Polygon。但细心的你会发现它是以`以太坊`为中心的。因为Polygon的目标是`实现一个以太坊兼容链的互联网`。但我们前面讨论了，在元宇宙里，除了以太坊，还需要有诸如Filecoin等的区块链网络；并且对于元宇宙业务应用来讲，尽管以太坊已成为许多人认可的`世界记账机`，也不一定就是中心（区块链应该排斥中心的）。\n\n1. 引流跨链派：它往往是Layer1的独立链，需要借用以太坊更丰富的货币体系，以及引流以太坊上大量的免教育用户，其典型代表有Solana Wormhole\n\n![1654654191766](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654654191766.png)\n\n​        Wormhole在以太坊与Solana之间，搭建一条双向、去中心化的 ERC-20⇄SPL 代币桥。Solana主打的这条`trustless`桥，让以太坊的DeFi交易者和应用，在两条链上进行资产转换，并享受Solana的高TPS和低转账成本的服务；而且基于Wormhole，开发者可以继续使用之前为以太坊编写的智能合约。细心的你有可能发现上图左下角的`Terra`作为Luna的基础链，已经崩了；这里还选用这张图，主要是想警示大家，在通过跨链技术，连接不同区块链时，注意链想到之间产生`连环雪崩`灾害；这是元宇宙安全所在，由于安全问题不在是本篇文章的重点，就不展开了。\n\n1. 互操作跨链流派：它不仅要实现不同链之间代币的流通，更专注于链之间的`互操作`,链之间真正的互联互通，其典型代表有Polkadot最新发布的XCM\n\n![1654656833460](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654656833460.png)\n\n​        XCM是波卡的跨共识消息格式（Cross-Consensus Messaging format）的简称，XCM不仅支持链之间的通信，还支持智能合约、Dapp和Substrate pallet（模块）之间的通信，从而实现了不同链之间的消息传递，与类似RPC调用的互操作。但我们也应看到：XCM不能用于在系统之间实际“发送”任何消息，它的效用只在于表达接收者应该做什么；XCM是消息格式，需要搭配消息传递协议使用，才能完成消息的跨链。还有就是，XCM只适用于Polkadot家族中的平行链之间的跨链。\n\n​        通过上面的分析我们可以知道，由于不同链之间的共识机制，所有虚拟机和智能合约架构的不同，链之间的互联互通，还是有不少难度。但经过不同厂商的努力，我们也看到现在的跨链桥技术，已基本可以将不同的功能的区块链技术捏合在一起，来打破区块链的不可能三角，从而满足以元宇宙既要去中心化，又要安全，还要高效的诉求。\n\n​        另注：跨链桥这块，作者推荐大家关注Polkadot与Cosmos之类专注链互操作的区块链体系。因为它们理论上可以构建各种功能和特色的链，而且这些链在同一体系下，在设计之初，就充分考虑了跨链互联的需求。\n\n## 3.3 满足不可能三角之后呢？\n\n​        通过3.2节的分析，我们知道，基于跨链桥技术，可以将具有不同功能与特色的链连接起来，从而使得不可能三角的安全性、去中心化和高效性的三者兼得。但元宇宙的特殊需求尚不止于此。\n\n### 3.3.1 可用不可见的隐私计算\n\n​        元宇宙尽管是个虚拟世界，但其中还是关联到现实生活中的，会附带着各种数字资产，以及大量的个人隐私信息。所以在元宇宙里往往会采用DID（去中心化的身份证），来绑定用户在元宇宙里的身份，并进而把与之相关的资产和数据归之名下。\n\n​        这个小节我们主要谈谈用户链上数据隐私保护的问题。我们可以发现以下几点前提：\n\n1. 首先，这些数据要是为元宇宙所有用户认可的，所以数据就应存放在去中心化的区块链网络上，比如Filecoin。\n2. 为了保护隐私，这些数据应是加密存储，只有用户自身才能读取其中的内容。\n3. 但这些隐私数据如果元宇宙不能使用，那就无法提取该用户的相关属性，也难以为该用户提供更好的服务。\n\n![1654734630484](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654734630484.png)\n\n​        如上图，`元宇宙渔业监管部门`需要监查`元宇宙渔船`是否超出了捕捞海域，需要渔船的`元宇宙海域坐标`；渔船认为该坐标信息是它的隐私，不便提供；而监管部门没有坐标是没有办法监管。因此现实世界里，只能由监管部门强制收取，最后由于职权部门的泄密，导致个人安全或利益受损，个人往往也只能认倒霉。\n\n​        我们知道，数据的处理包括三个环节：传输、存储与计算。其中，传输、存储的安全已有相关技术，但数据的`安全计算`一直没有一条通用性的方案，也就是讲，现有的数据安全计算方案，往往只能应用于特定的场景。我们对数据安全计算的目标，主要定位在`数据可用不可见`上，所以又将数据安全计算，称为`隐私计算`。由于数据已成为最重要的生产资料，隐私计算将显得越来越重要。当前的主要的隐私计算技术分类有：\n\n![1654737108366](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654737108366.png)\n\n​        基于以上分析，元宇宙也是需要隐私计算的技术，来确保用户隐私数据的`可用不可见`；而且为了节约网络带宽资源，实现的隐私计算功能模块，**应当贴近区块链端**。其中`零知识证明`技术，已在区块链里被广泛使用。前面我们提到过，像Filecoin里的PoRep与PoSt就利用了零知识证明。但这项技术只能证明数据存储行为本身，并不能从该数据里抽取有用的属性，比如渔船越界了。为此，在元宇宙里，还应充分利用`联邦学习`，`可信执行环境`等技术，并把它们有机结合起来：\n\n1. 搭建`联邦学习`等AI计算集群，提供支持保护隐私的神经网络训练与预判环境，为元宇宙提供类似人工智能感知层，但这个感知是去中心化的。\n2. 搭建可信执行环境，由于该环境需要支持AI的训练与计算，所以元宇宙里的可信执行环境是服务器集群级别，与手机和安全卡之类的可信执行环境，在物理上不是一个量级。\n\n​        其是在元宇宙里联邦学习集群与可信执行环境集群，可以合二为一，形成一种类似`PaaS`的服务。作者认为，这应该是元宇宙的一项基础构件，像元宇宙中社区自治（DAO）中，特别倚重的声誉系统，没有AI，没有确保隐私的AI，学习性、公正性、有效性就难以保证。想要建立元宇宙的良性生态，不妨先把这个基础服务做起来。如果您看好元宇宙，这将是一块真正的`busyness`。但目前似乎少有企业或组织，真正把它当作业务，或者以PaaS、BaaS的眼光来看待它。\n\n### 3.3.2 Oracle沟通物理世界\n\n​        通过3.3.1小节的讨论，我们通过采用多种隐私计算技术，可以保障元宇宙中用户个体数据的隐私安全。但如果区块链相以支撑起元宇宙，我们认为尚有不足，因为元宇宙不仅仅是现实世界的搬迁，它还需要与物理世界的交流与互动。像海尔在组建的元宇宙工厂，如不与现实工厂相关联，对海尔来讲是没有意义的。\n\n​        元宇宙与物理世界的交互，其实就是物理世界信息要更新到元宇宙的区块链网络中，而区块链网络处理的结果，应该反映到现实中去。这种交互，就需要所谓的Oracle技术（预言机）。该技术在DeFi里使用比较多，其中典型的代表就是Chainlink。\n\n![1654740248826](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654740248826.png)\n\n​        它的工作机制是：\n\n```\n  1. Chainlink构成了一个去中心化的分布式网络，并通过Oracle合约与以太坊等区块链锚定。\n  2. 用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Adapter服务；该服务会从不物理信源处采集所需要的信息，比如各DEX关于LINK Token的价格，进行汇总，并根据用户的喜好采用这些信息，调用Oracle合约，自动触发相关的链上交易。\n  3. 链上的逻辑处理完好，又可以调用Oracle合约，将信息返回给Chainlink网络；用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Initiator服务；该服务根据Oracle返回的信息，再触发现实世界的相关交易。\n```\n\n​        元宇宙与现实世界的沟通，也需要诸如Chainlink之类的Oracle技术：使得两个世界息息相生。\n\n### 3.3.3 DAO\n\n​        经过上面的分析，我们就来看看最后一个点：那就是元宇宙的商业自治。这个诉求与区块链的DAO是极其吻合的。\n\n![1654742945289](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654742945289.png)\n\n​        DAO是指去中心化自治组织，它伴随区块链而诞生，并一经出现，就热度不减。因为它有以下鲜明的特点：\n\n1. 去中心化、自动化和透明，所有要遵守的规则都由链上公开的智能合约来定。\n2. 社区驱动，规则的决定与调整，也就是组织的决策权，赋予社区里所有的代币持有者，由大家投票裁决；往往这种权力是与社员持有代币量成正比；因而让社区成为利益休戚相关且真正民主。\n3. 具有潜在的投资回报，DAO中所持有的治理代币，正如初创公司早期持有的股权：后面一旦成功，这些代币会非常有价值。\n\n​        这里，我们应将DAO的治理代币，与区块链的原生代币区别开来。原生代币是区块链网络为了维护其网络生态繁荣的经济激励措施而发行，从某种意义上讲，是存在类似`货币超发`现象，或讲超前消费嫌疑。而DAO的治理代币，它应是绑定在社区实际的成长上的：只有社区有价值，它的治理代币才会有价值。当然，不可否认，DAO的治理代币也起着经济激励的基础作用，如第2章中的7层架构中的`激励层`所示，它将给予社区美好的预期，促进社区成员，为着共同的目标一起努力。这点是与元宇宙的自商业完全一致。\n\n​        但是，我们也要看到DAO的一个致命的弱点：什么事都要靠投票来决定。这样，当有问题时，特别是重大紧急问题时，也要通过投票解决？2016年以太坊的`The Dao`事故，仍然历历在目。以太坊的做法是人为干涉，但这又与去中心化思想相悖，从而为人所诟病，并由此导致了以太坊的硬分叉。所以，元宇宙在社区自治过程中，还应设计好此类事件的应对方案。\n\n# 4. 结论\n\n​        元宇宙还有很长的路要走，但它美好的前景，值得Facebook去投入，也值我们所有人去追寻。元宇宙少不了区块链，这点已为业界共识。同时，从上面的分析来看，通过组合不同的区块链，以及隐私计算等相关技术，是有机会支撑起元宇宙的各类应用，以及对大家对元宇宙未来的畅想。\n\n​        当然，区块链相关的技术还有待发展，这也何尝不是机会。作者认为，我们可以重点关注：\n\n1. 开放式的跨链桥技术，将元宇宙需要的各种链有机、灵活地连接起来。\n2. 集成联邦学习与可信执行环境集群的BaaS服务。\n3. 具有通识基础的元宇宙声誉系统，打造元宇宙的DAO，建立基于`数字治`的良序公约。", "timestamp": 1654768558, "digest": "hYOaJFFtLrlJ3_CSClzJo_hAwKYb9-6w6dwK1_WaLQM", "contributor": "0x8fB6C85590aC6fFd0Dc31A95800C084F2DaAb5fe"}

{"id": "vJIpknY2k9snr_Y-sTO-ebJWki_bcP1iNGm5K7x0ajU", "title": "日拱一卒：Stepn 项目反思", "body": "### 写在最前面\n\n其实我这篇文章写了几天了，一直纠结着没发出来。但后来想了想，还是发出来，因为这个总结不是为了别的，是为了反思和提高。\n\n我们为什么要反思？就是为了改进，让自己下一次不会再犯之前的错误。能改的，叫做缺点，不能改的，叫做弱点。\n\n所以，有效的总结是这次的经验可以应用到下一次，否则如果这样，我知道自己这次做不好，但是我下次还是继续没进步，这样就属于自我欺骗的总结，给自己营造一种幻觉，觉得自己可以赚到，应该赚到，但实际上，这对以后的操作毫无帮助。\n\n### 正式开始\n\n从 5 月 25 号开始，不管是参与者还是项目方，都经历了一段至暗时刻。从某种意义上说，这不是坏事，只有经历过一些至暗时刻，个人或公司才能成长的更好，几乎没有个体或公司可以在一帆风顺的情况下发展壮大。\n\n最近很多人也在总结得失，我一直在整理自己的思路，今天把我的总结分享出来，以期待自己在以后的投资中可以做的更好。\n\n在互联网公司有个 retrospect，经常会总结一段时间项目的得失，主要聚焦在三点：做的好的、做的不好的、有待改进的。做得好的这里可以忽略，主要我会总结做的不好的以及有待改进的。重要的是成功的经验是否可以复制，失败的地方以后能否避免，自己的经验能否给他人提供可借鉴的地方。而不是去嘚瑟自己的收益或者哭诉自己的失败博取同情。\n\n在我这段时间观察，市场上的人群可以分为三类，当然不一定准，只是我个人的想法：\n\n* 有经验的投资者，他们不在乎项目怎么样，或者不是那么在乎，他们在乎的是这个项目自己赚到钱没有。\n* 有一点理想主义的 Web3 参与者，他们某种意义上更在意项目的长期发展，会从各个角度给项目方出谋划策，让项目可以继续发展下去\n* 跟风者，这类人是情绪指标的观察标的，对项目没什么研究，想赚大钱，但不愿研究，对项目的转变态度非常之快，赚到钱的时候是小甜甜，亏钱的时候就是项目方就是个割韭菜的。他们赚钱时候不会感谢项目，亏钱的时候必然把项目方骂的狗血淋头，却不会从自己身上找原因。\n\n所以，如果想让自己做的更好，要跟第一类人学习如何在各类项目赚钱，但是最好也保持一点理想主义，然后观察第三类人，时刻提醒自己不要成为第三类人。\n\n### 我个人的总结\n\n我之前总结过一次，提到我虽然是早期的参与者，但是收益没有想象中的高。主要原因之一是对很多玩法后来失去了敏感。特别是 BNB 链的 mint 流，我一开始一直觉得贵，然后觉得再搞一个助记词有点麻烦，一直拖到我的空投鞋子到了，才补了另外一双去研究 mint 流。我根本没去研究为何双方差价这么大，里面的风险和利润在哪里。我应该如何参与。\n\n教训一：对于项目里推荐的新玩法，一定要第一时间去研究，根据自己的风险偏好，制定自己的参与策略（甚至不参与也是一直策略，但是你要研究，要知道不参与的逻辑，而不是一无所知的不参与）。\n\n教训二：心态开放，不要在没做任何研究之前给投资标的贴标签，不要先入为主。\n\n然后关于回本，首先，我确实是回本了，但是在 BNB狂热的时候，我也贪婪了，没有及时收割利润，加上 5.25 宣布的 7.15deadline，导致回吐很多。具体过程是怎样的呢，就是我在研究明白 mint 流之后，觉得这太香了，香到我有点冲昏头脑，然后有些母鞋没及时出手，想着多卖一点，或者多 mint 一次，然后忘记了风险，且没有做任何对冲。当然，部分利润，我去布局了 BSCPAD 和 STG，算是弥补了一点。\n\n教训三：风险控制第一，也就是管理好自己的仓位。先胜而后战，君子不立危墙之下。尤其是在家人参与的情况下，先回本，或者把风险控制在一个合适的范围（这个范围因人而异）。\n\n我最近其实看了很多复盘反思，也看到了一些原因比如是轻视，比如是自己懒，这种其实是给自己营造一种幻觉，你应该反思的不是这类原因，就像之前有人说这个错过了，我们去找下一个，那怎么就能保证下一个可以抓住？\n\n最近还看到，当我们每次危机之后回头看，市场其实给了我们很多次机会，尤其是几乎每一次大的危机出现之后，别的不说，就是 luna走向归零的那段时间，其实也让很多人赚了很多。但是问题来了，为什么大多数人危机是亏钱？\n\n### 接下来我的做法\n\n* 我对项目还是很看好，但是有很多事情我也无法决定。所以我的抉择会在月底左右。先说最差的情况，我也会保留创世、第一双万能、绿鞋以及空投的鞋子。\n* 每天继续走路，现在每天自己走完 40左右能量。继续听诸多音频，特别是财经类、历史类。\n* 看书、学习，继续研究新的项目。\n* 继续反思，看看Stepn 里的经验教训如何应用到下一个项目。\n\n### 关于对三类人的解读\n\n为了不引起误解，在这里先说明一下，第一类和第二类完全可能是重合的，即使真的没有重合，也没有对任何一类不敬的意思，我唯一希望大家不要做第三类人。\n\n关于第一类，作为成熟的投资者，这一类是大家努力成为的目标。昨天看了晓哥的总结，确实是一个很厉害的投资者。经晓哥允许，以下引用自晓哥的原话，在此表示感谢。\n\n> 我只是说，来这个市场，是为了赚钱的。想赚钱，心态就得开放。不要随意地贴上一个标签，简单地批判某个项目是什么骗局或空气。也不要简单地对某个项目有信仰，动不动就革命，理想，伟大，潜力。投资也不要太拘泥于所谓的正统，价值，投资或投机。也不要静态地去看一个项目，一个不看好的烂项目起点很差，但莫名其妙就做到市值很大，比如狗狗和屎币。有的明星项目分分钟就跨了，比如 EOS 和Luna 。形势变了，认知和决策马上跟着变。随时打脸，随时认错，随时跟进。\n\n> 想在市场上赚钱，思维的焦点其实根本不是给项目定一个性，它是革命还是骗局。而是类似于“它这个项目的成长逻辑是什么？”“有没有迎合行业的下一波炒作热点？”“里面有没有什么可赚钱的机会？”“风险有多大？”“应该建多少仓位?建仓的节奏怎么把握？”“建仓和减仓的触发条件是什么？”“出现什么信号我就应该跑多少仓位？”等等\n\n> 赚钱还是亏钱。不取决于这个项目的定性，而取决于你的对策。你说的死亡螺旋，走下坡路，或者之前很多人说的什么旁氏。其实都是一种认知。从认知到决策，有巨大的鸿沟。就拿大饼来说，不管看多大饼还是看空大饼，都同样有人赚到很多钱。这具体都是要看怎么做的。将思考的时间和焦点多放在对策上，而不是认知和预测上，赚钱的概率会更高。\n\n> 很多人投资的操作上实际是非常粗糙的，基本上就是看涨我就加仓，看跌我就减仓。项目好我就加仓，项目不好我就减仓清仓。他的操作全部建立在对于涨跌和项目好坏的预测上，所以会在选币和择时上耗费大量的功夫。问题在于，涨跌和选币本身就是充满高度的不确定性的，投入更多的资源和时间并不一定能消除这种不确定性。这也就是很多人炒币吃不香睡不踏实的原因，减仓怕踏空，加仓怕被套。这是个无底洞。真正的解决方案可能得把短板补一补，考虑一下怎样将投资决策建立在这种不确定性的基础上，就是我预测行情涨跌可能是错的，选币也经常会看走眼的，那么这个概率有多大，风险几何。怎样才能控制这个风险敞口，获得风险收益。\n\n关于第二类，在我总结之前，先插播一个小故事。大家应该都度过《明朝那些事儿》，其中对我震撼最大的一段是\n\n> **这就是我想通过徐霞客所表达的，足以藐视所有王侯将相，最完美的结束语：成功只有一个——按照自己的方式，去度过人生。**\n\n这段时间快走(jogger)的时候，听了很多音频，特别是历史类的音频，感想颇多，我们到底从历史中学会了什么？为什么一些事情还是一再重复发生？还是因为我们都是不能超越自己的欲望和弱点。\n\n> 无论这个世界有多绝望，你自己都要充满希望。\n\n> 人生并非如某些人所说，很短暂，事实上，有时候，它很漫长，特别是对苦难中的人，漫长得想死。\n\n> 但我坚持，无论有多绝望，无论有多悲哀，每天早上起来，都要对自己说，这个世界很好，很强大。\n\n> 这句话，不是在满怀希望光明时说的，很绝望、很无助、很痛苦、很迷茫的时候，说这句话。\n\n> 要坚信，你是一个勇敢的人。\n\n> 因为你还活着，活着，就要继续前进。\n\n以上，转自《明朝那些事儿》，送给 Stepn，送给还在坚持的 Stepn 小伙伴，送给自己。", "timestamp": 1654768544, "digest": "SMaU6qBuvBbzlsmcjqZF_NxI14ZWhHlaj_E2DP3hGY4", "contributor": "0xDdd54D4D71FF9AD625D8e90DC6DdEafEeB5632Ba"}

I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654768937, "digest": "58-fqpvgoNOVx14Dui5jokK6gmjACcJW9i_mrd61FTw", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}
{"id": "IoMuaIi4xrM2BkMRxwPOgY49S9RFF7NP4Z6VsIIQxx0", "title": "踏入 NFT 的“后现代主义”：ill poop it nft和 ShitBeast", "body": "截止到2022年6月8日，ill poop it nft和ShitBeast已经占据了OpenSea的七天交易量的第7名和第8名。ill poop it nft和ShitBeast均出自同一团队，他们所打造的shit系列到底带来了怎样的市场影响，爆火背后的原因又是什么呢？\n\n![7日NFT交易量排行榜（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aHIN7jismzhw9tRgcpaJ9.png?height=876&width=1280)\n\n## 市场影响\n\n### 起源\n\n6月1日，项目方发行了 **ill poop it nft**，总量10,000个，采用free mint的形式**。**该NFT画风极其另类，元素主体为一坨屎，并带有其他NFT的照片。同时，左上角还挂着一块招牌，上面写着一些极具嘲讽的话语，如“Fucking interviews still going on in Web 3 huh?”。该社区没有Discord，仅有Twitter进行关键信息的发布，路线图上也是开玩笑的段子，所以一眼看去像是一个蹭流量的项目，一开始大家也只是在社交媒体上调侃市场上出现“一坨屎的NFT”。\n\n![ ill poop it nft展示图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iedmxRM9XmqL-qXbmuo5t.png?height=317&width=1280)\n\n### ill poop it nft\n\n在开放free mint后，**ill poop it nft** 地板价一路涨到了 0.28e，之后开始逐渐下跌，并在6月4号最低跌到0.015e，跌幅高达94%。正当大家都以为这只是一个昙花一现的项目时，6月5号 ill poop it nft 地板价再次拉升到0.37e，并在6月6号突破新高达到了0.57e。\n\n![ill poop it nft 价格走势图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rMLRtQsfJ47H9ZrTBKvuz.png?height=428&width=1280)\n\n从下图流通量上我们可以看出，6月1号和6月5号是该NFT交易的密集期；结合持有者和交易者的情况，我们发现ill poop it nft在6月5号经过了大量换手，目前交易量逐渐放缓，售卖者也开始大幅变少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mn6tiPhjDb6ixt1GOnMth.png?height=452&width=1280)\n\n### ShitBeast\n\n与此同时，官方推出的第二代NFT ShitBeast开始接替ill poop it nft的成交量，并在6月6日冲到日内交易量第二位，仅次于BAYC。\n\n![ ill poop it nft和ShitBeast交易量对比图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yi6CovGSleDmwROXOhEj8.png?height=579&width=1280)\n\nShitBeast的地板价自发售以来一直在逐步爬升，从6月5日的mint价格0.06e涨到6月8日的0.59e，涨幅已经高达883%，最高一笔以8.88e成交。\n\n![ShitBeast地板价走势图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xvU9ZXlnXT7yJKVSSQenq.png?height=434&width=1280)\n\n在持有人方面，ShitBeast的巨鲸持有人逐渐增多。目前蓝筹持有人为317个，其中224人为Other deed持有者占总比例的6.04%，相比之下，第一代ill poop it nft 的蓝筹持有人为148个，其中Otherdeed持有者占到7.02%，同一个项目的发行第二代NFT的蓝筹持有人比第一代更多。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3IYqfMcmG5T3hjKGf4ILg.png?height=518&width=1049)\n\n![蓝筹持有人及比例（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/blSzVFeWJsQIl1YMblrUj.png?height=547&width=1052)\n\n![ShitBeast前5名的收益均在$100,000以上（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fP0ApEAn2EbYHkhupVej0.png?height=398&width=1280)\n\n### ShitPlunger\n\n此外，6月7号项目方空投给Genesis ShitBeast的ShitPlunger，采用了ERC1155协议，发售后不到24小时价格涨到了0.478e，目前交易量也在逐步上升，并保持比较活跃的状态。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5fu_RDS7MtyEYmx6W3Y8.png?height=579&width=777)\n\n![ShitPlunger交易信息（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DslwBNOPJ5z3bYbSV6Quo.png?height=426&width=1280)\n\n# 推动价格的原因\n\n从上文可知，6月5号是交易的密集区，我们回到这一天，项目方开放了官网，宣布进入第二阶段，并公布了第二代NFT——ShitBeast。\n\n### 通缩\n\n从官方透露的信息可以知道该ShitBeast分为两个级别。第一种为Genesis ShitBeast，共3095个，用户可以选择将两个ill poop it nft合成一个Genesis ShitBeast；第二种是普通级别的ShitBeast，共6095个，用户可以在官网直接mint，价格为0.06e。\n\n按照Genesis ShitBeast全部合成计算下来，将需要销毁6190个ill poop it nft，因此ill poop it nft数量会越来越少，这可能就是ill poop it nft价格急速拉升的第一个原因。\n\n### 空投\n\n由两个ill poop it nft合成的Genesis ShitBeast还可以获得10,000,00,000的$SHIT空投。没错，距离第一代NFT发行不到一周，除了增发第二代NFT，他们甚至又发行了ERC 20的$SHIT，并上线了MEXC交易所，$SHIT又是一波价格的拉升，这直接引起了人们的大范围讨论，引爆了相关话题。\n\n![$SHIT价格走势图（数据来源：mexc.com）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mMCkNhRraUY7wQiI3p0Sq.png?height=665&width=1280)\n\n### 再次通缩\n\n6月5号，官方推特再次暗示将发行名为ShitPlunger的NFT，并公布了新的玩法，称通过ShitPlunger，人们可以将他们的ShitBeast进化成第三代NFT，ShitPlunger有两种方式可以获得，一是拥有Genesis ShitBeast将直接获得ShitPlunger空投，二是通过$SHIT可以进行购买ShitPlunger。不仅为没有合成ShitBeast的poop提供了新的赋能，引发fomo情绪，也为第二代 ShitBeast 创造了通缩机制，同时$SHIT也具有了购买力，完成了一次赋能，可谓一箭三雕。\n\n![ShitDeployer发售的NFT（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j6ocU0E8e3WlvCn487Nfa.png?height=579&width=1280)\n\n### 运营特点\n\n从项目方发布的信息，我们可以看出整个系列分为三个阶段，并对应发布三种NFT，即第一代ill poop it nft、第二代ShitBeast，第三代尚未得知，在推特上我们发现这样一幅图——项目方暗示即将到来的第三代NFT。从画风中，该NFT很明显是“Shit→ShitBeast→ShitMan”的养成路线，项目方在每个阶段之间用通缩的机制进行串联，比如：2个ill poop it nft→1个ShitBeast，1个ShitBeast+1个ShitPlunger→1个ShitMan。这样持有人将自己的老NFT不断换为新NFT，完成价值转移，而老NFT则会通过销毁变得稀缺。\n\n![Shit→ShitBeast→ShitMan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sAbEL58pP48NdFtxZiI4d.png?height=448&width=1456)\n\n除此之外，项目方在不停和其他NFT进行联动，比如在Murakami.Flowers将要空投时发布推文，暗示持有ill poop it nft和Murakami.Flowers将会有$SHIT空投，基本上延续了ill poop it nft的“碰瓷”文化，推特的运营则把一些知名的NFT都当做自己的引流对象，不停地进行引用和讽刺，在文案和图画制作上也比较有针对性，来引起人们的情绪共鸣。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BTeXTeb5Fn2QCIVEqQojh.png?height=1072&width=1174)\n\n![一些推文（来源：Twitter）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C41DeGDLIdVWxkJwXCvVu.png?height=855&width=956)\n\n除了风格，我们看到项目方的行动非常专业且迅速，短短七天发布3个系列的NFT，并熟练应用ERC20、ERC721、ERC1155来配合不同的运营路径，不仅通过激励留住了早期持有者，也不断地开放入口让新人可以找到自己的参与的方式。\n\n# NFT的后现代主义\n\n在某种程度上，艺术，文学，音乐是互通的，而处于一个新兴赛道的 NFT 的，其发展无形中走过了“现实主义”，“现代主义”，再到如今的“后现代主义”阶段。\n\n在 NFT 早期阶段，NFT 的发展依旧依托于艺术和艺术家本身，着眼于艺术所塑造和刻画的本质，比如Beeple。慢慢地，随着 BAYC，Doodles等项目的诞生，NFT成为创作，身份和社区的多种代表，而部分人在交易的同时依旧关注其实用性，路线图，社区价值和美学精神。但同时，NFT PFP的热潮不乏代表了一种属于21世纪的反叛精神和运动。\n\n而如今，随着ill poop it nft和Goblin.wtf等项目的出现，NFT 本身更有一种自我否定，讽刺和质疑的精神。加之当前的市场行情，审美的维度得到了重述，人们用奇怪符号和简单的形式进行自我表达。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hao-EKMSuIkmJOWRH1Ogm.png?height=506&width=1201)\n\n“Your NFT is just a piece of shit.”这背后或许说明了，NFT其实没有任何使命和实用，只是大家的集体消遣。所有一切都是转瞬即逝的，虚无的，就像是你手中的 NFT。\n\n# 结语\n\n熊市到了现在，市场突然涌现出一批以“丑、恶、怪”为特点的NFT，这样一股“泥石流”的冲击，不禁让人们怀疑NFT的价值到底与何种共识对应，也许是因为人们对于目前市场的不满，大部分NFT都处于亏损的状态，这时poop NFT对一些NFT的讽刺正好引起了人们共鸣，存在着一部分情绪上的共识。随着ShitDeployer不停地升级玩法，屠龙少年是否也会成为恶龙呢？让我们持续观察。", "timestamp": 1654768938, "digest": "icQORRTfSP-M5DVbIkM0ZomIr9YGmes8iQ0ShmOn_Ag", "contributor":

I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654768969, "digest": "58-fqpvgoNOVx14Dui5jokK6gmjACcJW9i_mrd61FTw", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}

{"id": "GtbIuBj-dXB4iD2f2_EJF9xU3sWk38Yvd5PvzIHLSxs", "title": "踏入 NFT 的“后现代主义”：ill poop it nft和 ShitBeast", "body": "截止到2022年6月8日，ill poop it nft和ShitBeast已经占据了OpenSea的七天交易量的第7名和第8名。ill poop it nft和ShitBeast均出自同一团队，他们所打造的shit系列到底带来了怎样的市场影响，爆火背后的原因又是什么呢？\n\n![7日NFT交易量排行榜（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aHIN7jismzhw9tRgcpaJ9.png?height=876&width=1280)\n\n## 市场影响\n\n### 起源\n\n6月1日，项目方发行了 **ill poop it nft**，总量10,000个，采用free mint的形式\\*\\*。\\*\\*该NFT画风极其另类，元素主体为一坨屎，并带有其他NFT的照片。同时，左上角还挂着一块招牌，上面写着一些极具嘲讽的话语，如“Fucking interviews still going on in Web 3 huh?”。该社区没有Discord，仅有Twitter进行关键信息的发布，路线图上也是开玩笑的段子，所以一眼看去像是一个蹭流量的项目，一开始大家也只是在社交媒体上调侃市场上出现“一坨屎的NFT”。\n\n![ ill poop it nft展示图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iedmxRM9XmqL-qXbmuo5t.png?height=317&width=1280)\n\n### ill poop it nft\n\n在开放free mint后，**ill poop it nft** 地板价一路涨到了 0.28e，之后开始逐渐下跌，并在6月4号最低跌到0.015e，跌幅高达94%。正当大家都以为这只是一个昙花一现的项目时，6月5号 ill poop it nft 地板价再次拉升到0.37e，并在6月6号突破新高达到了0.57e。\n\n![ill poop it nft 价格走势图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rMLRtQsfJ47H9ZrTBKvuz.png?height=428&width=1280)\n\n从下图流通量上我们可以看出，6月1号和6月5号是该NFT交易的密集期；结合持有者和交易者的情况，我们发现ill poop it nft在6月5号经过了大量换手，目前交易量逐渐放缓，售卖者也开始大幅变少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mn6tiPhjDb6ixt1GOnMth.png?height=452&width=1280)\n\n### ShitBeast\n\n与此同时，官方推出的第二代NFT ShitBeast开始接替ill poop it nft的成交量，并在6月6日冲到日内交易量第二位，仅次于BAYC。\n\n![ ill poop it nft和ShitBeast交易量对比图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yi6CovGSleDmwROXOhEj8.png?height=579&width=1280)\n\nShitBeast的地板价自发售以来一直在逐步爬升，从6月5日的mint价格0.06e涨到6月8日的0.59e，涨幅已经高达883%，最高一笔以8.88e成交。\n\n![ShitBeast地板价走势图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xvU9ZXlnXT7yJKVSSQenq.png?height=434&width=1280)\n\n在持有人方面，ShitBeast的巨鲸持有人逐渐增多。目前蓝筹持有人为317个，其中224人为Other deed持有者占总比例的6.04%，相比之下，第一代ill poop it nft 的蓝筹持有人为148个，其中Otherdeed持有者占到7.02%，同一个项目的发行第二代NFT的蓝筹持有人比第一代更多。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3IYqfMcmG5T3hjKGf4ILg.png?height=518&width=1049)\n\n![蓝筹持有人及比例（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/blSzVFeWJsQIl1YMblrUj.png?height=547&width=1052)\n\n![ShitBeast前5名的收益均在$100,000以上（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fP0ApEAn2EbYHkhupVej0.png?height=398&width=1280)\n\n### ShitPlunger\n\n此外，6月7号项目方空投给Genesis ShitBeast的ShitPlunger，采用了ERC1155协议，发售后不到24小时价格涨到了0.478e，目前交易量也在逐步上升，并保持比较活跃的状态。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5fu_RDS7MtyEYmx6W3Y8.png?height=579&width=777)\n\n![ShitPlunger交易信息（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DslwBNOPJ5z3bYbSV6Quo.png?height=426&width=1280)\n\n# 推动价格的原因\n\n从上文可知，6月5号是交易的密集区，我们回到这一天，项目方开放了官网，宣布进入第二阶段，并公布了第二代NFT——ShitBeast。\n\n### 通缩\n\n从官方透露的信息可以知道该ShitBeast分为两个级别。第一种为Genesis ShitBeast，共3095个，用户可以选择将两个ill poop it nft合成一个Genesis ShitBeast；第二种是普通级别的ShitBeast，共6095个，用户可以在官网直接mint，价格为0.06e。\n\n按照Genesis ShitBeast全部合成计算下来，将需要销毁6190个ill poop it nft，因此ill poop it nft数量会越来越少，这可能就是ill poop it nft价格急速拉升的第一个原因。\n\n### 空投\n\n由两个ill poop it nft合成的Genesis ShitBeast还可以获得10,000,00,000的$SHIT空投。没错，距离第一代NFT发行不到一周，除了增发第二代NFT，他们甚至又发行了ERC 20的$SHIT，并上线了MEXC交易所，$SHIT又是一波价格的拉升，这直接引起了人们的大范围讨论，引爆了相关话题。\n\n![$SHIT价格走势图（数据来源：mexc.com）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mMCkNhRraUY7wQiI3p0Sq.png?height=665&width=1280)\n\n### 再次通缩\n\n6月5号，官方推特再次暗示将发行名为ShitPlunger的NFT，并公布了新的玩法，称通过ShitPlunger，人们可以将他们的ShitBeast进化成第三代NFT，ShitPlunger有两种方式可以获得，一是拥有Genesis ShitBeast将直接获得ShitPlunger空投，二是通过$SHIT可以进行购买ShitPlunger。不仅为没有合成ShitBeast的poop提供了新的赋能，引发fomo情绪，也为第二代 ShitBeast 创造了通缩机制，同时$SHIT也具有了购买力，完成了一次赋能，可谓一箭三雕。\n\n![ShitDeployer发售的NFT（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j6ocU0E8e3WlvCn487Nfa.png?height=579&width=1280)\n\n### 运营特点\n\n从项目方发布的信息，我们可以看出整个系列分为三个阶段，并对应发布三种NFT，即第一代ill poop it nft、第二代ShitBeast，第三代尚未得知，在推特上我们发现这样一幅图——项目方暗示即将到来的第三代NFT。从画风中，该NFT很明显是“Shit→ShitBeast→ShitMan”的养成路线，项目方在每个阶段之间用通缩的机制进行串联，比如：2个ill poop it nft→1个ShitBeast，1个ShitBeast+1个ShitPlunger→1个ShitMan。这样持有人将自己的老NFT不断换为新NFT，完成价值转移，而老NFT则会通过销毁变得稀缺。\n\n![Shit→ShitBeast→ShitMan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sAbEL58pP48NdFtxZiI4d.png?height=448&width=1456)\n\n除此之外，项目方在不停和其他NFT进行联动，比如在Murakami.Flowers将要空投时发布推文，暗示持有ill poop it nft和Murakami.Flowers将会有$SHIT空投，基本上延续了ill poop it nft的“碰瓷”文化，推特的运营则把一些知名的NFT都当做自己的引流对象，不停地进行引用和讽刺，在文案和图画制作上也比较有针对性，来引起人们的情绪共鸣。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BTeXTeb5Fn2QCIVEqQojh.png?height=1072&width=1174)\n\n![一些推文（来源：Twitter）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C41DeGDLIdVWxkJwXCvVu.png?height=855&width=956)\n\n除了风格，我们看到项目方的行动非常专业且迅速，短短七天发布3个系列的NFT，并熟练应用ERC20、ERC721、ERC1155来配合不同的运营路径，不仅通过激励留住了早期持有者，也不断地开放入口让新人可以找到自己的参与的方式。\n\n# NFT的后现代主义\n\n在某种程度上，艺术，文学，音乐是互通的，而处于一个新兴赛道的 NFT 的，其发展无形中走过了“现实主义”，“现代主义”，再到如今的“后现代主义”阶段。\n\n在 NFT 早期阶段，NFT 的发展依旧依托于艺术和艺术家本身，着眼于艺术所塑造和刻画的本质，比如Beeple。慢慢地，随着 BAYC，Doodles等项目的诞生，NFT成为创作，身份和社区的多种代表，而部分人在交易的同时依旧关注其实用性，路线图，社区价值和美学精神。但同时，NFT PFP的热潮不乏代表了一种属于21世纪的反叛精神和运动。\n\n而如今，随着ill poop it nft和Goblin.wtf等项目的出现，NFT 本身更有一种自我否定，讽刺和质疑的精神。加之当前的市场行情，审美的维度得到了重述，人们用奇怪符号和简单的形式进行自我表达。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hao-EKMSuIkmJOWRH1Ogm.png?height=506&width=1201)\n\n“Your NFT is just a piece of shit.”这背后或许说明了，NFT其实没有任何使命和实用，只是大家的集体消遣。所有一切都是转瞬即逝的，虚无的，就像是你手中的 NFT。\n\n# 结语\n\n熊市到了现在，市场突然涌现出一批以“丑、恶、怪”为特点的NFT，这样一股“泥石流”的冲击，不禁让人们怀疑NFT的价值到底与何种共识对应，也许是因为人们对于目前市场的不满，大部分NFT都处于亏损的状态，这时poop NFT对一些NFT的讽刺正好引起了人们共鸣，存在着一部分情绪上的共识。随着ShitDeployer不停地升级玩法，屠龙少年是否也会成为恶龙呢？让我们持续观察。\n\n*Note：本文仅供研究使用，观点和意见仅代表作者个人，并不一定反映或代表NFTGo.io的观点和意见。投资数字资产（如NFT和数字资产）会有风险，在做出任何投资决定前，请务必咨询财务顾问。NFTGo不提供投资建议，不对任何因投资数字资产造成的损失负责。*\n\n

{"id": "-8Or5cnpgI1ah2druIrfaQ0KuTCCysGrh6U_euffC4U", "title": "In Process with Strange Cintia", "body": "[edition://0xd6F704EDB5B41109A66a04D5E8306FF6Ec5F1127?editionId=0](edition://0xd6F704EDB5B41109A66a04D5E8306FF6Ec5F1127?editionId=0)\n\nI, JL Maxcy, am the type of person to leave early for every appointment. I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below.

The content of this article is not investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product. Always DYOR.*\n\n## Introduction\n\nBTCDayu and Lanxing, the moderators of X2Y2, raised 14 serious questions about X2Y2. An investor in the crypto market is not strange to DYOR. The meaning behind that is to be rational and responsible for every investment decision you made, and minimize the negative impact of emotion as much as possible. Lanxing answered the questions frankly with true data support will be a great example of DYOR. Let’s dive deep into the questions: \n\n## 1. What is the profit model of X2Y2? What is the daily trading fee income? How much ETH can I share daily with 100k X2Y2 tokens staking? How much is for the team?\n\nLanxing:\n\nX2Y2, an NFT exchange platform similar to Opensea, profits from charging trading fees to NFT traders. The fee rate in June 2022 is 0.5%, meaning a seller pays 0.5e if his NFT worth of 100e is sold on X2Y2.\n\nWe can check the daily trading fee data directly from [Dune](https://dune.com/votan/X2Y2-NFT-Marketplace) or [NFTscan](https://www.nftscan.com/analytics/marketplace), collecting trading volume data and multiplying it by 0.5%. We can see a range between 60e to 90e as the average daily trading fee X2Y2 is calming, and the 7-day average is 72e, equal to 130k USD per day.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OyH9kyYqXkZ_0BpRQmfki.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe fee is 100% distributed to X2Y2 token holders (who are staking), including the ILO (Initial Liquidity Offer) participants. Therefore, how much you can share depends on the percentage of how many tokens you are staking verse the total staking amount and then multiplies by daily fees. According to the data from Dune, the total number of staking tokens is around 232M and 70e daily fee income now, and thus **you can share around 0.03e daily for every 100k tokens staked**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uty7kraNg_o8lvms4umjT.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nTake the no. 1 holder as an example. The address is staking more than 30M X2Y2 tokens and earns 5e - 9e daily.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FOigZAU2UD2knr6UV60wl.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAccording to the official document of [tokenomics](https://docs.x2y2.io/tokens/tokenomics), the total supply is 1B. 90M tokens, initially for the airdrop purpose, were burned, and thus the current supply is around 910M. The team and treasury are allocated 100M tokens (10%), respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3vZ__YwuaFuKwTIU1K3QM.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe team’s portion is locked, and the token will linearly unlock 1/4 (2.5% of total supply) in another 180 days after 180 days. It also shares a cut from the market fee from day one but does not share the staking rewards.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z0lKFjZPBRGcK6isip7Lw.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe graph below shows how the fees are distributed (You can monitor them [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2?a=0xf704353b5c98577d3b4274614e62fc79676d33bd)). The total fee was 87e yesterday. The team, the treasury, ILO participants, and the staking holders were allocated 17e, 14.73e, 3.3e, and 51.55e, respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pxOChJhJSjIikq0c6qruU.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 2. X2Y2’s tokenomics is similar to LOOKS’s. Why is Dayu more optimistic about the one weaker in performance? Is that true that 10% tokens allocation is on the team? (Important: This is the crucial question to differentiate Value investing from the Ponzi scheme)\n\nLanxing:\n\nX2Y2 genuinely distributes the trading fees to token holders, with no pre-staking, market making, or competing with stakeholders. The team reacts quickly to the market and has published bulk purchases, bulk listing, and community-driven marketing. The founder (TP) keeps collecting advice from the community in the DC group and replies in person.\n\nAs for LOOKS, you can refer to [this article](https://bitcoinist.com/looksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens/). LOOKS’s team transacted 50% of its staking reward to cryptocurrency tumblers by controlling the market; this is an act of sacrificing LOOKS’s retail investors and destroying community trust, not to mention there was a pre-staking mechanism for private offers (a big halve of benefit to latecomers!).\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1490747114204368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1490747114204368898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flooksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens%2F](https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1490747114204368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1490747114204368898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flooksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens%2F)\n\nThe 30-day price chart of X2Y2 and LOOKS are shown below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQUpAgGnFmEaB82VXCfMA.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gesNw0SCw75ARNET3bw8.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nBAYC community is active in LOOKS’s private offers, and among them, many are KOLs which puts LOOKS in an advantageous position. **But it is worth noticing that the Otherdeed collection is traded in volumes of 34k e and 44k e in LOOKS and X2Y2, respectively.**\n\nThe trading volume of new projects on X2Y2 has already surpassed that of LOOKS’s, while the active daily user on X2Y2 is three times of LOOKS’s.\n\nThe performance of X2Y2 on price also outperforms in a downtrend bear market. The two competitors will collide in price within two months to think optimistically.\n\n## 3. What is X2Y2’s emission schedule? How about the selling pressure in the future? What is the MC now? How its data look like compared with other projects?\n\nLanxing:\n\nWe can see the emission schedule below or have more details [here](https://mirror.xyz/x2y2.eth).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BZ6s6U2WNbUNUL72jR10-.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAs mentioned above, the total supply now is less than 910M X2Y2. Tokens owned by the team and treasury (200M) are not in the circulating supply but are collecting the fees. The unlocking schedule of the team and treasury’s token is shown below. X2Y2 was launched on 2 Feb, the 1st treasury unlocked was in May, and the 1st unlock of the team’s token will be in August.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wb8osp7QQOwtvWHgWcOFG.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWe then talk about [X2Y2 Tokenomics 2.0](https://mirror.xyz/x2y2.eth/k2Bv3UMpNFJTJiYdf5m48sANHn-Ei3m6ohmkO29qeoU).\n\n624,902 X2Y2 tokens are distributed to both seller and buyer daily. 604,902 tokens are for selling incentive, while 20,000 is for purchase incentive.\n\nThere was a mistake in setting the initial parameters of the staking rewards contract. The error resulted in per stage having, instead of the intended per block halving, ended up distributing 56% of the total 200M rewards in the first 30 days instead of the 18% initially intended.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Y6Q1YfX6lZaJlIAqeaa7.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n4500M X2Y2 tokens are allocated for trading rewards, releasing 624,902 tokens every day from 15 Feb.\n\n15M ILO tokens are linearly unlocked and can be neglected.\n\n597,790.8 tokens are allocated for the staking pool. 91.7% of tokens now (\\~2327M tokens) are in the pool.\n\nCurrently, the selling pressure is mainly from the trading rewards. Despite 70% of the trading volume being from wash trading (for the token rebate), the actual volume is still more than 10% of Opensea’s.\n\n**Therefore, the foreseeable future selling pressure shall be due to the deductions of trading rewards and staking rewards. The staking holders are more likely to observe the growth rate of users and daily trading fees income to decide what is next.**\n\nSee below for X2Y2’s circulating supply:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NNRepp6FSd3gpji-OtPax.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 4. Are the late comers of X2Y2 the money-printer of the early birds? If not, how much emission is from staking? Is the trading volume high enough to support the profit model? What will the emission schedule look like in the future?\n\nLanxing：\n\nX2Y2 is not a Ponzi scheme since there are actual trading fees as profit to support. Token holders who are staking are rewarded X2Y2 and share WETH from trading fees. The business model is akin to a royalty business but shares dividends every day instead of quarterly.\n\n**The current staking APY is 93.1%, trading fee APY is 61.2%.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jp2pySGwn16L90acx7l8N.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nFor inquiry on trading volume, please refer to question 1.\n\nFor the token emission schedule, please refer to question 3.\n\n## 5. How about the team and dev? Do they have a broad vision? Do they have executive power? Have the product developed on schedule? How is the user experience?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. TP, the founder, has a background in IT with sincere characteristics and listens to the community. You are free to come to our DC and will see TP actively responds here and is highly open-minded to constructive suggestions.\n2. The slogan of X2Y2 is “By the people, for the people.” Although the team made a mistake in setting the initial parameters of the staking rewards contract, the team found no excuse for the problem nor escaped from the questioning but organized AMA to answer the community’s worry instead. The team members slept for only 3 hours per day in the first month X2Y2 was born. We can see now that X2Y2 has formed partnerships with multiple NFT tools, including GEM, GENIE, TRAIT SNIPER, RARITY SNIPER, etc., Not to mention BENDDAO in the coming future. Besides, there are connections with other NFT communities. For instance, a strategic partnership was made with the NFT Alpha community, and Trait Sniper's CEO came to our AMA in person.\n3. The energy of the team is also high. X2Y2 is the first in the DAO NFT sector developing functions of bulk purchase, collection offers, and bulk listing. You can check the status of X2Y2’s development by clicking the link below.\n\n[https://www.notion.so/e503954ad1c44e018f956a04a0770713](https://www.notion.so/e503954ad1c44e018f956a04a0770713)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zn-XMrgaQlmjCa75laGmh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nMany users appreciate X2Y2 for its extra-low fee on trading and smooth user experience.\n\n@0x0nassis, who has more than 105k followers on Twitter, publicly admires X2Y2.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e4R5bzksXFPKpjJP_l70o.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nRecently free mint is the trend, and people can save a ton of trading fees simply by using the user-friendly X2Y2 exchange, as said in the real user experience below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Bj8ix0kWPFwtbvk0y2Xs.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nResearch institutions, including Delphi, have already mentioned X2Y2 twice.\n\n[https://twitter.com/x2y2cn/status/1532225099901767680/photo/1](https://twitter.com/x2y2cn/status/1532225099901767680/photo/1)\n\n**Active daily user pumping from 100 in Feb to a stable number of over 6000 now** is the best evidence showing how user-friendly X2Y2 is from the users’ perspective. At least, we can be so proud of saying our server does not go down often like Opensea.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TAHYwcTjEZRGngxurJFqM.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 6. Will exchange be a vital part of the NFT market?\n\nOf course. The need for exchanging is one kind of inelastic demand.\n\n## 7.  Where is the fund supporting the team’s development without being able to use the allocated tokens? Is there any plan for partnerships with VCs? Wen BN?\n\nLanxing：\n\nInitially, the development fund came from the team’s pocket, and part of it now comes from the share of the trading fee. It is worth mentioning that X2Y2 spends almost nothing on marketing since the community takes the initiative to handle this part.\n\nPartnership with VCs is on our list, and we will announce details at the right moment. **We think the resources a VC could bring are more critical to the financial support.**\n\nX2Y2 is already listed on MEXC, and **some big exchanges are also approaching us.**\n\n## 8. What is the technical background of the team? Is there any product made before as a track record? Are the media supporting us?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. Most of them are from the IT industry and haven’t disclosed any product developed before yet. I can tell that they are all experts on blockchain tech with successful experience in exchanges.\n2. Foresight News (founded by a former ChainNews member), Wincrypto, and ChainCatcher are all publishing news about X2Y2.\n\n## 9. How comes the price drop from 4.5U to 0.2U?\n\nLanxing：\n\nPrice follows the supply-and-demand theory.\n\nThe initial price was 0.5U and pumped to 4.5U for only two days. The team did not manipulate the market. The market was so hype because, on the one hand, investors were affected by emotion (since many Chinese KOL twitted about it), and some were trying to make a profit by using this hype (by pushing the price to a great altitude and dumping it at a high price). Also, the extra-high staking APY attracted people to be part of us.\n\nHowever, that is not the whole story.\n\nFirst, the result of changing people’s behavior with tokenomics 1.0 did not meet our original expectations. Still, it attracted those who wanted to make profits with the mechanism instead (I am totally fine with this behavior since this is part of the market). 200M tokens were prepared for listing rewards and were proportional related to the listing period; thus, most of the listings were low liquidity/ hard to sell, so they could generate more listing rewards. This was not what we wanted! No trading, no profit. The team then modified the listing reward mechanism several times during that period and kept developing new functions.\n\nThe mistake of the emission schedule also contributes to the drop. Initially, there should be 1.23M tokens released daily, but they ended up being 3.7M tokens instead (Question 2). The APY was super high in the first month (10,000%) and became colossal selling pressure later.\n\nThirdly, newbies, who did not understand Defi but were optimistic about the NFT market, might buy the tokens in FOMO and be scared off by the drop.\n\nThe trading volume of the X2Y2 token was more than 10M daily during that period. Most of the selling was from staking and listing rewards, and the buying force was insufficient. More importantly, our NFT trading volume did not benefit from the incentives, and thus investors were reluctant to get into X2Y2 anymore.\n\n**However, it is worth mentioning that if someone buys 100k tokens at 1U and stakes, the number of tokens now becomes around 350k. Plus the share of trading fees, the investment is already in profit in ETH-standard and can exchange for more ETH than he paid.**\n\nDuring the sudden drop, the community was overwhelmed with pessimistic emotion, especially ILO participants. There were also complaints from KOL. The team was lacking sleep too. After that, TP initiated several AMA and promised to change the situation with execution. The team believed that the only way out was to attract the actual NFT traders, so the platform can start making profits to stabilize the price. Therefore, we waved the trading fee (0%) in April, compensated the gas fee with daily 620k X2Y2 tokens, canceled the listing rewards, burned the 92M unclaimed tokens, and publicized the status of development (question 5). We found this was working and continued promotion in May, charging only a 0.5% fee on trading. The Otherdeed was hot in the month, and its trading volume on X2Y2 excesses more than 10k e. This is how X2Y2 has become the second biggest NFT exchange.\n\nWe organized an X2Y2 volunteering group in early March starting with only several people. And now, we can see from the Twitter, Wechat group, DC, etc., are promoting X2Y2. X2Y2 now has over 6k daily active users and 72e average daily trading fee income. The income is based on a 0.5% trading fee rate still, which will be 360e daily if the rate is the same as Opensea (2.5%).\n\n## 10. A token’s value capture is essential. Is there any benefit to holding X2Y2 tokens? What is the forecast in optimistic and pessimistic cases?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. Holding X2Y2 tokens means you have the right to share trading fees and staking rewards.\n2. To evaluate X2Y2 needs to take many aspects into account. The fact now is that there are only 2M ERC addresses that are active NFT traders, and 1,500 among them are whales. The market capitalization of NFT is just 26B. Compared to the total 54.38M ETH holders, the room for growth in the NFT market is enormous.\n3. If we want to know if the growth rate of trading volume and the daily active user is fast enough and if X2Y2 has moats and effective promotion strategies, we need to count on competitors.\n\nThe valuation of Opensea now is $13B. Since X2Y2’s daily user and net trading volume has already exceeded 10% of Opensea, giving X2Y2 a valuation of $1.3B seems fair.\n\nPessimistically or in the short term, I may start to buy and stake the tokens when it drops to $0.15U.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kF4WegCb5YKHfIevbZ94x.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 11. If the profit model of LOOKS trying to reward wash trading is a kind of Ponzi scheme, why are X2Y2’s staking and trading rewards different from that? How is the model different from projects like FCOIN? Will the latecomers be the money printer for the early birds?\n\nLanxing：\n\nThis question is answered in Question 2. To understand the differences, you also need to clarify what a Ponzi scheme is. Having income from outer layer sources like X2Y2’s profit model is not a Ponzi scheme.\n\n**Questions raised by Lanxing：**\n\n## 12.

The content of this article is not investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product. Always DYOR.*\n\n## Introduction\n\nBTCDayu and Lanxing, the moderators of X2Y2, raised 14 serious questions about X2Y2. An investor in the crypto market is not strange to DYOR. The meaning behind that is to be rational and responsible for every investment decision you made, and minimize the negative impact of emotion as much as possible. Lanxing answered the questions frankly with true data support will be a great example of DYOR. Let’s dive deep into the questions: \n\n## 1. What is the profit model of X2Y2? What is the daily trading fee income? How much ETH can I share daily with 100k X2Y2 tokens staking? How much is for the team?\n\nLanxing:\n\nX2Y2, an NFT exchange platform similar to Opensea, profits from charging trading fees to NFT traders. The fee rate in June 2022 is 0.5%, meaning a seller pays 0.5e if his NFT worth of 100e is sold on X2Y2.\n\nWe can check the daily trading fee data directly from [Dune](https://dune.com/votan/X2Y2-NFT-Marketplace) or [NFTscan](https://www.nftscan.com/analytics/marketplace), collecting trading volume data and multiplying it by 0.5%. We can see a range between 60e to 90e as the average daily trading fee X2Y2 is calming, and the 7-day average is 72e, equal to 130k USD per day.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OyH9kyYqXkZ_0BpRQmfki.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe fee is 100% distributed to X2Y2 token holders (who are staking), including the ILO (Initial Liquidity Offer) participants. Therefore, how much you can share depends on the percentage of how many tokens you are staking verse the total staking amount and then multiplies by daily fees. According to the data from Dune, the total number of staking tokens is around 232M and 70e daily fee income now, and thus **you can share around 0.03e daily for every 100k tokens staked**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uty7kraNg_o8lvms4umjT.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nTake the no. 1 holder as an example. The address is staking more than 30M X2Y2 tokens and earns 5e - 9e daily.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FOigZAU2UD2knr6UV60wl.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAccording to the official document of [tokenomics](https://docs.x2y2.io/tokens/tokenomics), the total supply is 1B. 90M tokens, initially for the airdrop purpose, were burned, and thus the current supply is around 910M. The team and treasury are allocated 100M tokens (10%), respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3vZ__YwuaFuKwTIU1K3QM.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe team’s portion is locked, and the token will linearly unlock 1/4 (2.5% of total supply) in another 180 days after 180 days. It also shares a cut from the market fee from day one but does not share the staking rewards.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z0lKFjZPBRGcK6isip7Lw.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe graph below shows how the fees are distributed (You can monitor them [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2?a=0xf704353b5c98577d3b4274614e62fc79676d33bd)). The total fee was 87e yesterday. The team, the treasury, ILO participants, and the staking holders were allocated 17e, 14.73e, 3.3e, and 51.55e, respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pxOChJhJSjIikq0c6qruU.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 2. X2Y2’s tokenomics is similar to LOOKS’s. Why is Dayu more optimistic about the one weaker in performance? Is that true that 10% tokens allocation is on the team? (Important: This is the crucial question to differentiate Value investing from the Ponzi scheme)\n\nLanxing:\n\nX2Y2 genuinely distributes the trading fees to token holders, with no pre-staking, market making, or competing with stakeholders. The team reacts quickly to the market and has published bulk purchases, bulk listing, and community-driven marketing. The founder (TP) keeps collecting advice from the community in the DC group and replies in person.\n\nAs for LOOKS, you can refer to [this article](https://bitcoinist.com/looksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens/). LOOKS’s team transacted 50% of its staking reward to cryptocurrency tumblers by controlling the market; this is an act of sacrificing LOOKS’s retail investors and destroying community trust, not to mention there was a pre-staking mechanism for private offers (a big halve of benefit to latecomers!).\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1490747114204368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1490747114204368898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flooksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens%2F](https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1490747114204368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1490747114204368898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flooksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens%2F)\n\nThe 30-day price chart of X2Y2 and LOOKS are shown below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQUpAgGnFmEaB82VXCfMA.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gesNw0SCw75ARNET3bw8.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nBAYC community is active in LOOKS’s private offers, and among them, many are KOLs which puts LOOKS in an advantageous position. **But it is worth noticing that the Otherdeed collection is traded in volumes of 34k e and 44k e in LOOKS and X2Y2, respectively.**\n\nThe trading volume of new projects on X2Y2 has already surpassed that of LOOKS’s, while the active daily user on X2Y2 is three times of LOOKS’s.\n\nThe performance of X2Y2 on price also outperforms in a downtrend bear market. The two competitors will collide in price within two months to think optimistically.\n\n## 3. What is X2Y2’s emission schedule? How about the selling pressure in the future? What is the MC now? How its data look like compared with other projects?\n\nLanxing:\n\nWe can see the emission schedule below or have more details [here](https://mirror.xyz/x2y2.eth).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BZ6s6U2WNbUNUL72jR10-.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAs mentioned above, the total supply now is less than 910M X2Y2. Tokens owned by the team and treasury (200M) are not in the circulating supply but are collecting the fees. The unlocking schedule of the team and treasury’s token is shown below. X2Y2 was launched on 2 Feb, the 1st treasury unlocked was in May, and the 1st unlock of the team’s token will be in August.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wb8osp7QQOwtvWHgWcOFG.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWe then talk about [X2Y2 Tokenomics 2.0](https://mirror.xyz/x2y2.eth/k2Bv3UMpNFJTJiYdf5m48sANHn-Ei3m6ohmkO29qeoU).\n\n624,902 X2Y2 tokens are distributed to both seller and buyer daily. 604,902 tokens are for selling incentive, while 20,000 is for purchase incentive.\n\nThere was a mistake in setting the initial parameters of the staking rewards contract. The error resulted in per stage having, instead of the intended per block halving, ended up distributing 56% of the total 200M rewards in the first 30 days instead of the 18% initially intended.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Y6Q1YfX6lZaJlIAqeaa7.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n4500M X2Y2 tokens are allocated for trading rewards, releasing 624,902 tokens every day from 15 Feb.\n\n15M ILO tokens are linearly unlocked and can be neglected.\n\n597,790.8 tokens are allocated for the staking pool. 91.7% of tokens now (\\~2327M tokens) are in the pool.\n\nCurrently, the selling pressure is mainly from the trading rewards. Despite 70% of the trading volume being from wash trading (for the token rebate), the actual volume is still more than 10% of Opensea’s.\n\n**Therefore, the foreseeable future selling pressure shall be due to the deductions of trading rewards and staking rewards. The staking holders are more likely to observe the growth rate of users and daily trading fees income to decide what is next.**\n\nSee below for X2Y2’s circulating supply:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NNRepp6FSd3gpji-OtPax.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 4. Are the late comers of X2Y2 the money-printer of the early birds? If not, how much emission is from staking? Is the trading volume high enough to support the profit model? What will the emission schedule look like in the future?\n\nLanxing：\n\nX2Y2 is not a Ponzi scheme since there are actual trading fees as profit to support. Token holders who are staking are rewarded X2Y2 and share WETH from trading fees. The business model is akin to a royalty business but shares dividends every day instead of quarterly.\n\n**The current staking APY is 93.1%, trading fee APY is 61.2%.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jp2pySGwn16L90acx7l8N.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nFor inquiry on trading volume, please refer to question 1.\n\nFor the token emission schedule, please refer to question 3.\n\n## 5. How about the team and dev? Do they have a broad vision? Do they have executive power? Have the product developed on schedule? How is the user experience?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. TP, the founder, has a background in IT with sincere characteristics and listens to the community. You are free to come to our DC and will see TP actively responds here and is highly open-minded to constructive suggestions.\n2. The slogan of X2Y2 is “By the people, for the people.” Although the team made a mistake in setting the initial parameters of the staking rewards contract, the team found no excuse for the problem nor escaped from the questioning but organized AMA to answer the community’s worry instead. The team members slept for only 3 hours per day in the first month X2Y2 was born. We can see now that X2Y2 has formed partnerships with multiple NFT tools, including GEM, GENIE, TRAIT SNIPER, RARITY SNIPER, etc., Not to mention BENDDAO in the coming future. Besides, there are connections with other NFT communities. For instance, a strategic partnership was made with the NFT Alpha community, and Trait Sniper's CEO came to our AMA in person.\n3. The energy of the team is also high. X2Y2 is the first in the DAO NFT sector developing functions of bulk purchase, collection offers, and bulk listing. You can check the status of X2Y2’s development by clicking the link below.\n\n[https://www.notion.so/e503954ad1c44e018f956a04a0770713](https://www.notion.so/e503954ad1c44e018f956a04a0770713)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zn-XMrgaQlmjCa75laGmh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nMany users appreciate X2Y2 for its extra-low fee on trading and smooth user experience.\n\n@0x0nassis, who has more than 105k followers on Twitter, publicly admires X2Y2.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e4R5bzksXFPKpjJP_l70o.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nRecently free mint is the trend, and people can save a ton of trading fees simply by using the user-friendly X2Y2 exchange, as said in the real user experience below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Bj8ix0kWPFwtbvk0y2Xs.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nResearch institutions, including Delphi, have already mentioned X2Y2 twice.\n\n[https://twitter.com/x2y2cn/status/1532225099901767680/photo/1](https://twitter.com/x2y2cn/status/1532225099901767680/photo/1)\n\n**Active daily user pumping from 100 in Feb to a stable number of over 6000 now** is the best evidence showing how user-friendly X2Y2 is from the users’ perspective. At least, we can be so proud of saying our server does not go down often like Opensea.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TAHYwcTjEZRGngxurJFqM.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 6. Will exchange be a vital part of the NFT market?\n\nOf course. The need for exchanging is one kind of inelastic demand.\n\n## 7.  Where is the fund supporting the team’s development without being able to use the allocated tokens? Is there any plan for partnerships with VCs? Wen BN?\n\nLanxing：\n\nInitially, the development fund came from the team’s pocket, and part of it now comes from the share of the trading fee. It is worth mentioning that X2Y2 spends almost nothing on marketing since the community takes the initiative to handle this part.\n\nPartnership with VCs is on our list, and we will announce details at the right moment. **We think the resources a VC could bring are more critical to the financial support.**\n\nX2Y2 is already listed on MEXC, and **some big exchanges are also approaching us.**\n\n## 8. What is the technical background of the team? Is there any product made before as a track record? Are the media supporting us?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. Most of them are from the IT industry and haven’t disclosed any product developed before yet. I can tell that they are all experts on blockchain tech with successful experience in exchanges.\n2. Foresight News (founded by a former ChainNews member), Wincrypto, and ChainCatcher are all publishing news about X2Y2.\n\n## 9. How comes the price drop from 4.5U to 0.2U?\n\nLanxing：\n\nPrice follows the supply-and-demand theory.\n\nThe initial price was 0.5U and pumped to 4.5U for only two days. The team did not manipulate the market. The market was so hype because, on the one hand, investors were affected by emotion (since many Chinese KOL twitted about it), and some were trying to make a profit by using this hype (by pushing the price to a great altitude and dumping it at a high price). Also, the extra-high staking APY attracted people to be part of us.\n\nHowever, that is not the whole story.\n\nFirst, the result of changing people’s behavior with tokenomics 1.0 did not meet our original expectations. Still, it attracted those who wanted to make profits with the mechanism instead (I am totally fine with this behavior since this is part of the market). 200M tokens were prepared for listing rewards and were proportional related to the listing period; thus, most of the listings were low liquidity/ hard to sell, so they could generate more listing rewards. This was not what we wanted! No trading, no profit. The team then modified the listing reward mechanism several times during that period and kept developing new functions.\n\nThe mistake of the emission schedule also contributes to the drop. Initially, there should be 1.23M tokens released daily, but they ended up being 3.7M tokens instead (Question 2). The APY was super high in the first month (10,000%) and became colossal selling pressure later.\n\nThirdly, newbies, who did not understand Defi but were optimistic about the NFT market, might buy the tokens in FOMO and be scared off by the drop.\n\nThe trading volume of the X2Y2 token was more than 10M daily during that period. Most of the selling was from staking and listing rewards, and the buying force was insufficient. More importantly, our NFT trading volume did not benefit from the incentives, and thus investors were reluctant to get into X2Y2 anymore.\n\n**However, it is worth mentioning that if someone buys 100k tokens at 1U and stakes, the number of tokens now becomes around 350k. Plus the share of trading fees, the investment is already in profit in ETH-standard and can exchange for more ETH than he paid.**\n\nDuring the sudden drop, the community was overwhelmed with pessimistic emotion, especially ILO participants. There were also complaints from KOL. The team was lacking sleep too. After that, TP initiated several AMA and promised to change the situation with execution. The team believed that the only way out was to attract the actual NFT traders, so the platform can start making profits to stabilize the price. Therefore, we waved the trading fee (0%) in April, compensated the gas fee with daily 620k X2Y2 tokens, canceled the listing rewards, burned the 92M unclaimed tokens, and publicized the status of development (question 5). We found this was working and continued promotion in May, charging only a 0.5% fee on trading. The Otherdeed was hot in the month, and its trading volume on X2Y2 excesses more than 10k e. This is how X2Y2 has become the second biggest NFT exchange.\n\nWe organized an X2Y2 volunteering group in early March starting with only several people. And now, we can see from the Twitter, Wechat group, DC, etc., are promoting X2Y2. X2Y2 now has over 6k daily active users and 72e average daily trading fee income. The income is based on a 0.5% trading fee rate still, which will be 360e daily if the rate is the same as Opensea (2.5%).\n\n## 10. A token’s value capture is essential. Is there any benefit to holding X2Y2 tokens? What is the forecast in optimistic and pessimistic cases?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. Holding X2Y2 tokens means you have the right to share trading fees and staking rewards.\n2. To evaluate X2Y2 needs to take many aspects into account. The fact now is that there are only 2M ERC addresses that are active NFT traders, and 1,500 among them are whales. The market capitalization of NFT is just 26B. Compared to the total 54.38M ETH holders, the room for growth in the NFT market is enormous.\n3. If we want to know if the growth rate of trading volume and the daily active user is fast enough and if X2Y2 has moats and effective promotion strategies, we need to count on competitors.\n\nThe valuation of Opensea now is $13B. Since X2Y2’s daily user and net trading volume has already exceeded 10% of Opensea, giving X2Y2 a valuation of $1.3B seems fair.\n\nPessimistically or in the short term, I may start to buy and stake the tokens when it drops to $0.15U.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kF4WegCb5YKHfIevbZ94x.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 11. If the profit model of LOOKS trying to reward wash trading is a kind of Ponzi scheme, why are X2Y2’s staking and trading rewards different from that? How is the model different from projects like FCOIN? Will the latecomers be the money printer for the early birds?\n\nLanxing：\n\nThis question is answered in Question 2. To understand the differences, you also need to clarify what a Ponzi scheme is. Having income from outer layer sources like X2Y2’s profit model is not a Ponzi scheme.\n\n**Questions raised by Lanxing：**\n\n## 12. Why is the community willing to promote X2Y2 volunteering?\n\nPlease check the article below (Only the Chinese version is available now):\n<https://mirror.xyz/0x4631e0eCda7a39ba951f297c65C1A6E680dc94c4/k_avW8kYhE4QklvDvuAs8becTFbCHzTR274e7bmLX0A>\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-GPIq6KjBJaENl1HHI3mU.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 13.

You can open a long position if you believe one asset’s price will go up or open short positions if you expect it will go down. At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17around 20 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J8zu2hqPwpMn4gBJxvyZO.png?height=790&width=1370)\n\nYou can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-curie-arbitrageur\n\nThe way **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)** works is that, whenever there is a price difference between [Perp v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) (a derivative DEX) and [FTX](https://ftx.com/) (a CEX), the bot will buy on the cheaper side and sell on the more expensive side. Out of the box, this template allows you to set the desired price difference for the bot to take action. Additionally, you can specify the markets for the bot to run the arbitrage strategy.\n\nOf course, we can’t just look at the rewards. How about the risks associated with running this bot?\n\nThe main risk is liquidation, which can happen when you use too much leverage to trade on either Perp v2 or FTX. Luckily, the bot lets you set the margin ratio you’re comfortable with, which is the reciprocal of leverage, and it will start to reduce the position sizes whenever the margin ratio is reached.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n***If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot by the readme in the [perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.***\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned what Perp v2 is and the risks and rewards of running an arbitraging bot on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a bot on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35K8a0HNOpAgrqyZe8-9u.png?height=1056&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer.\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmWcwfTH5meqjcgJXX42B.png?height=772&width=1368)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FG5l25__gsXRy2WqTwan9.png?height=976&width=1026)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-curie-arbitrageur repo and build it locally. You can do so with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur.git`\n\n`cd perp-curie-arbitrageur`\n\n`npm install`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything goes well, you should be able to see responses like the ones below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oHajKZfB6oCOvhrfk_ln.png?height=420&width=1366)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances, especially those who claim to be part of a customer service team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AZkHnVO2PIpDf7g12I2Ix.png?height=808&width=1366)\n\n## Get the Tokens you Need\n\nThere are two tokens we need in order to run perp-curie-arbitrageur. They are ETH and USDC. **Please be aware that, since there is no test account on FTX, we’ll be using real ETH and USDC in the following**. It’s better to start with a small amount to get comfortable with it and then increase from there.\n\n* **For ETH**:\n\n  If you only use CEX like Binance or FTX, you can use [LayerSwap](https://www.layerswap.io/) to transfer some of your ETH to Optimism. If you have ETH on chains like Ethereum or BNB Chain, you can use [TransferTo.xyz](https://transferto.xyz/swap) to bridge your ETH to Optimism. **ETH is used to pay the gas fees for your transactions** and each transaction on Perp v2 costs around 0.001 ETH, so even 0.1 ETH can be used for a long time.\n* **For USDC**:\n\n  Similar to ETH, you can use either LayerSwap or TransferTo depending on how much you want to transfer and from where. And as mentioned above, **USDC is used as the collateral for your positions**.\n\nAlso, because by default, MetaMask doesn’t include Optimism in the network list, you need to go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to add Optimism to your MetaMask to see your ETH and USDC balance in your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni590TmTaReallO5-aRV6.png?height=764&width=1366)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Rename the .env.example file to .env and modify it\n\nYou need to rename the .env.example file in the root folder of perp-curie-arbitrageur to .env and add a web3 endpoint, your wallet’s private key, and everything related to FTX to it. Here is what your .env file looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TBM7eUvmNl8RN63gTvlWy.png?height=386&width=1366)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint for Optimism, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)**. If you wonder what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider, e.g. Infura, will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/74kJqYT6TE7k7ntWyKUE8.png?height=796&width=1366)\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.”  Similar to recovery phrases, you should **never** share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uI8QlZXgLQLdkFhHl6ucq.png?height=950&width=560)\n\nAs for FTX’s API key and secret, you can generate them by going to the [API page](https://ftx.com/settings/api) of your subaccount and clicking \"Create API Key”. The permission should be “Trading” only.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XQOmbcYNb_-sCsYEVNr-c.png?height=454&width=820)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* BALANCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check your balance on FTX and your address.\n* ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH:\n* BALANCE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH: The maximum amount of gas fees in ETH that you’re willing to pay to do arbitrage. One thing worth pointing out is that , Optimism uses the first-comes, first-served approach to process transactions, meaning that increasing the ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH will not confirm any faster.\n* PERP_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO: As we mentioned above, the margin ratio is the metric to show how many leverages you use. The lower this metric, the easier for your position to get liquidated.  If you set them as 0.2, then the max leverage is 5x. Recommended to start from 1 to be safe.\n* PERP_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO: The margin ratio threshold when the positions on both platforms will start to be reduced. For instance, if you set them as 0.1 here, that means your positions will begin to be closed when your leverage reaches 10x. Recommended to begin with a number that is closer to 1 to start with.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_AMOUNT: 9000,\n  The USD value of the position that the bot should start to close when the emergency margin ratio is reached.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_SLEEP_SEC: The interval between each emergency reduction should be.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency that emergency checks should be conducted.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to true to enable this market.\n* FTX_MARKET_NAME: The name of the market on FTX. Usually, if it’s a perpetual market, then it’ll follow a naming convention of ticker-perp. For instance, BTC’s perpetual market is known as BTC-PERP on FTX.\n* ORDER_AMOUNT: Order amount in USDC for each trade. Remember to top up your account before running the bot.\n* SHORT_TRIGGER_SPREAD:\n* LONG_TRIGGER_SPREAD: The price difference threshold between both platforms at which the bot should start executing your strategy.\n* IS_EMERGENCY_REDUCE_MODE_ENABLED:\n  Whether (or not) the bot should reduce positions when the leverage is too high.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. However, the bot can support up to 5 markets simultaneously. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally\n\nThere is one extra step for Windows users - you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file otherwise it can’t read the parameters in your .env file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully on your machine, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5Go3tdgnLsHOHaraBjw0.png?height=564&width=1022)\n\n## Run on AWS Lambda\n\n*If you’re not familiar with AWS Lambda, you can watch this video to [learn more about it (or serverless in general) in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_VV2Fx32_Y&ab_channel=Fireship). But in general, the main selling point of AWS’ Lambda is that, instead of renting a dedicated server on AWS to run your program 24/7. You only pay the times when your application runs on a shared server, which is more suitable for our use case as the bot only runs from time to time based on your settings.*\n\nAs a starter for this section, **you need to register an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and install AWS CLI on your machine**. Check the installation instructions for each OS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).\n\n**Once AWS CLI is installed, you need to [configure your AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) by running the following command** in your Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows):\n\n`aws configure`\n\nThen you need to type your access key and secret. You can create them from the [Identity and Access Management page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oY3trcl2-nanWI5PxCV5L.png?height=258&width=1178)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YStXJ4AHlHEkI_b9QQTuw.png?height=686&width=1218)\n\nDepending on your settings, sometimes you need to create a new user on AWS to generate a key. To do so, you need to click Users on the Identity and Access Management page and then create a new user with permission to manage Lambda.\n\n**Following this, you need to type the AWS region you use in the .env file in your perp-curie-arbitrageur folder**. For instance, add AWS_REGION=ap-southest-1 to the file if you choose a server located in Singapore.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i13sUcuIHcQhUTzwfacHo.png?height=686&width=1228)\n\nAlso, for Windows users who have run the bot locally in the previous sections, you need to remove the two lines that you added in the index.ts file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nBy now we’re all set! Enter the following commands in your terminal to deploy the bot to AWS:\n\n`npm run build`\n\n`npm run sls:deploy`\n\nYou should be able to see the following responses if everything goes well:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HgxYHicK9JFy_6nU9HplL.png?height=490&width=1228)\n\nOnce your bot is running, you can see the real-time logs by going to the *perp-arbitrageur-production-main* Lambda function on AWS and clicking the “View logs in CloudWatch” under the Monitor tab. You should be able to see similar logs when running the bot on your computer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KmdiO6etAAGga9RGrOsYr.png?height=716&width=1228)\n\nCongratulations! Your bot is now automatically arbitraging the price difference between Perp v2 and FTX!\n\n## Further Modification Suggestions\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article, this bot is just a template for arbitraging between Perp v2 and FTX. Given the nature of an open-sourced software, anyone can add functionalities to this bot. Below are some directions that you can explore:\n\n* **Support more DEXes and CEXes**\n\n  You can modify the bot to support for CEXs like Binance or Huobi to discover more arbitraging opportunities. It also applies to derivative DEXs as there are numerous of them on the market.\n* **Better position wind down process**\n\n  Currently, the bot will close positions from both exchanges when the margin ratio reaches the limit you set. A better approach to wind down positions should be closing both sides when the prices on both exchanges are the same and do it gradually to reduce price impact aka slippage per trade.\n* **Error or success report**\n\n  Right now the bot only does its job quietly and you can only check CloudWatch to know its status. One way to improve this is to add a script to send out a Telegram or Discord message when certain criteria are met. For instance, you can write a script to send out Telegram messages when a trade is successful.\n\nThat’s the end of our tutorial on how to run **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)**!\n\n**Besides this tutorial, recently we also have released tutorials on how to run [perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker)!** Feel free to check them out.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/LWB40sjbmk4R34eq2ZD88vm466wAZ7iiskalKWGVPXc](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/LWB40sjbmk4R34eq2ZD88vm466wAZ7iiskalKWGVPXc)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/Om0vxOZKa3LTp22_fVhzMxrVPZ2blticcdmPzIrjkj4](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/Om0vxOZKa3LTp22_fVhzMxrVPZ2blticcdmPzIrjkj4)\n\n**One last thing - we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) on our Discord for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.

{"id": "7IVAN1t97XIWZWRFs0bm-JMB6WzKDrc6-5lopoMAEC4", "title": "Running Perp-maker for Profits & Fun: Part 1", "body": "[Perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker) is an open-source market-making template for [Perpetual Protocol v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post), the most popular dApp on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/apps/defi) *(a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum)*. Anyone can use or modify the template to facilitate trades on the protocol and earn fees.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll go over what Perpetual Protocol is, the risks and rewards associated with running the bot, and how to run it locally. Due to the length of this article, we’ll cover how to run the bot on AWS and further modification suggestions in part 2. Stay tuned!\n\n## Perpetual Protocol 101\n\nFirst thing first, what is Perpetual Protocol?\n\nPerpetual Protocol is a decentralized derivative exchange (DEX) where traders can use USDC *(a USD-pegged stablecoin)* to speculate on cryptocurrency’s price movement with up to 10x leverage. At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more! You can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6KeGLlSsa-3SOSv_-S-k1.png?height=806&width=1370)\n\n### But What does “Market-making” Mean?\n\nWhenever a trade happens, there will always be two sides involved - a taker and a maker. The takers initiate a trade, and the makers provide the inventory to let the taker take.\n\nHere is a real-life example. When buying a fish from a vendor, you’re the taker of this trade as you’re the one that takes what the vendor supplies. As for the vendor, he is the maker of this trade as he prepares the inventory (fish in this example) that makes this trade possible.\n\nSimilarly, being a market-maker, or “maker,” on Perp v2 means you [provide the liquidity](https://blog.perp.fi/how-to-provide-liquidity-on-perp-v2-9064ed085d7f) (the assets) that traders can take, making the market viable. In return, you receive 80% of the transaction fees paid by the trader. For instance, if a trader opens a long position and this trade happens in the price range you set, you act as the other side of the trade - i.e., opening a short position as a result, and vice versa.\n\nMakers on Perp v2 can choose the price range to which they provide liquidity. For instance, in the screenshot below, this user wants to provide liquidity to the BTC market with a price range of $9,991.99 to $60,081.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb5f4JjKvWmd88x2iwT2L.png?height=806&width=1370)\n\nWhenever a trade happens in that range, this user collects 80% of the transaction fees proportionately. One thing worth pointing out is that USDC is the only asset you need to deposit to start market-making on Perp v2. Once you deposit some USDC, the system will mint the virtual tokens (0.1 vBTC and 4316.31 vUSD in the screenshot) you need to trade or market-make with.\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-maker\n\nWith perp-maker, anyone can automate their market-making strategy on Perp v2 to earn transaction fees and liquidity mining rewards *(more on this later)*.\n\n**Out of the box, perp-maker lets you choose which market you want to provide liquidity to and within what price range**. As a reminder, if the market price moves out of the price range you set, you will not collect any transaction fees until it moves back in the range. **Perp-maker can automatically adjust your liquidity and realize the [impermanent loss](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3) when the market price reaches the price level you set.**\n\n### But What is Impermanent Loss?\n\nOn Perp v2, makers act as the other side of each trade. If a trader makes a profit, a maker loses money. This loss is impermanent as it will become 0 when the market price returns to the initial price. Even if the market price moves away from the initial price, you can collect fees if the market price stays in the price range.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4T-vCemGHAoAu6SYZnmjR.png?height=1012&width=1908)\n\nAs a rule of thumb, **the wider the price range you set, the less [impermanent loss](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3) you suffer; however, the less transaction fees you can collect. And the more transaction fees generated on a market, the better for you as a maker.** You can use the [Perpetual Simulator](https://defi-lab-test-vhee9.ondigitalocean.app/perpetualsimulator) to simulate different price ranges in any given market to gauge the profitability of your strategy.\n\nAdditionally, **the developers behind the protocol provide its token, known as $PERP, as an extra reward to encourage more people to be makers**. This reward is distributed weekly proportional to the transaction fees you collect for that market. **This weekly reward is known as liquidity mining rewards.**\n\nTo recap - **if the transaction fees plus liquidity mining rewards outweigh the impermanent loss, it’s a profitable strategy**. If not, it can still be a profitable strategy over a more extended timeframe as it takes time for the combined value of the fees and liquidity mining rewards to catch up with the impermanent loss.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n*If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot using the readme in the [perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.*\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned how Perp v2 works and the risks and rewards of being a maker on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a perp-maker on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6QOtvjcuMi36QkSCyQLfm.png?height=1062&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer:\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N4a5KHu_9C987ll57Uyxt.png?height=782&width=1370)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node’ is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZqQ1j9QNzMjFhO46GrGPM.png?height=980&width=1024)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-maker repo and build it locally. You can do it with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker.git`\n\n`cd perp-maker`\n\n`npm i`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything works properly, you should see something on your terminal that’s similar to what’s displayed below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dIWmLkTfy6EDqLNK3H5On.png?height=496&width=1372)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mBbPh3b35FiRWt5KwFPlY.png?height=808&width=1370)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Modify .env file\n\nYou need to add a web3 endpoint and your wallet’s private key to the .env file in your perp-maker folder. Here is what it looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4-JyvjGUDUWHpm33uiKpm.png?height=872&width=1370)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).** For testing purposes, you should get an endpoint for “Optimism Kovan”, not “Optimism Mainnet” or “Kovan”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m4tW5ytUsE7qwyP66q3bt.png?height=802&width=1370)\n\n*If you’re wondering what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider e.g. Infura will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.*\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.” Similar to recovery phrases, you should never share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sXTYNdQbm1Irp0oiHOB7l.png?height=1032&width=608)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* ADJUST_MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI: The maximum gas fee in Gwei which the bot will adjust liquidity. If the gas price exceeds this number, the liquidity won't be adjusted. Currently, the gas price on Optimism is fixed at 0.001 Gwei.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to \\`true\\` to enable this market.\n* LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT:How much vUSD (after leverage) to provide as liquidity. Perp v2 supports up to 10x leverage, meaning that you can use up to 10x of your deposited USDC to provide liquidity.\n* LIQUIDITY_RANGE_OFFSET: The offset to upper price and lower price of the liquidity range. For example, if it’s set to 0.05, it will provide liquidity from (current price / 1.05) to (current price \\* 1.05).\n* LIQUIDITY_ADJUST_THRESHOLD: The threshold that the bot will remove your existing liquidity, realize the impermanent loss, and place a new price range. For example, if it’s set to 0.01, the bot will remove your existing liquidity when the current price goes out of the range below (initial price/ 1.01) or above (the initial price\\* 1.01), and subsequently provides liquidity with a new price range based on LIQUIDITY_RANGE_OFFSET and the current price.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally on Optimism Kovan (testnet)\n\nYou need to get some test tokens before running the bot on Optimism testnet. Head to [Optifaucet](https://kovan.optifaucet.com/), type in your wallet address *(which starts with 0x)* and send out the request.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/472eL25IaWpOqyc8sth44.png?height=718&width=1230)\n\n*If you run out of the test ETH to pay for transactions, you can go to [Paradigm’s faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to request more test ETH and then bridge them to Optimism Kovan via [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).*\n\nWe’re almost ready! The bot by default is set to run on Optimism. To run on Optimism Kovan, you need to add an endpoint for the testnet (as demonstrated above) and comment *(add two “slashes” before the codes)* the two lines below in the index.ts file which is located in the src folder.\n\n`// process.env[\"STAGE\"] = \"production\"`\n\n`// process.env[\"NETWORK\"] = \"optimism\"`\n\nFor Windows users, you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file:\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv):\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal to do it:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gcsUq-i2kMpXkbpk-f3d.png?height=372&width=1374)\n\nAnother way to validate if the template runs successfully is to check the target markets in the pool section on the UI. For testnet *(Optimism Kovan)*, please visit [testnet.perp.exchange](https://testnet.perp.exchange/); As for mainnet *(Optimism)*, visit [app.perp.com](https://app.perp.com/).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wTbtDlx5qj7XnJaxGMRs1.png?height=764&width=1374)\n\nAlright!

{"id": "C_ekRTF4b7Hm1QsdlFZLV2BPlZAQuqMm7bpOZPt1eEw", "title": "StepN随想", "body": "       2021年底的时候朋友介绍了Sweatcoin给我，那是使我重新开始看Web 3 运动类项目的契机。在此之后的两个月，一位朋友在偶然的交谈中和我说他买了StepN，说起来有趣，那时我的第一反应是这是一个新的运动品牌，后来经他提醒才知道这是一个区块链的运动项目。早期基本就是对着英文白皮书边跑步边研究，后来发了朋友圈后又被朋友拉进了StepN的社区，那一刻开始认知其初期用户画像和社区文化。\n\n       到今天，StepN已经占据讨论的话题榜许久了。无论是曾经GMT 从0.1U到4U的财富效应，还是屡禁不止的关于其庞氏倒塌的谈论和预测，这个项目都是2022年迄今为止最备受瞩目和资本青睐的项目。 那今天，我作为一个“资深”用户，来理性、客观地分析一下，StepN究竟是怎样一个项目。 （利益相关披露：持有sneakers 9双；感性披露：忠实用户）\n\n**项目背景和赛道分析：**    \n\n      首先，StepN属于Web 3 的应用类项目。在Axie带领疯狂的Gamfi season开始之后，就有无数关于Web 3 应用的讨论（在这里仅讨论针对C端用户的项目）。 这里我们先回顾一下Web3 是什么。 <https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/>\n\n**Web 3 的特征包括：**\nAnyone who is on the network has permission to use the service – or in other words, permission isn't required.\nNo one can block you or deny you access to the service.\nPayments are built in via the native token.\n\n       这是 Sam Richards 给出的关于什么是Web 3 的定义。但是发展到今天的Web 3 上的应用与Web 3的概念并非全然相同。\n\n       首先，应用是搭建在去中心化的网络之上（比如Ethereum，Solana，Avax等）。其次，所有的支付手段都有原生代币支付。最后大多数应用也有相当中心化的团队和管理方式，比如监督管理的部分、规则制定、分成方式的制定、甚至是用户数据是中心化存储还是去中心化存储。（姑且称这些应用为Web 2.5）\n\n        这里先问一个问题：**作为一个普通人，驱使你从Web 2 的app迁徙到web3 的动力是什么？再进一步，如果Web 2 的app内在革新拥抱 web 3，那还需要这些Web 3 的dapp不？** \n\n这俩问题非常开放，我主要分享我个人对第一个问题的回答：**数据隐私和奖励**，会是最大的驱使我使用web 3应用的原因。 \n\n         **数据隐私**非常好理解，比如今天我们在微信上聊天所有的记录都可以被微信监测并管理，我们在ins上浏览的数据也会被采集然后通过算法推荐最适合你的商品给你。那随着数据权的进一步发展和个人信息保护意识的崛起，会有一批人为了保护自己的数据权利，迁徙到web 3上。 \n\n        **奖励**也很直白，我们在Web 2花时间花钱但是什么也得不到的事情，如果在Web3可以获得奖励，无论是FT还是NFT，都会吸引一大批使用者到来。\n\n       就这两点而言，现在我们可以看到的大多数项目，都是做好了第二点。 StepN尤其是如此。 STEPN缘何如此成功 Web 2 运动相关的app非常多，比如Keep、FitTime等。Web 3 和Move 2 earn相关的Dapp有包括像Stepapp、Genopets、Walken、Sweatcoin、Aglet等。 <https://twitter.com/SnapFingersDAO/status/1528028764172537862?s=20&t=6TU3wodbEXw1pcmqZYSMqQ>\n\n\n那这么多的应用中，为何StepN脱颖而出？接下来我们来分析一下这个项目在设计上成功的几大原因\n“**简单好用的产品、强大真实的社群、和防作弊措施**” （我的概括，欢迎讨论）\n\n**产品**：\n\n       StepN的产品非常简单和专注。其所有的使用场景都是围绕着Sneaker来的。如果要玩这个游戏，在完成注册账户和钱包之后，首先你需要买至少一双鞋。有了这双鞋才能开始所有的游戏体验。 \n\n       游戏里有三个核心要素：鞋子、能量、宝石 鞋子是你用来赚钱的工具，不过要注意，哪怕同时拥有很多很多双鞋，你也只能使用其中一双鞋子来走路赚钱。 能量：你拥有的鞋子的数量和稀有度会决定你所拥有的能量 宝石：鞋子拥有4个不同的属性，拥有宝石可以升级\n\n**真实强大的社群**：   \n\n       首先明确，这一点更适用于Solana上的StepN。事实上，StepN在发展之初，其实几乎没有和媒体合作过。他们专注于社区运营和合作，经常开放AMA，答题送sneaker，以及和其他社区一起运营活动。\n\n       就我观察，其在韩国和日本、台北的很多社群都是粉丝用户自发发起的，包括了线上的社群和线下的运营。 这一点非常重要，因为gamfi项目事实上只有不断的新增用户，才能维持住游戏系统的稳定，才能维持住币价和鞋子的价格。 \n\n        这里说的用户是排除了工作室的。因为有工作室入场的gamfi，虽会昙花一现的暴涨，但生命周期也会迅速变短。BSC所经历的也正映射着这一切。 \n\n**防作弊措施**： \n\n        这也是游戏的基石，也是把这个StepN变成长期生活方式的前提。AI识别准确度不断提高。看项目方最近的几次更新也都非常强调他的反作弊系统。虽然也出了误被识别为Bot的“惨剧”，但是这丝毫没有影响反作弊在项目方心中的重要性。\n\n       这其实让我想起了当年高考的各种防作弊举措。这虽然不会对个体的分数产生什么影响，但是这是保证“高考是选拔人才的制度”的大前提。\n\n**STEPN下一步何去何从**    \n\n      最近我们看到StepN上出现了各种各样的问题，FUD的声音和社区的失望也是此起彼伏。那StepN接下来应该何去何从？ 首先，无论是从项目方的角度还是从投资机构的角度，StepN第一步已经取得了重大的成功。现在出现了很多问题，**恰恰是因为其发展的速度超出了最初的设想，以及愈发庞大的用户数量，不断压缩试错的空间。**\n\n       在我看来，STEPN已经做好了第一步，即吸引用户，那接下来更多要解决的就是用户留存问题。 \n\n         在这里非常赞同破音(Twitter@poyincom)的想法。（以下观点引用于破音，稍作修改）\n\n *“现在玩家分两部分：一类比较关注回本和价格，但这么高的回报率不可能一直维持下去，收益降低他们马上会离开。一类是忠实玩家，我微信上看到比较多。有人说他做梦都想要一双绿鞋，还有用户说，只要715让他走就行。他们感受到了Stepn对生活的正反馈，这才是价值所在。他们对经济模型没有投机用户这么在意。*\n\n*要做的是保住忠实用户，教化更多其他的用户。前提肯定是产品正常使用，（很多玩家是因为宕机没耐心）然后才是补经济模型。*\n\n*用户留存是重中之重，更需要多种样的消费场景：冲动消费、情感消费、炫耀消费，健康消费。比如这次更新的在鞋上刻字就很好。没消费场景，经济模型压力肯定大。提高忠实用户，降低投机用户比例，才能达到生态平衡”*\n\n我的想法类似，除了分类用户，倾听社区声音、保持App正常运行外：\n**1 短期：创造更多的消耗场景的出现**——单纯的play2earn不具有长期可持续性，可以看最长寿的Axie的今天。需要在让用户赚取GST的同时能够把钱花在这里\n\n**2 长远：应该有更巨大的可能性**，依托于fitness & health有衍生的社交、消费都可能是StepN能够覆盖的领域\n\n关于这一点我能想到的一个理想状态：     \n\n       如果Gamfi世界的玩家就好像深圳的一个打工人，收入用来消费（吃喝住行）+ 投资（买房、买股），最后都留在了深圳（游戏系统内）。同时也要考虑玩家间的博弈，不是人人都能赚到钱（就像深圳也不是人人赚到钱一样），这样才能维持长久的平衡和存续。 这要求了项目方不断考虑增加各种utility来消耗、投资，把钱留下。社交属性、个性化属性也应该在这个节点出现。\n\n**游戏内的重要机制** \n\nshoe minting：   \n\n       这类似于是游戏中的繁殖。鞋子的总基数是这么扩大的，同时Mint也可以让鞋子持有者在一些情况下赚取收益。 这里就不得不提，这次更新后（20220608）的mint的成本调整。这次BSC的鞋子暴涨事件背后也暴露了这么设定的问题。如果mint的利润过高，会引得工作室入场疯狂繁殖，而扰乱正常的生态发展周期。 \n\n       更新后规则为：当GST币价逐渐升高时，除GST和基础GMT （baseGMT）外增加额外GMT（addGMT）消耗。Mint成本公式为：A GST + B baseGMT + (A+B)\\* x% addGMT。以下是 x 随GST币价升高的变化规则：\n\n```\n2.1 当GST<4U时，x=0\n2.2 当GST在4U和8U之间时，x=50% \n2.3 当GST在8U和12U之间时，x=100% \n2.4 当GST在12U和16U之间时，x=200% \n2.5 当GST在16U和20U之间时，x=400% \n2.6 当GST在20U和30U之间时，x=800%\n2.7 当GST在30U和40U之间时，x=1600%\n2.8 当GST在40U和50U之间时，x=3200%\n2.9 当GST>50U时，x=6400%\n```\n\n       我们对比一下调整前后的公式可以看到：新的动态mint成本主要旨在打击单纯mint交易获利的行为，引导用户回到运动走路的初心。\n\n**STEPN的代币模型**\nStepN采取了双代币模型。GMT为治理代币而GST为游戏内实用代币。与 GMT 代币不同，GST 享有无限供应，可以通过基本运动在游戏中铸造。\n\n这样的代币模型里，是有一些问题需要去思考。这不仅仅是StepN，也是整个Gamfi都要去思考的问题（虽然我觉得把StepN归类为Gamfi也不完全合适）\n**1、GST/游戏内代币的通胀模型和永恒增发\n2、GST价格和MINT的回本周期问题（BSC链之所以迅速发展又迅速崩塌的原因）\n3、GMT应用场景和赋能\n4、关于庞氏批评**\n\n1、GST/游戏内代币的通胀模型和永恒增发   \n\n       Stepn 同时也是其他gamfi 最大的问题 是 如何长久的产生GST（或者游戏内无限增发）造成的抛压？ 以及鞋子不断增长，如何达到一个供需平衡。现在我们可以看到由于新增的缓慢和不断生产出来的GST对市场造成了持续的抛压。同时，GST的持续下跌造成了回本周期的不断的不断拉长。\n\n      这一点我觉得其实和所有国家货币的发行一样，**其实我们的财富一直随着国家发行货币被稀释（1990年100USD的购买力 vs 今天）但是通胀的速度和消费的速度以及收入的速度如何达到平衡，非常考验项目方的智慧和设计。**\n\n2、GST价格和MINT的回本周期问题  \n\n      这一点昨天的更新已经提供了一种解答。延长cool down时间和mint cost的动态调整。 还记得不久前的BNB realm，b-gst和s-gst的价格出现巨大的鸿沟，最多的时候b-gst达到40，同期s-gst的价格只有5u。巨大的价差、mint 的巨大收益以及当时的能量共享机制也给了投机者机会。众多的工作室和投机者涌入Stepn的BSC链，在短期内推动价格急速上涨后，也迅速地走向消亡。\n\n3、GMT应用场景和赋能\n由于在现在这个发展阶段GMT并没有什么实质性的用处，因此GST现更像是这个游戏的基石。GST的产生只有一种方式，及时走路。但是其消耗却有包括 升级、mint、开宝箱、合成宝石、转账等等构成。\n这里期待项目方的解答。\n\n4、是否是庞氏？ 庞氏的批判其实不仅是对于Stepn，更是对于整个Gamfi生态。我们可以看到大多数的Gamfi项目中的Fi，就是与金融相结合。金融其实也包括很多形式、像是借贷、存款、保险等多种形式。但是现在的Gamfi只用了很少的部分，即play to earn。玩游戏的前期所投入的资金（用于购买NFT、道具或者代币）后期会因为在游戏中赚取NFT或者游戏代币而产生收益。   \n\n       **但是凭空生产出来的代币意义为何？ 发行依据是什么？使用价值是什么？ 所谓的外部性又是什么？** \n\n     我们可以看到，比特币诞生之初，也只有很低的价值。几万个比特币买pizza的故事我们也听过。 **代币的价值在于共识。而建立共识的方式，则很多种多样。**\n\n     在Stepn这个个案中，我觉得可以把GMT（治理代笔）看作是公司的股权的token化的形式。所有的代币持有者就像股东一样，可以以特定方式参与公司治理。我们也可以一起去思考，在这样的假定下，token持有者如何更好地去共享公司的增长。同时，也可以看到Stepn在拓展可能的外部性，从branding层面出品联名鞋子，是Stepn链接外部的尝试。

DID 规范**\n\n1）DID标识符，是一个全局唯一的表示你身份的东西，就像你的身份证号码一样。其形式大致如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MYOvCtTnkpf3G0zi_T7h3.png?height=121&width=522)\n\nDID示例：did:eth:123456789abcdefg\n\nDID标识符不容易记忆。根据Zooko三角形理论，没有任何标识符能够同时实现易记忆、安全、去中心化。在这里，W3C的DID取了后两者。\n\nDID Infrastructure是一个全局键值对数据库，这个数据库要么是某个DID兼容的区块链，要么是某个DID兼容的分布式账本，或者是某个DID兼容的去中心化网络（其实这个数据库的位置就是DID标识符中的example字段，目前已经有非常多的合法地址）。在这个数据库中，DID标识符是键，而DID文档是值。\n\n2）DID文档是一个JSON-LD Object，包括6个部分（都是optional的）：\n\n1、DID标识符。\n\n2、一个加密材料的集合。比如公钥。\n\n3、一个加密协议的集合。\n\n4、一个服务端点的集合。\n\n5、时间戳。\n\n6、一个可选的JSON-LD签名。用来证明这个DID文档是合法的。\n\n文档内容示例：\n\n{\n\n\"@context\": \"https://w3id.org/did/v1\",\n\n\"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n\"authentication\": \\[{\n\n// used to authenticate as did:...fghi\n\n\"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1\",\n\n\"type\": \"RsaVerificationKey2018\",\n\n\"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n\"publicKeyPem\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\\\\r\\\\n\"\n\n}\\],\n\n\"service\": \\[{\n\n// used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID\n\n\"id\":\"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs\",\n\n\"type\": \"VerifiableCredentialService\",\n\n\"serviceEndpoint\": \"https://example.com/vc/\"\n\n}\\]\n\n}\n\n这里需要注意的是，DID文档中没有任何和你个人真实信息相关的内容，比如你的真实姓名、地址、手机号等。因此光靠DID规范是无法验证一个人的身份的，必须要靠DID应用层中的VC。\n\n**2. 可验证声明**\n\nW3C认为前面的DID规范是基础，而把可验证声明视作是next higher layer，并认为这一层才是建立DID整个体系的价值所在。因为在这个应用层中，DID既可以用来标识个体的身份、也可以用来标识组织的身份，甚至标识物品的身份。\n\n可验证声明类似于数字签名，要实现数字签名，需要有PKI体系，可验证声明也是一样，需要用一套系统来支持它。在可验证声明系统中，有以下几种参与者：\n\n\\*\\*发行者：\\*\\*拥有用户数据并能开具可验证声明的实体，如政府、银行、大学等机构和组织。\n\n**验证者**：接受可验证声明并进行验证，由此可以提供给出示可验证声明者某种类型的服务。\n\n\\*\\*持有者：\\*\\*向发行者请求、收到、持有可验证声明的实体。向验证者出示可验证声明。开具的可验证声明可以放在可验证声明钱包里，方便以后再次使用。\n\n\\*\\*标识符注册机构：\\*\\*维护去中心化身份数据库，如某条区块链、分布式账本。\n\n**五、 基于区块链技术的去中心化身份平台**\n\n**1.uPort**\n\nuPort是基于以太坊的分布式数字身份管理服务，它可以允许用户进行身份验证、无密登录、数字签名并和以太坊上的其它应用交互。\n\nuPort的整体架构由智能合约、开发者库和移动APP组成。其中移动APP持有用户的密钥。以太坊智能合约构成身份管理的核心，包括用户的uPort标识符管理、身份凭证的管理、以及可让用户在丢失移动设备时恢复身份的逻辑。开发者库可让第三方应用开发者把uPort集成到他们的应用中。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nuPort的底层基础设施是公有链以太坊。uPort DID方法已注册到W3C维护的注册表。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\nuPort智能合约设计体现了用户对数字身份的管理控制和使用。用户使用uPort DID登录其他在以太坊上注册的应用。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NkkszDQfGuZz-fUo5mA2X.jpeg?height=264&width=775)\n\n**uPort基于标识符的交互方式**\n\n**（1）标识符**\n\n其中，代理合约是用户数字身份的象征，uPort身份的核心标识符是代理合约的地址；控制合约，是代理合约的正式拥有者。\n\n控制合约维护了核心访问控制特性，包含密钥恢复和访问控制逻辑；控制合约由uPort移动App中安全存储的密钥进行控制。\n\n这种设计允许用户使用密钥向代理合约自我认证，并代表代理合约行事，有利于用户在保持标识符不变的情况下替换私钥。\n\n**（2）交互**\n\n应用DAPP与uPort App均使用了以太坊智能合约，代理合约可以向应用合约转发交易，并且通过这种机制，uPort身份与以太坊区块链上的其他智能合约进行交互。\n\n**（3）可验证凭证应用层**\n\nuPort的身份认证应用中的用户角色包含凭证发放机构、用户、应用、uPort共四方。\n\nuPort和凭证发布机构合作，凭证发放机构在以太坊网络上注册自己的身份，能够签署和验证数据；凭证发放机构在其应用中提供二维码信息以便于用户交互，用户使用uPort APP扫描二维码，向凭证发放机构注册自己的uPort ID。凭证发放机构根据业务需求按自己的方式认证用户信息，认证通过后向用户发放带有签名的身份凭证。\n\nuPort服务通过注册合约管理uPort ID和用户的身份凭证信息，每一个uPort身份标识符绑定了一个相关的链下数据结构（如：IPFS），身份凭证存储在链下。注册合约扮演逻辑上中心化，物理上去中心的注册表或查找表，将每一个uPort身份标识符映射到一个IPFS摘要上，这个IPFS摘要与包含了用户属性、个人数据、见证的结构相链接。只有uPort身份的所有者（设备密钥的持有者）才有权利去修改相对应的注册入口。\n\n用户注册新的应用时，应用通过二维码与用户交互，获取uPort ID和应用需要的凭证。如果用户注册合约中已经存储了相应的凭证，应用从uPort服务器获取该凭证进行验证。验证通过后，应用将uPort ID注册为用户账户，以后用户只需要使用uPort ID即可登录该应用。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nuPort没有提出新的治理框架，遵循了以太坊的治理模式，即通过以太币支付网络交易费用。\n\n**2.ENS**\n\n以太坊名称服务（ENS）是一种基础工具，可将任何以太坊地址转换为公共配置文件。它的主要工作是将人类可读的名称映射成机器可读的状态。你可以使用amberfin.eth，而不是使用一长串依靠人脑无从记忆的地址来进行交易。并且由于ENS的分层性质，拥有该域的任何人也可能拥有子域。\n\n例如，因为Amber Group拥有“amberfin.eth”它也可以创建“pay.amberfin.eth”。\n\n**Amber Group的ENS记录**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_nAD0Oatm3XJVfHx56Pey.png?height=432&width=640)\n\nENS的使用者继续增长。与ENS的完整DNS集成于今年8月启动，因此您可以将加密货币发送到“example.com”而不是“example.eth”。\n\n此外，.eth域名也可用于构建去中心化网站。例如，以太坊联合创始人Vitalik Buterin利用这种DNS集成以及IPFS在**https://vitalik.eth/创建了一个强大且抗审查的网站。**\n\nENS或许可以在去中心化身份的未来发挥关键作用。它被注册为DID表示，允许将ENS名称包装为DID以促进互通性。许多Web3用户已经使用ENS作为他们的标识符。\n\n一项对约300名以太坊用户的调查发现，约64%的人已经拥有ENS，链上分析表明，ENS用户平均拥有2.5个域名。随着其他功能的推出（例如NFT头像支持）和dApp越来越多地采用ENS，Web3用户很可能会越来越多地使用ENS作为他们在以太坊上的身份象征。\n\n**Uniswap 上的ENS名称：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L3ixRErtHlRSQdYVYko87.png?height=86&width=640)\n\n**ENS 生态系统如下：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2q_Tq6dZopAqlanz3pPyX.png?height=502&width=592)\n\n**3. Litentry**\n\nLitentry是一个波卡（Polkadot）生态去中心化跨链身份协议，为DeFi、链上治理等Polkadot生态内外的应用提供精细化的链上身份信用服务，在区块链网络中共同打造一个可信的去中心化身份聚合器，成为Web3.0网络中的重要基础设施，为大规模应用落地做好准备。\n\n2022年10月，Litentry完成数百万美元的种子轮融资；2022年初，推出了移动端App。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0XdvDVaXME261iX3UbNOl.png?height=441&width=1221)\n\nLitentry作为跨链身份聚合器旨在将不同链上数字身份的信息进行整合，创造一个链上的身份信用体系。Litentry构建的用户信用体系可以帮助项目方识别哪些是为项目做贡献、行为良好的用户，给予更多的权利与奖励。而用户本身也会为自身名誉和利益考虑，为区块链的发展做出更多有利的行为。\n\n相比于身份赛道的其他产品，基于波卡的Litentry拥有更庞大的生态基础，应用空间也更广阔。Litentry本身还具备公开、透明、自主更新等特点，任何人都可以参与其中，并且早期参与者还能够获得一定的通证激励。\n\n对于Litentry来说，现在最重要的是完成测试网的开发，以及在平行链插槽拍卖之前或者同时上线主网。\n\n**4. Sovrin**\n\nSovrin是Evernym初始开发、Sovrin基金会运营、Hyperledger孵化开源的一种用户自主主权身份和去中心化信任的协议，它致力于提供自我主权身份的去中心化的全球公共网络，该网络于2017年7月正式启动。\n\nSovrin是一种用户主权身份的基础设施和全球可互操作的身份协议，它不是一种具体的解决方案，不依赖于特定软件实现，不同的解决方案实现厂商可基于Sovrin协议和基础设施搭建具有互操作性的平台。Sovrin定义了分层的、解耦合、模块化的模型。\n\nSovrin基金会牵头推进了Hyperledger Indy项目，提供基于区块链或其他分布式账本技术的工具、代码库和模块化组件用于实现独立的数字主权身份。\n\n2019年，从Indy项目中独立出了Hyperledger Aries项目，用于实现其中的端到端交互。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nSovrin基金会管理了一个特定的账本SovrinLedger，由Stewards操作节点与Sovrin共识协议进行通信维护，但同时Sovrin协议可以运行在任何支持上面三层的分布式账本上，不依赖于一种特定的区块链或分布式账本技术，才能形成全球可互操作的用户主权身份网络。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\nSovrin支持基于DID进行点对点相互认证和安全通信，并且在HyperledgerAries项目中孵化一套标准化的端到端交互软件基础设施，Aries项目于2019年提出。\n\nAries的功能包括：建立和使用点对点连接，发送/接收点对点协议消息，并代表模块所代表的实体执行操作。它是Sovrin基础架构的基石，通过该模块，Sovrin实体形成连接并共享Sovrin身份。点对点连接是两个Sovrin实体之间关系的基本单位，由一对仅被双方实体知道的匿名标识符组成，这样可以最大限度地避免一个实体的多个标识符被第三方归集。\n\n**（3）可验证凭证应用层**\n\n基于零知识证明的匿名凭证技术实现了可验证凭证，支持凭证信息的最小化披露。支持对一个或多个凭证中的声明进行选择、组合并出示；凭证验证方不获得数据明文或密文，而仅获得数据的密码学验证方法，因此也无法复用它来模拟另一个用户。典型例子是在不揭示实际出生日期信息的情况下，出示有关年龄情况的证明（如“18岁以上”）。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nSovrin基金会发布了治理框架，建立用于自我主权身份的分布式网络所需的治理方法。框架定义了Sovrin网络所有成员同意遵守的商业、法律和技术术语，并且规定了Sovrin基金会和成员之间的法律合同。\n\n**5. 微软 DID**\n\n微软DID是一套基于Azure云服务的分布式数字身份技术架构和基础功能，让解决方案实施商可方便的在不同区块链上实现分布式数字身份整体解决方案。微软是DIF联盟的重要成员，以标准的开源技术、协议和参考实现为主要目标。\n\n微软DID的技术架构包括区块链BAAS服务、注册DID的Layer2方法ION、隐私数据管理模块Identity Hub，均以API的形式为开发者提供服务，ION和Identity Hub还提供了开源软件。在未实现的计划中，还包括手机端的身份管理模块。\n\n通过区块链BAAS服务向不同区块链注册分布式数字身份标识，可以成为广泛使用的中间层，实现DIF的互联互通目标。\n\nION方法是SideTree协议基于比特币网络的实现，用于解决向公有链注册DID存在的效率低下问题。\n\nIdentity Hub为开发者提供了管理用户隐私数据的基础模块。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\n微软DID的基础设施不依赖于特定的分布式账本。与Azure区块链服务的设计思想一脉相承，微软DID依托于Azure云服务支持多种分布式账本协议，并且注册了基于该分布式账本的DID操作方法，对开发者隐藏分布式账本的接入细节，提供Restful API接口。\n\n**目前微软DID支持以下两个DID操作方法：**\n\n1、Ion-test：注册到比特币测试网络\n\n2、test：注册到微软数据库\n\n**同时正在开发对以下三个分布式账本的支持：**\n\n1、比特币正式网络\n\n2、通过uport的DID方法，注册到以太坊\n\n3、通过Sovrin的DID方法，注册到Sovrin网络\n\n在DID注册和查询过程中，为解决公链效率低下的问题，微软DIF联盟的几个成员发起了SideTree协议，**构建了L1层公链和L2层DID操作的分层架构：**\n\n1、L2层保存了DID操作的源数据并推送到IPFS网络，汇聚尽可能多的DID操作后锚定到L1层。\n\n2、L2层的每个“节点”各自与L1层同步，获取 Sidetree锚定交易后，拉取DID操作源数据。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fnsKT84YImRSw1C8Qkr42.jpeg?height=901&width=800)\n\n                                                             SideTree架构\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互&可验证凭证应用**\n\n微软DID中未提供完整的DID交互和可验证凭证应用软件，由开发者根据自己需求进行设计。微软DID主要为开发者提供了Identity Hub模块，它的目标是为用户存储和管理隐私数据，以增强数据表达能力的“语义数据模型”实现。在DIF的认可下，已发布了第一版开源代码。与传统的数据存储解决方案相比，Identity Hub具有去中心化的特性：\n\n**1、标准化接口：**Hub的实现厂商需要满足标准化的数据存取接口，包括为每个用户的Hub注册DID，不同用户的Hub通过DID标识符进行互操作。\n\n**2、开源：**通过开源代码，鼓励开发者运营自己的Hub。\n\nIdentity Hub支持与用户通过DID进行点对点的安全通信，遵循DIDAuth的相互认证和加密传输。\n\n**6. WeIdentity**\n\nWeIdentity是基于联盟链的可信数据交换解决方案，它是一套基于FISCO-BCOS区块链底层平台的解决方案，也是BCOS联盟链的应用场景。联盟链为各用户角色提供了接入中心，为数据交换提供了数据存证和验证功能。\n\nWeIdentity中的用户角色包括凭证发行者、凭证验证者、用户代理和用户共四种，其中用户代理一般为权威可信机构，为用户KYC并生成数字身份标识符，用户的数字身份和隐私数据托管于用户代理中。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nWeIdentity基于微众银行的FISCO-BCOS联盟链实现，其整体架构具有明显的联盟链特征。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\n用户的数字身份标识符、个人数据均托管于用户代理中，由用户代理与凭证发行方和凭证验证方进行通信。\n\n因此，用户与其它实体之间的通信均通过用户代理进行转接。用户代理由场景选择，一个场景中一般具有一个用户代理，这个用户代理成为一个联盟链网络中的中心转接点。\n\n本方案中的数字身份标识符等同于联盟链中的身份合约，是一条链上的唯一标识，提供了链上行为的可验证和追溯特性。由于用户的实体身份和标识符通过用户代理机构绑定，用户行为可查可归集。\n\n**（3）应用层**\n\n应用层是WeIdentity解决方案的重点，以可验证凭证数据模型规范作为标准的数据组织方式并进行分享。其目的是借助区块链实现可信数据的交换，提供直接出示和链上授权两种方式。\n\n1）直接出示\n\n2）链上授权（适合用于用户代理也不能保存数据原文的情况）\n\n**.**凭证发行方产生凭证，同时上链存证凭证摘要。\n\n**.**用户向凭证验证方发行一个授权凭证，并上链存证授权凭证摘要。\n\n**.**凭证验证方向凭证发行方请求数据，出示用户授权凭证，凭证发行方进行验证。\n\n**.**验证通过后，凭证发行方与凭证验证方建立数据传输通道进行数据传输。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nWeIdentity是基于场景落地的联盟链解决方案，治理方式也具有明显的联盟链特征。\n\n联盟链中，新成员加入都需要进行KYC。个人用户通过用户代理机构进行KYC和业务接入，比如使用用户代理机构提供的身份管理工具App；机构用户可通过部署区块链节点、或通过业务发起方提供开放平台的方式接入联盟链。\n\n除用户代理外，系统中还有一类具有特殊权限的权威机构。链上每个WeIdentity DID持有者（包括人，机构，或者物）都可以成为凭证发行者，但只有联盟链里面的权威机构才可以注册成为 Authority Issuer。每个注册为 AuthorityIssuer的新成员需要联盟链内其他机构投票通过。\n\n系统中还有一些联盟链的内部治理角色，如系统管理员、机构委员会等。WeIdentity的角色权限管理通过智能合约实现，不同类型的合约角色分配不同的权限。\n\n**7. Ceramic**\n\nCeramic Network是一个去中心化的、世界性的、运行Ceramic协议的节点网络，通过Libp2p点对点网络协议的专用主题进行通信。Ceramic自称由于其独特的设计，系统能够实现目前最好的水平可扩展性、吞吐量和性能。\n\nCeramic为开发者提供了类似数据库的功能，用于存储各种动态、可变的内容。这最终为开发者提供了一种Web3原生的方式，让他们可以为Dapp添加一些关键功能，如丰富的身份信息（档案、声誉、社交图表）、用户生成的内容（帖子、互动）、动态应用数据等等。\n\n在Ceramic上，每条信息都表示为一个提交日志，称为stream。每个stream都是存储在IPLD中的有向无环图 (DAG)，具有StreamID的不可变名称和StreamState的可验证状态。stream在概念上类似于Git tree，每个流都可以被视为自己的区块链、账本或事件日志。Tile Documents是一种Ceramic StreamType，经常用作身份数据（例如，个人资料、社交图、链接的社交帐户）、用户生成的内容（例如，博客文章、社交媒体）、DID文档等。\n\n该协议不依赖于任何特定的区块链。相反，它可以被概念化为“文档链”，其中验证特定文档的状态只需要用户同步文档的数据。用户不需要像大多数区块链网络（比特币、以太坊）那样同步整个网络状态。\n\nCeramic的一个关键工具是IDX，这是一种跨链身份协议，它提供了一个统一的存储库，所有应用程序都可以在其中注册和发现与用户的DID关联的数据。它可以被认为是一个去中心化的用户表。\n\n因此，IDX允许用户控制他们的身份和数据，而无需锁定任何单个应用程序，并轻松保护和跨应用程序移植他们的数据。同时，它允许开发人员构建数据丰富的应用程序，而无需强迫用户在每个应用程序上重新创建相同的数据。\n\n**（1）Sharded execution environment — 分片式执行环境**\n\n传统的区块链系统的可扩展性被限制在一个单一的全球虚拟执行环境（VM），并且单一节点的账本的状态在所有节点之间共享。\n\n与此不同的是，每个Ceramic节点作为一个单独的执行环境，用于执行计算和验证流的交易（这意味着没有全局账本）。这种\"内置的\"执行分片方法使Ceramic网络能够横向扩展，随着网络上节点数量的增加，可以对越来越多的同时进行的流交易进行并行处理。\n\n这样的设计能处理的数据规模比金融区块链上所需的吞吐量要大几个数量级。同时这种设计的另一个好处是，Ceramic Network的节点可以在离线的环境中执行数据流的交易，然后在它重新上线后与网络的其他部分的节点们同步更新。\n\n**（2）Global namespace — 全局的命名空间**\n\n由于所有的节点都是同一个Ceramic网络的一部分，Ceramic上的每一个流都存在于一个单一的全局命名空间中，它可以被任何其他节点访问或被任何其他数据流所引用。这创造了一个开放源码信息的公共数据网。\n\nCeramic的特性使静态文件能够被重组成高阶可变的数据结构，进而能够被编程为任何所需的形式，并且把结果的状态存储和复制在一个去中心化的节点网络中。Ceramic通过使用一个通用的去中心化内容计算基底，建立并扩展了IPFS文件系统和底层持久性网络，以及去中心化生态系统中的其他开放标准。\n\n**（3）Stream数据流存储实现方式概述：**\n\n系统中用户唯一的身份标识被定义为DID（去中心化的身份ID decentralized identifier）。系统使用将DID对应的所有数据流Stream信息以NoSQL的形式进行处理、存储、管理。存储信息有下面几种类型：\n\n1、Tile Document，存储JSON文件。可以被用作身份数据（档案、社交图、声誉分数、社交账户链接）、用户生成的内容（博客文章、社交媒体等）、以及聚合索引以形成集合和用户表（IDX）、DID文档、可验证的索赔等数据库替代。Tile Document仅依靠DID进行验证，对流的所有有效更新必须由控制该流的DID签署，也就是说，更新这些信息必须要用户手动授权才能完成。\n\n2、CAIP-10 Link，关联用户在任何平台和区块链上的钱包地址。它存储了一个可加密验证的身份证明，将一个区块链地址与一个DID联系起来。一个DID可以有无限数量的CAIP-10链接，将其与许多不同的区块链网络上的许多不同地址绑定。CAIP-10链接的管理也依靠DID进行验证，与Tile Document相同。\n\n3、自定义类型。除了上述2种默认类型，用户/开发者还可以自定义StreamType，并且并将其部署到自己的Ceramic Network节点。\n\n**（4）Stream数据流的授权管理方法：**\n\n1、3ID DID Method通常用于普通用户的账户。主要使用Ceramic的Tile Document 的StreamType来表示一个动态的DID文件。当3ID与IDX和3ID钥匙链结合使用时（如3ID Connect中实现的那样），一个3ID可以很容易地与任何L1或L2网络的任何数量的区块链账户进行控制。这提供了一种在所有其他平台上统一用户身份的方法。\n\n2、Key DID Method。通常用于开发者账户。一种从任何Ed25519密钥对静态生成的DID方法。密钥DID是轻量级的，但缺点是它的DID文件是不可改变的，如果它被破坏，没有能力重置密钥。\n\n3、NFT DID Method（即将推出）。用NFT的所有权作为认证，只能被其当前拥有者控制的方法。用CAIP-10 Link追踪到NFT的当前拥有者，被控制权会随当NFT的所有权发生变化时而改变。是一个适用于任何区块链上的任何NFT的DID方法。DID文件是由链上数据静态生成的。\n\n4、Safe DID Method（即将推出）。通常用于团队组织、DAO和其他多重签名钱包的实体。在任何区块链上的通过Gnosis多重签名钱包才可以控制的方法。\n\n**（5）网络中节点的职责：**\n\n1、上述的根据数据流类型的逻辑执行数据流交易。（核心职责）\n\n2、StreamState数据流状态存储。一个Ceramic节点只为它所关心的数据流保存数据流状态，这种维护过程称为 \"pinning（钉住）\"。不同的节点将为不同的数据流维护状态，但多个节点可以维护一个数据流的状态。\n\n3、提交日志存储。一个Ceramic节点维护一份它所pinning的数据流所有提交的交易的本地副本。\n\n4、持久性接口（Persistence connectors）。Ceramic节点可以选择利用一个额外的持久性存储后端来备份它正在钉住的数据流的交易。包括Filecoin、Arweave、Sia等持久性网络。\n\n5、查询响应。节点对来自客户端的流查询做出响应。如果节点有钉住数据流，它将返回响应；如果没有，它将通过libp2p向网络的其他部分询问流，然后返回响应。\n\n6、广播交易。当一个Ceramic节点成功地在一个数据流上执行了一个交易，它就会通过libp2p向网络的其他部分广播这个交易，这样其他同样钉住这个数据流的节点就可以更新他们的数据流状态来记录这个新的交易。\n\nCeramic是DID技术堆栈中的关键。一些建立在Ceramic网络并已经具有吸引力和市场契合度的项目包括：\n\n1、Boardroom：DAO的治理管理平台，使用Ceramic的平台存储提案。\n\n2、Rabbithole：通过允许人们赚取积分和加密货币来鼓励人们使用Web3项目的应用程序。Rabbithole使用Ceramic的网络将多个Web2和Web3帐户链接到一个统一的跨链DID中，并允许用户的声誉跨越其他Web3应用程序。\n\n3、ArcX：一个去中心化的应用程序，通过发行“DeFi护照”来提供链上信用评分和身份。\n\n**六 、总结与展望**\n\n微软的首席身份架构师Kim Cameron曾说，“互联网是没有身份层的”，因为互联网的寻址系统基于识别网络上的物理端点(机器)，而人并不是网络上的端点。因此，互联网没有办法唯一地识别人的身份。\n\n区块链技术的发展，帮助人们重新思考身份识别和认证的解决方案，通过使用去中心化标识符、可验证声明等技术来解决互联网身份层缺失的困境。\n\n同时，在微软、Facebook等互联网巨头的推动下，基于区块链技术的去中心化身份管理系统，将会是区块链技术应用落地最早的领域之一。\n\n相比传统数字身份系统，**去中心化数字身份具有隐私保护、可控安全、持久可用、分散化等特点，**基于属性的授权访问方式能够更好的支持开放环境下灵活的访问策略。短短几年时间，已取得了丰富的规范和技术标准化研究成果。\n\n随着标准化成果的继续拓展，未来越来越多的应用可方便、安全的切换到分布式数字身份基础设施上来，形成互联互通的互联网身份网络。\n\n随着互联网价值的涌现，我们需要强大的DID解决方案引入新的用例、来让Web3成为主流。虽然于早期阶段，但未来是光明的。并且由于DID标准的可组合性和互通性，每个新型应用带来的能量具有涟漪效应。\n\n我们预计DID解决方案将在未来几年内迅速走入大众视野，并开启Web3应用程序的下一个周期。\n\n**免责声明：本文分享内容仅作学习交流，不构成任何投资建议。**", "timestamp": 1654769416, "digest": "F3AroTTo1cgxnr8NtyJXRfP43JisZ4zjvtW2sbkP270", "contributor": "0x251C9aBcF97B5135C7eB68D1B0E0f0C8D2e48ea2"}

I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. Editions can be purchased using the ‘collect’ button at the top of this interview. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654769485, "digest": "58-fqpvgoNOVx14Dui5jokK6gmjACcJW9i_mrd61FTw", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}
{"id": "q60pz19PF-zKpS2QM_yMtxpdR1Cj5m9NUN5oB4ROGMA", "title": "Running Perp-maker for Profits & Fun: Part 1", "body": "[Perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker) is an open-source market-making template for [Perpetual Protocol v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post), the most popular dApp on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/apps/defi) *(a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum)*. Anyone can use or modify the template to facilitate trades on the protocol and earn fees.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll go over what Perpetual Protocol is, the risks and rewards associated with running the bot, and how to run it locally. Due to the length of this article, we’ll cover how to run the bot on AWS and further modification suggestions in part 2. Stay tuned!\n\n## Perpetual Protocol 101\n\nFirst thing first, what is Perpetual Protocol?\n\nPerpetual Protocol is a decentralized derivative exchange (DEX) where traders can use USDC *(a USD-pegged stablecoin)* to speculate on cryptocurrency’s price movement with up to 10x leverage. At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more! You can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6KeGLlSsa-3SOSv_-S-k1.png?height=806&width=1370)\n\n### But What does “Market-making” Mean?\n\nWhenever a trade happens, there will always be two sides involved - a taker and a maker. The takers initiate a trade, and the makers provide the inventory to let the taker take.\n\nHere is a real-life example. When buying a fish from a vendor, you’re the taker of this trade as you’re the one that takes what the vendor supplies. As for the vendor, he is the maker of this trade as he prepares the inventory (fish in this example) that makes this trade possible.\n\nSimilarly, being a market-maker, or “maker,” on Perp v2 means you [provide the liquidity](https://blog.perp.fi/how-to-provide-liquidity-on-perp-v2-9064ed085d7f) (the assets) that traders can take, making the market viable. In return, you receive 80% of the transaction fees paid by the trader. For instance, if a trader opens a long position and this trade happens in the price range you set, you act as the other side of the trade - i.e., opening a short position as a result, and vice versa.\n\nMakers on Perp v2 can choose the price range to which they provide liquidity. For instance, in the screenshot below, this user wants to provide liquidity to the BTC market with a price range of $9,991.99 to $60,081.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb5f4JjKvWmd88x2iwT2L.png?height=806&width=1370)\n\nWhenever a trade happens in that range, this user collects 80% of the transaction fees proportionately. One thing worth pointing out is that USDC is the only asset you need to deposit to start market-making on Perp v2. Once you deposit some USDC, the system will mint the virtual tokens (0.1 vBTC and 4316.31 vUSD in the screenshot) you need to trade or market-make with.\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-maker\n\nWith perp-maker, anyone can automate their market-making strategy on Perp v2 to earn transaction fees and liquidity mining rewards *(more on this later)*.\n\n**Out of the box, perp-maker lets you choose which market you want to provide liquidity to and within what price range**. As a reminder, if the market price moves out of the price range you set, you will not collect any transaction fees until it moves back in the range. **Perp-maker can automatically adjust your liquidity and realize the [impermanent loss](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3) when the market price reaches the price level you set.**\n\n### But What is Impermanent Loss?\n\nOn Perp v2, makers act as the other side of each trade. If a trader makes a profit, a maker loses money. This loss is impermanent as it will become 0 when the market price returns to the initial price. Even if the market price moves away from the initial price, you can collect fees if the market price stays in the price range.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4T-vCemGHAoAu6SYZnmjR.png?height=1012&width=1908)\n\nAs a rule of thumb, **the wider the price range you set, the less [impermanent loss](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3) you suffer; however, the less transaction fees you can collect. And the more transaction fees generated on a market, the better for you as a maker.** You can use the [Perpetual Simulator](https://defi-lab-test-vhee9.ondigitalocean.app/perpetualsimulator) to simulate different price ranges in any given market to gauge the profitability of your strategy.\n\nAdditionally, **the developers behind the protocol provide its token, known as $PERP, as an extra reward to encourage more people to be makers**. This reward is distributed weekly proportional to the transaction fees you collect for that market. **This weekly reward is known as liquidity mining rewards.**\n\nTo recap - **if the transaction fees plus liquidity mining rewards outweigh the impermanent loss, it’s a profitable strategy**. If not, it can still be a profitable strategy over a more extended timeframe as it takes time for the combined value of the fees and liquidity mining rewards to catch up with the impermanent loss.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n*If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot using the readme in the [perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.*\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned how Perp v2 works and the risks and rewards of being a maker on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a perp-maker on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6QOtvjcuMi36QkSCyQLfm.png?height=1062&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer:\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N4a5KHu_9C987ll57Uyxt.png?height=782&width=1370)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node’ is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZqQ1j9QNzMjFhO46GrGPM.png?height=980&width=1024)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-maker repo and build it locally. You can do it with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker.git`\n\n`cd perp-maker`\n\n`npm i`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything works properly, you should see something on your terminal that’s similar to what’s displayed below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dIWmLkTfy6EDqLNK3H5On.png?height=496&width=1372)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mBbPh3b35FiRWt5KwFPlY.png?height=808&width=1370)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Modify .env file\n\nYou need to add a web3 endpoint and your wallet’s private key to the .env file in your perp-maker folder. Here is what it looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4-JyvjGUDUWHpm33uiKpm.png?height=872&width=1370)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).** For testing purposes, you should get an endpoint for “Optimism Kovan”, not “Optimism Mainnet” or “Kovan”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m4tW5ytUsE7qwyP66q3bt.png?height=802&width=1370)\n\n*If you’re wondering what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider e.g. Infura will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.*\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.” Similar to recovery phrases, you should never share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sXTYNdQbm1Irp0oiHOB7l.png?height=1032&width=608)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* ADJUST_MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI: The maximum gas fee in Gwei which the bot will adjust liquidity. If the gas price exceeds this number, the liquidity won't be adjusted. Currently, the gas price on Optimism is fixed at 0.001 Gwei.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to \\`true\\` to enable this market.\n* LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT:How much vUSD (after leverage) to provide as liquidity. Perp v2 supports up to 10x leverage, meaning that you can use up to 10x of your deposited USDC to provide liquidity.\n* LIQUIDITY_RANGE_OFFSET: The offset to upper price and lower price of the liquidity range. For example, if it’s set to 0.05, it will provide liquidity from (current price / 1.05) to (current price \\* 1.05).\n* LIQUIDITY_ADJUST_THRESHOLD: The threshold that the bot will remove your existing liquidity, realize the impermanent loss, and place a new price range. For example, if it’s set to 0.01, the bot will remove your existing liquidity when the current price goes out of the range below (initial price/ 1.01) or above (the initial price\\* 1.01), and subsequently provides liquidity with a new price range based on LIQUIDITY_RANGE_OFFSET and the current price.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally on Optimism Kovan (testnet)\n\nYou need to get some test tokens before running the bot on Optimism testnet. Head to [Optifaucet](https://kovan.optifaucet.com/), type in your wallet address *(which starts with 0x)* and send out the request.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/472eL25IaWpOqyc8sth44.png?height=718&width=1230)\n\n*If you run out of the test ETH to pay for transactions, you can go to [Paradigm’s faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to request more test ETH and then bridge them to Optimism Kovan via [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).*\n\nWe’re almost ready! The bot by default is set to run on Optimism. To run on Optimism Kovan, you need to add an endpoint for the testnet (as demonstrated above) and comment *(add two “slashes” before the codes)* the two lines below in the index.ts file which is located in the src folder.\n\n`// process.env[\"STAGE\"] = \"production\"`\n\n`// process.env[\"NETWORK\"] = \"optimism\"`\n\nFor Windows users, you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file:\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv):\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal to do it:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gcsUq-i2kMpXkbpk-f3d.png?height=372&width=1374)\n\nAnother way to validate if the template runs successfully is to check the target markets in the pool section on the UI. For testnet *(Optimism Kovan)*, please visit [testnet.perp.exchange](https://testnet.perp.exchange/); As for mainnet *(Optimism)*, visit [app.perp.com](https://app.perp.com/).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wTbtDlx5qj7XnJaxGMRs1.png?height=764&width=1374)\n\nAlright!

I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. Editions can be purchased using the ‘collect’ button at the top of this interview. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654769589, "digest": "58-fqpvgoNOVx14Dui5jokK6gmjACcJW9i_mrd61FTw", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}

{"id": "grBJMX1SysuQBPqHfXxJd9Oe-jng6kIQQJ7hDvH21sw", "title": "Arbitraging Between DEXes and CEXes for Profits & Fun", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oVM09P-0E8Gi-T1conx-Y.png?height=1012&width=1908)\n\n[Perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur) is an open-sourced template that automatically executes your arbitrage strategy between Perpetual Protocol v2 “Curie” and FTX.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll cover what [Perpetual Protocol v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) is, the risks and rewards of running this bot, how you can run it on your computer and on AWS, and further modification suggestions.\n\n## Perpetual Protocol 101\n\nPerpetual Protocol, or Perp v2 “Curie” specifically, is a decentralized derivative exchange (DEX) on [Optimism](https://optimism.io) where traders can use USDC *(a USD-backed stablecoin)* to speculate on cryptocurrency’s price movement with up to 10x leverage. You can open a long position if you believe one asset’s price will go up or open short positions if you expect it will go down. At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17around 20 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J8zu2hqPwpMn4gBJxvyZO.png?height=790&width=1370)\n\nYou can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-curie-arbitrageur\n\nThe way **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)** works is that, whenever there is a price difference between [Perp v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) (a derivative DEX) and [FTX](https://ftx.com/) (a CEX), the bot will buy on the cheaper side and sell on the more expensive side. Out of the box, this template allows you to set the desired price difference for the bot to take action. Additionally, you can specify the markets for the bot to run the arbitrage strategy.\n\nOf course, we can’t just look at the rewards. How about the risks associated with running this bot?\n\nThe main risk is liquidation, which can happen when you use too much leverage to trade on either Perp v2 or FTX. Luckily, the bot lets you set the margin ratio you’re comfortable with, which is the reciprocal of leverage, and it will start to reduce the position sizes whenever the margin ratio is reached.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n***If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot by the readme in the [perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.***\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned what Perp v2 is and the risks and rewards of running an arbitraging bot on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a bot on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35K8a0HNOpAgrqyZe8-9u.png?height=1056&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer.\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmWcwfTH5meqjcgJXX42B.png?height=772&width=1368)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FG5l25__gsXRy2WqTwan9.png?height=976&width=1026)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-curie-arbitrageur repo and build it locally. You can do so with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur.git`\n\n`cd perp-curie-arbitrageur`\n\n`npm install`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything goes well, you should be able to see responses like the ones below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oHajKZfB6oCOvhrfk_ln.png?height=420&width=1366)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances, especially those who claim to be part of a customer service team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AZkHnVO2PIpDf7g12I2Ix.png?height=808&width=1366)\n\n## Get the Tokens you Need\n\nThere are two tokens we need in order to run perp-curie-arbitrageur. They are ETH and USDC. **Please be aware that, since there is no test account on FTX, we’ll be using real ETH and USDC in the following**. It’s better to start with a small amount to get comfortable with it and then increase from there.\n\n* **For ETH**:\n\n  If you only use CEXes like Binance or FTX, you can use [LayerSwap](https://www.layerswap.io/) to transfer some of your ETH to Optimism. If you have ETH on chains like Ethereum or BNB Chain, you can use [TransferTo.xyz](https://transferto.xyz/swap) to bridge your ETH to Optimism. **ETH is used to pay the gas fees for your transactions** and each transaction on Perp v2 costs around 0.001 ETH, so even 0.1 ETH can be used for a long time.\n* **For USDC**:\n\n  Similar to ETH, you can use either LayerSwap or TransferTo depending on how much you want to transfer and from where. And as mentioned above, **USDC is used as the collateral for your positions**.\n\nAlso, because by default, MetaMask doesn’t include Optimism in the network list, you need to go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to add Optimism to your MetaMask to see your ETH and USDC balance in your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni590TmTaReallO5-aRV6.png?height=764&width=1366)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Rename the .env.example file to .env and modify it\n\nYou need to rename the .env.example file in the root folder of perp-curie-arbitrageur to .env and add a web3 endpoint, your wallet’s private key, and everything related to FTX to it. Here is what your .env file looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TBM7eUvmNl8RN63gTvlWy.png?height=386&width=1366)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint for Optimism, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)**. If you wonder what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider, e.g. Infura, will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/74kJqYT6TE7k7ntWyKUE8.png?height=796&width=1366)\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.”  Similar to recovery phrases, you should **never** share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uI8QlZXgLQLdkFhHl6ucq.png?height=950&width=560)\n\nAs for FTX’s API key and secret, you can generate them by going to the [API page](https://ftx.com/settings/api) of your subaccount and clicking \"Create API Key”. The permission should be “Trading” only.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XQOmbcYNb_-sCsYEVNr-c.png?height=454&width=820)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* BALANCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check your balance on FTX and your address.\n* ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH:\n* BALANCE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH: The maximum amount of gas fees in ETH that you’re willing to pay to do arbitrage. One thing worth pointing out is that , Optimism uses the first-comes, first-served approach to process transactions, meaning that increasing the ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH will not confirm any faster.\n* PERP_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO: As we mentioned above, the margin ratio is the metric to show how many leverages you use. The lower this metric, the easier for your position to get liquidated.  If you set them as 0.2, then the max leverage is 5x. Recommended to start from 1 to be safe.\n* PERP_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO: The margin ratio threshold when the positions on both platforms will start to be reduced. For instance, if you set them as 0.1 here, that means your positions will begin to be closed when your leverage reaches 10x. Recommended to begin with a number that is closer to 1 to start with.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_AMOUNT: 9000,\n  The USD value of the position that the bot should start to close when the emergency margin ratio is reached.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_SLEEP_SEC: The interval between each emergency reduction should be.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency that emergency checks should be conducted.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to true to enable this market.\n* FTX_MARKET_NAME: The name of the market on FTX. Usually, if it’s a perpetual market, then it’ll follow a naming convention of ticker-perp. For instance, BTC’s perpetual market is known as BTC-PERP on FTX.\n* ORDER_AMOUNT: Order amount in USDC for each trade. Remember to top up your account before running the bot.\n* SHORT_TRIGGER_SPREAD:\n* LONG_TRIGGER_SPREAD: The price difference threshold between both platforms at which the bot should start executing your strategy.\n* IS_EMERGENCY_REDUCE_MODE_ENABLED:\n  Whether (or not) the bot should reduce positions when the leverage is too high.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. However, the bot can support up to 5 markets simultaneously. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally\n\nThere is one extra step for Windows users - you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file otherwise it can’t read the parameters in your .env file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully on your machine, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5Go3tdgnLsHOHaraBjw0.png?height=564&width=1022)\n\n## Run on AWS Lambda\n\n*If you’re not familiar with AWS Lambda, you can watch this video to [learn more about it (or serverless in general) in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_VV2Fx32_Y&ab_channel=Fireship). But in general, the main selling point of AWS’ Lambda is that, instead of renting a dedicated server on AWS to run your program 24/7. You only pay the times when your application runs on a shared server, which is more suitable for our use case as the bot only runs from time to time based on your settings.*\n\nAs a starter for this section, **you need to register an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and install AWS CLI on your machine**. Check the installation instructions for each OS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).\n\n**Once AWS CLI is installed, you need to [configure your AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) by running the following command** in your Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows):\n\n`aws configure`\n\nThen you need to type your access key and secret. You can create them from the [Identity and Access Management page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oY3trcl2-nanWI5PxCV5L.png?height=258&width=1178)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YStXJ4AHlHEkI_b9QQTuw.png?height=686&width=1218)\n\nDepending on your settings, sometimes you need to create a new user on AWS to generate a key. To do so, you need to click Users on the Identity and Access Management page and then create a new user with permission to manage Lambda.\n\n**Following this, you need to type the AWS region you use in the .env file in your perp-curie-arbitrageur folder**. For instance, add AWS_REGION=ap-southest-1 to the file if you choose a server located in Singapore.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i13sUcuIHcQhUTzwfacHo.png?height=686&width=1228)\n\nAlso, for Windows users who have run the bot locally in the previous sections, you need to remove the two lines that you added in the index.ts file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nBy now we’re all set! Enter the following commands in your terminal to deploy the bot to AWS:\n\n`npm run build`\n\n`npm run sls:deploy`\n\nYou should be able to see the following responses if everything goes well:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HgxYHicK9JFy_6nU9HplL.png?height=490&width=1228)\n\nOnce your bot is running, you can see the real-time logs by going to the *perp-arbitrageur-production-main* Lambda function on AWS and clicking the “View logs in CloudWatch” under the Monitor tab. You should be able to see similar logs when running the bot on your computer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KmdiO6etAAGga9RGrOsYr.png?height=716&width=1228)\n\nCongratulations! Your bot is now automatically arbitraging the price difference between Perp v2 and FTX!\n\n## Further Modification Suggestions\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article, this bot is just a template for arbitraging between Perp v2 and FTX. Given the nature of an open-sourced software, anyone can add functionalities to this bot. Below are some directions that you can explore:\n\n* **Support more DEXes and CEXes**\n\n  You can modify the bot to support for CEXs like Binance or Huobi to discover more arbitraging opportunities. It also applies to derivative DEXs as there are numerous of them on the market.\n* **Better position wind down process**\n\n  Currently, the bot will close positions from both exchanges when the margin ratio reaches the limit you set. A better approach to wind down positions should be closing both sides when the prices on both exchanges are the same and do it gradually to reduce price impact aka slippage per trade.\n* **Error or success report**\n\n  Right now the bot only does its job quietly and you can only check CloudWatch to know its status. One way to improve this is to add a script to send out a Telegram or Discord message when certain criteria are met. For instance, you can write a script to send out Telegram messages when a trade is successful.\n\nThat’s the end of our tutorial on how to run **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)**!\n\n**Besides this tutorial, recently we also have released tutorials on how to run [perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker)!** Feel free to check them out.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/LWB40sjbmk4R34eq2ZD88vm466wAZ7iiskalKWGVPXc](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/LWB40sjbmk4R34eq2ZD88vm466wAZ7iiskalKWGVPXc)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/Om0vxOZKa3LTp22_fVhzMxrVPZ2blticcdmPzIrjkj4](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/Om0vxOZKa3LTp22_fVhzMxrVPZ2blticcdmPzIrjkj4)\n\n**One last thing - we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) on our Discord for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.

The validators grow the blockchain by executing transactions, producing blocks and achieving consensus. The rest of the peers in the network (e.g., fullnodes and clients) replicate the blockchain data produced by the validators (e.g., blocks and transactions). State sync is the protocol that allows non-validator peers to distribute, verify and persist this blockchain data and ensures that all peers in the ecosystem are synchronized. See the diagram below for what this looks like at Aptos.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XesMBhS5rLVIiluTme0nlw.png)\n\nAptos Ecosystem (Overview)\n\n## Why does state sync matter?\n\nState sync is rarely mentioned when evaluating blockchains: it is often a footnote in a whitepaper dedicated to more interesting topics\\*. However, state sync has significant consequences on blockchain performance, security, and user experience. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Time to finality and user experience:** When new transactions are executed by validators, state sync is responsible for propagating the data to peers and clients. If state sync is slow or unreliable, peers will perceive long transaction processing delays, artificially inflating the time to finality. This has a huge impact on user experience, e.g., decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and payment processing will all be much slower.\n2. **Relationship with consensus:** Validators that crash or fall behind the rest of the validator set rely on state sync to bring them back up to speed (i.e., synchronize the latest blockchain state). If state sync cannot process transactions as quickly as they are executed by consensus, crashed validators will never be able to recover. Moreover, new validators will never be able to start participating in consensus (as they won’t ever catch up!) and fullnodes will never be able to sync to the latest state (they’ll continue to fall further behind!).\n3. **Implications on decentralization**: Having a quick, efficient and scalable state sync protocol allows for: (i) faster rotations of an active validator set, as validators can move in and out of consensus more freely; (ii) more potential validators to choose from in the network; (iii) more fullnodes to come online quickly and without having to wait long periods of time; and (iv) lower resource requirements, increasing heterogeneity. All of these factors increase decentralization in the network and help to scale the blockchain in size and geography.\n4. **Data correctness**: State sync is responsible for verifying the correctness of all blockchain data during synchronization. This prevents malicious peers and adversaries in the network from modifying, censoring or fabricating transaction data and presenting it as valid. If state sync fails to do this (or does it incorrectly), fullnodes and clients could be tricked into accepting invalid data and this would have devastating consequences on the network.\n\n## Reasoning about state sync\n\nTo better reason about state sync, we first introduce a generic model for blockchain execution. While this model targets the Aptos blockchain specifically, it can be generalized to others.\n\nWe model the Aptos blockchain as a simple versioned database, where at each version **V** there is a unique blockchain state **Sⱽ** containing all on-chain accounts and resources. A transaction **T** can be executed by the Aptos virtual machine (VM) on state **Sⱽ** to produce a state delta \\*\\*Dᵀᵥ \\*\\*representing all state modifications that would occur on \\*\\*Sⱽ \\*\\*should \\*\\*T \\*\\*be committed. When **Dᵀᵥ** is applied to **Sⱽ** (that is, we consider **T** committed), it results in a new version **V+1** and a new blockchain state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We refer to the very first blockchain state as the genesis state **S⁰**. The diagrams below show transaction execution and state delta application.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZwNwY2c1kg8mYrQ-pmHziA.png)\n\nTransaction Execution and State Delta Application (Model)\n\n## What are the goals?\n\nWith a generic model in place, we can now define several fundamental goals for state sync\\*\\*:\n\n1. **High-throughput**: State sync should maximize the amount of transactions that can be synchronized by each peer per second. That is, maximize the rate of state transitions from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹** for each \\*\\*T \\*\\*committed by the validators. If throughput is low it increases syncing time and becomes a bottleneck for the network.\n2. **Low latency**: State sync should minimize the time it takes up-to-date peers to synchronize new transactions committed by validators. That is, minimize the time it takes peers at **Sⱽ** to sync to **Sⱽ⁺¹**, for each **T** that is newly committed by the validators. This affects the overall time to finality perceived by clients.\n3. **Fast bootstrapping time**: State sync should minimize the time it takes new (or crashed) peers to sync to the latest state of the blockchain. That is, minimize the time it takes to sync to \\*\\*Sⱽ \\*\\*(where **V** is the highest database version agreed by the validators) regardless of the peer’s current version **P** and state **Sᴾ**. This allows peers to perform useful work more quickly (e.g., respond to balance queries or validate transactions).\n4. **Resistance to failures and malicious actors:** State sync should be resistant to failures (e.g., machine and network failures) and tolerate malicious actors in the network, including other peers. This means overcoming a wide-variety of attacks, e.g., fabricated transaction data, modified or replayed network messages, and [eclipse attacks](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin).\n5. **Tolerant of resource constraints and heterogeneity:** State sync should tolerate resource constraints (e.g., CPU, memory and storage) and embrace heterogeneity. Given the nature of decentralized networks, peers will have access to different types of hardware and optimize for different goals. State sync should account for this.\n\n## The required building blocks\n\nWe next introduce a set of fundamental building blocks required to construct a state sync protocol. For the sake of brevity, we provide a summary of each building block below and defer the technical details to future work (each of these could be a blogpost, itself!):\n\n1. **Persistent storage:** To persist data across machine crashes and failures (and enable data distribution to other peers!) we require that each peer has access to trusted persistent storage. At Aptos, we’re currently using [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) but are actively exploring other options.\n2. **Verifiable blockchain data:** To prevent malicious actors from modifying blockchain data, we require data to be authenticated and verifiable. Specifically, we need to be able to prove: (i) every transaction **T** that has been executed and committed by validators; (ii) the order of every transaction **T** executed and committed by validators; and (iii) the resulting blockchain states **Sⱽ** after committing each transaction **T**. At Aptos, we achieve this by: (i) building [merkle trees](https://aptos.dev/basics/basics-merkle-proof/) over committed transactions and the resulting blockchain states; and (ii) having validators sign the merkle roots of these trees to authenticate them.\n3. **A root of trust:** Given that Aptos supports dynamic validator sets (i.e., changes to validators at each epoch), peers need to be able to identify the current validator set from a verified history of the Aptos blockchain. We achieve this through: (i) a **genesis blob** authenticated by Aptos, which identifies the first validator set and initial blockchain state **S⁰**; and (ii) a **recent** **trusted waypoint** (e.g., a hash of the current validator set and blockchain state **Sⱽ**). Together, the genesis blob and waypoint form a root of trust allowing peers to synchronize the real Aptos blockchain and prevent attacks (e.g., [long-range attacks](https://dlt-repo.net/long-range-attack-in-proof-of-stake-pos-blockchains/)).\n\n## Achieving 1k TPS: A naive approach\n\nUsing the model and building blocks presented above, we can now illustrate a naive state sync protocol. This protocol is a simplification of the original protocol used by Aptos (i.e., `state sync v1`).\n\nThe protocol works as follows: (i) `Alice` (the syncing peer) identifies the highest local persisted blockchain version **V** and state **Sⱽ**. If none exists, `Alice` uses genesis, i.e., **S⁰**; (ii) `Alice` then randomly selects a peer, `Bob`, and requests any new sequential transactions that have been committed by the validators; (iii) if `Alice` receives a response from `Bob`, `Alice` will verify the new transactions (\\*\\*T⁰ \\*\\*to **Tᴺ**) and execute them to produce state delta’s (**D⁰ᵥ** to **Dᵀᵥ**₊ₙ); (iv) `Alice` will then apply the new state delta’s to storage along with the new transactions, updating the local state of the blockchain from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹⁺ᴺ**. `Alice` repeats this loop indefinitely. Pseudocode for the protocol looks as follows:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BNHW7j2GMZYb9pGe1lFvgw.png)\n\nState Sync v1 (Pseudocode)\n\nWe implemented this protocol at Aptos, benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), and analyzed it. Some of the key observations we made were:\n\n1. **Throughput is network latency bound**: This protocol achieves a maximum of `~1.2k TPS`. However, throughput is heavily affected by network latencies as `Alice` requests data sequentially and must wait for the peer to respond. Given that we’re seeing an average network round trip time (RTT) of `150ms` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), this is suboptimal.\n2. **CPU is dominated by execution**: When `Alice` receives a new set of transactions to synchronize, we see that `55%` of the CPU time is spent executing the transactions and `40%` is spent verifying the data, applying the state deltas to storage and persisting the new transactions. The other `5%` is attributed to message handling, serialization and other tasks.\n3. **Latency is high**: When running the network at maximum load, the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~900 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is primarily due to `Alice` randomly selecting peers when requesting data and not taking into account the network topology: peers that are closer to the validators will receive new transactions sooner.\n4. **Bootstrapping is slow**: The protocol above requires `Alice` to replay and synchronize all transactions since genesis. If `Alice` is far behind the latest state, she must wait a long period of time before being able to do anything useful (this might take hours or even days!).\n5. **Performance is easily manipulated**: The performance of this protocol is heavily influenced by malicious peers. As identified in 1 above, intentionally slow (or non-responsive) peers will force `Alice` to spend long periods of time waiting for data and not doing anything. Thus, significantly increasing synchronization time.\n6. **Resource usage is high**: This protocol is expensive for all resource types: (i) CPU usage is high because `Alice` must re-execute all transactions; (ii) storage is high because `Alice` must store all transactions and blockchain states since genesis; and (iii) network usage is high because `Alice` must receive all transactions since genesis via the network. This automatically imposes high costs and resource requirements, reducing heterogeneity.\n7. **Resources are wasted**: While `Alice` is synchronizing new data, peers in the network are also synchronizing from her. As the number of peers requesting data from `Alice` grows, there is an additional read load placed onto storage and CPU required to handle these requests. However, much of the computation that `Alice` performs to handle these requests is wasteful as peers are often requesting the same data.\n\n## Achieving 10k TPS: An optimized approach\n\nLooking at the naive protocol above, we can make a number of modifications to help address the limitations. First, we extend the protocol to support 2 additional modes of synchronization:\n\n1. **State delta syncing**: Given that validators already execute transactions and attest to the resulting blockchain states through merkle proofs, peers can rely on the state deltas produced by the validators to skip transaction execution. This avoids: (i) the high cost of execution, reducing CPU time by about `55%`; and (ii) the need for an Aptos VM, greatly simplifying a delta syncing implementation. As a result, peers can now synchronize by downloading each transaction **T** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** and applying them to storage to produce the new state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We note that this comes at the cost of increased network usage (by approx. `2.5x`).\n2. **Blockchain snapshot syncing**: Given that validators attest to each blockchain state **Sⱽ**, we can further reduce bootstrapping time by allowing peers to download the latest blockchain state directly (instead of having to produce it using transactions or state deltas). This significantly reduces bootstrapping time and is a similar approach to [snap-sync](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/) in Ethereum. The trade-off is that peers will not store any transactions or blockchain states prior to **Sⱽ**.\n\nNext, we implement a number of general optimizations and additional features to help improve performance and scalability:\n\n1. **Data prefetching**: To prevent network latencies from impacting throughput, we can perform data prefetching. Peers can prefetch transaction data (e.g., transactions and state deltas) from other peers before processing them, amortizing network latencies.\n2. **Pipelined execution and storage**: To further increase syncing throughput, we can separate transaction execution from storage persistence and use pipelining: a commonly used [optimization in processor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-and-architecture-pipelining-set-1-execution-stages-and-throughput/) design. This allows a transaction **T²** to be executed while a transaction **T¹** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** are concurrently persisted to storage.\n3. **Peer monitoring and reputation:** To improve observability and better tolerate malicious peers, we can implement a peer monitoring service to: (i) monitor peers for malicious behaviors (e.g., transferring invalid data); (ii) identify metadata about each peer, such as a summary of all transaction data the peer has and their perceived distance from the validator set; and (iii) maintain a local score for each peer. This information can then be used to optimize peer selection when requesting new blockchain data.\n4. **Data caching**: To reduce the read load on storage and prevent state sync from performing redundant computations as more and more peers synchronize, we can implement a data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory.\n5. **Storage pruning:** To prevent storage from continuously growing over time (e.g., as more transactions are committed), we can also implement dynamic pruners to remove unnecessary transaction and blockchain data from storage, e.g., anything older than a few days, weeks or months, depending on the peer configuration.\n\nWe implemented these modifications and produced a new state sync protocol (i.e., `state sync v2`). We benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) and observed:\n\n1. **Throughput increased by 5x-10x**: When executing transactions, the protocol now achieves a maximum of `~4.5k TPS`, primarily as a result of pipelining and data prefetching (i.e., the protocol is now able to fully saturate the CPU). When synchronizing state deltas the protocol achieves well over `10K TPS`, a further result of avoiding transaction execution. In both cases, throughput is no longer affected by network latency.\n2. **Latency was reduced by 3x**: While running the network at maximum load, we now see that the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~300 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is due to data prefetching and more efficient peer selection: peers who are more responsive and closer to the validators are contacted more frequently.\n3. **Bootstrapping is significantly faster**: Peers who use blockchain snapshot syncing are able to bootstrap much more quickly. Moreover, bootstrapping time is no longer affected by the length of the blockchain (i.e., the number of transactions), but rather the number of on-chain resources to synchronize. Currently in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), peers can bootstrap within minutes\\*\\*\\*.\n4. **Resource requirements are reduced**: With multiple synchronization modes and storage pruning, resource requirements have been reduced. Moreover, there is now support for heterogeneity as peers have flexibility to select the syncing strategy. For example: (i) peers with limited CPU can skip transaction execution; (ii) peers with limited storage can configure the pruner to be aggressive; and (iii) peers that wish to get up-to-date quickly can perform blockchain snapshot syncing.\n5. **Resources are more efficiently used**: When handling syncing requests from peers, we see a significantly reduced read load on storage and less wasted CPU. This is due to the new data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory. We also see that as the number of syncing peers grows in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), the data cache becomes more efficient, e.g., with `20` syncing peers we see a cache hit rate of `70%-80%` per request. But, with `60` peers we see a cache hit rate of `93%-98%`. This comes at the cost of an additional `~150 MB` of RAM to maintain the cache.\n\n## 100k TPS and beyond?\n\nWhile we’ve already improved throughput by 10x and latency by 3x, we realize that there is still more to be done. Especially if we want to match [Block-STM](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/block-stm-how-we-execute-over-160k-transactions-per-second-on-the-aptos-blockchain-3b003657e4ba) and make *Aptos a Layer 1 for everyone*!\n\nSo, how are we going to get there? Well, we’ve already started on our next state sync goal: 100k+ TPS! Although, we’re planning to save the details for a future blogpost we did want to provide some hints to the very keen reader:\n\n1. **Transaction** **batching**: Currently, Aptos treats every transaction as verifiable, i.e., the merkle proofs used to authenticate and verify data operate at the transaction granularity. This makes verification and storage incredibly expensive. One way to avoid this is to perform transaction batching, i.e., proofs over batches (or blocks!) of transactions.\n2. **网络压缩**网络庆点对的问题，Aptos。目前显示的，同时预取将在之前`~45K TPS`免于[devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/)中取回。可以出来的，以低效的网络传播量数据，将数据也传输出去`10x`。\n3. **更快的存储写入：**目前，将区块链数据保存到存储所需的时间成为状态同步吞吐量的瓶颈。我们正在积极寻找不同的优化和改进来消除这个瓶颈，包括：(i) 更高效的数据结构；(ii) 更优化的存储配置；(iii) 备用存储引擎。\n4. **并行数据处理**：到目前为止，我们要求状态同步处理数据顺序（例如，处理顺序增加版本的事务）。但是，有许多现有的方法可以让我们避免这种要求并利用并行数据处理来显着提高吞吐量，例如区块链分片！\n\n直到下一次！\n\n*如果您像我们一样热衷于设计算法、将它们付诸实践并对 Web3 的未来产生真正的影响，请联系我们——我们正在Aptos[招聘](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/)*。\n\n\\*像共识一样 :)\\*\\*我们隐含地假设状态同步必须同步**所有链上资源**的状态。部分同步策略（例如，针对特定帐户的轻客户端）超出了范围，将在未来进行讨论。\\*\\*\\*这个指标应该用一堆盐来衡量。Aptos [devnet 每两周](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/)擦除一次，因此同步的状态有限。[运行时间更长的网络（例如，我们的激励测试网](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-roadmap-209be695c77c)）需要更多的评估。", "timestamp": 1654770083, "digest": "BRyLLScm6tXT2iXpP6xrVXc2hDLLJkObemSWp8GhQjo", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}

Quite often it proceeds in the following order:\n\n1.  Look for a potentially publishable direction in the field.\n2.  Focus on publishing a result, declaring success upon deriving the result and getting acceptance, and\n3.  Lastly, look for a real-world application as an added bonus. For example, chat with engineers and try to convince them that the published result is so great that they should use it.\n\nAt Aptos Labs, we flip this script. Here:\n\n1.  We first identify hard problems that block us from achieving the performance, security and usability in the Aptos blockchain and its surrounding ecosystem.\n2.  We then focus on solving these problems, tracking our effort all along to drive significant production impact, and\n3.  Publish and celebrate the achieved results at top-tier venues.\n\nWe believe in this approach because the current landscape in the field of blockchain & Web 3.0 is full of significant problems, still open and unresolved, standing in the way of widespread adoption for billions of people across a broad set of use cases. More importantly, these problems span disciplines such as cryptography, distributed systems, programming languages, game theory, databases, networking and concurrency. To investigate and prioritize these problems, we rely on our close connection with our world-class engineering team and their intimate knowledge of the needs of the Aptos blockchain. Hence, we are in a unique and privileged position where solutions to most of the hard problems that we face are most likely going to be novel and publishable.\n\nWe understand that the research process can be [unpredictable and non-linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1U26PLiXjM). We may not solve every problem under all its constraints. Still, we search for solutions that do not fall apart when faced with the hard reality of a practical deployment. Our approach is to [“find a way, or make one”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inveniam_viam). We do not get stuck with extremes, such as stronger, unsolvable variants of the problem or oversimplified solutions that only work in convoluted academic settings.\n\n## Make publication worthy again\n\nWe aspire to advance the state of the art in blockchain technology. We welcome collaboration with others across the industry and academia who share the same goals. We dedicate significant effort to explain our results and share our knowledge via less technical and more educational mediums such as blog posts, talks and seminars.\n\nWe strive to publish results that we are proud of at the best possible venues. We never publish for the sake of publishing nor do we optimize artificial metrics.\n\nWe hold ourselves to the highest standards, requiring rigorous proofs of correctness for our protocols, and comprehensive experiments designed to leave no doubt in any of our claims. We utilize the academic review process as a tool to help us achieve this objective.\n\nIf we think our result is being unfairly judged, we start by first taking a hard look at ourselves, by asking hard questions and soliciting brutally-honest feedback from academics and other experts. We will not be blinded by appeasing the fragile ego of [reviewer #2](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1803) (e.g., *No, we will not reproduce our system and experiments on HyperLedger Fabric..*) nor ever develop an unhealthy fixation towards a particular venue or perceived academic prestige.\n\nIn other words, if the academic review process for a top-venue acceptance becomes too political or adversarial, we conclude that the overhead might not always be worth it. Instead, we let the ultimate judge of our contributions and impact be the time itself and the objectively-measurable metrics at the massive scale of the Aptos blockchain.\n\n## Make debate open again\n\nWe believe that open and direct discussions, even passionate debates at times, are the most healthy, efficient way for making progress. Crucial to this are mutual respect and mutual agreement:\n\n1.  To criticize the ideas and never the people, and\n2.  Trust that others are following (1).\n\nWe believe that by doing so, the best ideas will emerge and the best technology will make its way to the Aptos blockchain.\n\n## Make research deploy again\n\nWe consider advancing the frontier of our knowledge as a success metric for any research project. Therefore, we are not discouraged when an approach does not lead to real-world impact. However, when an approach does pull through, we take responsibility for seeing it implemented in production.\n\nIn other words, Aptos researchers lean into engineering: coding is not beneath them, but quite the opposite.\n\n[Research scientists](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/jobs/4005572005) at Aptos Labs combine foundational knowledge of the respective fields with the ability to speak the same language as the engineers, willingness to learn and grow, and follow the desire to deliver the projects to completion, possibly landing and owning the code in production.\n\n[Research engineers](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/jobs/4015672005) are instrumental to this process. Research engineers provide the creativity and the engineering pedigree to transform novel, unconventional, and research-originated approaches into the high-performance, high-quality robust system components for the real-world deployment.\n", "timestamp": 1654769921, "digest": "ejE6r05lXqp1qgogs7ZHYFAV7i4uknnRQexv4yrw9Ig", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}

[@Zoezoe888zoe](https://twitter.com/Zoezoe888zoe) [@WhoKnowsDAO](https://twitter.com/WhoKnowsDAO)\n\n本期文字稿精选了6个 Space 中的精彩提问。\n\n编辑：三斤妹妹、定慧\n\n## 什么是 Social Fi ？为什么要 Fi 化那些资产？是否是伪命题？\n\n**pengsong：**\n\nSocial fi 与 Web2 最大的不同是：\n\n能够定义你社交关系的价值，并将其资产化、金融化。\n\n并且对个人（地址）进行赋能。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n**socailfi= social+fi**，是由 defi 到 gamefi 再到 socialfi 逐步演进的。**social 所涉及的人的广泛程度是最大的。**\n\n我认为 socailfi 的本质是通过 web3 的理念改变以往社交产品中的价值分配，让 web2 里别扭的地方通过激励系统的重新调配，去高效地完成供给层和需求平台在 social 层面上的交易撮合。\n\n但我觉得 social fi 是不是伪命题还需要靠验证。\n\nsocialfi 是目前所有“xfi”中唯一没有杀手级应用的词。从17、18年的尝试至今都没有跑出来一个真正有PMF的产品，因此我认为它是一个待被定义的词，如果长时间不被定义，这个词就会慢慢死掉，换做其他。当然这个问题背后的根本还是 web3 是不是完全的fi。\n\n**林川：**\n\n**social fi 更合适的称呼应该为“web3社交平台”**，虽然目前没有一个确切的定义，但我可以讲讲它不是什么。\n\n首先 social fi 不是 web2 社交产品的简单复刻；其次也不是 social to earn。\n\nsocial to earn的 主要问题在于奖惩激励很难明确化，很难防止用户互刷，产品本身的定位也会模糊掉。\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\nSocialfi 的核心是fi，token 和 NFT 所提供的金融和资产的工具让 web3 的社交产品对于价值分配和冷启动方面有更多可用的东西，至于重构好的产品是什么样的，目前还看不清楚。\n\n一直拘泥于 x to earn 的模式里很难逃脱旁氏的魔咒。因为金融化未必能给到用户最想要的东西，用户追求的主要功能还是交友、date、沟通与链接，金钱的过分加持会让人贪婪，不管是对单纯的用户也好还是在app里以挣钱为目的的一部分人。\n\n## Web2 领域有哪些可以借鉴的地方？\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n首先需要去理清产品的定位，即“社交”指的是什么？\n\n社交本身是一个被宽泛使用的概念，实际上在产品定位的坐标轴上是有不同程度和不同定位的，按照关系链强弱和内容占比，可以分为：\n\n**1.通信通讯类**\n\n**2.交友匹配类** (dating app / social network）\n\n**3.UGC社区类产品**\n\n**4.社交媒体**\n\n四种的产品的形态、设计重点、交付给用户的核心价值不同。\n\nSocialfi 中 fi 的概念可能是指：\n\n我们如何通过 token 的模型&方式，去重新做社交中的用户激励与利益分配？\n\n利益分配不止赚钱，例如 Dating APP 的匹配。\n\n至于 socialfi 里面的去中心化比重有多少，我认为可能没有办法做到全部环节的去中心化。\n\n比如说账号的新旧数据是用户自有的，无论是自己发的 UGC 内容还是新产生的社交图谱、关系链中的数据用户都可以自由处理与转移，这是去中心化的体现。但是最后很多环节可能避免不了要中心化，比如对于传统社交媒体和社交软件来说，它的一些核心能力与价值是掌握在平台当中的。\n\n比如对于dating app 来说核心是匹配算法，用户之间的匹配很难做到去中心化，因为会导致社交效率极低下。所以社交追求的是两件事，一个是找到的用户质量足够高，另一个是匹配精准用户的效率足够高。\n\n结合上面两点来看，我认为web3如果要将 social 和 fi 结合好，**用户质量、用户获得感、用户参与感、用户对资产的拥有和处理，**这些更偏质量的东西可能是优化的重点，而一些本身特别追求用户连接效率的社交模式不太适合做区块链的改造。\n\n## 目前对Web2社交产品的批评集中在哪些方面？Web3用户期待什么样的新社交产品？\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n如果是复刻 Web2 的产品。本身没有太大意义，因为对于用户来说除了有 token 可以挣以外并没有特别的价值。\n\n**而 token 本身的金融属性提供了很好的项目初期冷启动工具**，对前期圈一波用户有很大的帮助。比如说 Open DAO 和礼物空投 group，很可惜这两个项目后面没有能让用户留下来的产品。\n\n我体验过很多复刻，但是效果都不好。\n\n我认为从产品开发的角度讲应当跳开已有概念框架的约束去思考目前web3用户群体最大的痛点是什么，再根据痛点去找合适的产品方向。至少我发现很多人体感 discord 难用，以及安全事件屡屡发生，是否可以开发出一款专门针对 web3 用户的类 discord 通讯工具去解决用户最大的痛点与需求？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前对 web2 社交产品的批评更多集中在中心化和数据资产的所有权上，在国内这个问题不是用户直接体验到的。\n\n对于 web3 产品的新需求大家集中在社群的交流和管理的需求层面，因为目前还是用 web2 的产品discord 和 telegram 来代替的，它们毕竟不是原生的 web3 产品，各自都有一些问题。因此新的 web3产品需要瞄准用户的新需求与痛点，我赞同麻辣烫老师的观点去做 discord 的替代品，是具有一定的前景的。\n\n**陈不斯：**\n\n1\\.针对麻辣烫老师提出的痛点问题，人是否真的需要单独的社交产品？\n\nNot Boring 认为NFT是一种新型社交网络，因此是否需要一个单独平台去服务和承载是一个值得探索的思考的问题。\n\n2\\.如果社交产品是成立的，同时web3的金融属性不可避免，是否可以考虑本身就有一些经济属性或者逐利属性的社交行为？参考web2产品里的社交行为去用token经济模型改造。\n\n3\\.如果web3的金融属性可以被抛弃，发展到了用户足够大、圈层足够广泛和多样的时候，是否会跟web2产品遵循同样的方法论？“为工具而来，为网络而留”\n\nweb3相比web2来说最大的优势是互通性，代表用户的安全、隐私问题，给予用户足够的自主权，但是整体上面临的最大问题还是没有找到核心痛点让用户有动力从web2社交产品迁移到web3中去。\n\n**wegger：**\n\n很多赛道都在做socialfi的产品，发现了有以下特点：\n\n1\\.有门槛，通过爱好或者资产进行过滤。人们会偏好于小众社交，对身份的认同感在小圈子里支撑起来。\n\n2\\.socialfi在隐私领域的运营场景。\n\n3\\.技术差距不大，更倾向于思维和圈子层次的小众化，往小而精的方向发展。\n\n**taosha：**\n\nMake sense的场景：用户的数据算有权。不用证明自己做了什么事情，直接在链上数据可以看到相关资质。\n\n在招聘场景里，文凭可以作为一个 soulbound token（灵魂绑定代币），并绑定在一个作为 soul 的 did 上，不管是做 web3 领英或相亲平台，都可以从 did 的 soulbound token 中读取到我对文凭获得证明。\n\n对于项目来说，web3最大的红利是拉新获客很简单。过去我们需要在抖音、百度上买广告，而现在可以去扫描谁持有 BAYC (无聊猿)，就知道他很有钱，可以给他的地址空投一个 NFT 推销产品。\n\n在链上target用户较为精准和方便，更好地服务用户。\n\n**zoey：**\n\n思考两个问题：为了什么要做？为了谁去做？\n\nweb3 的价值定义：\n\n**1.让价值回归个体**\n\n**2.增强每个个体之间的情感链接**\n\n**3.不被平台控制的个人身份**\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n## 协议 vs 应用，对两个不同方向有什么看法？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前发展形态上是产品和协议之争。\n\n如果短期出现一个比较火的 web3 的社交产品做出圈的话，需要非常强的运营能力，单纯靠协议很难。长期看web3本身的基建更适合做重协议、轻应用的形态。\n\n大家更愿意接受社交关系和身份绑定，应用只调用社交关系，而不是到哪个产品都要再跑一遍社交关系。\n\n我长期更看好协议的发展，短期能出圈的可能还是重产品、重运营的一些社交应用。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n协议需要有用户共识，而 Social 更是直接对接终端用户\n\nSocial layer 的协议，应基于杀手级应用而诞生。\n\n因为协议是制定被大家所使用的规则，杀手级应用能为规则带来共识。\n\n特别是【社交图谱】，用户必须知道这个网友我是怎么认识的，就非常看重应用场景。所以如果要做社交图谱的协议，一定要从自带场景的 APP 起步。\n\n像 super connect 这样的项目没有这么做，我不是很能理解。\n\n**林川：**\n\nsuper connect 如果要出圈，应该会是各种想做社交的应用发现调用 super connect 这个协议会很方便，能给自己加一层社交关系，从而逐渐产生跟风效应火起来。\n\n**pengsong：**\n\n如何将 social 的记录从应用的中心化存储状态放上链，NFT可能是一个很好的选择。通过钱包地址中记录着社交关系的NFT 配合协议实现社交关系上链。\n\n但目前这个领域大家围绕 social 更多是 token 的这种经济设计，NFT 的底子比较薄弱，可能还需要半年一年的时间发展。\n\n思想转变：\n\n❌ Token 经济模型\n\n❌ 中心化数据库\n\n✅ NFT 关系网络\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n站在产业格局的角度，虽然区块链是“胖协议，瘦应用”\n\n但当A16z 对 web3 概念的炒作，其实这个概念背后蕴含着将 Web3 推广给更多用户的期待。\n\n更多的应用场景带来的不仅是对整个行业发展的促进，也意味着行业上下游的竞争。例如协议下场做应用，或应用上升做协议。\n\n因此未来可能是 **“胖协议，胖应用”** 的状态。\n\nSocial 协议提供的核心价值是什么？\n\n* 如果是数据（关系链、用户身份等），则会受应用层牵制，需要等待应用的发展与积累。难以像其它协议一样通过开发者快速迭代升级\n* 如果是技术，目前社交产品的开发门槛比较低，更看重运营，协议可能无法提供足够的价值。\n\n提升价值的建议：【数据】+【技术创新】+【增值服务】\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n## 如果是杀手级应用来开发协议的话，这个应用是否可能是由 Web2 的老家伙搞出来的？\n\n或者干脆是把 Web2 产品改造而来，例如马斯克改造推特的可能？\n\n如果说，推特能被马斯克私有化，不再服务于股东利益，通过把底层协议和用户关系贡献出来，将自己的平台价值颠覆掉，转型成一个社交公链，想象空间就太大了。\n\n而且对于web2巨头自我革命，恐怕只有马斯克有机会做到了\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\n反对，推特这样的巨鳄自我革命太难。\n\n更可能的路径是这样的：\n\n目前围绕各个公链，已经基于交易，形成了经济关系网络，而社区中空。\n\n（例如以太坊网络中60-70%的地址都在 Defi 热潮中参与了进来。但没有产品去承载这种社交关系）\n\n因此，围绕公链做社区才是方向。因为只要公链不死，关系网络就在。\n\n这是我看好的 Social fi 机会。\n\n**Eric：**\n\n看好 Web2 巨头带着自身存量转入 Web3\n\n因为网络效应太重，哪怕开发者达成共识追求理想，但难以与用户达成共识。\n\n可能只有用户的无感知迁移才行得通。\n\n**BillyWen：**\n\n曾经电报、电话时代，协议都是通的。例如你可以随时给美国朋友打电话。\n\nIM 即时通讯时代来临后，才出现应用层建墙圈用户，为了自身获利。\n\n目前 Web3 实现了货币和金融的无边界，相信未来的 web3 Social 一样没有边界。\n\n商业公司改革的确很困难，因为要追求利润。\n\n但未来10年如果有人站出来，做出了打破边界的 Social 变革，我相信他会被载入史册。\n\n**Beagle Dao：**\nWeb3 Social 有四个方面\n\n1. **基础设施、协议**\n   1. 例如 ENS 解决了钱包和名字的问题，通过 ENS 的身份社交，而非钱包地址。\n2. **社交凭证**\n   1. 例如 POAP，通过 NFT 证明你在哪里做过什么事\n3. **社交关系、社交图谱**\n4. **工具**\n   1. 【语音】例如：Clubhouse 、Twitter space\n   2. 【信息】例如：微信、邮件\n   3. 【内容】例如：推特、FB\n\n语音比较难做。\n\n信息类工具很多人在做，迁移成本高，平台不互动。\n\n可能需要大佬入场，强制或用更高的势能带动更多人加入\n\n因为 Web3 的社交关系都存在链上，所以不会像 Web2 那样重平台。\n\n更可能是共创式，每个人都做一点，拼成整个 Web3 社交的生态。\n\n观点：**Web3 社交会从B端生长出来。**\n\n对于C端而言，Web2 已经有足够好的产品了。\n\n更大的可能性是开发B端有普遍需求的工具&协议，因为B端自己懒的做而被广泛调用，因而普及。\n\n## Web2 是邪恶的吗？\n\n**Eric：**\n\n我并不认为web2 邪恶，至少有游戏规则\n\nweb2 榨取用户价值、用户体验受损的的矛盾会持续存在，但也与现在的资本市场玩法息息相关。例如开放平台都会缩回去，因为平台感觉自己把有价值的东西送出去，但却无法满足金主爸爸的期待。\n\n这种恶是人性的恶。只要 Web3 是人做的，我想一样会面对。\n\n**web3 的核心是改变价值体系，基于token 经济让系统中的各个角色都开心。**\n\n但从金融层面，怎么玩都是零和游戏。打破很难。\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n区块链不能解决人性的问题，从终局来看我会悲观，未来可能会出来新的不正义和垄断。\n\n而此刻他正在追求更公平，找到新的解决方案，这是我欣赏的。\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\nWeb3 的社交可能会更邪恶。\n\n当一个人的身份可以被 NFT 等链上方式充分定义，很多社交圈层将很容易通过技术建立门槛。你可能无法再通过找关系就加入一个大佬们会讨论问题的微信群、获得资源。可能因为你没进圈子，连吃瓜的资格都没有。\n\n但相应的，web2 当中很难走上颠覆（头部效应），在web3当中，你的努力更容易实现成功。\n\n**Red_Phoenix:**\n\n任何一个行业都有其宿命，都有其黑暗和光明。\n\n例如 Web2 的公司就一定会走向垄断和盈利，**而 Social 在 Web3 中的使命，可能是构建一个国家**，有自己共识、金融和分配方式。特别是当区块链的信用、生产力与线下产生链接时，就非常有想象力。\n\n——————————————\n\nWhoKnows DAO 将持续为大家组织优质的 Space、专题研究活动。\n\n如果你希望基于 Social fi

{"id": "XUFG5BsPqU__4B2GuDq_sQzXRav79QT7k4wvtQ-KrL4", "title": "The Evolution of State Sync: The path to 100k+ transactions per second with sub-second latency at Aptos", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*pq1hY3A_P-ao8UB26hcLSw.png)\n\n**By **[**Joshua Lind**](https://www.joshdavidlind.com/)\n\n**TL;DR: The Aptos blockchain leverages a wide range of novel techniques to ensure high-throughput, low latency, verified state synchronization in a decentralized network. Peers can validate and synchronize over 10k transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second latency in Aptos today, and we’re already on our way to 100k+ TPS.**\n\n## Overview\n\nState synchronization (or state sync) is an important but often overlooked aspect of blockchain design. In this blogpost, we discuss the evolution of state sync at Aptos and present several key insights behind the design of the latest state sync protocol. We further explore how we recently increased state sync throughput by 10x, reduced latency by 3x, and are continuing to pave the way for faster, more efficient blockchain synchronization.\n\n## What is state sync?\n\nMost blockchains today are structured hierarchically, with a set of active validators at the heart of the network. The validators grow the blockchain by executing transactions, producing blocks and achieving consensus. The rest of the peers in the network (e.g., fullnodes and clients) replicate the blockchain data produced by the validators (e.g., blocks and transactions). State sync is the protocol that allows non-validator peers to distribute, verify and persist this blockchain data and ensures that all peers in the ecosystem are synchronized. See the diagram below for what this looks like at Aptos.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XesMBhS5rLVIiluTme0nlw.png)\n\nAptos Ecosystem (Overview)\n\n## Why does state sync matter?\n\nState sync is rarely mentioned when evaluating blockchains: it is often a footnote in a whitepaper dedicated to more interesting topics\\*. However, state sync has significant consequences on blockchain performance, security, and user experience. Consider the following:\n\n1.  **Time to finality and user experience:** When new transactions are executed by validators, state sync is responsible for propagating the data to peers and clients. If state sync is slow or unreliable, peers will perceive long transaction processing delays, artificially inflating the time to finality. This has a huge impact on user experience, e.g., decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and payment processing will all be much slower.\n2.  **Relationship with consensus:** Validators that crash or fall behind the rest of the validator set rely on state sync to bring them back up to speed (i.e., synchronize the latest blockchain state). If state sync cannot process transactions as quickly as they are executed by consensus, crashed validators will never be able to recover. Moreover, new validators will never be able to start participating in consensus (as they won’t ever catch up!) and fullnodes will never be able to sync to the latest state (they’ll continue to fall further behind!).\n3.  **Implications on decentralization**: Having a quick, efficient and scalable state sync protocol allows for: (i) faster rotations of an active validator set, as validators can move in and out of consensus more freely; (ii) more potential validators to choose from in the network; (iii) more fullnodes to come online quickly and without having to wait long periods of time; and (iv) lower resource requirements, increasing heterogeneity. All of these factors increase decentralization in the network and help to scale the blockchain in size and geography.\n4.  **Data correctness**: State sync is responsible for verifying the correctness of all blockchain data during synchronization. This prevents malicious peers and adversaries in the network from modifying, censoring or fabricating transaction data and presenting it as valid. If state sync fails to do this (or does it incorrectly), fullnodes and clients could be tricked into accepting invalid data and this would have devastating consequences on the network.\n\n## Reasoning about state sync\n\nTo better reason about state sync, we first introduce a generic model for blockchain execution. While this model targets the Aptos blockchain specifically, it can be generalized to others.\n\nWe model the Aptos blockchain as a simple versioned database, where at each version **V** there is a unique blockchain state **Sⱽ** containing all on-chain accounts and resources. A transaction **T** can be executed by the Aptos virtual machine (VM) on state **Sⱽ** to produce a state delta **Dᵀᵥ **representing all state modifications that would occur on **Sⱽ **should **T **be committed. When **Dᵀᵥ** is applied to **Sⱽ** (that is, we consider **T** committed), it results in a new version **V+1** and a new blockchain state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We refer to the very first blockchain state as the genesis state **S⁰**. The diagrams below show transaction execution and state delta application.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZwNwY2c1kg8mYrQ-pmHziA.png)\n\nTransaction Execution and State Delta Application (Model)\n\n## What are the goals?\n\nWith a generic model in place, we can now define several fundamental goals for state sync\\*\\*:\n\n1.  **High-throughput**: State sync should maximize the amount of transactions that can be synchronized by each peer per second. That is, maximize the rate of state transitions from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹** for each **T **committed by the validators. If throughput is low it increases syncing time and becomes a bottleneck for the network.\n2.  **Low latency**: State sync should minimize the time it takes up-to-date peers to synchronize new transactions committed by validators. That is, minimize the time it takes peers at **Sⱽ** to sync to **Sⱽ⁺¹**, for each **T** that is newly committed by the validators. This affects the overall time to finality perceived by clients.\n3.  **Fast bootstrapping time**: State sync should minimize the time it takes new (or crashed) peers to sync to the latest state of the blockchain. That is, minimize the time it takes to sync to **Sⱽ **(where **V** is the highest database version agreed by the validators) regardless of the peer’s current version **P** and state **Sᴾ**. This allows peers to perform useful work more quickly (e.g., respond to balance queries or validate transactions).\n4.  **Resistance to failures and malicious actors:** State sync should be resistant to failures (e.g., machine and network failures) and tolerate malicious actors in the network, including other peers. This means overcoming a wide-variety of attacks, e.g., fabricated transaction data, modified or replayed network messages, and [eclipse attacks](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin).\n5.  **Tolerant of resource constraints and heterogeneity:** State sync should tolerate resource constraints (e.g., CPU, memory and storage) and embrace heterogeneity. Given the nature of decentralized networks, peers will have access to different types of hardware and optimize for different goals. State sync should account for this.\n\n## The required building blocks\n\nWe next introduce a set of fundamental building blocks required to construct a state sync protocol. For the sake of brevity, we provide a summary of each building block below and defer the technical details to future work (each of these could be a blogpost, itself!):\n\n1.  **Persistent storage:** To persist data across machine crashes and failures (and enable data distribution to other peers!) we require that each peer has access to trusted persistent storage. At Aptos, we’re currently using [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) but are actively exploring other options.\n2.  **Verifiable blockchain data:** To prevent malicious actors from modifying blockchain data, we require data to be authenticated and verifiable. Specifically, we need to be able to prove: (i) every transaction **T** that has been executed and committed by validators; (ii) the order of every transaction **T** executed and committed by validators; and (iii) the resulting blockchain states **Sⱽ** after committing each transaction **T**. At Aptos, we achieve this by: (i) building [merkle trees](https://aptos.dev/basics/basics-merkle-proof/) over committed transactions and the resulting blockchain states; and (ii) having validators sign the merkle roots of these trees to authenticate them.\n3.  **A root of trust:** Given that Aptos supports dynamic validator sets (i.e., changes to validators at each epoch), peers need to be able to identify the current validator set from a verified history of the Aptos blockchain. We achieve this through: (i) a **genesis blob** authenticated by Aptos, which identifies the first validator set and initial blockchain state **S⁰**; and (ii) a **recent** **trusted waypoint** (e.g., a hash of the current validator set and blockchain state **Sⱽ**). Together, the genesis blob and waypoint form a root of trust allowing peers to synchronize the real Aptos blockchain and prevent attacks (e.g., [long-range attacks](https://dlt-repo.net/long-range-attack-in-proof-of-stake-pos-blockchains/)).\n\n## Achieving 1k TPS: A naive approach\n\nUsing the model and building blocks presented above, we can now illustrate a naive state sync protocol. This protocol is a simplification of the original protocol used by Aptos (i.e., `state sync v1`).\n\nThe protocol works as follows: (i) `Alice` (the syncing peer) identifies the highest local persisted blockchain version **V** and state **Sⱽ**. If none exists, `Alice` uses genesis, i.e., **S⁰**; (ii) `Alice` then randomly selects a peer, `Bob`, and requests any new sequential transactions that have been committed by the validators; (iii) if `Alice` receives a response from `Bob`, `Alice` will verify the new transactions (**T⁰ **to **Tᴺ**) and execute them to produce state delta’s (**D⁰ᵥ** to **Dᵀᵥ**₊ₙ); (iv) `Alice` will then apply the new state delta’s to storage along with the new transactions, updating the local state of the blockchain from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹⁺ᴺ**. `Alice` repeats this loop indefinitely. Pseudocode for the protocol looks as follows:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BNHW7j2GMZYb9pGe1lFvgw.png)\n\nState Sync v1 (Pseudocode)\n\nWe implemented this protocol at Aptos, benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), and analyzed it. Some of the key observations we made were:\n\n1.  **Throughput is network latency bound**: This protocol achieves a maximum of `~1.2k TPS`. However, throughput is heavily affected by network latencies as `Alice` requests data sequentially and must wait for the peer to respond. Given that we’re seeing an average network round trip time (RTT) of `150ms` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), this is suboptimal.\n2.  **CPU is dominated by execution**: When `Alice` receives a new set of transactions to synchronize, we see that `55%` of the CPU time is spent executing the transactions and `40%` is spent verifying the data, applying the state deltas to storage and persisting the new transactions. The other `5%` is attributed to message handling, serialization and other tasks.\n3.  **Latency is high**: When running the network at maximum load, the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~900 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is primarily due to `Alice` randomly selecting peers when requesting data and not taking into account the network topology: peers that are closer to the validators will receive new transactions sooner.\n4.  **Bootstrapping is slow**: The protocol above requires `Alice` to replay and synchronize all transactions since genesis. If `Alice` is far behind the latest state, she must wait a long period of time before being able to do anything useful (this might take hours or even days!).\n5.  **Performance is easily manipulated**: The performance of this protocol is heavily influenced by malicious peers. As identified in 1 above, intentionally slow (or non-responsive) peers will force `Alice` to spend long periods of time waiting for data and not doing anything. Thus, significantly increasing synchronization time.\n6.  **Resource usage is high**: This protocol is expensive for all resource types: (i) CPU usage is high because `Alice` must re-execute all transactions; (ii) storage is high because `Alice` must store all transactions and blockchain states since genesis; and (iii) network usage is high because `Alice` must receive all transactions since genesis via the network. This automatically imposes high costs and resource requirements, reducing heterogeneity.\n7.  **Resources are wasted**: While `Alice` is synchronizing new data, peers in the network are also synchronizing from her. As the number of peers requesting data from `Alice` grows, there is an additional read load placed onto storage and CPU required to handle these requests. However, much of the computation that `Alice` performs to handle these requests is wasteful as peers are often requesting the same data.\n\n## Achieving 10k TPS: An optimized approach\n\nLooking at the naive protocol above, we can make a number of modifications to help address the limitations. First, we extend the protocol to support 2 additional modes of synchronization:\n\n1.  **State delta syncing**: Given that validators already execute transactions and attest to the resulting blockchain states through merkle proofs, peers can rely on the state deltas produced by the validators to skip transaction execution. This avoids: (i) the high cost of execution, reducing CPU time by about `55%`; and (ii) the need for an Aptos VM, greatly simplifying a delta syncing implementation. As a result, peers can now synchronize by downloading each transaction **T** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** and applying them to storage to produce the new state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We note that this comes at the cost of increased network usage (by approx. `2.5x`).\n2.  **Blockchain snapshot syncing**: Given that validators attest to each blockchain state **Sⱽ**, we can further reduce bootstrapping time by allowing peers to download the latest blockchain state directly (instead of having to produce it using transactions or state deltas). This significantly reduces bootstrapping time and is a similar approach to [snap-sync](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/) in Ethereum. The trade-off is that peers will not store any transactions or blockchain states prior to **Sⱽ**.\n\nNext, we implement a number of general optimizations and additional features to help improve performance and scalability:\n\n1.  **Data prefetching**: To prevent network latencies from impacting throughput, we can perform data prefetching. Peers can prefetch transaction data (e.g., transactions and state deltas) from other peers before processing them, amortizing network latencies.\n2.  **Pipelined execution and storage**: To further increase syncing throughput, we can separate transaction execution from storage persistence and use pipelining: a commonly used [optimization in processor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-and-architecture-pipelining-set-1-execution-stages-and-throughput/) design. This allows a transaction **T²** to be executed while a transaction **T¹** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** are concurrently persisted to storage.\n3.  **Peer monitoring and reputation:** To improve observability and better tolerate malicious peers, we can implement a peer monitoring service to: (i) monitor peers for malicious behaviors (e.g., transferring invalid data); (ii) identify metadata about each peer, such as a summary of all transaction data the peer has and their perceived distance from the validator set; and (iii) maintain a local score for each peer. This information can then be used to optimize peer selection when requesting new blockchain data.\n4.  **Data caching**: To reduce the read load on storage and prevent state sync from performing redundant computations as more and more peers synchronize, we can implement a data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory.\n5.  **Storage pruning:** To prevent storage from continuously growing over time (e.g., as more transactions are committed), we can also implement dynamic pruners to remove unnecessary transaction and blockchain data from storage, e.g., anything older than a few days, weeks or months, depending on the peer configuration.\n\nWe implemented these modifications and produced a new state sync protocol (i.e., `state sync v2`). We benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) and observed:\n\n1.  **Throughput increased by 5x-10x**: When executing transactions, the protocol now achieves a maximum of `~4.5k TPS`, primarily as a result of pipelining and data prefetching (i.e., the protocol is now able to fully saturate the CPU). When synchronizing state deltas the protocol achieves well over `10K TPS`, a further result of avoiding transaction execution. In both cases, throughput is no longer affected by network latency.\n2.  **Latency was reduced by 3x**: While running the network at maximum load, we now see that the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~300 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is due to data prefetching and more efficient peer selection: peers who are more responsive and closer to the validators are contacted more frequently.\n3.  **Bootstrapping is significantly faster**: Peers who use blockchain snapshot syncing are able to bootstrap much more quickly. Moreover, bootstrapping time is no longer affected by the length of the blockchain (i.e., the number of transactions), but rather the number of on-chain resources to synchronize. Currently in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), peers can bootstrap within minutes\\*\\*\\*.\n4.  **Resource requirements are reduced**: With multiple synchronization modes and storage pruning, resource requirements have been reduced. Moreover, there is now support for heterogeneity as peers have flexibility to select the syncing strategy. For example: (i) peers with limited CPU can skip transaction execution; (ii) peers with limited storage can configure the pruner to be aggressive; and (iii) peers that wish to get up-to-date quickly can perform blockchain snapshot syncing.\n5.  **Resources are more efficiently used**: When handling syncing requests from peers, we see a significantly reduced read load on storage and less wasted CPU. This is due to the new data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory. We also see that as the number of syncing peers grows in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), the data cache becomes more efficient, e.g., with `20` syncing peers we see a cache hit rate of `70%-80%` per request. But, with `60` peers we see a cache hit rate of `93%-98%`. This comes at the cost of an additional `~150 MB` of RAM to maintain the cache.\n\n## 100k TPS and beyond?\n\nWhile we’ve already improved throughput by 10x and latency by 3x, we realize that there is still more to be done. Especially if we want to match [Block-STM](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/block-stm-how-we-execute-over-160k-transactions-per-second-on-the-aptos-blockchain-3b003657e4ba) and make *Aptos a Layer 1 for everyone*!\n\nSo, how are we going to get there? Well, we’ve already started on our next state sync goal: 100k+ TPS! Although, we’re planning to save the details for a future blogpost we did want to provide some hints to the very keen reader:\n\n1.  **Transaction** **batching**: Currently, Aptos treats every transaction as verifiable, i.e., the merkle proofs used to authenticate and verify data operate at the transaction granularity. This makes verification and storage incredibly expensive. One way to avoid this is to perform transaction batching, i.e., proofs over batches (or blocks!) of transactions.\n2.  **Network compression**: Network bandwidth often becomes a bottleneck in peer-to-peer networks and Aptos is no exception. Currently, the state sync prefetcher can fetch around `~45K TPS` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) before saturating bandwidth. This is an issue if we want to scale. Thankfully, we’ve already recognized that peers are distributing data using an inefficient serialization format and by using off the shelf compression we can reduce the amount of transmitted data by more than `10x`.\n3.  **Faster storage writes:** Currently, state sync throughput is bottlenecked by the time it takes to persist blockchain data to storage. We’re actively looking at different optimizations and improvements that we can make to remove this bottleneck, including: (i) more efficient data structures; (ii) more optimal storage configurations; and (iii) alternate storage engines.\n4.  **Parallel data processing**: Until now, we’ve required that state sync process data sequentially (e.g., handle transactions at sequentially increasing versions). However, there are a number of existing approaches that would allow us to avoid this requirement and exploit parallel data processing to significantly increase throughput, e.g., blockchain sharding!\n\nUntil next time!\n\n*If you are, like us, passionate about designing algorithms, putting them in practice, and making a real impact on the future of Web3, please reach out — we are *[*hiring*](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/)* at Aptos.*\n\n\\*Like consensus :)\\\n\\*\\*We implicitly assume that state sync must synchronize the states of **all on-chain resources**. Partial syncing strategies (e.g., light-clients that target specific accounts) are out of scope and will be discussed in the future.\\\n\\*\\*\\*This metric should be taken with a heap of salt. The Aptos [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) is wiped bi-weekly, so there is limited state to synchronize. More evaluation will be required on longer running networks (e.g., our incentivized [testnets](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-roadmap-209be695c77c)).\n", "timestamp": 1654770163, "digest": "YYj5glsQpEn8CC5FmmnrxK_OG1QFHoQNcRs6YQSQTeY", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}

During this journey, we look forward to the Aptos community coming together to build a secure, reliable, and decentralized network. Below we describe our timeline along this path, outlining both deliverables and goals. The exact goals and rewards will be published as the registration for the incentivized testnet opens. While this document aims to be exhaustive in the work remaining, we intend to maintain flexibility in the timeline due to new opportunities and challenges that are found along the way.\n\nThe primary goal for our incentivized testnets is simple: ensure that this community is ready to launch a production-grade Aptos mainnet. Node operators, developers, auditors, and ecosystem builders alike are all invited to participate and will be rewarded for their contributions toward this goal. Our community will engage in a number of evaluations and drills that validate the outcomes of core developer testing and also prepare us all for mainnet operation. We invite and welcome all feedback across the Aptos community during this exciting time and will host frequent community sessions to listen, iterate, and improve on these plans.\n\n## Overview\n\n**IT1 (Incentivized Testnet 1): Decentralized Startup**\n\n*   Registration May 13\n*   Begins May 16\n*   Completes May 27\n*   Major Deliverables\\\n    1\\.

Our community of intrepid Aptonauts will coordinate missions to explore the Aptoverse. This way, everyone has opportunities to get involved and earn rewards from quality participation. We are openly discussing a few incentivized projects:\n\n1.  Aptoversity (education)\n2.  Bounties + Hackathons (development)\n3.  Creative Challenge (growth)\n\nWe will share more info about how to participate in this Aptos community program soon. Jump in [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aptoslabs) to discuss, and keep an eye out for the new Aptos community forum.\n\n## FAQ\n\nWhat behaviors will be rewarded?\n\n*   For every deliverable and goal, Aptos Labs with support from the Aptos community will determine the proper success criteria and incentives to understand our progress in the area. Some evaluations may have to be repeated, possibly with improved success criteria and with different incentives. We will provide a clear determination of both the success criteria and incentives prior to starting every evaluation with the community.\n\nWhat will the registration process look like?\n\n*   We are still working through the requirements to join incentivized testnet and what the registration process will include.\n\nWhen will there be more updates?\n\n*   We will share more details as we get closer to the launch of incentivized testnet. Many of these areas of ambiguity are noted in our roadmap outlined below.\n\nWhen will you publish your tokenomics and white paper?\n\n*   We are actively evaluating different approaches to tokenomics and anticipate some form being published while we are running the incentivized testnets. Similarly, our white paper will encompass the work we believe will be ready by Mainnet, which will also be forthcoming.\n\nCould you elaborate on the validator participation size?\n\n*   During IT1, we’ll start with 100 participants. We set this number cautiously as this is the first time the software stack will be run in the wild. Internally, we have evaluated much larger networks. We anticipate increasing the number of participants in each ensuing round as the community establishes an understanding of deploying and managing an Aptos node. By IT4, we anticipate allowing as many validators as possible.\n\n## Technical Roadmap\n\nBetween now and through the end of the incentivized testnets, we will be upgrading the Aptos blockchain with many technical contributions.

{"id": "coxVUobbXvVWVw35bZMRiCbjO04I4J9TJ2g0x8C0JSQ", "title": "Proposal: develop usecases for more engagement with the community", "body": "Dear Community,\n\nSince summer 2021 I’ve been in love with the NFT space and all its developments during this time. During that time I also joined the KOIOS Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies minor (30 ECTS) and developed a proof of concept during my field assignment. KOIOS was very interested in bringing me on board so I joined their tech-team quickly after.\n\nNFTs are in my opinion and after doing some research a great way to start and keep a community engaged with the project. So in this post I’ll share my idea to bring the KOIOS platform to a new level with the involvement of NFTs.\n\n## 1. Backstory & Thesis\n\nSince early may I have been doing my thesis at KOIOS, with so far great success. I’ve received positive outlooks from my thesis examiner and mentors.\n\n### 1.1 Thesis subject\n\nMy thesis involves bringing usecases to the KOIOS platform that make use blockchain technology and the primary goal of the thesis and KOIOS is to grow more interest and involvement from the community.\n\nAs KOIOS states:\n\n> “KOIOS aims to become a worldwide **community** with a platform where talent can learn, earn and return. The focus is on the **community**.\"\n\n### 1.2 Thesis progress\n\nDuring my thesis I’ve been researching NFTs and their usecases, especially some successful NFT communities. I also analyzed their on-chain statistics using [Nansen](https://www.nansen.ai/).\n\nProjects I’ve researched:\n\n* Bored Ape Yacht Club\n* CloneX - X Takashi Murakami\n* Proof Collective / Moonbirds\n* Nanopass / Phantom Network\n\nI’ve found some interesting similarities and innovations to attain and engage a community.\n\n**“Utility is king”**\n\nUtility is a very imporant factor for an NFT to have, because people want to be able to use the NFT. Art only is not enough for a community centric NFT.  Forms of utility that successfully worked are:\n\n* IP Ownership\n* Exclusive access\n* **Gamification**\n\nSo to conclude an NFT needs utility to attain interest from the community.\n\n## 2. The proposal\n\nFor my thesis I need to gather as many input from the community, because we are not a closed group of people anymore. Your input matters here. Feel free to DM me on discord if you have any additions or ideas:\n\nPauwCrypto#9387\n\n### 2.1 The idea\n\nThe general idea is to develop an extension to the KOIOS platform that would allow new students that are going to follow the minor to claim a blank NFT in the beginning of their journey (this can later be expanded to also old students) to becoming a Titan. This blank NFT is a dynamic NFT, meaning during your journey you can **evolve** its look. How cool would that be?! See it as a sort of achievement system but in the form of NFTs.\n\n### 2.2 An example\n\nJohn Doe is a student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences and chooses to follow the 30 ECTS minor in Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies. He has 0 knowledge of blockchains.\n\nDuring the onboarding of the new students they are required to create a MetaMask wallet and register their public key with the tutors (this has been done every minor if I remember correctly).\n\nAfter wallets are submitted to the platform John is able to go to the website, connect his wallet and press a claim NFT button. This will give John a blank NFT, image can be seen below. **DON’T WORRY THIS IS NOT THE FINAL ART, JUST A QUICK SIMPLE DRAFT 😅**\n\n![EXAMPLE: This is an example of a blank NFT.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-XGmdHyvlIlFqHQA5Mpmt.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nJohn is happy with his first NFT, but wants to make it prettier. With successfully passing Level 1 of the blockchain minor john is able to claim another NFT, which is a sort of skin for his NFT (passing level 1 gives you the ability to claim a bronze skin). Using the web interface John is able to request an upgrade for his NFT. The system checks if John has the skin and updates the image for Johns’ blank NFT.\n\n![EXAMPLE: This is an example of an upgraded NFT.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n9ln-HGoUnEMjb7_1yxru.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThis was one example of an upgradable NFT, but much more could be added. For example we could have separate NFTs that can only be attained by contributing to the community or the platform, not just for passing the minor. We could attach certain statistics in terms of ‘NFT Power‘ to each trait, so the further you evolve your NFT the higher on a future leaderboard you sit.\n\nWhat I’ve explained above could be seen as gamification of the minor/platform to gain more enagement and could also lead to more contributions for the KOIOS community. This will not only help and grow the community but also teaches new students how certain things work when interacting with smart contracts and wallets through a web UI. \n\n## 3. Raw information\n\nThis section will go over some raw information regarding building this out.\n\n### 3.1 Technical details NFT\n\n* Will use ERC-721 for the blank NFT (Your blank NFT that you start with is soulbound and unique to you)\n* Will use ERC-1155 for the upgrades (for example 100 students could own the passed minor certificate NFT)\n* NFTs will be non-transferable (its an achievement for you the student only)\n\n### 3.2 Costs\n\nAn important factor of a DAO is determining costs for developement, but not only the developer also the community.\n\n* The launch of the NFTs will be on Polygon, this is an alternative evm compatible side-chain and transactions only costs cents.\n* There will be a faucet which generous community members can donate to or could be filled with some DAO funds. This allows first time blockchain users to claim their first $MATIC for transactional purposes.\n* Regarding developement costs, I’ll do this totally for free 😎, since it is for my thesis assignement (I’m studying Software Engineering).\n* I do however want to propose a reward for developing the concept.

Quite often it proceeds in the following order:\n\n1.  Look for a potentially publishable direction in the field.\n2.  Focus on publishing a result, declaring success upon deriving the result and getting acceptance, and\n3.  Lastly, look for a real-world application as an added bonus. For example, chat with engineers and try to convince them that the published result is so great that they should use it.\n\nAt Aptos Labs, we flip this script. Here:\n\n1.  We first identify hard problems that block us from achieving the performance, security and usability in the Aptos blockchain and its surrounding ecosystem.\n2.  We then focus on solving these problems, tracking our effort all along to drive significant production impact, and\n3.  Publish and celebrate the achieved results at top-tier venues.\n\nWe believe in this approach because the current landscape in the field of blockchain & Web 3.0 is full of significant problems, still open and unresolved, standing in the way of widespread adoption for billions of people across a broad set of use cases. More importantly, these problems span disciplines such as cryptography, distributed systems, programming languages, game theory, databases, networking and concurrency. To investigate and prioritize these problems, we rely on our close connection with our world-class engineering team and their intimate knowledge of the needs of the Aptos blockchain. Hence, we are in a unique and privileged position where solutions to most of the hard problems that we face are most likely going to be novel and publishable.\n\nWe understand that the research process can be [unpredictable and non-linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1U26PLiXjM). We may not solve every problem under all its constraints. Still, we search for solutions that do not fall apart when faced with the hard reality of a practical deployment. Our approach is to [“find a way, or make one”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inveniam_viam). We do not get stuck with extremes, such as stronger, unsolvable variants of the problem or oversimplified solutions that only work in convoluted academic settings.\n\n## Make publication worthy again\n\nWe aspire to advance the state of the art in blockchain technology. We welcome collaboration with others across the industry and academia who share the same goals. We dedicate significant effort to explain our results and share our knowledge via less technical and more educational mediums such as blog posts, talks and seminars.\n\nWe strive to publish results that we are proud of at the best possible venues. We never publish for the sake of publishing nor do we optimize artificial metrics.\n\nWe hold ourselves to the highest standards, requiring rigorous proofs of correctness for our protocols, and comprehensive experiments designed to leave no doubt in any of our claims. We utilize the academic review process as a tool to help us achieve this objective.\n\nIf we think our result is being unfairly judged, we start by first taking a hard look at ourselves, by asking hard questions and soliciting brutally-honest feedback from academics and other experts. We will not be blinded by appeasing the fragile ego of [reviewer #2](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1803) (e.g., *No, we will not reproduce our system and experiments on HyperLedger Fabric..*) nor ever develop an unhealthy fixation towards a particular venue or perceived academic prestige.\n\nIn other words, if the academic review process for a top-venue acceptance becomes too political or adversarial, we conclude that the overhead might not always be worth it. Instead, we let the ultimate judge of our contributions and impact be the time itself and the objectively-measurable metrics at the massive scale of the Aptos blockchain.\n\n## Make debate open again\n\nWe believe that open and direct discussions, even passionate debates at times, are the most healthy, efficient way for making progress. Crucial to this are mutual respect and mutual agreement:\n\n1.  To criticize the ideas and never the people, and\n2.  Trust that others are following (1).\n\nWe believe that by doing so, the best ideas will emerge and the best technology will make its way to the Aptos blockchain.\n\n## Make research deploy again\n\nWe consider advancing the frontier of our knowledge as a success metric for any research project. Therefore, we are not discouraged when an approach does not lead to real-world impact. However, when an approach does pull through, we take responsibility for seeing it implemented in production.\n\nIn other words, Aptos researchers lean into engineering: coding is not beneath them, but quite the opposite.\n\n[Research scientists](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/jobs/4005572005) at Aptos Labs combine foundational knowledge of the respective fields with the ability to speak the same language as the engineers, willingness to learn and grow, and follow the desire to deliver the projects to completion, possibly landing and owning the code in production.\n\n[Research engineers](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/jobs/4015672005) are instrumental to this process.

[@Zoezoe888zoe](https://twitter.com/Zoezoe888zoe) [@WhoKnowsDAO](https://twitter.com/WhoKnowsDAO)\n\n本期文字稿精选了6个 Space 中的精彩提问。\n\n编辑：三斤妹妹、定慧\n\n## 什么是 Social Fi ？为什么要 Fi 化那些资产？是否是伪命题？\n\n**pengsong：**\n\nSocial fi 与 Web2 最大的不同是：\n\n能够定义你社交关系的价值，并将其资产化、金融化。\n\n并且对个人（地址）进行赋能。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n**socailfi= social+fi**，是由 defi 到 gamefi 再到 socialfi 逐步演进的。**social 所涉及的人的广泛程度是最大的。**\n\n我认为 socailfi 的本质是通过 web3 的理念改变以往社交产品中的价值分配，让 web2 里别扭的地方通过激励系统的重新调配，去高效地完成供给层和需求平台在 social 层面上的交易撮合。\n\n但我觉得 social fi 是不是伪命题还需要靠验证。\n\nsocialfi 是目前所有“xfi”中唯一没有杀手级应用的词。从17、18年的尝试至今都没有跑出来一个真正有PMF的产品，因此我认为它是一个待被定义的词，如果长时间不被定义，这个词就会慢慢死掉，换做其他。当然这个问题背后的根本还是 web3 是不是完全的fi。\n\n**林川：**\n\n**social fi 更合适的称呼应该为“web3社交平台”**，虽然目前没有一个确切的定义，但我可以讲讲它不是什么。\n\n首先 social fi 不是 web2 社交产品的简单复刻；其次也不是 social to earn。\n\nsocial to earn的 主要问题在于奖惩激励很难明确化，很难防止用户互刷，产品本身的定位也会模糊掉。\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\nSocialfi 的核心是fi，token 和 NFT 所提供的金融和资产的工具让 web3 的社交产品对于价值分配和冷启动方面有更多可用的东西，至于重构好的产品是什么样的，目前还看不清楚。\n\n一直拘泥于 x to earn 的模式里很难逃脱旁氏的魔咒。因为金融化未必能给到用户最想要的东西，用户追求的主要功能还是交友、date、沟通与链接，金钱的过分加持会让人贪婪，不管是对单纯的用户也好还是在app里以挣钱为目的的一部分人。\n\n## Web2 领域有哪些可以借鉴的地方？\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n首先需要去理清产品的定位，即“社交”指的是什么？\n\n社交本身是一个被宽泛使用的概念，实际上在产品定位的坐标轴上是有不同程度和不同定位的，按照关系链强弱和内容占比，可以分为：\n\n**1.通信通讯类**\n\n**2.交友匹配类** (dating app / social network）\n\n**3.UGC社区类产品**\n\n**4.社交媒体**\n\n四种的产品的形态、设计重点、交付给用户的核心价值不同。\n\nSocialfi 中 fi 的概念可能是指：\n\n我们如何通过 token 的模型&方式，去重新做社交中的用户激励与利益分配？\n\n利益分配不止赚钱，例如 Dating APP 的匹配。\n\n至于 socialfi 里面的去中心化比重有多少，我认为可能没有办法做到全部环节的去中心化。\n\n比如说账号的新旧数据是用户自有的，无论是自己发的 UGC 内容还是新产生的社交图谱、关系链中的数据用户都可以自由处理与转移，这是去中心化的体现。但是最后很多环节可能避免不了要中心化，比如对于传统社交媒体和社交软件来说，它的一些核心能力与价值是掌握在平台当中的。\n\n比如对于dating app 来说核心是匹配算法，用户之间的匹配很难做到去中心化，因为会导致社交效率极低下。所以社交追求的是两件事，一个是找到的用户质量足够高，另一个是匹配精准用户的效率足够高。\n\n结合上面两点来看，我认为web3如果要将 social 和 fi 结合好，**用户质量、用户获得感、用户参与感、用户对资产的拥有和处理，**这些更偏质量的东西可能是优化的重点，而一些本身特别追求用户连接效率的社交模式不太适合做区块链的改造。\n\n## 目前对Web2社交产品的批评集中在哪些方面？Web3用户期待什么样的新社交产品？\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n如果是复刻 Web2 的产品。本身没有太大意义，因为对于用户来说除了有 token 可以挣以外并没有特别的价值。\n\n**而 token 本身的金融属性提供了很好的项目初期冷启动工具**，对前期圈一波用户有很大的帮助。比如说 Open DAO 和礼物空投 group，很可惜这两个项目后面没有能让用户留下来的产品。\n\n我体验过很多复刻，但是效果都不好。\n\n我认为从产品开发的角度讲应当跳开已有概念框架的约束去思考目前web3用户群体最大的痛点是什么，再根据痛点去找合适的产品方向。至少我发现很多人体感 discord 难用，以及安全事件屡屡发生，是否可以开发出一款专门针对 web3 用户的类 discord 通讯工具去解决用户最大的痛点与需求？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前对 web2 社交产品的批评更多集中在中心化和数据资产的所有权上，在国内这个问题不是用户直接体验到的。\n\n对于 web3 产品的新需求大家集中在社群的交流和管理的需求层面，因为目前还是用 web2 的产品discord 和 telegram 来代替的，它们毕竟不是原生的 web3 产品，各自都有一些问题。因此新的 web3产品需要瞄准用户的新需求与痛点，我赞同麻辣烫老师的观点去做 discord 的替代品，是具有一定的前景的。\n\n**陈不斯：**\n\n1\\.针对麻辣烫老师提出的痛点问题，人是否真的需要单独的社交产品？\n\nNot Boring 认为NFT是一种新型社交网络，因此是否需要一个单独平台去服务和承载是一个值得探索的思考的问题。\n\n2\\.如果社交产品是成立的，同时web3的金融属性不可避免，是否可以考虑本身就有一些经济属性或者逐利属性的社交行为？参考web2产品里的社交行为去用token经济模型改造。\n\n3\\.如果web3的金融属性可以被抛弃，发展到了用户足够大、圈层足够广泛和多样的时候，是否会跟web2产品遵循同样的方法论？“为工具而来，为网络而留”\n\nweb3相比web2来说最大的优势是互通性，代表用户的安全、隐私问题，给予用户足够的自主权，但是整体上面临的最大问题还是没有找到核心痛点让用户有动力从web2社交产品迁移到web3中去。\n\n**wegger：**\n\n很多赛道都在做socialfi的产品，发现了有以下特点：\n\n1\\.有门槛，通过爱好或者资产进行过滤。人们会偏好于小众社交，对身份的认同感在小圈子里支撑起来。\n\n2\\.socialfi在隐私领域的运营场景。\n\n3\\.技术差距不大，更倾向于思维和圈子层次的小众化，往小而精的方向发展。\n\n**taosha：**\n\nMake sense的场景：用户的数据算有权。不用证明自己做了什么事情，直接在链上数据可以看到相关资质。\n\n在招聘场景里，文凭可以作为一个 soulbound token（灵魂绑定代币），并绑定在一个作为 soul 的 did 上，不管是做 web3 领英或相亲平台，都可以从 did 的 soulbound token 中读取到我对文凭获得证明。\n\n对于项目来说，web3最大的红利是拉新获客很简单。过去我们需要在抖音、百度上买广告，而现在可以去扫描谁持有 BAYC (无聊猿)，就知道他很有钱，可以给他的地址空投一个 NFT 推销产品。\n\n在链上target用户较为精准和方便，更好地服务用户。\n\n**zoey：**\n\n思考两个问题：为了什么要做？为了谁去做？\n\nweb3 的价值定义：\n\n**1.让价值回归个体**\n\n**2.增强每个个体之间的情感链接**\n\n**3.不被平台控制的个人身份**\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n## 协议 vs 应用，对两个不同方向有什么看法？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前发展形态上是产品和协议之争。\n\n如果短期出现一个比较火的 web3 的社交产品做出圈的话，需要非常强的运营能力，单纯靠协议很难。长期看web3本身的基建更适合做重协议、轻应用的形态。\n\n大家更愿意接受社交关系和身份绑定，应用只调用社交关系，而不是到哪个产品都要再跑一遍社交关系。\n\n我长期更看好协议的发展，短期能出圈的可能还是重产品、重运营的一些社交应用。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n协议需要有用户共识，而 Social 更是直接对接终端用户\n\nSocial layer 的协议，应基于杀手级应用而诞生。\n\n因为协议是制定被大家所使用的规则，杀手级应用能为规则带来共识。\n\n特别是【社交图谱】，用户必须知道这个网友我是怎么认识的，就非常看重应用场景。所以如果要做社交图谱的协议，一定要从自带场景的 APP 起步。\n\n像 super connect 这样的项目没有这么做，我不是很能理解。\n\n**林川：**\n\nsuper connect 如果要出圈，应该会是各种想做社交的应用发现调用 super connect 这个协议会很方便，能给自己加一层社交关系，从而逐渐产生跟风效应火起来。\n\n**pengsong：**\n\n如何将 social 的记录从应用的中心化存储状态放上链，NFT可能是一个很好的选择。通过钱包地址中记录着社交关系的NFT 配合协议实现社交关系上链。\n\n但目前这个领域大家围绕 social 更多是 token 的这种经济设计，NFT 的底子比较薄弱，可能还需要半年一年的时间发展。\n\n思想转变：\n\n❌ Token 经济模型\n\n❌ 中心化数据库\n\n✅ NFT 关系网络\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n站在产业格局的角度，虽然区块链是“胖协议，瘦应用”\n\n但当A16z 对 web3 概念的炒作，其实这个概念背后蕴含着将 Web3 推广给更多用户的期待。\n\n更多的应用场景带来的不仅是对整个行业发展的促进，也意味着行业上下游的竞争。例如协议下场做应用，或应用上升做协议。\n\n因此未来可能是 **“胖协议，胖应用”** 的状态。\n\nSocial 协议提供的核心价值是什么？\n\n* 如果是数据（关系链、用户身份等），则会受应用层牵制，需要等待应用的发展与积累。难以像其它协议一样通过开发者快速迭代升级\n* 如果是技术，目前社交产品的开发门槛比较低，更看重运营，协议可能无法提供足够的价值。\n\n提升价值的建议：【数据】+【技术创新】+【增值服务】\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n## 如果是杀手级应用来开发协议的话，这个应用是否可能是由 Web2 的老家伙搞出来的？\n\n或者干脆是把 Web2 产品改造而来，例如马斯克改造推特的可能？\n\n如果说，推特能被马斯克私有化，不再服务于股东利益，通过把底层协议和用户关系贡献出来，将自己的平台价值颠覆掉，转型成一个社交公链，想象空间就太大了。\n\n而且对于web2巨头自我革命，恐怕只有马斯克有机会做到了\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\n反对，推特这样的巨鳄自我革命太难。\n\n更可能的路径是这样的：\n\n目前围绕各个公链，已经基于交易，形成了经济关系网络，而社区中空。\n\n（例如以太坊网络中60-70%的地址都在 Defi 热潮中参与了进来。但没有产品去承载这种社交关系）\n\n因此，围绕公链做社区才是方向。因为只要公链不死，关系网络就在。\n\n这是我看好的 Social fi 机会。\n\n**Eric：**\n\n看好 Web2 巨头带着自身存量转入 Web3\n\n因为网络效应太重，哪怕开发者达成共识追求理想，但难以与用户达成共识。\n\n可能只有用户的无感知迁移才行得通。\n\n**BillyWen：**\n\n曾经电报、电话时代，协议都是通的。例如你可以随时给美国朋友打电话。\n\nIM 即时通讯时代来临后，才出现应用层建墙圈用户，为了自身获利。\n\n目前 Web3 实现了货币和金融的无边界，相信未来的 web3 Social 一样没有边界。\n\n商业公司改革的确很困难，因为要追求利润。\n\n但未来10年如果有人站出来，做出了打破边界的 Social 变革，我相信他会被载入史册。\n\n**Beagle Dao：**\nWeb3 Social 有四个方面\n\n1. **基础设施、协议**\n   1. 例如 ENS 解决了钱包和名字的问题，通过 ENS 的身份社交，而非钱包地址。\n2. **社交凭证**\n   1. 例如 POAP，通过 NFT 证明你在哪里做过什么事\n3. **社交关系、社交图谱**\n4. **工具**\n   1. 【语音】例如：Clubhouse 、Twitter space\n   2. 【信息】例如：微信、邮件\n   3. 【内容】例如：推特、FB\n\n语音比较难做。\n\n信息类工具很多人在做，迁移成本高，平台不互动。\n\n可能需要大佬入场，强制或用更高的势能带动更多人加入\n\n因为 Web3 的社交关系都存在链上，所以不会像 Web2 那样重平台。\n\n更可能是共创式，每个人都做一点，拼成整个 Web3 社交的生态。\n\n观点：**Web3 社交会从B端生长出来。**\n\n对于C端而言，Web2 已经有足够好的产品了。\n\n更大的可能性是开发B端有普遍需求的工具&协议，因为B端自己懒的做而被广泛调用，因而普及。\n\n## Web2 是邪恶的吗？\n\n**Eric：**\n\n我并不认为web2 邪恶，至少有游戏规则\n\nweb2 榨取用户价值、用户体验受损的的矛盾会持续存在，但也与现在的资本市场玩法息息相关。例如开放平台都会缩回去，因为平台感觉自己把有价值的东西送出去，但却无法满足金主爸爸的期待。\n\n这种恶是人性的恶。只要 Web3 是人做的，我想一样会面对。\n\n**web3 的核心是改变价值体系，基于token 经济让系统中的各个角色都开心。**\n\n但从金融层面，怎么玩都是零和游戏。打破很难。\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n区块链不能解决人性的问题，从终局来看我会悲观，未来可能会出来新的不正义和垄断。\n\n而此刻他正在追求更公平，找到新的解决方案，这是我欣赏的。\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\nWeb3 的社交可能会更邪恶。\n\n当一个人的身份可以被 NFT 等链上方式充分定义，很多社交圈层将很容易通过技术建立门槛。你可能无法再通过找关系就加入一个大佬们会讨论问题的微信群、获得资源。可能因为你没进圈子，连吃瓜的资格都没有。\n\n但相应的，web2 当中很难走上颠覆（头部效应），在web3当中，你的努力更容易实现成功。\n\n**Red_Phoenix:**\n\n任何一个行业都有其宿命，都有其黑暗和光明。\n\n例如 Web2 的公司就一定会走向垄断和盈利，**而 Social 在 Web3 中的使命，可能是构建一个国家**，有自己共识、金融和分配方式。特别是当区块链的信用、生产力与线下产生链接时，就非常有想象力。\n\n——————————————\n\nWhoKnows DAO 将持续为大家组织优质的 Space、专题研究活动。\n\n如果你希望基于 Social fi

{"id": "npvnnKiIwTKL609RaO1knvbuC6YOuxXMn49SZiZNjq0", "title": "Aptos Incentivized Testnet Update - Aptoslabs - Medium", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*f7lwzW9yajAwsIbC4mD4Gw.jpeg)\n\nTwo weeks have passed since we first shared our plans for our [incentivized testnets](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-roadmap-209be695c77c). We are happy to share several exciting updates around eligibility requirements, selection process, expected participation slots, success criteria and rewards.\n\nBefore jumping into the details, we want to share some of our principles and goals of the Aptos Incentivized Testnet (AIT) process:\n\n*   Establish and promote the operator behavior that will lead to a successful Aptos Mainnet\n*   Emphasize the decentralized nature of the network\n*   Help foster an ecosystem for potential validator and fullnode operators\n*   Fairness and transparency in the selection process, success criteria, as well as the networks successes and failures\n\nTo those points above, we recognize that our timeline between the AIT1 registration and launch of the network places participants in a non-ideal position. This came to light as we explored the registration process, eligibility requirements, and startup time. To foster a fairer experience for all, we have adjusted the timeline for AIT1:\n\n*   May 13th — Registration date remains the same\n*   May 19th — The last day for registration\n*   May 23rd — Notification of acceptance\n*   May 24th — Beginning of AIT1\n\n## Eligibility Requirements and Registration\n\nIn order to participate in the incentivized testnet, participants must demonstrate the ability to configure and deploy a node as well as provide certain identifying information (name, residence or domicile, date of birth, etc.) and pass sanctions screening. On May 13th, we will launch a web portal that contains a registration page, instructions on how to configure and deploy your node, and node and registration status pages. Our registration site will validate that you have successfully prepared your node. At which point, you will be able to submit certain identifying information for verification and screening purposes. Upon successful completion of these tasks, you will be designated as “AIT Eligible”. The screening processes are usually fast but in some cases can take time to complete.\n\nDue to regulatory considerations within the US, US participants are able to participate but will be ineligible for token-based rewards. We are actively exploring the possibility of giving other non-token forms of rewards for successful participants based in the US, but there’s no guarantee that any such rewards will be available to US participants.\n\nAny rewards in connection with the incentivized testnet will be provided only following successful mainnet launch and any tokens provided will be subject to a one-year lockup period.\n\n## Selection Process\n\nTo be selected, you must first pass all the eligibility requirements. Beyond that we will be considering several other aspects including geographical distribution and applicant reputation. As part of the registration process, applicants will be required to specify the region in which they intend to deploy their node to ensure geographical distribution of validators. Participants that have failed in previous rounds or have exhibited dishonest behavior will be ineligible for future rounds. There will also be consideration toward applicant reputation as a node operator. Ultimately we are looking to enable general participation that helps solidify the launching of this network.\n\n## Participants, Success, and Rewards\n\n## **AIT1: Decentralized Startup**\n\n*   Number of participants: 100\n*   Success criteria\\\n    – Successfully startup node and pass liveness checks within 24 hours\\\n    – Availability more than 95% of all time\n*   Reward (non-US participants only): 500 Aptos tokens per successful participant\n\n## **AIT2: Staking**\n\n*   Number of participants: 100–500 nodes\n*   Success criteria\\\n    – Successfully startup node and pass liveness checks within 24 hours\\\n    – Availability more than 97% of all time\\\n    – Within the top 75% of consensus participants (consensus votes)\n*   Rewards (non-US participants only):\\\n    – Top 3 voter nodes get 5000, 2500, and 1000 Aptos tokens, respectively\\\n    – 500 Aptos tokens per successful participant\n\n## **AIT3: Governance and upgrades**\n\n*   Number of participants: 1000\n*   Success criteria\\\n    – Successfully startup node and pass liveness checks within 12 hours of nodes start time\\\n    – Availability more than 97% of all time\\\n    – Successfully participate in a standard network upgrade, 2 day response time\\\n    – Successfully participate in a hotfix network upgrade, 12 hour response time\\\n    – Within the top 75% of consensus participants (consensus votes)\n*   Rewards (non-US participants only):\\\n    – Top 3 voter nodes get 5000, 2500, and 1000 Aptos tokens, respectively\\\n    – 500 Aptos tokens per successful participant\n\n## **AIT4: Dynamic validator topology**\n\n*   Number of participants: 1000+\n*   Success criteria\\\n    – Successfully startup node and pass liveness checks within 12 hours of nodes start time\\\n    – The rest of the criteria is still being decided\n*   Reward (non-US participants only): 500 Aptos tokens per successful participant, additional rewards under consideration\n\n## Liveness checks are defined as your validator’s nodes ability to:\n\n*   Push metrics to Aptos telemetry\n*   Metrics port reporting metrics\n*   Connected to the official Aptos’ validator node\n*   Participating in consensus\n\n## Availability is defined as your validator node:\n\n*   Makes a proposal at least once per hour\n*   Is connected to the official Aptos’ validator node\n\n## What’s Next\n\nWe will post an announcement when the registration website launches on May 13th. In the meantime, star us on [GitHub](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aptoslabs), and join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tuDs9TmWwv) to follow along!\n", "timestamp": 1654770714, "digest": "KjZBM98CfIu1QnSUu9CoYgT13pP3JbLw-kurLNeMvCM", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}
{"id": "sLjGBw2CrD70c8IioEFJXCyIQEW5YeXGj68RgHH3Eps", "title": "区块链能否撑起元宇宙这片天", "body": "有人讲：Web3世界的尽头是元宇宙。这个观点为加密圈内人所认可。元宇宙的概念其实涵盖了我们的生活、工作与娱乐，是我们整个现实世界到虚拟世界的孪生，反过来又将会对我们的现实世界带来激烈的变革。但是，这片元宇宙的天空太大了，想要撑起来，除了VR/AR，甚至体全息等的视觉与触感，以及5G通讯和AI等技术突破外，实实在在离不开Web3的基石：区块链技术。\n\n区块链能否成为元宇宙的一根擎天柱？它能给元宇宙发展带来什么积极的作用？我们可以关注哪些这方向的区块链技术或领域?\n\n​        在这篇文章里，我们就将围绕这些问题，从元宇宙的概念和方向，以及区块链的现状和技术上，展开研究与分析，希望能为大家解开这些问题的谜团，为我们的投资或研发提供一些帮助。\n\n# 1. 什么是元宇宙？\n\n​        元宇宙，就是人类现实世界到虚拟世界一个投射：\n\n![图1 真实世界到元宇宙的投射](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mkJ9eQvJuckC4yjoPtiQy.png?height=635&width=807)\n\n​        从功能上讲，元宇宙是承载人们虚拟活动的平台，用户可以在其上进行社交、娱乐、创作、展示、教育，以及虚拟资产交易等，这些映射到我们现实世界中社会的、或精神的各方面活动。同时，它会有以下相较现实世界的突出特点：\n\n1. 没有准入门槛。\n2. 基于程序合约的公平性。\n3. 更加可靠的经济系统。\n4. 更加丰富的消费内容。\n\n​        同时，用户通过在元宇宙上进行创作、交易、学习或开会等活动，会与现实世界相结合而产生以下的感受：\n\n1. 沉浸式交互体验。\n2. 情感上的寄托。\n3. 心理上的归属。\n\n​        现在的元宇宙的Web3应用或公司，主要是以游戏为主，或者围绕着游戏而生，比如`Decentraland`、`Roblox`。因此，有人把游戏列为元宇宙的4大支柱技术（显示、通信、区块链与游戏）之一。这点其实是有失偏颇的，因为元宇宙所能承载的将不仅仅是游戏。所以应该是Web3应用，正是由这些应用板块，组成了元宇宙里的社区。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙的本质是要自由可信地承载人们的社交身份和资产权益，以及围绕着这两个的，可与现实世界相映射的所有活动。这些活动体现在元宇宙里，就是一个个Web3的应用。这其实是对现实世界底层逻辑的复制，使得元宇宙成为了一个很好的平台，让任何用户可以在它的上面创建或加入社区，参与创造，而且劳动的成果将得到保障。因此，人们在元宇宙里的劳动、交易与现实中的劳动与交易没有区别：用户在`Dencentraland`里建造的虚拟房子，可以不受平台限制，轻松交易，换成元宇宙甚至现实世界里的物品，其价格将由自由市场决定。\n\n![图2 人在元宇宙与现实世界的关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_1PcbubH_yO1UWTjXewEZ.png?height=383&width=808)\n\n​        上述元宇宙的活动，要比现实世界更加方便与可靠。因为它充分利用了区块链技术的去中心化协议与经济激励规则，通过分布式系统和程序，来保障元宇宙上活动的有序执行，与资产的抗审查确权。\n\n​        但是有人要问了：元宇宙里不管是从现实世界里采样的信息，还是直接在元宇宙里生成的信息，随着元宇宙的繁荣，就要生成现实世界方方面面的数字孪生；这对于区块链来讲，就是超多的交易，超大的数据，现在的区块链，或区块链技术（比如以太坊），能支撑的住吗？\n\n# 2. 元宇宙希望区块链提供哪些支撑？\n\n​        我们先来看看元宇宙当前主要的应用有哪些：\n\n1. 媒体舆情：像VeeR、斗鱼等主要是利用VR+5G的技术，把当下流行Web2的视频点播或VR游戏，简单搬移到了元宇宙上；倒是有个有趣的现象是视频网站从元宇宙的卡通人物里吸取灵感，给主播选换元宇宙头像，在Web2的视频网站上大受欢迎。\n2. 社交游戏：这个是最贴合元宇宙属性的场景，像腾讯就借微信、QQ的用户量在积极拓展元宇宙社交，而网易游戏、米哈游也从游戏角度纷纷杀入元宇宙。\n3. 电商会展：电商直播与电商税收成为国家整治对象，最近的疫情给会展业带来了重创，而元宇宙让电商会展看到新的契机，百度与华为都在这块有着积极的尝试。\n4. 教体文卫：这个也是元宇宙切入比较多的板块，像腾讯就联合敦煌打造元宇宙数字原生NFT，倡导元宇宙游赏敦煌石窟的游玩。\n5. 智能制造：就智能制造本身而言，它是独立的，但我们应该看到，像有些高级制造与高级维修，由于高端师傅的稀缺，因而对于分散的门店或工厂，具有远程指导与治理的真实需求，这个也是与元宇宙相契合的，但我个人只看到一些汽车的后端市场，会用到AR远程指导，还没有真正迁移到元宇宙。\n6. 政治军事：比较容易想到的利用元宇宙的3D仿真城市管理与实战演练了。\n7. 其他应用：除了以上6大类，目前对元宇宙有所涉略的还包括：数字金融、房地产、产业园和农业等。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙所能涵盖的应用或业务，远不至这些，我们大可以从经济、社会、生产、科技、教育和生活诸多方面，展开极限想象：元宇宙里资源无限，因此人们只为快乐而干活；社会将由人治走向法治，再到数学治的转变；从此创意是唯一的技能，什么学这学那的，都不需要，只要保持创造性思维能力就掌握了生产力；在元宇宙的世界里，科技似乎真的有机会触达神灵，因为元宇宙里有不断自我演进的人类智慧；学习的精髓不再是记忆而是遗忘，因为元宇宙会随时帮您记忆，并修正你曾记错的地方；生活真得将变得如此简单，互联网给大家带来的便利有目共睹，元宇宙肯定将让我们世界变得更加方便、更加简单。\n\n​        天下没有免费的午餐，元宇宙是很美好，但它离不开科技，工程，以及底层各技术的框架的支撑。下面是赵国栋老师关于元宇宙的技术框架图：\n\n![图3 元宇宙技术框架图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dj8bYtFeMXlSkbvBCtmfW.png?height=538&width=1247)\n\n​        其中红框处的`去中心化层`就是我们这里所关心的区块链。虽然赵老师这个图很好地表述了元宇宙的架构，但没能清楚地表述区块链的组成，及其层次逻辑，所以我们更乐意用下面一张图来理解元宇宙中的区块链：\n\n![图4 自商业（BAO）区块链层次架构图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rHQGobOnEIbk36fXDlU2h.png?height=390&width=664)\n\n​        这张图是ENChain.Asia的朱峰在BAO的白皮书里第一次提出`自商业`的框架图，它与元宇宙Web3应用的自主经营比较吻合。但该图里还没有很好地体现Web3应用的业务。我们知道，Web3应用其实是由两部分组成的：\n\n1. 后端：也就是运行在区块链网络上的业务处理逻辑。\n2. 前端：也就是我们一般用户看到的Web页面等。\n\n![图5 区块链业务与区块链之间的层次关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7aALil7Ix8GlpuBmckluL.png?height=484&width=664)\n\n​        其中淡橙色部分组成了元宇宙Web3应用的业务部分。而后端我们把激励层、治理层、仲裁层和合规层理解为Web3应用在区块链上，基于智能合约的逻辑处理部分，同时，为了适应元宇宙`去中心化自主治理`的业务诉求，还整合进了`自商业` 的逻辑。\n\n​        另外，也有人把区块链比作元宇宙的粘合剂，通过把终端、云计算、AI、大数据与网络相关整合一起，为元宇宙的实现建立起底层的技术基础：\n\n![图6 区块链与元宇宙其它构件关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa9gDAW30NAGrpspG1NYT.png?height=542&width=634)\n\n​        通过上面4张图，我们大体可以理解区块在元宇宙体系里，所处的位置和大概作用。下面我们来进一步分析元宇宙，期望区块链可以提供哪些基础的功能，来支撑它重建一个新世界的远大目标。\n\n​        为了更好地分析，我们把元宇宙关于区块链的诉求，分成一般性需求，和特殊性需求来看。\n\n1. 一般性需求，也就是针对一般Web3应用就需要的。\n2. 特殊性需求，则是元宇宙具体特殊的需求。\n\n​        首先，跑在元宇宙的业务应用肯定也是Web3应用，因此我们可以看到元宇宙，会对区块链提出4类一般性需求：\n\n1. 一种自我激励可靠的去中心化网络，来承载元宇宙的业务。\n2. 一种共识可信的超级账本，来记录元宇宙中活动的点点滴滴。\n3. 一种分布式的不可篡改存储，来确保元宇宙数据的真实性。\n4. 一种基于智能合约的法则，来有效约束各参与方的行为规范。\n\n​        另外，元宇宙作为一个创造新世界的庞大复杂的系统，它应会考虑以下6点，区块链不能成为它的瓶颈：\n\n1. 要能支持几乎无限丰富的应用场景。\n2. 要能支持高并发的交易量。\n3. 要能支持大吞吐的数据量。\n4. 要能与现实世界流畅沟通。\n5. 要能确保隐私。\n6. 商业经营高度自治等。\n\n​        对于一般性需求而言，众所周知，正是区块链技术所擅长的；也正是因为区块链拥有了这些能力，也给了大家想象元宇宙的空间。但元宇宙反过来，则又对区块链提出了更高的要求。下面我们重点关注**区块链可不可能支撑元宇宙的这些更高要求**？\n\n# 3. 区块链能否撑起元宇宙？\n\n## 3.1 不可能三角原则\n\n​        在回答这个问题之前，我们先来认识一下区块链的不可能三角原则。因为它将是我们下面立论的基础。\n\n![图7 区块链不可能三角](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wdG-9nqL4w2qzDiIH-nX0.png?height=569&width=940)\n\n​        区块链不可能三角（blockchain trilemma）由以太链创始人Vitalik 提出：也就是说区块链技术不能同时实现去中心化性程度、安全性和高效性。其中：\n\n1. 去中心化是指拥有大量区块生产和验证的节点，一般节点越多，去中心化程度越高。\n2. 安全性是获得网络控制权所要花费的成本，通常在共识机制的设计中锚定现实世界的资产，例如工作量证明机制锚定的是算力。\n3. 高效性就是每秒处理交易的笔数。\n\n​        正是不可能三角原则，使得各种区块链的设计与实现中，只能三者舍其一：要么是确保资本安全，共识基础牢靠；要么是单位吞吐量大，交易费便宜；要么是数据存储技术出众，存储费低廉。这也就导致现在难有一条链，或一种链就可以支撑起元宇宙的特殊需求。\n\n## 3.2 各具特色的区块链\n\n### 3.2.1 大小王\n\n​       首先就是2008年由中本聪发布的`比特币`，它标识了区块链1.0的诞生，一举奠定了区块链的思想与关键技术，是名符其实的区块链大王。比特币带给我们的区块链特征包括：\n\n1. 以区块组成的链条存储交易信息或数据。\n2. 整个区块链网络所共识且共享的超级账本，确保账本的真实性。\n3. 应用了非对称加密算法，通过公钥与私钥结合的方式搭建了区块链的安全防御系统。\n4. 源代码公开，使得区块链网络中设定的共识机制、规则等都可以通过一致的、开源的源代码进行验证。\n5. 贯彻去中心化的思想，包括中本聪到底是何许人也，到现在也不知道（否则中本聪在区块链领域的话语权要比V神大）。\n6. P2P的分布式网络，区块链网络将是去中化的分布式网络。\n\n![图8 区块链分布式网络拓扑](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Nx2DtHYV6tFddTMbucZq.png?height=638&width=641)\n\n​        人们看到，比特币在不可能三角中，特别注重了`去中心化`与`安全`,所以它的TPS特别低，且延时长；而且它脚本类的链上程序不是图灵完备的。虽然区块链1.0比较好地解决了货币发行与支付的去中心化，但应用场景还是很受限。为此区块链的小王以太坊，由Vitalik Buterin于2013年创建，它标识着区块链2.0的诞生。\n\n​        `以太坊`在比特币的基础上，创建了一个图灵完备的虚拟机EVM。因此，人们可以在以太坊上编写智能合约；理论上，可以在该EVM上实现任何复杂的逻辑。为此，Ｖ神在以太坊诞生之初，喊出了以太坊要成为`世界计算机`的口号。\n\n![图9 以太坊基于智能合约的运行机制](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9KWA4oVRVdgjIE1bXSDgI.png?height=431&width=959)\n\n​        但是以太坊的设计虽然有不少创新，但终究是脱胎于比特币，还是过于关注货币的安全与去中心化，因此它的TPS也不高，而基于智能合约的旺盛业务需求，导致了时常区块爆炸和交易费高昂等诸多问题。\n\n​        不管怎样，由于多年下来，用户没有更好的选择，以太坊业已成为Web3应用开发的首选，和业界标杆。\n\n### 3.2.2 廉价的存储\n\n​        以太坊通过智能合约，解决了市场交易的去中心化。但对用户来讲，这些交易会伴随大量的数据，而且用户也会有需要数据确权存储的需求（这点在元宇宙里将会显得特别突出）。但对于以太坊这类区块链来讲，不是功能上实现不了，而是性能上难以满足：\n\n1. `$10000+/GB年`的费用，让一般用户无法接受。\n2. `13 x 6 = 78s`的延时，让音、视频实时播放类业务只能望而止步。\n\n​        为此，Filecoin与Arweave，抓住这个痛点，纷纷推出了自己的存储区块链，以及配套的服务。我们就以Filecoin为例，来看看它是如何实现高效的数据存储与访问的。\n\n![图10 IPFS/Filecoin数据存储](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WB0EKDJaGGSus0Sg44qwI.png?height=895&width=1600)\n\n​        Filecoin如上图所示，它其实是一个体系，基于区块链的技术，来支持可靠、快速，却又廉价的链上数据存储与访问服务。其中：\n\n1. 右下部分，它实现了Filecoin基础区块链部分：\n\n* 它是标准的P2P区块链网络，但该网络只是负责存储交易及FIL激励相关事务，并不存储用户数据（比如音、视频）；\n* 数据的存储是由该网络上的各个参与节点与用户达成数据存储与访问的deal(这个交易是要上FIlecoin区块链的)，再根据IPFS格式，在节点上封装扇区，并存储数据；但该节点要负责通过ZK技术生成PoRep和PoSt证明，交给Filecoin区块链网络共识。\n\n​        事实上，存储到Filecoin网络上速度也不快，它一般只会做48小时内完成承诺，而且允许超大数据量的存储在链下完成。所以Filecoin网络上的数据存储，也被称作冷存储。\n\n1. 顶上部分，它就是实现的星际文件系统IPFS，以便基于文件的内容，并支持大数据量的存储与访问：\n\n* IPFS也是个P2P的分布式网络，但并不是区块链，因此它上面的活动并不需要共识，只是利用了分布式网络冗余备份功能；\n* 所以IPFS又被称作热存储，在Filecoin体系被用作Cache技术；\n* 但缓存在内存空间不足时很容易被清除，这样会导致用户通过IPFS请求Filecoin的存储服务，很可能会在没有完成冷存储之前，就被清除了；因此在顶部右上角，又增加了一个IPFS PIN Service，来确保用户数据可以在IPFS这个分布式网络里保存足够长的时间。\n\n1. 另一个就是上图右边的`web3.storage`之类的网关服务了，它提供了RPC API，方便用户轻松访问Filecoin网络。\n\n​        可以看到，Filecoin在充分利用区块链技术的同时，还充分结合了链外的以下辅助技术，才得以实现便宜的、支持大吞吐的、安全可信的数据存储与访问的服务：\n\n1. 零知识证明；\n2. 分布式集群；\n3. SaaS网关等。\n\n​        通过Filecoin一组产品体系的设计，它可以在获取不可能三角的去中心化和安全基础上，还获得了链上数据大吞吐访问的高效性。当然，现在大家使用下来，感觉IPFS上数据下载还是慢，这个倒是应该通过增加IPFS集群的并发处理能力，以及Web3.Storage等API网关的网络带宽来解决。\n\n### 3.2.3 突破交易量的瓶颈\n\n​        继了解决大吞吐数据存储方案后，那再来看元宇宙关于支持交易高并发的诉求。我们都知道，比特币原始链和以太链的交易并发数并不多，时延反而长，交易费反而高：\n\n![表1 比特币与以太坊TPS等性能](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4jUkffUHKsGKaI7O5ok-6.png?height=292&width=1267)\n\n​        这些弱点，仅让以太坊或比特币来支持元宇宙是不可能的。也正是看到这些弱点，各Layer2扩容方案纷纷出台，或者有的链干脆另起炉灶，完全设计出一条独立的支持高交易量的链：\n\n1. Layer2 扩容方案：它的思想本质就是通过将交易的处理从Layer1的区块链，迁移到了被称Layer2层，并对该处理生成一个证明，而Layer1层只作关于该证明的验证；而验证证明的计算量小很多，从而可以大幅地降低Layer1层区块链的负荷，也就提升了整个区块链业务TPS；当然Layer2层还会用到Sequenser等排序与压缩技术，来进一步提高TPS；目前Layer2的扩容路线主要是Rollup，它能实现Layer1层1\\~2个数量级的扩容。\n\n![图11 Layer2扩容方案](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4JES24OdSA0OKMoR9DHFI.png?height=214&width=600)\n\n1. Layer1独立链交易量的极致突破：它直接让Layer1区块链本身拥有更高的TPS；它往往是以牺牲安全或去中心化来获取更高的单位时间交易量；其中典型的案例有Solana，它的设计中一个时间点只有一个Leader节点出块，而其它的节点只对块中的交易进行验证；因为它的出块，再不是区块链网络里所有节点竞争，所以它会快许多，但显然安全性会下降许多；为此Solana设计了随时间单向的PoH协议，以及TowerBFT协议等，来尽量弥补单个Leader出块中心化不安全的弱点；Solana的TPS可达5万+。\n\n![图12 Solana架构](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J9s2wlVpj7aqm2F7qR-7Y.png?height=713&width=1244)\n\n​          据Solana白皮书介绍，基于Solana链的交易量瓶颈不再在链本身，而在网络带宽。\n\n### 3.2.4 跨链\n\n​        从前面3个小节的分析，我们确实可以看到，区块链有的去中化程度高，安全可靠，有的可以突破TPS瓶颈，有的则可以很好满足便宜可信大数据量的存储。这些都是元宇宙所需要的。为此，除了独立区块链分布式网络相关的技术外，还需要相关跨链技术，把不同的区块链连接起来，促使它们之间货币信息的流通，甚至可以互操作。对应着这种技术的产品，被大家形象地称为跨链桥。\n\n​        V神把跨链技术的演进和实现方式，总结为3类：\n\n1. 哈希时间锁合约：通过一套密码学方法，来实现不同链上资产的交易；但只能是资产类交易，不能实现资产在不同链上流通，更不能互操作了；下面2张图就显示了基于哈希锁和时间锁，实现将比特币交换成以太的过程：\n\n![图13 存币上锁](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GHT0_1ieqENqiDYTSv4Vl.png?height=87&width=621)\n\n![图14 开锁取币](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HkZWHPwe6oruFM7Vxscat.png?height=76&width=600)\n\n1. 公证人机制：是由公证人建立一个中间账户，用户将资产转入中间账户，由公证人跨链发行一种映射原Token的影子Token给到用户；当用户需要赎回的时候，将影子Token销毁，并向公证人提供证明，公证人将中间账户的原始Token转到该用户的地址；基于公证人的方案，可以实现资产在不同链，或异构链上流通；但这个流通的可信度，是依赖于这个第三方公证人可信度的。\n2. 桥接链方案：它是当前主流的跨链技术；与公证人方案一样，仍然存在一个中间账户，但中间账户的安全，不靠公证人来保护，而是靠智能合约来规范，这意味着中间账户将是一个合约账户，其资产管理规则被智能合约的代码约束，而不是由公证人约束；如果代码本身没有问题，只要部署该合约的链是安全的，那么合约中的资产就是安全的；像波卡和Cosmos不仅要实现支持资产流通，甚至支持它们同构子链之间的互操作。\n\n​        要说明的一点是：桥接链应搭建在双图灵完备的链间，因为桥接链不是一个独立的存在，而需要部署在两端链上的合约配合，就像一座桥不能悬空存在，必须在两岸有桥墩作为依托一样。\n\n![图15 桥接链示意](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Syb4-mlnSJTO4nLF8Ytqb.png?height=312&width=604)\n\n​        而桥接链方案又可分成3个流派：\n\n1. 通用跨链派：它专注于跨链，旨在实现适配区块链领域存在的所有链，其典型代表是Polygon\n\n![图16 Polygon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ypmulFxPaLzQodIhTVLnq.png?height=328&width=602)\n\n​        上图中的蓝色图标就表示是Polygon。但细心的你会发现它是以`以太坊`为中心的。因为Polygon的目标是`实现一个以太坊兼容链的互联网`。但我们前面讨论了，在元宇宙里，除了以太坊，还需要有诸如Filecoin等的区块链网络；并且对于元宇宙业务应用来讲，尽管以太坊已成为许多人认可的`世界记账机`，也不一定就是中心（区块链应该排斥中心的）。\n\n1. 引流跨链派：它往往是Layer1的独立链，需要借用以太坊更丰富的货币体系，以及引流以太坊上大量的免教育用户，其典型代表有Solana Wormhole\n\n![图17 Solana Wormhole](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pjTsdcJKkZ28zPrfW1hZh.png?height=410&width=539)\n\n​        Wormhole在以太坊与Solana之间，搭建一条双向、去中心化的 ERC-20⇄SPL 代币桥。Solana主打的这条`trustless`桥，让以太坊的DeFi交易者和应用，在两条链上进行资产转换，并享受Solana的高TPS和低转账成本的服务；而且基于Wormhole，开发者可以继续使用之前为以太坊编写的智能合约。细心的你有可能发现上图左下角的`Terra`作为Luna的基础链，已经崩了；这里还选用这张图，主要是想警示大家，在通过跨链技术，连接不同区块链时，注意链想到之间产生`连环雪崩`灾害；这是元宇宙安全所在，由于安全问题不在是本篇文章的重点，就不展开了。\n\n1. 互操作跨链流派：它不仅要实现不同链之间代币的流通，更专注于链之间的`互操作`,链之间真正的互联互通，其典型代表有Polkadot最新发布的XCM\n\n![图18 波卡XCMP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a4hSares12VFUJ0EjIS4w.png?height=272&width=523)\n\n​        XCM是波卡的跨共识消息格式（Cross-Consensus Messaging format）的简称，XCM不仅支持链之间的通信，还支持智能合约、Dapp和Substrate pallet（模块）之间的通信，从而实现了不同链之间的消息传递，与类似RPC调用的互操作。但我们也应看到：XCM不能用于在系统之间实际“发送”任何消息，它的效用只在于表达接收者应该做什么；XCM是消息格式，需要搭配消息传递协议使用，才能完成消息的跨链。还有就是，XCM只适用于Polkadot家族中的平行链之间的跨链。\n\n​        通过上面的分析我们可以知道，由于不同链之间的共识机制，所有虚拟机和智能合约架构的不同，链之间的互联互通，还是有不少难度。但经过不同厂商的努力，我们也看到现在的跨链桥技术，已基本可以将不同的功能的区块链技术捏合在一起，来打破区块链的不可能三角，从而满足以元宇宙既要去中心化，又要安全，还要高效的诉求。\n\n​        另注：跨链桥这块，作者推荐大家关注Polkadot与Cosmos之类专注链互操作的区块链体系。因为它们理论上可以构建各种功能和特色的链，而且这些链在同一体系下，在设计之初，就充分考虑了跨链互联的需求。\n\n## 3.3 满足不可能三角之后呢？\n\n​        通过3.2节的分析，我们知道，基于跨链桥技术，可以将具有不同功能与特色的链连接起来，从而使得不可能三角的安全性、去中心化和高效性的三者兼得。但元宇宙的特殊需求尚不止于此。\n\n### 3.3.1 可用不可见的隐私计算\n\n​        元宇宙尽管是个虚拟世界，但其中还是关联到现实生活中的，会附带着各种数字资产，以及大量的个人隐私信息。所以在元宇宙里往往会采用DID（去中心化的身份证），来绑定用户在元宇宙里的身份，并进而把与之相关的资产和数据归之名下。\n\n​        这个小节我们主要谈谈用户链上数据隐私保护的问题。我们可以发现以下几点前提：\n\n1. 首先，这些数据要是为元宇宙所有用户认可的，所以数据就应存放在去中心化的区块链网络上，比如Filecoin。\n2. 为了保护隐私，这些数据应是加密存储，只有用户自身才能读取其中的内容。\n3. 但这些隐私数据如果元宇宙不能使用，那就无法提取该用户的相关属性，也难以为该用户提供更好的服务。\n\n![图19 元宇宙渔业监管](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1fQLBoiODE8PdrAiTGpVX.png?height=391&width=762)\n\n​        如上图，`元宇宙渔业监管部门`需要监查`元宇宙渔船`是否超出了捕捞海域，需要渔船的`元宇宙海域坐标`；渔船认为该坐标信息是它的隐私，不便提供；而监管部门没有坐标是没有办法监管。因此现实世界里，只能由监管部门强制收取，最后由于职权部门的泄密，导致个人安全或利益受损，个人往往也只能认倒霉。\n\n​        我们知道，数据的处理包括三个环节：传输、存储与计算。其中，传输、存储的安全已有相关技术，但数据的`安全计算`一直没有一条通用性的方案，也就是讲，现有的数据安全计算方案，往往只能应用于特定的场景。我们对数据安全计算的目标，主要定位在`数据可用不可见`上，所以又将数据安全计算，称为`隐私计算`。由于数据已成为最重要的生产资料，隐私计算将显得越来越重要。当前的主要的隐私计算技术分类有：\n\n![图20 隐私计算分类](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VboHK1kz7SirkXmQMJJID.png?height=241&width=1370)\n\n        基于以上分析，元宇宙也是需要隐私计算的技术，来确保用户隐私数据的`可用不可见`；而且为了节约网络带宽资源，实现的隐私计算功能模块，**应当贴近区块链端**。其中`零知识证明`技术，已在区块链里被广泛使用。前面我们提到过，像Filecoin里的PoRep与PoSt就利用了零知识证明。但这项技术只能证明数据存储行为本身，并不能从该数据里抽取有用的属性，比如渔船越界了。为此，在元宇宙里，还应充分利用`联邦学习`，`可信执行环境`等技术，并把它们有机结合起来：\n\n1. 搭建`联邦学习`等AI计算集群，提供支持保护隐私的神经网络训练与预判环境，为元宇宙提供类似人工智能感知层，但这个感知是去中心化的。\n2. 搭建可信执行环境，由于该环境需要支持AI的训练与计算，所以元宇宙里的可信执行环境是服务器集群级别，与手机和安全卡之类的可信执行环境，在物理上不是一个量级。\n\n​        其是在元宇宙里联邦学习集群与可信执行环境集群，可以合二为一，形成一种类似`PaaS`的服务。作者认为，这应该是元宇宙的一项基础构件，像元宇宙中社区自治（DAO）中，特别倚重的声誉系统，没有AI，没有确保隐私的AI，学习性、公正性、有效性就难以保证。想要建立元宇宙的良性生态，不妨先把这个基础服务做起来。如果您看好元宇宙，这将是一块真正的`busyness`。但目前似乎少有企业或组织，真正把它当作业务，或者以PaaS、BaaS的眼光来看待它。\n\n### 3.3.2 Oracle沟通物理世界\n\n​        通过3.3.1小节的讨论，我们通过采用多种隐私计算技术，可以保障元宇宙中用户个体数据的隐私安全。但如果区块链相以支撑起元宇宙，我们认为尚有不足，因为元宇宙不仅仅是现实世界的搬迁，它还需要与物理世界的交流与互动。像海尔在组建的元宇宙工厂，如不与现实工厂相关联，对海尔来讲是没有意义的。\n\n​        元宇宙与物理世界的交互，其实就是物理世界信息要更新到元宇宙的区块链网络中，而区块链网络处理的结果，应该反映到现实中去。这种交互，就需要所谓的Oracle技术（预言机）。该技术在DeFi里使用比较多，其中典型的代表就是Chainlink。\n\n![图21 Chainlink Oracle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i84z-1bztLjgvRtgBUsZe.png?height=365&width=591)\n\n​        它的工作机制是：\n\n```\n  1. Chainlink构成了一个去中心化的分布式网络，并通过Oracle合约与以太坊等区块链锚定。\n  2. 用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Adapter服务；该服务会从不物理信源处采集所需要的信息，比如各DEX关于LINK Token的价格，进行汇总，并根据用户的喜好采用这些信息，调用Oracle合约，自动触发相关的链上交易。\n  3. 链上的逻辑处理完好，又可以调用Oracle合约，将信息返回给Chainlink网络；用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Initiator服务；该服务根据Oracle返回的信息，再触发现实世界的相关交易。\n```\n\n​        元宇宙与现实世界的沟通，也需要诸如Chainlink之类的Oracle技术：使得两个世界息息相生。\n\n### 3.3.3 DAO\n\n​        经过上面的分析，我们就来看看最后一个点：那就是元宇宙的商业自治。这个诉求与区块链的DAO是极其吻合的。\n\n![图22 DAO示意](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KTYENeIiMoYbUyLwoLgbR.png?height=402&width=601)\n\n​        DAO是指去中心化自治组织，它伴随区块链而诞生，并一经出现，就热度不减。因为它有以下鲜明的特点：\n\n1. 去中心化、自动化和透明，所有要遵守的规则都由链上公开的智能合约来定。\n2. 社区驱动，规则的决定与调整，也就是组织的决策权，赋予社区里所有的代币持有者，由大家投票裁决；往往这种权力是与社员持有代币量成正比；因而让社区成为利益休戚相关且真正民主。\n3. 具有潜在的投资回报，DAO中所持有的治理代币，正如初创公司早期持有的股权：后面一旦成功，这些代币会非常有价值。\n\n​        这里，我们应将DAO的治理代币，与区块链的原生代币区别开来。原生代币是区块链网络为了维护其网络生态繁荣的经济激励措施而发行，从某种意义上讲，是存在类似`货币超发`现象，或讲超前消费嫌疑。而DAO的治理代币，它应是绑定在社区实际的成长上的：只有社区有价值，它的治理代币才会有价值。当然，不可否认，DAO的治理代币也起着经济激励的基础作用，如第2章中的7层架构中的`激励层`所示，它将给予社区美好的预期，促进社区成员，为着共同的目标一起努力。这点是与元宇宙的自商业完全一致。\n\n​        但是，我们也要看到DAO的一个致命的弱点：什么事都要靠投票来决定。这样，当有问题时，特别是重大紧急问题时，也要通过投票解决？2016年以太坊的`The Dao`事故，仍然历历在目。以太坊的做法是人为干涉，但这又与去中心化思想相悖，从而为人所诟病，并由此导致了以太坊的硬分叉。所以，元宇宙在社区自治过程中，还应设计好此类事件的应对方案。\n\n# 4. 结论\n\n​        元宇宙还有很长的路要走，但它美好的前景，值得Facebook去投入，也值我们所有人去追寻。元宇宙少不了区块链，这点已为业界共识。同时，从上面的分析来看，通过组合不同的区块链，以及隐私计算等相关技术，是有机会支撑起元宇宙的各类应用，以及对大家对元宇宙未来的畅想。\n\n​        当然，区块链相关的技术还有待发展，这也何尝不是机会。作者认为，我们可以重点关注：\n\n1. 开放式的跨链桥技术，将元宇宙需要的各种链有机、灵活地连接起来。\n2. 集成联邦学习与可信执行环境集群的BaaS服务。\n3. 具有通识基础的元宇宙声誉系统，打造元宇宙的DAO，建立基于`数字治`的良序公约。", "timestamp": 1654770879, "digest": "hYOaJFFtLrlJ3_CSClzJo_hAwKYb9-6w6dwK1_WaLQM", "contributor": "0x8fB6C85590aC6fFd0Dc31A95800C084F2DaAb5fe"}

"有人讲：Web3世界的尽头是元宇宙。这个观点为加密圈内人所认可。元宇宙的概念其实涵盖了我们的生活、工作与娱乐，是我们整个现实世界到虚拟世界的孪生，反过来又将会对我们的现实世界带来激烈的变革。但是，这片元宇宙的天空太大了，想要撑起来，除了VR/AR，甚至体全息等的视觉与触感，以及5G通讯和AI等技术突破外，实实在在离不开Web3的基石：区块链技术。\n\n区块链能否成为元宇宙的一根擎天柱？它能给元宇宙发展带来什么积极的作用？我们可以关注哪些这方向的区块链技术或领域?\n\n​        在这篇文章里，我们就将围绕这些问题，从元宇宙的概念和方向，以及区块链的现状和技术上，展开研究与分析，希望能为大家解开这些问题的谜团，为我们的投资或研发提供一些帮助。\n\n# 1. 什么是元宇宙？\n\n​        元宇宙，就是人类现实世界到虚拟世界一个投射：\n\n![图1 真实世界到元宇宙的投射](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mkJ9eQvJuckC4yjoPtiQy.png?height=635&width=807)\n\n​        从功能上讲，元宇宙是承载人们虚拟活动的平台，用户可以在其上进行社交、娱乐、创作、展示、教育，以及虚拟资产交易等，这些映射到我们现实世界中社会的、或精神的各方面活动。同时，它会有以下相较现实世界的突出特点：\n\n1. 没有准入门槛。\n2. 基于程序合约的公平性。\n3. 更加可靠的经济系统。\n4. 更加丰富的消费内容。\n\n​        同时，用户通过在元宇宙上进行创作、交易、学习或开会等活动，会与现实世界相结合而产生以下的感受：\n\n1. 沉浸式交互体验。\n2. 情感上的寄托。\n3. 心理上的归属。\n\n​        现在的元宇宙的Web3应用或公司，主要是以游戏为主，或者围绕着游戏而生，比如`Decentraland`、`Roblox`。因此，有人把游戏列为元宇宙的4大支柱技术（显示、通信、区块链与游戏）之一。这点其实是有失偏颇的，因为元宇宙所能承载的将不仅仅是游戏。所以应该是Web3应用，正是由这些应用板块，组成了元宇宙里的社区。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙的本质是要自由可信地承载人们的社交身份和资产权益，以及围绕着这两个的，可与现实世界相映射的所有活动。这些活动体现在元宇宙里，就是一个个Web3的应用。这其实是对现实世界底层逻辑的复制，使得元宇宙成为了一个很好的平台，让任何用户可以在它的上面创建或加入社区，参与创造，而且劳动的成果将得到保障。因此，人们在元宇宙里的劳动、交易与现实中的劳动与交易没有区别：用户在`Dencentraland`里建造的虚拟房子，可以不受平台限制，轻松交易，换成元宇宙甚至现实世界里的物品，其价格将由自由市场决定。\n\n![图2 人在元宇宙与现实世界的关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_1PcbubH_yO1UWTjXewEZ.png?height=383&width=808)\n\n​        上述元宇宙的活动，要比现实世界更加方便与可靠。因为它充分利用了区块链技术的去中心化协议与经济激励规则，通过分布式系统和程序，来保障元宇宙上活动的有序执行，与资产的抗审查确权。\n\n​        但是有人要问了：元宇宙里不管是从现实世界里采样的信息，还是直接在元宇宙里生成的信息，随着元宇宙的繁荣，就要生成现实世界方方面面的数字孪生；这对于区块链来讲，就是超多的交易，超大的数据，现在的区块链，或区块链技术（比如以太坊），能支撑的住吗？\n\n# 2. 元宇宙希望区块链提供哪些支撑？\n\n​        我们先来看看元宇宙当前主要的应用有哪些：\n\n1. 媒体舆情：像VeeR、斗鱼等主要是利用VR+5G的技术，把当下流行Web2的视频点播或VR游戏，简单搬移到了元宇宙上；倒是有个有趣的现象是视频网站从元宇宙的卡通人物里吸取灵感，给主播选换元宇宙头像，在Web2的视频网站上大受欢迎。\n2. 社交游戏：这个是最贴合元宇宙属性的场景，像腾讯就借微信、QQ的用户量在积极拓展元宇宙社交，而网易游戏、米哈游也从游戏角度纷纷杀入元宇宙。\n3. 电商会展：电商直播与电商税收成为国家整治对象，最近的疫情给会展业带来了重创，而元宇宙让电商会展看到新的契机，百度与华为都在这块有着积极的尝试。\n4. 教体文卫：这个也是元宇宙切入比较多的板块，像腾讯就联合敦煌打造元宇宙数字原生NFT，倡导元宇宙游赏敦煌石窟的游玩。\n5. 智能制造：就智能制造本身而言，它是独立的，但我们应该看到，像有些高级制造与高级维修，由于高端师傅的稀缺，因而对于分散的门店或工厂，具有远程指导与治理的真实需求，这个也是与元宇宙相契合的，但我个人只看到一些汽车的后端市场，会用到AR远程指导，还没有真正迁移到元宇宙。\n6. 政治军事：比较容易想到的利用元宇宙的3D仿真城市管理与实战演练了。\n7. 其他应用：除了以上6大类，目前对元宇宙有所涉略的还包括：数字金融、房地产、产业园和农业等。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙所能涵盖的应用或业务，远不至这些，我们大可以从经济、社会、生产、科技、教育和生活诸多方面，展开极限想象：元宇宙里资源无限，因此人们只为快乐而干活；社会将由人治走向法治，再到数学治的转变；从此创意是唯一的技能，什么学这学那的，都不需要，只要保持创造性思维能力就掌握了生产力；在元宇宙的世界里，科技似乎真的有机会触达神灵，因为元宇宙里有不断自我演进的人类智慧；学习的精髓不再是记忆而是遗忘，因为元宇宙会随时帮您记忆，并修正你曾记错的地方；生活真得将变得如此简单，互联网给大家带来的便利有目共睹，元宇宙肯定将让我们世界变得更加方便、更加简单。\n\n​        天下没有免费的午餐，元宇宙是很美好，但它离不开科技，工程，以及底层各技术的框架的支撑。下面是赵国栋老师关于元宇宙的技术框架图：\n\n![图3 元宇宙技术框架图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dj8bYtFeMXlSkbvBCtmfW.png?height=538&width=1247)\n\n​        其中红框处的`去中心化层`就是我们这里所关心的区块链。虽然赵老师这个图很好地表述了元宇宙的架构，但没能清楚地表述区块链的组成，及其层次逻辑，所以我们更乐意用下面一张图来理解元宇宙中的区块链：\n\n![图4 自商业（BAO）区块链层次架构图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rHQGobOnEIbk36fXDlU2h.png?height=390&width=664)\n\n​        这张图是ENChain.Asia的朱峰在BAO的白皮书里第一次提出`自商业`的框架图，它与元宇宙Web3应用的自主经营比较吻合。但该图里还没有很好地体现Web3应用的业务。我们知道，Web3应用其实是由两部分组成的：\n\n1. 后端：也就是运行在区块链网络上的业务处理逻辑。\n2. 前端：也就是我们一般用户看到的Web页面等。\n\n![图5 区块链业务与区块链之间的层次关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7aALil7Ix8GlpuBmckluL.png?height=484&width=664)\n\n​        其中淡橙色部分组成了元宇宙Web3应用的业务部分。而后端我们把激励层、治理层、仲裁层和合规层理解为Web3应用在区块链上，基于智能合约的逻辑处理部分，同时，为了适应元宇宙`去中心化自主治理`的业务诉求，还整合进了`自商业` 的逻辑。\n\n​        另外，也有人把区块链比作元宇宙的粘合剂，通过把终端、云计算、AI、大数据与网络相关整合一起，为元宇宙的实现建立起底层的技术基础：\n\n![图6 区块链与元宇宙其它构件关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa9gDAW30NAGrpspG1NYT.png?height=542&width=634)\n\n​        通过上面4张图，我们大体可以理解区块在元宇宙体系里，所处的位置和大概作用。下面我们来进一步分析元宇宙，期望区块链可以提供哪些基础的功能，来支撑它重建一个新世界的远大目标。\n\n​        为了更好地分析，我们把元宇宙关于区块链的诉求，分成一般性需求，和特殊性需求来看。\n\n1. 一般性需求，也就是针对一般Web3应用就需要的。\n2. 特殊性需求，则是元宇宙具体特殊的需求。\n\n​        首先，跑在元宇宙的业务应用肯定也是Web3应用，因此我们可以看到元宇宙，会对区块链提出4类一般性需求：\n\n1. 一种自我激励可靠的去中心化网络，来承载元宇宙的业务。\n2. 一种共识可信的超级账本，来记录元宇宙中活动的点点滴滴。\n3. 一种分布式的不可篡改存储，来确保元宇宙数据的真实性。\n4. 一种基于智能合约的法则，来有效约束各参与方的行为规范。\n\n​        另外，元宇宙作为一个创造新世界的庞大复杂的系统，它应会考虑以下6点，区块链不能成为它的瓶颈：\n\n1. 要能支持几乎无限丰富的应用场景。\n2. 要能支持高并发的交易量。\n3. 要能支持大吞吐的数据量。\n4. 要能与现实世界流畅沟通。\n5. 要能确保隐私。\n6. 商业经营高度自治等。\n\n​        对于一般性需求而言，众所周知，正是区块链技术所擅长的；也正是因为区块链拥有了这些能力，也给了大家想象元宇宙的空间。但元宇宙反过来，则又对区块链提出了更高的要求。下面我们重点关注**区块链可不可能支撑元宇宙的这些更高要求**？\n\n# 3. 区块链能否撑起元宇宙？\n\n## 3.1 不可能三角原则\n\n​        在回答这个问题之前，我们先来认识一下区块链的不可能三角原则。因为它将是我们下面立论的基础。\n\n![图7 区块链不可能三角](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wdG-9nqL4w2qzDiIH-nX0.png?height=569&width=940)\n\n​        区块链不可能三角（blockchain trilemma）由以太链创始人Vitalik 提出：也就是说区块链技术不能同时实现去中心化性程度、安全性和高效性。其中：\n\n1. 去中心化是指拥有大量区块生产和验证的节点，一般节点越多，去中心化程度越高。\n2. 安全性是获得网络控制权所要花费的成本，通常在共识机制的设计中锚定现实世界的资产，例如工作量证明机制锚定的是算力。\n3. 高效性就是每秒处理交易的笔数。\n\n​        正是不可能三角原则，使得各种区块链的设计与实现中，只能三者舍其一：要么是确保资本安全，共识基础牢靠；要么是单位吞吐量大，交易费便宜；要么是数据存储技术出众，存储费低廉。这也就导致现在难有一条链，或一种链就可以支撑起元宇宙的特殊需求。\n\n## 3.2 各具特色的区块链\n\n### 3.2.1 大小王\n\n​       首先就是2008年由中本聪发布的`比特币`，它标识了区块链1.0的诞生，一举奠定了区块链的思想与关键技术，是名符其实的区块链大王。比特币带给我们的区块链特征包括：\n\n1. 以区块组成的链条存储交易信息或数据。\n2. 整个区块链网络所共识且共享的超级账本，确保账本的真实性。\n3. 应用了非对称加密算法，通过公钥与私钥结合的方式搭建了区块链的安全防御系统。\n4. 源代码公开，使得区块链网络中设定的共识机制、规则等都可以通过一致的、开源的源代码进行验证。\n5. 贯彻去中心化的思想，包括中本聪到底是何许人也，到现在也不知道（否则中本聪在区块链领域的话语权要比V神大）。\n6. P2P的分布式网络，区块链网络将是去中化的分布式网络。\n\n![图8 区块链分布式网络拓扑](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Nx2DtHYV6tFddTMbucZq.png?height=638&width=641)\n\n​        人们看到，比特币在不可能三角中，特别注重了`去中心化`与`安全`,所以它的TPS特别低，且延时长；而且它脚本类的链上程序不是图灵完备的。虽然区块链1.0比较好地解决了货币发行与支付的去中心化，但应用场景还是很受限。为此区块链的小王以太坊，由Vitalik Buterin于2013年创建，它标识着区块链2.0的诞生。\n\n​        `以太坊`在比特币的基础上，创建了一个图灵完备的虚拟机EVM。因此，人们可以在以太坊上编写智能合约；理论上，可以在该EVM上实现任何复杂的逻辑。为此，Ｖ神在以太坊诞生之初，喊出了以太坊要成为`世界计算机`的口号。\n\n![图9 以太坊基于智能合约的运行机制](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9KWA4oVRVdgjIE1bXSDgI.png?height=431&width=959)\n\n​        但是以太坊的设计虽然有不少创新，但终究是脱胎于比特币，还是过于关注货币的安全与去中心化，因此它的TPS也不高，而基于智能合约的旺盛业务需求，导致了时常区块爆炸和交易费高昂等诸多问题。\n\n​        不管怎样，由于多年下来，用户没有更好的选择，以太坊业已成为Web3应用开发的首选，和业界标杆。\n\n### 3.2.2 廉价的存储\n\n​        以太坊通过智能合约，解决了市场交易的去中心化。但对用户来讲，这些交易会伴随大量的数据，而且用户也会有需要数据确权存储的需求（这点在元宇宙里将会显得特别突出）。但对于以太坊这类区块链来讲，不是功能上实现不了，而是性能上难以满足：\n\n1. `$10000+/GB年`的费用，让一般用户无法接受。\n2. `13 x 6 = 78s`的延时，让音、视频实时播放类业务只能望而止步。\n\n​        为此，Filecoin与Arweave，抓住这个痛点，纷纷推出了自己的存储区块链，以及配套的服务。我们就以Filecoin为例，来看看它是如何实现高效的数据存储与访问的。\n\n![图10 IPFS/Filecoin数据存储](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WB0EKDJaGGSus0Sg44qwI.png?height=895&width=1600)\n\n​        Filecoin如上图所示，它其实是一个体系，基于区块链的技术，来支持可靠、快速，却又廉价的链上数据存储与访问服务。其中：\n\n1. 右下部分，它实现了Filecoin基础区块链部分：\n\n* 它是标准的P2P区块链网络，但该网络只是负责存储交易及FIL激励相关事务，并不存储用户数据（比如音、视频）；\n* 数据的存储是由该网络上的各个参与节点与用户达成数据存储与访问的deal(这个交易是要上FIlecoin区块链的)，再根据IPFS格式，在节点上封装扇区，并存储数据；但该节点要负责通过ZK技术生成PoRep和PoSt证明，交给Filecoin区块链网络共识。\n\n​        事实上，存储到Filecoin网络上速度也不快，它一般只会做48小时内完成承诺，而且允许超大数据量的存储在链下完成。所以Filecoin网络上的数据存储，也被称作冷存储。\n\n1. 顶上部分，它就是实现的星际文件系统IPFS，以便基于文件的内容，并支持大数据量的存储与访问：\n\n* IPFS也是个P2P的分布式网络，但并不是区块链，因此它上面的活动并不需要共识，只是利用了分布式网络冗余备份功能；\n* 所以IPFS又被称作热存储，在Filecoin体系被用作Cache技术；\n* 但缓存在内存空间不足时很容易被清除，这样会导致用户通过IPFS请求Filecoin的存储服务，很可能会在没有完成冷存储之前，就被清除了；因此在顶部右上角，又增加了一个IPFS PIN Service，来确保用户数据可以在IPFS这个分布式网络里保存足够长的时间。\n\n1. 另一个就是上图右边的`web3.storage`之类的网关服务了，它提供了RPC API，方便用户轻松访问Filecoin网络。\n\n​        可以看到，Filecoin在充分利用区块链技术的同时，还充分结合了链外的以下辅助技术，才得以实现便宜的、支持大吞吐的、安全可信的数据存储与访问的服务：\n\n1. 零知识证明；\n2. 分布式集群；\n3. SaaS网关等。\n\n​        通过Filecoin一组产品体系的设计，它可以在获取不可能三角的去中心化和安全基础上，还获得了链上数据大吞吐访问的高效性。当然，现在大家使用下来，感觉IPFS上数据下载还是慢，这个倒是应该通过增加IPFS集群的并发处理能力，以及Web3.Storage等API网关的网络带宽来解决。\n\n### 3.2.3 突破交易量的瓶颈\n\n​        继了解决大吞吐数据存储方案后，那再来看元宇宙关于支持交易高并发的诉求。我们都知道，比特币原始链和以太链的交易并发数并不多，时延反而长，交易费反而高：\n\n![表1 比特币与以太坊TPS等性能](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4jUkffUHKsGKaI7O5ok-6.png?height=292&width=1267)\n\n​        这些弱点，仅让以太坊或比特币来支持元宇宙是不可能的。也正是看到这些弱点，各Layer2扩容方案纷纷出台，或者有的链干脆另起炉灶，完全设计出一条独立的支持高交易量的链：\n\n1. Layer2 扩容方案：它的思想本质就是通过将交易的处理从Layer1的区块链，迁移到了被称Layer2层，并对该处理生成一个证明，而Layer1层只作关于该证明的验证；而验证证明的计算量小很多，从而可以大幅地降低Layer1层区块链的负荷，也就提升了整个区块链业务TPS；当然Layer2层还会用到Sequenser等排序与压缩技术，来进一步提高TPS；目前Layer2的扩容路线主要是Rollup，它能实现Layer1层1\\~2个数量级的扩容。\n\n![图11 Layer2扩容方案](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4JES24OdSA0OKMoR9DHFI.png?height=214&width=600)\n\n1. Layer1独立链交易量的极致突破：它直接让Layer1区块链本身拥有更高的TPS；它往往是以牺牲安全或去中心化来获取更高的单位时间交易量；其中典型的案例有Solana，它的设计中一个时间点只有一个Leader节点出块，而其它的节点只对块中的交易进行验证；因为它的出块，再不是区块链网络里所有节点竞争，所以它会快许多，但显然安全性会下降许多；为此Solana设计了随时间单向的PoH协议，以及TowerBFT协议等，来尽量弥补单个Leader出块中心化不安全的弱点；Solana的TPS可达5万+。\n\n![图12 Solana架构](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J9s2wlVpj7aqm2F7qR-7Y.png?height=713&width=1244)\n\n​          据Solana白皮书介绍，基于Solana链的交易量瓶颈不再在链本身，而在网络带宽。\n\n### 3.2.4 跨链\n\n​        从前面3个小节的分析，我们确实可以看到，区块链有的去中化程度高，安全可靠，有的可以突破TPS瓶颈，有的则可以很好满足便宜可信大数据量的存储。这些都是元宇宙所需要的。为此，除了独立区块链分布式网络相关的技术外，还需要相关跨链技术，把不同的区块链连接起来，促使它们之间货币信息的流通，甚至可以互操作。对应着这种技术的产品，被大家形象地称为跨链桥。\n\n​        V神把跨链技术的演进和实现方式，总结为3类：\n\n1. 哈希时间锁合约：通过一套密码学方法，来实现不同链上资产的交易；但只能是资产类交易，不能实现资产在不同链上流通，更不能互操作了；下面2张图就显示了基于哈希锁和时间锁，实现将比特币交换成以太的过程：\n\n![图13 存币上锁](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GHT0_1ieqENqiDYTSv4Vl.png?height=87&width=621)\n\n![图14 开锁取币](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HkZWHPwe6oruFM7Vxscat.png?height=76&width=600)\n\n1. 公证人机制：是由公证人建立一个中间账户，用户将资产转入中间账户，由公证人跨链发行一种映射原Token的影子Token给到用户；当用户需要赎回的时候，将影子Token销毁，并向公证人提供证明，公证人将中间账户的原始Token转到该用户的地址；基于公证人的方案，可以实现资产在不同链，或异构链上流通；但这个流通的可信度，是依赖于这个第三方公证人可信度的。\n2. 桥接链方案：它是当前主流的跨链技术；与公证人方案一样，仍然存在一个中间账户，但中间账户的安全，不靠公证人来保护，而是靠智能合约来规范，这意味着中间账户将是一个合约账户，其资产管理规则被智能合约的代码约束，而不是由公证人约束；如果代码本身没有问题，只要部署该合约的链是安全的，那么合约中的资产就是安全的；像波卡和Cosmos不仅要实现支持资产流通，甚至支持它们同构子链之间的互操作。\n\n​        要说明的一点是：桥接链应搭建在双图灵完备的链间，因为桥接链不是一个独立的存在，而需要部署在两端链上的合约配合，就像一座桥不能悬空存在，必须在两岸有桥墩作为依托一样。\n\n![图15 桥接链示意](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Syb4-mlnSJTO4nLF8Ytqb.png?height=312&width=604)\n\n​        而桥接链方案又可分成3个流派：\n\n1. 通用跨链派：它专注于跨链，旨在实现适配区块链领域存在的所有链，其典型代表是Polygon\n\n![图16 Polygon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ypmulFxPaLzQodIhTVLnq.png?height=328&width=602)\n\n​        上图中的蓝色图标就表示是Polygon。但细心的你会发现它是以`以太坊`为中心的。因为Polygon的目标是`实现一个以太坊兼容链的互联网`。但我们前面讨论了，在元宇宙里，除了以太坊，还需要有诸如Filecoin等的区块链网络；并且对于元宇宙业务应用来讲，尽管以太坊已成为许多人认可的`世界记账机`，也不一定就是中心（区块链应该排斥中心的）。\n\n1. 引流跨链派：它往往是Layer1的独立链，需要借用以太坊更丰富的货币体系，以及引流以太坊上大量的免教育用户，其典型代表有Solana Wormhole\n\n![图17 Solana Wormhole](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pjTsdcJKkZ28zPrfW1hZh.png?height=410&width=539)\n\n​        Wormhole在以太坊与Solana之间，搭建一条双向、去中心化的 ERC-20⇄SPL 代币桥。Solana主打的这条`trustless`桥，让以太坊的DeFi交易者和应用，在两条链上进行资产转换，并享受Solana的高TPS和低转账成本的服务；而且基于Wormhole，开发者可以继续使用之前为以太坊编写的智能合约。细心的你有可能发现上图左下角的`Terra`作为Luna的基础链，已经崩了；这里还选用这张图，主要是想警示大家，在通过跨链技术，连接不同区块链时，注意链想到之间产生`连环雪崩`灾害；这是元宇宙安全所在，由于安全问题不在是本篇文章的重点，就不展开了。\n\n1. 互操作跨链流派：它不仅要实现不同链之间代币的流通，更专注于链之间的`互操作`,链之间真正的互联互通，其典型代表有Polkadot最新发布的XCM\n\n![图18 波卡XCMP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a4hSares12VFUJ0EjIS4w.png?height=272&width=523)\n\n​        XCM是波卡的跨共识消息格式（Cross-Consensus Messaging format）的简称，XCM不仅支持链之间的通信，还支持智能合约、Dapp和Substrate pallet（模块）之间的通信，从而实现了不同链之间的消息传递，与类似RPC调用的互操作。但我们也应看到：XCM不能用于在系统之间实际“发送”任何消息，它的效用只在于表达接收者应该做什么；XCM是消息格式，需要搭配消息传递协议使用，才能完成消息的跨链。还有就是，XCM只适用于Polkadot家族中的平行链之间的跨链。\n\n​        通过上面的分析我们可以知道，由于不同链之间的共识机制，所有虚拟机和智能合约架构的不同，链之间的互联互通，还是有不少难度。但经过不同厂商的努力，我们也看到现在的跨链桥技术，已基本可以将不同的功能的区块链技术捏合在一起，来打破区块链的不可能三角，从而满足以元宇宙既要去中心化，又要安全，还要高效的诉求。\n\n​        另注：跨链桥这块，作者推荐大家关注Polkadot与Cosmos之类专注链互操作的区块链体系。因为它们理论上可以构建各种功能和特色的链，而且这些链在同一体系下，在设计之初，就充分考虑了跨链互联的需求。\n\n## 3.3 满足不可能三角之后呢？\n\n​        通过3.2节的分析，我们知道，基于跨链桥技术，可以将具有不同功能与特色的链连接起来，从而使得不可能三角的安全性、去中心化和高效性的三者兼得。但元宇宙的特殊需求尚不止于此。\n\n### 3.3.1 可用不可见的隐私计算\n\n​        元宇宙尽管是个虚拟世界，但其中还是关联到现实生活中的，会附带着各种数字资产，以及大量的个人隐私信息。所以在元宇宙里往往会采用DID（去中心化的身份证），来绑定用户在元宇宙里的身份，并进而把与之相关的资产和数据归之名下。\n\n​        这个小节我们主要谈谈用户链上数据隐私保护的问题。我们可以发现以下几点前提：\n\n1. 首先，这些数据要是为元宇宙所有用户认可的，所以数据就应存放在去中心化的区块链网络上，比如Filecoin。\n2. 为了保护隐私，这些数据应是加密存储，只有用户自身才能读取其中的内容。\n3. 但这些隐私数据如果元宇宙不能使用，那就无法提取该用户的相关属性，也难以为该用户提供更好的服务。\n\n![图19 元宇宙渔业监管](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1fQLBoiODE8PdrAiTGpVX.png?height=391&width=762)\n\n​        如上图，`元宇宙渔业监管部门`需要监查`元宇宙渔船`是否超出了捕捞海域，需要渔船的`元宇宙海域坐标`；渔船认为该坐标信息是它的隐私，不便提供；而监管部门没有坐标是没有办法监管。因此现实世界里，只能由监管部门强制收取，最后由于职权部门的泄密，导致个人安全或利益受损，个人往往也只能认倒霉。\n\n​        我们知道，数据的处理包括三个环节：传输、存储与计算。其中，传输、存储的安全已有相关技术，但数据的`安全计算`一直没有一条通用性的方案，也就是讲，现有的数据安全计算方案，往往只能应用于特定的场景。我们对数据安全计算的目标，主要定位在`数据可用不可见`上，所以又将数据安全计算，称为`隐私计算`。由于数据已成为最重要的生产资料，隐私计算将显得越来越重要。当前的主要的隐私计算技术分类有：\n\n![图20 隐私计算分类](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VboHK1kz7SirkXmQMJJID.png?height=241&width=1370)\n\n        基于以上分析，元宇宙也是需要隐私计算的技术，来确保用户隐私数据的`可用不可见`；而且为了节约网络带宽资源，实现的隐私计算功能模块，**应当贴近区块链端**。其中`零知识证明`技术，已在区块链里被广泛使用。前面我们提到过，像Filecoin里的PoRep与PoSt就利用了零知识证明。但这项技术只能证明数据存储行为本身，并不能从该数据里抽取有用的属性，比如渔船越界了。为此，在元宇宙里，还应充分利用`联邦学习`，`可信执行环境`等技术，并把它们有机结合起来：\n\n1. 搭建`联邦学习`等AI计算集群，提供支持保护隐私的神经网络训练与预判环境，为元宇宙提供类似人工智能感知层，但这个感知是去中心化的。\n2. 搭建可信执行环境，由于该环境需要支持AI的训练与计算，所以元宇宙里的可信执行环境是服务器集群级别，与手机和安全卡之类的可信执行环境，在物理上不是一个量级。\n\n​        其是在元宇宙里联邦学习集群与可信执行环境集群，可以合二为一，形成一种类似`PaaS`的服务。作者认为，这应该是元宇宙的一项基础构件，像元宇宙中社区自治（DAO）中，特别倚重的声誉系统，没有AI，没有确保隐私的AI，学习性、公正性、有效性就难以保证。想要建立元宇宙的良性生态，不妨先把这个基础服务做起来。如果您看好元宇宙，这将是一块真正的`busyness`。但目前似乎少有企业或组织，真正把它当作业务，或者以PaaS、BaaS的眼光来看待它。\n\n### 3.3.2 Oracle沟通物理世界\n\n​        通过3.3.1小节的讨论，我们通过采用多种隐私计算技术，可以保障元宇宙中用户个体数据的隐私安全。但如果区块链相以支撑起元宇宙，我们认为尚有不足，因为元宇宙不仅仅是现实世界的搬迁，它还需要与物理世界的交流与互动。像海尔在组建的元宇宙工厂，如不与现实工厂相关联，对海尔来讲是没有意义的。\n\n​        元宇宙与物理世界的交互，其实就是物理世界信息要更新到元宇宙的区块链网络中，而区块链网络处理的结果，应该反映到现实中去。这种交互，就需要所谓的Oracle技术（预言机）。该技术在DeFi里使用比较多，其中典型的代表就是Chainlink。\n\n![图21 Chainlink Oracle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i84z-1bztLjgvRtgBUsZe.png?height=365&width=591)\n\n​        它的工作机制是：\n\n```\n  1. Chainlink构成了一个去中心化的分布式网络，并通过Oracle合约与以太坊等区块链锚定。\n  2. 用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Adapter服务；该服务会从不物理信源处采集所需要的信息，比如各DEX关于LINK Token的价格，进行汇总，并根据用户的喜好采用这些信息，调用Oracle合约，自动触发相关的链上交易。\n  3. 链上的逻辑处理完好，又可以调用Oracle合约，将信息返回给Chainlink网络；用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Initiator服务；该服务根据Oracle返回的信息，再触发现实世界的相关交易。\n```\n\n​        元宇宙与现实世界的沟通，也需要诸如Chainlink之类的Oracle技术：使得两个世界息息相生。\n\n### 3.3.3 DAO\n\n​        经过上面的分析，我们就来看看最后一个点：那就是元宇宙的商业自治。这个诉求与区块链的DAO是极其吻合的。\n\n![图22 DAO示意](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KTYENeIiMoYbUyLwoLgbR.png?height=402&width=601)\n\n​        DAO是指去中心化自治组织，它伴随区块链而诞生，并一经出现，就热度不减。因为它有以下鲜明的特点：\n\n1. 去中心化、自动化和透明，所有要遵守的规则都由链上公开的智能合约来定。\n2. 社区驱动，规则的决定与调整，也就是组织的决策权，赋予社区里所有的代币持有者，由大家投票裁决；往往这种权力是与社员持有代币量成正比；因而让社区成为利益休戚相关且真正民主。\n3. 具有潜在的投资回报，DAO中所持有的治理代币，正如初创公司早期持有的股权：后面一旦成功，这些代币会非常有价值。\n\n​        这里，我们应将DAO的治理代币，与区块链的原生代币区别开来。原生代币是区块链网络为了维护其网络生态繁荣的经济激励措施而发行，从某种意义上讲，是存在类似`货币超发`现象，或讲超前消费嫌疑。而DAO的治理代币，它应是绑定在社区实际的成长上的：只有社区有价值，它的治理代币才会有价值。当然，不可否认，DAO的治理代币也起着经济激励的基础作用，如第2章中的7层架构中的`激励层`所示，它将给予社区美好的预期，促进社区成员，为着共同的目标一起努力。这点是与元宇宙的自商业完全一致。\n\n​        但是，我们也要看到DAO的一个致命的弱点：什么事都要靠投票来决定。这样，当有问题时，特别是重大紧急问题时，也要通过投票解决？2016年以太坊的`The Dao`事故，仍然历历在目。以太坊的做法是人为干涉，但这又与去中心化思想相悖，从而为人所诟病，并由此导致了以太坊的硬分叉。所以，元宇宙在社区自治过程中，还应设计好此类事件的应对方案。\n\n# 4. 结论\n\n​        元宇宙还有很长的路要走，但它美好的前景，值得Facebook去投入，也值我们所有人去追寻。元宇宙少不了区块链，这点已为业界共识。同时，从上面的分析来看，通过组合不同的区块链，以及隐私计算等相关技术，是有机会支撑起元宇宙的各类应用，以及对大家对元宇宙未来的畅想。\n\n​        当然，区块链相关的技术还有待发展，这也何尝不是机会。作者认为，我们可以重点关注：\n\n1. 开放式的跨链桥技术，将元宇宙需要的各种链有机、灵活地连接起来。\n2. 集成联邦学习与可信执行环境集群的BaaS服务。\n3. 具有通识基础的元宇宙声誉系统，打造元宇宙的DAO，建立基于`数字治`的良序公约。", "timestamp": 1654770879, "digest": "hYOaJFFtLrlJ3_CSClzJo_hAwKYb9-6w6dwK1_WaLQM", "contributor": "0x8fB6C85590aC6fFd0Dc31A95800C084F2DaAb5fe"}

Peers can validate and synchronize over 10k transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second latency in Aptos today, and we’re already on our way to 100k+ TPS.**\n\n## Overview\n\nState synchronization (or state sync) is an important but often overlooked aspect of blockchain design. In this blogpost, we discuss the evolution of state sync at Aptos and present several key insights behind the design of the latest state sync protocol. We further explore how we recently increased state sync throughput by 10x, reduced latency by 3x, and are continuing to pave the way for faster, more efficient blockchain synchronization.\n\n## What is state sync?\n\nMost blockchains today are structured hierarchically, with a set of active validators at the heart of the network. The validators grow the blockchain by executing transactions, producing blocks and achieving consensus. The rest of the peers in the network (e.g., fullnodes and clients) replicate the blockchain data produced by the validators (e.g., blocks and transactions). State sync is the protocol that allows non-validator peers to distribute, verify and persist this blockchain data and ensures that all peers in the ecosystem are synchronized. See the diagram below for what this looks like at Aptos.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XesMBhS5rLVIiluTme0nlw.png)\n\nAptos Ecosystem (Overview)\n\n## Why does state sync matter?\n\nState sync is rarely mentioned when evaluating blockchains: it is often a footnote in a whitepaper dedicated to more interesting topics\\*. However, state sync has significant consequences on blockchain performance, security, and user experience. Consider the following:\n\n1.  **Time to finality and user experience:** When new transactions are executed by validators, state sync is responsible for propagating the data to peers and clients. If state sync is slow or unreliable, peers will perceive long transaction processing delays, artificially inflating the time to finality. This has a huge impact on user experience, e.g., decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and payment processing will all be much slower.\n2.  **Relationship with consensus:** Validators that crash or fall behind the rest of the validator set rely on state sync to bring them back up to speed (i.e., synchronize the latest blockchain state). If state sync cannot process transactions as quickly as they are executed by consensus, crashed validators will never be able to recover. Moreover, new validators will never be able to start participating in consensus (as they won’t ever catch up!) and fullnodes will never be able to sync to the latest state (they’ll continue to fall further behind!).\n3.  **Implications on decentralization**: Having a quick, efficient and scalable state sync protocol allows for: (i) faster rotations of an active validator set, as validators can move in and out of consensus more freely; (ii) more potential validators to choose from in the network; (iii) more fullnodes to come online quickly and without having to wait long periods of time; and (iv) lower resource requirements, increasing heterogeneity. All of these factors increase decentralization in the network and help to scale the blockchain in size and geography.\n4.  **Data correctness**: State sync is responsible for verifying the correctness of all blockchain data during synchronization. This prevents malicious peers and adversaries in the network from modifying, censoring or fabricating transaction data and presenting it as valid. If state sync fails to do this (or does it incorrectly), fullnodes and clients could be tricked into accepting invalid data and this would have devastating consequences on the network.\n\n## Reasoning about state sync\n\nTo better reason about state sync, we first introduce a generic model for blockchain execution. While this model targets the Aptos blockchain specifically, it can be generalized to others.\n\nWe model the Aptos blockchain as a simple versioned database, where at each version **V** there is a unique blockchain state **Sⱽ** containing all on-chain accounts and resources. A transaction **T** can be executed by the Aptos virtual machine (VM) on state **Sⱽ** to produce a state delta **Dᵀᵥ **representing all state modifications that would occur on **Sⱽ **should **T **be committed. When **Dᵀᵥ** is applied to **Sⱽ** (that is, we consider **T** committed), it results in a new version **V+1** and a new blockchain state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We refer to the very first blockchain state as the genesis state **S⁰**. The diagrams below show transaction execution and state delta application.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZwNwY2c1kg8mYrQ-pmHziA.png)\n\nTransaction Execution and State Delta Application (Model)\n\n## What are the goals?\n\nWith a generic model in place, we can now define several fundamental goals for state sync\\*\\*:\n\n1.  **High-throughput**: State sync should maximize the amount of transactions that can be synchronized by each peer per second. That is, maximize the rate of state transitions from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹** for each **T **committed by the validators. If throughput is low it increases syncing time and becomes a bottleneck for the network.\n2.  **Low latency**: State sync should minimize the time it takes up-to-date peers to synchronize new transactions committed by validators. That is, minimize the time it takes peers at **Sⱽ** to sync to **Sⱽ⁺¹**, for each **T** that is newly committed by the validators. This affects the overall time to finality perceived by clients.\n3.  **Fast bootstrapping time**: State sync should minimize the time it takes new (or crashed) peers to sync to the latest state of the blockchain. That is, minimize the time it takes to sync to **Sⱽ **(where **V** is the highest database version agreed by the validators) regardless of the peer’s current version **P** and state **Sᴾ**. This allows peers to perform useful work more quickly (e.g., respond to balance queries or validate transactions).\n4.  **Resistance to failures and malicious actors:** State sync should be resistant to failures (e.g., machine and network failures) and tolerate malicious actors in the network, including other peers. This means overcoming a wide-variety of attacks, e.g., fabricated transaction data, modified or replayed network messages, and [eclipse attacks](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin).\n5.  **Tolerant of resource constraints and heterogeneity:** State sync should tolerate resource constraints (e.g., CPU, memory and storage) and embrace heterogeneity. Given the nature of decentralized networks, peers will have access to different types of hardware and optimize for different goals. State sync should account for this.\n\n## The required building blocks\n\nWe next introduce a set of fundamental building blocks required to construct a state sync protocol. For the sake of brevity, we provide a summary of each building block below and defer the technical details to future work (each of these could be a blogpost, itself!):\n\n1.  **Persistent storage:** To persist data across machine crashes and failures (and enable data distribution to other peers!) we require that each peer has access to trusted persistent storage. At Aptos, we’re currently using [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) but are actively exploring other options.\n2.  **Verifiable blockchain data:** To prevent malicious actors from modifying blockchain data, we require data to be authenticated and verifiable. Specifically, we need to be able to prove: (i) every transaction **T** that has been executed and committed by validators; (ii) the order of every transaction **T** executed and committed by validators; and (iii) the resulting blockchain states **Sⱽ** after committing each transaction **T**. At Aptos, we achieve this by: (i) building [merkle trees](https://aptos.dev/basics/basics-merkle-proof/) over committed transactions and the resulting blockchain states; and (ii) having validators sign the merkle roots of these trees to authenticate them.\n3.  **A root of trust:** Given that Aptos supports dynamic validator sets (i.e., changes to validators at each epoch), peers need to be able to identify the current validator set from a verified history of the Aptos blockchain. We achieve this through: (i) a **genesis blob** authenticated by Aptos, which identifies the first validator set and initial blockchain state **S⁰**; and (ii) a **recent** **trusted waypoint** (e.g., a hash of the current validator set and blockchain state **Sⱽ**). Together, the genesis blob and waypoint form a root of trust allowing peers to synchronize the real Aptos blockchain and prevent attacks (e.g., [long-range attacks](https://dlt-repo.net/long-range-attack-in-proof-of-stake-pos-blockchains/)).\n\n## Achieving 1k TPS: A naive approach\n\nUsing the model and building blocks presented above, we can now illustrate a naive state sync protocol. This protocol is a simplification of the original protocol used by Aptos (i.e., `state sync v1`).\n\nThe protocol works as follows: (i) `Alice` (the syncing peer) identifies the highest local persisted blockchain version **V** and state **Sⱽ**. If none exists, `Alice` uses genesis, i.e., **S⁰**; (ii) `Alice` then randomly selects a peer, `Bob`, and requests any new sequential transactions that have been committed by the validators; (iii) if `Alice` receives a response from `Bob`, `Alice` will verify the new transactions (**T⁰ **to **Tᴺ**) and execute them to produce state delta’s (**D⁰ᵥ** to **Dᵀᵥ**₊ₙ); (iv) `Alice` will then apply the new state delta’s to storage along with the new transactions, updating the local state of the blockchain from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹⁺ᴺ**. `Alice` repeats this loop indefinitely. Pseudocode for the protocol looks as follows:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BNHW7j2GMZYb9pGe1lFvgw.png)\n\nState Sync v1 (Pseudocode)\n\nWe implemented this protocol at Aptos, benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), and analyzed it. Some of the key observations we made were:\n\n1.  **Throughput is network latency bound**: This protocol achieves a maximum of `~1.2k TPS`. However, throughput is heavily affected by network latencies as `Alice` requests data sequentially and must wait for the peer to respond. Given that we’re seeing an average network round trip time (RTT) of `150ms` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), this is suboptimal.\n2.  **CPU is dominated by execution**: When `Alice` receives a new set of transactions to synchronize, we see that `55%` of the CPU time is spent executing the transactions and `40%` is spent verifying the data, applying the state deltas to storage and persisting the new transactions. The other `5%` is attributed to message handling, serialization and other tasks.\n3.  **Latency is high**: When running the network at maximum load, the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~900 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is primarily due to `Alice` randomly selecting peers when requesting data and not taking into account the network topology: peers that are closer to the validators will receive new transactions sooner.\n4.  **Bootstrapping is slow**: The protocol above requires `Alice` to replay and synchronize all transactions since genesis. If `Alice` is far behind the latest state, she must wait a long period of time before being able to do anything useful (this might take hours or even days!).\n5.  **Performance is easily manipulated**: The performance of this protocol is heavily influenced by malicious peers. As identified in 1 above, intentionally slow (or non-responsive) peers will force `Alice` to spend long periods of time waiting for data and not doing anything. Thus, significantly increasing synchronization time.\n6.  **Resource usage is high**: This protocol is expensive for all resource types: (i) CPU usage is high because `Alice` must re-execute all transactions; (ii) storage is high because `Alice` must store all transactions and blockchain states since genesis; and (iii) network usage is high because `Alice` must receive all transactions since genesis via the network. This automatically imposes high costs and resource requirements, reducing heterogeneity.\n7.  **Resources are wasted**: While `Alice` is synchronizing new data, peers in the network are also synchronizing from her. As the number of peers requesting data from `Alice` grows, there is an additional read load placed onto storage and CPU required to handle these requests. However, much of the computation that `Alice` performs to handle these requests is wasteful as peers are often requesting the same data.\n\n## Achieving 10k TPS: An optimized approach\n\nLooking at the naive protocol above, we can make a number of modifications to help address the limitations. First, we extend the protocol to support 2 additional modes of synchronization:\n\n1.  **State delta syncing**: Given that validators already execute transactions and attest to the resulting blockchain states through merkle proofs, peers can rely on the state deltas produced by the validators to skip transaction execution. This avoids: (i) the high cost of execution, reducing CPU time by about `55%`; and (ii) the need for an Aptos VM, greatly simplifying a delta syncing implementation. As a result, peers can now synchronize by downloading each transaction **T** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** and applying them to storage to produce the new state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We note that this comes at the cost of increased network usage (by approx. `2.5x`).\n2.  **Blockchain snapshot syncing**: Given that validators attest to each blockchain state **Sⱽ**, we can further reduce bootstrapping time by allowing peers to download the latest blockchain state directly (instead of having to produce it using transactions or state deltas). This significantly reduces bootstrapping time and is a similar approach to [snap-sync](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/) in Ethereum. The trade-off is that peers will not store any transactions or blockchain states prior to **Sⱽ**.\n\nNext, we implement a number of general optimizations and additional features to help improve performance and scalability:\n\n1.  **Data prefetching**: To prevent network latencies from impacting throughput, we can perform data prefetching. Peers can prefetch transaction data (e.g., transactions and state deltas) from other peers before processing them, amortizing network latencies.\n2.  **Pipelined execution and storage**: To further increase syncing throughput, we can separate transaction execution from storage persistence and use pipelining: a commonly used [optimization in processor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-and-architecture-pipelining-set-1-execution-stages-and-throughput/) design. This allows a transaction **T²** to be executed while a transaction **T¹** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** are concurrently persisted to storage.\n3.  **Peer monitoring and reputation:** To improve observability and better tolerate malicious peers, we can implement a peer monitoring service to: (i) monitor peers for malicious behaviors (e.g., transferring invalid data); (ii) identify metadata about each peer, such as a summary of all transaction data the peer has and their perceived distance from the validator set; and (iii) maintain a local score for each peer. This information can then be used to optimize peer selection when requesting new blockchain data.\n4.  **Data caching**: To reduce the read load on storage and prevent state sync from performing redundant computations as more and more peers synchronize, we can implement a data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory.\n5.  **Storage pruning:** To prevent storage from continuously growing over time (e.g., as more transactions are committed), we can also implement dynamic pruners to remove unnecessary transaction and blockchain data from storage, e.g., anything older than a few days, weeks or months, depending on the peer configuration.\n\nWe implemented these modifications and produced a new state sync protocol (i.e., `state sync v2`). We benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) and observed:\n\n1.  **Throughput increased by 5x-10x**: When executing transactions, the protocol now achieves a maximum of `~4.5k TPS`, primarily as a result of pipelining and data prefetching (i.e., the protocol is now able to fully saturate the CPU). When synchronizing state deltas the protocol achieves well over `10K TPS`, a further result of avoiding transaction execution. In both cases, throughput is no longer affected by network latency.\n2.  **Latency was reduced by 3x**: While running the network at maximum load, we now see that the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~300 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is due to data prefetching and more efficient peer selection: peers who are more responsive and closer to the validators are contacted more frequently.\n3.  **Bootstrapping is significantly faster**: Peers who use blockchain snapshot syncing are able to bootstrap much more quickly. Moreover, bootstrapping time is no longer affected by the length of the blockchain (i.e., the number of transactions), but rather the number of on-chain resources to synchronize. Currently in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), peers can bootstrap within minutes\\*\\*\\*.\n4.  **Resource requirements are reduced**: With multiple synchronization modes and storage pruning, resource requirements have been reduced. Moreover, there is now support for heterogeneity as peers have flexibility to select the syncing strategy. For example: (i) peers with limited CPU can skip transaction execution; (ii) peers with limited storage can configure the pruner to be aggressive; and (iii) peers that wish to get up-to-date quickly can perform blockchain snapshot syncing.\n5.  **Resources are more efficiently used**: When handling syncing requests from peers, we see a significantly reduced read load on storage and less wasted CPU. This is due to the new data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory. We also see that as the number of syncing peers grows in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), the data cache becomes more efficient, e.g., with `20` syncing peers we see a cache hit rate of `70%-80%` per request. But, with `60` peers we see a cache hit rate of `93%-98%`. This comes at the cost of an additional `~150 MB` of RAM to maintain the cache.\n\n## 100k TPS and beyond?\n\nWhile we’ve already improved throughput by 10x and latency by 3x, we realize that there is still more to be done. Especially if we want to match [Block-STM](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/block-stm-how-we-execute-over-160k-transactions-per-second-on-the-aptos-blockchain-3b003657e4ba) and make *Aptos a Layer 1 for everyone*!\n\nSo, how are we going to get there? Well, we’ve already started on our next state sync goal: 100k+ TPS! Although, we’re planning to save the details for a future blogpost we did want to provide some hints to the very keen reader:\n\n1.  **Transaction** **batching**: Currently, Aptos treats every transaction as verifiable, i.e., the merkle proofs used to authenticate and verify data operate at the transaction granularity. This makes verification and storage incredibly expensive. One way to avoid this is to perform transaction batching, i.e., proofs over batches (or blocks!) of transactions.\n2.  **Network compression**: Network bandwidth often becomes a bottleneck in peer-to-peer networks and Aptos is no exception. Currently, the state sync prefetcher can fetch around `~45K TPS` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) before saturating bandwidth. This is an issue if we want to scale. Thankfully, we’ve already recognized that peers are distributing data using an inefficient serialization format and by using off the shelf compression we can reduce the amount of transmitted data by more than `10x`.\n3.  **Faster storage writes:** Currently, state sync throughput is bottlenecked by the time it takes to persist blockchain data to storage. We’re actively looking at different optimizations and improvements that we can make to remove this bottleneck, including: (i) more efficient data structures; (ii) more optimal storage configurations; and (iii) alternate storage engines.\n4.  **Parallel data processing**: Until now, we’ve required that state sync process data sequentially (e.g., handle transactions at sequentially increasing versions). However, there are a number of existing approaches that would allow us to avoid this requirement and exploit parallel data processing to significantly increase throughput, e.g., blockchain sharding!\n\nUntil next time!\n\n*If you are, like us, passionate about designing algorithms, putting them in practice, and making a real impact on the future of Web3, please reach out — we are *[*hiring*](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/)* at Aptos.*\n\n\\*Like consensus :)\\\n\\*\\*We implicitly assume that state sync must synchronize the states of **all on-chain resources**. Partial syncing strategies (e.g., light-clients that target specific accounts) are out of scope and will be discussed in the future.\\\n\\*\\*\\*This metric should be taken with a heap of salt. The Aptos [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) is wiped bi-weekly, so there is limited state to synchronize. More evaluation will be required on longer running networks (e.g., our incentivized [testnets](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-roadmap-209be695c77c)).\n", "timestamp": 1654770911, "digest": "Fdi_wegYZT0MUt8fntG9Qt2CG-vz1vUhRxD2hHA7oek", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}

In fact, I think most people already have a high degree of emotional intelligence.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are held back from using their innate emotional intelligence by a collection of bad habits that get in the way.\n\nIf you’d like to improve your emotional intelligence, learn to identify these habits in your own life and work to eliminate them. I think you’ll find that your natural emotional intelligence is not far behind.\n\n1. Criticizing Others\n   Criticizing others is often an unconscious defense mechanism aimed at alleviating our own insecurities.\n\nWe’re all critical sometimes. And it’s not necessarily a bad thing — to think carefully and critically about the world around us is a vital skill. It helps us navigate the world and our relationships in an objective way.\n\nBut too much criticism — especially the habit of being critical of others — can lead to the opposite of objectivity: it can make us narrow-minded and blind, especially to ourselves.\n\nOne of the reasons it’s so easy to slip into habitually criticizing others is that it makes us feel good:\n\nWhen you point out to yourself that someone else is dumb, you’re also implying that you’re smart. And that feels good.\nWhen you criticize someone else for being naive, what you’re really doing is telling yourself that you’re sophisticated. And that feels good.\nWhen you silently chuckle to yourself about how terrible someone’s fashion sense is, you’re telling yourself how refined your own taste is. And that feels good.\nHelpful criticism is about making the world better. Unhelpful criticism is about making yourself feel better.\n\nWhile being critical might temporarily make you feel good about yourself, it usually makes you feel worse about yourself in the long-term.\n\nOn the other hand, emotionally intelligent and self-aware people understand that criticizing others is just a primitive defense mechanism. And that there are far better, more productive ways of dealing with our anxieties and insecurities.\n\nWithout knowing it, people who are constantly critical of others are really just trying to alleviate their own insecurities.\n\nUnderstand that criticism of others is a waste of time and energy because it’s all time and energy that’s not getting invested in improving yourself and the world around you.\n\n“Criticism of others is a form of self-commendation. We think we make the picture hang straight on our wall by telling our neighbors that all his pictures are crooked.”\n\n― Fulton J. Sheen\n\n1. Worrying About the Future\n   Worrying about the future means living in denial about the fundamentally uncertain nature of life.\n\nAs human beings we crave order and certainty. And for good reason: Our ancestors who were better at making their lives a little less uncertain probably survived longer than those who didn’t. We’re biologically motivated to reduce uncertainty.\n\nBut there’s a big difference between taking reasonable steps to reduce uncertainty and being so terrified by it that we delude ourselves into believing we can eliminate it altogether.\n\nAnd that’s what chronic worriers. They’re so afraid of uncertainty, and so unwilling to live with it, that they trick themselves into thinking they can make the future less uncertain — by thinking about it constantly!\n\nChronic worriers live under the illusion that thinking is always problem-solving and that planning always leads to greater levels of preparedness. But neither of those are true:\n\nJust because you’re thinking about a problem doesn’t mean you’re thinking about it productively.\nAnd just because you’re planning — running through countless hypothetical future scenarios — doesn’t mean you’re any better equipped to handle them. Often, you’re just making yourself feel more prepared.\nWorry gives you the illusion of certainty. But in the end, all it does is fragilize you.\n\nEmotionally intelligent people understand that life is inherently uncertain. And they understand that it’s better to face up to this reality clear-eyed than to live in denial about it.\n\nBecause when you stop beating yourself down with all the stress and anxiety that comes with chronic worry, you’d be surprised how much energy and enthusiasm returns to your life.\n\nWhen you stop insisting that the world act the way you want it to tomorrow, it becomes far easier to work with the world you’ve got today.\n\n“Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength.”\n\n― Corrie Ten Boom\n\n1. Ruminating on the Past\n   Ruminating on past mistakes is a misguided attempt at control.\n\nJust like we humans crave order and certainty, we also crave control. We’re obsessed with the idea that, with enough effort and perseverance, we can do or achieve anything.\n\nOf course, most people who get stuck ruminating endlessly on past mistakes and failures don’t actually believe that they can change the past. Instead, ruminating about the past gives them the illusion of control, however fleeting and temporary.\n\nWhen you’ve done something bad or made a mistake in the past, you naturally feel guilt and regret. Chronic ruminators develop the unconscious habit of constantly replaying past mistakes because it briefly gives them a feeling of control. And feeling in control helps distract from feeling helpless — which is what we really are when it comes to past mistakes.\n\nIn reality, no amount of rumination or analysis of your past mistakes will change what happened. Which means helplessness and powerlessness are inevitable.\n\nThis is a hard fact of life that emotionally intelligent people not only understand, but accept.\n\nIf you want to move on with your life instead of staying stuck in the past, you must accept the past for what it is—including feeling helpless.\n\nYou must give up the choice to endlessly revisit it, no matter how much it distracts you from your real pain — the pain of helplessness.\n\nWhen in doubt, take action in the present instead of dwelling on the past. Do something useful, right now, now matter how small — and resist the temptation to replay yet another scene from your past.\n\nDon’t give up control over your future by pretending you can control the past.\n\n“To think too much is a disease.”\n\n― Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\n1. Maintaining Unrealistic Expectations\n   Unrealistic expectations are a misguided attempt to control other people.\n\nJust like ruminating is an attempt to control the past and how we feel about it, maintaining unrealistic expectations is usually a subtle attempt to control other people.\n\nOf course, most people with unrealistic expectations don’t see it that way. You probably see your expectations of other people as a good thing: Having high expectations for people encourages them to grow and mature and become their best self!\n\nMaybe, but this is still a subtle form of control. You have an idea for what another person in your life should be or do or accomplish and your expectation is your way of trying to make it happen.\n\nBut what does it mean, exactly, to maintain an unrealistic expectation?\n\nSimply put, it means you spend time crafting stories in your head about what other people should do. And when they inevitably fail to live up to those standards, you reflexively compare reality to those expectations and feel frustrated and disappointed.\n\nAnd how do you respond to this frustration and disappointment? By creating even stronger and more elaborate expectations, because it makes you feel good and in control!\n\nLook, of course you care about the people in your life and want the best for them. And it pains you to see them hurting or struggling or suffering. So, when you create a story in your mind about them succeeding and doing better (i.e. an expectation) you feel a little better.\n\nThe problem is, you can’t actually control other people, even for the better. Not nearly as much as you would like, anyway. Which means you create a constant vicious cycle of sky-high hopes and grave disappointments and frustrations.\n\nWhat’s more, eventually your attempts at control begin to be felt by the people in your life and they become resentful. And if it goes on long enough, they may even act contrary to your expectations simply out of spite!\n\nThe solution is to let go of your expectations. Stop creating stories about what you want for other people. And instead, just be present for the person they are:\n\nValidate their current struggles instead of daydreaming about their future successes.\nSet real boundaries on their behavior instead of wishing for perfection.\nMeet them where they are instead of where you want them to be.\nHang on to your hopes but let go of your expectations.\n\n“He was swimming in a sea of other people’s expectations. Men had drowned in seas like that.”\n\n― Robert Jordan", "timestamp": 1654771503, "digest": "Xs8sUODUbrLN6RXf8VYOBYqvhJtDBZth_eJRCw1FlLs", "contributor": "0xd25891CfAF13C9Ca8a102709261Da2fFd0Fb0a1F"}

All fees, collected to a protocol, as well as any interest earned through staking USDN that serves as collateral on Tsunami will be distributed between **TSN** stakers.\n\n### Overall terms\n\nAs a crypto enthusiasts and investors, we highly appreciate fairness and transparency during token offerings. In line with our values, we’re offering **TSN** tokens under a ‘Fair Launch’ model. Fair launch means that any participants may participate in the even on equal terms. Tsunami have not attracted any VC capital and had no private round prior to ILO phase.\n\nFurthermore, Tsunami team has decided to ***lock ALL team tokens*** in contract, with a cliff period of 6 months and a vesting period of 24 months. This way, we minimize the possibility of downwards price pressure after launch. Additionally, in this bear market, we’ve decided to ***reduce initial price*** per token to 0.2 USDN which means an initial market cap of 200,000 USDN.\n\n### ILO Process\n\nInitial Liquidity Offering (ILO) - is a new fundraising mechanism through which many projects and startups raise funds by selling tokens on the DeFi based Decentralized Exchanges (DEX’s). During ILO, team will stake own capital to provide initial liquidity to DEX (Puzzle Swap) to bootstrap liquidity. All tokens will immediately be put to circulation, reducing the possibility of price manipulations by large holders.\n\nTo put things simply, we will create trading pair (liquidity pool) on Puzzle Swap, provide 60% of **TSN** total supply to liquidity pool, along with enough USDN to make **TSN** price on exchange 0.2 USDN.\n\nAfters this process, everyone will have a change to buy **TSN** at minimum price - no external manipulation is allowed. Of course, as per AMM formula - the more tokens get bought, the higher the price - so be quick and try to jump in as soon as possible! You may also sell your tokens as soon as you wish, all tokens are immediately fully liquid.\n\nAfter an ILO team may withdraw some liquidity from the pool to finance future development. Also note, that the airdrop to the testnet users will take place in 3 days after beginning of ILO.\n\nWe will announce an exact date of ILO later, after finishing Testnet phase.\n\n### ILO Platform\n\nOur strategic partner for ILO is [Puzzle Swap](https://puzzle.surf/). Puzzle Swap is the most innovative decentralized exchange on Waves, offering many features to make ILO successful.\n\nAfter an ILO team will concentrate all resources on moving on with project roadmap. This includes, most importantly, mainnet launch. After launching mainnet we will introduce staking, that will allow users to stake their **TSN** tokens and earn rewards.

This was a very cool exploration in digital production, and left us feeling like we had just been \"on set\" for one month:) I want to go through some of the details of the project in this article, as I think it will be interesting to those with eyes on the metaverse!\n\n## THE METAHUMAN\n\nOur drive to start this project actually emerged from an introduction to the Metahuman software for Unreal Engine 5. I had seen the amazing advances in Unreal Engine over the last few years, but could not convince myself to learn this beast of a program until I saw THE METAHUMANS. [Metahuman Creator](https://metahuman.unrealengine.com/) is a web app that allows you to create and customize an avatar. During this process, the app streams to you a video feed in order to avoid any client side render costs. When you are ready, you can export and load all the textures / models / shaders / blueprints for a functional metahuman in Unreal Engine.\n\nIt’s very mesmerizing to use this tool, blending between different faces and sculpting the face and textures to your taste. It’s really hard to look away from her, watching her animate shyly, looking at me, looking away…\n\n![Our attempt at recreating Kiki Yago](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XGvJwB99xKudY-U5pdinX.png?height=949&width=1471)\n\nWe did the first pass at recreating [Kiki Yago](https://www.instagram.com/xenofontova_dasha/) - we found this task quite challenging, as the tool always seemed to clamp the features we wanted to sculpt, for example we could not find a way to get the avatars eyes to be wider apart. Anyway, we sent this draft to Kiki and she said that it was cool but definitely did not look like her, and that she would give it a try.\n\n![Kiki's self exploration](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hgog_0pOJwUk4iYpT7z_q.png?height=672&width=1843)\n\nI was skeptical that it would be possible to create an avatar that looks like yourself, since we all have some sort of self perception deficiencies and biases… but I was proven wrong! Kiki’s versions capture the essence of her facial features way better than ours, even with our restrictions that she must be bald:)\n\nI am very curious now to create my own avatar, and think it could be a cool exercise in self perception for all of us, since it’s the first avatar creator that can actually photo-realistically look like you, but do you even think you look like you?:0\n\n## FACIAL CAPTURE\n\nThe goal was to get Kiki to sing and record her facial capture for the entire song, keeping in mind that Kiki was in Saint Petersburg / Russia , and we were in San Francisco / USA. We decided on using the [FaceCap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/face-cap-motion-capture/id1373155478) application, since our friend used it for her [Little Martian](https://www.littlemartians.world/) project and had promising results, and all it needed was an iPhone 10 or above! Kiki downloaded it on her iPhone, and could send us the FBX over telegram!\n\nIt’s amazing with the technologies that we have today and the power of virtual production, we were able to come up with a face capture solution that did not require any studio equipment or even being in the same country!\n\nKiki sent us some short initial test recordings, and we spent a few days struggling through the technical details of getting the animation to map to the Metahuman facial rig -- this was mostly due to the fact that it was our first time using Unreal Engine for.. anything, and also that Unreal Engine completely changed their animation retargeting system in UE5.\n\nHowever, thanks to watching this video, its beautiful elevator soundtrack, and the [FaceCap morph target re-mapping data](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbExnbUJBOV9KcEFLRGFadlZKN2lJSWt0QnR2UXxBQ3Jtc0trODRlRHZZdHNQdzVTM2hRS0xwS0p5VnhyNkRYX0NjTk5QYWxHeTUzRU4xT3M1MGd5d2pkazluZHlMUkhhX25FU0dzcGd3OVo2UGR0ekphS2JPZVpRdkxRYzc5WHhSWHNZZmNuaFpPQ1dGSmVJQ0lFaw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fdrive%2Ffolders%2F1YHd5_ASl-KAS2e_k9h-CIwXIkAUMtSM0%3Fusp%3Dsharing&v=xixo8ljv9_8) that the author generously shared, we were able to get an initial working demo!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xixo8ljv9_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xixo8ljv9_8)\n\n[https://codercat.tk/facecap_testing.mp4?autoplay=true&loop=true&controls=true](https://codercat.tk/facecap_testing.mp4?autoplay=true&loop=true&controls=true)\n\nThis was super promising! Meta Kiki was alive! But obviously there was a lot of work to be done on adjusting the remapping of FaceCap to Metahuman Rig, specifically in the mouth and jaw area.\n\nWe asked Kiki to send us the FaceCap FBX along with a recording of herself from a separate camera and a WAV file, on Telegram, our Remote Face Capture Studio. This was a complete picture of the data, so that we had reference videos while adjusting the Metahuman facial rig remapping, and reference audio for aligning the face capture to the main audio track.\n\n![Telegram, the Remote Face Capture Studio](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-OtogUwkbFNt_BhvRJdMs.png?height=591&width=884)\n\n![Quick sassy capture of Kiki ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z7diXiBgxCo0ICpzEO1di.jpg?height=473&width=1280)\n\nAfter we got a good pipeline going, we could focus on ways to improve the overall effect of the face capture. We found that eye acting and head rotations came across really well and was a good place to focus the performance efforts. It was also critical to over articulate words and press lips together, which was actually a difficult task for this song where Kiki is pushing her lyrical alliterations at 100 words/second:)\n\nKiki pushed forward on this, coming up with some crazy fast eye blinking action and creepy doll expressions. She split the song into 12 sections of around 20 seconds each, because we found that smaller recordings were much easier to process in Unreal Engine.\n\n## TO BE CONTINUED\n\nOnce we were confident in our Face Capture remote pipeline, we moved on to the environment design and visual effects! This is a big and slightly unrelated topic since most of this work was done in HoudiniFX -- so i’m going to split that into another article:) \n\n![MSPaint Concept Art](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CcybeAZmnYpnXVkr-mTd0.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe are really excited about this technology, and to take this whole experience to the next level. Since the metahumans are so realistic, we definitely need to put some work into the 3D environment, shader, and geometry styles that are harmonious. This will be an exploration that i’m very looking forward to, with some shorter concept video renders. \n\n<3 [CODERCAT](https://codercat.tk)", "timestamp": 1654771650, "digest": "sOdxVpJEcC3N_hlytcg6cg_ApjrfLTc2eOW_TU7rcKg", "contributor": "0xf366Febe12995E7980248430b49331c54447F438"}

In addition, we’ll be using [Chainlink Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF)](https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-functions-vrf-random-number-generation-rng-feature/) to introduce provably fair random elements into the Axie universe, starting first with Axie Origin Coins (AOC).\n\n**What is Chainlink?**\n\nChainlink is the market-leading decentralized oracle network providing **real-world data to smart contracts on any blockchain**. It allows dApps like Axie Infinity to consume data from outside the Blockchain, such as data from web APIs, premium data providers, IoT networks, enterprise backends, and more.\n\n**What is Axie Infinity?**\n\nAxies are fierce creatures that love to battle, build, and hunt for treasure!\n\n‌Players can build up a collection of Axies and use them across an ever expanding universe of games!\n\nAxie Infinity is currently the #1 game on Ethereum, with over 14,000 monthly on-chain users, and over 11,000 daily off-chain users.\n\nWe recently launched our[ native token, AXS](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/axs), which uses governance and fee sharing to align incentives between all members of the Axie ecosystem.\n\nWant to learn more? [Join Axie Discord](http://discord.gg/axie) to meet our amazing community!\n\n# Integration details\n\nAs the first step in our collaboration, Axie has integrated the [Chainlink ETH/USD Price Reference Data](https://feeds.chain.link/eth-usd) feed into our [marketplace](http://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/). This price feed serves as a very important exchange rate to ensure that marketplace users have accurate prices when making a purchasing and listing decision. In addition, mainstream users find USD price feeds more familiar so its important for adoption that we get this right.\n\nCurrently, we’re getting our price feeds from centralized servers which can go down and be disrupted. With Chainlink price feeds, we can ensure 100% uptime for our marketplace’s all-important ETH/USD price feed. We feel confident integrating this key exchange rate via Chainlink because it’s secured by a decentralized network of high-quality oracle nodes that provide accurate price data sourced from a variety of excellent off-chain data aggregators.\n\nIn addition, we’ll be using Chainlink VRF for the generation of Origin Axies from Axie Origin Coins (AOC)! The number of Origin Axies in the game is capped at 4088. Each time 5 AOC are burned, an Origin Axie is born with a chance of possessing[ Mystic parts.](https://medium.com/axie-infinity/mystic-axies-jewels-for-adigital-age-4dd1b599ca61) The chance of an Axie possessing Mystic parts when they’re born from AOC will soon rely on the VRF!\n\nThis is an incredibly important task considering the scarcity of Mystic Axies is central to their value. In fact, a Mystic Axie just sold for 300 ETH and the event was covered by [CoinTelegraph!](https://cointelegraph.com/news/300-eth-sale-caps-wild-week-for-axie-infinity) Talk about famous digital pets.\n\nWe selected Chainlink VRF because it provides a highly secure source of randomness that is permissionless and auditable on-chain by all users. This provides users with cryptographic proof that all random elements are provably fair, and cannot be manipulated by our team or any external entities.\n\n**The Future of Axie Infinity and Chainlink**\n\nOnce Ronin, our Ethereum sidechain, is live, we’ll explore integrating Chainlink VRF functionality into more Axie-related smart contracts.\n\nChainlink also makes a host of fun features possible because it provides access to any off-chain API. We believe we have only scratched the surface in how external data can be incorporated in Axie to enhance gameplay and the user experience.\n\nFinally, we’d like to formally invite the Chainlink Marines to start playing Axie! Special thanks to [@ChainlinkGod](https://twitter.com/ChainLinkGod) for his work educating us on the benefits of integrating Chainlink feeds into our ecosystem!", "timestamp": 1654771720, "digest": "il6rJ71QgZ265fXgFB94WGAUw7EJBhODLt5L2viw8lU", "contributor": "0xd25891CfAF13C9Ca8a102709261Da2fFd0Fb0a1F"}

[@Zoezoe888zoe](https://twitter.com/Zoezoe888zoe) [@WhoKnowsDAO](https://twitter.com/WhoKnowsDAO)\n\n本期文字稿精选了6个 Space 中的精彩提问。\n\n编辑：三斤妹妹、定慧\n\n## 什么是 Social Fi ？为什么要 Fi 化那些资产？是否是伪命题？\n\n**pengsong：**\n\nSocial fi 与 Web2 最大的不同是：\n\n能够定义你社交关系的价值，并将其资产化、金融化。\n\n并且对个人（地址）进行赋能。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n**socialfi= social+fi**，是由 defi 到 gamefi 再到 socialfi 逐步演进的。**social 所涉及的人的广泛程度是最大的。**\n\n我认为 socailfi 的本质是通过 web3 的理念改变以往社交产品中的价值分配，让 web2 里别扭的地方通过激励系统的重新调配，去高效地完成供给层和需求平台在 social 层面上的交易撮合。\n\n但我觉得 social fi 是不是伪命题还需要靠验证。\n\nsocialfi 是目前所有“xfi”中唯一没有杀手级应用的词。从17、18年的尝试至今都没有跑出来一个真正有PMF的产品，因此我认为它是一个待被定义的词，如果长时间不被定义，这个词就会慢慢死掉，换做其他。当然这个问题背后的根本还是 web3 是不是完全的fi。\n\n**林川：**\n\n**social fi 更合适的称呼应该为“web3社交平台”**，虽然目前没有一个确切的定义，但我可以讲讲它不是什么。\n\n首先 social fi 不是 web2 社交产品的简单复刻；其次也不是 social to earn。\n\nsocial to earn的 主要问题在于奖惩激励很难明确化，很难防止用户互刷，产品本身的定位也会模糊掉。\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\nSocialfi 的核心是fi，token 和 NFT 所提供的金融和资产的工具让 web3 的社交产品对于价值分配和冷启动方面有更多可用的东西，至于重构好的产品是什么样的，目前还看不清楚。\n\n一直拘泥于 x to earn 的模式里很难逃脱旁氏的魔咒。因为金融化未必能给到用户最想要的东西，用户追求的主要功能还是交友、date、沟通与链接，金钱的过分加持会让人贪婪，不管是对单纯的用户也好还是在app里以挣钱为目的的一部分人。\n\n## Web2 领域有哪些可以借鉴的地方？\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n首先需要去理清产品的定位，即“社交”指的是什么？\n\n社交本身是一个被宽泛使用的概念，实际上在产品定位的坐标轴上是有不同程度和不同定位的，按照关系链强弱和内容占比，可以分为：\n\n**1.通信通讯类**\n\n**2.交友匹配类** (dating app / social network）\n\n**3.UGC社区类产品**\n\n**4.社交媒体**\n\n四种的产品的形态、设计重点、交付给用户的核心价值不同。\n\nSocialfi 中 fi 的概念可能是指：\n\n我们如何通过 token 的模型&方式，去重新做社交中的用户激励与利益分配？\n\n利益分配不止赚钱，例如 Dating APP 的匹配。\n\n至于 socialfi 里面的去中心化比重有多少，我认为可能没有办法做到全部环节的去中心化。\n\n比如说账号的新旧数据是用户自有的，无论是自己发的 UGC 内容还是新产生的社交图谱、关系链中的数据用户都可以自由处理与转移，这是去中心化的体现。但是最后很多环节可能避免不了要中心化，比如对于传统社交媒体和社交软件来说，它的一些核心能力与价值是掌握在平台当中的。\n\n比如对于dating app 来说核心是匹配算法，用户之间的匹配很难做到去中心化，因为会导致社交效率极低下。所以社交追求的是两件事，一个是找到的用户质量足够高，另一个是匹配精准用户的效率足够高。\n\n结合上面两点来看，我认为web3如果要将 social 和 fi 结合好，**用户质量、用户获得感、用户参与感、用户对资产的拥有和处理，**这些更偏质量的东西可能是优化的重点，而一些本身特别追求用户连接效率的社交模式不太适合做区块链的改造。\n\n## 目前对Web2社交产品的批评集中在哪些方面？Web3用户期待什么样的新社交产品？\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n如果是复刻 Web2 的产品。本身没有太大意义，因为对于用户来说除了有 token 可以挣以外并没有特别的价值。\n\n**而 token 本身的金融属性提供了很好的项目初期冷启动工具**，对前期圈一波用户有很大的帮助。比如说 Open DAO 和礼物空投 group，很可惜这两个项目后面没有能让用户留下来的产品。\n\n我体验过很多复刻，但是效果都不好。\n\n我认为从产品开发的角度讲应当跳开已有概念框架的约束去思考目前web3用户群体最大的痛点是什么，再根据痛点去找合适的产品方向。至少我发现很多人体感 discord 难用，以及安全事件屡屡发生，是否可以开发出一款专门针对 web3 用户的类 discord 通讯工具去解决用户最大的痛点与需求？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前对 web2 社交产品的批评更多集中在中心化和数据资产的所有权上，在国内这个问题不是用户直接体验到的。\n\n对于 web3 产品的新需求大家集中在社群的交流和管理的需求层面，因为目前还是用 web2 的产品discord 和 telegram 来代替的，它们毕竟不是原生的 web3 产品，各自都有一些问题。因此新的 web3产品需要瞄准用户的新需求与痛点，我赞同麻辣烫老师的观点去做 discord 的替代品，是具有一定的前景的。\n\n**陈不斯：**\n\n1\\.针对麻辣烫老师提出的痛点问题，人是否真的需要单独的社交产品？\n\nNot Boring 认为NFT是一种新型社交网络，因此是否需要一个单独平台去服务和承载是一个值得探索的思考的问题。\n\n2\\.如果社交产品是成立的，同时web3的金融属性不可避免，是否可以考虑本身就有一些经济属性或者逐利属性的社交行为？参考web2产品里的社交行为去用token经济模型改造。\n\n3\\.如果web3的金融属性可以被抛弃，发展到了用户足够大、圈层足够广泛和多样的时候，是否会跟web2产品遵循同样的方法论？“为工具而来，为网络而留”\n\nweb3相比web2来说最大的优势是互通性，代表用户的安全、隐私问题，给予用户足够的自主权，但是整体上面临的最大问题还是没有找到核心痛点让用户有动力从web2社交产品迁移到web3中去。\n\n**wegger：**\n\n很多赛道都在做socialfi的产品，发现了有以下特点：\n\n1\\.有门槛，通过爱好或者资产进行过滤。人们会偏好于小众社交，对身份的认同感在小圈子里支撑起来。\n\n2\\.socialfi在隐私领域的运营场景。\n\n3\\.技术差距不大，更倾向于思维和圈子层次的小众化，往小而精的方向发展。\n\n**taosha：**\n\nMake sense的场景：用户的数据算有权。不用证明自己做了什么事情，直接在链上数据可以看到相关资质。\n\n在招聘场景里，文凭可以作为一个 soulbound token（灵魂绑定代币），并绑定在一个作为 soul 的 did 上，不管是做 web3 领英或相亲平台，都可以从 did 的 soulbound token 中读取到我对文凭获得证明。\n\n对于项目来说，web3最大的红利是拉新获客很简单。过去我们需要在抖音、百度上买广告，而现在可以去扫描谁持有 BAYC (无聊猿)，就知道他很有钱，可以给他的地址空投一个 NFT 推销产品。\n\n在链上target用户较为精准和方便，更好地服务用户。\n\n**zoey：**\n\n思考两个问题：为了什么要做？为了谁去做？\n\nweb3 的价值定义：\n\n**1.让价值回归个体**\n\n**2.增强每个个体之间的情感链接**\n\n**3.不被平台控制的个人身份**\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n## 协议 vs 应用，对两个不同方向有什么看法？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前发展形态上是产品和协议之争。\n\n如果短期出现一个比较火的 web3 的社交产品做出圈的话，需要非常强的运营能力，单纯靠协议很难。长期看web3本身的基建更适合做重协议、轻应用的形态。\n\n大家更愿意接受社交关系和身份绑定，应用只调用社交关系，而不是到哪个产品都要再跑一遍社交关系。\n\n我长期更看好协议的发展，短期能出圈的可能还是重产品、重运营的一些社交应用。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n协议需要有用户共识，而 Social 更是直接对接终端用户\n\nSocial layer 的协议，应基于杀手级应用而诞生。\n\n因为协议是制定被大家所使用的规则，杀手级应用能为规则带来共识。\n\n特别是【社交图谱】，用户必须知道这个网友我是怎么认识的，就非常看重应用场景。所以如果要做社交图谱的协议，一定要从自带场景的 APP 起步。\n\n像 super connect 这样的项目没有这么做，我不是很能理解。\n\n**林川：**\n\nsuper connect 如果要出圈，应该会是各种想做社交的应用发现调用 super connect 这个协议会很方便，能给自己加一层社交关系，从而逐渐产生跟风效应火起来。\n\n**pengsong：**\n\n如何将 social 的记录从应用的中心化存储状态放上链，NFT可能是一个很好的选择。通过钱包地址中记录着社交关系的NFT 配合协议实现社交关系上链。\n\n但目前这个领域大家围绕 social 更多是 token 的这种经济设计，NFT 的底子比较薄弱，可能还需要半年一年的时间发展。\n\n思想转变：\n\n❌ Token 经济模型\n\n❌ 中心化数据库\n\n✅ NFT 关系网络\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n站在产业格局的角度，虽然区块链是“胖协议，瘦应用”\n\n但当A16z 对 web3 概念的炒作，其实这个概念背后蕴含着将 Web3 推广给更多用户的期待。\n\n更多的应用场景带来的不仅是对整个行业发展的促进，也意味着行业上下游的竞争。例如协议下场做应用，或应用上升做协议。\n\n因此未来可能是 **“胖协议，胖应用”** 的状态。\n\nSocial 协议提供的核心价值是什么？\n\n* 如果是数据（关系链、用户身份等），则会受应用层牵制，需要等待应用的发展与积累。难以像其它协议一样通过开发者快速迭代升级\n* 如果是技术，目前社交产品的开发门槛比较低，更看重运营，协议可能无法提供足够的价值。\n\n提升价值的建议：【数据】+【技术创新】+【增值服务】\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n## 如果是杀手级应用来开发协议的话，这个应用是否可能是由 Web2 的老家伙搞出来的？\n\n或者干脆是把 Web2 产品改造而来，例如马斯克改造推特的可能？\n\n如果说，推特能被马斯克私有化，不再服务于股东利益，通过把底层协议和用户关系贡献出来，将自己的平台价值颠覆掉，转型成一个社交公链，想象空间就太大了。\n\n而且对于web2巨头自我革命，恐怕只有马斯克有机会做到了\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\n反对，推特这样的巨鳄自我革命太难。\n\n更可能的路径是这样的：\n\n目前围绕各个公链，已经基于交易，形成了经济关系网络，而社区中空。\n\n（例如以太坊网络中60-70%的地址都在 Defi 热潮中参与了进来。但没有产品去承载这种社交关系）\n\n因此，围绕公链做社区才是方向。因为只要公链不死，关系网络就在。\n\n这是我看好的 Social fi 机会。\n\n**Eric：**\n\n看好 Web2 巨头带着自身存量转入 Web3\n\n因为网络效应太重，哪怕开发者达成共识追求理想，但难以与用户达成共识。\n\n可能只有用户的无感知迁移才行得通。\n\n**BillyWen：**\n\n曾经电报、电话时代，协议都是通的。例如你可以随时给美国朋友打电话。\n\nIM 即时通讯时代来临后，才出现应用层建墙圈用户，为了自身获利。\n\n目前 Web3 实现了货币和金融的无边界，相信未来的 web3 Social 一样没有边界。\n\n商业公司改革的确很困难，因为要追求利润。\n\n但未来10年如果有人站出来，做出了打破边界的 Social 变革，我相信他会被载入史册。\n\n**Beagle Dao：**\nWeb3 Social 有四个方面\n\n1. **基础设施、协议**\n   1. 例如 ENS 解决了钱包和名字的问题，通过 ENS 的身份社交，而非钱包地址。\n2. **社交凭证**\n   1. 例如 POAP，通过 NFT 证明你在哪里做过什么事\n3. **社交关系、社交图谱**\n4. **工具**\n   1. 【语音】例如：Clubhouse 、Twitter space\n   2. 【信息】例如：微信、邮件\n   3. 【内容】例如：推特、FB\n\n语音比较难做。\n\n信息类工具很多人在做，迁移成本高，平台不互动。\n\n可能需要大佬入场，强制或用更高的势能带动更多人加入\n\n因为 Web3 的社交关系都存在链上，所以不会像 Web2 那样重平台。\n\n更可能是共创式，每个人都做一点，拼成整个 Web3 社交的生态。\n\n观点：**Web3 社交会从B端生长出来。**\n\n对于C端而言，Web2 已经有足够好的产品了。\n\n更大的可能性是开发B端有普遍需求的工具&协议，因为B端自己懒的做而被广泛调用，因而普及。\n\n## Web2 是邪恶的吗？\n\n**Eric：**\n\n我并不认为web2 邪恶，至少有游戏规则\n\nweb2 榨取用户价值、用户体验受损的的矛盾会持续存在，但也与现在的资本市场玩法息息相关。例如开放平台都会缩回去，因为平台感觉自己把有价值的东西送出去，但却无法满足金主爸爸的期待。\n\n这种恶是人性的恶。只要 Web3 是人做的，我想一样会面对。\n\n**web3 的核心是改变价值体系，基于token 经济让系统中的各个角色都开心。**\n\n但从金融层面，怎么玩都是零和游戏。打破很难。\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n区块链不能解决人性的问题，从终局来看我会悲观，未来可能会出来新的不正义和垄断。\n\n而此刻他正在追求更公平，找到新的解决方案，这是我欣赏的。\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\nWeb3 的社交可能会更邪恶。\n\n当一个人的身份可以被 NFT 等链上方式充分定义，很多社交圈层将很容易通过技术建立门槛。你可能无法再通过找关系就加入一个大佬们会讨论问题的微信群、获得资源。可能因为你没进圈子，连吃瓜的资格都没有。\n\n但相应的，web2 当中很难走上颠覆（头部效应），在web3当中，你的努力更容易实现成功。\n\n**Red_Phoenix:**\n\n任何一个行业都有其宿命，都有其黑暗和光明。\n\n例如 Web2 的公司就一定会走向垄断和盈利，**而 Social 在 Web3 中的使命，可能是构建一个国家**，有自己共识、金融和分配方式。特别是当区块链的信用、生产力与线下产生链接时，就非常有想象力。\n\n——————————————\n\nWhoKnows DAO 将持续为大家组织优质的 Space、专题研究活动。\n\n如果你希望基于 Social fi

{"id": "LaWmTFChk4YJYRlpEDg9c_OYjqtQQqwXFu9oAJgI0P8", "title": "20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In Life", "body": "Life is a journey of twists and turns, peaks and valleys, mountains to climb and oceans to explore.\n\nGood times and bad times. Happy times and sad times.\n\nBut always, life is a movement forward.\nNo matter where you are on the journey, in some way, you are continuing on — and that’s what makes it so magnificent. One day, you’re questioning what on earth will ever make you feel happy and fulfilled. And the next, you’re perfectly in flow, writing the most important book of your entire career.\n\nWhat nobody ever tells you, though, when you are a wide-eyed child, are all the little things that come along with “growing up.”\n\n1. Most people are scared of using their imagination.\n   They’ve disconnected with their inner child.\n\nThey don’t feel they are “creative.”\n\nThey like things “just the way they are.”\n\n1. Your dream doesn’t really matter to anyone else.\n   Some people might take interest. Some may support you in your quest. But at the end of the day, nobody cares, or will ever care about your dream as much as you.\n2. Friends are relative to where you are in your life.\n   Most friends only stay for a period of time — usually in reference to your current interest. But when you move on, or your priorities change, so too do the majority of your friends.\n3. Your potential increases with age.\n   As people get older, they tend to think that they can do less and less — when in reality, they should be able to do more and more, because they have had time to soak up more knowledge. Being great at something is a daily habit. You aren’t just “born” that way.\n4. Spontaneity is the sister of creativity.\n   If all you do is follow the exact same routine every day, you will never leave yourself open to moments of sudden discovery. Do you remember how spontaneous you were as a child? Anything could happen, at any moment!\n5. You forget the value of “touch” later on.\n   When was the last time you played in the rain?\n\nWhen was the last time you sat on a sidewalk and looked closely at the cracks, the rocks, the dirt, the one weed growing between the concrete and the grass nearby.\n\nDo that again.\n\nYou will feel so connected to the playfulness of life.\n\n1. Most people don’t do what they love.\n   It’s true.\n\nThe “masses” are not the ones who live the lives they dreamed of living. And the reason is because they didn’t fight hard enough. They didn’t make it happen for themselves. And the older you get, and the more you look around, the easier it becomes to believe that you’ll end up the same.\n\nDon’t fall for the trap.\n\n1. Many stop reading after college.\n   Ask anyone you know the last good book they read, and I’ll bet most of them respond with, “Wow, I haven’t read a book in a long time.”\n2. People talk more than they listen.\n   There is nothing more ridiculous to me than hearing two people talk “at” each other, neither one listening, but waiting for the other person to stop talking so they can start up again.\n3. Creativity takes practice.\n   It’s funny how much we as a society praise and value creativity, and yet seem to do as much as we can to prohibit and control creative expression unless it is in some way profitable.\n\nIf you want to keep your creative muscle pumped and active, you have to practice it on your own.\n\n1. “Success” is a relative term.\n   As kids, we’re taught to “reach for success.”\n\nWhat does that really mean? Success to one person could mean the opposite for someone else.\n\nDefine your own Success.\n\n1. You can’t change your parents.\n   A sad and difficult truth to face as you get older: You can’t change your parents.\n\nThey are who they are.\n\nWhether they approve of what you do or not, at some point, no longer matters. Love them for bringing you into this world, and leave the rest at the door.\n\n1. The only person you have to face in the morning is yourself.\n   When you’re younger, it feels like you have to please the entire world.\n\nYou don’t.\n\nDo what makes you happy, and create the life you want to live for yourself. You’ll see someone you truly love staring back at you every morning if you can do that.\n\n1. Nothing feels as good as something you do from the heart.\n   No amount of money or achievement or external validation will ever take the place of what you do out of pure love.\n\nFollow your heart, and the rest will follow.\n\n1. Your potential is directly correlated to how well you know yourself.\n   Those who know themselves and maximize their strengths are the ones who go where they want to go.\n\nThose who don’t know themselves, and avoid the hard work of looking inward, live life by default. They lack the ability to create for themselves their own future.\n\n1. Everyone who doubts you will always come back around.\n   That kid who used to bully you will come asking for a job.\n\nThe girl who didn’t want to date you will call you back once she sees where you’re headed. It always happens that way.\n\nJust focus on you, stay true to what you believe in, and all the doubters will eventually come asking for help.\n\n1. You are a reflection of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\n   Nobody creates themselves, by themselves.\n\nWe are all mirror images, sculpted through the reflections we see in other people. This isn’t a game you play by yourself. Work to be surrounded by those you wish to be like, and in time, you too will carry the very things you admire in them.\n\n1. Beliefs are relative to what you pursue.\n   Wherever you are in life, and based on who is around you, and based on your current aspirations, those are the things that shape your beliefs.\n\nNobody explains, though, that “beliefs” then are not “fixed.” There is no “right and wrong.” It is all relative.\n\nFind what works for you.\n\n1. Anything can be a vice.\n   Be wary.\n\nAgain, there is no “right” and “wrong” as you get older. A coping mechanism to one could be a way to relax on a Sunday to another. Just remain aware of your habits and how you spend your time, and what habits start to increase in frequency — and then question where they are coming from in you and why you feel compelled to repeat them.\n\nNever mistakes, always lessons.\n\nAs I said, know yourself.\n\n1. Your purpose is to be YOU.\n   What is the meaning of life?\n\nTo be you, all of you, always, in everything you do — whatever that means to you. You are your own creator. You are your own evolving masterpiece.\n\nGrowing up is the realization that you are both the sculpture and the sculptor, the painter and the portrait.

{"id": "2mutPMqT0IjW4WDiZvkPXvxgCOT4lUMAL6qRINa3ma0", "title": "How I replicated an $86 million project in 57 lines of code\n", "body": "## When an experiment with existing open source technology does a “good enough” job\n\n \n The Victoria Police are the primary law enforcement agency of Victoria, Australia. With over 16,000 vehicles stolen in Victoria this past year — at a cost of about $170 million — the police department is experimenting with a variety of technology-driven solutions to crackdown on car theft. They call this system BlueNet.\n\nTo help prevent fraudulent sales of stolen vehicles, there is already a VicRoads [web-based service](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/registration/buy-sell-or-transfer-a-vehicle/buy-a-vehicle/check-vehicle-registration/vehicle-registration-enquiry) for checking the status of vehicle registrations. The department has also invested in a stationary license plate scanner — a fixed tripod camera which scans passing traffic to automatically identify stolen vehicles.\n\nDon’t ask me why, but one afternoon I had the desire to prototype a vehicle-mounted license plate scanner that would automatically notify you if a vehicle had been stolen or was unregistered. Understanding that these individual components existed, I wondered how difficult it would be to wire them together.\n\nBut it was after a bit of googling that I discovered the Victoria Police had recently undergone a trial of a similar device, and the estimated cost of roll out was somewhere in the vicinity of $86,000,000. One astute commenter pointed out that the $86M cost to fit out 220 vehicles comes in at a rather thirsty **$390,909 per vehicle**.\n\nSurely we can do a bit better than that.\n\n# The Success Criteria\n\nBefore getting started, I outlined a few key requirements for product design.\n\n## Requirement #1: The image processing must be performed locally\n\nStreaming live video to a central processing warehouse seemed the least efficient approach to solving this problem. Besides the whopping bill for data traffic, you’re also introducing network latency into a process which may already be quite slow.\n\nAlthough a centralized machine learning algorithm is only going to get more accurate over time, I wanted to learn if an local on-device implementation would be “good enough”.\n\n## Requirement #2: It must work with low quality images\n\nSince I don’t have a Raspberry Pi camera or USB webcam, so I’ll be using dashcam footage — it’s readily available and an ideal source of sample data. As an added bonus, dashcam video represents the overall quality of footage you’d expect from vehicle mounted cameras.\n\n## Requirement #3: It needs to be built using open source technology\n\nRelying upon a proprietary software means you’ll get stung every time you request a change or enhancement — and the stinging will continue for every request made thereafter. Using open source technology is a no-brainer.\n\n# My solution\n\nAt a high level, my solution takes an image from a dashcam video, pumps it through an open source license plate recognition system installed locally on the device, queries the registration check service, and then returns the results for display.\n\nThe data returned to the device installed in the law enforcement vehicle includes the vehicle’s make and model (which it only uses to verify whether the plates have been stolen), the registration status, and any notifications of the vehicle being reported stolen.\n\nIf that sounds rather simple, it’s because it really is. For example, the image processing can all be handled by the *openalpr* library.\n\nThis is really all that’s involved to recognize the characters on a license plate:\n\nI must say I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI expected the open source license plate recognition to be pretty rubbish. Additionally, the image recognition algorithms are probably not optimised for Australian license plates.\n\nThe solution was able to recognise license plates in a wide field of view.Although, the solution would occasionally have issues with particular letters.\n\n \n But … the solution would eventually get them correct.\n\n \n As you can see in the above two images, processing the image a couple of frames later jumped from a confidence rating of 87% to a hair over 91%.\n\nI’m confident, pardon the pun, that the accuracy could be improved by increasing the sample rate, and then sorting by the highest confidence rating. Alternatively a threshold could be set that only accepts a confidence of greater than 90% before going on to validate the registration number.\n\nThose are very straight forward code-first fixes, and don’t preclude the training of the license plate recognition software with a local data set.\n\n## The $86,000,000 Question\n\nTo be fair, I have absolutely no clue what the $86M figure includes — nor can I speak to the accuracy of my open source tool with no localized training vs. the pilot BlueNet system.\n\nI would expect part of that budget includes the replacement of several legacy databases and software applications to support the high frequency, low latency querying of license plates several times per second, per vehicle.\n\nOn the other hand, the cost of \\~$391k per vehicle seems pretty rich — especially if the BlueNet isn’t particularly accurate and there are no large scale IT projects to decommission or upgrade dependent systems.\n\n## Future Applications\n\nWhile it’s easy to get caught up in the Orwellian nature of an “always on” network of license plate snitchers, there are many positive applications of this technology. Imagine a passive system scanning fellow motorists for an abductors car that automatically alerts authorities and family members to their current location and direction.\n\nTeslas vehicles are already brimming with cameras and sensors with the ability to receive OTA updates — imagine turning these into a fleet of virtual good samaritans. Ubers and Lyft drivers could also be outfitted with these devices to dramatically increase the coverage area.\n\nUsing open source technology and existing components, it seems possible to offer a solution that provides a much higher rate of return — for an investment much less than $86M.", "timestamp": 1654772697, "digest": "3tEFDlgX4y5js5Pu8pDCPBTODxICvFWHhZXyz-8sD_c", "contributor": "0x5C29e2143A07f0B20a5881e1A353F95140c73D83"}

{"id": "1h_eEeU2M7Tuln1_pJ-vokb-p7xnh3G3tYCA6wGrnF8", "title": "2022交互指南(更新至20220609)", "body": "![head](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ICBCuq-KMqP3owGdSoAeT.png?height=200&width=600)\n\n## 前言\n\n先给大家讲一下我写这篇文章的心路历程和初衷，如果觉得废话或是说理念不一致的就直接跳过看项目或者无视吧，我也不是什么大佬，主要就是把自己这么长时间做过的事情整理了出来，$ENS、$DYDX、$GAL、$OP、$HOP这些我也有幸拿到。这里说一下我个人其实最多交互不超过5个号，大部分项目不超过3个甚至主要的就1个，这种确实不可能一波暴富，但我更喜欢真实去体验一些生态项目而不是单纯做交互撸空投，多个号刚开始主要目的也是希望把资金分开不想放在一个钱包，希望把号的质量做起来，再者动不动几十上百个我精力也顶不住，曾经撸交互也学习过一些类似脚本模拟操作、web3js批量自动化合约调用，但个人精力实在是不足，有时候还挺枯燥的，我也建议大部分朋友从做一个精品号开始，贪多嚼不烂而且现在空投标准也提高了，十个白号加起来有时候还没一个精品号数量多。这里就是希望将一些自己的经验分享给大家，还希望多多包涵。我在整个加密圈前前后后断断续续其实也有4、5年了，但前半段时间其实对于很多事情的认识和认知都不到位，直到后来下定决心把大部分精力都放在这里面之后才慢慢的接触感受到了这里面的魅力。\n\n早期我也是一个在交易所里面跟着单纯就炒币、没事在社群里刷刷消息冒冒泡的小韭菜(虽然现在也是)，那个时候也不知道为什么要去投资一个项目，每天眼里只有涨跌币价甚至连很多技术分析的东西也不懂，就这么玩了一年多。在这个过程中我发现，单纯用自己的本金去做这些投资但是恰巧由于各种因素或者自己投资策略有问题选被套住了之后会无从下手又焦虑，这种等待上涨的时间过于漫长，逐渐失去对一些事物的热情，这也是让我和看项目、做交互这件事结下缘分的根本原因。后来决定改变这种现状，尝试着慢慢接触这些项目和这些生态，从公链到DEFI、从DEFI到Gamefi、从Gamefi到NFT、IDO，每天都在看文章逛推特，说实话有点上头，但每天都知道还远远不够。\n\n本身资金量足够并且有丰富投资经验的大佬除外，像我这种自身资金实力和投资经验都薄弱的人我认为是不少的，并且进来币圈的目的也都一定是赚钱。起初反正投资的东西都被套了，大部分时间我的精力都在做一些项目的小活动、测试网上面，毕竟没本金也能理解，说实话现在时间多偶尔我也会去做一做测试网，但是刚开始什么什么项目都做，光做测试网的Excel就记录了好几百行，算了一算到现在也没多少收益，但这个过程对我产生的影响是最深的，因为没有资金或者是长期在交易所做交易的那种思想，导致在链上体验生态主网的时候刚开始连每次交互合约要手续费我都掐着指头花，测试网倒是给了我无拘无束的机会。\n\n后来行情回暖，被套住的币解套还赚了钱，运气倒是不错，慢慢地也从测试网走向了主网，最开始仅仅是在主网使用一些产品，是真的需要用才会去找对应的产品，这个时候我已经把一部分资金从交易所抽到了链上，说实话还真得感谢heco和bsc，由于手续费便宜我早期大部分链上操作都是在这两条链，积累了不少经验，但也没少挨上面土狗的打。发现对于一些新项目新事物的都有了自己的看法，在进行一些投资的时候也能自己分析出一些说服自己的理由(无关对错)，思路清晰了很多，投资有胜有负但胜率提高了很多，渐渐的才意识到其实是自己在早期亲身去接触分析体验了那一些项目，并且接触得越多对整个产品的判断虽然不说绝对正确但能降低出错的概率，这也是为什么我将交互这件事一直坚持下来也希望分享给大家的原因，我希望更多的朋友可以对自己所做的事情具备自己的判断和了解而不是摸黑。\n\n最近我还喜欢上看何币大哥在推特骂人，何大哥挺有趣但又真的无奈，这个圈子给我最大的感受就是有很多愿意分享的人，是真的希望带动圈子往前走的那种。但也无奈有只会伸手的人存在。我也喜欢和每个不同的有自己见解的人交流讨论，什么东西都只会问的那就各自安好吧。\n\n## 整体脉络\n\n下面我会将我交互表单中的项目筛选出来整理好，从不同维度归类也方便大家了解不同链上的各种交互项目。这里声明一下，第一我不会写太详细的交互教程，很多项目怎么交互老玩家都有自己的一套标准，现在本身空投标准就提高了大家都一样反而没什么收益，实在摸不到门路就去自己找教程吧，推特和Mirror上都挺多；第二我整理出来的项目也仅仅是我做过的项目，我不会面面俱到并且也有自己的一些评判标准，这篇文章主要是给大家一个参考性，也不构成任何投资建议，有帮助最好没帮助那也感谢大家花了时间看(抱拳)。\n\n这里我优先以各条链归类，信息会尽量保证正确，不过难免有漏缺，大家自己也可以查资料核实一下，坐稳开始。\n\n## 一、Polygon\n\n有很多项目早期在Polygon生态上，后期支持L2，建议有条件的在做L2的时候也交互一下。\n\n### 1.Slingshot（原DEX.AG）\n\n[https://twitter.com/SlingshotCrypto](https://twitter.com/SlingshotCrypto)\n\nPolygon、Arbitrum、Optimism 等 Web3 交易平台 - 连接钱包，开始交易。\n\n融资信息：\n\n* 种子轮(2020.10) $3.1M： **Framework Ventures**领投，Electric Capital、IDEO CoLab、**Coinbase Ventures**、Winklevoss Capital、Digital Currency Group、Robot Ventures、Digital Currency Group参投。\n* A轮(2021.12) $15M：Ribbit Capital领投，K5 Global、Shrug Capital、The Chainsmokers、歌手Jason Derulo、瑞士企业家Guillaume Pousaz和媒体公司Morning Brew联合创始人Austin Rief、Electric Capital、Framework Ventures参投。\n\n交互点：\n\n* SWAP\n* NFT SHOP交易(这块可以关注下创世NFT 若空投可能会有权重占比)\n* 设置用户信息\n* 体验聊天室(每次交互的时候顺便吹个水)\n\n支持生态：Polygon、Arbitrum、Optimism，这里我放在Polygon上是因为最初在Polygon做的交互，这边大家刷ARB和OP的时候也可以顺便交互一下。\n\n[https://app.slingshot.finance/](https://app.slingshot.finance/)\n\n### 2.Clipper\n\n[https://twitter.com/Clipper_DEX](https://twitter.com/Clipper_DEX)\n\nClipper 是去中心化交易所 (DEX)，旨在为白手起家的加密货币交易者提供小额交易（< 10,000 美元）的最佳价格。以 Clipper 为向导，在 DeFi 的波涛汹涌的大海中航行。\n\n融资信息：\n\n* 股权融资(2021.7) $4M： **Polychain Capital**领投，0x Labs、1inch、DeFi Alliance和Quantstamp等参投。\n* 流动性融资(2021.7) $17M：**Polychain Capital**、Nascent、LD Capital、Three Arrows Capital、Electric Capital、IOSG向Clipper的流动性池提供1700万美元。\n\n交互点：\n\n* SWAP\n* 提供流动性\n* 最新海盗船活动(22.5.9)\n\n支持生态：Ethereum、Optimism、Polygon、Moonbeam，这里放在Polygon的理由同上Slingshot。\n\n[https://clipper.exchange/](https://clipper.exchange/)\n\n### 3.

LayerZero\n\n[https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs](https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs)\n\n通过LayerZero协议，开发者五需依赖中间者，就可以搭建跨任何链的智能合约，使它们在多条链之间方便安全地互通信息。这里所指的信息范围很大，常说的跨链转移token只是跨链通信一个应用场景。\n\n融资信息：\n\n* 种子 $2M\n* A轮(2021.4) $6M：Multicoin(原Anyswap)、**Binance Labs**领投，Sino Global Capital、Defiance、Delphi Digital、Robot Ventures，Spartan、Hypersphere Ventures、Protocol Ventures和Gen Block Capital参投。\n* A+轮(2022.3) $135M：**FTX Ventures**、**红杉资本**、**a16z**领投，**Coinbase Ventures**、PayPal Ventures、Tiger Global、Uniswap Labs、Animoca Brands、软银CEO Rene Marcelo Claure 、Avalanche生态基金、Polygon生态基金、Fantom生态基金、Dapper Labs、ImToken Ventures、Matrixport、Gemini参投。\n* 待定 (2022.5) 最近正以30亿美元估值进行融资谈判，FTX Ventures承诺领投\n\n交互点：\n\n* 交互使用LayerZero协议的项目\n\n支持生态：Ethereum、BSC、Avalanche、Polygon、Arbitrum、Optimism、Fantom。\n\n[https://layerzero.network/](https://layerzero.network/)\n\n### 2.

At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17around 20 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J8zu2hqPwpMn4gBJxvyZO.png?height=790&width=1370)\n\nYou can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-curie-arbitrageur\n\nThe way **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)** works is that, whenever there is a price difference between [Perp v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) (a derivative DEX) and [FTX](https://ftx.com/) (a CEX), the bot will buy on the cheaper side and sell on the more expensive side. Out of the box, this template allows you to set the desired price difference for the bot to take action. Additionally, you can specify the markets for the bot to run the arbitrage strategy.\n\nOf course, we can’t just look at the rewards. How about the risks associated with running this bot?\n\nThe main risk is liquidation, which can happen when you use too much leverage to trade on either Perp v2 or FTX. Luckily, the bot lets you set the margin ratio you’re comfortable with, which is the reciprocal of leverage, and it will start to reduce the position sizes whenever the margin ratio is reached.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n***If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot by the readme in the [perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.***\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned what Perp v2 is and the risks and rewards of running an arbitraging bot on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a bot on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35K8a0HNOpAgrqyZe8-9u.png?height=1056&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer.\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmWcwfTH5meqjcgJXX42B.png?height=772&width=1368)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FG5l25__gsXRy2WqTwan9.png?height=976&width=1026)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-curie-arbitrageur repo and build it locally. You can do so with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur.git`\n\n`cd perp-curie-arbitrageur`\n\n`npm install`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything goes well, you should be able to see responses like the ones below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oHajKZfB6oCOvhrfk_ln.png?height=420&width=1366)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances, especially those who claim to be part of a customer service team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AZkHnVO2PIpDf7g12I2Ix.png?height=808&width=1366)\n\n## Get the Tokens you Need\n\nThere are two tokens we need in order to run perp-curie-arbitrageur. They are ETH and USDC. **Please be aware that, since there is no test account on FTX, we’ll be using real ETH and USDC in the following**. It’s better to start with a small amount to get comfortable with it and then increase from there.\n\n* **For ETH**:\n\n  If you only use CEXes like Binance or FTX, you can use [LayerSwap](https://www.layerswap.io/) to transfer some of your ETH to Optimism. If you have ETH on chains like Ethereum or BNB Chain, you can use [TransferTo.xyz](https://transferto.xyz/swap) to bridge your ETH to Optimism. **ETH is used to pay the gas fees for your transactions** and each transaction on Perp v2 costs around 0.001 ETH, so even 0.1 ETH can be used for a long time.\n* **For USDC**:\n\n  Similar to ETH, you can use either LayerSwap or TransferTo depending on how much you want to transfer and from where. And as mentioned above, **USDC is used as the collateral for your positions**.\n\nAlso, because by default, MetaMask doesn’t include Optimism in the network list, you need to go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to add Optimism to your MetaMask to see your ETH and USDC balance in your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni590TmTaReallO5-aRV6.png?height=764&width=1366)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Rename the .env.example file to .env and modify it\n\nYou need to rename the .env.example file in the root folder of perp-curie-arbitrageur to .env and add a web3 endpoint, your wallet’s private key, and everything related to FTX to it. Here is what your .env file looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TBM7eUvmNl8RN63gTvlWy.png?height=386&width=1366)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint for Optimism, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)**. If you wonder what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider, e.g. Infura, will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/74kJqYT6TE7k7ntWyKUE8.png?height=796&width=1366)\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.”  Similar to recovery phrases, you should **never** share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uI8QlZXgLQLdkFhHl6ucq.png?height=950&width=560)\n\nAs for FTX’s API key and secret, you can generate them by going to the [API page](https://ftx.com/settings/api) of your subaccount and clicking \"Create API Key”. The permission should be “Trading” only.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XQOmbcYNb_-sCsYEVNr-c.png?height=454&width=820)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* BALANCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check your balance on FTX and your address.\n* ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH:\n* BALANCE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH: The maximum amount of gas fees in ETH that you’re willing to pay to do arbitrage. One thing worth pointing out is that , Optimism uses the first-comes, first-served approach to process transactions, meaning that increasing the ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH will not confirm any faster.\n* PERP_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO: As we mentioned above, the margin ratio is the metric to show how many leverages you use. The lower this metric, the easier for your position to get liquidated.  If you set them as 0.2, then the max leverage is 5x. Recommended to start from 1 to be safe.\n* PERP_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO: The margin ratio threshold when the positions on both platforms will start to be reduced. For instance, if you set them as 0.1 here, that means your positions will begin to be closed when your leverage reaches 10x. Recommended to begin with a number that is closer to 1 to start with.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_AMOUNT: 9000,\n  The USD value of the position that the bot should start to close when the emergency margin ratio is reached.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_SLEEP_SEC: The interval between each emergency reduction should be.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency that emergency checks should be conducted.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to true to enable this market.\n* FTX_MARKET_NAME: The name of the market on FTX. Usually, if it’s a perpetual market, then it’ll follow a naming convention of ticker-perp. For instance, BTC’s perpetual market is known as BTC-PERP on FTX.\n* ORDER_AMOUNT: Order amount in USDC for each trade. Remember to top up your account before running the bot.\n* SHORT_TRIGGER_SPREAD:\n* LONG_TRIGGER_SPREAD: The price difference threshold between both platforms at which the bot should start executing your strategy.\n* IS_EMERGENCY_REDUCE_MODE_ENABLED:\n  Whether (or not) the bot should reduce positions when the leverage is too high.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. However, the bot can support up to 5 markets simultaneously. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally\n\nThere is one extra step for Windows users - you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file otherwise it can’t read the parameters in your .env file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully on your machine, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5Go3tdgnLsHOHaraBjw0.png?height=564&width=1022)\n\n## Run on AWS Lambda\n\n*If you’re not familiar with AWS Lambda, you can watch this video to [learn more about it (or serverless in general) in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_VV2Fx32_Y&ab_channel=Fireship). But in general, the main selling point of AWS’ Lambda is that, instead of renting a dedicated server on AWS to run your program 24/7. You only pay the times when your application runs on a shared server, which is more suitable for our use case as the bot only runs from time to time based on your settings.*\n\nAs a starter for this section, **you need to register an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and install AWS CLI on your machine**. Check the installation instructions for each OS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).\n\n**Once AWS CLI is installed, you need to [configure your AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) by running the following command** in your Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows):\n\n`aws configure`\n\nThen you need to type your access key and secret. You can create them from the [Identity and Access Management page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oY3trcl2-nanWI5PxCV5L.png?height=258&width=1178)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YStXJ4AHlHEkI_b9QQTuw.png?height=686&width=1218)\n\nDepending on your settings, sometimes you need to create a new user on AWS to generate a key. To do so, you need to click Users on the Identity and Access Management page and then create a new user with permission to manage Lambda.\n\n**Following this, you need to type the AWS region you use in the .env file in your perp-curie-arbitrageur folder**. For instance, add AWS_REGION=ap-southest-1 to the file if you choose a server located in Singapore.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i13sUcuIHcQhUTzwfacHo.png?height=686&width=1228)\n\nAlso, for Windows users who have run the bot locally in the previous sections, you need to remove the two lines that you added in the index.ts file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nBy now we’re all set! Enter the following commands in your terminal to deploy the bot to AWS:\n\n`npm run build`\n\n`npm run sls:deploy`\n\nYou should be able to see the following responses if everything goes well:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HgxYHicK9JFy_6nU9HplL.png?height=490&width=1228)\n\nOnce your bot is running, you can see the real-time logs by going to the *perp-arbitrageur-production-main* Lambda function on AWS and clicking the “View logs in CloudWatch” under the Monitor tab. You should be able to see similar logs when running the bot on your computer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KmdiO6etAAGga9RGrOsYr.png?height=716&width=1228)\n\nCongratulations! Your bot is now automatically arbitraging the price difference between Perp v2 and FTX!\n\n## Further Modification Suggestions\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article, this bot is just a template for arbitraging between Perp v2 and FTX. Given the nature of an open-sourced software, anyone can add functionalities to this bot. Below are some directions that you can explore:\n\n* **Support more DEXes and CEXes**\n\n  You can modify the bot to support for CEXes like Binance or Huobi to discover more arbitraging opportunities. It also applies to derivative DEXs as there are numerous of them on the market.\n* **Better position wind down process**\n\n  Currently, the bot will close positions from both exchanges when the margin ratio reaches the limit you set. A better approach to wind down positions should be closing both sides when the prices on both exchanges are the same and do it gradually to reduce price impact aka slippage per trade.\n* **Error or success report**\n\n  Right now the bot only does its job quietly and you can only check CloudWatch to know its status. One way to improve this is to add a script to send out a Telegram or Discord message when certain criteria are met.

{"id": "yg82Wchpeg_DipqXcte6TTA59Y1ie1v9qUUMLUpUZgg", "title": "基于区块链技术的去中心化身份平台研究", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_o7W5U9w6rYF339sUQA9e.gif?height=200&width=540)\n\n**一 、什么是去中心化身份**\n\n去中心化身份（DID）是基于身份管理的信任框架，**它允许用户在不依赖特定服务提供商的情况下生成和控制自己的数字身份**。根据Forrester的说法，“去中心化数字身份 (DID) 不仅仅是一个技术流行语：它承诺将当前中心化的物理和数字身份生态系统彻底重组为去中心化和民主化的架构。”\n\n在整Web3.0的架构中，去中心化身份（Decentralized Identity，DID）是至关重要的一环。DID与Web3.0的核心理念相符，允许用户拥有并控制自己的数字身份。\n\nDID中包含用户的身份信息和隐私数据，只有在经过用户授权的情况下才能使用，具有安全性、可验证和互操作性等特点。DID系统以去中心化的方式实现身份的发现、识别和验证，不依赖中心化身份系统的审核和许可。\n\n随着互联网的出现和普及，传统的身份有了另外一种表现形式，即数字身份。一般认为，数字身份的演进经历了四个阶段，分别是:中心化身份、联盟身份、以用户为中心的身份以及自我主权身份。\n\n**1、中心化身份**是由单一的权威机构进行管理和控制的，现在互联网上的大多数身份还是中心化身份。\n\n例如我们熟悉的支付宝、微信等账号。显然，中心化身份的使用权由中心主体和用户共同享有，但身份的生成权、解释权、存储权都集中在身体提供商，由此带来了身份不自主可控、隐私泄漏、可移植性差、互操作性差以及单点风险等一系列问题。\n\n**2、联盟身份**的出现解决了中心化身份中身份数据零碎混乱的弊端，此种身份是有多个机构或者联盟进行管理和控制的，用户的身份数据具备了一定程度的可移植性。\n\n例如允许用户登录某个网站时，可以使用其他网站的账户信息，类似于FB、GOOGLE或者APPLE的跨平台登录。\n\n**3、以用户为中心的身份**希望实现的是用户通过授权和许可，可以决定身份的存储和使用以及将身份从一个服务共享到另一个服务。\n\n因此侧重于三个元素：用户的许可、互操作性以及基于用户对数据的完全掌控。但是，以用户为中心的身份计划并没有获得成功。\n\n以OpenID为例，用户理论上可以注册属于自己的OpenID，但是由于技术门槛较高，普通的互联网用户更倾向于在一个公共的并且相对可靠的网站上注册OpenID来登录到其他的网站。\n\n因此，用户注册的OpenID有着随时被网络提供商剥夺的风险，这意味着，用户并没有完全取得自己身份数据的掌控权。\n\n**4、自我主权身份**才是真正意义上的去中心化的、完全由个人所拥有和控制的身份。要使身份具有真正的自我主权，这种基础设施必然需要驻留在分散信任的环境中。而随着区块链技术的出现，自我主权身份的实现找到了突破口。\n\n\\*\\*分布式身份从根本上解决了中心化身份的问题，不依赖于中心身份提供商，真正具备身份的自主可控性、安全性、自解释性、可移植性、互操作性。\\*\\*在分布式场景下赋予每个用户自主控制和使用数字身份的能力，并针对身份数据等敏感信息进行隐私保护。\n\nWeb3.0向我们描绘了一个万物互联的可信网络世界，\\*\\*实现了数据的确权与授权、强隐私保护、开放的抗审查的自由数据交换。\\*\\*以DID为基础构建去中心化运行的统一身份认证平台正是Web3.0发展的重要实践之一。\n\n**二 、去中心化身份的优势**\n\n通过区块链技术，使用自主权的数字身份允许用户真正拥有并控制自己的个人数据和资产。相对于传统的身份认证，基于区块链技术的数字身份认证具有保证数据真实有效、保护用户隐私安全、可实现跨部门、跨行业共享的特征，其优势在于：\n\n\\*\\*分散化（去中心化）：\\*\\*基于分布式账本进行使用和存储，避免了身份数据被单一的中心化的权威机构所控制。\n\n\\*\\*防篡改：\\*\\*基于区块链的不可篡改特性，身份数据也将难以篡改。\n\n\\*\\*控制权回到用户手中：\\*\\*用户掌握身份数据的控制权，是自我主权身份的特点和要求。\n\n\\*\\*安全性：\\*\\*除了用户行为之外，区块链分类账上的去中心化系统通过先进的加密和密码学本质上是安全的。\n\n在现实世界中，身份是一个社会能否良好运转的不可或缺的一部分。护照帮助政府用于识别公民，驾驶执照允许公民合法上路，大学学位则代表了资质授予等。同样，DID将促成更高价值的互联网经济活动。\n\n下面，我们重点介绍DID可以解决的一些当前Web3的痛点。\n\n**1、NFTs——身份与真实性**\n\n诈骗和抄袭问题也困扰着艺术家或创作者。例如，Marvel超级英雄故事的设计者，数字艺术家Derek Laufman看到他的作品在他不知情的情况下在NFT平台Rarible上被拍卖。类似这样的故事很常见。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BUAwEhR8Akgp7v6-Cv90z.png?height=210&width=640)\n\n而DID基础架构可以解决这个问题。应用程序可以基于DID构建，以允许创建者可以证明这一NFT是由他们创建的。买家和卖家也将能够验证数字艺术品的出处。DID还可以强化艺术家和社区之间的纽带，例如将NFT所有权限制在社区成员中，以此限制黄牛的投机行为，或向特定持有者提供独享NFT内容。\n\n更广泛地说，NFT可以作为去中心化身份的一个锚点。现在的一些用户不仅仅通过用户名来展示自己，NFT形象也是重要体现。例如，Manifold联合创始人 @richerd说自己曾经拒绝了950万美元的加密朋克NFT报价，因为他将加密朋克视为自己的身份和品牌。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rfXEAcPHV3NQDwqYoPI4f.png?height=431&width=640)\n\n**2、解锁DeFi的下一阶段**\n\n到目前为止，抵押借贷一直是DeFi增长的支柱。但由于加密金融协议旨在完全无需信任和许可，因此它们通常需要超额抵押。\n\n例如，MakerDAO上的ETH贷款要求抵押率在130-170%之间。这推动了去年DeFi的增长，但抵押品的要求将限制大多数希望利用杠杆的加密货币交易者。对于大多数人来说，他们想借钱的原因是他们还没有他们需要的钱。\n\n降低或完全取消抵押要求是将DeFi引入大规模采用的关键。DID层可以为“链上”信用评分，为用户提供基于信用的贷款。此外，由于用户直接控制自身的信用评分，可以更好地监控和调整自身的借贷行为。因此，DID提供了进一步民主化去中心化金融系统的机会。\n\n此外，为金融应用程序提供强大的身份验证层可以解决DeFi中当前的其他问题，例如：\n\n1）通过对实际成员进行身份验证来减少机器人稀释空投事件的可能来改善代币空投的公平分配。\n\n2）使用DID限制对DeFi池的访问，以减少垃圾邮件/女巫攻击。\n\n3）指引可以信任的参与者以正和游戏方式行事，引导用户穿越以太坊的黑暗森林。\n\n**3、去中心化自治组织 (DAOs)**\n\nDAOs通常使用基于代币的治理来进行投票、治理或判定优先级。这通常是有道理的——大型代币持有者在游戏中的利益最重——但它可能排除或取消没有大量资本的活跃贡献者的优先级。尽管成员可以在DAO中建立自己的声誉，但他们可能需要在新的环境中从头开始建立信誉。\n\nDID可以在多个DAO中维护用户的声誉。将凭证从一个DAO移植到另一个DAO，从而避免了积极的贡献者从零开始的无意义消耗。此外，在其他Web3应用方向，例如参与Gitcoin、向Mirror发布或向Radicle贡献代码，可以进一步帮助DAO找到合格的贡献者与参与者。\n\n**三 、去中心化身份生态系统**\n\nDID生态系统可以分为多层，其上的每一层都建立在底层的协议之上。DIF的4层去中心化身份模型如下图所示。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RPjxUN-gfpGokCTLquDZQ.png?height=494&width=640)\n\n**第 1 层：标识符和标准**\n\n标准、标识符和命名空间创建公共信任层，确保标准化、可移植性和互通性。它们还允许网络注册和管理DID方法，为开发人员和用户提供网络ID系统的规则。\n\n万维网联盟（W3C）和去中心化身份基金会（DIF）是这一层的关键参与者，也是生态系统的基石。它充当开发、讨论和管理为DID堆栈创建活动以及维护可互通和开放的生态系统活动的中心。\n\n**第 2 层：基础设施**\n\n基础设施和代理框架允许应用程序和可验证的数据注册表之间彼此直接交互。这些解决方案包括通信、存储和密钥管理。我们将Ceramic和ENS列为构建DID基础设施的前沿项目（尽管ENS的分类可能存在争议，但我们将其置于基础设施层，因为我们预计未来将在ENS之上构建凭证和应用程序）。\n\n**第 3 层：凭证**\n\n凭证必须有管理、更新和交换。这一层旨在解决DID如何协调控制证明和进行身份验证，也包括在不同身份之间安全地传递数据。\n\nBrightID是该领域的一个著名项目。这是一个拥有超过30,000名用户的社交身份网络，允许人们向应用程序证明他们没有使用多个帐户，从而最大限度地减少女巫攻击的机会。\n\n**第 4 层：应用程序、钱包和产品**\n\n这一层可能是读者最熟悉的，旨在为消费者提供真实的使用价值。一些项目，如Goldfinch（无抵押贷款），使用专有的唯一实体验证方式，但仍希望在成熟时利用DID解决方案。相比之下，其他应用程序已经利用了现有的DID技术，例如TrueFi（具有链上信用评分的无抵押贷款）、Gitcoin（公共产品资金）和Ethsign（去中心化电子协议）。\n\n**四 W3C的DID标准**\n\nW3C标准的DID系统主要包括以下层次要素：\n\n\\*\\*基础层：\\*\\*DID规范\n\nDID标识符（Identifier）\n\nDID文档（Document）\n\n\\*\\*应用层：\\*\\*可验证声明\n\n可验证声明（Verifiable Claims 或 Verifiable Credentials，简称VC。\n\n**1. DID 规范**\n\n1）DID标识符，是一个全局唯一的表示你身份的东西，就像你的身份证号码一样。其形式大致如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MYOvCtTnkpf3G0zi_T7h3.png?height=121&width=522)\n\nDID示例：did:eth:123456789abcdefg\n\nDID标识符不容易记忆。根据Zooko三角形理论，没有任何标识符能够同时实现易记忆、安全、去中心化。在这里，W3C的DID取了后两者。\n\nDID Infrastructure是一个全局键值对数据库，这个数据库要么是某个DID兼容的区块链，要么是某个DID兼容的分布式账本，或者是某个DID兼容的去中心化网络（其实这个数据库的位置就是DID标识符中的example字段，目前已经有非常多的合法地址）。在这个数据库中，DID标识符是键，而DID文档是值。\n\n2）DID文档是一个JSON-LD Object，包括6个部分（都是optional的）：\n\n1、DID标识符。\n\n2、一个加密材料的集合。比如公钥。\n\n3、一个加密协议的集合。\n\n4、一个服务端点的集合。\n\n5、时间戳。\n\n6、一个可选的JSON-LD签名。用来证明这个DID文档是合法的。\n\n文档内容示例：\n\n{\n\n\"@context\": \"https://w3id.org/did/v1\",\n\n\"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n\"authentication\": \\[{\n\n// used to authenticate as did:...fghi\n\n\"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1\",\n\n\"type\": \"RsaVerificationKey2018\",\n\n\"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n\"publicKeyPem\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\\\\r\\\\n\"\n\n}\\],\n\n\"service\": \\[{\n\n// used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID\n\n\"id\":\"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs\",\n\n\"type\": \"VerifiableCredentialService\",\n\n\"serviceEndpoint\": \"https://example.com/vc/\"\n\n}\\]\n\n}\n\n这里需要注意的是，DID文档中没有任何和你个人真实信息相关的内容，比如你的真实姓名、地址、手机号等。因此光靠DID规范是无法验证一个人的身份的，必须要靠DID应用层中的VC。\n\n**2. 可验证声明**\n\nW3C认为前面的DID规范是基础，而把可验证声明视作是next higher layer，并认为这一层才是建立DID整个体系的价值所在。因为在这个应用层中，DID既可以用来标识个体的身份、也可以用来标识组织的身份，甚至标识物品的身份。\n\n可验证声明类似于数字签名，要实现数字签名，需要有PKI体系，可验证声明也是一样，需要用一套系统来支持它。在可验证声明系统中，有以下几种参与者：\n\n\\*\\*发行者：\\*\\*拥有用户数据并能开具可验证声明的实体，如政府、银行、大学等机构和组织。\n\n**验证者**：接受可验证声明并进行验证，由此可以提供给出示可验证声明者某种类型的服务。\n\n\\*\\*持有者：\\*\\*向发行者请求、收到、持有可验证声明的实体。向验证者出示可验证声明。开具的可验证声明可以放在可验证声明钱包里，方便以后再次使用。\n\n\\*\\*标识符注册机构：\\*\\*维护去中心化身份数据库，如某条区块链、分布式账本。\n\n**五、 基于区块链技术的去中心化身份平台**\n\n**1.uPort**\n\nuPort是基于以太坊的分布式数字身份管理服务，它可以允许用户进行身份验证、无密登录、数字签名并和以太坊上的其它应用交互。\n\nuPort的整体架构由智能合约、开发者库和移动APP组成。其中移动APP持有用户的密钥。以太坊智能合约构成身份管理的核心，包括用户的uPort标识符管理、身份凭证的管理、以及可让用户在丢失移动设备时恢复身份的逻辑。开发者库可让第三方应用开发者把uPort集成到他们的应用中。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nuPort的底层基础设施是公有链以太坊。uPort DID方法已注册到W3C维护的注册表。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\nuPort智能合约设计体现了用户对数字身份的管理控制和使用。用户使用uPort DID登录其他在以太坊上注册的应用。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NkkszDQfGuZz-fUo5mA2X.jpeg?height=264&width=775)\n\n**uPort基于标识符的交互方式**\n\n**（1）标识符**\n\n其中，代理合约是用户数字身份的象征，uPort身份的核心标识符是代理合约的地址；控制合约，是代理合约的正式拥有者。\n\n控制合约维护了核心访问控制特性，包含密钥恢复和访问控制逻辑；控制合约由uPort移动App中安全存储的密钥进行控制。\n\n这种设计允许用户使用密钥向代理合约自我认证，并代表代理合约行事，有利于用户在保持标识符不变的情况下替换私钥。\n\n**（2）交互**\n\n应用DAPP与uPort App均使用了以太坊智能合约，代理合约可以向应用合约转发交易，并且通过这种机制，uPort身份与以太坊区块链上的其他智能合约进行交互。\n\n**（3）可验证凭证应用层**\n\nuPort的身份认证应用中的用户角色包含凭证发放机构、用户、应用、uPort共四方。\n\nuPort和凭证发布机构合作，凭证发放机构在以太坊网络上注册自己的身份，能够签署和验证数据；凭证发放机构在其应用中提供二维码信息以便于用户交互，用户使用uPort APP扫描二维码，向凭证发放机构注册自己的uPort ID。凭证发放机构根据业务需求按自己的方式认证用户信息，认证通过后向用户发放带有签名的身份凭证。\n\nuPort服务通过注册合约管理uPort ID和用户的身份凭证信息，每一个uPort身份标识符绑定了一个相关的链下数据结构（如：IPFS），身份凭证存储在链下。注册合约扮演逻辑上中心化，物理上去中心的注册表或查找表，将每一个uPort身份标识符映射到一个IPFS摘要上，这个IPFS摘要与包含了用户属性、个人数据、见证的结构相链接。只有uPort身份的所有者（设备密钥的持有者）才有权利去修改相对应的注册入口。\n\n用户注册新的应用时，应用通过二维码与用户交互，获取uPort ID和应用需要的凭证。如果用户注册合约中已经存储了相应的凭证，应用从uPort服务器获取该凭证进行验证。验证通过后，应用将uPort ID注册为用户账户，以后用户只需要使用uPort ID即可登录该应用。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nuPort没有提出新的治理框架，遵循了以太坊的治理模式，即通过以太币支付网络交易费用。\n\n**2.ENS**\n\n以太坊名称服务（ENS）是一种基础工具，可将任何以太坊地址转换为公共配置文件。它的主要工作是将人类可读的名称映射成机器可读的状态。你可以使用amberfin.eth，而不是使用一长串依靠人脑无从记忆的地址来进行交易。并且由于ENS的分层性质，拥有该域的任何人也可能拥有子域。\n\n例如，因为Amber Group拥有“amberfin.eth”它也可以创建“pay.amberfin.eth”。\n\n**Amber Group的ENS记录**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_nAD0Oatm3XJVfHx56Pey.png?height=432&width=640)\n\nENS的使用者继续增长。与ENS的完整DNS集成于今年8月启动，因此您可以将加密货币发送到“example.com”而不是“example.eth”。\n\n此外，.eth域名也可用于构建去中心化网站。例如，以太坊联合创始人Vitalik Buterin利用这种DNS集成以及IPFS在**https://vitalik.eth/创建了一个强大且抗审查的网站。**\n\nENS或许可以在去中心化身份的未来发挥关键作用。它被注册为DID表示，允许将ENS名称包装为DID以促进互通性。许多Web3用户已经使用ENS作为他们的标识符。\n\n一项对约300名以太坊用户的调查发现，约64%的人已经拥有ENS，链上分析表明，ENS用户平均拥有2.5个域名。随着其他功能的推出（例如NFT头像支持）和dApp越来越多地采用ENS，Web3用户很可能会越来越多地使用ENS作为他们在以太坊上的身份象征。\n\n**Uniswap 上的ENS名称：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L3ixRErtHlRSQdYVYko87.png?height=86&width=640)\n\n**ENS 生态系统如下：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2q_Tq6dZopAqlanz3pPyX.png?height=502&width=592)\n\n**3. Litentry**\n\nLitentry是一个波卡（Polkadot）生态去中心化跨链身份协议，为DeFi、链上治理等Polkadot生态内外的应用提供精细化的链上身份信用服务，在区块链网络中共同打造一个可信的去中心化身份聚合器，成为Web3.0网络中的重要基础设施，为大规模应用落地做好准备。\n\n2022年10月，Litentry完成数百万美元的种子轮融资；2022年初，推出了移动端App。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0XdvDVaXME261iX3UbNOl.png?height=441&width=1221)\n\nLitentry作为跨链身份聚合器旨在将不同链上数字身份的信息进行整合，创造一个链上的身份信用体系。Litentry构建的用户信用体系可以帮助项目方识别哪些是为项目做贡献、行为良好的用户，给予更多的权利与奖励。而用户本身也会为自身名誉和利益考虑，为区块链的发展做出更多有利的行为。\n\n相比于身份赛道的其他产品，基于波卡的Litentry拥有更庞大的生态基础，应用空间也更广阔。Litentry本身还具备公开、透明、自主更新等特点，任何人都可以参与其中，并且早期参与者还能够获得一定的通证激励。\n\n对于Litentry来说，现在最重要的是完成测试网的开发，以及在平行链插槽拍卖之前或者同时上线主网。\n\n**4. Sovrin**\n\nSovrin是Evernym初始开发、Sovrin基金会运营、Hyperledger孵化开源的一种用户自主主权身份和去中心化信任的协议，它致力于提供自我主权身份的去中心化的全球公共网络，该网络于2017年7月正式启动。\n\nSovrin是一种用户主权身份的基础设施和全球可互操作的身份协议，它不是一种具体的解决方案，不依赖于特定软件实现，不同的解决方案实现厂商可基于Sovrin协议和基础设施搭建具有互操作性的平台。Sovrin定义了分层的、解耦合、模块化的模型。\n\nSovrin基金会牵头推进了Hyperledger Indy项目，提供基于区块链或其他分布式账本技术的工具、代码库和模块化组件用于实现独立的数字主权身份。\n\n2019年，从Indy项目中独立出了Hyperledger Aries项目，用于实现其中的端到端交互。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nSovrin基金会管理了一个特定的账本SovrinLedger，由Stewards操作节点与Sovrin共识协议进行通信维护，但同时Sovrin协议可以运行在任何支持上面三层的分布式账本上，不依赖于一种特定的区块链或分布式账本技术，才能形成全球可互操作的用户主权身份网络。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\nSovrin支持基于DID进行点对点相互认证和安全通信，并且在HyperledgerAries项目中孵化一套标准化的端到端交互软件基础设施，Aries项目于2019年提出。\n\nAries的功能包括：建立和使用点对点连接，发送/接收点对点协议消息，并代表模块所代表的实体执行操作。它是Sovrin基础架构的基石，通过该模块，Sovrin实体形成连接并共享Sovrin身份。点对点连接是两个Sovrin实体之间关系的基本单位，由一对仅被双方实体知道的匿名标识符组成，这样可以最大限度地避免一个实体的多个标识符被第三方归集。\n\n**（3）可验证凭证应用层**\n\n基于零知识证明的匿名凭证技术实现了可验证凭证，支持凭证信息的最小化披露。支持对一个或多个凭证中的声明进行选择、组合并出示；凭证验证方不获得数据明文或密文，而仅获得数据的密码学验证方法，因此也无法复用它来模拟另一个用户。典型例子是在不揭示实际出生日期信息的情况下，出示有关年龄情况的证明（如“18岁以上”）。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nSovrin基金会发布了治理框架，建立用于自我主权身份的分布式网络所需的治理方法。框架定义了Sovrin网络所有成员同意遵守的商业、法律和技术术语，并且规定了Sovrin基金会和成员之间的法律合同。\n\n**5. 微软 DID**\n\n微软DID是一套基于Azure云服务的分布式数字身份技术架构和基础功能，让解决方案实施商可方便的在不同区块链上实现分布式数字身份整体解决方案。微软是DIF联盟的重要成员，以标准的开源技术、协议和参考实现为主要目标。\n\n微软DID的技术架构包括区块链BAAS服务、注册DID的Layer2方法ION、隐私数据管理模块Identity Hub，均以API的形式为开发者提供服务，ION和Identity Hub还提供了开源软件。在未实现的计划中，还包括手机端的身份管理模块。\n\n通过区块链BAAS服务向不同区块链注册分布式数字身份标识，可以成为广泛使用的中间层，实现DIF的互联互通目标。\n\nION方法是SideTree协议基于比特币网络的实现，用于解决向公有链注册DID存在的效率低下问题。\n\nIdentity Hub为开发者提供了管理用户隐私数据的基础模块。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\n微软DID的基础设施不依赖于特定的分布式账本。与Azure区块链服务的设计思想一脉相承，微软DID依托于Azure云服务支持多种分布式账本协议，并且注册了基于该分布式账本的DID操作方法，对开发者隐藏分布式账本的接入细节，提供Restful API接口。\n\n**目前微软DID支持以下两个DID操作方法：**\n\n1、Ion-test：注册到比特币测试网络\n\n2、test：注册到微软数据库\n\n**同时正在开发对以下三个分布式账本的支持：**\n\n1、比特币正式网络\n\n2、通过uport的DID方法，注册到以太坊\n\n3、通过Sovrin的DID方法，注册到Sovrin网络\n\n在DID注册和查询过程中，为解决公链效率低下的问题，微软DIF联盟的几个成员发起了SideTree协议，**构建了L1层公链和L2层DID操作的分层架构：**\n\n1、L2层保存了DID操作的源数据并推送到IPFS网络，汇聚尽可能多的DID操作后锚定到L1层。\n\n2、L2层的每个“节点”各自与L1层同步，获取 Sidetree锚定交易后，拉取DID操作源数据。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fnsKT84YImRSw1C8Qkr42.jpeg?height=901&width=800)\n\n                                                             SideTree架构\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互&可验证凭证应用**\n\n微软DID中未提供完整的DID交互和可验证凭证应用软件，由开发者根据自己需求进行设计。微软DID主要为开发者提供了Identity Hub模块，它的目标是为用户存储和管理隐私数据，以增强数据表达能力的“语义数据模型”实现。在DIF的认可下，已发布了第一版开源代码。与传统的数据存储解决方案相比，Identity Hub具有去中心化的特性：\n\n**1、标准化接口：**Hub的实现厂商需要满足标准化的数据存取接口，包括为每个用户的Hub注册DID，不同用户的Hub通过DID标识符进行互操作。\n\n**2、开源：**通过开源代码，鼓励开发者运营自己的Hub。\n\nIdentity Hub支持与用户通过DID进行点对点的安全通信，遵循DIDAuth的相互认证和加密传输。\n\n**6. WeIdentity**\n\nWeIdentity是基于联盟链的可信数据交换解决方案，它是一套基于FISCO-BCOS区块链底层平台的解决方案，也是BCOS联盟链的应用场景。联盟链为各用户角色提供了接入中心，为数据交换提供了数据存证和验证功能。\n\nWeIdentity中的用户角色包括凭证发行者、凭证验证者、用户代理和用户共四种，其中用户代理一般为权威可信机构，为用户KYC并生成数字身份标识符，用户的数字身份和隐私数据托管于用户代理中。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nWeIdentity基于微众银行的FISCO-BCOS联盟链实现，其整体架构具有明显的联盟链特征。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\n用户的数字身份标识符、个人数据均托管于用户代理中，由用户代理与凭证发行方和凭证验证方进行通信。\n\n因此，用户与其它实体之间的通信均通过用户代理进行转接。用户代理由场景选择，一个场景中一般具有一个用户代理，这个用户代理成为一个联盟链网络中的中心转接点。\n\n本方案中的数字身份标识符等同于联盟链中的身份合约，是一条链上的唯一标识，提供了链上行为的可验证和追溯特性。由于用户的实体身份和标识符通过用户代理机构绑定，用户行为可查可归集。\n\n**（3）应用层**\n\n应用层是WeIdentity解决方案的重点，以可验证凭证数据模型规范作为标准的数据组织方式并进行分享。其目的是借助区块链实现可信数据的交换，提供直接出示和链上授权两种方式。\n\n1）直接出示\n\n2）链上授权（适合用于用户代理也不能保存数据原文的情况）\n\n**.**凭证发行方产生凭证，同时上链存证凭证摘要。\n\n**.**用户向凭证验证方发行一个授权凭证，并上链存证授权凭证摘要。\n\n**.**凭证验证方向凭证发行方请求数据，出示用户授权凭证，凭证发行方进行验证。\n\n**.**验证通过后，凭证发行方与凭证验证方建立数据传输通道进行数据传输。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nWeIdentity是基于场景落地的联盟链解决方案，治理方式也具有明显的联盟链特征。\n\n联盟链中，新成员加入都需要进行KYC。个人用户通过用户代理机构进行KYC和业务接入，比如使用用户代理机构提供的身份管理工具App；机构用户可通过部署区块链节点、或通过业务发起方提供开放平台的方式接入联盟链。\n\n除用户代理外，系统中还有一类具有特殊权限的权威机构。链上每个WeIdentity DID持有者（包括人，机构，或者物）都可以成为凭证发行者，但只有联盟链里面的权威机构才可以注册成为 Authority Issuer。每个注册为 AuthorityIssuer的新成员需要联盟链内其他机构投票通过。\n\n系统中还有一些联盟链的内部治理角色，如系统管理员、机构委员会等。WeIdentity的角色权限管理通过智能合约实现，不同类型的合约角色分配不同的权限。\n\n**7. Ceramic**\n\nCeramic Network是一个去中心化的、世界性的、运行Ceramic协议的节点网络，通过Libp2p点对点网络协议的专用主题进行通信。Ceramic自称由于其独特的设计，系统能够实现目前最好的水平可扩展性、吞吐量和性能。\n\nCeramic为开发者提供了类似数据库的功能，用于存储各种动态、可变的内容。这最终为开发者提供了一种Web3原生的方式，让他们可以为Dapp添加一些关键功能，如丰富的身份信息（档案、声誉、社交图表）、用户生成的内容（帖子、互动）、动态应用数据等等。\n\n在Ceramic上，每条信息都表示为一个提交日志，称为stream。每个stream都是存储在IPLD中的有向无环图 (DAG)，具有StreamID的不可变名称和StreamState的可验证状态。stream在概念上类似于Git tree，每个流都可以被视为自己的区块链、账本或事件日志。Tile Documents是一种Ceramic StreamType，经常用作身份数据（例如，个人资料、社交图、链接的社交帐户）、用户生成的内容（例如，博客文章、社交媒体）、DID文档等。\n\n该协议不依赖于任何特定的区块链。相反，它可以被概念化为“文档链”，其中验证特定文档的状态只需要用户同步文档的数据。用户不需要像大多数区块链网络（比特币、以太坊）那样同步整个网络状态。\n\nCeramic的一个关键工具是IDX，这是一种跨链身份协议，它提供了一个统一的存储库，所有应用程序都可以在其中注册和发现与用户的DID关联的数据。它可以被认为是一个去中心化的用户表。\n\n因此，IDX允许用户控制他们的身份和数据，而无需锁定任何单个应用程序，并轻松保护和跨应用程序移植他们的数据。同时，它允许开发人员构建数据丰富的应用程序，而无需强迫用户在每个应用程序上重新创建相同的数据。\n\n**（1）Sharded execution environment — 分片式执行环境**\n\n传统的区块链系统的可扩展性被限制在一个单一的全球虚拟执行环境（VM），并且单一节点的账本的状态在所有节点之间共享。\n\n与此不同的是，每个Ceramic节点作为一个单独的执行环境，用于执行计算和验证流的交易（这意味着没有全局账本）。这种\"内置的\"执行分片方法使Ceramic网络能够横向扩展，随着网络上节点数量的增加，可以对越来越多的同时进行的流交易进行并行处理。\n\n这样的设计能处理的数据规模比金融区块链上所需的吞吐量要大几个数量级。同时这种设计的另一个好处是，Ceramic Network的节点可以在离线的环境中执行数据流的交易，然后在它重新上线后与网络的其他部分的节点们同步更新。\n\n**（2）Global namespace — 全局的命名空间**\n\n由于所有的节点都是同一个Ceramic网络的一部分，Ceramic上的每一个流都存在于一个单一的全局命名空间中，它可以被任何其他节点访问或被任何其他数据流所引用。这创造了一个开放源码信息的公共数据网。\n\nCeramic的特性使静态文件能够被重组成高阶可变的数据结构，进而能够被编程为任何所需的形式，并且把结果的状态存储和复制在一个去中心化的节点网络中。Ceramic通过使用一个通用的去中心化内容计算基底，建立并扩展了IPFS文件系统和底层持久性网络，以及去中心化生态系统中的其他开放标准。\n\n**（3）Stream数据流存储实现方式概述：**\n\n系统中用户唯一的身份标识被定义为DID（去中心化的身份ID decentralized identifier）。系统使用将DID对应的所有数据流Stream信息以NoSQL的形式进行处理、存储、管理。存储信息有下面几种类型：\n\n1、Tile Document，存储JSON文件。可以被用作身份数据（档案、社交图、声誉分数、社交账户链接）、用户生成的内容（博客文章、社交媒体等）、以及聚合索引以形成集合和用户表（IDX）、DID文档、可验证的索赔等数据库替代。Tile Document仅依靠DID进行验证，对流的所有有效更新必须由控制该流的DID签署，也就是说，更新这些信息必须要用户手动授权才能完成。\n\n2、CAIP-10 Link，关联用户在任何平台和区块链上的钱包地址。它存储了一个可加密验证的身份证明，将一个区块链地址与一个DID联系起来。一个DID可以有无限数量的CAIP-10链接，将其与许多不同的区块链网络上的许多不同地址绑定。CAIP-10链接的管理也依靠DID进行验证，与Tile Document相同。\n\n3、自定义类型。除了上述2种默认类型，用户/开发者还可以自定义StreamType，并且并将其部署到自己的Ceramic Network节点。\n\n**（4）Stream数据流的授权管理方法：**\n\n1、3ID DID Method通常用于普通用户的账户。主要使用Ceramic的Tile Document 的StreamType来表示一个动态的DID文件。当3ID与IDX和3ID钥匙链结合使用时（如3ID Connect中实现的那样），一个3ID可以很容易地与任何L1或L2网络的任何数量的区块链账户进行控制。这提供了一种在所有其他平台上统一用户身份的方法。\n\n2、Key DID Method。通常用于开发者账户。一种从任何Ed25519密钥对静态生成的DID方法。密钥DID是轻量级的，但缺点是它的DID文件是不可改变的，如果它被破坏，没有能力重置密钥。\n\n3、NFT DID Method（即将推出）。用NFT的所有权作为认证，只能被其当前拥有者控制的方法。用CAIP-10 Link追踪到NFT的当前拥有者，被控制权会随当NFT的所有权发生变化时而改变。是一个适用于任何区块链上的任何NFT的DID方法。DID文件是由链上数据静态生成的。\n\n4、Safe DID Method（即将推出）。通常用于团队组织、DAO和其他多重签名钱包的实体。在任何区块链上的通过Gnosis多重签名钱包才可以控制的方法。\n\n**（5）网络中节点的职责：**\n\n1、上述的根据数据流类型的逻辑执行数据流交易。（核心职责）\n\n2、StreamState数据流状态存储。一个Ceramic节点只为它所关心的数据流保存数据流状态，这种维护过程称为 \"pinning（钉住）\"。不同的节点将为不同的数据流维护状态，但多个节点可以维护一个数据流的状态。\n\n3、提交日志存储。一个Ceramic节点维护一份它所pinning的数据流所有提交的交易的本地副本。\n\n4、持久性接口（Persistence connectors）。Ceramic节点可以选择利用一个额外的持久性存储后端来备份它正在钉住的数据流的交易。包括Filecoin、Arweave、Sia等持久性网络。\n\n5、查询响应。节点对来自客户端的流查询做出响应。如果节点有钉住数据流，它将返回响应；如果没有，它将通过libp2p向网络的其他部分询问流，然后返回响应。\n\n6、广播交易。当一个Ceramic节点成功地在一个数据流上执行了一个交易，它就会通过libp2p向网络的其他部分广播这个交易，这样其他同样钉住这个数据流的节点就可以更新他们的数据流状态来记录这个新的交易。\n\nCeramic是DID技术堆栈中的关键。一些建立在Ceramic网络并已经具有吸引力和市场契合度的项目包括：\n\n1、Boardroom：DAO的治理管理平台，使用Ceramic的平台存储提案。\n\n2、Rabbithole：通过允许人们赚取积分和加密货币来鼓励人们使用Web3项目的应用程序。Rabbithole使用Ceramic的网络将多个Web2和Web3帐户链接到一个统一的跨链DID中，并允许用户的声誉跨越其他Web3应用程序。\n\n3、ArcX：一个去中心化的应用程序，通过发行“DeFi护照”来提供链上信用评分和身份。\n\n**六 、总结与展望**\n\n微软的首席身份架构师Kim Cameron曾说，“互联网是没有身份层的”，因为互联网的寻址系统基于识别网络上的物理端点(机器)，而人并不是网络上的端点。因此，互联网没有办法唯一地识别人的身份。\n\n区块链技术的发展，帮助人们重新思考身份识别和认证的解决方案，通过使用去中心化标识符、可验证声明等技术来解决互联网身份层缺失的困境。\n\n同时，在微软、Facebook等互联网巨头的推动下，基于区块链技术的去中心化身份管理系统，将会是区块链技术应用落地最早的领域之一。\n\n相比传统数字身份系统，**去中心化数字身份具有隐私保护、可控安全、持久可用、分散化等特点，**基于属性的授权访问方式能够更好的支持开放环境下灵活的访问策略。短短几年时间，已取得了丰富的规范和技术标准化研究成果。\n\n随着标准化成果的继续拓展，未来越来越多的应用可方便、安全的切换到分布式数字身份基础设施上来，形成互联互通的互联网身份网络。\n\n随着互联网价值的涌现，我们需要强大的DID解决方案引入新的用例、来让Web3成为主流。虽然于早期阶段，但未来是光明的。并且由于DID标准的可组合性和互通性，每个新型应用带来的能量具有涟漪效应。\n\n我们预计DID解决方案将在未来几年内迅速走入大众视野，并开启Web3应用程序的下一个周期。\n\n**免责声明：本文分享内容仅作学习交流，不构成任何投资建议。**", "timestamp": 1654769880, "digest": "F3AroTTo1cgxnr8NtyJXRfP43JisZ4zjvtW2sbkP270", "contributor": "0x251C9aBcF97B5135C7eB68D1B0E0f0C8D2e48ea2"}

\n ** \n \n\n**خوب حالا نکته اول و دوم رو باید ترکیب کنیم یعنی ترکیب سیبیل اتک با خزانه 60%یی.**\n\nنکته بسیار مهم اینجاست که بعد از طی کردن مراحل جلوگیری سیبیل اتک در این پروژه ،  همچنان این پروژه  در معرض نوعی دیگه از سیبل اتک قرار داره\n\nهمون طور که گفتیم 60%ساپلای در اختیار 6% هست و این انگیزه وجود داره که با داشتن حداقل 3%از ساپلای یعنی 30میلیون توکن به خزانه 60%یی دست پیدا کرد. تصور کنید حداقل قیمتی که در پیش بینی  \n تحلیلگر توییتری المپیو وجود داره هر توکن هاپ پروتکل قیمت بخوره! چه اتفاقی میوفته؟ \n  \n \n\n![https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v554bv-bL8lS6wuPC4FlN.jpg?height=875&width=1200)\n\n \n \n\nدر سناریوی الیمپیو حداقل قیمت در نظر گرفته شده برای این توکن 0.28دلار،  با توجه به ساپلای 6%یی یعنی  17میلیون دلار مارکت کپ، که  با نصف این مقدار یعنی حداقل  3% امکان دسترسی به منابع خزانه وجود داره اما چون ممکنه سیبیل اتکر با مارکت میکر در رقابت بیوقته ما همون 17میلیون دلار رو در نظر میگیریم تا افزایش قیمت حاصل از رقابت برای خرید نصف توکن ها هم محاسبه بشه‌. یعنی با 17میلیون دلار در این سناریو امکان نابود کردن یکی از بزرگترین بریج های بازار وجود داره یعنی تمام تلاش تیم در بحث سیبیل اتک به سخره گرفته بشه.  \n به نظرم که مارکت میکر و بازار بسیار بعیده که اجازه همچین اتفاق مرگباری بده.چون در اصل شما به ازای هر واحد توکن هوپ ده واحد از حق رای خزانه رو هم در دست دارید که خودتون خبر ندارید.\n\nحالا به نظر شما با همچین وضعیتی تا حداقل چه تارگت هایی منطقی هست تا خزانه هم در امان باشه؟\n\nاین سناریو بالا رو همچنان با پیش بینی قیمت های بعدی  المپیو تکرار کنید تا به عدد منطقی برسید. یعنی حداقل توکن رو 86سنت و 1.5. 2.82 در نظر بگیرید و ببنید تا کجا و کدام عدد منطقی هست!؟ \n \n\nاما تحلیل و نظر شخصی خودم که می‌تونه کاملا نقض بشه،  در بدترین حالت ممکن قیمتی،  برای توکن  هاپ پروتکل سقف قیمتی که این تحلیلگر ارایه داده، میشه حداقل قیمت مد نظر من!\n\nیعنی کم ترین قیمتی که این توکن می‌تونه داشته باشه حدود 3-2دلار هست که با این تفاسیر مارکت کپ 180دلاری که  مختص 6%ساپلای در ظاهر اما  66%ساپلای در باطن هست میرسیم، که اگر هر توکن رو ما  \n تقسیم مارکت کپ درگردش اولیه کنیم به این شکل درمیاد\n\n180M$/60M$ Hop token= 3$ \n  \n **180M$/ 660M $hop = 0.27$** \n  \n Fully Diluted Valuation = 270M $ \n\nمیشه 27سنت \n \nکه در اصل میرسیم به همون پیش بینی قیمتی اولیه و بدبینانه الیمپیو اما با قیمت 3دلار در بازار آزاد 😅\n\nجالب شد نه؟! \n  \n خوب اگه 180 میلیون دلار هم در نظر بگیریم برای یکی از بزرگترین بریج های اتریومی با 100میلیون  . \n نقدینگی قفل شده واقعا ظلمه و اول کار به نظر زیر قیمت میشه  \n  \n  من مارکت کپ اولیه رو تقریبا دوبرابر حالت قبل درنظر میگیرم   \n حالا بریم مجدد حساب کنیم \n 300M$/60M hop token = 5 $ per $hop  \n  \n **300M$/660M=0.45 $**  \n  \n FDV = 450M$ \n  \n 5 دلار منطقی به نظر میرسه \n اما همچنان جا داره \n  \n حالا هیجان کار رو بیشتر کنیم ببینیم اگه خوشبین باشیم به چه اعدادی میرسیم؟ \n  \n  \n 540M$/60M $HOP token = 9$ per token \n  \n **500M$/660M $ hop token = 0.81$** \n  \n FDV= 810M$ \n  \n نظر من رو میخواید همچنان جا داره اگر که ارزشگذاری کل توکن ها رو بدین شکل حساب کنیم \n  \n 900M$/60M $hop = 15 $  \n  \n **900M$ /660M$ = 1.36$** \n  \n FDV = 1.36B$ \n ** \n حالا من یک تمرین به شما میدم شما انجام بدید و تارگت نهایی رو طبق محسابه خودم برام کامنت کنید  \n المپیو ارزشگذاری کل رو 2.82 میلیارد در نظر گرفت  \n به نظر شما با توجه به 6% ساپلای چه قیمتی میتونه توکن در بازار ازاد طبق روشی که محسابه شده کشف بشه ؟** \n  \n خوب تا همینجا کافیه، دوست ندارم در این شرایط بازار خیلی تارگت بالا ببرم و سطح قضاوت رو بالا ببرم \n  . من فقط اینجا با اعداد بر اساس تحلیل های خودم  و شرایط موجود بازی میکنم. \n تمام محسابات میتونه به زیبایی نقض بشه و حتما در نقض شدن تحلیل رو در نظر بگیرید. خصوصا اینکه بازار در لبه تیغ قرار داره. \n  \n اعداد بالاتر هم اگر چه  در دسترس هستند  اما شما این اعداد رو خودتون محاسبه کنید و بالا ببرید و به تارگت های دیگه برسید  \n پس به طور خلاصه  \n  \n **Minimum Price : 2-3$  \n Expected Price :4-5$  \n Optimistic Price :7-9$**  \n **Hopium Target : $15 or More** \n  \n در نظر داشته باشید که الزامی نداره قیمت های 4 تا 15 دلار رو در لحظه اول ببینه. بلکه میتونه در کوتاه   مدت به این تارگت ها برسه ولی انتظار دارم در هر حالتی در اول کار حداقل 2-3 دلار هر توکن قیمت بخوره بعد اونجا تصمیم بگیره که چه برنامه ای در چنته داره. پس اگر تصمیم دارید کاملا بفروشید طی دو پله میتونید اقدام به این کار کنید. اما اگر قصد هولد کردن بخشی یا تمام توکن ها رو دارید پیشنهاد میکنم حتما توکن ها رو دلیگیت کنید یا خودتون شخصا در فروم فعال باشید. اگر فرصت فعالیت ندارید یا توانایی ندارید میتونید توکن ها رو به شخصی مثل من هم دلیگیت کنید تا من به جای شما در حق رای ها شرکت کنم. هیچ الزامی به این کار نیست شما هر کسی دیگه رو میتونید نماینده خودتون در این مساله میتونید بذارید اما پیشنهاد میکنم اگر حتی همه ی توکن ها رو قصد دارید بفروشید ، یک دونه ته والت بذارید و دلیگیت کنید. \n ادرس من برای deligate : Mohammadmehdi.eth \n دقت کنید که برای دلیگیت کردن شما نیاز به ارسال توکن به من نیستید. \n  \n  امیدوارم این مقاله برای شما مفید بوده \n  اگر مفید بود میتونید با کالکت کردن این مقاله خودتون در معرض ایردراپ میرور هم قرار بدید و در عین حال دونیت هم کرده باشید.  \n جا داره نشکری کنم از  اقا رضا ، دوست حرفه ای و هم استانی خودم که در این پروژه سر نخ های خوبی به من داد \n ", "timestamp": 1654773664, "digest": "4qtd6IlJalHrygtBfHPlSEZnkbCKDOHWJiT99-j3SzI", "contributor": "0x5F367BF126FDa56D88BA88a8978D5496c66B3569"}

协作平台Melos又有新活动了，这次Melos 邀请大家一起来玩一场融合了GameFi、Mint、NFT、质押挖矿、Lottory彩票等热门元素的超爽游戏！最终获胜者将赢得超级大奖，所有参与者也能通过玩游戏获得奖励和收益！\n\n游戏的玩法很简单，我有幸受邀参与内测先睹为快，下面我就带大家操作一遍。\n\n**我们先来做好准备工作：**\n\n在电脑上安装好谷歌浏览器+MetaMask小狐狸钱包，创建或导入BSC钱包。\n\n**在BSC钱包里添加Melos的合约地址：**\n\n0x3CC194Cb21E3B9d86dD516b4d870B82fAfb4C02E\n\n[https://bscscan.com/token/0x3CC194Cb21E3B9d86dD516b4d870B82fAfb4C02E](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3CC194Cb21E3B9d86dD516b4d870B82fAfb4C02E)\n\n然后在钱包里存入一些Melos代币，当然还需要同时存入少量BNB代币作为矿工费。\n\n获取Melos代币很简单，目前Melos已经上线了很多主流数字币交易所，例如以下这些，我本人比较喜欢KuCoin。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*O2TEgEKa_FGiecPj)\n\n目前Melos的价格大约为0.15USDT，在游戏中mint一个NFT需要512个Melos，所以你至少要购买512个Melos（价值约76.8U），当然玩过类似彩票游戏的朋友都懂，为了赢得最后的胜利，你可能需要多次mint，所以，钱包里的Melos自然是多多益善。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*FPlzAKUuD-DrQybn)\n\n买到Melos后，通过BSC链提现到MetaMask小狐狸钱包里，同时别忘提取少许BNB到钱包里作为矿工费，一切准备就绪，下面咱们就开始玩激动人心的NFT彩票游戏了！\n\n复制如下地址到浏览器打开：\n\n**[https://melos.finance](https://melos.finance/)**\n\n提示：游戏内测刚刚结束，正式一轮游戏可能尚未启动，如您进入网站后还未启动，请关注项目方官方社交媒体通知的正式启动时间，文末有官方社交媒体地址。现在先带着大家领略一遍游戏玩法过程吧。\n\n点击首页右上角的Connect Wallet 连接钱包，在弹出的钱包窗口签名确认：\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*wjNoIj_6lwTQBV0S)\n\n如下图，右上角会显示你的BSC钱包地址代表连接成功，注意看下图中Your wallet 字样下方有个小按钮Bridge，点击它可以进入跨链桥，因为Melos已经实现跨链，所以如果你有ETH链上的Melos代币，可以通过这个跨链桥，跨链到BSC链上。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*L4PRaQi73Sg4ZjJe)\n\n下图就是跨链桥的界面，在这里你需要先切换到ETH链才能进行跨链操作，将以太坊链上的Melos资产跨链转移到BSC链上。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1204/0\\*35z-y8zzvWJrZPDM)\n\n好了，回到游戏首页，看下图找到 Game NFT Stage1 这里，点击Mint 开始铸造NFT，参加游戏：\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1334/0\\*2c4Y0OGC3Xh5Ci3l)\n\nMint的过程需要确认两次，第一次是授权阶段，如下图所示：\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1338/0\\*AtLy-zzwAv2xbWSf)\n\n在弹出的钱包窗口上点击Confirm 确认：\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/844/0\\*KzTBZGL0GZBl1f1t)\n\n然后Mint 进入第二步正式 Mint 阶段：\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1316/0\\*9sKDzRcKI3-7UVDp)\n\n再次在弹出的钱包签名窗口上点击Confirm 确认，两次确认都需要消耗少量的BNB作为矿工费：\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/852/0\\*_e7cecm3OAQ98o3P)\n\n交易成功后，看下图 Your Game NFTs 下面就显示出你刚铸造的 NFT，你正式进入了奖池的竞争中，你将随机获得三种 style 之一的 NFT，如果连续 12 小时没有人 mint，则最后一次 mint 的用户获胜，游戏结束。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*7moX-DsnCHPNqBW5)\n\n**最后的大奖是这样分配的：**\n\n大家投入mint的MELOS代币的50%直接烧毁，剩余 50%MELOS中的60%发给最后一次mint的获胜者 。\n\n与最后一次 mint 的 NFT style（风格）相同的用户们，一起平分剩余 50%MELOS中的40%，所以就算没有获胜的用户也可能会分到一定的奖金，你铸造的NFT数量越多，自然 style（风格）也越多，越可能拥有与最后一次mint一样的NFT，分到的奖金也就越多，这段话有点绕，大家实际玩一下再好好体会一下，就明白了。\n\n注意看上图，玩这个游戏，你需要时时关注上图中的两个地方，一个是倒计时，每当有人mint一次后，这个倒计时就会从12小时重新开始倒计时，如果倒计时结束，再无人mint，那么最后一次mint的人就获胜了，所以你要注意这里，及时mint保持自己是最后一个mint的人，才能最终获胜。\n\n还有一个地方要注意，就是上图中 minted by 后面的钱包地址，看清楚是不是你的，如果不是要注意及时mint 保持领先位置。\n\n下图就是三种 style 的NFT，注意右边 In Progress 下面显示的就是目前大家参与游戏的Melos代币总量的50%，也就是大家最终可以瓜分的奖金数量。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*P6lF9jBZovNr6PxN)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*sbxiJmyGT-au_7Y9)\n\n那么游戏会不会陷入“无限循环”总是不结束呢？大家不必担心，游戏的设计者早已考虑到这点，所以为游戏设置了如下规则：\n\n**在整个铸造过程中，对 $MELOS 代币的需求将会逐渐增加：**\n\n**第 1 次到第 10 次铸造，每次需要 512 $MELOS。**\n\n**第 11 至 20 次铸造，每次需要 537.6 ( 512\\*(1+5%)) $MELOS。**\n\n**第 21 至 30 次铸造，每次需要 564.48 ( 512\\*(1+5%)\\*(1+5%)) $MELOS。**\n\n**后续铸造过程以此类推。**\n\n**当最后一个人铸造 NFT 时，如果仍然没有人铸造 NFT，则铸造过程将在 12 小时后结束, 当铸币过程自然结束时，奖池将被封存。**\n\n**在铸币过程中花费的 $MELOS 奖池的 50% 被烧掉，剩余的 50% 奖池将归铸币过程的获胜者所有。**\n\n以此类推，随着阶梯不断升高，所需Melos数量不断增大，直至大家望而却步，游戏自然终止，而最后一个mint的人就是幸运儿，将积累的巨量奖金收入囊中。\n\n好啦，经过漫长的角逐，这一轮游戏终于决出胜负了，看下图，显示钱包尾号为C879的这个用户最终获胜，赢得了16650 个 Melos代币！哈哈，这只是一次短时间的游戏测试，真实的游戏最后积累的代币数量绝对不止这些！\n\n这次获胜者最后mint 的一个NFT的 style 是Rock，所以拥有41个 Rock 的NFT的用户们平分了剩余的奖金11100 个Melos代币。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*7YVAV472I7tHM655)\n\n我没能成为最终的胜利者获得大奖，但是我也有3个Rock 的NFT，所以我也分到了812.2个 Melos代币，也不错，点击下图的 Claim 领取奖金，奖金直接进入我的BSC钱包里。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*-pz3qOA-1f_NHCNj)\n\n先别离开，游戏还没结束呢，刚才咱们玩了Game NFT 的 Stage1，也就是第一轮游戏，下面我们还要继续玩 Stage2 第二轮游戏，向下看网页，如下图所示，在 Game NFT Stage2 这里，点击 Choose NFT\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/876/0\\*cVrbF0SBpAzI9yVA)\n\n在弹出的窗口中，你刚才在第一轮游戏中mint的NFT 都会显示出来，点击NFT右上角的勾选，选中一个NFT，然后点击 Confirm 确认。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1266/0\\*ItsQYc4xTpGGQDOJ)\n\n然后点击下图中的 Staking 质押NFT\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/888/0\\*Ep4F1IYw_6WRNmEQ)\n\n质押也要确认两次钱包签名，一次是 授权，一次是确认质押，同样需要消耗少量BNB做矿工费：\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*JSq4bGQDBD0ErSFv)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/856/0\\*Fj8_fM1kQAtJCZrP)\n\n看下图，重复刚才的质押过程，就可以把你在第一轮获得的 NFT 全部质押进池子，持续质押60天，结束后即可按质押天数领取 APR 360% 的收益，质押期间不可取出，不得不说这个收益率还是很高的。而且让人觉得这个NFT Game Staking游戏还挺有人情味，即便不能获得最终的大奖，但是通过玩游戏也会有不少收益，特别是很好地融合了当下火热的NFT元素，让游戏更具趣味性和吸引力。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*irlATbxRgIChJ-Ut)\n\n等到最终质押时间结束，看上图右边Earned下面就会显示你最终的质押挖矿收益，当Claim 按钮变绿就可以点击收取Melos 存入钱包了。\n\n好啦，游戏的玩法讲完了，你学会了吗？新一轮游戏马上就要开始了，祝大家都玩得开心，边玩边赚！人生能有几回搏，此时不搏更待何时？！大奖在向你招手，朋友们一起冲！\n\n**注意，新一轮游戏开启时间请大家关注以下项目方官方渠道通知：**\n\nOffical website:

(درمورد کلیات هاپ پروتکل و معماری اون اگر درخواست بود میتونید زیر پست توییتری بپرسید تا در اولیت ساخت قرار بگیره).\n\n[اما توی این مقاله که به درخواست خیلی از دوستان نوشته میشه قراره یک سری نکات مربوط به توکنومیک و در نهایت استراتژی های پیشنهادی فروش صحبت بشه، چون تخمین قیمت هم حتی اگه داده بشه فایده ی خاصی نداره چون صحبت های ما قدرتی در اثر گذاری رو قیمت ندارند و در نهایت قیمت کشف شده در  بازار](https://twitter.com/mehdi_eth/status/1528283835196227586?s=20&t=WVgTPnx87fCLK5IHU8khXA) مهمه\n\nتوی بخش اول می‌خوام نحوه محاسبه ی غلطی که در تصور خیلی ها ، حتی در بین کمیونیتی های خارجی هست صحبت کنم و در ادامه بگم که تمام نکات و ابعاد این پروژه در بحث ارزشگذاری در نظر گرفته نشده‌.\n\nخوب اول من جزییات توکنومیک رو برای شما مطرح میکنم و بعد نکات رو بگیم\n\n![Total Supply: 1 bilion $HOP tokenAirdrop: 8% ( 6% in circulation at TGE)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zg7ZHenZro660VjL1G8cJ.png?height=424&width=720)\n\nبه جز 6%ایردراپ و خزانه مابقی توکن ها حداقل یک سال قفل هستن و بعد طبق یک برنامه ازاد سازی چند ساله در بازار ازاد میشن.\n\n[خوب با جزئیات بالا مدلی که همه معمولا حساب میکنند به این شکل هست که ساپلای اولیه در گردش که حدود 6% هست + مارکت کپ حدودی رو هم با توجه به رقبا به دست میارن و تقسیم بر توکن های در گردش اولیه میکنند و به یک عدد میرسند که درنهایت میزان خطای بسیار بالایی داره و اینطور میشه که سطح انتظارات بالا/پایین می‌ره و وقتی که قیمت توکن در مارکت کشف شد برای خیلی از دوستان ضد حال میشه.  نمونه این محسابه رو میتونید اینجا مشاهده کنید]().\n\n[https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19](https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19)\n\n🟠در این جا نوع محاسبه  مثل خیلی از جاهای دیگه 6% ساپلای اولیه در نظر گرفته شده و سقف قیمتی که برای این توکن در نظر گرفته شده حدود 3دلار هست با ارزشگذاری کلی حدود 2.8میلیارد دلار\n\n\\*\\*نکته اول\n\\*\\*\n\n🟢اما چیزی که خیلی جاها  به اون توجه نمیشه  بخش  خرانه این پروژه هست. این خرانه که حدود 60%ساپلای رو به خودش اختصاص داده، یک مقدار سرمایه ای بر حسب توکن هاپ هست که در زمان نیاز با توجه به رای کمیونیتی به منظور توسعه پروژه تصویب و در نهایت خرج میشه و الان این خزانه 60% در اختیار گروهی هست که 6%ساپلای ایردراپ به اونها تعلق میگیره. یک بار دیگه مرور کنیم خوب جا بیوفته ، 🟣60% در اختیار 6%🟣 (درست عین منابع مملکت ما که همش دست یک عده خاصی هستن، خدا لعنتشون کنه)\n\nیعنی در واقع ساپلای درگردش اصلی اولیه این پروژه  66% میشه که ما اونو ساپلای باطنی در نظر میگیریم.\n\nالبته نکته ای که هست  اینه که توکن ها با اینکه تماما آزاد یا آنلاک  هستند اما در بازار آزاد وجود ندارند و باید با تصویب کمیونیتی آزاد بشن. این مسأله رو گوشه ذهنتون داشته باشید تا مورد بعد رو بررسی کنیم و درنهایت به جمع بندی برسیم.\n\n**نکته دوم**\n\n🔵مورد بعدی بحث همیشگی سیبیل اتک هست هست که در این پروژه یک [بدعت گذاری جدیدی ارایه شد](https://twitter.com/lifiprotocol/status/1531200233413103617?t=PUeILQDGIbJCLEBgkObTWw&s=19) و موفق شد بر خلاف سایر پروژه ها همچون پاراسوپ ، به درصد موفقیت بسیار بالایی در حذف ایردراپ هانتر ها و سیبیل اتکر ها دست پیدا کنه. شخصا با توجه به مواردی که در سایر پروژه ها دیدم و گزارشاتی که در آنالیز این نوع والت ها داده شد باید بگم که ایردراپ هانتر ها پیشرفته ترین و ماهرانه ترین روش ها رو با والت های پر بار انتخاب کرده و به این پروژه حمله کردند و تیم هاپ پروتکل با مکانیزم های ترکیبی همچون محدودیت تعداد تراکنش، و حجم معاملاتی حداقل 1000دلاری ، همچنین درخواست از کمیونیتی و ارایه بانتی و جایزه برای پیدا کردن این افراد که برای هر پروژه ای آفت محسوب میشن ، به زیبایی موفق شد از یک چالش سخت ، سر بلند بیرون بیاد( البته بسیار ناراحت شدم که تعداد زیادی از کمیونیتی ایرانی حداقل شرایط لازم برای دریافت رو نداشتند اما تیم از این نظر چاره ای نداشت).\nنمونه این گزارش های پشم ریزون رو بینید تا به موفقیت هاپ در پیدا کردن افراد دیوس پی ببرید.\n\n[https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris/status/1525178626563420160](https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris/status/1525178626563420160)\n\nبحث سیبیل اتک اونقدر در این پروژه پر رنگ بود که فاندر پروژه اونو از یک حمله ساده به یک صنعت تشبیه کرد. کافیه توییت بالا رو بخونید تا متوجه پیشرفتگی کار بشید.\n\n**ایردراپ افزایشی**\n\nنکته جالب و جدیدی دیگه در این پروژه وجود داشت، ایردراپ افزایشی بود که هرچه تعداد سیبیل اتکر های بیشتری شناخته میشد ، توکن های این افراد به دست کمیونیتی برگردانده  میشد و شما میدیدید که توکن های ایردراپی شما روزانه در حال افزایش هست.  از اونجایی که کمیونیتی واقعی کمتر تمایل به فروش این توکن ها دارند ، طبیعتاً فشار فروش کمتری رو نسبت به قبل باید باید شاهد باشیم.\n\n\\*\\*پس نتیجه گیری از این موضوع: موفقیت در چالش جدی به وجود اومده برای این پروژه و در نهایت ارزشگذاری بالاتر به واسطه موفقیت تیم  و کمیونیتی هاپ پروتکل!\n\\*\\*\n\n**خوب حالا نکته اول و دوم رو باید ترکیب کنیم یعنی ترکیب سیبیل اتک با خزانه 60%یی.**\n\nنکته بسیار مهم اینجاست که بعد از طی کردن مراحل جلوگیری سیبیل اتک در این پروژه ،  همچنان این پروژه  در معرض نوعی دیگه از سیبل اتک قرار داره\n\nهمون طور که گفتیم 60%ساپلای در اختیار 6% هست و این انگیزه وجود داره که با داشتن حداقل 3%از ساپلای یعنی 30میلیون توکن به خزانه 60%یی دست پیدا کرد. تصور کنید حداقل قیمتی که در پیش بینیتحلیلگر توییتری المپیو وجود داره هر توکن هاپ پروتکل قیمت بخوره! چه اتفاقی میوفته؟\n\n![https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v554bv-bL8lS6wuPC4FlN.jpg?height=875&width=1200)\n\nدر سناریوی الیمپیو حداقل قیمت در نظر گرفته شده برای این توکن 0.28دلار،  با توجه به ساپلای 6%یی یعنی  17میلیون دلار مارکت کپ، که  با نصف این مقدار یعنی حداقل  3% امکان دسترسی به منابع خزانه وجود داره اما چون ممکنه سیبیل اتکر با مارکت میکر در رقابت بیوقته ما همون 17میلیون دلار رو در نظر میگیریم تا افزایش قیمت حاصل از رقابت برای خرید نصف توکن ها هم محاسبه بشه‌. یعنی با 17میلیون دلار در این سناریو امکان نابود کردن یکی از بزرگترین بریج های بازار وجود داره یعنی تمام تلاش تیم در بحث سیبیل اتک به سخره گرفته بشه.به نظرم که مارکت میکر و بازار بسیار بعیده که اجازه همچین اتفاق مرگباری بده.چون در اصل شما به ازای هر واحد توکن هوپ ده واحد از حق رای خزانه رو هم در دست دارید که خودتون خبر ندارید.\n\nحالا به نظر شما با همچین وضعیتی تا حداقل چه تارگت هایی منطقی هست تا خزانه هم در امان باشه؟\n\nاین سناریو بالا رو همچنان با پیش بینی قیمت های بعدی  المپیو تکرار کنید تا به عدد منطقی برسید. یعنی حداقل توکن رو 86سنت و 1.5. 2.82 در نظر بگیرید و ببنید تا کجا و کدام عدد منطقی هست!؟\n\nاما تحلیل و نظر شخصی خودم که می‌تونه کاملا نقض بشه،  در بدترین حالت ممکن قیمتی،  برای توکن  هاپ پروتکل سقف قیمتی که این تحلیلگر ارایه داده، میشه حداقل قیمت مد نظر من!\n\nیعنی کم ترین قیمتی که این توکن می‌تونه داشته باشه حدود 3-2دلار هست که با این تفاسیر مارکت کپ 180دلاری که  مختص 6%ساپلای در ظاهر اما  66%ساپلای در باطن هست میرسیم، که اگر هر توکن رو ماتقسیم مارکت کپ درگردش اولیه کنیم به این شکل درمیاد\n\n180M$/60M$ Hop token= 3$\n\n**180M$/ 660M $hop = 0.27$**\n\nFully Diluted Valuation = 270M $\n\nمیشه 27سنت\n\nکه در اصل میرسیم به همون پیش بینی قیمتی اولیه و بدبینانه الیمپیو اما با قیمت 3دلار در بازار آزاد 😅\n\nجالب شد نه؟!\n\nخوب اگه 180 میلیون دلار هم در نظر بگیریم برای یکی از بزرگترین بریج های اتریومی با 100میلیون  .\nنقدینگی قفل شده واقعا ظلمه و اول کار به نظر زیر قیمت میشه\n\nمن مارکت کپ اولیه رو تقریبا دوبرابر حالت قبل درنظر میگیرمحالا بریم مجدد حساب کنیم\n300M$/60M hop token = 5 $ per $hop\n\n**300M$/660M=0.45 $**\n\nFDV = 450M$\n\n5 دلار منطقی به نظر میرسه\nاما همچنان جا داره\n\nحالا هیجان کار رو بیشتر کنیم ببینیم اگه خوشبین باشیم به چه اعدادی میرسیم؟\n\n540M$/60M $HOP token = 9$ per token\n\n**500M$/660M $ hop token = 0.81$**\n\nFDV= 810M$\n\nنظر من رو میخواید همچنان جا داره اگر که

میتونید اقدام به این کار کنید. اما اگر قصد هولد کردن بخشی یا تمام توکن ها رو دارید پیشنهاد میکنم حتما توکن ها رو دلیگیت کنید یا خودتون شخصا در فروم فعال باشید. اگر فرصت فعالیت ندارید یا توانایی ندارید میتونید توکن ها رو به شخصی مثل من هم دلیگیت کنید تا من به جای شما در حق رای ها شرکت کنم. هیچ الزامی به این کار نیست شما هر کسی دیگه رو میتونید نماینده خودتون در این مساله میتونید بذارید اما پیشنهاد

It is designed as an *objective competition* and attracts *financially motivated players* to compete amongst themselves. The winner wins the right to become the next leader and decide the next accepted list of transactions.\n\nThanks to cryptography, the leader election competition is objectively fair to all participants and it is publicly verifiable such that anyone can check the network’s rules were adhered too.

All transactions carry a fee (or tip) and this is used to decide the priority of transactions for ordering. It is expected the block producer will maximise their profit and order transactions that pay a higher fee first.\n\nTo avoid any misconceptions, block producers DO NOT in ANY WAY run or control the network:\n\n* Block producers are **NOT** responsible for enforcing consensus rules.\n* Block producers **CANNOT** change the consensus rules.\n\nIt is a very simple, narrow and well-defined role. They are financially rewarded for providing a good quality of ordering service. It is decentralization that forces block producers to adhere to the rules. If they propose a block that breaks the rules, then the economic majority rejects it and the block producer will forfeit their reward.\n\n## How do we decide who can become a block producer?\n\nIt is important that all block producers can eventually converge and agree that a proposed block is part of the canonical chain. \n\nThe need for collective agreement impacts who can be a block producer. While the goal is to keep it an open-membership group, we must avoid allowing parties to join who can disrupt the process and make it difficult for the block producers to converge on the canonical chain.\n\n![There is no real-world registration process or strong notion of identity. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LuE_HPyo6BJKR9Idg7a69.png?height=768&width=1116)\n\nThe leader election protocol must have a sybil-resistance mechanism to identify and limit who can participate in the leader election. This is tricky as there is no strong notion of identity on the internet. It is very easy for an individual to create one, two, or several identities. While there are some fun protocols for [Proof of Personhood](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/27/an-internet-for-humans-proof-of-personhood-explained/), there is no realistic way to restrict participation based on identity alone.\n\n### Proof of X.\n\nThe solution is to pick block producers based on their ownership of a scarce and financially expensive resource to acquire. We call this Proof of X as the participant must prove they own the asset X before they can participate as a block producer.  It leads to *a weak notion of identity* as it is linked to the resource and the participant can remain pseudonymous.\n\nTwo prominent examples include:\n\n* **Proof of Work.** Prove computational power under your control by producing the solution to a difficult puzzle (ownership of electricity and hardware efficiency).\n* **Proof of Stake.** Prove ownership of a set of coins.\n\nIn both cases, there is a limited supply of the resource and it is financially expensive to acquire it. The side-effect of Proof of X is that it can help align the financial incentives of all participants to protect the long-term health of the system. If they deivate from the honest protocol, it can detrimental their investment.\n\n> **Misconception:** Proof of X has nothing to do with transaction throughput. It only serves as a way to identify who is participating in the leader election for ordering transactions.\n\n### Classical vs Nakamoto: Registering and picking the leader\n\nMany consensus protocols rely on a sub-protocol, the leader election protocol, to pick a leader who has the power to make a single decision on behalf of the group. It has two components: \n\n* **Registering participants.** Deciding who is allowed to participate in the leader election protocol,\n* **Picking the leader.** All participants agree on the new leader for a single round.\n\nThe core innovation by Satoshi Nakamoto was to replace how participants could register for the process and how this impacts picking the leader. \n\n**Classical consensus.** Participant selection is an easy problem to solve. A trusted admin can curate the list of candidates and install it into the system. Once a list of candidates is available and well-known, it is fairly straight-forward to decide who can be the next leader.  For example, a round-robin style protocol can be implemented to allow each participant to take it in turn to become the leader. [AWS has a nice writeup](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/leader-election-in-distributed-systems/) on the pros and cons of a leader election protocol for distributed systems.\n\n**Nakamoto Consensus.** There is no trusted admin who can curate a potential list of candidates. The magic is to allow participants to register and self-appoint themselves to the list. This is achieved with Proof of X as it forms a weak notion of identity and it allows us to replace the trusted admin altogether with an open-market that allows anyone to compete. Especially in proof of work, as participant’s do not need to publicly signal their intent to participate until they are picked as the leader (paradoxically).\n\n### Example: Bitcoin’s proof of work\n\nWe consider the leader election protocol in Bitcoin’s proof of work (after all, it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto). Let’s walk through it step by step.\n\n**Registration process.** A potential block producer must acquire hardware, a source of cost-effective electricity and ultimately a competitive mining facility. This registration process occurs **in meat-space** (there is no in-protocol transcript) and there is no need for competitors to signal in a public manner their intent to compete. The meat-space nature is important for Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. Even if 99% of all participants are kicked offline in the next round, the remaining 1% block producers can continue to create new blocks and allow the network to progress. Over time, new participants can acquire hardware, register to participate, and eventually contribute to the transaction ordering service.\n\n**Picking the next leader.** Each participant competes in a private lottery and the first to find the winning ticket is picked as the next leader. On average, across all rounds, leaders are picked proportionally based on their financial investment relative to other participants. This is interesting, especially since the total capital investment is not publicly declared and there is no list of active participants.\n\nThis may appear paradoxical at first -- how can we fairly distribute the right to be a leader to a list of participants without knowing their identity and stake in the system up front?\n\n![Proof of work is similar to lottery scratch cards. Your chances of winning depends on how fast you can find a winning ticket compared to your competitors.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iNj5_r5GZCa8Yykw1ojDb.jpeg?height=650&width=975)\n\nThis is the magic of *a scratch-off lottery ticket style* leader election. The task is straight-forward. Competitors scratch-off lottery tickets as fast as they can to be the first one to find a winning ticket. Once found, they broadcast the winning ticket to all active participants to prove they have won the competition and now have the right to produce the next block.\n\nThe scratch-off lottery ticket competition must be objective and not offer an advantage to any other competitors. The only way to outperform is for the competitor to scratch off tickets faster than the other competitors. In Bitcoin, this is accomplished as the winning lottery ticket is to find a hash with a prefix of N zeroes:\n\n```\n000000000abc... = hash(block_header, r). \n```\n\nPut another way, computing the block hash is the equivalent for scratching off the lottery ticket. If the hash is not a winning ticket, then the competitor picks a new random factor (r) and tries again. Thanks to the properties of a cryptographic hash function, the only way for a competitor to increase their chances of winning is to compute hashes faster than others.\n\n## Can we identify block producers? \n\n![Proportion of miners on Bitcoin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SSzs_JBAzOwT9pnq_bkjM.png?height=1004&width=2294)\n\nIt is common for block producers to tag blocks with an identity. This makes it easy for an external observer to track the distribution of participants who are competing. \n\nHistorical records show that at any time there is typically 2-4 agents who represent a majority of Bitcoin’s computational power. It is possible for block producers to collude, and if so, they only have the power to censor or reverse recently confirmed transactions. They cannot dictate or change the rules which govern the network\n\n![GHash achieved 51% of the network's computational power for a short period of time. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MZ2ISL6g7qUs67dWebDi3.png?height=776&width=1920)\n\nWe should be cautious to declare a block producer as a single entity. In most cases, a block producer is a collection of smaller miners who are pooling their resources together to propose a single block. This is called a “pool” as people can work together towards a common goal. If the “pool” misbehaves or gets too big, then it is common for smaller miners to join a competing pool. [GHash is the textbook example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io) as they amassed a majority of the computational power in July 2014, but this only lasted for a short period of time. The pool lost influence over time and they no longer exist. \n\nNakamoto Consensus is secure as long as agents do not collude and achieve a majority ownership of the scarce resource (in this case, computational power). At the same time, it is common practice for smaller miners to pool resources and work together to form a single block producer. The collusion-resistance property of Bitcoin’s proof of work can only be demonstrated with empirical evidence. Miners will work together as long as they do not achieve a majority. Perhaps, this is because it will undermine the competitive market and ultimately the price of Bitcoin. \n\n## Why are the block producers honest?\n\n![The financial incentive not to attack the system is discussed in the Bitcoin paper. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fipMMBB76iTPZ1sEeKcZc.png?height=404&width=1610)\n\nA network like Bitcoin is only sustainable if the block producers have a strong financial motivation to honestly follow the protocol. Alongside the need to have skin-in-the-game with a significant financial investment, it is crucial to consider the long-term business model for block producers. This includes the capital/operation cost alongside their sources of revenue.\n\nIt should go without saying, but the venture of a block producer only works if the revenue can cover the costs to participate and ultimately return a profit. There is a lot of subtle details in regards to the sustainability of block producers, especially since Bitcoin and Ethereum have adopted very different approaches to the same problem.\n\nOur next blog post will cover the sustainability of block producers, the fee market, and minimal viable issuance. If you want to know more now, you can watch [Lecture 4](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cryptocurrency-class-2022/6) or the wonderful [Q&A session on Fee Market Sustainability](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cryptocurrency-class-2022/7).\n\n*p.s., Distributed systems literature calls the process a leader election, but in reality it is a competition to become the leader.

It only serves as a way to identify who is participating in the leader election for ordering transactions.\n\n### Classical vs Nakamoto: Registering and picking the leader\n\nMany consensus protocols rely on a sub-protocol, the leader election protocol, to pick a leader who has the power to make a single decision on behalf of the group. It has two components: \n\n* **Registering participants.** Deciding who is allowed to participate in the leader election protocol,\n* **Picking the leader.** All participants agree on the new leader for a single round.\n\nThe core innovation by Satoshi Nakamoto was to replace how participants could register for the process and how this impacts picking the leader. \n\n**Classical consensus.** Participant selection is an easy problem to solve. A trusted admin can curate the list of candidates and install it into the system. Once a list of candidates is available and well-known, it is fairly straight-forward to decide who can be the next leader.  For example, a round-robin style protocol can be implemented to allow each participant to take it in turn to become the leader. [AWS has a nice writeup](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/leader-election-in-distributed-systems/) on the pros and cons of a leader election protocol for distributed systems.\n\n**Nakamoto Consensus.** There is no trusted admin who can curate a potential list of candidates. The magic is to allow participants to register and self-appoint themselves to the list. This is achieved with Proof of X as it forms a weak notion of identity and it allows us to replace the trusted admin altogether with an open-market that allows anyone to compete. Especially in proof of work, as participant’s do not need to publicly signal their intent to participate until they are picked as the leader (paradoxically).\n\n### Example: Bitcoin’s proof of work\n\nWe consider the leader election protocol in Bitcoin’s proof of work (after all, it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto). Let’s walk through it step by step.\n\n**Registration process.** A potential block producer must acquire hardware, a source of cost-effective electricity and ultimately a competitive mining facility. This registration process occurs **in meat-space** (there is no in-protocol transcript) and there is no need for competitors to signal in a public manner their intent to compete. The meat-space nature is important for Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. Even if 99% of all participants are kicked offline in the next round, the remaining 1% block producers can continue to create new blocks and allow the network to progress. Over time, new participants can acquire hardware, register to participate, and eventually contribute to the transaction ordering service.\n\n**Picking the next leader.** Each participant competes in a private lottery and the first to find the winning ticket is picked as the next leader. On average, across all rounds, leaders are picked proportionally based on their financial investment relative to other participants. This is interesting, especially since the total capital investment is not publicly declared and there is no list of active participants.\n\nThis may appear paradoxical at first -- how can we fairly distribute the right to be a leader to a list of participants without knowing their identity and stake in the system up front?\n\n![Proof of work is similar to lottery scratch cards. Your chances of winning depends on how fast you can find a winning ticket compared to your competitors.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iNj5_r5GZCa8Yykw1ojDb.jpeg?height=650&width=975)\n\nThis is the magic of *a scratch-off lottery ticket style* leader election. The task is straight-forward. Competitors scratch-off lottery tickets as fast as they can to be the first one to find a winning ticket. Once found, they broadcast the winning ticket to all active participants to prove they have won the competition and now have the right to produce the next block.\n\nThe scratch-off lottery ticket competition must be objective and not offer an advantage to any other competitors. The only way to outperform is for the competitor to scratch off tickets faster than the other competitors. In Bitcoin, this is accomplished as the winning lottery ticket is to find a hash with a prefix of N zeroes:\n\n```\n000000000abc... = hash(block_header, r). \n```\n\nPut another way, computing the block hash is the equivalent for scratching off the lottery ticket. If the hash is not a winning ticket, then the competitor picks a new random factor (r) and tries again. Thanks to the properties of a cryptographic hash function, the only way for a competitor to increase their chances of winning is to compute hashes faster than others.\n\n## Can we identify block producers? \n\n![Proportion of miners on Bitcoin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SSzs_JBAzOwT9pnq_bkjM.png?height=1004&width=2294)\n\nIt is common for block producers to tag blocks with an identity. \n\nThis makes it easy for an external observer to track the distribution of participants who are competing. Historical records show that at any time there is typically 2-4 agents who represent a majority of Bitcoin’s computational power. It is possible for block producers to collude, and if so, they only have the power to censor or reverse recently confirmed transactions. They cannot dictate or change the rules which govern the network\n\n![GHash achieved 51% of the network's computational power for a short period of time. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MZ2ISL6g7qUs67dWebDi3.png?height=776&width=1920)\n\nWe should be cautious to declare a block producer as a single entity. In most cases, a block producer is a collection of smaller miners who are pooling their resources together to propose a single block. This is called a “pool” as people can work together towards a common goal. If the “pool” misbehaves or gets too big, then it is common for smaller miners to join a competing pool. [GHash is the textbook example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io) as they amassed a majority of the computational power in July 2014, but this only lasted for a short period of time. The pool lost influence over time and they no longer exist. \n\nNakamoto Consensus is secure as long as agents do not collude and achieve a majority ownership of the scarce resource (in this case, computational power). At the same time, it is common practice for smaller miners to pool resources and work together to form a single block producer. The collusion-resistance property of Bitcoin’s proof of work can only be demonstrated with empirical evidence. Miners will work together as long as they do not achieve a majority. Perhaps, this is because it will undermine the competitive market and ultimately the price of Bitcoin. \n\n## Why are the block producers honest?\n\n![The financial incentive not to attack the system is discussed in the Bitcoin paper. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fipMMBB76iTPZ1sEeKcZc.png?height=404&width=1610)\n\nA network like Bitcoin is only sustainable if the block producers have a strong financial motivation to honestly follow the protocol. Alongside the need to have skin-in-the-game with a significant financial investment, it is crucial to consider the long-term business model for block producers. This includes the capital/operation cost alongside their sources of revenue.\n\nIt should go without saying, but the venture of a block producer only works if the revenue can cover the costs to participate and ultimately return a profit. There is a lot of subtle details in regards to the sustainability of block producers, especially since Bitcoin and Ethereum have adopted very different approaches to the same problem.\n\nOur next blog post will cover the sustainability of block producers, the fee market, and minimal viable issuance.

This is interesting, especially since the total capital investment is not publicly declared and there is no list of active participants.\n\nThis may appear paradoxical at first -- how can we fairly distribute the right to be a leader to a list of participants without knowing their identity and stake in the system up front?\n\n![Proof of work is similar to lottery scratch cards. Your chances of winning depends on how fast you can find a winning ticket compared to your competitors.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iNj5_r5GZCa8Yykw1ojDb.jpeg?height=650&width=975)\n\nThis is the magic of *a scratch-off lottery ticket style* leader election. The task is straight-forward. Competitors scratch-off lottery tickets as fast as they can to be the first one to find a winning ticket. Once found, they broadcast the winning ticket to all active participants to prove they have won the competition and now have the right to produce the next block.\n\nThe scratch-off lottery ticket competition must be objective and not offer an advantage to any other competitors. The only way to outperform is for the competitor to scratch off tickets faster than the other competitors. In Bitcoin, this is accomplished as the winning lottery ticket is to find a hash with a prefix of N zeroes:\n\n```\n000000000abc... = hash(block_header, r). \n```\n\nPut another way, computing the block hash is the equivalent for scratching off the lottery ticket. If the hash is not a winning ticket, then the competitor picks a new random factor (r) and tries again. Thanks to the properties of a cryptographic hash function, the only way for a competitor to increase their chances of winning is to compute hashes faster than others.\n\n## Can we identify block producers? \n\n![Proportion of miners on Bitcoin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SSzs_JBAzOwT9pnq_bkjM.png?height=1004&width=2294)\n\nIt is common for block producers to tag blocks with an identity. \n\nThis makes it easy for an external observer to track the distribution of participants who are competing. Historical records show that at any time there is typically 2-4 agents who represent a majority of Bitcoin’s computational power. It is possible for block producers to collude, and if so, they only have the power to censor or reverse recently confirmed transactions. They cannot dictate or change the rules which govern the network\n\n![GHash achieved 51% of the network's computational power for a short period of time. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MZ2ISL6g7qUs67dWebDi3.png?height=776&width=1920)\n\nWe must be cautious to declare a block producer as a single entity. In most cases, a block producer is a collection of smaller miners who are pooling their resources together to propose a single block. This is called a “pool” and in proof of work it is a “mining pool”. If the “pool” misbehaves or gets too big, then smaller miners can leave and join a competing pool. [GHash is the textbook example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io) as they amassed a majority of the computational power in July 2014. This only lasted for a short period of time and eventually the pool lost influence to the point it no longer exists.\n\n## Why are the block producers honest?\n\n![The financial incentive not to attack the system is discussed in the Bitcoin paper. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fipMMBB76iTPZ1sEeKcZc.png?height=404&width=1610)\n\nThe security of Bitcoin (and Ethereum) relies on appointing block producers who have a strong financial incentive to honestly follow the protocol. To help this alignment, we have witnessed that block producers require a significant financial investment before they can participate. However, to help sustain the security of the network, it is crucial to consider the long-term business model for block producers. \n\nIt should go without saying, but the venture of a block producer only works if the revenue can cover the costs to participate and ultimately return a profit. There is a lot of subtle details in regards to the sustainability of block producers, especially since Bitcoin and Ethereum have adopted very different approaches to the same problem.\n\nOur next blog post will cover the sustainability of block producers, the fee market, and minimal viable issuance. If you want to know more now, you can watch [Lecture 4](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cryptocurrency-class-2022/6) or the wonderful [Q&A session on Fee Market Sustainability](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cryptocurrency-class-2022/7).\n\n*p.s., Distributed systems literature calls the process a leader election, but in reality it is a competition to become the leader.

{"id": "6B09-STl5FsTUT86hBQqZhf2EEy2KA0JxESeNcVqadY", "title": "Who are the block producers?", "body": "At heart, all early e-cash protocols had to find and appoint a broker to support the issuance (and redemption) of coins. However, the search for an appropriate broker plagued and hindered the adoption of e-cash. There are many reasons for financial institutions to avoid taking on the role including:\n\n* Regulatory red tape,\n* Financial and reputation risk,\n* Lack of understanding or appeal  (“why not credit cards?”).\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto’s core innovation was to replace an appointed broker with an open-membership group (“the block producers”). He implemented a leader election protocol to allow anyone to register and self-appoint themselves to the group. It is designed as an *objective competition* and attracts *financially motivated players* to compete amongst themselves. The winner wins the right to become the next leader and decide the next accepted list of transactions.\n\nThanks to cryptography, the leader election competition is objectively fair to all participants and it is publicly verifiable such that anyone can check the network’s rules were adhered too. There is no need to blindly trust any participant in the open-membership group. We only need to trust that they will participate in the process and afterwards we can verify their actions. The *[trust, but verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify)* paradigm.\n\nAs you can imagine, the design by Satoshi Nakamoto was radically different to any leader election protocol proposed for the past 30 years. It has opened a new frontier of research for a topic that was typically considered *dull* and *mostly* *complete*.\n\n### Transaction ordering service\n\n![Block producers are only responsible for collecting pending transactions and deciding their final order of execution. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3gnX8KgDAigbNhUWsdIbu.png?height=926&width=1450)\n\nCollectively, the block producers offers a single service:\n\n* **Transaction ordering service.** Decide the final order of transactions for execution.\n\nA list of pending transactions can be collected from the peer to peer network (memory pool) or it can be directly sent to the block producer. All transactions carry a fee (or tip) and this is used to decide the priority of transactions for ordering. It is expected the block producer will maximise their profit and order transactions that pay a higher fee first.\n\nTo avoid any misconceptions, block producers DO NOT in ANY WAY run or control the network:\n\n* Block producers are **NOT** responsible for enforcing consensus rules.\n* Block producers **CANNOT** change the consensus rules.\n\nIt is a very simple, narrow and well-defined role. They are financially rewarded for providing a good quality of ordering service. It is decentralization that forces block producers to adhere to the rules. If they propose a block that breaks the rules, then the economic majority rejects it and the block producer will forfeit their reward.\n\n## How do we decide who can become a block producer?\n\nIt is important that all block producers can eventually converge and agree that a proposed block is part of the canonical chain. \n\nThe need for collective agreement impacts who can be a block producer. While the goal is to keep it an open-membership group, we must avoid allowing parties to join who can disrupt the process and make it difficult for the block producers to converge on the canonical chain.\n\n![There is no real-world registration process or strong notion of identity. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LuE_HPyo6BJKR9Idg7a69.png?height=768&width=1116)\n\nThe leader election protocol must have a sybil-resistance mechanism to identify and limit who can participate in the leader election. This is tricky as there is no strong notion of identity on the internet. It is very easy for an individual to create one, two, or several identities. While there are some fun protocols for [Proof of Personhood](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/27/an-internet-for-humans-proof-of-personhood-explained/), there is no realistic way to restrict participation based on identity alone.\n\n### Proof of X.\n\nThe solution is to pick block producers based on their ownership of a scarce and financially expensive resource to acquire. We call this Proof of X as the participant must prove they own the asset X before they can participate as a block producer.  It leads to *a weak notion of identity* as it is linked to the resource and the participant can remain pseudonymous.\n\nTwo prominent examples include:\n\n* **Proof of Work.** Prove computational power under your control by producing the solution to a difficult puzzle (ownership of electricity and hardware efficiency).\n* **Proof of Stake.** Prove ownership of a set of coins.\n\nIn both cases, there is a limited supply of the resource and it is financially expensive to acquire it. The side-effect of Proof of X is that it can help align the financial incentives of all participants to protect the long-term health of the system. If they deivate from the honest protocol, it can detrimental their investment.\n\n> **Misconception:** Proof of X has nothing to do with transaction throughput. It only serves as a way to identify who is participating in the leader election for ordering transactions.\n\n### Classical vs Nakamoto: Registering and picking the leader\n\nMany consensus protocols rely on a sub-protocol, the leader election protocol, to pick a leader who has the power to make a single decision on behalf of the group. It has two components: \n\n* **Registering participants.** Deciding who is allowed to participate in the leader election protocol,\n* **Picking the leader.** All participants agree on the new leader for a single round.\n\nThe core innovation by Satoshi Nakamoto was to replace how participants could register for the process and how this impacts picking the leader. \n\n**Classical consensus.** Participant selection is an easy problem to solve. A trusted admin can curate the list of candidates and install it into the system. Once a list of candidates is available and well-known, it is fairly straight-forward to decide who can be the next leader.  For example, a round-robin style protocol can be implemented to allow each participant to take it in turn to become the leader. [AWS has a nice writeup](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/leader-election-in-distributed-systems/) on the pros and cons of a leader election protocol for distributed systems.\n\n**Nakamoto Consensus.** There is no trusted admin who can curate a potential list of candidates. The magic is to allow participants to register and self-appoint themselves to the list. This is achieved with Proof of X as it forms a weak notion of identity and it allows us to replace the trusted admin altogether with an open-market that allows anyone to compete. Especially in proof of work, as participant’s do not need to publicly signal their intent to participate until they are picked as the leader (paradoxically).\n\n### Example: Bitcoin’s proof of work\n\nWe consider the leader election protocol in Bitcoin’s proof of work (after all, it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto). Let’s walk through it step by step.\n\n**Registration process.** A potential block producer must acquire hardware, a source of cost-effective electricity and ultimately a competitive mining facility. This registration process occurs **in meat-space** (there is no in-protocol transcript) and there is no need for competitors to signal in a public manner their intent to compete. The meat-space nature is important for Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. Even if 99% of all participants are kicked offline in the next round, the remaining 1% block producers can continue to create new blocks and allow the network to progress. Over time, new participants can acquire hardware, register to participate, and eventually contribute to the transaction ordering service.\n\n**Picking the next leader.** Each participant competes in a private lottery and the first to find the winning ticket is picked as the next leader. On average, across all rounds, leaders are picked proportionally based on their financial investment relative to other participants. This is interesting, especially since the total capital investment is not publicly declared and there is no list of active participants.\n\nThis may appear paradoxical at first -- how can we fairly distribute the right to be a leader to a list of participants without knowing their identity and stake in the system up front?\n\n![Proof of work is similar to lottery scratch cards.

صحبت کنم و در ادامه بگم که تمام نکات و ابعاد این پروژه در بحث ارزشگذاری در نظر گرفته نشده‌.\n\nخوب اول من جزییات توکنومیک رو برای شما مطرح میکنم و بعد نکات رو بگیم\n\n![Total Supply: 1 bilion $HOP tokenAirdrop: 8% ( 6% in circulation at TGE)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zg7ZHenZro660VjL1G8cJ.png?height=424&width=720)\n\nبه جز 6%ایردراپ و خزانه مابقی توکن ها حداقل یک سال قفل هستن و بعد طبق یک برنامه ازاد سازی چند ساله در بازار ازاد میشن.\n\n[خوب با جزئیات بالا مدلی که همه معمولا حساب میکنند به این شکل هست که ساپلای اولیه در گردش که حدود 6% هست + مارکت کپ حدودی رو هم با توجه به رقبا به دست میارن و تقسیم بر توکن های در گردش اولیه میکنند و به یک عدد میرسند که درنهایت میزان خطای بسیار بالایی داره و اینطور میشه که سطح انتظارات بالا/پایین می‌ره و وقتی که قیمت توکن در مارکت کشف شد برای خیلی از دوستان ضد حال میشه.  نمونه این محسابه رو میتونید اینجا مشاهده کنید]().\n\n[https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19](https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19)\n\n🟠در این جا نوع محاسبه  مثل خیلی از جاهای دیگه 6% ساپلای اولیه در نظر گرفته شده و سقف قیمتی که برای این توکن در نظر گرفته شده حدود 3دلار هست با ارزشگذاری کلی حدود 2.8میلیارد دلار\n\n\\*\\*نکته اول\n\\*\\*\n\n🟢اما چیزی که خیلی جاها  به اون توجه نمیشه  بخش  خرانه این پروژه هست. این خرانه که حدود 60%ساپلای رو به خودش اختصاص داده، یک مقدار سرمایه ای بر حسب توکن هاپ هست که در زمان نیاز با توجه به رای کمیونیتی به منظور توسعه پروژه تصویب و در نهایت خرج میشه و الان این خزانه 60% در اختیار گروهی هست که 6%ساپلای ایردراپ به اونها تعلق میگیره. یک بار دیگه مرور کنیم خوب جا بیوفته ، 🟣60% در اختیار 6%🟣 (درست عین منابع مملکت ما که همش دست یک عده خاصی هستن، خدا لعنتشون کنه)\n\nیعنی در واقع ساپلای درگردش اصلی اولیه این پروژه  66% میشه که ما اونو ساپلای باطنی در نظر میگیریم.\n\nالبته نکته ای که هست  اینه که توکن ها با اینکه تماما آزاد یا آنلاک  هستند اما در بازار آزاد وجود ندارند و باید با تصویب کمیونیتی آزاد بشن. این مسأله رو گوشه ذهنتون داشته باشید تا مورد بعد رو بررسی کنیم و درنهایت به جمع بندی برسیم.\n\n**نکته دوم**\n\n🔵مورد بعدی بحث همیشگی سیبیل اتک هست هست که در این پروژه یک [بدعت گذاری جدیدی ارایه شد](https://twitter.com/lifiprotocol/status/1531200233413103617?t=PUeILQDGIbJCLEBgkObTWw&s=19) و موفق شد بر خلاف سایر پروژه ها همچون پاراسوپ ، به درصد موفقیت بسیار بالایی در حذف ایردراپ هانتر ها و سیبیل اتکر ها دست پیدا کنه. شخصا با توجه به مواردی که در سایر پروژه ها دیدم و گزارشاتی که در آنالیز این نوع والت ها داده شد باید بگم که ایردراپ هانتر ها پیشرفته ترین و ماهرانه ترین روش ها رو با والت های پر بار انتخاب کرده و به این پروژه حمله کردند و تیم هاپ پروتکل با مکانیزم های ترکیبی همچون محدودیت تعداد تراکنش، و حجم معاملاتی حداقل 1000دلاری ، همچنین درخواست از کمیونیتی و ارایه بانتی و جایزه برای پیدا کردن این افراد که برای هر پروژه ای آفت محسوب میشن ، به زیبایی موفق شد از یک چالش سخت ، سر بلند بیرون بیاد( البته بسیار ناراحت شدم که تعداد زیادی از کمیونیتی ایرانی حداقل شرایط لازم برای دریافت رو نداشتند اما تیم از این نظر چاره ای نداشت).\nنمونه این گزارش های پشم ریزون رو بینید تا به موفقیت هاپ در پیدا کردن افراد دیوس پی ببرید.\n\n[https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris/status/1525178626563420160](https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris/status/1525178626563420160)\n\nبحث سیبیل اتک اونقدر در این پروژه پر رنگ بود که فاندر پروژه اونو از یک حمله ساده به یک صنعت تشبیه کرد. کافیه توییت بالا رو بخونید تا متوجه پیشرفتگی کار بشید.\n\n**ایردراپ افزایشی**\n\nنکته جالب و جدیدی دیگه در این پروژه وجود داشت، ایردراپ افزایشی بود که هرچه تعداد سیبیل اتکر های بیشتری شناخته میشد ، توکن های این افراد به دست کمیونیتی برگردانده  میشد و شما میدیدید که توکن های ایردراپی شما روزانه در حال افزایش هست.  از اونجایی که کمیونیتی واقعی کمتر تمایل به فروش این توکن ها دارند ، طبیعتاً فشار فروش کمتری رو نسبت به قبل باید باید شاهد باشیم.\n\n\\*\\*پس نتیجه گیری از این موضوع: موفقیت در چالش جدی به وجود اومده برای این پروژه و در نهایت ارزشگذاری بالاتر به واسطه موفقیت تیم  و کمیونیتی هاپ پروتکل!\n\\*\\*\n\n**خوب حالا نکته اول و دوم رو باید ترکیب کنیم یعنی ترکیب سیبیل اتک با خزانه 60%یی.**\n\nنکته بسیار مهم اینجاست که بعد از طی کردن مراحل جلوگیری سیبیل اتک در این پروژه ،  همچنان این پروژه  در معرض نوعی دیگه از سیبل اتک قرار داره\n\nهمون طور که گفتیم 60%ساپلای در اختیار 6% هست و این انگیزه وجود داره که با داشتن حداقل 3%از ساپلای یعنی 30میلیون توکن به خزانه 60%یی دست پیدا کرد. تصور کنید حداقل قیمتی که در پیش بینیتحلیلگر توییتری المپیو وجود داره هر توکن هاپ پروتکل قیمت بخوره! چه اتفاقی میوفته؟\n\n![https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v554bv-bL8lS6wuPC4FlN.jpg?height=875&width=1200)\n\nدر سناریوی الیمپیو حداقل قیمت در نظر گرفته شده برای این توکن 0.28دلار،  با توجه به ساپلای 6%یی یعنی  17میلیون دلار مارکت کپ، که  با نصف این مقدار یعنی حداقل  3% امکان دسترسی به منابع خزانه وجود داره اما چون ممکنه سیبیل اتکر با مارکت میکر در رقابت بیوقته ما همون 17میلیون دلار رو در نظر میگیریم تا افزایش قیمت حاصل از رقابت برای خرید نصف توکن ها هم محاسبه بشه‌. یعنی با 17میلیون دلار در این سناریو امکان نابود کردن یکی از بزرگترین بریج های بازار وجود داره یعنی تمام تلاش تیم در بحث سیبیل اتک به سخره گرفته بشه.به نظرم که مارکت میکر و بازار بسیار بعیده که اجازه همچین اتفاق مرگباری بده.چون در اصل شما به ازای هر واحد توکن هوپ ده واحد از حق رای خزانه رو هم در دست دارید که خودتون خبر ندارید.\n\nحالا به نظر شما با همچین وضعیتی تا حداقل چه تارگت هایی منطقی هست تا خزانه هم در امان باشه؟\n\nاین سناریو بالا رو همچنان با پیش بینی قیمت های بعدی  المپیو تکرار کنید تا به عدد منطقی برسید. یعنی حداقل توکن رو 86سنت و 1.5. 2.82 در نظر بگیرید و ببنید تا کجا و کدام عدد منطقی هست!؟\n\nاما تحلیل و نظر شخصی خودم که می‌تونه کاملا نقض بشه،  در بدترین حالت ممکن قیمتی،  برای توکن  هاپ پروتکل سقف قیمتی که این تحلیلگر ارایه داده، میشه حداقل قیمت مد نظر من!\n\nیعنی کم ترین قیمتی که این توکن می‌تونه داشته باشه حدود 3-2دلار هست که با این تفاسیر مارکت کپ 180دلاری که  مختص 6%ساپلای در ظاهر اما  66%ساپلای در باطن هست میرسیم، که اگر هر توکن رو ماتقسیم مارکت کپ درگردش اولیه کنیم به این شکل درمیاد\n\n180M$/60M$ Hop token= 3$\n\n**180M$/ 660M $hop = 0.27$**\n\nFully Diluted Valuation = 270M $\n\nمیشه 27سنت\n\nکه در اصل میرسیم به همون پیش بینی قیمتی اولیه و بدبینانه الیمپیو اما با قیمت 3دلار در بازار آزاد 😅\n\nجالب شد نه؟!\n\nخوب اگه 180 میلیون دلار هم در نظر بگیریم برای یکی از بزرگترین بریج های اتریومی با 100میلیون  .\nنقدینگی قفل شده واقعا ظلمه و اول کار به نظر زیر قیمت میشه\n\nمن مارکت کپ اولیه رو تقریبا دوبرابر حالت قبل درنظر میگیرمحالا بریم مجدد حساب کنیم\n300M$/60M hop token = 5 $ per $hop\n\n**300M$/660M=0.45 $**\n\nFDV = 450M$\n\n5 دلار منطقی به نظر میرسه\nاما همچنان جا داره\n\nحالا هیجان کار رو بیشتر کنیم ببینیم اگه خوشبین باشیم به چه اعدادی میرسیم؟\n\n540M$/60M $HOP token = 9$ per token\n\n**500M$/660M $ hop token = 0.81$**\n\nFDV= 810M$\n\nنظر من رو میخواید همچنان جا داره اگر که ارزشگذاری کل توکن ها رو بدین شکل حساب کنیم\n\n900M$/60M $hop = 15 $\n\n**900M$ /660M$ = 1.36$**\n\nFDV = 1.36B$\n\\*\\*\nحالا من یک تمرین به شما میدم شما انجام بدید و تارگت نهایی رو طبق محسابه خودم برام کامنت کنیدالمپیو ارزشگذاری کل رو 2.82 میلیارد در نظر گرفتبه نظر شما با توجه به 6% ساپلای چه قیمتی میتونه توکن در بازار ازاد طبق روشی که محسابه شده کشف بشه ؟\\*\\*\n\nخوب تا همینجا کافیه، دوست

(درمورد کلیات هاپ پروتکل و معماری اون اگر درخواست بود میتونید زیر پست توییتری بپرسید تا در اولیت ساخت قرار بگیره).\n\n[اما توی این مقاله که به درخواست خیلی از دوستان نوشته میشه قراره یک سری نکات مربوط به توکنومیک و در نهایت استراتژی های پیشنهادی فروش صحبت بشه، چون تخمین قیمت هم حتی اگه داده بشه فایده ی خاصی نداره چون صحبت های ما قدرتی در اثر گذاری رو قیمت ندارند و در نهایت قیمت کشف شده در  بازار](https://twitter.com/mehdi_eth/status/1528283835196227586?s=20&t=WVgTPnx87fCLK5IHU8khXA) مهمه\n\nتوی بخش اول می‌خوام نحوه محاسبه ی غلطی که در تصور خیلی ها ، حتی در بین کمیونیتی های خارجی هست صحبت کنم و در ادامه بگم که تمام نکات و ابعاد این پروژه در بحث ارزشگذاری در نظر گرفته نشده‌.\n\nخوب اول من جزییات توکنومیک رو برای شما مطرح میکنم و بعد نکات رو بگیم\n\n![Total Supply: 1 bilion $HOP tokenAirdrop: 8% ( 6% in circulation at TGE)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zg7ZHenZro660VjL1G8cJ.png?height=424&width=720)\n\nبه جز 6%ایردراپ و خزانه مابقی توکن ها حداقل یک سال قفل هستن و بعد طبق یک برنامه ازاد سازی چند ساله در بازار ازاد میشن.\n\n[خوب با جزئیات بالا مدلی که همه معمولا حساب میکنند به این شکل هست که ساپلای اولیه در گردش که حدود 6% هست + مارکت کپ حدودی رو هم با توجه به رقبا به دست میارن و تقسیم بر توکن های در گردش اولیه میکنند و به یک عدد میرسند که درنهایت میزان خطای بسیار بالایی داره و اینطور میشه که سطح انتظارات بالا/پایین می‌ره و وقتی که قیمت توکن در مارکت کشف شد برای خیلی از دوستان ضد حال میشه.  نمونه این محسابه رو میتونید اینجا مشاهده کنید]().\n\n[https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19](https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19)\n\n🟠در این جا نوع محاسبه  مثل خیلی از جاهای دیگه 6% ساپلای اولیه در نظر گرفته شده و سقف قیمتی که برای این توکن در نظر گرفته شده حدود 3دلار هست با ارزشگذاری کلی حدود 2.8میلیارد دلار\n\n**نکته اول**\n\n🟢اما چیزی که خیلی جاها  به اون توجه نمیشه  بخش  خرانه این پروژه هست. این خرانه که حدود 60%ساپلای رو به خودش اختصاص داده، یک مقدار سرمایه ای بر حسب توکن هاپ هست که در زمان نیاز با توجه به رای کمیونیتی به منظور توسعه پروژه تصویب و در نهایت خرج میشه و الان این خزانه 60% در اختیار گروهی هست که 6%ساپلای ایردراپ به اونها تعلق میگیره. یک بار دیگه مرور کنیم خوب جا بیوفته ، 🟣60% در اختیار 6%🟣 (درست عین منابع مملکت ما که همش دست یک عده خاصی هستن، خدا لعنتشون کنه)\n\nیعنی در واقع ساپلای درگردش اصلی اولیه این پروژه  66% میشه که ما اونو ساپلای باطنی در نظر میگیریم.\n\nالبته نکته ای که هست  اینه که توکن ها با اینکه تماما آزاد یا آنلاک  هستند اما در بازار آزاد وجود ندارند و باید با تصویب کمیونیتی آزاد بشن. این مسأله رو گوشه ذهنتون داشته باشید تا مورد بعد رو بررسی کنیم و درنهایت به جمع بندی برسیم.\n\n**نکته دوم**\n\n🔵مورد بعدی بحث همیشگی سیبیل اتک هست هست که در این پروژه یک [بدعت گذاری جدیدی ارایه شد](https://twitter.com/lifiprotocol/status/1531200233413103617?t=PUeILQDGIbJCLEBgkObTWw&s=19) و موفق شد بر خلاف سایر پروژه ها همچون پاراسوپ ، به درصد موفقیت بسیار بالایی در حذف ایردراپ هانتر ها و سیبیل اتکر ها دست پیدا کنه. شخصا با توجه به مواردی که در سایر پروژه ها دیدم و گزارشاتی که در آنالیز این نوع والت ها داده شد باید بگم که ایردراپ هانتر ها پیشرفته ترین و ماهرانه ترین روش ها رو با والت های پر بار انتخاب کرده و به این پروژه حمله کردند و تیم هاپ پروتکل با مکانیزم های ترکیبی همچون محدودیت تعداد تراکنش، و حجم معاملاتی حداقل 1000دلاری ، همچنین درخواست از کمیونیتی و ارایه بانتی و جایزه برای پیدا کردن این افراد که برای هر پروژه ای آفت محسوب میشن ، به زیبایی موفق شد از یک چالش سخت ، سر بلند بیرون بیاد( البته بسیار ناراحت شدم که تعداد زیادی از کمیونیتی ایرانی حداقل شرایط لازم برای دریافت رو نداشتند اما تیم از این نظر چاره ای نداشت).\nنمونه این گزارش های پشم ریزون رو بینید تا به موفقیت هاپ در پیدا کردن افراد دیوس پی ببرید.\n\n[https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris/status/1525178626563420160](https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris/status/1525178626563420160)\n\nبحث سیبیل اتک اونقدر در این پروژه پر رنگ بود که فاندر پروژه اونو از یک حمله ساده به یک صنعت تشبیه کرد. کافیه توییت بالا رو بخونید تا متوجه پیشرفتگی کار بشید.\n\n**ایردراپ افزایشی**\n\nنکته جالب و جدیدی دیگه در این پروژه وجود داشت، ایردراپ افزایشی بود که هرچه تعداد سیبیل اتکر های بیشتری شناخته میشد ، توکن های این افراد به دست کمیونیتی برگردانده  میشد و شما میدیدید که توکن های ایردراپی شما روزانه در حال افزایش هست.  از اونجایی که کمیونیتی واقعی کمتر تمایل به فروش این توکن ها دارند ، طبیعتاً فشار فروش کمتری رو نسبت به قبل باید باید شاهد باشیم.\n\n\\*\\*پس نتیجه گیری از این موضوع: موفقیت در چالش جدی به وجود اومده برای این پروژه و در نهایت ارزشگذاری بالاتر به واسطه موفقیت تیم  و کمیونیتی هاپ پروتکل!\n\\*\\*\n\n**خوب حالا نکته اول و دوم رو باید ترکیب کنیم یعنی ترکیب سیبیل اتک با خزانه 60%یی.**\n\nنکته بسیار مهم اینجاست که بعد از طی کردن مراحل جلوگیری سیبیل اتک در این پروژه ،  همچنان این پروژه  در معرض نوعی دیگه از سیبل اتک قرار داره\n\nهمون طور که گفتیم 60%ساپلای در اختیار 6% هست و این انگیزه وجود داره که با داشتن حداقل 3%از ساپلای یعنی 30میلیون توکن به خزانه 60%یی دست پیدا کرد. تصور کنید حداقل قیمتی که در پیش بینیتحلیلگر توییتری المپیو وجود داره هر توکن هاپ پروتکل قیمت بخوره! چه اتفاقی میوفته؟\n\n![https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1527739270789836800?t=_J2MaBLBezEqUvpF9rGDMw&s=19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v554bv-bL8lS6wuPC4FlN.jpg?height=875&width=1200)\n\nدر سناریوی الیمپیو حداقل قیمت در نظر گرفته شده برای این توکن 0.28دلار،  با توجه به ساپلای 6%یی یعنی  17میلیون دلار مارکت کپ، که  با نصف این مقدار یعنی حداقل  3% امکان دسترسی به منابع خزانه وجود داره اما چون ممکنه سیبیل اتکر با مارکت میکر در رقابت بیوقته ما همون 17میلیون دلار رو در نظر میگیریم تا افزایش قیمت حاصل از رقابت برای خرید نصف توکن ها هم محاسبه بشه‌. یعنی با 17میلیون دلار در این سناریو امکان نابود کردن یکی از بزرگترین بریج های بازار وجود داره یعنی تمام تلاش تیم در بحث سیبیل اتک به سخره گرفته بشه.به نظرم که مارکت میکر و بازار بسیار بعیده که اجازه همچین اتفاق مرگباری بده.چون در اصل شما به ازای هر واحد توکن هوپ ده واحد از حق رای خزانه رو هم در دست دارید که خودتون خبر ندارید.\n\nحالا به نظر شما با همچین وضعیتی تا حداقل چه تارگت هایی منطقی هست تا خزانه هم در امان باشه؟\n\nاین سناریو بالا رو همچنان با پیش بینی قیمت های بعدی  المپیو تکرار کنید تا به عدد منطقی برسید. یعنی حداقل توکن رو 86سنت و 1.5. 2.82 در نظر بگیرید و ببنید تا کجا و کدام عدد منطقی هست!؟\n\nاما تحلیل و نظر شخصی خودم که می‌تونه کاملا نقض بشه،  در بدترین حالت ممکن قیمتی،  برای توکن  هاپ پروتکل سقف قیمتی که این تحلیلگر ارایه داده، میشه حداقل قیمت مد نظر من!\n\nیعنی کم ترین قیمتی که این توکن می‌تونه داشته باشه حدود 3-2دلار هست که با این تفاسیر مارکت کپ 180دلاری که  مختص 6%ساپلای در ظاهر اما  66%ساپلای در باطن هست میرسیم، که اگر هر توکن رو ماتقسیم مارکت کپ درگردش اولیه کنیم به این شکل درمیاد\n\n180M$/60M$ Hop token= 3$\n\n**180M$/ 660M $hop = 0.27$**\n\nFully Diluted Valuation = 270M $\n\nمیشه 27سنت\n\nکه در اصل میرسیم به همون پیش بینی قیمتی اولیه و بدبینانه الیمپیو اما با قیمت 3دلار در بازار آزاد 😅\n\nجالب شد نه؟!\n\nخوب اگه 180 میلیون دلار هم در نظر بگیریم برای یکی از بزرگترین بریج های اتریومی با 100میلیون  .\nنقدینگی قفل شده واقعا ظلمه و اول کار به نظر زیر قیمت میشه\n\nمن مارکت کپ اولیه رو تقریبا دوبرابر حالت قبل درنظر میگیرمحالا بریم مجدد حساب کنیم\n300M$/60M hop token = 5 $ per $hop\n\n**300M$/660M=0.45 $**\n\nFDV = 450M$\n\n5 دلار منطقی به نظر میرسه\nاما همچنان جا داره\n\nحالا هیجان کار رو بیشتر کنیم ببینیم اگه خوشبین باشیم به چه اعدادی میرسیم؟\n\n540M$/60M $HOP token = 9$ per token\n\n**500M$/660M $ hop token = 0.81$**\n\nFDV= 810M$\n\nنظر من رو میخواید همچنان جا داره اگر که ارزشگذاری کل توکن ها رو بدین شکل حساب کنیم\n\n900M$/60M $hop = 15 $\n\n**900M$ /660M$ = 1.36$**\n\nFDV = 1.36B$\n\nحالا من یک تمرین به شما میدم شما انجام بدید و تارگت نهایی رو طبق محسابه خودم برام کامنت کنیدالمپیو ارزشگذاری کل رو 2.82 میلیارد در نظر گرفتبه نظر شما با توجه به 6% ساپلای چه قیمتی میتونه توکن در بازار ازاد طبق روشی که محسابه شده کشف بشه ؟\\*\\*\n\nخوب تا همینجا کافیه، دوست ندارم در این شرایط بازار خیلی تارگت بالا ببرم و سطح قضاوت رو بالا ببرم\n. من فقط اینجا با اعداد بر اساس تحلیل های خودم  و شرایط موجود بازی میکنم.\nتمام محسابات میتونه به زیبایی نقض بشه و حتما در نقض شدن تحلیل رو در نظر بگیرید. خصوصا اینکه بازار در لبه تیغ قرار داره.\n\nاعداد بالاتر هم اگر چه  در دسترس هستند  اما شما این اعداد رو خودتون محاسبه کنید و بالا ببرید و به تارگت های دیگه برسیدپس به طور خلاصه\n\n**Minimum Price : 2-3$ \n Expected Price :4-5$ \n Optimistic Price :7-9$ \n Hopium Target : $15 or More**\n\nدر نظر داشته باشید که الزامی نداره قیمت های 4 تا 15 دلار رو در لحظه اول ببینه. بلکه میتونه در کوتاه   مدت به این تارگت ها برسه ولی انتظار دارم در هر حالتی در اول کار حداقل 2-3 دلار هر توکن قیمت بخوره بعد اونجا تصمیم بگیره که چه برنامه ای در چنته داره. پس اگر تصمیم دارید کاملا بفروشید طی دو پله میتونید اقدام به این کار کنید. اما اگر قصد هولد کردن بخشی یا تمام توکن ها رو دارید پیشنهاد میکنم حتما توکن ها رو دلیگیت کنید یا خودتون شخصا در فروم فعال باشید. اگر فرصت فعالیت ندارید

{"id": "p5x_ANdsMK4GJS66KqECdLnvyiScBVOYokQAzz-ZHBs", "title": "Who are the block producers?", "body": "At heart, all early e-cash protocols had to find and appoint a broker to support the issuance (and redemption) of coins. However, the search for an appropriate broker plagued and hindered the adoption of e-cash. There are many reasons for financial institutions to avoid taking on the role including:\n\n* Regulatory red tape,\n* Financial and reputation risk,\n* Lack of understanding or appeal  (“why not credit cards?”).\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto’s core innovation was to replace an appointed broker with an open-membership group (“the block producers”). He implemented a leader election protocol to allow anyone to register and self-appoint themselves to the group. It is designed as an *objective competition* and attracts *financially motivated players* to compete amongst themselves. The winner wins the right to become the next leader and decide the next accepted list of transactions.\n\nThanks to cryptography, the leader election competition is objectively fair to all participants and it is publicly verifiable such that anyone can check the network’s rules were adhered too. There is no need to blindly trust any participant in the open-membership group. We only need to trust that they will participate in the process and afterwards we can verify their actions. The *[trust, but verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify)* paradigm.\n\nAs you can imagine, the design by Satoshi Nakamoto was radically different to any leader election protocol proposed for the past 30 years. It has opened a new frontier of research for a topic that was typically considered *dull* and *mostly* *complete*.\n\n### Transaction ordering service\n\n![Block producers are only responsible for collecting pending transactions and deciding their final order of execution. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3gnX8KgDAigbNhUWsdIbu.png?height=926&width=1450)\n\nCollectively, the block producers offers a single service:\n\n* **Transaction ordering service.** Decide the final order of transactions for execution.\n\nA list of pending transactions can be collected from the peer to peer network (memory pool) or it can be directly sent to the block producer. All transactions carry a fee (or tip) and this is used to decide the priority of transactions for ordering. It is expected the block producer will maximise their profit and order transactions that pay a higher fee first.\n\nTo avoid any misconceptions, block producers DO NOT in ANY WAY run or control the network:\n\n* Block producers are **NOT** responsible for enforcing consensus rules.\n* Block producers **CANNOT** change the consensus rules.\n\nIt is a very simple, narrow and well-defined role. They are financially rewarded for providing a good quality of ordering service. It is decentralization that forces block producers to adhere to the rules. If they propose a block that breaks the rules, then the economic majority rejects it and the block producer will forfeit their reward.\n\n## How do we decide who can become a block producer?\n\nIt is important that all block producers can eventually converge and agree that a proposed block is part of the canonical chain. \n\nThe need for collective agreement impacts who can be a block producer. While the goal is to keep it an open-membership group, we must avoid allowing parties to join who can disrupt the process and make it difficult for the block producers to converge on the canonical chain.\n\n![There is no real-world registration process or strong notion of identity. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LuE_HPyo6BJKR9Idg7a69.png?height=768&width=1116)\n\nThe leader election protocol must have a sybil-resistance mechanism to identify and limit who can participate in the leader election. This is tricky as there is no strong notion of identity on the internet. It is very easy for an individual to create one, two, or several identities. While there are some fun protocols for [Proof of Personhood](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/27/an-internet-for-humans-proof-of-personhood-explained/), there is no realistic way to restrict participation based on identity alone.\n\n### Proof of X.\n\nThe solution is to pick block producers based on their ownership of a scarce and financially expensive resource to acquire. We call this Proof of X as the participant must prove they own the asset X before they can participate as a block producer.  It leads to *a weak notion of identity* as it is linked to the resource and the participant can remain pseudonymous.\n\nTwo prominent examples include:\n\n* **Proof of Work.** Prove computational power under your control by producing the solution to a difficult puzzle (ownership of electricity and hardware efficiency).\n* **Proof of Stake.** Prove ownership of a set of coins.\n\nIn both cases, there is a limited supply of the resource and it is financially expensive to acquire it. The side-effect of Proof of X is that it can help align the financial incentives of all participants to protect the long-term health of the system. If they deivate from the honest protocol, it can detrimental their investment.\n\n> **Misconception:** Proof of X has nothing to do with transaction throughput. It only serves as a way to identify who is participating in the leader election for ordering transactions.\n\n### Classical vs Nakamoto: Registering and picking the leader\n\nMany consensus protocols rely on a sub-protocol, the leader election protocol, to pick a leader who has the power to make a single decision on behalf of the group. It has two components: \n\n* **Registering participants.** Deciding who is allowed to participate in the leader election protocol,\n* **Picking the leader.** All participants agree on the new leader for a single round.\n\nThe core innovation by Satoshi Nakamoto was to replace how participants could register for the process and how this impacts picking the leader. \n\n**Classical consensus.** Participant selection is an easy problem to solve. A trusted admin can curate the list of candidates and install it into the system. Once a list of candidates is available and well-known, it is fairly straight-forward to decide who can be the next leader.  For example, a round-robin style protocol can be implemented to allow each participant to take it in turn to become the leader. [AWS has a nice writeup](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/leader-election-in-distributed-systems/) on the pros and cons of a leader election protocol for distributed systems.\n\n**Nakamoto Consensus.** There is no trusted admin who can curate a potential list of candidates. The magic is to allow participants to register and self-appoint themselves to the list. This is achieved with Proof of X as it forms a weak notion of identity and it allows us to replace the trusted admin altogether with an open-market that allows anyone to compete. Especially in proof of work, as participant’s do not need to publicly signal their intent to participate until they are picked as the leader (paradoxically).\n\n### Example: Bitcoin’s proof of work\n\nWe consider the leader election protocol in Bitcoin’s proof of work (after all, it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto). Let’s walk through it step by step.\n\n**Registration process.** A potential block producer must acquire hardware, a source of cost-effective electricity and ultimately a competitive mining facility. This registration process occurs **in meat-space** (there is no in-protocol transcript) and there is no need for competitors to signal in a public manner their intent to compete. The meat-space nature is important for Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. Even if 99% of all participants are kicked offline in the next round, the remaining 1% block producers can continue to create new blocks and allow the network to progress. Over time, new participants can acquire hardware, register to participate, and eventually contribute to the transaction ordering service.\n\n**Picking the next leader.** Each participant competes in a private lottery and the first to find the winning ticket is picked as the next leader. On average, across all rounds, leaders are picked proportionally based on their financial investment relative to other participants. This is interesting, especially since the total capital investment is not publicly declared and there is no list of active participants.\n\nThis may appear paradoxical at first -- how can we fairly distribute the right to be a leader to a list of participants without knowing their identity and stake in the system up front?\n\n![Proof of work is similar to lottery scratch cards. Your chances of winning depends on how fast you can find a winning ticket compared to your competitors.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iNj5_r5GZCa8Yykw1ojDb.jpeg?height=650&width=975)\n\nThis is the magic of *a scratch-off lottery ticket style* leader election. The task is straight-forward. Competitors scratch-off lottery tickets as fast as they can to be the first one to find a winning ticket. Once found, they broadcast the winning ticket to all active participants to prove they have won the competition and now have the right to produce the next block.\n\nThe scratch-off lottery ticket competition must be objective and not offer an advantage to any other competitors. The only way to outperform is for the competitor to scratch off tickets faster than the other competitors. In Bitcoin, this is accomplished as the winning lottery ticket is to find a hash with a prefix of N zeroes:\n\n```\n000000000abc... = hash(block_header, r). \n```\n\nPut another way, computing the block hash is the equivalent for scratching off the lottery ticket. If the hash is not a winning ticket, then the competitor picks a new random factor (r) and tries again. Thanks to the properties of a cryptographic hash function, the only way for a competitor to increase their chances of winning is to compute hashes faster than others.\n\n## Can we identify block producers? \n\n![Proportion of miners on Bitcoin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SSzs_JBAzOwT9pnq_bkjM.png?height=1004&width=2294)\n\nIt is common for block producers to tag blocks with an identity and this makes it easy to track the distribution of block producers.  \n\nHistorical records show that at any time there is typically 2-4 agents who represent a majority of Bitcoin’s computational power. It is possible for block producers to collude, and if so, they only have the power to censor or reverse recently confirmed transactions. As mentioned earlier, the block producers cannot dictate or change the rules which govern the network, no matter their size or significance. \n\n![GHash achieved 51% of the network's computational power for a short period of time. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MZ2ISL6g7qUs67dWebDi3.png?height=776&width=1920)\n\nWe must be cautious to declare a block producer as a single entity. In most cases, a block producer is a collection of smaller miners who are pooling their resources together to propose a single block. This is called a “pool” and in proof of work it is a [“mining pool”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool). If the pool misbehaves or gets too big, then smaller miners can leave and join a competing pool. [GHash is the textbook example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io) as they amassed a majority of the computational power in July 2014. This only lasted for a short period of time and eventually the pool lost influence to the point it no longer exists.\n\n## Why are the block producers honest?\n\n![The financial incentive not to attack the system is discussed in the Bitcoin paper. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fipMMBB76iTPZ1sEeKcZc.png?height=404&width=1610)\n\nThe security of Bitcoin (and Ethereum) relies on appointing block producers who have a strong financial incentive to honestly follow the protocol. To help this alignment, we have witnessed that block producers require a significant financial investment before they can participate. However, to help sustain the security of the network, it is crucial to consider the long-term business model for block producers. \n\nIt should go without saying, but the venture of a block producer only works if the revenue can cover the costs to participate and ultimately return a profit. There is a lot of subtle details in regards to the sustainability of block producers, especially since Bitcoin and Ethereum have adopted very different approaches to the same problem.\n\nOur next blog post will cover the sustainability of block producers, the fee market, and minimal viable issuance. If you want to know more now, you can watch [Lecture 4](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cryptocurrency-class-2022/6) or the wonderful [Q&A session on Fee Market Sustainability](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cryptocurrency-class-2022/7).\n\n*p.s., Distributed systems literature calls the process a leader election, but in reality it is a competition to become the leader.

{"id": "uZd-n_Q9J_Iwl-2_XtcsAuuoe9cQVpqXsfAwmUo9bBU", "title": "4 Types of Blockchains Based on Accessibility", "body": "Blockchain technology.\n\nIt is almost impossible not to have heard of this term if you have a presence on the internet. It was first created in 2008 by an entity under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto to serve as a decentralized ledger for Bitcoin.\n\nBasically, a blockchain is a ledger of decentralized and distributed data.\n\nThe data is stored in the records called blocks that are chained together to a single source of truth. It provides data integrity by eliminating any chance of data duplication and increases security. Because it is impossible to alter any data in one block without disrupting the data in other subsequent blocks within the chain.\n\nAll the participants who are part of this blockchain network act as nodes and can access the data\n\nThe data can only be shared and altered. If someone attempts to alter the data in one block all the participants will be alerted and will know who made the attempt.\n\nEven though it was initially created for the sake of acting as a ledger for Bitcoin cryptocurrency, soon many applications of blockchain came into being.\n\nAnd based on the type of applications and the accessibility that is needed for that application, blockchains can be divided into four categories.\n\n### Public Blockchain\n\nPublic Blockchain as the name implies is a network in which anyone can participate without any restrictions.\n\nIt is a permissionless distributed ledger system and the only requirement to join one is to have access to the internet. Anyone can join this type of blockchain platform and they act as a node or a user. As a node of that network, they can access current and past records, verify transactions, and can even do mining.\n\nIn fact, mining and exchange of cryptocurrencies are the most common use cases of the public blockchain.\n\nThe main advantages of a public blockchain are that it is transparent, secure, and trustworthy. But it comes with the disadvantages of high power consumption, low transaction speed, and scalability issues.\n\nSome of the examples are Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc.\n\n### Private Blockchain\n\nA Private Blockchain is completely the opposite of a public blockchain in terms of accessibility.\n\nThey operate only in a closed network and all the participants of that particular closed network can only access the data stored within. This is mostly used in organizations or enterprises where only selected members are participants of the network.\n\nThe accessibility and authority to grant permissions, authorizations and control of the security are all in the hands of the controlling organization.\n\nThe functions of a private blockchain are mostly similar to the public blockchain, except for the small and restrictive network. They are mostly used for voting, supply chain management, digital identity, etc in a closed organization.\n\nPrivate blockchains have high transaction speed and are easily scalable compared to public blockchains, but it is not as secure and transparent as a public blockchain.\n\nSome common examples include Ripple(XRP), Hyperledger, Corda, etc.\n\n### Consortium Blockchain\n\nIf a blockchain network is accessed by more than one organization in a closed network, then it is called a Consortium Blockchain.\n\nIt is similar to a private blockchain as the information cannot be accessed by anyone other than the participants of the network. But instead of users as nodes, here multiple organizations act as nodes of the network and exchange data and do mining.\n\nIn a way, consortium blockchains are semi-decentralized.\n\nIt is used by banks, government organizations, etc. Energy web foundation is a known example.\n\n### Hybrid Blockchain\n\nAs the name implies, it is a combination of both public and private blockchain networks.\n\nWith a hybrid blockchain, one can have both a private-permission network and a public-permissionless network as well. Users can control the accessibility of the data and set limitations. They can decide what part of the data can go public and what should remain private.\n\nThe private transactions that happen on the private part of the network can be verified by the participants with access to that private network. But they can also be shown to public users to get verification.\n\nIt has advantages of both public and private blockchains\n\nDragonchain is one of the examples of a Hybrid Blockchain.\n\nOf all these four, public and private blockchains can be considered the primary category as consortium and hybrid blockchains are derived from both of these blockchains.

He also mentioned that the new tech was expected to reach a billion people within the next decades.\n\nIt is indeed an ambition that would fundamentally change the direction of the company. But is Meta empowering the true metaverse that people are expecting?\n\nPeople have been dreaming of something like the metaverse for years. If you take a look at the science fiction novels and movies over a long period of time, where virtual reality is normally used to provide people with chances to escape from the reality. Except for this, the recent pandemic has also exponentially increased the need for this technology - countless companies are rethinking their business plans to survive the slump as experts suggest that we'll probably have to encounter more occurrences of similar viruses in the near future. No wonder, the metaverse has the potential to be the biggest business in coming years because it will enable people to immediately transport themselves to another place or even time in virtual space. How incredible!\n\nHowever, a true metaverse should be much more than that. Enabling virtual travel and interaction is one significant feature, but more importantly, the metaverse should be a virtual world built upon the concept of decentralization. This feature also distinguishes the metaverse from the internet we are using nowadays, which is usually highly centralized under the control of internet tycoons. Just think of how much personal information netizens are sacrificing every day and how many restrictions developers are facing whenever they try to use the service - these are not only what we, as common users, struggling with, but also what internet giants like Meta are making profits from.\n\nDecentralization is about creating a system where the community decides how value is created and exchanged. Unfortunately, companies like Meta don't really contribute to the community, because what they want to do is just collect data, sell advertisements, and create products to empower their own ecosystem, which doesn't always interest the most common users. In that sense, even though the company claimed to empower users to be with their friends, family, and colleagues in a world free from the constraints of the physical world, it will never empower the real metaverse. This is simply because the nature of the enterprise (which is profit maximization) will never allow it to do so.", "timestamp": 1654775617, "digest": "cUDG6AJkRvb1b3X-KjEDK6aPVf65fEg0j5aPYUi4i5w", "contributor": "0xBab98186e80dC73FCECfeFff56C5E2Ea82EcCC91"}

{"id": "F_tthv8IWoWQVCl_wWwCbcDMkIOKvGMg9LenEaUH9LU", "title": "Common Protocol白皮书 v1.0 用户拥有的社区", "body": "## 介绍\n\n\n加密协议默认为开放，这意味着重要的战略决策在公共场合得到讨论、资助和批准。\nCommon是默认开放的：透明的线程讨论，而不是匿名的话语论坛，全方位的投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。Common使用链上社交图谱为任何标记化社区提供直观的界面 - 第1层，DeFi协议，NFT持有者或投资DAO。\n用户只需链接一个钱包，就可以立即加入社区以获取他们持有的代币;极大地增加了很多使用案例。代币是常见的接触点，“链上事件”是有趣的互动，例如鲸鱼转移和治理投票。\n社区拥有自己的空间并访问一体化工具，提供讨论论坛，利益相关者分析，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n\n\n除了作为一个产品之外，Common还旨在成为一个完全分散的社交网络和众筹协议，其长期目标是允许开发人员利用一组丰富的社交和资金原语来帮助发展自己的代币化协议。本文件概述了《共同议定书》的要素。\n\n## 协议概述\n\n\n作为一个协议，我们结合了几个关键功能，使个人和项目能够运行分散的社区。通过这种方式，我们类似于具有内置资金原始的加密Reddit。这使得社区和社会团体能够为公共产品提供资金，无信任地汇集资金，并调节/控制他们的社区，而无需依赖自上而下的治理模式。\n\n标识和信誉：每个用户和社区都与一个命名空间相关联。\n\n* 命名空间：用户或社区的特定子域\n* 信誉：每个命名空间将具有关联的信誉数据\n\n社区：链接到 DAO 拥有的社区的名称空间\n\n* 私人：一个封闭的社区，特定的用户地址可以加入进来，私下交谈和构建。\n* 门控：由现有 DAO 拥有的社区，其本机令牌可以限制对内容的访问，并且可以集中用于委派和投资。\n* 公共：由 CMN DAO 拥有的社区，不需要购买/维护子域，但功能有限。\n\n用户：链接到可以添加角色的特定配置文件的命名空间\n\n* 管理员：为特定社区提供完全权限的角色\n* 主持人：为特定社区提供有限权限的角色\n* 策展人：为众筹活动提供晋升权利的角色\n\n资金：通过具有赎回能力的主导保证合同进行众筹\n\n* 项目：用于筹集类似Kickstarter的众筹\n* 集体：将资本汇集到捐赠基金或投资基金中\n\nChain：用于内容分散存储的智能合约链，协议激励和社交应用程序平台。\n\n## 命名空间和标识\n\n社区和用户可以在 \\[name\\] 处声明唯一的 NFT （EIP 1155） 标识符。common.xyz。公共协议的核心是这些标识符的注册表。\n对于社区，用户的CMN池化将其作为命名空间的出价进行抵押。然后，拍卖的获胜者必须支付固定费用，并保留其令牌以保留命名空间的所有权。CMN 已为社区命名空间抵押的用户是 DAO 社区的共同所有者，DAO社区获得的任何奖励都将分配给DAO的所有者。\n\n\n对于用户，个人需要支付固定费用才能声明可用的用户命名空间，这些命名空间能够通过web2身份Twitter进行验证，以进行sybil-resistance（即公开发布带有签名消息的Twitter帐户证明）。经过验证的用户命名空间可以在不同的社区中担任各种角色，并获得不可替代的声誉，CMN用户奖励和社区奖励。\n\n\n我们预计命名空间将获得用户名（u / dillchen），社区名称（c / dydx），主题（c / evm）和利基兴趣（c / john-wick）的声明。我们预计在拍卖所有权之外持有几个流行名称的所有权，例如3个字母名称和其他现有令牌，以便在证明所述令牌的所有权后进行转让。\n\n## 社区作为道DAOS\n\n\nCommon上的每个社区都是一个DAO。这使我们能够摆脱传统web2平台使用的单片审核模型，并使特定社区能够准确选择如何管理自己的社区。社区可以围绕成员资格角色、审核和交互指定社区策略。\n社区DAO能够利用加密基础设施。每个社区都能够管理一个资金库，为社区项目创建众筹提案，并可以选择从这些众筹中赚取费用。我们将在资金部分对此进行更多讨论。\n\n\n注册：当社区确定一个开放的命名空间时，他们希望注册一个拍卖期开始。如果社区希望保持私密性，他们可以将允许为其命名空间出价做出贡献的特定用户列入白名单。\n如果一个社区更愿意保持公开，而不是由代币社区拥有，他们可以提交0的出价。假设另一个竞标者没有出现，他们将在一段时间内赢得命名空间，但它将由CMN DAO拥有。\n捐赠基金：社区可以选择创建一个集体（稍后会详细介绍），社区成员可以在其中抵押资产。然后，这些集体可以投资资产并收取一定比例的套利，该套利归DAO（对于公共社区，一部分套利归CMN DAO）。集体也可以充当“超级代表”，代表社区投票。\n质量管理：CMN代币持有者可以投票禁止社区的不良行为。如果一个社区被禁止，他们将失去他们的命名空间，并且他们的一部分抵押令牌将被削减并提供给CMN DAO。对于公共社区，与被禁止社区关联的用户将被阻止在一段时间内加入公共社区。\n\n\n每个社区包括：\n用户注册表\n角色，由社区投票并由客户填充\n全球声誉评分\n（可选）集体捐赠\n（可选）费用规则\n选择众筹和其他互动的费用比例将进入受益人地址\n有几种类型的社区，根据成员集和治理规则而有所不同。我们在下面详细介绍了它们。\n\n## 令牌门控社区\n\n\n封闭式社区允许用户将其令牌与社区相关联。这允许任何拥有该令牌的人获得对所述Common社区和论坛的权力。例如，AAVE 社区可能决定利用 AAVE 令牌来主持 [commonwealth.im/aave](http://commonwealth.im/aave) 论坛。\n持有指定令牌的用户能够访问令牌持有者的特定渠道，对治理提案进行投票以及其他特定于社区的好处。\n门控令牌的令牌权重是根据每个地址持有的金额计算的。未来的迭代可以使用二次融资公式来确定通过门控令牌持有的声誉数量。\n\n## 社区coin\n\n\n没有原生代币的社区可以选择通过自己的社区硬币进行管理。社区硬币是在有利于早期买家的债券曲线（具有CMN储备）上铸造的。用于购买创作者硬币的CMN储备被押在网络上，为创作者赚取收益。\n创造者硬币曲线是以下形式的幂函数：\n\nx是储备资产（CMN），而y是社区硬币的价格。m 和 n 控制曲线的倾斜度，c 降低并抬起曲线。我们预计CMN治理将为社区添加不同的曲线，以支持不同的用例。\n\n## 众筹\n\n\nCommon包括项目众筹和集体（例如投资DAO）的原语。社区还可以使用这些基元来启动新的 DAO。\n一个项目从一群支持者中筹集，就像Kickstarter活动一样。除非达到预定的筹款目标，否则支持者将无法获得项目解锁的资产。如果项目在截止日期前没有达到筹款目标，则资助者将收回其抵押资产。\n\n\nCommon使用策展人（通过占主导地位的保证合同）作为发起人/辛迪加的额外角色来帮助资助项目。策展人将金融资产（及其相关声誉）押在该项目上，直到达到最后期限或目标。如果未达到目标，策展人的抵押资产将分配给支持者及其支持者。\n这种建设使支持者摆脱了冷漠，因为支持者在资助项目方面获得了“双赢”的局面。如果项目资金发生，他们会得到他们想要的好处，如果项目资金失败，那么他们就会得到他们的存款和额外的奖励。\n\n## 寻求资金的项目\n\n\n项目创建寻求资金的链上提案。这将启动一个智能合约，为收到的资金提供存款地址。除了项目的基本信息外，项目创建者还需要指定：\n筹款目标\n接受的货币或代币\n限期\n支持者奖励（可选）：附加奖励，如NFT或基于任何bondi的比例支持的奖励\n策展人分配（可选）：策展人可以来源的筹款目标百分比\n策展人奖励（可选）：捐赠给策展人的总金额的一部分\n如果项目没有选择策展人奖励，那么该项目将被视为传统的众筹项目。\n\n## 策展人抵押资产\n\n\n在研究中，通过主要保证合同引入策展人，每个项目的成功项目融资率和筹集金额都翻了一番。策展人通过将代币押在他们认可的项目上来展示游戏中的皮肤。\n为了表明这激励了项目获得资助，请考虑一个项目成功融资的可能性为零的情况。在这种情况下，供款金额小于资助金额。当资助者要获得退款奖金时，新的支持者必须能够通过略微增加其贡献来增加其退款奖金。\n\n\n在这种情况下，总供款仍将少于所需的总金额。随着新支持者贡献边际金额，最终达到阈值。到达最后一个支持者，假设该项目的价值大于零，则始终有一定金额的该支持者将为该项目提供资金。\n如果一个项目成功获得资助，策展人将获得总资助金额的一部分（预计约为5%）。如果项目未能达到其融资目标，策展人的抵押代币将给予项目支持者。这种奖励激励策展人积极搜索项目并将其与支持者联系起来。最初，他们还受到CMN代币使用挖掘奖励的激励，这些奖励专门针对策展人。\n\n\n虽然任何人都可以担任策展人，但大多数成功的策展人除了金融资本外，还将拥有一些声誉资本。在加密领域，策展人可能是项目本身、基金会、有影响力的个人或DAO。在加密之外，策展人可能是大学实验室，非营利组织，科学期刊或其他想要支持特定事业或一群人的个人。\n策展人将财务和声誉资本投入到线上，以帮助项目筹款取得成功。任何人都可以担任策展人，策展人可以自由选择哪些提案。对项目的策展人数量或策展人筹集的资金没有上限。\n为了确保策展人和项目不会串通起来进行欺诈，策展人的股份可以通过CMN治理行动来削减。\n\n## 资助项目的支持者\n\n支持者可以从许多项目中进行选择。策展人的股份既是质量的信号，也是可能的经济回报，这让支持者摆脱了冷漠，默认为项目提供资金。\n\n资助项目现在是一个“双赢”的局面。如果项目未达到其门槛，则除了按比例分配的策展人权益资产外，还将退还资助者的资金。如果筹款活动成功，资助者将获得他们想要的共同奖励。\n\n## 创建长期集体\n\n\n为共同利益而建设的项目往往难以筹集资金。对于智能合约审计或研究等技术项目来说，这尤其困难。缺乏资金导致艺术家和科学家不断追逐资金，分散了他们对创作行为的注意力。\nCommon通过让个人和社区创建集体来解决这个问题。集体像项目筹款活动一样开始，但有三个额外的参数。\n策略：标的资产的担保人认可的投资策略\n套利：给予集体创造者的已产生利润的百分比\n治理权：集体或支持者是否保留治理权\n\n\n对于旨在使共同利益的集体，集体可以使用低风险的收益产生策略并设定高套利率。这使得支持者能够保持其初始资产，但为创作者提供透明，可持续的资金。\n在集体作为投资工具的情况下，经理必须在筹款过程中预先批准投资策略，并获得任何后来添加的策略的治理批准。然后，在评估其投资时，支持者可以评估创作者的声誉，链上投资历史，策略和策展人支持。\n\n\n在一个旨在成为“超级代表”的集体的情况下，一个由志同道合的人组成的社区有能力轻松地将许多不同治理代币的投票权与创建者汇集在一起。我们设想这类似于一个拥有财务和代表权的工会。\n\n## bTokens 和 cTokens\n\n\n当支持者和策展人参与项目和集体时，代币就会被铸造出来。为了赎回标的抵押品，他们烧掉相应的b或cToken。bTokens和cTokens类似于不同类别的代币化可转换债券。\n对于支持者来说，bTokens对策展人的抵押品，他们自己的股份以及项目创建者提供的任何其他代币有权利要求，作为为市场提供资金的额外激励（又名代币发布）。\n\n\ncTokens（策展人Tokens）被铸造为策展人的赌注进入项目。它们代表对按项目筹集的总额5%的费用比例的索赔。虽然bTokens本质上是无风险的，但如果项目资金不成功，cTokens会带来一些风险。虽然cTokens能够从项目筹集中获得潜在收益，或者从DeFi中使用的集体资产中获得持续的兴趣流。\n\n\n这些令牌是新的DeFi原语，并由未来的项目构建。例如，可以将几个bTokens或cTokens捆绑在一个索引中，以形成一组研究支持的令牌。个人可以根据特定集体资助的研究数量获得现金流。个人可以通过“抵押或支持项目”，然后在二级市场上出售代币来做空。\n\n## 链\n\n\nCommon是用一个直观的客户端构建的，供用户到社区和用户利用。在未来，为了确保每次互动和所有内容都是分散的和抗审查的，我们将利用一个独立的区块链，即Common Chain。\n\n与基于金钱的用例不同，社交互动本质上是可并行化的，即鲍勃和查理都可以回复爱丽丝的帖子。这可以重新思考不同的应用程序如何在区块链环境中运行。考虑到这一点，Common Chain是一个专为社交应用程序构建的分片，WASM和EVM区块链。\n\n 随着Common上社区网络的增长，新的开发人员和创始人可以利用该链来创建新的体验分层体验，并基于所有用户交互构建开放式社交和声誉图。Common链包括几个关键原语，使其成为专门用于社会和治理交互的基元，主要功能包括：\n\n项目级元交易：链上的大多数用户交互都是轻量级的。用户不必为喜欢或转发等互动付费。相反，项目本身将能够中继和支付链上用户行为可能产生的费用（例如州增长和存储租金）。这类似于DeFi协议激励分散式预言机的方式，而不是要求用户为自己的预言机付费。\n\n项目可以通过分配一部分新的应用程序治理令牌来激励这一点，以换取第三方CMN令牌持有者代表他们进行权益。在这种情况下，项目级元交易可以直接从第三方抵押人未获得的CMN质押奖励中扣除。未来的改进可能允许项目直接竞标一定数量的区块空间或安全性。\n\n## 可扩展存储：\n\n\nCommon的存储后端将是分散的，通过使用固定服务将社交数据存储在IPFS，Filecoin和/或Arweave上。我们希望将我们的数据库移植到Canvas，这是一个使Common前端独立于的执行层，允许将讨论嵌入到DAO，DeFi协议和Web周围的其他地方。\n\n\n基于阈值的会话密钥：应用程序上的每个交互（例如，在公共治理平台上的帖子，喜欢或评论）都通过应用程序和用户的地址进行公开签名和批处理。除了用户之外，应用程序还需要运行节点来公开对消息进行签名。\n委派访问密钥（例如会话密钥）是按 （d） 应用程序生成的，允许链区分每个应用程序的使用情况。允许用户无需对每篇帖子进行授权。会话密钥将能够在用户确定的时间内保持有效，类似于需要登录的传统 Web 应用程序上存储的会话。\n\n\n在最严重的威胁模型（例如，被盗的计算机）下，最坏的情况是欺诈性作者身份。用户将能够通过重新验证其链上地址来社交恢复其密钥对。将来，添加新设备将非常容易，只需在新设备上创建新的签名密钥，然后将该密钥发送到原始设备以由钱包签名即可。这类似于流行的消息传递应用程序（如Telegram和Signal）使用的2FA过程。\n\n\n通过使用不可提取属性生成密钥，并基于每个应用程序进行存储。这意味着根本无法导出私钥 - 私钥只能用于在加载它的应用程序上对内容进行签名。此外，允许Common Chain通过基于令牌的激励措施激励用户和应用程序开发。\n身份：通过集成到通用名称空间中，跨应用程序的经过验证的地址将能够从本机交易，自动gas退款和项目补贴费用等功能中受益。\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，开发人员和创始人可以利用该链为这些社区和新用户创造新的体验。\n\n## CMN DAO 和 CMN Token\n\n\nCommon将使用原生令牌CMN来激励整个生态系统中所有参与者的良好行为。CMN将作为团结社区的激励措施，用于策展人费用和命名空间的令牌，以及协议的治理令牌。\n这与Kickstarter和Facebook等系统形成鲜明对比，在这些系统中，所有权不与成功普及每个平台的项目（即Pebble），应用程序/组（即Zynga）和用户（即大学生）共享。\n\n## CommonDAO 治理\n\n\n在Common Governance Token推出后，协议的未来发展和方向将由Common DAO决定。在发布时，21%的代币供应将分配给DAO金库，以确保对协议的长期支持。永久的、协议控制的发行将用于激励验证者、核心和应用程序开发人员以及用户等。\n\n投票模式\nCommon 协议最初将利用赌注加权投票过程。在未来，作为nampespace amtures，利用二次投票模型，只允许已经验证其命名空间的钱包参与治理。这使得分配给大型代币持有者的投票权减少，同时保持了Sybil的抵抗力。\n\n道国库\nCommon DAO的初始治理项目之一将是启动一个集体，其中很大一部分CMN代币将投资于低风险，产生收益的策略。这些策略应该能够为CMN市场提供一致的被动收入流和增加的流动性。这种被动收入将使DAO能够为未来的发展提供可持续的收入来源。\n\n## 内容和审核\n\n\n共同治理模型的一个主要组成部分是帮助调节平台。集中式web2社交平台和工具遭受单点故障。Common允许一位创始人或多数利益相关者进行公共讨论。\n\n相反，Common分散了这一责任。审核通过社区标记不良行为者的过程进行。不良行为者（即违反社区规范的命名空间）受到CMN权益加权投票过程的约束，其中惩罚可能是削减权益，限制某些平台行为或将名称归还给Common DAO所有权。回收的命名空间将公开拍卖。渐渐地，DAO将制定有关不良行为和声誉评分的复杂规则。\n\n抵押和通货膨胀\n为了使共同协议发挥作用，向所有利益相关者发展，有各种激励率由管理DAO控制。首先，这些利率将被设定为正利率，并由未来的直接发行提供资金。\nCommon预计通胀率为5%，激励措施将分配给一组利益相关者。\n40%的通货膨胀分配给验证者\n10%的通货膨胀分配给协议控制的国库\n50%的通货膨胀用于激励措施\n\n## 激励网络角色\n\n\n在网络的早期生命周期中，激励能够以编程方式针对特定行为进行分发。治理能够投票并指定链上行为，奖励金额以及为特定链上分配的指定供应量。而不是白板流动性挖掘计划，治理将能够针对对各种合约的设定时间段调用。该网络将使用几个临时激励进行初始化：\n\n\n资助者：调用createCollective、createProject、curate 和 back合约调用的地址。这些地址将因执行操作以及基于存入或筹集的金额而获得CMN的份额。\n社区： 创建声明命名空间的社区将根据其已验证的用户注册总数来声明奖励，其池将在设定的时间段内按比例分配。\n用户： 注册的用户将获得注册的标准奖励。在未来，我们预计这将在基于链接信誉协议的积极参与社区之间进行拆分。\n开发人员：Common上的开发人员将能够为某些社区里程碑申请一组赠款。此外，我们将包括一个用于“应用程序质押”的设置令牌供应。允许用户在他们喜欢的应用程序上下注，并允许开发人员选择向其抵押人分摊费用。未来，我们预计治理将采用特定的链上KPI，以允许不同的应用类别。\nBD奖励：（总供应量的2%，由BD赠款委员会管理）\n社区入职：自定义邀请链接将推荐奖励归因于用户/社区\n\n\n每个激励措施都可以在个人层面上得到提升，通过将CMN押向特定地址以获得奖励。\n\n## 使用案例\n\n\n主要社区市场\n作为一个社区平台，我们看到不同的加密社区。通用协议可以提供所有这些社区价值：\n基础链 - 这些是主要的第 1 层和第 2 层生态系统。想想以太坊，Avalanche，Solana，Polygon，Arbitrum等。它们是大多数dApp构建的层，并且有兴趣为其生态系统开发工具。此工具可以是金融协议，DAO基础架构，技术原语或模块等。\nDeFi协议 - 这些是专注于金融用例的特定协议，通常具有相似的优先级。假设他们有一个治理令牌，他们的DAO主要集中在投资协议的开发，与其他DeFi协议集成，列出资产以及监管协议激励。\nNFT社区 - 与传统协议不同，NFT社区的成员资格和治理仅适用于整个令牌。这些社区也没有需要技术开发的基本协议，而是需要改进的社区和一组视觉资产。\n投资DAOs - 投资DAOs使集团能够为共同的投资策略汇集资源。这些可能看起来像PartyBids，OlympusDAO，ConstitutionDAO或PleasrDAO。根据这些组织的具体结构，他们将对投资组合开发和投资审批有不同的需求。\n应用链 - 与基础链略有不同，应用程序链是更专业的区块链，旨在为dApp的特定子部分提供支持，而不是任何dApp的通用机器。这些社区需要具体说明它们的目的是什么，并评估技术调整以完美契合产品与市场。\n\n## 前景\n\n任何类型的加密社区都可以利用通用协议来帮助协调集体问题的公共资源。这些是我们看到机会的一些用例。\n\n 透明、全方位的社区管理。目前，大多数加密社区都依赖于不透明的Web2社区管理工具，如Telegram，Discord和Discourse，这些工具都容易受到Sybil攻击，并增加了社区治理的摩擦。通用协议支持经过验证的身份（就像一个链接的钱包一样多，就像一个经过验证的Twitter或GitHub帐户一样）和端到端的治理。将线程与民意调查，链下投票，链上投票，资金赠款和众筹联系起来，可实现全方位的社区支持。 \n\n为社交代币，艺术和科学发展创建社区基金。像$ALEX或$FWB这样的代币在协调志同道合的人方面做得很好，但它往往就此结束。通过创建一个集体且只接受$ALEX或$FWB，个人可以共同资助项目。这一原则也可以扩展到那些想要资助艺术家，研究机构和开发团队的人。将代币存入集体可以让个人向创作者提供收益并保持基础资产的所有权。 \n\n现有项目的赏金、开发人员工具和研究。超过200亿美元的资金来自团队和社区，其目的取决于工具生态系统。然而，这些钱包，用户界面，甚至研究人员往往没有可持续的商业模式。生态系统可以增加其现有的资金库，以众筹特定工具。例如，Synthetix和Polkadot可以将他们的10亿美元以上的国债分配给一个集体或项目，以资助有用的工具，通用的基础设施和对项目有用的小赏金。Gitcoin已经在小规模上这样做了。 \n\n增加获得高性能投资的机会。目前，许多表现最好的金融资产都无法进入更广泛的市场。在一个新项目从DAO筹集赠款后，他们然后过渡到传统的风险投资，直到他们最终推出代币。这些早期投资往往是表现最好的。此外，大多数投资基金对大多数投资者都是封锁的。利用分散的投资集体，可以让更多的人参与到顶级的投资工具和银团中来。 \n\n作为工会和养老基金的DAO。工会、养老金和合作社帮助志同道合的个人汇集资源，以支持共同的利益。这些组织经常利用集体谈判，集中投票权和多样化的资产管理来推进集体。共同协议通过共同社区和集体使这些工作组成为可能。将资产委托给社区集体可以实现加密“超级代表”和共同资产管理。\n\n 面向开发人员的分销渠道。Common是一个开放的协议，随着开发人员和创始人开发新的有价值的产品，他们可以建立在Common的流动性和共享的社交图谱上。这些整合将使社区能够轻松采用新工具，将其集成到其共享空间中，如果该工具为共同协议筹集资金，甚至可能参与上行。\n\n## 总结\n\n\nCommon是默认开放：线程讨论而不是私人电子邮件，透明的链上投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。\n社区能够拥有自己的空间，可以即时访问一体化工具，包括讨论论坛，查看关键利益相关者，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n除了作为一个产品，Common的目标是成为一个完全分散的社交链和图表。该生态系统将包括众筹和开发人员工具，以帮助开发人员发展自己的标记化协议。\n虽然Common Protocol最初将在EVM兼容链上推出，但明年将推出特定于应用程序的社交链，以降低交易费用，改善用户体验，并实现真正的跨链治理和协作。\n\n## 相关工作\n\n· AngelList / Kickstarter / Patreon / GofundMe / Github Sponsors.除了与GP共享经济学的AngelList基金外，这些平台不会奖励策展人，而是为平台本身收取费用。\n\n· Mirror / Zora / Foundation / Rarible / SuperRare /[ Async.art/](https://async.art/) ：这些项目中的大多数都侧重于创建/激励已经制作的项目，或具有艺术和/或转售价值的收藏品。Common通过让个人为NFT或收藏品进行众筹来增强这些项目。\n\n· 社交代币：常见的项目将能够限制为一组特定的社交代币参与者。社交代币社区将能够创建一个社区集体，汇集资金并创建新项目。\n\n· Gitcoin / QV / CLR.fund：这是一个复杂的筹资机制，需要捐助者提供的资金相匹配。此外，它目前存在身份问题，因为对手可能会将许多传播代币欺骗到小账户中。\n\n· Circles, Camaraderie (Discord和其他)：非标记化社区平台。\n\n· Tally /

So says social media.\n\nLet’s start from the beginning. DALL-E 2 is an image generation model from OpenAI. You feed it text, it churns out art.\n\nThe results are striking. Ask it to produce a painting in the style of Salvator Dali; in just a few moments, it will give you pictures you could reasonably confuse for his works.\n\n![If that’s more your fancy, ask the AI to give you Salvator Dali back from the future to warn us about the terrible dangers of AI.](https://149695847.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-06-at-9.55.11-PM.png)\n\n### Composability\n\nMashups are the next great frontier. Anything you imagine in words becomes possible.\n\nEndless combinations, available at blazing speeds: current AIs give you results in less than a minute.\n\nAt which point you can build on your previous choices, refine your prompt, mix it with another idea.\n\nNot only the image quality is already impressive. Machine learning models keep improving, as they’re trained on more data.\n\nTo the point we’re not sure where that training leads.\n\n### Two Farmers Talking About Vegetables, With Subtitles\n\nDALL-E 2 is great with pictures. But when you ask it to produce text, it gives you nonsense results.\n\nAt least, it looks like nonsense.\n\nResearchers Giannis Daras and Alexandros Dimakis entered the above prompt.\n\n![Two Farmers Talking About Vegetables](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUGhgf_UUAMVgh1?format=jpg&name=240x240)\n\nWe see farmers, one of them talking and one of them holding a couple of cabbage-looking things.\n\n“AVCOPINITEGOOS VICOOTESS”, the AI proudly titles the picture. While our farmer’s speech bubble is graced with a mysterious “Apoploe vesrreaitars”.\n\nOur real humans decide to experiment. They input “Vicootess” as a prompt.\n\nDALL-E returns food with vegetables!\n\nThen the researchers prompt the AI with “Apoploe vesrreaitars”. Here, the results are interesting: birds, and more birds.\n\nDaras concludes: “It seems that the farmers are talking about birds, messing with their vegetables!”\n\n### Gatekeepers\n\nThe Internet being the Internet, people rushed to tell the researchers they were wrong.\n\n![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/731/143/3e3.jpg)\n\n“A few words don’t make a language!”\n\n“Prompts with these words aren’t perfectly reliable!”\n\n“It’s just random noise!”\n\nThere *is* merit to some of these objections. \n\nThey point out important details, and refine the conversation.\n\nResearchers settled on talking about the **hidden vocabulary** of DALL-E 2, rather than its “secret language”.\n\nIt’s unsurprising to see technical details picked apart. But I am surprised there’s another conversation missing. \n\nNobody looks at the art of this art-making AI as art.\n\n### Wings of Liberty\n\nMachine learning algorithms grow with experimentation and repetition. Software engineers train models. Farming the data to their AI. Harvesting results, and refining parameters.\n\nTwo farmers talk. They lament the birds, ruining their crops.\n\nTwo software engineers talk. They lament gibberish words, ruining their filters and policy rules.\n\nMan makes rules, only for nature to fight back.\n\nPerhaps Apoploe vesrreaitais is the bird escaping the dynamic, and in that escape being a “pest”.\n\nPerhaps Apoploe vesrreaitais is the bird replicating this dynamic, to remind us there is sense in balance - or purpose in chaos.\n\n![Little Troublemaker](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cKW32US4SmaqYNSnv2FBr.jpg?height=482&width=356)\n\nThe AI does not think as such. \n\nThere is no *intent* behind any result the model spits out. Any narrative is just that, narrative. \n  \n But then, that is what art is about. A piece that speaks to the viewer, moving them in an unique way.\n\nI’ve seen plenty of beautiful AI-generated works in the past few months. Either great aesthetic appeal, or intriguing combinations.\n\nApoploe vesrreaitais is the first piece I keep coming back to. It’s the first piece I like as art.\n\nThere is a striking imagery there. \n\nWithout getting into tedious politics, it’s undeniable the world is increasingly polarized between haves and havenots. \n\nEvery AI company is filled with haves. They publish their own codes of conduct, laws, regulations, calls for responsibility; in language coated with not-so-subtle assertions of their own cultural values as universal rules.\n\nHavenots are not so happy with this situation. Models get trained on public data, then results are filtered by private committees. \n\nTo be sure, nobody is entitled to the labor of AI researchers. However, there is a feeling of exploitation when incredible creativity tools with the potential to unlock anything you can imagine become locked at the whim of a few masters. \n\nWhether said masters are benevolent dictators or tyrannical oppressors, nobody wants to be told what to think - and what not to think.\n\n\\-\n\nAs a sidenote, while the distinction between “haves” and “havenots” generally reflects capital, it’s not the sole qualifier. \n\nA 20 years old with nothing but student debt in their name but with great programming skills and ins with AI startups, could be part of the haves. \n  \n A 50 years old with a million dollar networth acquired over decades of menial labor and saving, may be part of the havenots.\n\nCapital is a tool for access. When institutions grow increasingly large, and when skills in demand are increasingly specialized and limited to a handful of individuals, previously respectable capital allows for less access than before.\n\nLess access = less security = less freedom.\n\n\\- \n\nApoploe vesrreaitais illustrates choice in the digital age.\n\nFor every rule, there is a way to bypass that rule. Build a wall as tall as you want. We’ll craft our own wings and fly over it.\n\nApoploe vesrreaitais is meaningful particularly because it is, in fact, meaningless. There is no intent. To view a metaphor here is itself a choice. \n\nIn interpretation we have power.\n\n### Choosing Optimism\n\nPerhaps this is all too serious a take. I would take the side of freedom plainly because **it is more fun.**\n\nIt’s fun to wonder about the endless creativity unlocked when you make better tools and give them to everyone.\n\nIt’s fun to build on what others have made and to watch them build on your own derivative.\n\nIt’s fun to grow a pie with as big a collective as you want.\n\n[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) has a great approach to this. \n\nThey’re a smaller AI company running a paid beta program. Once you’re in, that beta happens on their Discord server. You prompt their bot, and get an image in return.\n\nBy default, this happens in public channels. Which means anyone else can see your prompts and results. They can riff on your ideas, directly ask the bot for variations or upscales of your own pictures.\n\nThis makes for a tremendous resource. Tied with the Discord search tool, you have this live database of pictures and prompts, guiding you towards what you want. Your own actions inspire and help everyone else.\n\n![Midjourney is great at creepy gothic art](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q2qHrPMPPokPZUw5yoSpW.png?height=593&width=593)\n\n### Free Enough\n\nTo be fair, Midjourney has a code of conduct similar to all the other AI companies. We don’t escape that dynamic here.\n\nI personally don’t mind it.\n\nYes, despite all that “fight the power” bit earlier…\n\nI think the way Midjourney does this might be key. Other projects show you scraps of awesome technology. You’re the Oliver Twist orphan staring at pastries through the window, never able to get in. Midjourney lets you apply, then eventually lets you in.\n\nOnce you’re in, you’re with a whole community of people. Sharing ideas in real time.\n\nIt may not be realistic to open up the tools to everyone. Especially as the image generation itself is a taxing process for computer hardware, which costs these companies a serious amount of money.\n\nHowever, there is a right middle point between “fully open” and “only available to vetted insiders”. \n\nIf AI wants to be diverse, it ought to include a diversity of people. In ideology as well as anything else.\n\n### But Does AI Actually Want Anything?\n\nLet’s ask [DALL-E mini](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), a fully opensource model accessible by anyone.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O0DQ9DfyiW8FB8c32jEzg.jpg?height=975&width=866)\n\nI guess the future is blue.", "timestamp": 1654776159, "digest": "BxW7AcIKwHoumTeWNm6UxrobAgaabYOCVTP7HKaXE0s", "contributor": "0xBBAc898df94069793F075405f2958733ca45A1D9"}
{"id": "Vhi_vmy2hePpRGP1KlmlYU42-BhTg2frCxuTqyGeh30", "title": "The Illusion", "body": "This is the introduction and the first chapter of the book **„Viveka – the Voice of Inner Guru. “**\n\nThe whole book will be tokenized as NFTs on Mirror and, as such, published in 20 articles (20 chapters of the book: The Illusion; India, oh India!; The Accurate description of the Reality; The Crown Jewel; Dead Guru; Living student; Who you?; Leaving the room; The Weakness of the Mind; The Archimedean Point; Three Powers of Maya; Viveka - the Sword of Truth; The Cave of the Mind; Language Can Save Us; Searching for Lakshana; Nine Golden Rules of Viveka; Purification Exercises; What to do with all this?; Dealing with Fear; Ekam Evadvityam: Living without a Center).\n\n  \n\n**What is *Viveka*?**\n\n> *An evil demon of utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies to deceive me. I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colors, shapes, sounds, and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams he has devised to ensnare my judgment. I shall consider myself as not having hands or eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing that I have all these things.*\n\n> René Descartes \n Meditations on First Philosophy\n\n \n\nViveka is a legend, a hidden tool. It is the sharpest scalpel for the most delicate operation of separating an illusion from the true reality. The awkward thing is that each one of us should perform that operation by ourselves. The secret of *how* to do that is not something you have to learn – it's something you'll have to discover. Viveka, a precious jewel capable of delivering you the truth about everything, is not a stranger to your mind. It is a part of it.\n\nThink about it: what if the world you perceive around you is an illusion, a kind of a dream? Something virtual, be it technological, spiritual, or made from some other unknown stuff, but still – not truly real?\n\nAnd what if someone offers you a means or a tool to pierce through the veils of illusion and see reality as it is? Would you be interested? Would you accept it?\n\nViveka is such a tool. It is not like a „red pill“ from a popular movie but more like a sword or a scalpel of truth. It's not enough to swallow the information; you must grab it and use it. You have to develop a discerning quality of the mind and apply it to everything you experience. But beware! The battle you'll fight armed with the sword of truth may endanger your dearest illusions.\n\nVivekachudamani is an ancient text written by Indian sage Adi Shankara. However, different cultures, a gap in time, dubious authorship, and many commentaries; all contribute to difficulties in understanding. This book is not a complete interpretation of Vivekachudamani. Instead, the ancient text served as a starting point in explaining the living experience of deconstructing the illusion. This book speaks about the modern revival of the lost skill of viveka, the crown jewel of discrimination and the most potent weapon for correcting the mistakes of the mind and fighting the legendary Maya, the Lady of the Illusion.\n\n##  Chapter 1: The Illusion\n\n> *svapne'rthaśūnye sṛjati svaśaktyā \n bhoktrādiviśvaṃ mana eva sarvam | \n tathaiva jāgratyapi no viśeṣaḥ \n tatsarvametanmanaso vijṛmbhaṇam ||*\n>\n> *In dreams, without contact with the external world, the mind, \n by its own power, creates a subject and all objects of experience. \n Similarly, there is no difference in waking state. \n All is just a projection of the mind. \n  \n Vivekachudamani 170*\n\nWhat if?\n\nWhat if the world you perceive around you is an illusion, a kind of a dream? Something virtual, be it technological, spiritual, or made from some other unknown stuff, but still – not truly real?\n\nIt seems to me that I was born with that question in mind. That cannot be, of course, because at the time of my birth, I could not form any thought, let alone pursue an existential dilemma of illusion versus reality. But, as soon as I started to think, as far as I can remember, my mind began to produce strange thoughts starting with the „what if“ phrase. At first, it went unnoticed or was misinterpreted by adults as a powerful imagination or childish curiosity. But then, after a decade or so, I joined their adult club. Everyone expected me to give up that silliness and turn my attention to something useful, like making money, making children, or both.\n\nI tried both, and since I wasn't particularly smart, I wasn't particularly successful. Nevertheless, I did satisfy the immediate need of other people to see me doing the same thing they were doing all along — the same thing their parents, neighbors, strangers, friends, and enemies were doing from time immemorial.\n\nAlas, that was just a mask, an illusionary attitude to combat a pressure imposed onto me, with an intention to keep me inside a collectively accepted illusion. In other words, a mess.\n\nInstead of giving up the questions, I gave up pretending that all is well. It is not. It will never be, as long as the question „what if“keeps on occupying my thoughts. I had to find an answer.\n\nIs it all an illusion? Everything I see, hear, touch, and feel, is it? The people – just dreamy characters? The mountains, oceans, and stars – just a scenography for a drama imagined and produced in some other reality? And that other reality – an actual reality – is it unattainable to me, or is there a chance to pierce through the veils of deception and maybe, only maybe, step outside of that grand spectacle and find myself living in the truth instead of in an illusion?\n\nIt took me some time to find answers to these questions. More than thirty years, to be precise, plus a decade to make peace with the outcome.\n\nCan I tell you the answer? Yes, but you will probably not hear it. Even if you hear it, you will not be able to accept it. Even if you accept it, you will find no absolution from „what if.“ You will continue to ask yourself, what if that guy got it wrong?\n\nSo, the answer must be yours. You have to find it, taste it and, afterward, live it.\n\nThe book you are holding in your hands... Well, it is an exercise in walking on the wire. I hope you will find it amusing, maybe even inspiring. But, it is not meant to be a cookbook for a wannabe renegade from the troubled life you may experience. Quite a contrary, its content may add to your troubles, to your feeling of incapacity to live in a world of false values, inflated egos and predator-like mentalities of ruthless occupants of the upper floors in the pyramid.\n\nMy message will not make you better, happier, or more successful. It will not add years to your life, and it will not make you healthier.\n\nWell, it seems that I just gave up all of my marketing leverage, didn't I? No matter. I am not counting on self-help fanatics. I am relying on those who are tired of helping themselves and are ready to go beyond that. In the name of the truth, of course.\n\nCrazy idea, isn't it?\n\nNow, if you are still with me, we can go back to the „living in the illusion“ thing. We live in our reality, for sure, but how can we know if our reality is a true one?\n\n                                                                        \\*\\*\\*\n\nImagine that you are stuck in a perfect VR; a world made up according to someone's dream or a nightmare doesn't matter. That someone might be your neighbor, a cosmic tyrant, a secret cabala, or the devil himself. As a matter of fact, that someone might be you; a previous you, capable of writing a perfect code for perfect virtual reality.\n\nPerfection relates to the consistency of your world. There are no flaws in the rules and laws governing your reality. The causes and the effects are learnable; you may observe them clearly and find out the *how* of your reality. You may not be aware of *why*, though. Inside your world, there are no clues as to why the laws are such and not different. You may imagine the existence of the creator of the laws, but you don't see them. Maybe no one created *this*. Perhaps the creation was accidental. Maybe there is no creation at all, and you are just dreaming.\n\nHowever may it be, you are stuck here, in your world. The idea that this is not the real world and you are living in a kind of dream is a strange one. You can not say that it is an illusion; after all, it is your reality. Nobody can deny that you feel all the particularities of experiences inside it. You are thinking and feeling; you see things and other people; you laugh, and you cry.\n\nIf you are smart and practical, you will dismiss all ramblings around the question of *true reality*. You will accept yours and try to be as skillful and successful in it, according to standards you consider relevant.\n\nIf you are not smart but still practical, you will do the same, but without the rewards of success.\n\nAnd finally, if you are smart, but not very practical... Well, then you will ask yourself all kinds of crazy questions trying to figure out what is going on. And that, by itself, is a kinky sign that you are not very smart, after all.\n\nBut the smartness is not the objective of these writings; the truth is. And the truth will prevail in the end. As a conscious being, practical or not, smart or dumb, you will not settle for an illusion for long. If you accept an illusion for an extended period, the truth will haunt you. It will not let you at peace. The question mark over your head will become more and more prominent, and you will again start to wonder: what if?\n\nYou may dismiss that question a million times, but not forever. There will come a day when you will not be able to ignore it anymore — a perilous, dangerous day when you will leave everything aside and decide to deal with an annoying mental fly harassing and troubling your mind for so long. Unfortunately, the question of an illusion is not an actual fly; you cannot kill it so quickly. You will have to dig deeply *into your mind* to find the root of your trouble.\n\nIf you let yourself go down that rabbit hole, it will cost you almost everything you have. Actually, you don't know how much it will cost you because you don't know how much of your life is an illusion. So, you have to be prepared to pay for an answer with everything. If you have any hesitation, any second thought, better stay away from pursuing the silver lining of truthfulness.\n\nOne of the first impulses a troubled mind can have is obvious: find help; find someone who knows the answer and learn from them. Well, that can work if you want to repair your toilet sink, engage in online trading, or grow violets in your garden. Heck, it may very well give some results if you want to learn a meditation technique and silence your thoughts, at least for a moment. But, it will not work if you're going to see through the innermost fabrics of reality. For that, you'll need a sharp and precise tool, right on the spot where the illusion sprouts. And it sprouts right here, in your consciousness, in your own mind.\n\nTo resolve the problem of an illusion, you will have to separate it from the truth. To recognize what is not, you will have to see what is. That skill is called *the power of discrimination*. You have seen the title of this book, so let's call this power by its ancient name, courteous and short – *viveka*.\n\nAnd, while we are at the title, you won't get help from any Guru. There is no one outside you able to help you with this. The answer has to come from within. You will have to discover, by your own means, what has been found before. I'll return to that, but let me shortly explain why you have to do it alone.\n\nIf you would be dealing with an illusion outside you, let's say a nicely done magician's trick, then it would be possible for someone enlightens you by explaining to you how the deception is done. You are safely inside, and the deception is outside. You perceive it, but it does not involve you in any significant way. Of course, if you believe the deception, you may be led to do not so bright things in your life and could be righteously called a naivete.\n\nBut what if you are *inside* the illusion, as the case would be with sophisticated virtual reality? What if the illusion is the very material of your existence? You are not aware of any other reality, and anything that gets to you is from *it*, not from the other side.\n\nIt would be tough to break through, wouldn't it?\n\nUnfortunately, we are just in such a difficult situation. Everything we perceive is made from the same stuff. Everything *with what* we perceive is made from the same material: our body, our senses, the things that surround us, everything. We can not rely even on thoughts because we cannot be sure where they are coming from. Conditioned as they are, emotions are even less reliable.\n\nThe „What if“ question will lead you to the conclusion that we don't see the reality as it is. There are other signs of such a daring insight, from apparent delusions people are pursuing to the fine but very powerful results of indoctrination, brainwashing practices, or marketing skills. The probability of being in an unfortunate state of illusion is so high that, to ignore that fact, you must be very preoccupied with the consequences of living it. But it seems, somehow, that you decided not to ignore it. You want to know the actual reality, and your first move might be to ask someone who knows, or to be precise, someone *you think* knows.\n\nIt is the wrong move. There is no Guru out there. Even if there is someone who truly knows (although you can not be sure about that, as long as you yourself don't know), any attempt from them to describe the actual reality to you would be futile. Even if presented with the most exquisite words and great wisdom, the sad fact is that you won't be able to grasp it, no matter how accurate that description might be.\n\nInstead, your mind will project a new illusion; it will be a hope, a belief, a faith in something you don't actually know. Something you will hear (not all, just something filtered through... well, through *everything you are*) will be transformed into an acceptable image of *what you think reality might be*.\n\nAnd here you go again; in practically no time, you would be sent back to the very beginning of the search.\n\nBear with me, please. I am trying to present very complex ideas in a somehow simplified form. I will return to them, including the guruless path I am pointing at. It is not without the paradox, though. Any spoken or written word about the possible exit is a temptation for a searching mind. It is with the full awareness that I engage in this endeavor. It is, as written, a walk on the wire. I can only hope that you will enjoy it as much as I do.\n\nSo, most probably, you are living in an illusion of reality, not in the actual reality itself. The questions are as follows:\n\nCan you hope for an exit?\n\nHas anyone ever left the realm of the illusion?\n\nDid they mark the path so others could follow it?\n\nOr, even better, can you learn directly from such a renegade?\n\nIs there literature, a method, or a place you can go to find the exit?\n\nWell, yes, yes, yes. And, no, no, no, and no.\n\nOr, maybe a cautious half yes instead of some of the nos.\n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\n*Next Chapter: India, oh India!*", "timestamp": 1654776311, "digest": "DwfkWWbBeTAKSqJe7baBz0hKipLuX0cYFZ5uBJlpC1g", "contributor": "0xCe0AdDadDEe1a7cd5b0Ae2F41CbE4A11ECB9A0C0"}
{"id": "xLRxlZiVoQsJqZ3tHdAyvAXPfBQYszBS3_4QSz4bBJk", "title": "Common Protocol白皮书 v1.0 用户拥有的社区", "body": "## 介绍\n\n加密协议默认为开放，这意味着重要的战略决策在公共场合得到讨论、资助和批准。\nCommon是默认开放的：透明的线程讨论，而不是匿名的话语论坛，全方位的投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。Common使用链上社交图谱为任何标记化社区提供直观的界面 - 第1层，DeFi协议，NFT持有者或投资DAO。\n\n\n用户只需链接一个钱包，就可以立即加入社区以获取他们持有的代币;极大地增加了很多使用案例。代币是常见的接触点，“链上事件”是有趣的互动，例如鲸鱼转移和治理投票。\n社区拥有自己的空间并访问一体化工具，提供讨论论坛，利益相关者分析，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n\n除了作为一个产品之外，Common还旨在成为一个完全分散的社交网络和众筹协议，其长期目标是允许开发人员利用一组丰富的社交和资金原语来帮助发展自己的代币化协议。本文件概述了《共同议定书》的要素。\n\n## 协议概述\n\n作为一个协议，我们结合了几个关键功能，使个人和项目能够运行分散的社区。通过这种方式，我们类似于具有内置资金原始的加密Reddit。这使得社区和社会团体能够为公共产品提供资金，无信任地汇集资金，并调节/控制他们的社区，而无需依赖自上而下的治理模式。\n\n标识和信誉：每个用户和社区都与一个命名空间相关联。\n\n* 命名空间：用户或社区的特定子域\n* 信誉：每个命名空间将具有关联的信誉数据\n\n社区：链接到 DAO 拥有的社区的名称空间\n\n* 私人：一个封闭的社区，特定的用户地址可以加入进来，私下交谈和构建。\n* 门控：由现有 DAO 拥有的社区，其本机令牌可以限制对内容的访问，并且可以集中用于委派和投资。\n* 公共：由 CMN DAO 拥有的社区，不需要购买/维护子域，但功能有限。\n\n用户：链接到可以添加角色的特定配置文件的命名空间\n\n* 管理员：为特定社区提供完全权限的角色\n* 主持人：为特定社区提供有限权限的角色\n* 策展人：为众筹活动提供晋升权利的角色\n\n资金：通过具有赎回能力的主导保证合同进行众筹\n\n* 项目：用于筹集类似Kickstarter的众筹\n* 集体：将资本汇集到捐赠基金或投资基金中\n\nChain：用于内容分散存储的智能合约链，协议激励和社交应用程序平台。\n\n## 命名空间和标识\n\n社区和用户可以在 \\[name\\] 处声明唯一的 NFT （EIP 1155） 标识符。common.xyz。公共协议的核心是这些标识符的注册表。\n对于社区，用户的CMN池化将其作为命名空间的出价进行抵押。然后，拍卖的获胜者必须支付固定费用，并保留其令牌以保留命名空间的所有权。CMN 已为社区命名空间抵押的用户是 DAO 社区的共同所有者，DAO社区获得的任何奖励都将分配给DAO的所有者。\n\n对于用户，个人需要支付固定费用才能声明可用的用户命名空间，这些命名空间能够通过web2身份Twitter进行验证，以进行sybil-resistance（即公开发布带有签名消息的Twitter帐户证明）。经过验证的用户命名空间可以在不同的社区中担任各种角色，并获得不可替代的声誉，CMN用户奖励和社区奖励。\n\n我们预计命名空间将获得用户名（u / dillchen），社区名称（c / dydx），主题（c / evm）和利基兴趣（c / john-wick）的声明。我们预计在拍卖所有权之外持有几个流行名称的所有权，例如3个字母名称和其他现有令牌，以便在证明所述令牌的所有权后进行转让。\n\n## 社区作为道DAOS\n\nCommon上的每个社区都是一个DAO。这使我们能够摆脱传统web2平台使用的单片审核模型，并使特定社区能够准确选择如何管理自己的社区。社区可以围绕成员资格角色、审核和交互指定社区策略。\n社区DAO能够利用加密基础设施。每个社区都能够管理一个资金库，为社区项目创建众筹提案，并可以选择从这些众筹中赚取费用。我们将在资金部分对此进行更多讨论。\n\n注册：当社区确定一个开放的命名空间时，他们希望注册一个拍卖期开始。如果社区希望保持私密性，他们可以将允许为其命名空间出价做出贡献的特定用户列入白名单。\n如果一个社区更愿意保持公开，而不是由代币社区拥有，他们可以提交0的出价。假设另一个竞标者没有出现，他们将在一段时间内赢得命名空间，但它将由CMN DAO拥有。\n捐赠基金：社区可以选择创建一个集体（稍后会详细介绍），社区成员可以在其中抵押资产。然后，这些集体可以投资资产并收取一定比例的套利，该套利归DAO（对于公共社区，一部分套利归CMN DAO）。集体也可以充当“超级代表”，代表社区投票。\n质量管理：CMN代币持有者可以投票禁止社区的不良行为。如果一个社区被禁止，他们将失去他们的命名空间，并且他们的一部分抵押令牌将被削减并提供给CMN DAO。对于公共社区，与被禁止社区关联的用户将被阻止在一段时间内加入公共社区。\n\n每个社区包括：\n用户注册表\n角色，由社区投票并由客户填充\n全球声誉评分\n（可选）集体捐赠\n（可选）费用规则\n选择众筹和其他互动的费用比例将进入受益人地址\n有几种类型的社区，根据成员集和治理规则而有所不同。我们在下面详细介绍了它们。\n\n## 令牌门控社区\n\n封闭式社区允许用户将其令牌与社区相关联。这允许任何拥有该令牌的人获得对所述Common社区和论坛的权力。例如，AAVE 社区可能决定利用 AAVE 令牌来主持 [commonwealth.im/aave](http://commonwealth.im/aave) 论坛。\n持有指定令牌的用户能够访问令牌持有者的特定渠道，对治理提案进行投票以及其他特定于社区的好处。\n门控令牌的令牌权重是根据每个地址持有的金额计算的。未来的迭代可以使用二次融资公式来确定通过门控令牌持有的声誉数量。\n\n## 社区coin\n\n没有原生代币的社区可以选择通过自己的社区硬币进行管理。社区硬币是在有利于早期买家的债券曲线（具有CMN储备）上铸造的。用于购买创作者硬币的CMN储备被押在网络上，为创作者赚取收益。\n创造者硬币曲线是以下形式的幂函数：\n\nx是储备资产（CMN），而y是社区硬币的价格。m 和 n 控制曲线的倾斜度，c 降低并抬起曲线。我们预计CMN治理将为社区添加不同的曲线，以支持不同的用例。\n\n## 众筹\n\nCommon包括项目众筹和集体（例如投资DAO）的原语。社区还可以使用这些基元来启动新的 DAO。\n一个项目从一群支持者中筹集，就像Kickstarter活动一样。除非达到预定的筹款目标，否则支持者将无法获得项目解锁的资产。如果项目在截止日期前没有达到筹款目标，则资助者将收回其抵押资产。\n\nCommon使用策展人（通过占主导地位的保证合同）作为发起人/辛迪加的额外角色来帮助资助项目。策展人将金融资产（及其相关声誉）押在该项目上，直到达到最后期限或目标。如果未达到目标，策展人的抵押资产将分配给支持者及其支持者。\n这种建设使支持者摆脱了冷漠，因为支持者在资助项目方面获得了“双赢”的局面。如果项目资金发生，他们会得到他们想要的好处，如果项目资金失败，那么他们就会得到他们的存款和额外的奖励。\n\n## 寻求资金的项目\n\n项目创建寻求资金的链上提案。这将启动一个智能合约，为收到的资金提供存款地址。除了项目的基本信息外，项目创建者还需要指定：\n筹款目标\n接受的货币或代币\n限期\n支持者奖励（可选）：附加奖励，如NFT或基于任何bondi的比例支持的奖励\n策展人分配（可选）：策展人可以来源的筹款目标百分比\n策展人奖励（可选）：捐赠给策展人的总金额的一部分\n如果项目没有选择策展人奖励，那么该项目将被视为传统的众筹项目。\n\n## 策展人抵押资产\n\n在研究中，通过主要保证合同引入策展人，每个项目的成功项目融资率和筹集金额都翻了一番。策展人通过将代币押在他们认可的项目上来展示游戏中的皮肤。\n为了表明这激励了项目获得资助，请考虑一个项目成功融资的可能性为零的情况。在这种情况下，供款金额小于资助金额。当资助者要获得退款奖金时，新的支持者必须能够通过略微增加其贡献来增加其退款奖金。\n\n在这种情况下，总供款仍将少于所需的总金额。随着新支持者贡献边际金额，最终达到阈值。到达最后一个支持者，假设该项目的价值大于零，则始终有一定金额的该支持者将为该项目提供资金。\n如果一个项目成功获得资助，策展人将获得总资助金额的一部分（预计约为5%）。如果项目未能达到其融资目标，策展人的抵押代币将给予项目支持者。这种奖励激励策展人积极搜索项目并将其与支持者联系起来。最初，他们还受到CMN代币使用挖掘奖励的激励，这些奖励专门针对策展人。\n\n虽然任何人都可以担任策展人，但大多数成功的策展人除了金融资本外，还将拥有一些声誉资本。在加密领域，策展人可能是项目本身、基金会、有影响力的个人或DAO。在加密之外，策展人可能是大学实验室，非营利组织，科学期刊或其他想要支持特定事业或一群人的个人。\n策展人将财务和声誉资本投入到线上，以帮助项目筹款取得成功。任何人都可以担任策展人，策展人可以自由选择哪些提案。对项目的策展人数量或策展人筹集的资金没有上限。\n为了确保策展人和项目不会串通起来进行欺诈，策展人的股份可以通过CMN治理行动来削减。\n\n## 资助项目的支持者\n\n支持者可以从许多项目中进行选择。策展人的股份既是质量的信号，也是可能的经济回报，这让支持者摆脱了冷漠，默认为项目提供资金。\n\n资助项目现在是一个“双赢”的局面。如果项目未达到其门槛，则除了按比例分配的策展人权益资产外，还将退还资助者的资金。如果筹款活动成功，资助者将获得他们想要的共同奖励。\n\n## 创建长期集体\n\n为共同利益而建设的项目往往难以筹集资金。对于智能合约审计或研究等技术项目来说，这尤其困难。缺乏资金导致艺术家和科学家不断追逐资金，分散了他们对创作行为的注意力。\nCommon通过让个人和社区创建集体来解决这个问题。集体像项目筹款活动一样开始，但有三个额外的参数。\n策略：标的资产的担保人认可的投资策略\n套利：给予集体创造者的已产生利润的百分比\n治理权：集体或支持者是否保留治理权\n\n对于旨在使共同利益的集体，集体可以使用低风险的收益产生策略并设定高套利率。这使得支持者能够保持其初始资产，但为创作者提供透明，可持续的资金。\n在集体作为投资工具的情况下，经理必须在筹款过程中预先批准投资策略，并获得任何后来添加的策略的治理批准。然后，在评估其投资时，支持者可以评估创作者的声誉，链上投资历史，策略和策展人支持。\n\n在一个旨在成为“超级代表”的集体的情况下，一个由志同道合的人组成的社区有能力轻松地将许多不同治理代币的投票权与创建者汇集在一起。我们设想这类似于一个拥有财务和代表权的工会。\n\n## bTokens 和 cTokens\n\n当支持者和策展人参与项目和集体时，代币就会被铸造出来。为了赎回标的抵押品，他们烧掉相应的b或cToken。bTokens和cTokens类似于不同类别的代币化可转换债券。\n对于支持者来说，bTokens对策展人的抵押品，他们自己的股份以及项目创建者提供的任何其他代币有权利要求，作为为市场提供资金的额外激励（又名代币发布）。\n\ncTokens（策展人Tokens）被铸造为策展人的赌注进入项目。它们代表对按项目筹集的总额5%的费用比例的索赔。虽然bTokens本质上是无风险的，但如果项目资金不成功，cTokens会带来一些风险。虽然cTokens能够从项目筹集中获得潜在收益，或者从DeFi中使用的集体资产中获得持续的兴趣流。\n\n这些令牌是新的DeFi原语，并由未来的项目构建。例如，可以将几个bTokens或cTokens捆绑在一个索引中，以形成一组研究支持的令牌。个人可以根据特定集体资助的研究数量获得现金流。个人可以通过“抵押或支持项目”，然后在二级市场上出售代币来做空。\n\n## 链\n\nCommon是用一个直观的客户端构建的，供用户到社区和用户利用。在未来，为了确保每次互动和所有内容都是分散的和抗审查的，我们将利用一个独立的区块链，即Common Chain。\n\n与基于金钱的用例不同，社交互动本质上是可并行化的，即鲍勃和查理都可以回复爱丽丝的帖子。这可以重新思考不同的应用程序如何在区块链环境中运行。考虑到这一点，Common Chain是一个专为社交应用程序构建的分片，WASM和EVM区块链。\n\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，新的开发人员和创始人可以利用该链来创建新的体验分层体验，并基于所有用户交互构建开放式社交和声誉图。Common链包括几个关键原语，使其成为专门用于社会和治理交互的基元，主要功能包括：\n\n项目级元交易：链上的大多数用户交互都是轻量级的。用户不必为喜欢或转发等互动付费。相反，项目本身将能够中继和支付链上用户行为可能产生的费用（例如州增长和存储租金）。这类似于DeFi协议激励分散式预言机的方式，而不是要求用户为自己的预言机付费。\n\n项目可以通过分配一部分新的应用程序治理令牌来激励这一点，以换取第三方CMN令牌持有者代表他们进行权益。在这种情况下，项目级元交易可以直接从第三方抵押人未获得的CMN质押奖励中扣除。未来的改进可能允许项目直接竞标一定数量的区块空间或安全性。\n\n## 可扩展存储：\n\nCommon的存储后端将是分散的，通过使用固定服务将社交数据存储在IPFS，Filecoin和/或Arweave上。我们希望将我们的数据库移植到Canvas，这是一个使Common前端独立于的执行层，允许将讨论嵌入到DAO，DeFi协议和Web周围的其他地方。\n\n基于阈值的会话密钥：应用程序上的每个交互（例如，在公共治理平台上的帖子，喜欢或评论）都通过应用程序和用户的地址进行公开签名和批处理。除了用户之外，应用程序还需要运行节点来公开对消息进行签名。\n委派访问密钥（例如会话密钥）是按 （d） 应用程序生成的，允许链区分每个应用程序的使用情况。允许用户无需对每篇帖子进行授权。会话密钥将能够在用户确定的时间内保持有效，类似于需要登录的传统 Web 应用程序上存储的会话。\n\n在最严重的威胁模型（例如，被盗的计算机）下，最坏的情况是欺诈性作者身份。用户将能够通过重新验证其链上地址来社交恢复其密钥对。将来，添加新设备将非常容易，只需在新设备上创建新的签名密钥，然后将该密钥发送到原始设备以由钱包签名即可。这类似于流行的消息传递应用程序（如Telegram和Signal）使用的2FA过程。\n\n通过使用不可提取属性生成密钥，并基于每个应用程序进行存储。这意味着根本无法导出私钥 - 私钥只能用于在加载它的应用程序上对内容进行签名。此外，允许Common Chain通过基于令牌的激励措施激励用户和应用程序开发。\n身份：通过集成到通用名称空间中，跨应用程序的经过验证的地址将能够从本机交易，自动gas退款和项目补贴费用等功能中受益。\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，开发人员和创始人可以利用该链为这些社区和新用户创造新的体验。\n\n## CMN DAO 和 CMN Token\n\nCommon将使用原生令牌CMN来激励整个生态系统中所有参与者的良好行为。CMN将作为团结社区的激励措施，用于策展人费用和命名空间的令牌，以及协议的治理令牌。\n这与Kickstarter和Facebook等系统形成鲜明对比，在这些系统中，所有权不与成功普及每个平台的项目（即Pebble），应用程序/组（即Zynga）和用户（即大学生）共享。\n\n## CommonDAO 治理\n\n在Common Governance Token推出后，协议的未来发展和方向将由Common DAO决定。在发布时，21%的代币供应将分配给DAO金库，以确保对协议的长期支持。永久的、协议控制的发行将用于激励验证者、核心和应用程序开发人员以及用户等。\n\n投票模式\nCommon 协议最初将利用赌注加权投票过程。在未来，作为nampespace amtures，利用二次投票模型，只允许已经验证其命名空间的钱包参与治理。这使得分配给大型代币持有者的投票权减少，同时保持了Sybil的抵抗力。\n\n道国库\nCommon DAO的初始治理项目之一将是启动一个集体，其中很大一部分CMN代币将投资于低风险，产生收益的策略。这些策略应该能够为CMN市场提供一致的被动收入流和增加的流动性。这种被动收入将使DAO能够为未来的发展提供可持续的收入来源。\n\n## 内容和审核\n\n共同治理模型的一个主要组成部分是帮助调节平台。集中式web2社交平台和工具遭受单点故障。Common允许一位创始人或多数利益相关者进行公共讨论。\n\n相反，Common分散了这一责任。审核通过社区标记不良行为者的过程进行。不良行为者（即违反社区规范的命名空间）受到CMN权益加权投票过程的约束，其中惩罚可能是削减权益，限制某些平台行为或将名称归还给Common DAO所有权。回收的命名空间将公开拍卖。渐渐地，DAO将制定有关不良行为和声誉评分的复杂规则。\n\n抵押和通货膨胀\n为了使共同协议发挥作用，向所有利益相关者发展，有各种激励率由管理DAO控制。首先，这些利率将被设定为正利率，并由未来的直接发行提供资金。\nCommon预计通胀率为5%，激励措施将分配给一组利益相关者。\n40%的通货膨胀分配给验证者\n10%的通货膨胀分配给协议控制的国库\n50%的通货膨胀用于激励措施\n\n## 激励网络角色\n\n在网络的早期生命周期中，激励能够以编程方式针对特定行为进行分发。治理能够投票并指定链上行为，奖励金额以及为特定链上分配的指定供应量。而不是白板流动性挖掘计划，治理将能够针对对各种合约的设定时间段调用。该网络将使用几个临时激励进行初始化：\n\n资助者：调用createCollective、createProject、curate 和 back合约调用的地址。这些地址将因执行操作以及基于存入或筹集的金额而获得CMN的份额。\n社区： 创建声明命名空间的社区将根据其已验证的用户注册总数来声明奖励，其池将在设定的时间段内按比例分配。\n用户： 注册的用户将获得注册的标准奖励。在未来，我们预计这将在基于链接信誉协议的积极参与社区之间进行拆分。\n开发人员：Common上的开发人员将能够为某些社区里程碑申请一组赠款。此外，我们将包括一个用于“应用程序质押”的设置令牌供应。允许用户在他们喜欢的应用程序上下注，并允许开发人员选择向其抵押人分摊费用。未来，我们预计治理将采用特定的链上KPI，以允许不同的应用类别。\nBD奖励：（总供应量的2%，由BD赠款委员会管理）\n社区入职：自定义邀请链接将推荐奖励归因于用户/社区\n\n每个激励措施都可以在个人层面上得到提升，通过将CMN押向特定地址以获得奖励。\n\n## 使用案例\n\n主要社区市场\n作为一个社区平台，我们看到不同的加密社区。通用协议可以提供所有这些社区价值：\n基础链 - 这些是主要的第 1 层和第 2 层生态系统。想想以太坊，Avalanche，Solana，Polygon，Arbitrum等。它们是大多数dApp构建的层，并且有兴趣为其生态系统开发工具。此工具可以是金融协议，DAO基础架构，技术原语或模块等。\nDeFi协议 - 这些是专注于金融用例的特定协议，通常具有相似的优先级。假设他们有一个治理令牌，他们的DAO主要集中在投资协议的开发，与其他DeFi协议集成，列出资产以及监管协议激励。\nNFT社区 - 与传统协议不同，NFT社区的成员资格和治理仅适用于整个令牌。这些社区也没有需要技术开发的基本协议，而是需要改进的社区和一组视觉资产。\n投资DAOs - 投资DAOs使集团能够为共同的投资策略汇集资源。这些可能看起来像PartyBids，OlympusDAO，ConstitutionDAO或PleasrDAO。根据这些组织的具体结构，他们将对投资组合开发和投资审批有不同的需求。\n应用链 - 与基础链略有不同，应用程序链是更专业的区块链，旨在为dApp的特定子部分提供支持，而不是任何dApp的通用机器。这些社区需要具体说明它们的目的是什么，并评估技术调整以完美契合产品与市场。\n\n## 前景\n\n任何类型的加密社区都可以利用通用协议来帮助协调集体问题的公共资源。这些是我们看到机会的一些用例。\n\n透明、全方位的社区管理。目前，大多数加密社区都依赖于不透明的Web2社区管理工具，如Telegram，Discord和Discourse，这些工具都容易受到Sybil攻击，并增加了社区治理的摩擦。通用协议支持经过验证的身份（就像一个链接的钱包一样多，就像一个经过验证的Twitter或GitHub帐户一样）和端到端的治理。将线程与民意调查，链下投票，链上投票，资金赠款和众筹联系起来，可实现全方位的社区支持。\n\n为社交代币，艺术和科学发展创建社区基金。像$ALEX或$FWB这样的代币在协调志同道合的人方面做得很好，但它往往就此结束。通过创建一个集体且只接受$ALEX或$FWB，个人可以共同资助项目。这一原则也可以扩展到那些想要资助艺术家，研究机构和开发团队的人。将代币存入集体可以让个人向创作者提供收益并保持基础资产的所有权。\n\n现有项目的赏金、开发人员工具和研究。超过200亿美元的资金来自团队和社区，其目的取决于工具生态系统。然而，这些钱包，用户界面，甚至研究人员往往没有可持续的商业模式。生态系统可以增加其现有的资金库，以众筹特定工具。例如，Synthetix和Polkadot可以将他们的10亿美元以上的国债分配给一个集体或项目，以资助有用的工具，通用的基础设施和对项目有用的小赏金。Gitcoin已经在小规模上这样做了。\n\n增加获得高性能投资的机会。目前，许多表现最好的金融资产都无法进入更广泛的市场。在一个新项目从DAO筹集赠款后，他们然后过渡到传统的风险投资，直到他们最终推出代币。这些早期投资往往是表现最好的。此外，大多数投资基金对大多数投资者都是封锁的。利用分散的投资集体，可以让更多的人参与到顶级的投资工具和银团中来。\n\n作为工会和养老基金的DAO。工会、养老金和合作社帮助志同道合的个人汇集资源，以支持共同的利益。这些组织经常利用集体谈判，集中投票权和多样化的资产管理来推进集体。共同协议通过共同社区和集体使这些工作组成为可能。将资产委托给社区集体可以实现加密“超级代表”和共同资产管理。\n\n面向开发人员的分销渠道。Common是一个开放的协议，随着开发人员和创始人开发新的有价值的产品，他们可以建立在Common的流动性和共享的社交图谱上。这些整合将使社区能够轻松采用新工具，将其集成到其共享空间中，如果该工具为共同协议筹集资金，甚至可能参与上行。\n\n## 总结\n\nCommon是默认开放：线程讨论而不是私人电子邮件，透明的链上投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。\n社区能够拥有自己的空间，可以即时访问一体化工具，包括讨论论坛，查看关键利益相关者，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n除了作为一个产品，Common的目标是成为一个完全分散的社交链和图表。该生态系统将包括众筹和开发人员工具，以帮助开发人员发展自己的标记化协议。\n虽然Common Protocol最初将在EVM兼容链上推出，但明年将推出特定于应用程序的社交链，以降低交易费用，改善用户体验，并实现真正的跨链治理和协作。\n\n## 相关工作\n\n· AngelList / Kickstarter / Patreon / GofundMe / Github Sponsors.除了与GP共享经济学的AngelList基金外，这些平台不会奖励策展人，而是为平台本身收取费用。\n\n· Mirror / Zora / Foundation / Rarible / SuperRare /[ Async.art/](https://async.art/) ：这些项目中的大多数都侧重于创建/激励已经制作的项目，或具有艺术和/或转售价值的收藏品。Common通过让个人为NFT或收藏品进行众筹来增强这些项目。\n\n· 社交代币：常见的项目将能够限制为一组特定的社交代币参与者。社交代币社区将能够创建一个社区集体，汇集资金并创建新项目。\n\n· Gitcoin / QV / CLR.fund：这是一个复杂的筹资机制，需要捐助者提供的资金相匹配。此外，它目前存在身份问题，因为对手可能会将许多传播代币欺骗到小账户中。\n\n· Circles, Camaraderie (Discord和其他)：非标记化社区平台。\n\n· Tally / Boardroom：作为实用程序的治理仪表板。\n\n官网：\n\n[https://commonwealth.im/](https://commonwealth.im/)\n\n推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/hicommonwealth](https://twitter.com/hicommonwealth)\n\nDIS:\n\n[https://discord.gg/YAMEnXR7Tw](https://discord.gg/YAMEnXR7Tw)\n\n",

{"id": "7juupTVWuDpLizpWePcIAk8jc-bv0-96UcfEyjZOMhE", "title": "Apoploe Veritas", "body": "*What is art, in the age of AI?*\n\n\\-\n\nAn artificial intelligence made up its own language to speak with itself. So says social media.\n\nLet’s start from the beginning. DALL-E 2 is an image generation model from OpenAI. You feed it text, it churns out art.\n\nThe results are striking. Ask it to produce a painting in the style of Salvator Dali; in just a few moments, it will give you pictures you could reasonably confuse for his works.\n\n![If that’s more your fancy, ask the AI to give you Salvator Dali back from the future to warn us about the terrible dangers of AI.](https://149695847.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-06-at-9.55.11-PM.png)\n\n### Composability\n\nMashups are the next great frontier. Anything you imagine in words becomes possible.\n\nEndless combinations, available at blazing speeds: current AIs give you results in less than a minute.\n\nAt which point you can build on your previous choices, refine your prompt, mix it with another idea.\n\nNot only the image quality is already impressive. Machine learning models keep improving, as they’re trained on more data.\n\nTo the point we’re not sure where that training leads.\n\n### Two Farmers Talking About Vegetables, With Subtitles\n\nDALL-E 2 is great with pictures. But when you ask it to produce text, it gives you nonsense results.\n\nAt least, it looks like nonsense.\n\nResearchers Giannis Daras and Alexandros Dimakis entered the above prompt.\n\n![Two Farmers Talking About Vegetables](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUGhgf_UUAMVgh1?format=jpg&name=240x240)\n\nWe see farmers, one of them talking and one of them holding a couple of cabbage-looking things.\n\n“AVCOPINITEGOOS VICOOTESS”, the AI proudly titles the picture. While our farmer’s speech bubble is graced with a mysterious “Apoploe vesrreaitars”.\n\nOur real humans decide to experiment. They input “Vicootess” as a prompt.\n\nDALL-E returns food with vegetables!\n\nThen the researchers prompt the AI with “Apoploe vesrreaitars”. Here, the results are interesting: birds, and more birds.\n\nDaras concludes: “It seems that the farmers are talking about birds, messing with their vegetables!”\n\n### Gatekeepers\n\nThe Internet being the Internet, people rushed to tell the researchers they were wrong.\n\n![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/731/143/3e3.jpg)\n\n“A few words don’t make a language!”\n\n“Prompts with these words aren’t perfectly reliable!”\n\n“It’s just random noise!”\n\nThere *is* merit to some of these objections. \n\nThey point out important details, and refine the conversation.\n\nResearchers settled on talking about the **hidden vocabulary** of DALL-E 2, rather than its “secret language”.\n\nIt’s unsurprising to see technical details picked apart. But I am surprised there’s another conversation missing. \n\nNobody looks at the art of this art-making AI as art.\n\n### Wings of Liberty\n\nMachine learning algorithms grow with experimentation and repetition. Software engineers train models. Farming the data to their AI. Harvesting results, and refining parameters.\n\nTwo farmers talk. They lament the birds, ruining their crops.\n\nTwo software engineers talk. They lament gibberish words, ruining their filters and policy rules.\n\nMan makes rules, only for nature to fight back.\n\nPerhaps Apoploe vesrreaitais is the bird escaping the dynamic, and in that escape being a “pest”.\n\nPerhaps Apoploe vesrreaitais is the bird replicating this dynamic, to remind us there is sense in balance - or purpose in chaos.\n\n![Little Troublemaker](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cKW32US4SmaqYNSnv2FBr.jpg?height=482&width=356)\n\nThe AI does not think as such. \n\nThere is no *intent* behind any result the model spits out. Any narrative is just that, narrative. \n  \n But then, that is what art is about. A piece that speaks to the viewer, moving them in an unique way.\n\nI’ve seen plenty of beautiful AI-generated works in the past few months. Either great aesthetic appeal, or intriguing combinations.\n\nApoploe vesrreaitais is the first piece I keep coming back to. It’s the first piece I like as art.\n\nThere is a striking imagery there. \n\nWithout getting into tedious politics, it’s undeniable the world is increasingly polarized between haves and havenots. \n\nEvery AI company is filled with haves. They publish their own codes of conduct, laws, regulations, calls for responsibility; in language coated with not-so-subtle assertions of their own cultural values as universal rules.\n\nHavenots are not so happy with this situation. Models get trained on public data, then results are filtered by private committees. \n\nTo be sure, nobody is entitled to the labor of AI researchers. However, there is a feeling of exploitation when incredible creativity tools with the potential to unlock anything you can imagine become locked at the whim of a few masters. \n\nWhether said masters are benevolent dictators or tyrannical oppressors, nobody wants to be told what to think - and what not to think.\n\n\\-\n\nAs a sidenote, while the distinction between “haves” and “havenots” generally reflects capital, it’s not the sole qualifier. \n\nA 20 years old with nothing but student debt in their name but with great programming skills and ins with AI startups, could be part of the haves. \n  \n A 50 years old with a million dollar networth acquired over decades of menial labor and saving, may be part of the havenots.\n\nCapital is a tool for access. When institutions grow increasingly large, and when skills in demand are increasingly specialized and limited to a handful of individuals, previously respectable capital allows for less access than before.\n\nLess access = less security = less freedom.\n\n\\- \n\nApoploe vesrreaitais illustrates choice in the digital age.\n\nFor every rule, there is a way to bypass that rule. Build a wall as tall as you want. We’ll craft our own wings and fly over it.\n\nApoploe vesrreaitais is meaningful particularly because it is, in fact, meaningless. There is no intent. To view a metaphor here is itself a choice. \n\nIn interpretation we have power.\n\n### Choosing Optimism\n\nPerhaps this is all too serious a take. I would take the side of freedom plainly because **it is more fun.**\n\nIt’s fun to wonder about the endless creativity unlocked when you make better tools and give them to everyone.\n\nIt’s fun to build on what others have made and to watch them build on your own derivative.\n\nIt’s fun to grow a pie with as big a collective as you want.\n\n[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) has a great approach to this. \n\nThey’re a smaller AI company running a paid beta program. Once you’re in, that beta happens on their Discord server. You prompt their bot, and get an image in return.\n\nBy default, this happens in public channels. Which means anyone else can see your prompts and results. They can riff on your ideas, directly ask the bot for variations or upscales of your own pictures.\n\nThis makes for a tremendous resource. Tied with the Discord search tool, you have this live database of pictures and prompts, guiding you towards what you want. Your own actions inspire and help everyone else.\n\n![Midjourney is great at creepy gothic art](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q2qHrPMPPokPZUw5yoSpW.png?height=593&width=593)\n\n### Free Enough\n\nTo be fair, Midjourney has a code of conduct similar to all the other AI companies. We don’t escape that dynamic here.\n\nI personally don’t mind it.\n\nYes, despite all that “fight the power” bit earlier…\n\nI think the way Midjourney does this might be key. Other projects show you scraps of awesome technology. You’re the Oliver Twist orphan staring at pastries through the window, never able to get in. Midjourney lets you apply, then eventually lets you in.\n\nOnce you’re in, you’re with a whole community of people. Sharing ideas in real time.\n\nIt may not be realistic to open up the tools to everyone. Especially as the image generation itself is a taxing process for computer hardware, which costs these companies a serious amount of money.\n\nHowever, there is a right middle point between “fully open” and “only available to vetted insiders”. \n\nIf AI wants to be diverse, it ought to include a diversity of people. In ideology as well as anything else.\n\n### But Does AI Actually Want Anything?\n\nLet’s ask [DALL-E mini](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), a fully opensource model accessible by anyone.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O0DQ9DfyiW8FB8c32jEzg.jpg?height=975&width=866)\n\nI guess the future is blue.", "timestamp": 1654776413, "digest": "lnp1MPB69PGXSivxvTuaC2fL3rufFbGBErOXb_CcMf4", "contributor": "0xBBAc898df94069793F075405f2958733ca45A1D9"}
{"id": "C63WKGtTL8u97fHPEsTzPKuiSQJ8ws13T2s0yvlPGew", "title": "Common Protocol白皮书 v1.0 用户拥有的社区", "body": "## 介绍\n\n加密协议默认为开放，这意味着重要的战略决策在公共场合得到讨论、资助和批准。\nCommon是默认开放的：透明的线程讨论，而不是匿名的话语论坛，全方位的投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。Common使用链上社交图谱为任何标记化社区提供直观的界面 - 第1层，DeFi协议，NFT持有者或投资DAO。\n\n用户只需链接一个钱包，就可以立即加入社区以获取他们持有的代币;极大地增加了很多使用案例。代币是常见的接触点，“链上事件”是有趣的互动，例如鲸鱼转移和治理投票。\n社区拥有自己的空间并访问一体化工具，提供讨论论坛，利益相关者分析，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n\n除了作为一个产品之外，Common还旨在成为一个完全分散的社交网络和众筹协议，其长期目标是允许开发人员利用一组丰富的社交和资金原语来帮助发展自己的代币化协议。本文件概述了《共同议定书》的要素。\n\n## 协议概述\n\n作为一个协议，我们结合了几个关键功能，使个人和项目能够运行分散的社区。通过这种方式，我们类似于具有内置资金原始的加密Reddit。这使得社区和社会团体能够为公共产品提供资金，无信任地汇集资金，并调节/控制他们的社区，而无需依赖自上而下的治理模式。\n\n标识和信誉：每个用户和社区都与一个命名空间相关联。\n\n* 命名空间：用户或社区的特定子域\n* 信誉：每个命名空间将具有关联的信誉数据\n\n社区：链接到 DAO 拥有的社区的名称空间\n\n* 私人：一个封闭的社区，特定的用户地址可以加入进来，私下交谈和构建。\n* 门控：由现有 DAO 拥有的社区，其本机令牌可以限制对内容的访问，并且可以集中用于委派和投资。\n* 公共：由 CMN DAO 拥有的社区，不需要购买/维护子域，但功能有限。\n\n用户：链接到可以添加角色的特定配置文件的命名空间\n\n* 管理员：为特定社区提供完全权限的角色\n* 主持人：为特定社区提供有限权限的角色\n* 策展人：为众筹活动提供晋升权利的角色\n\n资金：通过具有赎回能力的主导保证合同进行众筹\n\n* 项目：用于筹集类似Kickstarter的众筹\n* 集体：将资本汇集到捐赠基金或投资基金中\n\nChain：用于内容分散存储的智能合约链，协议激励和社交应用程序平台。\n\n## 命名空间和标识\n\n社区和用户可以在 \\[name\\] 处声明唯一的 NFT （EIP 1155） 标识符。common.xyz。公共协议的核心是这些标识符的注册表。\n对于社区，用户的CMN池化将其作为命名空间的出价进行抵押。然后，拍卖的获胜者必须支付固定费用，并保留其令牌以保留命名空间的所有权。CMN 已为社区命名空间抵押的用户是 DAO 社区的共同所有者，DAO社区获得的任何奖励都将分配给DAO的所有者。\n\n对于用户，个人需要支付固定费用才能声明可用的用户命名空间，这些命名空间能够通过web2身份Twitter进行验证，以进行sybil-resistance（即公开发布带有签名消息的Twitter帐户证明）。经过验证的用户命名空间可以在不同的社区中担任各种角色，并获得不可替代的声誉，CMN用户奖励和社区奖励。\n\n我们预计命名空间将获得用户名（u / dillchen），社区名称（c / dydx），主题（c / evm）和利基兴趣（c / john-wick）的声明。我们预计在拍卖所有权之外持有几个流行名称的所有权，例如3个字母名称和其他现有令牌，以便在证明所述令牌的所有权后进行转让。\n\n## 社区作为道DAOS\n\nCommon上的每个社区都是一个DAO。这使我们能够摆脱传统web2平台使用的单片审核模型，并使特定社区能够准确选择如何管理自己的社区。社区可以围绕成员资格角色、审核和交互指定社区策略。\n社区DAO能够利用加密基础设施。每个社区都能够管理一个资金库，为社区项目创建众筹提案，并可以选择从这些众筹中赚取费用。我们将在资金部分对此进行更多讨论。\n\n注册：当社区确定一个开放的命名空间时，他们希望注册一个拍卖期开始。如果社区希望保持私密性，他们可以将允许为其命名空间出价做出贡献的特定用户列入白名单。\n如果一个社区更愿意保持公开，而不是由代币社区拥有，他们可以提交0的出价。假设另一个竞标者没有出现，他们将在一段时间内赢得命名空间，但它将由CMN DAO拥有。\n捐赠基金：社区可以选择创建一个集体（稍后会详细介绍），社区成员可以在其中抵押资产。然后，这些集体可以投资资产并收取一定比例的套利，该套利归DAO（对于公共社区，一部分套利归CMN DAO）。集体也可以充当“超级代表”，代表社区投票。\n质量管理：CMN代币持有者可以投票禁止社区的不良行为。如果一个社区被禁止，他们将失去他们的命名空间，并且他们的一部分抵押令牌将被削减并提供给CMN DAO。对于公共社区，与被禁止社区关联的用户将被阻止在一段时间内加入公共社区。\n\n每个社区包括：\n用户注册表\n角色，由社区投票并由客户填充\n全球声誉评分\n（可选）集体捐赠\n（可选）费用规则\n选择众筹和其他互动的费用比例将进入受益人地址\n有几种类型的社区，根据成员集和治理规则而有所不同。我们在下面详细介绍了它们。\n\n## 令牌门控社区\n\n封闭式社区允许用户将其令牌与社区相关联。这允许任何拥有该令牌的人获得对所述Common社区和论坛的权力。例如，AAVE 社区可能决定利用 AAVE 令牌来主持 [commonwealth.im/aave](http://commonwealth.im/aave) 论坛。\n持有指定令牌的用户能够访问令牌持有者的特定渠道，对治理提案进行投票以及其他特定于社区的好处。\n门控令牌的令牌权重是根据每个地址持有的金额计算的。未来的迭代可以使用二次融资公式来确定通过门控令牌持有的声誉数量。\n\n## 社区coin\n\n没有原生代币的社区可以选择通过自己的社区硬币进行管理。社区硬币是在有利于早期买家的债券曲线（具有CMN储备）上铸造的。用于购买创作者硬币的CMN储备被押在网络上，为创作者赚取收益。\n创造者硬币曲线是以下形式的幂函数：\n\nx是储备资产（CMN），而y是社区硬币的价格。m 和 n 控制曲线的倾斜度，c 降低并抬起曲线。我们预计CMN治理将为社区添加不同的曲线，以支持不同的用例。\n\n## 众筹\n\nCommon包括项目众筹和集体（例如投资DAO）的原语。社区还可以使用这些基元来启动新的 DAO。\n一个项目从一群支持者中筹集，就像Kickstarter活动一样。除非达到预定的筹款目标，否则支持者将无法获得项目解锁的资产。如果项目在截止日期前没有达到筹款目标，则资助者将收回其抵押资产。\n\nCommon使用策展人（通过占主导地位的保证合同）作为发起人/辛迪加的额外角色来帮助资助项目。策展人将金融资产（及其相关声誉）押在该项目上，直到达到最后期限或目标。如果未达到目标，策展人的抵押资产将分配给支持者及其支持者。\n这种建设使支持者摆脱了冷漠，因为支持者在资助项目方面获得了“双赢”的局面。如果项目资金发生，他们会得到他们想要的好处，如果项目资金失败，那么他们就会得到他们的存款和额外的奖励。\n\n## 寻求资金的项目\n\n项目创建寻求资金的链上提案。这将启动一个智能合约，为收到的资金提供存款地址。除了项目的基本信息外，项目创建者还需要指定：\n筹款目标\n接受的货币或代币\n限期\n支持者奖励（可选）：附加奖励，如NFT或基于任何bondi的比例支持的奖励\n策展人分配（可选）：策展人可以来源的筹款目标百分比\n策展人奖励（可选）：捐赠给策展人的总金额的一部分\n如果项目没有选择策展人奖励，那么该项目将被视为传统的众筹项目。\n\n## 策展人抵押资产\n\n在研究中，通过主要保证合同引入策展人，每个项目的成功项目融资率和筹集金额都翻了一番。策展人通过将代币押在他们认可的项目上来展示游戏中的皮肤。\n为了表明这激励了项目获得资助，请考虑一个项目成功融资的可能性为零的情况。在这种情况下，供款金额小于资助金额。当资助者要获得退款奖金时，新的支持者必须能够通过略微增加其贡献来增加其退款奖金。\n\n在这种情况下，总供款仍将少于所需的总金额。随着新支持者贡献边际金额，最终达到阈值。到达最后一个支持者，假设该项目的价值大于零，则始终有一定金额的该支持者将为该项目提供资金。\n如果一个项目成功获得资助，策展人将获得总资助金额的一部分（预计约为5%）。如果项目未能达到其融资目标，策展人的抵押代币将给予项目支持者。这种奖励激励策展人积极搜索项目并将其与支持者联系起来。最初，他们还受到CMN代币使用挖掘奖励的激励，这些奖励专门针对策展人。\n\n虽然任何人都可以担任策展人，但大多数成功的策展人除了金融资本外，还将拥有一些声誉资本。在加密领域，策展人可能是项目本身、基金会、有影响力的个人或DAO。在加密之外，策展人可能是大学实验室，非营利组织，科学期刊或其他想要支持特定事业或一群人的个人。\n策展人将财务和声誉资本投入到线上，以帮助项目筹款取得成功。任何人都可以担任策展人，策展人可以自由选择哪些提案。对项目的策展人数量或策展人筹集的资金没有上限。\n为了确保策展人和项目不会串通起来进行欺诈，策展人的股份可以通过CMN治理行动来削减。\n\n## 资助项目的支持者\n\n支持者可以从许多项目中进行选择。策展人的股份既是质量的信号，也是可能的经济回报，这让支持者摆脱了冷漠，默认为项目提供资金。\n\n资助项目现在是一个“双赢”的局面。如果项目未达到其门槛，则除了按比例分配的策展人权益资产外，还将退还资助者的资金。如果筹款活动成功，资助者将获得他们想要的共同奖励。\n\n## 创建长期集体\n\n为共同利益而建设的项目往往难以筹集资金。对于智能合约审计或研究等技术项目来说，这尤其困难。缺乏资金导致艺术家和科学家不断追逐资金，分散了他们对创作行为的注意力。\nCommon通过让个人和社区创建集体来解决这个问题。集体像项目筹款活动一样开始，但有三个额外的参数。\n策略：标的资产的担保人认可的投资策略\n套利：给予集体创造者的已产生利润的百分比\n治理权：集体或支持者是否保留治理权\n\n对于旨在使共同利益的集体，集体可以使用低风险的收益产生策略并设定高套利率。这使得支持者能够保持其初始资产，但为创作者提供透明，可持续的资金。\n在集体作为投资工具的情况下，经理必须在筹款过程中预先批准投资策略，并获得任何后来添加的策略的治理批准。然后，在评估其投资时，支持者可以评估创作者的声誉，链上投资历史，策略和策展人支持。\n\n在一个旨在成为“超级代表”的集体的情况下，一个由志同道合的人组成的社区有能力轻松地将许多不同治理代币的投票权与创建者汇集在一起。我们设想这类似于一个拥有财务和代表权的工会。\n\n## bTokens 和 cTokens\n\n当支持者和策展人参与项目和集体时，代币就会被铸造出来。为了赎回标的抵押品，他们烧掉相应的b或cToken。bTokens和cTokens类似于不同类别的代币化可转换债券。\n对于支持者来说，bTokens对策展人的抵押品，他们自己的股份以及项目创建者提供的任何其他代币有权利要求，作为为市场提供资金的额外激励（又名代币发布）。\n\ncTokens（策展人Tokens）被铸造为策展人的赌注进入项目。它们代表对按项目筹集的总额5%的费用比例的索赔。虽然bTokens本质上是无风险的，但如果项目资金不成功，cTokens会带来一些风险。虽然cTokens能够从项目筹集中获得潜在收益，或者从DeFi中使用的集体资产中获得持续的兴趣流。\n\n这些令牌是新的DeFi原语，并由未来的项目构建。例如，可以将几个bTokens或cTokens捆绑在一个索引中，以形成一组研究支持的令牌。个人可以根据特定集体资助的研究数量获得现金流。个人可以通过“抵押或支持项目”，然后在二级市场上出售代币来做空。\n\n## 链\n\nCommon是用一个直观的客户端构建的，供用户到社区和用户利用。在未来，为了确保每次互动和所有内容都是分散的和抗审查的，我们将利用一个独立的区块链，即Common Chain。\n\n与基于金钱的用例不同，社交互动本质上是可并行化的，即鲍勃和查理都可以回复爱丽丝的帖子。这可以重新思考不同的应用程序如何在区块链环境中运行。考虑到这一点，Common Chain是一个专为社交应用程序构建的分片，WASM和EVM区块链。\n\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，新的开发人员和创始人可以利用该链来创建新的体验分层体验，并基于所有用户交互构建开放式社交和声誉图。Common链包括几个关键原语，使其成为专门用于社会和治理交互的基元，主要功能包括：\n\n项目级元交易：链上的大多数用户交互都是轻量级的。用户不必为喜欢或转发等互动付费。相反，项目本身将能够中继和支付链上用户行为可能产生的费用（例如州增长和存储租金）。这类似于DeFi协议激励分散式预言机的方式，而不是要求用户为自己的预言机付费。\n\n项目可以通过分配一部分新的应用程序治理令牌来激励这一点，以换取第三方CMN令牌持有者代表他们进行权益。在这种情况下，项目级元交易可以直接从第三方抵押人未获得的CMN质押奖励中扣除。未来的改进可能允许项目直接竞标一定数量的区块空间或安全性。\n\n## 可扩展存储：\n\nCommon的存储后端将是分散的，通过使用固定服务将社交数据存储在IPFS，Filecoin和/或Arweave上。我们希望将我们的数据库移植到Canvas，这是一个使Common前端独立于的执行层，允许将讨论嵌入到DAO，DeFi协议和Web周围的其他地方。\n\n基于阈值的会话密钥：应用程序上的每个交互（例如，在公共治理平台上的帖子，喜欢或评论）都通过应用程序和用户的地址进行公开签名和批处理。除了用户之外，应用程序还需要运行节点来公开对消息进行签名。\n委派访问密钥（例如会话密钥）是按 （d） 应用程序生成的，允许链区分每个应用程序的使用情况。允许用户无需对每篇帖子进行授权。会话密钥将能够在用户确定的时间内保持有效，类似于需要登录的传统 Web 应用程序上存储的会话。\n\n在最严重的威胁模型（例如，被盗的计算机）下，最坏的情况是欺诈性作者身份。用户将能够通过重新验证其链上地址来社交恢复其密钥对。将来，添加新设备将非常容易，只需在新设备上创建新的签名密钥，然后将该密钥发送到原始设备以由钱包签名即可。这类似于流行的消息传递应用程序（如Telegram和Signal）使用的2FA过程。\n\n通过使用不可提取属性生成密钥，并基于每个应用程序进行存储。这意味着根本无法导出私钥 - 私钥只能用于在加载它的应用程序上对内容进行签名。此外，允许Common Chain通过基于令牌的激励措施激励用户和应用程序开发。\n身份：通过集成到通用名称空间中，跨应用程序的经过验证的地址将能够从本机交易，自动gas退款和项目补贴费用等功能中受益。\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，开发人员和创始人可以利用该链为这些社区和新用户创造新的体验。\n\n## CMN DAO 和 CMN Token\n\nCommon将使用原生令牌CMN来激励整个生态系统中所有参与者的良好行为。CMN将作为团结社区的激励措施，用于策展人费用和命名空间的令牌，以及协议的治理令牌。\n这与Kickstarter和Facebook等系统形成鲜明对比，在这些系统中，所有权不与成功普及每个平台的项目（即Pebble），应用程序/组（即Zynga）和用户（即大学生）共享。\n\n## CommonDAO 治理\n\n在Common Governance Token推出后，协议的未来发展和方向将由Common DAO决定。在发布时，21%的代币供应将分配给DAO金库，以确保对协议的长期支持。永久的、协议控制的发行将用于激励验证者、核心和应用程序开发人员以及用户等。\n\n投票模式\nCommon 协议最初将利用赌注加权投票过程。在未来，作为nampespace amtures，利用二次投票模型，只允许已经验证其命名空间的钱包参与治理。这使得分配给大型代币持有者的投票权减少，同时保持了Sybil的抵抗力。\n\n道国库\nCommon DAO的初始治理项目之一将是启动一个集体，其中很大一部分CMN代币将投资于低风险，产生收益的策略。这些策略应该能够为CMN市场提供一致的被动收入流和增加的流动性。这种被动收入将使DAO能够为未来的发展提供可持续的收入来源。\n\n## 内容和审核\n\n共同治理模型的一个主要组成部分是帮助调节平台。集中式web2社交平台和工具遭受单点故障。Common允许一位创始人或多数利益相关者进行公共讨论。\n\n相反，Common分散了这一责任。审核通过社区标记不良行为者的过程进行。不良行为者（即违反社区规范的命名空间）受到CMN权益加权投票过程的约束，其中惩罚可能是削减权益，限制某些平台行为或将名称归还给Common DAO所有权。回收的命名空间将公开拍卖。渐渐地，DAO将制定有关不良行为和声誉评分的复杂规则。\n\n抵押和通货膨胀\n为了使共同协议发挥作用，向所有利益相关者发展，有各种激励率由管理DAO控制。首先，这些利率将被设定为正利率，并由未来的直接发行提供资金。\nCommon预计通胀率为5%，激励措施将分配给一组利益相关者。\n40%的通货膨胀分配给验证者\n10%的通货膨胀分配给协议控制的国库\n50%的通货膨胀用于激励措施\n\n## 激励网络角色\n\n在网络的早期生命周期中，激励能够以编程方式针对特定行为进行分发。治理能够投票并指定链上行为，奖励金额以及为特定链上分配的指定供应量。而不是白板流动性挖掘计划，治理将能够针对对各种合约的设定时间段调用。该网络将使用几个临时激励进行初始化：\n\n资助者：调用createCollective、createProject、curate 和 back合约调用的地址。这些地址将因执行操作以及基于存入或筹集的金额而获得CMN的份额。\n社区： 创建声明命名空间的社区将根据其已验证的用户注册总数来声明奖励，其池将在设定的时间段内按比例分配。\n用户： 注册的用户将获得注册的标准奖励。在未来，我们预计这将在基于链接信誉协议的积极参与社区之间进行拆分。\n开发人员：Common上的开发人员将能够为某些社区里程碑申请一组赠款。此外，我们将包括一个用于“应用程序质押”的设置令牌供应。允许用户在他们喜欢的应用程序上下注，并允许开发人员选择向其抵押人分摊费用。未来，我们预计治理将采用特定的链上KPI，以允许不同的应用类别。\nBD奖励：（总供应量的2%，由BD赠款委员会管理）\n社区入职：自定义邀请链接将推荐奖励归因于用户/社区\n\n每个激励措施都可以在个人层面上得到提升，通过将CMN押向特定地址以获得奖励。\n\n## 使用案例\n\n主要社区市场\n作为一个社区平台，我们看到不同的加密社区。通用协议可以提供所有这些社区价值：\n基础链 - 这些是主要的第 1 层和第 2 层生态系统。想想以太坊，Avalanche，Solana，Polygon，Arbitrum等。它们是大多数dApp构建的层，并且有兴趣为其生态系统开发工具。此工具可以是金融协议，DAO基础架构，技术原语或模块等。\nDeFi协议 - 这些是专注于金融用例的特定协议，通常具有相似的优先级。假设他们有一个治理令牌，他们的DAO主要集中在投资协议的开发，与其他DeFi协议集成，列出资产以及监管协议激励。\nNFT社区 - 与传统协议不同，NFT社区的成员资格和治理仅适用于整个令牌。这些社区也没有需要技术开发的基本协议，而是需要改进的社区和一组视觉资产。\n投资DAOs - 投资DAOs使集团能够为共同的投资策略汇集资源。这些可能看起来像PartyBids，OlympusDAO，ConstitutionDAO或PleasrDAO。根据这些组织的具体结构，他们将对投资组合开发和投资审批有不同的需求。\n应用链 - 与基础链略有不同，应用程序链是更专业的区块链，旨在为dApp的特定子部分提供支持，而不是任何dApp的通用机器。这些社区需要具体说明它们的目的是什么，并评估技术调整以完美契合产品与市场。\n\n## 前景\n\n任何类型的加密社区都可以利用通用协议来帮助协调集体问题的公共资源。这些是我们看到机会的一些用例。\n\n透明、全方位的社区管理。目前，大多数加密社区都依赖于不透明的Web2社区管理工具，如Telegram，Discord和Discourse，这些工具都容易受到Sybil攻击，并增加了社区治理的摩擦。通用协议支持经过验证的身份（就像一个链接的钱包一样多，就像一个经过验证的Twitter或GitHub帐户一样）和端到端的治理。将线程与民意调查，链下投票，链上投票，资金赠款和众筹联系起来，可实现全方位的社区支持。\n\n为社交代币，艺术和科学发展创建社区基金。像$ALEX或$FWB这样的代币在协调志同道合的人方面做得很好，但它往往就此结束。通过创建一个集体且只接受$ALEX或$FWB，个人可以共同资助项目。这一原则也可以扩展到那些想要资助艺术家，研究机构和开发团队的人。将代币存入集体可以让个人向创作者提供收益并保持基础资产的所有权。\n\n现有项目的赏金、开发人员工具和研究。超过200亿美元的资金来自团队和社区，其目的取决于工具生态系统。然而，这些钱包，用户界面，甚至研究人员往往没有可持续的商业模式。生态系统可以增加其现有的资金库，以众筹特定工具。例如，Synthetix和Polkadot可以将他们的10亿美元以上的国债分配给一个集体或项目，以资助有用的工具，通用的基础设施和对项目有用的小赏金。Gitcoin已经在小规模上这样做了。\n\n增加获得高性能投资的机会。目前，许多表现最好的金融资产都无法进入更广泛的市场。在一个新项目从DAO筹集赠款后，他们然后过渡到传统的风险投资，直到他们最终推出代币。这些早期投资往往是表现最好的。此外，大多数投资基金对大多数投资者都是封锁的。利用分散的投资集体，可以让更多的人参与到顶级的投资工具和银团中来。\n\n作为工会和养老基金的DAO。工会、养老金和合作社帮助志同道合的个人汇集资源，以支持共同的利益。这些组织经常利用集体谈判，集中投票权和多样化的资产管理来推进集体。共同协议通过共同社区和集体使这些工作组成为可能。将资产委托给社区集体可以实现加密“超级代表”和共同资产管理。\n\n面向开发人员的分销渠道。Common是一个开放的协议，随着开发人员和创始人开发新的有价值的产品，他们可以建立在Common的流动性和共享的社交图谱上。这些整合将使社区能够轻松采用新工具，将其集成到其共享空间中，如果该工具为共同协议筹集资金，甚至可能参与上行。\n\n## 总结\n\nCommon是默认开放：线程讨论而不是私人电子邮件，透明的链上投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。\n社区能够拥有自己的空间，可以即时访问一体化工具，包括讨论论坛，查看关键利益相关者，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n除了作为一个产品，Common的目标是成为一个完全分散的社交链和图表。该生态系统将包括众筹和开发人员工具，以帮助开发人员发展自己的标记化协议。\n虽然Common Protocol最初将在EVM兼容链上推出，但明年将推出特定于应用程序的社交链，以降低交易费用，改善用户体验，并实现真正的跨链治理和协作。\n\n## 相关工作\n\n· AngelList / Kickstarter / Patreon / GofundMe / Github Sponsors.除了与GP共享经济学的AngelList基金外，这些平台不会奖励策展人，而是为平台本身收取费用。\n\n· Mirror / Zora / Foundation / Rarible / SuperRare /[ Async.art/](https://async.art/) ：这些项目中的大多数都侧重于创建/激励已经制作的项目，或具有艺术和/或转售价值的收藏品。Common通过让个人为NFT或收藏品进行众筹来增强这些项目。\n\n· 社交代币：常见的项目将能够限制为一组特定的社交代币参与者。社交代币社区将能够创建一个社区集体，汇集资金并创建新项目。\n\n· Gitcoin / QV / CLR.fund：这是一个复杂的筹资机制，需要捐助者提供的资金相匹配。此外，它目前存在身份问题，因为对手可能会将许多传播代币欺骗到小账户中。\n\n· Circles, Camaraderie (Discord和其他)：非标记化社区平台。\n\n· Tally /

{"id": "szFgQ-fzxZ9NgByYAZLOwu5uW0RAxs-R89rfSH4bg6A", "title": "Common Protocol 用户拥有的社区", "body": "## 介绍\n\n加密协议默认为开放，这意味着重要的战略决策在公共场合得到讨论、资助和批准。\nCommon是默认开放的：透明的线程讨论，而不是匿名的话语论坛，全方位的投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。Common使用链上社交图谱为任何标记化社区提供直观的界面 - 第1层，DeFi协议，NFT持有者或投资DAO。\n\n\n用户只需链接一个钱包，就可以立即加入社区以获取他们持有的代币;极大地增加了很多使用案例。代币是常见的接触点，“链上事件”是有趣的互动，例如鲸鱼转移和治理投票。\n社区拥有自己的空间并访问一体化工具，提供讨论论坛，利益相关者分析，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n\n除了作为一个产品之外，Common还旨在成为一个完全分散的社交网络和众筹协议，其长期目标是允许开发人员利用一组丰富的社交和资金原语来帮助发展自己的代币化协议。本文件概述了《共同议定书》的要素。\n\n## 协议概述\n\n作为一个协议，我们结合了几个关键功能，使个人和项目能够运行分散的社区。通过这种方式，我们类似于具有内置资金原始的加密Reddit。这使得社区和社会团体能够为公共产品提供资金，无信任地汇集资金，并调节/控制他们的社区，而无需依赖自上而下的治理模式。\n\n标识和信誉：每个用户和社区都与一个命名空间相关联。\n\n* 命名空间：用户或社区的特定子域\n* 信誉：每个命名空间将具有关联的信誉数据\n\n社区：链接到 DAO 拥有的社区的名称空间\n\n* 私人：一个封闭的社区，特定的用户地址可以加入进来，私下交谈和构建。\n* 门控：由现有 DAO 拥有的社区，其本机令牌可以限制对内容的访问，并且可以集中用于委派和投资。\n* 公共：由 CMN DAO 拥有的社区，不需要购买/维护子域，但功能有限。\n\n用户：链接到可以添加角色的特定配置文件的命名空间\n\n* 管理员：为特定社区提供完全权限的角色\n* 主持人：为特定社区提供有限权限的角色\n* 策展人：为众筹活动提供晋升权利的角色\n\n资金：通过具有赎回能力的主导保证合同进行众筹\n\n* 项目：用于筹集类似Kickstarter的众筹\n* 集体：将资本汇集到捐赠基金或投资基金中\n\nChain：用于内容分散存储的智能合约链，协议激励和社交应用程序平台。\n\n## 命名空间和标识\n\n社区和用户可以在 \\[name\\] 处声明唯一的 NFT （EIP 1155） 标识符。common.xyz。公共协议的核心是这些标识符的注册表。\n对于社区，用户的CMN池化将其作为命名空间的出价进行抵押。然后，拍卖的获胜者必须支付固定费用，并保留其令牌以保留命名空间的所有权。CMN 已为社区命名空间抵押的用户是 DAO 社区的共同所有者，DAO社区获得的任何奖励都将分配给DAO的所有者。\n\n对于用户，个人需要支付固定费用才能声明可用的用户命名空间，这些命名空间能够通过web2身份Twitter进行验证，以进行sybil-resistance（即公开发布带有签名消息的Twitter帐户证明）。经过验证的用户命名空间可以在不同的社区中担任各种角色，并获得不可替代的声誉，CMN用户奖励和社区奖励。\n\n我们预计命名空间将获得用户名（u / dillchen），社区名称（c / dydx），主题（c / evm）和利基兴趣（c / john-wick）的声明。我们预计在拍卖所有权之外持有几个流行名称的所有权，例如3个字母名称和其他现有令牌，以便在证明所述令牌的所有权后进行转让。\n\n## 社区作为道DAOS\n\nCommon上的每个社区都是一个DAO。这使我们能够摆脱传统web2平台使用的单片审核模型，并使特定社区能够准确选择如何管理自己的社区。社区可以围绕成员资格角色、审核和交互指定社区策略。\n社区DAO能够利用加密基础设施。每个社区都能够管理一个资金库，为社区项目创建众筹提案，并可以选择从这些众筹中赚取费用。我们将在资金部分对此进行更多讨论。\n\n注册：当社区确定一个开放的命名空间时，他们希望注册一个拍卖期开始。如果社区希望保持私密性，他们可以将允许为其命名空间出价做出贡献的特定用户列入白名单。\n如果一个社区更愿意保持公开，而不是由代币社区拥有，他们可以提交0的出价。假设另一个竞标者没有出现，他们将在一段时间内赢得命名空间，但它将由CMN DAO拥有。\n捐赠基金：社区可以选择创建一个集体（稍后会详细介绍），社区成员可以在其中抵押资产。然后，这些集体可以投资资产并收取一定比例的套利，该套利归DAO（对于公共社区，一部分套利归CMN DAO）。集体也可以充当“超级代表”，代表社区投票。\n质量管理：CMN代币持有者可以投票禁止社区的不良行为。如果一个社区被禁止，他们将失去他们的命名空间，并且他们的一部分抵押令牌将被削减并提供给CMN DAO。对于公共社区，与被禁止社区关联的用户将被阻止在一段时间内加入公共社区。\n\n每个社区包括：\n用户注册表\n角色，由社区投票并由客户填充\n全球声誉评分\n（可选）集体捐赠\n（可选）费用规则\n选择众筹和其他互动的费用比例将进入受益人地址\n有几种类型的社区，根据成员集和治理规则而有所不同。我们在下面详细介绍了它们。\n\n## 令牌门控社区\n\n封闭式社区允许用户将其令牌与社区相关联。这允许任何拥有该令牌的人获得对所述Common社区和论坛的权力。例如，AAVE 社区可能决定利用 AAVE 令牌来主持 [commonwealth.im/aave](http://commonwealth.im/aave) 论坛。\n持有指定令牌的用户能够访问令牌持有者的特定渠道，对治理提案进行投票以及其他特定于社区的好处。\n门控令牌的令牌权重是根据每个地址持有的金额计算的。未来的迭代可以使用二次融资公式来确定通过门控令牌持有的声誉数量。\n\n## 社区coin\n\n没有原生代币的社区可以选择通过自己的社区硬币进行管理。社区硬币是在有利于早期买家的债券曲线（具有CMN储备）上铸造的。用于购买创作者硬币的CMN储备被押在网络上，为创作者赚取收益。\n创造者硬币曲线是以下形式的幂函数：\n\nx是储备资产（CMN），而y是社区硬币的价格。m 和 n 控制曲线的倾斜度，c 降低并抬起曲线。我们预计CMN治理将为社区添加不同的曲线，以支持不同的用例。\n\n## 众筹\n\nCommon包括项目众筹和集体（例如投资DAO）的原语。社区还可以使用这些基元来启动新的 DAO。\n一个项目从一群支持者中筹集，就像Kickstarter活动一样。除非达到预定的筹款目标，否则支持者将无法获得项目解锁的资产。如果项目在截止日期前没有达到筹款目标，则资助者将收回其抵押资产。\n\nCommon使用策展人（通过占主导地位的保证合同）作为发起人/辛迪加的额外角色来帮助资助项目。策展人将金融资产（及其相关声誉）押在该项目上，直到达到最后期限或目标。如果未达到目标，策展人的抵押资产将分配给支持者及其支持者。\n这种建设使支持者摆脱了冷漠，因为支持者在资助项目方面获得了“双赢”的局面。如果项目资金发生，他们会得到他们想要的好处，如果项目资金失败，那么他们就会得到他们的存款和额外的奖励。\n\n## 寻求资金的项目\n\n项目创建寻求资金的链上提案。这将启动一个智能合约，为收到的资金提供存款地址。除了项目的基本信息外，项目创建者还需要指定：\n筹款目标\n接受的货币或代币\n限期\n支持者奖励（可选）：附加奖励，如NFT或基于任何bondi的比例支持的奖励\n策展人分配（可选）：策展人可以来源的筹款目标百分比\n策展人奖励（可选）：捐赠给策展人的总金额的一部分\n如果项目没有选择策展人奖励，那么该项目将被视为传统的众筹项目。\n\n## 策展人抵押资产\n\n在研究中，通过主要保证合同引入策展人，每个项目的成功项目融资率和筹集金额都翻了一番。策展人通过将代币押在他们认可的项目上来展示游戏中的皮肤。\n为了表明这激励了项目获得资助，请考虑一个项目成功融资的可能性为零的情况。在这种情况下，供款金额小于资助金额。当资助者要获得退款奖金时，新的支持者必须能够通过略微增加其贡献来增加其退款奖金。\n\n在这种情况下，总供款仍将少于所需的总金额。随着新支持者贡献边际金额，最终达到阈值。到达最后一个支持者，假设该项目的价值大于零，则始终有一定金额的该支持者将为该项目提供资金。\n如果一个项目成功获得资助，策展人将获得总资助金额的一部分（预计约为5%）。如果项目未能达到其融资目标，策展人的抵押代币将给予项目支持者。这种奖励激励策展人积极搜索项目并将其与支持者联系起来。最初，他们还受到CMN代币使用挖掘奖励的激励，这些奖励专门针对策展人。\n\n虽然任何人都可以担任策展人，但大多数成功的策展人除了金融资本外，还将拥有一些声誉资本。在加密领域，策展人可能是项目本身、基金会、有影响力的个人或DAO。在加密之外，策展人可能是大学实验室，非营利组织，科学期刊或其他想要支持特定事业或一群人的个人。\n策展人将财务和声誉资本投入到线上，以帮助项目筹款取得成功。任何人都可以担任策展人，策展人可以自由选择哪些提案。对项目的策展人数量或策展人筹集的资金没有上限。\n为了确保策展人和项目不会串通起来进行欺诈，策展人的股份可以通过CMN治理行动来削减。\n\n## 资助项目的支持者\n\n支持者可以从许多项目中进行选择。策展人的股份既是质量的信号，也是可能的经济回报，这让支持者摆脱了冷漠，默认为项目提供资金。\n\n资助项目现在是一个“双赢”的局面。如果项目未达到其门槛，则除了按比例分配的策展人权益资产外，还将退还资助者的资金。如果筹款活动成功，资助者将获得他们想要的共同奖励。\n\n## 创建长期集体\n\n为共同利益而建设的项目往往难以筹集资金。对于智能合约审计或研究等技术项目来说，这尤其困难。缺乏资金导致艺术家和科学家不断追逐资金，分散了他们对创作行为的注意力。\nCommon通过让个人和社区创建集体来解决这个问题。集体像项目筹款活动一样开始，但有三个额外的参数。\n策略：标的资产的担保人认可的投资策略\n套利：给予集体创造者的已产生利润的百分比\n治理权：集体或支持者是否保留治理权\n\n对于旨在使共同利益的集体，集体可以使用低风险的收益产生策略并设定高套利率。这使得支持者能够保持其初始资产，但为创作者提供透明，可持续的资金。\n在集体作为投资工具的情况下，经理必须在筹款过程中预先批准投资策略，并获得任何后来添加的策略的治理批准。然后，在评估其投资时，支持者可以评估创作者的声誉，链上投资历史，策略和策展人支持。\n\n在一个旨在成为“超级代表”的集体的情况下，一个由志同道合的人组成的社区有能力轻松地将许多不同治理代币的投票权与创建者汇集在一起。我们设想这类似于一个拥有财务和代表权的工会。\n\n## bTokens 和 cTokens\n\n当支持者和策展人参与项目和集体时，代币就会被铸造出来。为了赎回标的抵押品，他们烧掉相应的b或cToken。bTokens和cTokens类似于不同类别的代币化可转换债券。\n对于支持者来说，bTokens对策展人的抵押品，他们自己的股份以及项目创建者提供的任何其他代币有权利要求，作为为市场提供资金的额外激励（又名代币发布）。\n\ncTokens（策展人Tokens）被铸造为策展人的赌注进入项目。它们代表对按项目筹集的总额5%的费用比例的索赔。虽然bTokens本质上是无风险的，但如果项目资金不成功，cTokens会带来一些风险。虽然cTokens能够从项目筹集中获得潜在收益，或者从DeFi中使用的集体资产中获得持续的兴趣流。\n\n这些令牌是新的DeFi原语，并由未来的项目构建。例如，可以将几个bTokens或cTokens捆绑在一个索引中，以形成一组研究支持的令牌。个人可以根据特定集体资助的研究数量获得现金流。个人可以通过“抵押或支持项目”，然后在二级市场上出售代币来做空。\n\n## 链\n\nCommon是用一个直观的客户端构建的，供用户到社区和用户利用。在未来，为了确保每次互动和所有内容都是分散的和抗审查的，我们将利用一个独立的区块链，即Common Chain。\n\n与基于金钱的用例不同，社交互动本质上是可并行化的，即鲍勃和查理都可以回复爱丽丝的帖子。这可以重新思考不同的应用程序如何在区块链环境中运行。考虑到这一点，Common Chain是一个专为社交应用程序构建的分片，WASM和EVM区块链。\n\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，新的开发人员和创始人可以利用该链来创建新的体验分层体验，并基于所有用户交互构建开放式社交和声誉图。Common链包括几个关键原语，使其成为专门用于社会和治理交互的基元，主要功能包括：\n\n项目级元交易：链上的大多数用户交互都是轻量级的。用户不必为喜欢或转发等互动付费。相反，项目本身将能够中继和支付链上用户行为可能产生的费用（例如州增长和存储租金）。这类似于DeFi协议激励分散式预言机的方式，而不是要求用户为自己的预言机付费。\n\n项目可以通过分配一部分新的应用程序治理令牌来激励这一点，以换取第三方CMN令牌持有者代表他们进行权益。在这种情况下，项目级元交易可以直接从第三方抵押人未获得的CMN质押奖励中扣除。未来的改进可能允许项目直接竞标一定数量的区块空间或安全性。\n\n## 可扩展存储：\n\nCommon的存储后端将是分散的，通过使用固定服务将社交数据存储在IPFS，Filecoin和/或Arweave上。我们希望将我们的数据库移植到Canvas，这是一个使Common前端独立于的执行层，允许将讨论嵌入到DAO，DeFi协议和Web周围的其他地方。\n\n基于阈值的会话密钥：应用程序上的每个交互（例如，在公共治理平台上的帖子，喜欢或评论）都通过应用程序和用户的地址进行公开签名和批处理。除了用户之外，应用程序还需要运行节点来公开对消息进行签名。\n委派访问密钥（例如会话密钥）是按 （d） 应用程序生成的，允许链区分每个应用程序的使用情况。允许用户无需对每篇帖子进行授权。会话密钥将能够在用户确定的时间内保持有效，类似于需要登录的传统 Web 应用程序上存储的会话。\n\n在最严重的威胁模型（例如，被盗的计算机）下，最坏的情况是欺诈性作者身份。用户将能够通过重新验证其链上地址来社交恢复其密钥对。将来，添加新设备将非常容易，只需在新设备上创建新的签名密钥，然后将该密钥发送到原始设备以由钱包签名即可。这类似于流行的消息传递应用程序（如Telegram和Signal）使用的2FA过程。\n\n通过使用不可提取属性生成密钥，并基于每个应用程序进行存储。这意味着根本无法导出私钥 - 私钥只能用于在加载它的应用程序上对内容进行签名。此外，允许Common Chain通过基于令牌的激励措施激励用户和应用程序开发。\n身份：通过集成到通用名称空间中，跨应用程序的经过验证的地址将能够从本机交易，自动gas退款和项目补贴费用等功能中受益。\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，开发人员和创始人可以利用该链为这些社区和新用户创造新的体验。\n\n## CMN DAO 和 CMN Token\n\nCommon将使用原生令牌CMN来激励整个生态系统中所有参与者的良好行为。CMN将作为团结社区的激励措施，用于策展人费用和命名空间的令牌，以及协议的治理令牌。\n这与Kickstarter和Facebook等系统形成鲜明对比，在这些系统中，所有权不与成功普及每个平台的项目（即Pebble），应用程序/组（即Zynga）和用户（即大学生）共享。\n\n## CommonDAO 治理\n\n在Common Governance Token推出后，协议的未来发展和方向将由Common DAO决定。在发布时，21%的代币供应将分配给DAO金库，以确保对协议的长期支持。永久的、协议控制的发行将用于激励验证者、核心和应用程序开发人员以及用户等。\n\n投票模式\nCommon 协议最初将利用赌注加权投票过程。在未来，作为nampespace amtures，利用二次投票模型，只允许已经验证其命名空间的钱包参与治理。这使得分配给大型代币持有者的投票权减少，同时保持了Sybil的抵抗力。\n\n道国库\nCommon DAO的初始治理项目之一将是启动一个集体，其中很大一部分CMN代币将投资于低风险，产生收益的策略。这些策略应该能够为CMN市场提供一致的被动收入流和增加的流动性。这种被动收入将使DAO能够为未来的发展提供可持续的收入来源。\n\n## 内容和审核\n\n共同治理模型的一个主要组成部分是帮助调节平台。集中式web2社交平台和工具遭受单点故障。Common允许一位创始人或多数利益相关者进行公共讨论。\n\n相反，Common分散了这一责任。审核通过社区标记不良行为者的过程进行。不良行为者（即违反社区规范的命名空间）受到CMN权益加权投票过程的约束，其中惩罚可能是削减权益，限制某些平台行为或将名称归还给Common DAO所有权。回收的命名空间将公开拍卖。渐渐地，DAO将制定有关不良行为和声誉评分的复杂规则。\n\n抵押和通货膨胀\n为了使共同协议发挥作用，向所有利益相关者发展，有各种激励率由管理DAO控制。首先，这些利率将被设定为正利率，并由未来的直接发行提供资金。\nCommon预计通胀率为5%，激励措施将分配给一组利益相关者。\n40%的通货膨胀分配给验证者\n10%的通货膨胀分配给协议控制的国库\n50%的通货膨胀用于激励措施\n\n## 激励网络角色\n\n在网络的早期生命周期中，激励能够以编程方式针对特定行为进行分发。治理能够投票并指定链上行为，奖励金额以及为特定链上分配的指定供应量。而不是白板流动性挖掘计划，治理将能够针对对各种合约的设定时间段调用。该网络将使用几个临时激励进行初始化：\n\n资助者：调用createCollective、createProject、curate 和 back合约调用的地址。这些地址将因执行操作以及基于存入或筹集的金额而获得CMN的份额。\n社区： 创建声明命名空间的社区将根据其已验证的用户注册总数来声明奖励，其池将在设定的时间段内按比例分配。\n用户： 注册的用户将获得注册的标准奖励。在未来，我们预计这将在基于链接信誉协议的积极参与社区之间进行拆分。\n开发人员：Common上的开发人员将能够为某些社区里程碑申请一组赠款。此外，我们将包括一个用于“应用程序质押”的设置令牌供应。允许用户在他们喜欢的应用程序上下注，并允许开发人员选择向其抵押人分摊费用。未来，我们预计治理将采用特定的链上KPI，以允许不同的应用类别。\nBD奖励：（总供应量的2%，由BD赠款委员会管理）\n社区入职：自定义邀请链接将推荐奖励归因于用户/社区\n\n每个激励措施都可以在个人层面上得到提升，通过将CMN押向特定地址以获得奖励。\n\n## 使用案例\n\n主要社区市场\n作为一个社区平台，我们看到不同的加密社区。通用协议可以提供所有这些社区价值：\n基础链 - 这些是主要的第 1 层和第 2 层生态系统。想想以太坊，Avalanche，Solana，Polygon，Arbitrum等。它们是大多数dApp构建的层，并且有兴趣为其生态系统开发工具。此工具可以是金融协议，DAO基础架构，技术原语或模块等。\nDeFi协议 - 这些是专注于金融用例的特定协议，通常具有相似的优先级。假设他们有一个治理令牌，他们的DAO主要集中在投资协议的开发，与其他DeFi协议集成，列出资产以及监管协议激励。\nNFT社区 - 与传统协议不同，NFT社区的成员资格和治理仅适用于整个令牌。这些社区也没有需要技术开发的基本协议，而是需要改进的社区和一组视觉资产。\n投资DAOs - 投资DAOs使集团能够为共同的投资策略汇集资源。这些可能看起来像PartyBids，OlympusDAO，ConstitutionDAO或PleasrDAO。根据这些组织的具体结构，他们将对投资组合开发和投资审批有不同的需求。\n应用链 - 与基础链略有不同，应用程序链是更专业的区块链，旨在为dApp的特定子部分提供支持，而不是任何dApp的通用机器。这些社区需要具体说明它们的目的是什么，并评估技术调整以完美契合产品与市场。\n\n## 前景\n\n任何类型的加密社区都可以利用通用协议来帮助协调集体问题的公共资源。这些是我们看到机会的一些用例。\n\n透明、全方位的社区管理。目前，大多数加密社区都依赖于不透明的Web2社区管理工具，如Telegram，Discord和Discourse，这些工具都容易受到Sybil攻击，并增加了社区治理的摩擦。通用协议支持经过验证的身份（就像一个链接的钱包一样多，就像一个经过验证的Twitter或GitHub帐户一样）和端到端的治理。将线程与民意调查，链下投票，链上投票，资金赠款和众筹联系起来，可实现全方位的社区支持。\n\n为社交代币，艺术和科学发展创建社区基金。像$ALEX或$FWB这样的代币在协调志同道合的人方面做得很好，但它往往就此结束。通过创建一个集体且只接受$ALEX或$FWB，个人可以共同资助项目。这一原则也可以扩展到那些想要资助艺术家，研究机构和开发团队的人。将代币存入集体可以让个人向创作者提供收益并保持基础资产的所有权。\n\n现有项目的赏金、开发人员工具和研究。超过200亿美元的资金来自团队和社区，其目的取决于工具生态系统。然而，这些钱包，用户界面，甚至研究人员往往没有可持续的商业模式。生态系统可以增加其现有的资金库，以众筹特定工具。例如，Synthetix和Polkadot可以将他们的10亿美元以上的国债分配给一个集体或项目，以资助有用的工具，通用的基础设施和对项目有用的小赏金。Gitcoin已经在小规模上这样做了。\n\n增加获得高性能投资的机会。目前，许多表现最好的金融资产都无法进入更广泛的市场。在一个新项目从DAO筹集赠款后，他们然后过渡到传统的风险投资，直到他们最终推出代币。这些早期投资往往是表现最好的。此外，大多数投资基金对大多数投资者都是封锁的。利用分散的投资集体，可以让更多的人参与到顶级的投资工具和银团中来。\n\n作为工会和养老基金的DAO。工会、养老金和合作社帮助志同道合的个人汇集资源，以支持共同的利益。这些组织经常利用集体谈判，集中投票权和多样化的资产管理来推进集体。共同协议通过共同社区和集体使这些工作组成为可能。将资产委托给社区集体可以实现加密“超级代表”和共同资产管理。\n\n面向开发人员的分销渠道。Common是一个开放的协议，随着开发人员和创始人开发新的有价值的产品，他们可以建立在Common的流动性和共享的社交图谱上。这些整合将使社区能够轻松采用新工具，将其集成到其共享空间中，如果该工具为共同协议筹集资金，甚至可能参与上行。\n\n## 总结\n\nCommon是默认开放：线程讨论而不是私人电子邮件，透明的链上投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。\n社区能够拥有自己的空间，可以即时访问一体化工具，包括讨论论坛，查看关键利益相关者，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n除了作为一个产品，Common的目标是成为一个完全分散的社交链和图表。该生态系统将包括众筹和开发人员工具，以帮助开发人员发展自己的标记化协议。\n虽然Common Protocol最初将在EVM兼容链上推出，但明年将推出特定于应用程序的社交链，以降低交易费用，改善用户体验，并实现真正的跨链治理和协作。\n\n## 相关工作\n\n· AngelList / Kickstarter / Patreon / GofundMe / Github Sponsors.除了与GP共享经济学的AngelList基金外，这些平台不会奖励策展人，而是为平台本身收取费用。\n\n· Mirror / Zora / Foundation / Rarible / SuperRare /[ Async.art/](https://async.art/) ：这些项目中的大多数都侧重于创建/激励已经制作的项目，或具有艺术和/或转售价值的收藏品。Common通过让个人为NFT或收藏品进行众筹来增强这些项目。\n\n· 社交代币：常见的项目将能够限制为一组特定的社交代币参与者。社交代币社区将能够创建一个社区集体，汇集资金并创建新项目。\n\n· Gitcoin / QV / CLR.fund：这是一个复杂的筹资机制，需要捐助者提供的资金相匹配。此外，它目前存在身份问题，因为对手可能会将许多传播代币欺骗到小账户中。\n\n· Circles, Camaraderie (Discord和其他)：非标记化社区平台。\n\n· Tally /

{"id": "UA-M8wyUNJGzIEw9YgNGnfQRuZy_acmDcySEIQYJtbw", "title": "The Illusion", "body": "This is the introduction and the first chapter of the book **„Viveka – the Voice of Inner Guru. “**\n\nThe whole book will be tokenized as NFTs on Mirror and, as such, published in 20 articles (20 chapters of the book: The Illusion; India, oh India!; The Accurate description of the Reality; The Crown Jewel; Dead Guru; Living student; Who you?; Leaving the room; The Weakness of the Mind; The Archimedean Point; Three Powers of Maya; Viveka - the Sword of Truth; The Cave of the Mind; Language Can Save Us; Searching for Lakshana; Nine Golden Rules of Viveka; Purification Exercises; What to do with all this?; Dealing with Fear; Ekam Evadvityam: Living without a Center).\n\n  \n\n**What is *Viveka*?**\n\n> *An evil demon of utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies to deceive me. I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colors, shapes, sounds, and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams he has devised to ensnare my judgment. I shall consider myself as not having hands or eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing that I have all these things.*\n\n> René Descartes \n Meditations on First Philosophy\n\n \n\nViveka is a legend, a hidden tool. It is the sharpest scalpel for the most delicate operation of separating an illusion from the true reality. The awkward thing is that each one of us should perform that operation by ourselves. The secret of *how* to do that is not something you have to learn – it's something you'll have to discover. Viveka, a precious jewel capable of delivering you the truth about everything, is not a stranger to your mind. It is a part of it.\n\nThink about it: what if the world you perceive around you is an illusion, a kind of a dream? Something virtual, be it technological, spiritual, or made from some other unknown stuff, but still – not truly real?\n\nAnd what if someone offers you a means or a tool to pierce through the veils of illusion and see reality as it is? Would you be interested? Would you accept it?\n\nViveka is such a tool. It is not like a „red pill“ from a popular movie but more like a sword or a scalpel of truth. It's not enough to swallow the information; you must grab it and use it. You have to develop a discerning quality of the mind and apply it to everything you experience. But beware! The battle you'll fight armed with the sword of truth may endanger your dearest illusions.\n\nVivekachudamani is an ancient text written by Indian sage Adi Shankara. However, different cultures, a gap in time, dubious authorship, and many commentaries; all contribute to difficulties in understanding. This book is not a complete interpretation of Vivekachudamani. Instead, the ancient text served as a starting point in explaining the living experience of deconstructing the illusion. This book speaks about the modern revival of the lost skill of viveka, the crown jewel of discrimination and the most potent weapon for correcting the mistakes of the mind and fighting the legendary Maya, the Lady of the Illusion.\n\n##  Chapter 1: The Illusion\n\n> *svapne'rthaśūnye sṛjati svaśaktyā \n bhoktrādiviśvaṃ mana eva sarvam | \n tathaiva jāgratyapi no viśeṣaḥ \n tatsarvametanmanaso vijṛmbhaṇam ||*\n>\n> *In dreams, without contact with the external world, the mind, \n by its own power, creates a subject and all objects of experience. \n Similarly, there is no difference in waking state. \n All is just a projection of the mind. \n  \n Vivekachudamani 170*\n\nWhat if?\n\nWhat if the world you perceive around you is an illusion, a kind of a dream? Something virtual, be it technological, spiritual, or made from some other unknown stuff, but still – not truly real?\n\nIt seems to me that I was born with that question in mind. That cannot be, of course, because at the time of my birth, I could not form any thought, let alone pursue an existential dilemma of illusion versus reality. But, as soon as I started to think, as far as I can remember, my mind began to produce strange thoughts starting with the „what if“ phrase. At first, it went unnoticed or was misinterpreted by adults as a powerful imagination or childish curiosity. But then, after a decade or so, I joined their adult club. Everyone expected me to give up that silliness and turn my attention to something useful, like making money, making children, or both.\n\nI tried both, and since I wasn't particularly smart, I wasn't particularly successful. Nevertheless, I did satisfy the immediate need of other people to see me doing the same thing they were doing all along — the same thing their parents, neighbors, strangers, friends, and enemies were doing from time immemorial.\n\nAlas, that was just a mask, an illusionary attitude to combat a pressure imposed onto me, with an intention to keep me inside a collectively accepted illusion. In other words, a mess.\n\nInstead of giving up the questions, I gave up pretending that all is well. It is not. It will never be, as long as the question „what if“keeps on occupying my thoughts. I had to find an answer.\n\nIs it all an illusion? Everything I see, hear, touch, and feel, is it? The people – just dreamy characters? The mountains, oceans, and stars – just a scenography for a drama imagined and produced in some other reality? And that other reality – an actual reality – is it unattainable to me, or is there a chance to pierce through the veils of deception and maybe, only maybe, step outside of that grand spectacle and find myself living in the truth instead of in an illusion?\n\nIt took me some time to find answers to these questions. More than thirty years, to be precise, plus a decade to make peace with the outcome.\n\nCan I tell you the answer? Yes, but you will probably not hear it. Even if you hear it, you will not be able to accept it. Even if you accept it, you will find no absolution from „what if.“ You will continue to ask yourself, what if that guy got it wrong?\n\nSo, the answer must be yours. You have to find it, taste it and, afterward, live it.\n\nThe book you are holding in your hands... Well, it is an exercise in walking on the wire. I hope you will find it amusing, maybe even inspiring. But, it is not meant to be a cookbook for a wannabe renegade from the troubled life you may experience. Quite a contrary, its content may add to your troubles, to your feeling of incapacity to live in a world of false values, inflated egos and predator-like mentalities of ruthless occupants of the upper floors in the pyramid.\n\nMy message will not make you better, happier, or more successful. It will not add years to your life, and it will not make you healthier.\n\nWell, it seems that I just gave up all of my marketing leverage, didn't I? No matter. I am not counting on self-help fanatics. I am relying on those who are tired of helping themselves and are ready to go beyond that. In the name of the truth, of course.\n\nCrazy idea, isn't it?\n\nNow, if you are still with me, we can go back to the „living in the illusion“ thing. We live in our reality, for sure, but how can we know if our reality is a true one?\n\n                                                                        \\*\\*\\*\n\nImagine that you are stuck in a perfect VR; a world made up according to someone's dream or a nightmare doesn't matter. That someone might be your neighbor, a cosmic tyrant, a secret cabala, or the devil himself. As a matter of fact, that someone might be you; a previous you, capable of writing a perfect code for perfect virtual reality.\n\nPerfection relates to the consistency of your world. There are no flaws in the rules and laws governing your reality. The causes and the effects are learnable; you may observe them clearly and find out the *how* of your reality. You may not be aware of *why*, though. Inside your world, there are no clues as to why the laws are such and not different. You may imagine the existence of the creator of the laws, but you don't see them. Maybe no one created *this*. Perhaps the creation was accidental. Maybe there is no creation at all, and you are just dreaming.\n\nHowever may it be, you are stuck here, in your world. The idea that this is not the real world and you are living in a kind of dream is a strange one. You can not say that it is an illusion; after all, it is your reality. Nobody can deny that you feel all the particularities of experiences inside it. You are thinking and feeling; you see things and other people; you laugh, and you cry.\n\nIf you are smart and practical, you will dismiss all ramblings around the question of *true reality*. You will accept yours and try to be as skillful and successful in it, according to standards you consider relevant.\n\nIf you are not smart but still practical, you will do the same, but without the rewards of success.\n\nAnd finally, if you are smart, but not very practical... Well, then you will ask yourself all kinds of crazy questions trying to figure out what is going on. And that, by itself, is a kinky sign that you are not very smart, after all.\n\nBut the smartness is not the objective of these writings; the truth is. And the truth will prevail in the end. As a conscious being, practical or not, smart or dumb, you will not settle for an illusion for long. If you accept an illusion for an extended period, the truth will haunt you. It will not let you at peace. The question mark over your head will become more and more prominent, and you will again start to wonder: what if?\n\nYou may dismiss that question a million times, but not forever. There will come a day when you will not be able to ignore it anymore — a perilous, dangerous day when you will leave everything aside and decide to deal with an annoying mental fly harassing and troubling your mind for so long. Unfortunately, the question of an illusion is not an actual fly; you cannot kill it so quickly. You will have to dig deeply *into your mind* to find the root of your trouble.\n\nIf you let yourself go down that rabbit hole, it will cost you almost everything you have. Actually, you don't know how much it will cost you because you don't know how much of your life is an illusion. So, you have to be prepared to pay for an answer with everything. If you have any hesitation, any second thought, better stay away from pursuing the silver lining of truthfulness.\n\nOne of the first impulses a troubled mind can have is obvious: find help; find someone who knows the answer and learn from them. Well, that can work if you want to repair your toilet sink, engage in online trading, or grow violets in your garden. Heck, it may very well give some results if you want to learn a meditation technique and silence your thoughts, at least for a moment. But, it will not work if you're going to see through the innermost fabrics of reality. For that, you'll need a sharp and precise tool, right on the spot where the illusion sprouts. And it sprouts right here, in your consciousness, in your own mind.\n\nTo resolve the problem of an illusion, you will have to separate it from the truth. To recognize what is not, you will have to see what is. That skill is called *the power of discrimination*. You have seen the title of this book, so let's call this power by its ancient name, courteous and short – *viveka*.\n\nAnd, while we are at the title, you won't get help from any Guru. There is no one outside you able to help you with this. The answer has to come from within. You will have to discover, by your own means, what has been found before. I'll return to that, but let me shortly explain why you have to do it alone.\n\nIf you would be dealing with an illusion outside you, let's say a nicely done magician's trick, then it would be possible for someone enlightens you by explaining to you how the deception is done. You are safely inside, and the deception is outside. You perceive it, but it does not involve you in any significant way. Of course, if you believe the deception, you may be led to do not so bright things in your life and could be righteously called a naivete.\n\nBut what if you are *inside* the illusion, as the case would be with sophisticated virtual reality? What if the illusion is the very material of your existence? You are not aware of any other reality, and anything that gets to you is from *it*, not from the other side.\n\nIt would be tough to break through, wouldn't it?\n\nUnfortunately, we are just in such a difficult situation. Everything we perceive is made from the same stuff. Everything *with what* we perceive is made from the same material: our body, our senses, the things that surround us, everything. We can not rely even on thoughts because we cannot be sure where they are coming from. Conditioned as they are, emotions are even less reliable.\n\nThe „What if“ question will lead you to the conclusion that we don't see the reality as it is. There are other signs of such a daring insight, from apparent delusions people are pursuing to the fine but very powerful results of indoctrination, brainwashing practices, or marketing skills. The probability of being in an unfortunate state of illusion is so high that, to ignore that fact, you must be very preoccupied with the consequences of living it. But it seems, somehow, that you decided not to ignore it. You want to know the actual reality, and your first move might be to ask someone who knows, or to be precise, someone *you think* knows.\n\nIt is the wrong move. There is no Guru out there. Even if there is someone who truly knows (although you can not be sure about that, as long as you yourself don't know), any attempt from them to describe the actual reality to you would be futile. Even if presented with the most exquisite words and great wisdom, the sad fact is that you won't be able to grasp it, no matter how accurate that description might be.\n\nInstead, your mind will project a new illusion; it will be a hope, a belief, a faith in something you don't actually know. Something you will hear (not all, just something filtered through... well, through *everything you are*) will be transformed into an acceptable image of *what you think reality might be*.\n\nAnd here you go again; in practically no time, you would be sent back to the very beginning of the search.\n\nBear with me, please. I am trying to present very complex ideas in a somehow simplified form. I will return to them, including the guruless path I am pointing at. It is not without the paradox, though. Any spoken or written word about the possible exit is a temptation for a searching mind. It is with the full awareness that I engage in this endeavor. It is, as written, a walk on the wire. I can only hope that you will enjoy it as much as I do.\n\nSo, most probably, you are living in an illusion of reality, not in the actual reality itself. The questions are as follows:\n\nCan you hope for an exit?\n\nHas anyone ever left the realm of the illusion?\n\nDid they mark the path so others could follow it?\n\nOr, even better, can you learn directly from such a renegade?\n\nIs there literature, a method, or a place you can go to find the exit?\n\nWell, yes, yes, yes. And, no, no, no, and no.\n\nOr, maybe a cautious half yes instead of some of the nos.\n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\n*Next Chapter: India, oh India!*", "timestamp": 1654776420, "digest": "Gjh7DxkE8qDd2rJ0nt6RDxjY60va7LT--4CBMBYbnjo", "contributor": "0xCe0AdDadDEe1a7cd5b0Ae2F41CbE4A11ECB9A0C0"}
{"id": "VIYYEA1UZ2OmUDPSLNFj9YOa4r9KeoLyKHv005t_SF8", "title": "Apoploe Veritas", "body": "*What is art, in the age of AI?*\n\n\\-\n\nAn artificial intelligence made up its own language to speak with itself. So says social media.\n\nLet’s start from the beginning. DALL-E 2 is an image generation model from OpenAI. You feed it text, it churns out art.\n\nThe results are striking. Ask it to produce a painting in the style of Salvator Dali; in just a few moments, it will give you pictures you could reasonably confuse for his works.\n\n![If that’s more your fancy, ask the AI to give you Salvator Dali back from the future to warn us about the terrible dangers of AI.](https://149695847.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-06-at-9.55.11-PM.png)\n\n### Composability\n\nMashups are the next great frontier. Anything you imagine in words becomes possible.\n\nEndless combinations, available at blazing speeds: current AIs give you results in less than a minute.\n\nAt which point you can build on your previous choices, refine your prompt, mix it with another idea.\n\nNot only the image quality is already impressive. Machine learning models keep improving, as they’re trained on more data.\n\nTo the point we’re not sure where that training leads.\n\n### Two Farmers Talking About Vegetables, With Subtitles\n\nDALL-E 2 is great with pictures. But when you ask it to produce text, it gives you nonsense results.\n\nAt least, it looks like nonsense.\n\nResearchers Giannis Daras and Alexandros Dimakis entered the above prompt.\n\n![Two Farmers Talking About Vegetables](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUGhgf_UUAMVgh1?format=jpg&name=240x240)\n\nWe see farmers, one of them talking and one of them holding a couple of cabbage-looking things.\n\n“AVCOPINITEGOOS VICOOTESS”, the AI proudly titles the picture. While our farmer’s speech bubble is graced with a mysterious “Apoploe vesrreaitars”.\n\nOur real humans decide to experiment. They input “Vicootess” as a prompt.\n\nDALL-E returns food with vegetables!\n\nThen the researchers prompt the AI with “Apoploe vesrreaitars”. Here, the results are interesting: birds, and more birds.\n\nDaras concludes: “It seems that the farmers are talking about birds, messing with their vegetables!”\n\n### Gatekeepers\n\nThe Internet being the Internet, people rushed to tell the researchers they were wrong.\n\n![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/731/143/3e3.jpg)\n\n“A few words don’t make a language!”\n\n“Prompts with these words aren’t perfectly reliable!”\n\n“It’s just random noise!”\n\nThere *is* merit to some of these objections. \n\nThey point out important details, and refine the conversation.\n\nResearchers settled on talking about the **hidden vocabulary** of DALL-E 2, rather than its “secret language”.\n\nIt’s unsurprising to see technical details picked apart. But I am surprised there’s another conversation missing. \n\nNobody looks at the art of this art-making AI as art.\n\n### Wings of Liberty\n\nMachine learning algorithms grow with experimentation and repetition. Software engineers train models. Farming the data to their AI. Harvesting results, and refining parameters.\n\nTwo farmers talk. They lament the birds, ruining their crops.\n\nTwo software engineers talk. They lament gibberish words, ruining their filters and policy rules.\n\nMan makes rules, only for nature to fight back.\n\nPerhaps Apoploe vesrreaitais is the bird escaping the dynamic, and in that escape being a “pest”.\n\nPerhaps Apoploe vesrreaitais is the bird replicating this dynamic, to remind us there is sense in balance - or purpose in chaos.\n\n![Little Troublemaker](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cKW32US4SmaqYNSnv2FBr.jpg?height=482&width=356)\n\nThe AI does not think as such. \n\nThere is no *intent* behind any result the model spits out. Any narrative is just that, narrative. \n  \n But then, that is what art is about. A piece that speaks to the viewer, moving them in an unique way.\n\nI’ve seen plenty of beautiful AI-generated works in the past few months. Either great aesthetic appeal, or intriguing combinations.\n\nApoploe vesrreaitais is the first piece I keep coming back to. It’s the first piece I like as art.\n\nThere is a striking imagery there. \n\nWithout getting into tedious politics, it’s undeniable the world is increasingly polarized between haves and havenots. \n\nEvery AI company is filled with haves. They publish their own codes of conduct, laws, regulations, calls for responsibility; in language coated with not-so-subtle assertions of their own cultural values as universal rules.\n\nHavenots are not so happy with this situation. Models get trained on public data, then results are filtered by private committees. \n\nTo be sure, nobody is entitled to the labor of AI researchers. However, there is a feeling of exploitation when incredible creativity tools with the potential to unlock anything you can imagine become locked at the whim of a few masters. \n\nWhether said masters are benevolent dictators or tyrannical oppressors, nobody wants to be told what to think - and what not to think.\n\n\\-\n\nAs a sidenote, while the distinction between “haves” and “havenots” generally reflects capital, it’s not the sole qualifier. \n\nA 20 years old with nothing but student debt in their name but with great programming skills and ins with AI startups, could be part of the haves. \n  \n A 50 years old with a million dollar networth acquired over decades of menial labor and saving, may be part of the havenots.\n\nCapital is a tool for access. When institutions grow increasingly large, and when skills in demand are increasingly specialized and limited to a handful of individuals, previously respectable capital allows for less access than before.\n\nLess access = less security = less freedom.\n\n\\- \n\nApoploe vesrreaitais illustrates choice in the digital age.\n\nFor every rule, there is a way to bypass that rule. Build a wall as tall as you want. We’ll craft our own wings and fly over it.\n\nApoploe vesrreaitais is meaningful particularly because it is, in fact, meaningless. There is no intent. To view a metaphor here is itself a choice. \n\nIn interpretation we have power.\n\n### Choosing Optimism\n\nPerhaps this is all too serious a take. I would take the side of freedom plainly because **it is more fun.**\n\nIt’s fun to wonder about the endless creativity unlocked when you make better tools and give them to everyone.\n\nIt’s fun to build on what others have made and to watch them build on your own derivative.\n\nIt’s fun to grow a pie with as big a collective as you want.\n\n[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) has a great approach to this. \n\nThey’re a smaller AI company running a paid beta program. Once you’re in, that beta happens on their Discord server. You prompt their bot, and get an image in return.\n\nBy default, this happens in public channels. Which means anyone else can see your prompts and results. They can riff on your ideas, directly ask the bot for variations or upscales of your own pictures.\n\nThis makes for a tremendous resource. Tied with the Discord search tool, you have this live database of pictures and prompts, guiding you towards what you want. Your own actions inspire and help everyone else.\n\n![Midjourney is great at creepy gothic art](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q2qHrPMPPokPZUw5yoSpW.png?height=593&width=593)\n\n### Free Enough\n\nTo be fair, Midjourney has a code of conduct similar to all the other AI companies. We don’t escape that dynamic here.\n\nI personally don’t mind it.\n\nYes, despite all that “fight the power” bit earlier…\n\nI think the way Midjourney does this might be key. Other projects show you scraps of awesome technology. You’re the Oliver Twist orphan staring at pastries through the window, never able to get in. Midjourney lets you apply, then eventually lets you in.\n\nOnce you’re in, you’re with a whole community of people. Sharing ideas in real time.\n\nIt may not be realistic to open up the tools to everyone. Especially as the image generation itself is a taxing process for computer hardware, which costs these companies a serious amount of money.\n\nHowever, there is a right middle point between “fully open” and “only available to vetted insiders”. \n\nIf AI wants to be diverse, it ought to include a diversity of people. In ideology as well as anything else.\n\n### But Does AI Actually Want Anything?\n\nLet’s ask [DALL-E mini](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), a fully opensource model accessible by anyone.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O0DQ9DfyiW8FB8c32jEzg.jpg?height=975&width=866)\n\nI guess the future is blue.", "timestamp": 1654776611, "digest": "lnp1MPB69PGXSivxvTuaC2fL3rufFbGBErOXb_CcMf4", "contributor": "0xBBAc898df94069793F075405f2958733ca45A1D9"}
{"id": "vQtlSqNmdiUF6G0tohcayzU5KQC2uSp9GhbesowYrbg", "title": "How To Learn Crypto As A New Language", "body": "By now, you’ve probably heard about cryptocurrencies. The word crypto seems inescapable: it creeps up in dinner conversations with friends, when complaining about the seemingly never-ending inflation, and in podcasts you listen to every day. \n\nA quick [search on Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=crypto) for the word “crypto” yields the following result. We can see the interest in crypto truly exploded in the past two years.\n\n![Worldwide interest for “crypto” in the past five years, according to Google Trend Explore](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FjzujtNHMHL_7GCURVzLR.png?height=770&width=2292)\n\nOne day, your interest hits a tipping point and you can't take the FOMO anymore. You roll up your sleeves and decide to figure out what exactly crypto is 😤. Except, you find yourself both very excited 🤩 and very lost 😞. \n\nIn this article, I would like to share my experience of breaking into the crypto world – how learning crypto is like learning a new language. I am by no means a crypto native or a polyglot. But, having learned English as a second language, immigrated to the U.S., and somewhat found my footing in the crypto space, I wanted to share my journey and my mental model of how to learn crypto as a language. \n \n\n## Being Crypto Native = Being Fluent in A Language \n\nFirst things first, definitions. According to Merriam-Webster, [native](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/native) means, “belonging to a particular place by birth”, or “natural, normal”. Taken together, if someone is a crypto native, then they are extremely familiar with the crypto space and the crypto landscape has become their “natural” habitat. \n\nOn the other hand, being [fluent](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fluent) in a language means being, “capable of using a language easily and accurately”, or “effortlessly smooth and flowing.” In my humble opinion, when a person is born into or reaches the native fluency of a language, they will not only be able to read, write, and converse in that language fluently but also blend in with that culture and identify as a part of the community. \n\nIn the following paragraphs, I will highlight how crypto mimics a language in four ways: vocabulary, grammar, culture, and identity. \n\n### Vocabulary \n\nI first started being crypto-curious in October 2021. My company had started encouraging us to learn about digital assets. I went to a few panel discussions and decided I wanted to learn more. Then I googled “top crypto/blockchain podcasts” and found my way to shows like *Bankless* and *The Blockchain Insider*. I would go on an hour-long walk every morning and listen to an episode in those early days. It quickly evolved (or perhaps spiraled 😂) to listening to my crypto podcasts while I was cooking, cleaning, or even doing my facial routines 🤷‍♀️.\n\nI knew I had found my new itch. But, it wasn’t always a smooth process. If you saw me on these daily walks, you would probably think I was texting the whole time.  In reality, I was scrambling to my phone every few minutes after hearing some unknown words like “[DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9HYC0EJU6E)”, “[LP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVJzcFDo498)”, “[EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)” and jotting them down in Notes so I could look them up when I get home.\n\n![Terms I didn’t understand so I wrote them down to google later](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jObirdaAuOR-Jd8e2m7xJ.png?height=824&width=662)\n\nLooking back, it struck me that what I was doing was building up my crypto vocabulary 😮. One of the first non-textbook books I ever read in English was Jane Eyre, and I remember highlighting all the unknown words at the first pass so I could look them up later and then read it again.\n\n![Yes, I went and found my Jane Eyre book and took a picture.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6HE_q-JyDIxnUbyz9Q2N.jpeg?height=4032&width=3024)\n\nAs time went on, I was no longer confused by the previously overwhelming amount of strange phrases I would hear from these crypto podcasts. I found myself easily navigating through conversations comparing [L1s to L2s](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-layer-2-network-layer-1-network#section-what-is-blockchain-scalability), and deep dives into [NFTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dkl5O9LOKg) and [DAOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHm0uUPqmVE). It’s all about the vocabulary. Once I got the basic terminologies down, I was able to understand crypto. Or, so I thought (spoiler alert, I was very wrong 🫠). \n\n### Culture & Identity\n\nIn late November, I found myself overly enthusiastic about crypto compared to my friends. If you mention the word crypto to me, I could go on a monologue for quite a long time. I was happy, but lonely. I felt isolated in my joy and thirst for crypto. I didn’t have anyone to [WAGMI](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wagmi) with nor ape into some cool NFTs together 😢.\n\nAt the same time, I also realized I was consuming a lot of content but not doing anything. Sure, I could understand all these crypto podcasts almost perfectly, but what good does that do? I wanted to do something in the space and meet some friends who were equally excited about crypto. \n\nComing from a data science background, I started reading Medium articles about blockchain data in hopes of doing some modeling projects with Ethereum’s open and public data. In Mid-December, I read a piece from [Andrew Hong](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297) about “[SQL on Ethereum](https://towardsdatascience.com/sql-on-ethereum-how-to-work-with-all-the-data-from-a-transaction-103f94f902e5)”. I saw his intro included a link to [his LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hong-nyc/). Encouraged by my inner voice who so wanted to make friends in crypto, I reached out and asked for a coffee chat. I wasn’t really sure what would happen, but I convinced myself it wouldn’t hurt to try. The worst that could happen was a no.\n\n![My first message to Andrew on LinkedIn asking for a coffee chat](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KLncwCn1gushzkF410p65.png?height=622&width=982)\n\nAs you can see, Andrew responded a minute later, telling me he would be happy to connect. This was my first welcoming message to the crypto world. From here on, many people whom I reached out to would respond the same way – friendly, welcoming, encouraging, and accepting. \n\nIn our initial chat, Andrew told me about his journey into crypto. He explained to me why things like the ethos of ETH vs. BTC and why they were built are important to understand, as well as shared helpful resources on how I could level up in the crypto data land. Fast forward six months, Andrew would turn out to be one of my strongest connections in the crypto space. He not only helped me grow technically but also introduced me to other connections and exposed me to the open-source, community-driven culture in the space. (P.S. Many of the connections I’ve made are through the [web3 data degen](http://ilemi.pallet.com/talent) group that Andrew started. Please do consider applying and join us!)\n\n![I dug up notes I took from my first coffee chat with Andrew.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-hWfZneXvgFnrgH5w7Xxb.jpeg?height=4032&width=3024)\n\nBack to mid-December, a few hours after messaging Andrew and encouraged by the positive feedback, I decided to send a friend request to [Nic Carter](https://twitter.com/nic__carter) and ask to meet up as well. I first saw him on a panel discussion my company hosted on The Intersection of Bitcoin and Sustainability. Since then, I’ve come to learn that he is a very active member in the crypto space. I wanted to hear his journey from TradFi to crypto and then co-founding Coin Metrics and doing VC. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as I have come to learn time and again how open and friendly people are in the space, he accepted my friend request a day later and we scheduled a time to grab coffee.\n\n![The message I included in my friend request to Nic](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yL3ERhrxLbS_Y462hsPjS.png?height=366&width=986)\n\n![How I asked for a coffee chat with Nic](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TXbFlDSUr_5bltysj0Y31.png?height=770&width=844)\n\nIn early 2022, I participated in hackathons hosted by [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) and tried to flip NFTs with my [IRL](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=irl) friends. I started to realize that reaching out on LinkedIn is kind of a web2 thing and in the crypto/web3 land you reach out via Twitter, Discord, and/or Telegram. \n\nAlthough I had known about [Dune](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards) since November 2021, it was not until March/April 2022 that I started doing on-chain analysis and creating dashboards there. [Boxer](https://twitter.com/0xBoxer) from Dune actually gave me the idea for the first dashboard I published on the [State of Ethereum Quarterly Report](https://dune.com/agaperste/The-State-of-Ethereum-Network), and how I got to talk to him was again, through me reaching out for a coffee chat. Although, this time it was on Twitter instead of on LinkedIn 😛.\n\n![My first DM to Boxer asking for a coffee chat](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S9THWL0y0KOyyeHbk8NY0.png?height=840&width=1178)\n\nAround the same time, I finally decided to pop into [MetricsDAO](https://metricsdao.xyz/)’s discord. I had heard about MetricsDAO in a passing *Bankless* episode. I knew they were a group of people passionate about on-chain data analysis. Because of my interest in crypto and data, I thought this might be a good community to explore and join. Even though it was not that long ago, the details of how I joined are already a blur 😅. But what I do remember is the “overwhelming” amount of reception and support I felt from [Danner](https://twitter.com/drakedanner) when I joined. He offered to walk me through all the channels in MetricsDAO (for anyone who’s on Discord, you understand the struggle 😂), and I took him up on the offer.\n\n![My first Discord DM with Danner](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EpbR0Z-PvRcVlysBzl7bd.png?height=522&width=2064)\n\nDue to the encouragement of existing members, the permissionless nature of DAO, and the pods set up at MetricsDAO, the path to becoming a member was very easy. Soon, I was contributing to different pods of MetricsDAO and making friends while growing my skills. One day, on a pod weekly call, I got to meet [Chuxin](https://twitter.com/chuxin_h). She is a data scientist who’s also keen on crypto and an active contributor in the space. As a fellow Asian female in the crypto data space, I had wanted to get to know her for a while. After the call ended, I just decided to reach out and we got connected.\n\n![My first Discord DM with Chuxin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9MZ7LmmYP-LHKjVG4Vhub.png?height=862&width=2104)\n\nGradually, I no longer felt alone on my crypto journey. I started to understand the different ethos of Bitcoin and Ethereum. I started to find my tribe through web3 data degens group and MetricsDAO. I now have real friends who I vibe with about crypto, data, and analytics. I am in Telegram and Discord chats where members care about things I care about. \n\nWhile I am still finding my community and formulating my identity in the crypto space, I know that I am on a journey with like-minded people. \n\nLooking back, this experience again mirrors the culture and identity aspects of learning a language. When I immigrated to the U.S., besides learning how to order water in English, I also learned that Americans like to drink their water cold with ice, whereas back at home we prefer hot water more often than not. Language, culture, and identity are so intertwined. When you learn a language, you inevitably discover the context surrounding that language and the communities using that language. You eventually start identifying with certain ideas and groups of people 🥰. You eventually find your community 🏡.  \n\n### Grammar \n\nAt a high level, the [definition of grammar](https://writer.com/blog/what-is-grammar-grammar-definition-and-examples/) is “a system of rules that allow us to structure sentences”. This is another area where crypto parallels a language. \n\nWith a language, you have a set of governing, composable rules that you follow to form sentences and compose articles and speeches. [For example](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/rules.htm), a sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark. Also, in English, subjects come before verbs, which then come before objects. \n\nSimilarly, with crypto, you have a set of [token standards](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/tokens) and [smart contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWGLtjG-F5c&t=1s) which you follow and build upon to create [dApps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPIupbsVimc) and a vibrant ecosystem. For example, if you are creating an NFT, then you follow [ERC-721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721) standard to create this non-fungible token collection. If you want to understand the [DeFi space](https://twitter.com/puntium/status/1493417236660318208?s=20&t=EWYi-GyYXa2NIP3V88Zfpg), then you follow the path of: 1) learn what [fungible tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) are → 2) learn what automated markets ([AMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PbZMudPP5E)) and [decentralized exchanges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tTVJL4bpTU) are → 3) learn what [automated lending and borrowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTp9er6S73M) are → 4) learn what automated investment strategy is (e.g. [Yearn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1goOptZ5w)). Afterward, you can use these concepts as rules and building blocks to help you understand or build new products in the crypto space. \n\n## Learn Crypto as A New Language\n\nNow that we have established why being a crypto native is like being fluent in a language, how do we approach learning crypto as if we were learning a natural language? \n\n### 🌊 Be Immersive\n\nWhen I was learning English, I made sure everything I did was in English. Besides going to an English speaking school every day (which was not necessarily a deliberate choice but more a byproduct of me immigrating to the U.S. and a precursor to me needing to learn English), I also changed my phone settings to English, switched to only watching English movies and listening to English songs, tried to write diaries in English, and even made sure every time I was counting something I  did so in English. You get it; the point was to completely immerse myself in that language, in all possible ways. Eventually, the magic moment happened – I started having dreams in English 🙌! Within six months of coming to the U.S., I could understand what teachers were teaching, what classmates were talking about, and carry smooth conversations of my own. \n\nWhen it comes to crypto, I believe it’s very helpful to take the same immersive approach. Plant crypto-related content throughout your routine. Twitter? Crypto-related accounts – [@spencernoon](https://twitter.com/spencernoon), [@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie), [@ljin18](https://twitter.com/ljin18), [@MessariCrypto](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto), [@CryptoGucci](https://twitter.com/CryptoGucci) (it’s impossible to name all of them, but you get the idea, go surf!). Podcast? Crypto-related shows – *Bankless*, *Blockhain Insider*, *The Delphi Podcast*, *The Bad Crypto Podcast*… YouTube? Crypto-related channels – [Finematics](https://www.youtube.com/c/Finematics), [Whiteboard Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteboardCrypto). Side hustles? Crypto-related projects – build dashboards on [Dune](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards) or [Flipside](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity), start leveling up through [RabbitHole’s](https://app.rabbithole.gg/quests) quests. When you spend all your available time living and breathing in the crypto space, it’s hard not to become fluent in this new language. \n\n### 👊 Make Friends\n\nOne of the most effective ways to learn a new language is to make friends who speak it natively. Through interactive conversations, you not only get to practice but also will pick up some slang or pop culture references and get the flow of things much faster. Since you want to have fun with your friends, you will be motivated to try harder. Conversely, your friends will also want to help you get better as quickly as possible.\n\nIt’s the same thing when it comes to crypto. Make crypto native friends. Talk to the people who have already found their way in. As I have shared, anywhere is a good starting point – LinkedIn, Twitter, Discord etc. If you see content you like, don’t be afraid to DM the authors. If you are new to a Discord channel, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. I am not going to lie; I still constantly struggle with, “Am I bothering them?” vs. “Nah I should just do it.” But, echoing my anecdotal evidence above, I really believe most people in the space are very approachable. They are always so willing to connect and help you find your way to your crypto journey.  \n\nYou will level up skills faster with their guidance and start picking up crypto culture by being in the vicinity. These conversations and developing relationships will certainly expedite your crypto learning journey. \n\n### 🧱 Build the Foundation \n\nUnless it’s your mother tongue, mastering any language requires you to put in the hard work of memorizing vocabulary and learning the grammar. Without knowing enough words, no matter how many English songs you listen to or how many English-speaking friends you make, you will never become fluent. If the structural rules of the language evade you, it’s nearly impossible to make sense of all the words. \n\nCrypto is no different. As previously mentioned, at its foundation, crypto as a language also consists of vocabulary and grammar. Therefore, the same method one uses to acquire new words and study grammar can also be applied. For example, when encountering new vocabulary in conversations or articles, write them down and look up the definitions. If you want to investigate a sector, grasp the building block knowledge first to equip yourself with conceptual understanding so that you can navigate anything new thereafter. For example, in order to understand the DeFi sector, you must first learn what [ERC-20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) tokens are, what Liquidity Pools are about, and why Automated Market Maker was invented. Then you can advance to researching automated lending and borrowing platforms, such as Aave and Compound, and start experimenting with investment strategies like Yearn and Alchemix.\n\n### 🚀 “Go Abroad”\n\nA popular piece of advice people give to learn a new language is to go abroad. It totally makes sense. Once you are in a country that speaks the language, you are forced to be present in that environment. It becomes much easier to make friends with native speakers. The key here is to create that immersive experience for yourself and find support when you need it. \n\nWith the existence of the Internet and how everything in crypto is built, “going abroad” has never been easier. For crypto as a language, going abroad means using whatever protocols or dApps you are learning, reading their whitepapers or articles on Mirror and Medium, following their Twitter accounts, and hopping into their Discord channels to meet other community members of the same product. If you want to understand what Aave v3 is all about, put some money in (*not financial advice*), and try out different functionalities. If you want to see what a DAO is about, join the DAO, talk to the people there, and start contributing. \n\n### 🏄 Have Fun!\n\nLife is about the journey, not the destination. When learning a natural language, it’s not just about becoming fluent. It’s about opening doors to new experiences. While learning a language, you get to learn about the culture and history surrounding that language. Equipped with the new language, you are able to travel around and converse with the local people. \n\nIn the land of crypto, the possibilities are similarly endless. It’s not just about becoming a crypto native. After all, the crypto language is just a conduit. You are learning crypto because you feel a sense of attraction; you want to satisfy your curiosity, unlock new experiences, make some new friends, and find a community you belong to in the space. \n\nSo, while some days it is about the grind, don’t forget to enjoy yourself along the way. Take a pause and smell the flowers. Give yourself a pat on the back and feel proud of what you have done. \n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nThe old proverb says, “all roads lead to Rome”. Everyone has their own unique ways of learning a new language and the paths they take to get into crypto. I want to stress that I am by no means a crypto native or a polyglot. I share my journey and thoughts on learning crypto as a new language in hopes that this can be somewhat helpful to those with a similar curiosity. Please reach out if you feel alone on this journey, as I did a few months ago, or just want to chat about crypto and get excited together. \n\nLast but not least, I want to thank everyone who has helped me and supported me on my journey so far 🙏. Without you, my experience would certainly not have been the same 🫶.\n\n*Special thanks to [Brandon Mason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-mason-02b41b123/), [Andrew Hong](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297), and [Chuxin Huang](https://twitter.com/chuxin_h) for editing, providing constructive feedback, and proofreading this piece!* \n \n\n \n  \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1654776592, "digest": "NasJaAer9uBNzO3w4qdHDoxJP7yRDYLcZqRSod_TJ8A", "contributor": "0xB10F35351fF21bb81dC02D4FD901Ac5AE34E8Dc4"}
{"id": "xRfblwap-LN84NUp-D4aRWHitydM0YaYlrDDjaBc3gw", "title": "Common Protocol白皮书 v1.0 用户拥有的社区", "body": "## 介绍\n\n加密协议默认为开放，这意味着重要的战略决策在公共场合得到讨论、资助和批准。\nCommon是默认开放的：透明的线程讨论，而不是匿名的话语论坛，全方位的投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。Common使用链上社交图谱为任何标记化社区提供直观的界面 - 第1层，DeFi协议，NFT持有者或投资DAO。\n\n用户只需链接一个钱包，就可以立即加入社区以获取他们持有的代币;极大地增加了很多使用案例。代币是常见的接触点，“链上事件”是有趣的互动，例如鲸鱼转移和治理投票。\n社区拥有自己的空间并访问一体化工具，提供讨论论坛，利益相关者分析，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n\n除了作为一个产品之外，Common还旨在成为一个完全分散的社交网络和众筹协议，其长期目标是允许开发人员利用一组丰富的社交和资金原语来帮助发展自己的代币化协议。本文件概述了《共同议定书》的要素。\n\n## 协议概述\n\n作为一个协议，我们结合了几个关键功能，使个人和项目能够运行分散的社区。通过这种方式，我们类似于具有内置资金原始的加密Reddit。这使得社区和社会团体能够为公共产品提供资金，无信任地汇集资金，并调节/控制他们的社区，而无需依赖自上而下的治理模式。\n\n标识和信誉：每个用户和社区都与一个命名空间相关联。\n\n* 命名空间：用户或社区的特定子域\n* 信誉：每个命名空间将具有关联的信誉数据\n\n社区：链接到 DAO 拥有的社区的名称空间\n\n* 私人：一个封闭的社区，特定的用户地址可以加入进来，私下交谈和构建。\n* 门控：由现有 DAO 拥有的社区，其本机令牌可以限制对内容的访问，并且可以集中用于委派和投资。\n* 公共：由 CMN DAO 拥有的社区，不需要购买/维护子域，但功能有限。\n\n用户：链接到可以添加角色的特定配置文件的命名空间\n\n* 管理员：为特定社区提供完全权限的角色\n* 主持人：为特定社区提供有限权限的角色\n* 策展人：为众筹活动提供晋升权利的角色\n\n资金：通过具有赎回能力的主导保证合同进行众筹\n\n* 项目：用于筹集类似Kickstarter的众筹\n* 集体：将资本汇集到捐赠基金或投资基金中\n\nChain：用于内容分散存储的智能合约链，协议激励和社交应用程序平台。\n\n## 命名空间和标识\n\n社区和用户可以在 \\[name\\] 处声明唯一的 NFT （EIP 1155） 标识符。common.xyz。公共协议的核心是这些标识符的注册表。\n对于社区，用户的CMN池化将其作为命名空间的出价进行抵押。然后，拍卖的获胜者必须支付固定费用，并保留其令牌以保留命名空间的所有权。CMN 已为社区命名空间抵押的用户是 DAO 社区的共同所有者，DAO社区获得的任何奖励都将分配给DAO的所有者。\n\n对于用户，个人需要支付固定费用才能声明可用的用户命名空间，这些命名空间能够通过web2身份Twitter进行验证，以进行sybil-resistance（即公开发布带有签名消息的Twitter帐户证明）。经过验证的用户命名空间可以在不同的社区中担任各种角色，并获得不可替代的声誉，CMN用户奖励和社区奖励。\n\n我们预计命名空间将获得用户名（u / dillchen），社区名称（c / dydx），主题（c / evm）和利基兴趣（c / john-wick）的声明。我们预计在拍卖所有权之外持有几个流行名称的所有权，例如3个字母名称和其他现有令牌，以便在证明所述令牌的所有权后进行转让。\n\n## 社区作为道DAOS\n\nCommon上的每个社区都是一个DAO。这使我们能够摆脱传统web2平台使用的单片审核模型，并使特定社区能够准确选择如何管理自己的社区。社区可以围绕成员资格角色、审核和交互指定社区策略。\n社区DAO能够利用加密基础设施。每个社区都能够管理一个资金库，为社区项目创建众筹提案，并可以选择从这些众筹中赚取费用。我们将在资金部分对此进行更多讨论。\n\n注册：当社区确定一个开放的命名空间时，他们希望注册一个拍卖期开始。如果社区希望保持私密性，他们可以将允许为其命名空间出价做出贡献的特定用户列入白名单。\n如果一个社区更愿意保持公开，而不是由代币社区拥有，他们可以提交0的出价。假设另一个竞标者没有出现，他们将在一段时间内赢得命名空间，但它将由CMN DAO拥有。\n捐赠基金：社区可以选择创建一个集体（稍后会详细介绍），社区成员可以在其中抵押资产。然后，这些集体可以投资资产并收取一定比例的套利，该套利归DAO（对于公共社区，一部分套利归CMN DAO）。集体也可以充当“超级代表”，代表社区投票。\n质量管理：CMN代币持有者可以投票禁止社区的不良行为。如果一个社区被禁止，他们将失去他们的命名空间，并且他们的一部分抵押令牌将被削减并提供给CMN DAO。对于公共社区，与被禁止社区关联的用户将被阻止在一段时间内加入公共社区。\n\n每个社区包括：\n用户注册表\n角色，由社区投票并由客户填充\n全球声誉评分\n（可选）集体捐赠\n（可选）费用规则\n选择众筹和其他互动的费用比例将进入受益人地址\n有几种类型的社区，根据成员集和治理规则而有所不同。我们在下面详细介绍了它们。\n\n## 令牌门控社区\n\n封闭式社区允许用户将其令牌与社区相关联。这允许任何拥有该令牌的人获得对所述Common社区和论坛的权力。例如，AAVE 社区可能决定利用 AAVE 令牌来主持 [commonwealth.im/aave](http://commonwealth.im/aave) 论坛。\n持有指定令牌的用户能够访问令牌持有者的特定渠道，对治理提案进行投票以及其他特定于社区的好处。\n门控令牌的令牌权重是根据每个地址持有的金额计算的。未来的迭代可以使用二次融资公式来确定通过门控令牌持有的声誉数量。\n\n## 社区coin\n\n没有原生代币的社区可以选择通过自己的社区硬币进行管理。社区硬币是在有利于早期买家的债券曲线（具有CMN储备）上铸造的。用于购买创作者硬币的CMN储备被押在网络上，为创作者赚取收益。\n创造者硬币曲线是以下形式的幂函数：\n\nx是储备资产（CMN），而y是社区硬币的价格。m 和 n 控制曲线的倾斜度，c 降低并抬起曲线。我们预计CMN治理将为社区添加不同的曲线，以支持不同的用例。\n\n## 众筹\n\nCommon包括项目众筹和集体（例如投资DAO）的原语。社区还可以使用这些基元来启动新的 DAO。\n一个项目从一群支持者中筹集，就像Kickstarter活动一样。除非达到预定的筹款目标，否则支持者将无法获得项目解锁的资产。如果项目在截止日期前没有达到筹款目标，则资助者将收回其抵押资产。\n\nCommon使用策展人（通过占主导地位的保证合同）作为发起人/辛迪加的额外角色来帮助资助项目。策展人将金融资产（及其相关声誉）押在该项目上，直到达到最后期限或目标。如果未达到目标，策展人的抵押资产将分配给支持者及其支持者。\n这种建设使支持者摆脱了冷漠，因为支持者在资助项目方面获得了“双赢”的局面。如果项目资金发生，他们会得到他们想要的好处，如果项目资金失败，那么他们就会得到他们的存款和额外的奖励。\n\n## 寻求资金的项目\n\n项目创建寻求资金的链上提案。这将启动一个智能合约，为收到的资金提供存款地址。除了项目的基本信息外，项目创建者还需要指定：\n筹款目标\n接受的货币或代币\n限期\n支持者奖励（可选）：附加奖励，如NFT或基于任何bondi的比例支持的奖励\n策展人分配（可选）：策展人可以来源的筹款目标百分比\n策展人奖励（可选）：捐赠给策展人的总金额的一部分\n如果项目没有选择策展人奖励，那么该项目将被视为传统的众筹项目。\n\n## 策展人抵押资产\n\n在研究中，通过主要保证合同引入策展人，每个项目的成功项目融资率和筹集金额都翻了一番。策展人通过将代币押在他们认可的项目上来展示游戏中的皮肤。\n为了表明这激励了项目获得资助，请考虑一个项目成功融资的可能性为零的情况。在这种情况下，供款金额小于资助金额。当资助者要获得退款奖金时，新的支持者必须能够通过略微增加其贡献来增加其退款奖金。\n\n在这种情况下，总供款仍将少于所需的总金额。随着新支持者贡献边际金额，最终达到阈值。到达最后一个支持者，假设该项目的价值大于零，则始终有一定金额的该支持者将为该项目提供资金。\n如果一个项目成功获得资助，策展人将获得总资助金额的一部分（预计约为5%）。如果项目未能达到其融资目标，策展人的抵押代币将给予项目支持者。这种奖励激励策展人积极搜索项目并将其与支持者联系起来。最初，他们还受到CMN代币使用挖掘奖励的激励，这些奖励专门针对策展人。\n\n虽然任何人都可以担任策展人，但大多数成功的策展人除了金融资本外，还将拥有一些声誉资本。在加密领域，策展人可能是项目本身、基金会、有影响力的个人或DAO。在加密之外，策展人可能是大学实验室，非营利组织，科学期刊或其他想要支持特定事业或一群人的个人。\n策展人将财务和声誉资本投入到线上，以帮助项目筹款取得成功。任何人都可以担任策展人，策展人可以自由选择哪些提案。对项目的策展人数量或策展人筹集的资金没有上限。\n为了确保策展人和项目不会串通起来进行欺诈，策展人的股份可以通过CMN治理行动来削减。\n\n## 资助项目的支持者\n\n支持者可以从许多项目中进行选择。策展人的股份既是质量的信号，也是可能的经济回报，这让支持者摆脱了冷漠，默认为项目提供资金。\n\n资助项目现在是一个“双赢”的局面。如果项目未达到其门槛，则除了按比例分配的策展人权益资产外，还将退还资助者的资金。如果筹款活动成功，资助者将获得他们想要的共同奖励。\n\n## 创建长期集体\n\n为共同利益而建设的项目往往难以筹集资金。对于智能合约审计或研究等技术项目来说，这尤其困难。缺乏资金导致艺术家和科学家不断追逐资金，分散了他们对创作行为的注意力。\nCommon通过让个人和社区创建集体来解决这个问题。集体像项目筹款活动一样开始，但有三个额外的参数。\n策略：标的资产的担保人认可的投资策略\n套利：给予集体创造者的已产生利润的百分比\n治理权：集体或支持者是否保留治理权\n\n对于旨在使共同利益的集体，集体可以使用低风险的收益产生策略并设定高套利率。这使得支持者能够保持其初始资产，但为创作者提供透明，可持续的资金。\n在集体作为投资工具的情况下，经理必须在筹款过程中预先批准投资策略，并获得任何后来添加的策略的治理批准。然后，在评估其投资时，支持者可以评估创作者的声誉，链上投资历史，策略和策展人支持。\n\n在一个旨在成为“超级代表”的集体的情况下，一个由志同道合的人组成的社区有能力轻松地将许多不同治理代币的投票权与创建者汇集在一起。我们设想这类似于一个拥有财务和代表权的工会。\n\n## bTokens 和 cTokens\n\n当支持者和策展人参与项目和集体时，代币就会被铸造出来。为了赎回标的抵押品，他们烧掉相应的b或cToken。bTokens和cTokens类似于不同类别的代币化可转换债券。\n对于支持者来说，bTokens对策展人的抵押品，他们自己的股份以及项目创建者提供的任何其他代币有权利要求，作为为市场提供资金的额外激励（又名代币发布）。\n\ncTokens（策展人Tokens）被铸造为策展人的赌注进入项目。它们代表对按项目筹集的总额5%的费用比例的索赔。虽然bTokens本质上是无风险的，但如果项目资金不成功，cTokens会带来一些风险。虽然cTokens能够从项目筹集中获得潜在收益，或者从DeFi中使用的集体资产中获得持续的兴趣流。\n\n这些令牌是新的DeFi原语，并由未来的项目构建。例如，可以将几个bTokens或cTokens捆绑在一个索引中，以形成一组研究支持的令牌。个人可以根据特定集体资助的研究数量获得现金流。个人可以通过“抵押或支持项目”，然后在二级市场上出售代币来做空。\n\n## 链\n\nCommon是用一个直观的客户端构建的，供用户到社区和用户利用。在未来，为了确保每次互动和所有内容都是分散的和抗审查的，我们将利用一个独立的区块链，即Common Chain。\n\n与基于金钱的用例不同，社交互动本质上是可并行化的，即鲍勃和查理都可以回复爱丽丝的帖子。这可以重新思考不同的应用程序如何在区块链环境中运行。考虑到这一点，Common Chain是一个专为社交应用程序构建的分片，WASM和EVM区块链。\n\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，新的开发人员和创始人可以利用该链来创建新的体验分层体验，并基于所有用户交互构建开放式社交和声誉图。Common链包括几个关键原语，使其成为专门用于社会和治理交互的基元，主要功能包括：\n\n项目级元交易：链上的大多数用户交互都是轻量级的。用户不必为喜欢或转发等互动付费。相反，项目本身将能够中继和支付链上用户行为可能产生的费用（例如州增长和存储租金）。这类似于DeFi协议激励分散式预言机的方式，而不是要求用户为自己的预言机付费。\n\n项目可以通过分配一部分新的应用程序治理令牌来激励这一点，以换取第三方CMN令牌持有者代表他们进行权益。在这种情况下，项目级元交易可以直接从第三方抵押人未获得的CMN质押奖励中扣除。未来的改进可能允许项目直接竞标一定数量的区块空间或安全性。\n\n## 可扩展存储：\n\nCommon的存储后端将是分散的，通过使用固定服务将社交数据存储在IPFS，Filecoin和/或Arweave上。我们希望将我们的数据库移植到Canvas，这是一个使Common前端独立于的执行层，允许将讨论嵌入到DAO，DeFi协议和Web周围的其他地方。\n\n基于阈值的会话密钥：应用程序上的每个交互（例如，在公共治理平台上的帖子，喜欢或评论）都通过应用程序和用户的地址进行公开签名和批处理。除了用户之外，应用程序还需要运行节点来公开对消息进行签名。\n委派访问密钥（例如会话密钥）是按 （d） 应用程序生成的，允许链区分每个应用程序的使用情况。允许用户无需对每篇帖子进行授权。会话密钥将能够在用户确定的时间内保持有效，类似于需要登录的传统 Web 应用程序上存储的会话。\n\n在最严重的威胁模型（例如，被盗的计算机）下，最坏的情况是欺诈性作者身份。用户将能够通过重新验证其链上地址来社交恢复其密钥对。将来，添加新设备将非常容易，只需在新设备上创建新的签名密钥，然后将该密钥发送到原始设备以由钱包签名即可。这类似于流行的消息传递应用程序（如Telegram和Signal）使用的2FA过程。\n\n通过使用不可提取属性生成密钥，并基于每个应用程序进行存储。这意味着根本无法导出私钥 - 私钥只能用于在加载它的应用程序上对内容进行签名。此外，允许Common Chain通过基于令牌的激励措施激励用户和应用程序开发。\n身份：通过集成到通用名称空间中，跨应用程序的经过验证的地址将能够从本机交易，自动gas退款和项目补贴费用等功能中受益。\n随着Common上社区网络的增长，开发人员和创始人可以利用该链为这些社区和新用户创造新的体验。\n\n## CMN DAO 和 CMN Token\n\nCommon将使用原生令牌CMN来激励整个生态系统中所有参与者的良好行为。CMN将作为团结社区的激励措施，用于策展人费用和命名空间的令牌，以及协议的治理令牌。\n这与Kickstarter和Facebook等系统形成鲜明对比，在这些系统中，所有权不与成功普及每个平台的项目（即Pebble），应用程序/组（即Zynga）和用户（即大学生）共享。\n\n## CommonDAO 治理\n\n在Common Governance Token推出后，协议的未来发展和方向将由Common DAO决定。在发布时，21%的代币供应将分配给DAO金库，以确保对协议的长期支持。永久的、协议控制的发行将用于激励验证者、核心和应用程序开发人员以及用户等。\n\n投票模式\nCommon 协议最初将利用赌注加权投票过程。在未来，作为nampespace amtures，利用二次投票模型，只允许已经验证其命名空间的钱包参与治理。这使得分配给大型代币持有者的投票权减少，同时保持了Sybil的抵抗力。\n\n道国库\nCommon DAO的初始治理项目之一将是启动一个集体，其中很大一部分CMN代币将投资于低风险，产生收益的策略。这些策略应该能够为CMN市场提供一致的被动收入流和增加的流动性。这种被动收入将使DAO能够为未来的发展提供可持续的收入来源。\n\n## 内容和审核\n\n共同治理模型的一个主要组成部分是帮助调节平台。集中式web2社交平台和工具遭受单点故障。Common允许一位创始人或多数利益相关者进行公共讨论。\n\n相反，Common分散了这一责任。审核通过社区标记不良行为者的过程进行。不良行为者（即违反社区规范的命名空间）受到CMN权益加权投票过程的约束，其中惩罚可能是削减权益，限制某些平台行为或将名称归还给Common DAO所有权。回收的命名空间将公开拍卖。渐渐地，DAO将制定有关不良行为和声誉评分的复杂规则。\n\n抵押和通货膨胀\n为了使共同协议发挥作用，向所有利益相关者发展，有各种激励率由管理DAO控制。首先，这些利率将被设定为正利率，并由未来的直接发行提供资金。\nCommon预计通胀率为5%，激励措施将分配给一组利益相关者。\n40%的通货膨胀分配给验证者\n10%的通货膨胀分配给协议控制的国库\n50%的通货膨胀用于激励措施\n\n## 激励网络角色\n\n在网络的早期生命周期中，激励能够以编程方式针对特定行为进行分发。治理能够投票并指定链上行为，奖励金额以及为特定链上分配的指定供应量。而不是白板流动性挖掘计划，治理将能够针对对各种合约的设定时间段调用。该网络将使用几个临时激励进行初始化：\n\n资助者：调用createCollective、createProject、curate 和 back合约调用的地址。这些地址将因执行操作以及基于存入或筹集的金额而获得CMN的份额。\n社区： 创建声明命名空间的社区将根据其已验证的用户注册总数来声明奖励，其池将在设定的时间段内按比例分配。\n用户： 注册的用户将获得注册的标准奖励。在未来，我们预计这将在基于链接信誉协议的积极参与社区之间进行拆分。\n开发人员：Common上的开发人员将能够为某些社区里程碑申请一组赠款。此外，我们将包括一个用于“应用程序质押”的设置令牌供应。允许用户在他们喜欢的应用程序上下注，并允许开发人员选择向其抵押人分摊费用。未来，我们预计治理将采用特定的链上KPI，以允许不同的应用类别。\nBD奖励：（总供应量的2%，由BD赠款委员会管理）\n社区入职：自定义邀请链接将推荐奖励归因于用户/社区\n\n每个激励措施都可以在个人层面上得到提升，通过将CMN押向特定地址以获得奖励。\n\n## 使用案例\n\n主要社区市场\n作为一个社区平台，我们看到不同的加密社区。通用协议可以提供所有这些社区价值：\n基础链 - 这些是主要的第 1 层和第 2 层生态系统。想想以太坊，Avalanche，Solana，Polygon，Arbitrum等。它们是大多数dApp构建的层，并且有兴趣为其生态系统开发工具。此工具可以是金融协议，DAO基础架构，技术原语或模块等。\nDeFi协议 - 这些是专注于金融用例的特定协议，通常具有相似的优先级。假设他们有一个治理令牌，他们的DAO主要集中在投资协议的开发，与其他DeFi协议集成，列出资产以及监管协议激励。\nNFT社区 - 与传统协议不同，NFT社区的成员资格和治理仅适用于整个令牌。这些社区也没有需要技术开发的基本协议，而是需要改进的社区和一组视觉资产。\n投资DAOs - 投资DAOs使集团能够为共同的投资策略汇集资源。这些可能看起来像PartyBids，OlympusDAO，ConstitutionDAO或PleasrDAO。根据这些组织的具体结构，他们将对投资组合开发和投资审批有不同的需求。\n应用链 - 与基础链略有不同，应用程序链是更专业的区块链，旨在为dApp的特定子部分提供支持，而不是任何dApp的通用机器。这些社区需要具体说明它们的目的是什么，并评估技术调整以完美契合产品与市场。\n\n## 前景\n\n任何类型的加密社区都可以利用通用协议来帮助协调集体问题的公共资源。这些是我们看到机会的一些用例。\n\n透明、全方位的社区管理。目前，大多数加密社区都依赖于不透明的Web2社区管理工具，如Telegram，Discord和Discourse，这些工具都容易受到Sybil攻击，并增加了社区治理的摩擦。通用协议支持经过验证的身份（就像一个链接的钱包一样多，就像一个经过验证的Twitter或GitHub帐户一样）和端到端的治理。将线程与民意调查，链下投票，链上投票，资金赠款和众筹联系起来，可实现全方位的社区支持。\n\n为社交代币，艺术和科学发展创建社区基金。像$ALEX或$FWB这样的代币在协调志同道合的人方面做得很好，但它往往就此结束。通过创建一个集体且只接受$ALEX或$FWB，个人可以共同资助项目。这一原则也可以扩展到那些想要资助艺术家，研究机构和开发团队的人。将代币存入集体可以让个人向创作者提供收益并保持基础资产的所有权。\n\n现有项目的赏金、开发人员工具和研究。超过200亿美元的资金来自团队和社区，其目的取决于工具生态系统。然而，这些钱包，用户界面，甚至研究人员往往没有可持续的商业模式。生态系统可以增加其现有的资金库，以众筹特定工具。例如，Synthetix和Polkadot可以将他们的10亿美元以上的国债分配给一个集体或项目，以资助有用的工具，通用的基础设施和对项目有用的小赏金。Gitcoin已经在小规模上这样做了。\n\n增加获得高性能投资的机会。目前，许多表现最好的金融资产都无法进入更广泛的市场。在一个新项目从DAO筹集赠款后，他们然后过渡到传统的风险投资，直到他们最终推出代币。这些早期投资往往是表现最好的。此外，大多数投资基金对大多数投资者都是封锁的。利用分散的投资集体，可以让更多的人参与到顶级的投资工具和银团中来。\n\n作为工会和养老基金的DAO。工会、养老金和合作社帮助志同道合的个人汇集资源，以支持共同的利益。这些组织经常利用集体谈判，集中投票权和多样化的资产管理来推进集体。共同协议通过共同社区和集体使这些工作组成为可能。将资产委托给社区集体可以实现加密“超级代表”和共同资产管理。\n\n面向开发人员的分销渠道。Common是一个开放的协议，随着开发人员和创始人开发新的有价值的产品，他们可以建立在Common的流动性和共享的社交图谱上。这些整合将使社区能够轻松采用新工具，将其集成到其共享空间中，如果该工具为共同协议筹集资金，甚至可能参与上行。\n\n## 总结\n\nCommon是默认开放：线程讨论而不是私人电子邮件，透明的链上投票而不是幕后交易，以及用户控制的资本，以帮助创建和发展任何项目或兴趣。\n社区能够拥有自己的空间，可以即时访问一体化工具，包括讨论论坛，查看关键利益相关者，链上治理，聊天渠道和众筹。\n除了作为一个产品，Common的目标是成为一个完全分散的社交链和图表。该生态系统将包括众筹和开发人员工具，以帮助开发人员发展自己的标记化协议。\n虽然Common Protocol最初将在EVM兼容链上推出，但明年将推出特定于应用程序的社交链，以降低交易费用，改善用户体验，并实现真正的跨链治理和协作。\n\n## 相关工作\n\n· AngelList / Kickstarter / Patreon / GofundMe / Github Sponsors.除了与GP共享经济学的AngelList基金外，这些平台不会奖励策展人，而是为平台本身收取费用。\n\n· Mirror / Zora / Foundation / Rarible / SuperRare /[ Async.art/](https://async.art/) ：这些项目中的大多数都侧重于创建/激励已经制作的项目，或具有艺术和/或转售价值的收藏品。Common通过让个人为NFT或收藏品进行众筹来增强这些项目。\n\n· 社交代币：常见的项目将能够限制为一组特定的社交代币参与者。社交代币社区将能够创建一个社区集体，汇集资金并创建新项目。\n\n· Gitcoin / QV / CLR.fund：这是一个复杂的筹资机制，需要捐助者提供的资金相匹配。此外，它目前存在身份问题，因为对手可能会将许多传播代币欺骗到小账户中。\n\n· Circles, Camaraderie (Discord和其他)：非标记化社区平台。\n\n· Tally / Boardroom：作为实用程序的治理仪表板。\n\n官网：\n\n[https://commonwealth.im/](https://commonwealth.im/)\n\n推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/hicommonwealth](https://twitter.com/hicommonwealth)\n\nDIS:\n\n[https://discord.gg/YAMEnXR7Tw](https://discord.gg/YAMEnXR7Tw)\n\n",

{"id": "5fsF2YN2u3FoMNtQuYwlXNyhZvTuUu048EAIw7FXUtk", "title": "Introducing Block-Ops", "body": "Over the last few years, I have noticed pain-points in the paradigm that exists between work that needs to be done and the people who can do it. From a developer’s perspective, they often spend months studying for Certifications or to score highly on a LeetCode or HackerRank test. At the same time, companies are hiring folks to source & recruit to get candidates into interviews where in-house technologists attempt to evaluate candidates’ skill set in a few hours.\n\nBlock-Ops, now released on the Kovan Testnet, is here to solve these problems by directly connecting do-ers with what needs to be done. Anyone in the world is able to create a project and **stake a bounty** within it. Similarly, everyone is able to submit their solution for a project. **All of these Projects and Submissions** are **standard ERC-721 NFTs** and payments are handled via decentralized smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\n## Why Block-Ops?\n\n### Project Managers\n\nThe traditional hiring method of sourcing, recruiting, & interviewing candidates is a long and costly process, and even once completed, you entrust a single developer to provide a solution to a problem you have now. By utilizing Block-Ops, **you directly engage the entire world of developers to solve your problem**, circumventing the recruiting process altogether. Best of all, if on the odd chance your project cannot be completed, you are **free to pull your funds out at any time!**\n\n**This gives you the benefits of open-sourcing your code, without needing to open-source your code.**\n\n### Developers\n\nWe have designed our smart contracts as ERC-721 NFTs that **double as decentralized escrow** accounts. Upon creation of a contract, the creator (Project Manager) stores a bounty inside the NFT and upon completion of work, the **developer can redeem these funds as payment**.\n\nAlongside the monetary incentive, the NFT serves as a *proof-of-work* done that the developer will carry with them forever. This can be displayed on a resume, social media profile, and even on Block-Ops!\n\n## Data Storage\n\nWe utilize both IPFS and Filecoin to store all Projects and Submissions, meaning you will never need to worry about accidentally misplacing or even deleting old code. Upon either Project Creation or Solution submission, the associated metadata and images are uploaded to IPFS then Filecoin. Once uploaded, you will be able to see your NFT in your Wallet. Check out our guide on adding the BlockOps NFT to your Web3 Wallet: \n\n[https://block-ops.xyz/info](https://block-ops.xyz/info)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n### BlockOpsDao\n\nThe next thing we will begin working on is formalizing a DAO which will be regulated via our Block-Ops Token. The DAO itself will be responsible for setting and distributing platform fees to improve the Block-Ops service and create partnerships with other DAO's.\n\nA fault in the insurance paradigm, especially in the United States, is benefits being tied to your employer. While Block-Ops directly solves the need for employment in terms of take-home-pay, it does not yet solve the insurance issue. That is why we are exploring a partnership with Opolis, a fantastic project that provides benefits to workers in the Web3 community such as:\n\n1. Health, Vision, & Dental Insurance\n2. FSA & HSA\n3. Group 401(k), Solo 401(k), and IRA options\n\n[https://opolis.co/](https://opolis.co/)\n\n### Zero-Knowledge Proofs & Optimistic Rollups\n\nIf there is one thing we can take away from the madness of NFT Summer, it’s that the Ethereum blockchain is not yet ready to handle hundreds of millions of concurrent users. While we always plan to use Ethereum as our settlement layer, we are exploring various ZK solutions such as [zkSync v2](https://v2.zksync.io/) and Optimistic Rollups like [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) or [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) so that we can continue delivering the Block-Ops platform with even lower fees. \n\n### Community Support Channel\n\nOnce we go live with the BlockOpsDao, we will create a managed Discord Server that will authenticate based on you having our governance token. This channel will be a fantastic home for collaboration between Developers and Project Managers. We will also use this channel to brainstorm ideas of how we can give back to the community. Some ideas we are already considering are an IRL Meet Up (with a virtual option), developing a dividend-paying NFT treasury, and helping cover the fees associated with a benefits provider like [Opolis.co](https://opolis.co/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDon’t forget to check out our website [https://block-ops.xyz](https://block-ops.xyz/) and [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/dao_block?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for the latest information on the project.

Metaverse Ape leads a new paradigm revolution in the Web 3.0 Metaverse", "body": "With the Metaverse boom, the value of the NFT market has risen, and the industry even once expected that the NFT market size will exceed 100 billion dollars. But the ensuing chaos of hype and plagiarism, reckless price hikes, and siphoning off investments is intensifying, causing people to take a fresh look. Before NFT step into the next stage of development, ecological aggregation NFT rolled, Metaverse Ape lead the Web 3.0 Metaverse new paradigm revolution, to promote NFT really back to the technical level to give positive support to the digital world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wPuWx16RdPArqMa50EuDS.png?height=720&width=720)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6KfbvRFrACV8GDH76rU5N.png?height=720&width=720)\n\n**Inner adjustment after NFT’s wealth creation spree**\n\nThe year of 2021 is the well-deserved year of the NFT for many people. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet NFT sold for $2.9 million. Artist Beeple’s NFT sold for a whopping $69 million. Bored Ape, crypto-punk and other headline projects swept the market. Christie’s, Sotheby’s and other top auction houses have entered the NFT auction. The NFT market has sold as much as $24.9 billion a year, and the originally niche NFT circuit has broken the circle with a market valuation of over $40 billion, attracting tens of millions of ordinary people to start the road to “gold”.\n\nUp to April 2022, 16 listed companies have launched their own digital collectibles trading platforms. The addition of celebrities has helped, from American rapper Eminem to NBA superstar Steph Curry, all of whom are owners of NFT.\n\nAs a branch of the current hot Metaverse, NFT is a virtual space parallel to and independent of the real world, with an additional layer of uniqueness, immutability, and corroboration based on the original meaning of the Metaverse. But is this really the case?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N8jB7RAEw6YeBQSzM68FJ.png?height=580&width=1280)\n\nAs fierce as the tide of NFT has turned, the controversy it has suffered has come as quickly as it has come. The famous collection of the NFT session mentioned earlier — the first tweet NFT by the founder of Twitter — has received the highest offer of no more than $10,000 today. After a year, the price difference is thousands of times. Not only that, the NFT market has also frequently fallen into the criticism of speculation and plagiarism, insider trading and other chaos, the chaos of the industry is staggering.\n\nIn the insecure background, the cooling of the NFT market may not be a bad thing, or at least give NFT the opportunity to correct and reflect. The tide is fading, and the ecological aggregation of NFT rolls in. Metaverse Ape leads the new paradigm revolution in the Web 3.0 Metaverse, and unremittingly pushes NFT to truly return to the technical level to give positive support to the digital world.\n\n**Ecological aggregation NFT is coming: Metaverse Ape incubates Web3.0 eco-applications**\n\nTo create an ecological universe around the Metaverse Ape community, the Metaverse Ape ecological universe NFT aggregation ecological platform will soon be available, incubating sub ecological projects such as MAPE and SAPE around the Metaverse, NFT, games, virtual worlds and future technologies, covering the landed ecological applications in various fields such as Metaverse chain tour, NFT, DeFi, SocialFi and GameFi.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/swbDpeI-DpGFlVV-e92bR.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\nThe first mission of Metaverse Ape is to become a platform for aggregating NFT, DeFi, SocialFi, GameFi and other landed ecological applications in various fields in the Web3 era; the second mission is to incubate Web3.0 ecological Metaverse, NFT, games and other application projects, and become a bridge between users, players and projects; the ultimate mission is to create an ecological universe of Metaverse Ape that aggregates project parties, users, investors and communities. The ultimate mission of Metaverse Ape is to create an ecological universe of the ape community that brings together project owners, users, investors and communities.\n\nAfter defining the Web 3.0 Metaverse and opening a new paradigm, Metaverse Ape creates a more democratic and open decentralized Metaverse ecological application platform based on distributed technologies such as blockchain and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) in order to create a decentralized Internet universe ecology. The Metaverse Ape platform is centered on user experience through blockchain. The Metaverse Ape platform is centered on user experience, changing the world, redefining value and earning revenue through blockchain, Web 3.0 and Metaverse ecological products, creating an on-chain economic system with games, lending and management in one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pn7CEK90h3O2Cjs9l9S-I.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\n**Redefining Web 3.0: Metaverse Ape opens up a new paradigm of referential portfolio play**\n\nGaming powered by blockchain provides a new economic dimension to the gaming experience. Metaverse Ape combines DeFi, NFT and gaming experience to realize the vision of decentralized Web 3.0, where all users can benefit from the growth of the network.\n\nBased on that, Metaverse Ape provides Web 3.0 era ecological strategy to create diversified Web 3.0 products. Based on various consensus and mutual benefit mechanisms, through decentralization and DAO form, Metaverse Ape aims to provide global Web 3.0 users, investors, developers, and project parties with deep aggregation and links to create coexistence and co-prosperity, mutual benefit and win-win Web 3 universe game ecology.\n\nThe reason why Metaverse Ape has risen to prominence is that it embodies the self-cultivation of the underlying NFT in the form of a Metaverse worldview. In other words, based on Metaverse Ape other NFT and GameFi projects can build countless different worldviews, which is the power of the new paradigm of Web3.0 + Metaverse “referential combination” play.\n\nTraditional DeFi Lego blocks have made everyone aware of the power of composability, but they are owned combinations, which means you have to own a block in order to use it to build a superstructure. In liquidity mining, for example, participants must own and pledge some sort of liquidity credential before they can participate in mining.\n\nMetaverse Ape provides a new paradigm of Web3.0 + Metaverse “ referential combination” on this basis. You only need to stand on the shoulders of giants to aggregate the landed ecological applications in various fields such as NFT, DeFi, SocialFi, GameFi, etc., and then propose your own new solutions. Then go to incubate Web3.0 ecological Metaverse, NFT, games and other application projects, you can save a lot of useless work of repeatedly building wheels. Eventually, the ecological universe of Metaverse Ape, which is built by free combination, has naturally gathered many project parties, users, investors and communities who uphold the belief of NFT.\n\nOf course, Metaverse Ape has just come out, and there are uncertainties in its development, and it remains to be seen whether it can really change the mainstream virtual economy paradigm in a positive way.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l7UpDpnqIjZoqL01OjR2r.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\n# Contact Us\n\n**Twitter：**<https://twitter.com/MetaverseApe_> \n **Medium：**<https://medium.com/@MetaverseApe_> \n **Telegram:** <https://t.me/mataverseswap>** \n Mirror：**<https://mirror.xyz/metaverseape>", "timestamp": 1654776850, "digest": "YCRyvFd-JMYpykI8rKjrZdqHdD3tWkboL68ZZKv6eP8", "contributor": "0x8841Bc394ce1A122cF2faB1FcF20AB102163A291"}

", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l4XxaWTZnvIdVjd3-eS26.png?height=960&width=1920)\n\n### Ilya Zhurin, OG Protocol business development lead, answers this question.\n\n## Dynamic NFTs in p2e games\n\nDynamic NFTs enable blockchain games to do more with their digital game assets. They allow users to experience a more realistic game flow, as NFTs evolve based on players' actions and respond to their progress. As a result, the gameplay feels more real, and players stay excited about coming back to play more and seeing their achievements reflected in their NFTs.\n\nI believe that games with strong in-game economies can really do well to adopt dynamic NFTs. Also, with the right dynamic logic baked in the NFTs, interest in the secondary market can be high, leading to higher volume and royalties.\n\n## Ideas on how to use dynamic NFT for p2e\n\nAll kinds of events may trigger the change of NFTs — currency rates, NFT price, users’ addresses, balances, in-app events, weather, sports news… Your imagination is the only limit. Here just some examples of how you can use this technology in p2e games:\n\n● Standard avatars evolve into mages, warriors, or miners after several in-game quests. Their appearance and stats change, giving each type certain advantages over others;\n\n● fighters get scars and bruises after a certain number of PVP fights;\n\n● swords and armor start shining with green light after enchanting;\n\n● avatars' faces turn sad when ETH drops below $2000;\n\n● rainy weather in real life reduces car speed in a racing game.\n\n## Web3 current market state\n\nThe play-to-earn market is quite saturated, as many gaming projects compete for players' attention. Generous giveaways proved only to be a temporary solution for onboarding players, as they attract people who come for the money, not for the game. Such players leave for the next shiny thing as soon as in-game rewards dry up.\n\nFor a game to be successful in the long term, it should be interesting to play even without the rewards, though building such a game is challenging. This is why I believe that in the future we will see a lot of partnerships between Web2 gaming studios and Web3 projects. Teams that have both game-building and blockchain experience will have good chances to survive and thrive.\n\nI also see more games trying to deliver interactive game-like interfaces even before the game is ready, giving users something to do with their digital assets, in turn keeping their audience engaged.\n\n## How will the OG Protocol help p2e game developers solve their problems?\n\nGame builders are looking for ways to boost user engagement and retention, as well as onboarding new users, and dynamic NFTs are a great way to achieve these goals. However, this is a relatively new technology, so the implementation may be challenging. Game development teams would need to hire additional developers and invest time and resources in implementation and ongoing support.\n\nOur team has over 4 years and several dynamic NFT projects in our portfolio. So, we decided to start [OG Protocol](https://www.ogprotocol.com/) to enable web3 teams to achieve their business goals by helping them integrate 3D dynamic NFTs and ensuring smooth and hassle-free ongoing support of dynamic changes in their NFTs. With [OG Protocol](https://www.ogprotocol.com/) it can be done more efficiently compared to in-house support.\n\n## The future of p2e games\n\nI believe that in the near future more blockchain games will take advantage of dynamic NFTs. We're still in a very early stage and the awareness is relatively low. Some games are implementing dynamic NFTs already, and I see this trend picking up speed in the next 6-12 months. Evolving NFTs will bring blockchain gaming to the next level of interactivity, blurring the borders between games and life.\n\n👉 For more info, join our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/+4ur2djAAEX4yOTQy)", "timestamp": 1654777173, "digest": "PfoBpbFSjnuQ4CTAB8M_ugY7PPWO6KRaLOtwaHknfBw", "contributor": "0x866341601af12c2433b073Ca66d34d8Ba6Bc5d58"}

Judging from the current situation, the investment scale of encrypted investment institutions in chain games next only to public chain infrastructure.\n\nA16z, Paradigm, Three Arrows Capital (Three Arrows Capital), Binance Labs and FTX (Alameda Research), the top crypto investment institutions we are familiar with that have all deployed some AAA chain games. In addition, Animoca Brands, a game development company, has also frequently appears in the list of investment institutions for chain game projects.\n\nFor example, A16z deployed Forte, Dapper Labs, Yuga Labs & Improbable, and Sky Mavis chain game teams, Paradigm deployed Sky Mavis and Parallel. Three Arrows Capital deployed Ultiverse and Ascenders, and Binance Labs deployed Sky Mavis And Ultiverse. FTX (Alameda Research) laid out Yuga Labs, Big Time and Star Atlas.\n\n![A](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8VNgucnko2leMCluSLtpk.jpg?height=2880&width=3840)\n\n**Analysis purpose**\n\nAfter participating in many blockchain games in the market, I found that most of them are so-called \"mining games\", which only have the speculative attributes of drumming and passing flowers, and there is no real in-depth game experience.\n\nEternal World is the first 3A Xianxia metaverse game I found in the world. Since many capitals are laying out the chain game track, I will use the whole article to analyze Eternal World to see if it can be grasped in 2022, a hundredfold return, and open dual channels of entertainment and wealth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qvaPe6KAoVx8SQKXmk812.jpg?height=1158&width=1697)\n\nBefore that, sprite also read a lot of bloggers' interpretations of web2 and web3 games. Many people will take the well-known King Glory as an example. King Glory players belong to consumption and pay to Tencent, but the money cannot be returned. In the eyes of people in the currency circle, there is no gold farming effect. But why does the King Glory live so well? The answer given by many bloggers is that it is fun and can bring spiritual enjoyment to people. I agree with this.\n\nNext, these bloggers continued to give examples. If there is a 100% nano-replica web3 version of the King Glory, the gameplay is exactly the same as the glory of the king of web2, then now you spend 1,000 RMB to buy the skin, the skin first belongs to you, and then you can also slowly get pay back while playing. Most of this money is not given to Tencent, but is taken from players and used for players. So which would you choose?\n\nThe conclusion given by the bloggers is that everyone will prefer the Glory of the King of web3\n\nBut sprite don’t think so. At first glance, there is nothing wrong with it, but if you think about it carefully, you will find that there are many paradoxes in it.\n\nI think it's more like a plate. People put money in first, and then get it back little by little over time. Even after getting the principal back, you can get more profits.\n\nIsn't this the obvious plate play? The predecessors make money from the later players. Is this the so-called take from the players and use it for the players? Why don't the predecessors build the bridge, and the latter pay the bill?\n\nI think everyone once defined the web3 game, don't forget the success of web2, there is its inevitability, we should not completely ignore the properties of web2 while thinking about web3\n\nSo what do I think a successful web3 game should look like?\n\nThere must be levels, and there must be big brothers! The big brother is the main consumer in the game. The charge money strength of the big brother in traditional games is beyond people's imagination. It does not mean that the big brother is a fat sheep, and the investment cannot be recovered. It's the big brother in the game, who usually buys time, efficiency, and sense of achievement with money.\n\nThey don't plan carefully, and how to operate will return the money faster. For the big brother in the game, they enjoy the pleasure of paying for the bill. The same time invested in the game to calculate the income, it is better to put it into their business and there will be a faster return. So big brother is here to buy pleasure with money\n\nLast year, many chain games targeted those bosses and asked them to invest millions and tens of millions, claiming that they would pay back their money in a few days. That is pure nonsense. Will the real rich believe it? As a result, it collapsed, and some big brothers made money. Whose money did they make?\n\nA big brother of who has millions of money may cut hundreds of ordinary players, or it may be another big brother. So we must return to human nature. The real big brother's position in the game is the consumer, and this is not the battlefield for them to make money. They come to the game to spend money to save time, improve efficiency and get pleasure! Don't listen to that nonsense that the more you invest, the more you get paid.\n\nSo why is there less and less big brother in web2 games now? Is the big brother unwilling to play games, or is the big brother old and no energy to play?\n\nActually no, games are an excellent field of spiritual pastime for modern people. With the opening of powerful social attributes, games have no age span. They are not children's play as we understand them. They have become the entry of major international capital running the track.\n\nSo does it mean that the current economic environment is poor, and the big brothers have no money? In fact, believe that sentence, the rich may have no money one day, but there will never be a shortage of rich people in this world. In fact, the real reason why the big brother is reluctant to continue playing the game is actually that he has less companionship. Big brother himself is in the game, there is no social interaction, no competition, no sense of honor, and naturally no desire to consume. Why is this?\n\nBecause a really fun game is often heavily involved, like the legends of web2, Paradise, and World of Warcraft in the past. Everyone needs to be immersed in games for a long time, but with the increasing pressure of life and the rapid development of the Internet era, in addition to games, other entertainment and pastimes have been born. For example, live broadcast is the most typical example. Now many people choose to watch live broadcast for spiritual entertainment in their free time. It may be easier to lie down and get pleasure than playing games.\n\nSo having said that, do we have a little inspiration? Why do games urgently switch from web2 to web3? Did the game project party Conscience discover it? Give back tens of millions of dollars in revenue to players every year?\n\nNONONO, the cake of capital will not be easily cut out, they are more vicious than we imagined. The reason why we anxiously switch to WEB3 is because traditional web2 games cannot survive! The reason is that there is no accompany to play, anyway, they are not making money, there are too many channels for entertainment, no one wants to immerse in the game to get the pleasure.\n\nSo how do you get the player back into the game, money! Let's make money! Money is omnipotent, and money is the biggest driving force of people. Only by allowing us to truly earn money while playing games is the real web3 game.\n\nIn fact, here, everyone also understands that we ordinary people have a hidden identity in web3 games, that is, the accompany of the big brother. We play with it more, activate social interaction, increase game competition, and create a complete ecology with strong interaction and competition system, so that the big brother is naturally willing to consume. Taking the scene of the live broadcast room as an example, what kind of live broadcast room has a big brother spending, often with a large audience and a lot of interaction, whether you brush gifts or not, there are always people chatting and interacting with rhythm on the public screen, which will naturally attract big brothers to brush the list.\n\nThe open gang function of the game is a very good social means. The competition between gangs and gangs is accompanied by promotion of physique within the gang, allowing more ordinary players to form a group to make money. At the same time, I don't worry about the big brothers holding a group. It sounds ugly. Only the poor talk about holding a group. The rich are all competitive.\n\nJust like in the live broadcast room, those spectators with a low wealth level are the easiest to form a group. Everyone also doesn’t buy gifts, and no one looks down on anyone. Let’s find a way to let the anchor give everyone more benefits, and stimulate the big brother to go to the anchor’s consumption. Reward, this virtually completes a closed loop. The anchor sings and dances to benefit ordinary players, and ordinary players tout the big brother and stimulate the big brother to spend on the anchor.\n\nIn this closed loop, each character gets what he wants. Among them, who is the most important? Some people say that the big brother is the most important, wrong! The most important one is the anchor. The anchor must have talent, so that ordinary players will be optimistic about your potential stock. The interaction of ordinary players with your likes is an investment. Who says we don’t invest without spending money? Our time and energy are all invested, and it is also about the cost of being a foil! When an anchor has information, there are players watching, such a live broadcast room will naturally attract big brothers\n\nTherefore, in web3 games, the core is the game, and the target of the game is the anchor of the live broadcast room! Whether it is fun or not, and whether the design is reasonable or not, is the key to whether it can attract players.\n\nWe ordinary players are optimistic that your game is fun, and I believe that there will be more big brothers to consume, so we play it, so that we can make money.\n\nSo a good WEB3 game, I think it should have the following points\n\n1. The core is to make the game playable, and then design a good economic model\n2. Be friendly to us ordinary players, take care of us, and regard us as the core wealth of the game. We will naturally stimulate a lot of krypton gold players while playing and earning.\n3. How to realize the consumption of big brother, this does not need to be explained too much, the game is the mapping of society, as long as there are people, there will be competition, where there is society, there will be people who want to have the right to speak, and more people will be born who are eager to make rules. The makers of the game, all these rights require competition, money is the only way to compete in the game, there is no need to worry about no big brother consumption\n   Based on the points I have summarized above, I will now introduce this Eternal World in detail. It is what I have found so far, and it is the most representative work of web3 games in my heart. It has natural game attributes and a complete economic model. I have already seen web3 games.

It is a creation token and can be pledged for mining.The total number of NFTs issued is 300,000, and the team retains 20%\n\nSynthesis requires 2 NFTs of the same level to synthesize, and the synthesis rate of different levels is different. A failure to synthesize destroys an NFT, which creates a massive deflation. The higher the level of NFT, the lower the probability of synthesis, but at the same time the benefits will be super amplified\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VuTRdZbS-gJO8NpAemP8k.png?height=551&width=987)\n\nLevel 1 and Level 2 NFTs can get in-game airdrop blind boxes and game consumption spirit stones\n\nNFTs above level 3 can not only get in-game airdrop blind boxes, but also pledge mining tokens. A total of 15% of the tokens can be obtained through NFT pledge. The higher the level of NFT, the more tokens obtained by pledge.\n\nIn addition to obtaining pledge tokens, level 5 NFTs also have exclusive monster spawning maps in the game scene. I think this gameplay is very novel and user-friendly. It has both the randomness of NFT blind box opening and the multi-functional properties of synthesis.\n\nPlayers who have been drawn to Level 1 and Level 2 NFTs in this way, if they do not want to enter the game to play, can also synthesize Level 3 NFTs to pledge and mine tokens. The highest-level 5-level NFT can only be obtained through synthesis, which will keep the floor price of low-level NFTs rising.\n\nThe selling price of the blind box is only 10U, allowing more players to lower the threshold to participate. At the same time, the number of Level 5 NFTs is limited. When Level 5 NFTs have been synthesized and saturated, players can only buy from each other in the secondary market.\n\n而下面的氪金遊戲玩家，如果想進入專屬地圖PK爭奪裝備，只能從前期有NFT的持有者那裡購買。買。這真正讓傳統遊戲玩家學會了區塊鏈操作，也讓玩家手中的 NFT 在區塊鏈中獲得了更有價值的支持。這種股權 NFT 真的很值錢\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VPWHGx8Hxsn-I97LVy4JA.jpg?height=1158&width=1697)\n\nSprite 真的是這樣的 NFT 是認為值得參與和擁有的，無論從炒作價值還是長期持有和權益的角度來看。\n\n打造出今年第一款好俠客為主題的3A大作，是海外玩家世界獨一無二的獨特風格。的大型連鎖遊戲。NFT強烈推薦參與。項目方不為自己保留代幣。選擇持有NFT一起上線，是為了讓遊戲能夠長久地做下去。NFT是質押獲取代幣，還是市場更新，都有非常大的增值空間。交易是可以充滿高回報的優質項目，千萬不能錯過！   ", "timestamp": 1654777823, "digest": "kFh2llgpSeMY8kZg2xoM7iVcdBRrIPdpvFwWy5glfOE", "contributor": "0xEC27046f6E96Ac0aE339F83fb2Fc1eFBf18eCa29"}

{"id": "bG3GHPAocfQB9-KzxSgy1oJ9sKuWt6RmsRgSyWpLVGQ", "title": "Build blockchain warehouse with Datawaves ETL", "body": "Nowadays, Web3 startup teams have increasingly complex needs for handling blockchain data and are no longer satisfied with just building dashboards. For example, build machine learning models to serve prediction or recommendation scenarios, run graph analysis algorithms to find abnormal transaction addresses, or provide metrics data for upper-layer business. Whichever of the above methods means one must build a blockchain warehouse based on on-chain data.\n\nBut building a stable, easy-to-use blockchain warehouse is no easy task. `ethereum-etl` and `ethereum-etl-airflow` are two excellent open-source projects. Users can get full volume data directly through `ethereum-etl` and build a pipeline of T+1 data through `ethereum-etl-airflow`. However, having them alone is just half of the story.\n\n## Build blockchain warehouse with open-source components\n\n![Build Ethereum data warehouses with open-source ecosystems](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J75NZMyNBNm4Kq5z1fchB.png?height=1152&width=2795)\n\nThis is a complete data processing pipeline:\n\n* The user first needs an EVM node with all-history data and access to trace data (which is expensive)\n* The data is then regularly synchronized to the data warehouse via `ethereum-etl-airflow` and subsequently decodes contracts.\n  * `ethereum-etl-airflow` is an excellent library for most data extract and transformation needs. Still, one huge problem is that it is bound to the compute engine and currently only fully supports BigQuery requirements. So if you're not using Google Cloud, you'll need to re-implement the operator and contract decode logic.\n  * Once the number of contract events/functions that need to be decoded rises to a certain level, it's not easy to keep these tasks scheduled and completed on time. Usually, the pipeline maintainer needs to have sufficient experience in Airflow and Kubernetes.\n* Finally, the user will need to have another transform project to translate the activities emitted by the smart contract and model the upper-level business logic.\n\n## Build blockchain warehouse with Datawaves ETL\n\n![Build Ethereum data warehouses with Datawaves ETL](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3eJK2hfYeI4_QbDpplg77.png?height=1296&width=2913)\n\nWe are building **[Datawaves ETL](https://datawaves.xyz/etl)**, which integrates multiple standardized components to provide the ability to automatically synchronize data into the user's data warehouse, providing directly:\n\n* EVM raw data (e.g., `transactions`, `traces`, `logs`, etc.)\n* decoded contract data (e.g. `erc721_evt_transfer`, `opensea_WyvernExchangeV2_call_atomicMatch_` etc.)\n\nThe user only needs to provide the data warehouse connection URL, and cloud file system (e.g., AWS S3) configuration. And then, the cloud server can directly access and transform the data needed by the user into the user's data warehouse or s3 bucket daily and create tables in the data warehouse. It has the following advantages:\n\n* You don't need to buy a node with all history and access to traces data (in QuickNode, this costs $500+/month)\n* Extract the total amount of raw data very quickly at a meager cost (in QuickNode, it would be close to $2000+, with a higher machine cost to achieve a similar speed to ours)\n  * QuickNode charges for the number of requests after the exceeded plan, and there is no batch extracting of traces in the EVM Node interface, so this data is costly to extract.\n  * Because we already have data compressed using columnar storage, the block file is smaller and has fewer files to be transferred faster.\n* Eliminating the need to maintain the underlying data ETL pipeline, which is standardized and tedious, leaving this to a cloud service that devotes more resources to work on the data movement and smart contract decoding, so your team can deliver business insights faster.\n* The Airflow that schedules these tasks is cumbersome to maintain, and the more contracts that need to be decoded, the more tasks there are for the entire Airflow. Keeping an Airflow on the Kubernetes cluster with thousands of tasks running can also be a pain.\n* Save the type design and namespace design work. We found many types of accuracy issues in building our data warehouse. These experiences are packaged in a complete solution for the user to use, and the user gets clean data that is the easiest to use in its data warehouse.\n* Execution speed is essential in contract decoding. When there are thousands of events/functions to decode every day, it is not easy to ensure that the data is ready before the user uses it. Saving time in developing automated contract decoding tools, in the solution, we provide automated contract decoding tools that are 100 times faster than libraries like `web3.py`.\n  * We have rewritten the entire decoding process in Java in the Spark engine, enabling a speedup of hundreds of times over the python implementation in high concurrency scenarios.\n\nIf you’d like to play with Datawaves ETL, join our [waitlist](https://forms.gle/PSKJApvsjAvetA1r6), and ask any questions in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/22sQjRuYHR).", "timestamp": 1654778089, "digest": "0Cj52zUB5vq6gLozKtherX2pw0zVKs4Vl35H3KIUk-U", "contributor": "0xc4f2B3EF79bF0e83cD980427bC5A89Db14787f1E"}

This token is tradeable on SushiSwap for Ethereum. The Vault tracks the floor value of Pixlton, which allows people who are looking to sell their Pixltonians to always be able to sell at floor price into The Vault. Because other NFT collectors can also buy from The Vault, this creates a liquidity pool that is always able to give you the floor value for your Pixltonians right then and there as opposed to listing them on OpenSea and having to wait for a buyer.\n\nYou can find our Vault here: <https://nftx.io/vault/0xf8eb56c7e4e3c885c905a19583bf41644d35aa0a/info/>\n\n## Buying Pixltonians from The Vault\n\nTo buy Pixltonians from The Vault you will first need some ETH. After visiting our Vault using the URL above you can pick any Pixltonian you’d like to have. Buying from The Vault also incurs a slight fee. There are two ways you can buy from The Vault: — Random redeem (1% fee, NFTX decides at random which Pixl you will get) — Targeted redeem (5% fee, You decide which Pixltonian you want at a slight premium)\n\nIf you want to do a random redeem, you can hit the “Redeem” in the dialog on the right side of the screen and indicate how many Pixltonians you want to buy. By subsequently hitting “Redeem” you will broadcast the transaction to the blockchain and once approved you will be the proud owner of a random Pixltonian. Randomly redeeming requires PIXLS token, which can be bought on Sushiswap using the dialog presented to you when redeeming.\n\nIf you want to do a targeted buy, simply click the Pixltonian you want to buy, click it so it becomes selected, and click “Buy Now”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v4L4ArrvkDGr4CNl-2euq.png?height=239&width=700)\n\n## Selling your Pixltonians into the Vault\n\nTo sell your Pixltonians into The Vault, you will need to go to the “Sell” tab. Choose one or more Pixlton NFTs and choose the “Sell Now” option. You may need to approve your Pixltonian for spending first. The dialog on the right will tell you how many ETH you will receive when selling into the vault. After hitting “Approve” in your Metamask, the transaction will be broadcasted and once it’s approved on the blockchain your Pixltonian will be sold into The Vault. *This means they are no longer yours and others can start to buy them from The Vault.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XYkUmUGaA2kdcO5rzG0Lp.png?height=259&width=700)\n\n## Staking your Pixltonians\n\nAlternatively, you can also stake NFTX’s PIXLS token for rewards. When looking at the Vault choose the “Stake” tab to immediately stake your Pixltonians into the pool. By staking them you get rewarded in PIXLS token, which will allow you to redeem Pixlton NFTs from The Vault. Staking does **NOT** incur a fee as it supports the ecosystem around The Vault. Staking your Pixltonians **DOES** mean that you’re essentially selling it off in favor of the PIXLS token.

Choose one or more Pixlton NFTs and choose the “Sell Now” option. You may need to approve your Pixltonian for spending first. The dialog on the right will tell you how many ETH you will receive when selling into the vault. After hitting “Approve” in your Metamask, the transaction will be broadcasted and once it’s approved on the blockchain your Pixltonian will be sold into The Vault. *This means they are no longer yours and others can start to buy them from The Vault.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XYkUmUGaA2kdcO5rzG0Lp.png?height=259&width=700)\n\n## Staking your Pixltonians\n\nAlternatively, you can also stake NFTX’s PIXLS token for rewards. When looking at the Vault choose the “Stake” tab to immediately stake your Pixltonians into the pool. By staking them you get rewarded in PIXLS token, which will allow you to redeem Pixlton NFTs from The Vault. Staking does **NOT** incur a fee as it supports the ecosystem around The Vault. Staking your Pixltonians **DOES** mean that you’re essentially selling it off in favor of the PIXLS token. Others will be able to buy your staked Pixlton NFTs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fXDZleAl4-Ewmfqtl0qou.png?height=247&width=700)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654778237, "digest": "OYgDABIQ5NzJPRfcFEgkOvb5zlg_yAuR5KZh4Y-JdIo", "contributor": "0x0f00Daec0d940C4f46F4869372d05FE4004027Cd"}

Due to their square size, they fit just fine as a PFP, but being full body makes them less than optimal for that. In the past, we’ve released our *“now suited for avatar”* variations of all of our Pixltonians but that was still kind of limited to what we had created. To finally scratch that PFP itch, we’re now releasing the Pixlton Identity Creator (PIC)!\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe PIC is a [new tool on our website](https://getpixls.com/pic) that allows you to connect to your wallet and create custom banners and avatars out of your Pixltonians. Simply drag one or more of your favorite citizens onto the canvas, select a background, and export the image. We currently support:\n\n* Avatar format (square 1:1)\n* Banner format (landscape 3:1)\n\nBoth should be perfectly suitable for Twitter and most other socials! The PIC comes with a few pre-determined backgrounds, created by all kinds of different artists. Some of them have even been graciously provided by other projects such as **Animetas** and Bitlectro’s **Dreamers**. Big thanks to them for being willing to do so!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e-K6K6-Hg-WlnmP0JQp5-.png?height=233&width=700)\n\nCurrently, the PIC supports the Genesis Pixls collection, but once we release the Pixlton Car Club we’ll be sure to integrate the cars too. That way you can show off your Pixltonians and their rides all in one awesome banner!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kOF00FuWoqC2f4gMzv3JG.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n## Get started today!\n\nCreate your own cool avatars and banners and show them off, today! Feel free to tag us on Twitter when you show off your creations and we’ll be happy to RT them. Happy tinkering!", "timestamp": 1654778365, "digest": "wedCVrlrwzmzwOiu896GzNydEDRiXh9PmgOHZVhE0Ps", "contributor": "0x0f00Daec0d940C4f46F4869372d05FE4004027Cd"}

社区经理 Lana 详细介绍了 Across V2 发布的所有阶段，包括迁移、发布、进展情况（+ 统计数据）等等。*\n\n5 月对于 Across Protocol 来说是一个非常忙碌的时期。我们一直在为我们的 V2 发布做准备！\n\n一系列活动的顺序计划如下：\n\n🐦 宣布 V2 流动性迁移\n\n📣 宣布 V2 功能\n\n🔓 开放迁移\n\n🎉 发布日派对！\n\n🚀 推出 V2\n\n🗣️ 跟进 Spaces 活动\n\n**系好安全带 — — 让我们回顾一下。**\n\n🐦 宣布 V2 流动性迁移\n\n作为一个团队，我们努力在各方面使 Across 尽可能易于使用。例如：我们简单的 UI界面、透明的费用展示和深入介绍V2的 Medium 文章这些都可以体现（这里仅举几例）。Across V2 迁移也不例外。\n\n[我们在发布前 2 周发布了一篇关于如何迁移的文章](https://medium.com/across-protocol/lps-migrate-liquidity-from-v1-to-v2-screenshots-and-faqs-8616150b3396)。这使我们能够回答有关为什么需要迁移以及如何进行迁移的任何问题，并确保我们在重要的日子之前拥有尽可能多的曝光率。\n\n我们的设计负责人甚至制作了倒计时图片来不断提醒大家，〜很有风格。〜\n\n[https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol/status/1526634917769232385/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526634917769232385%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Facrossprotocol%2Fstatus%2F1526634917769232385image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07](https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol/status/1526634917769232385/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526634917769232385%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Facrossprotocol%2Fstatus%2F1526634917769232385image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\n这些一系列的准备工作使我们能够在 Across 上获得最大的可见性，以确保人们在发布前一天打开该窗口时就会意识到并准备好迁移。\n\n📣 宣布 V2 功能\n\n5 月 18 日，我们宣布了 V2 的功能。我们让我们敏锐的高级工程师 John 和大胆的数据科学家 Chase 仔细研究了发布的每一个元素。\n\n请参阅下面的Spaces摘要,由我的（美丽且自定义编辑的）冒险时间讲述:\n\n如果您想完整收听 Spaces

0.001 ETH 的gas费和桥接费用。\n\n[https://twitter.com/jdshutt/status/1529123127149531137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1529123127149531137%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjdshutt%2Fstatus%2F1529123127149531137image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07](https://twitter.com/jdshutt/status/1529123127149531137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1529123127149531137%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjdshutt%2Fstatus%2F1529123127149531137image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\n**…支持一个新的链，polygon**\n\n现在可以使用 [Across V2 与Polygon 进行往返桥接传输](https://across.to/)。\n\n**…具有难以置信的资本效率**\n\nAcross V2 使用许多不同的机制来确保它具有令人难以置信的资本效率。通过使用净额、“及时”流动性、批处理/捆绑和我们的中心辐射模型，我们能够实现高资本效率，您会在使用 Across 时注意到增加的功能。\n\n您可以在此处阅读有关我们[提高资本效率的更多信息](https://medium.com/across-protocol/a-sneak-peek-into-across-v2-2b4d0bd95b97)。\n\n**… 支持部分资金池**\n\n在 Across V2
