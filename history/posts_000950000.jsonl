{"id": "e7md4j2spWHe9QSMxdfcceIXg1ncR4xHv1CrNhjHzzI", "title": "In Process with Strange Cintia ", "body": "[edition://0x8D9cA6754c684B7B6fF8c61cEb2fC44F5F34Ec57?editionId=0](edition://0x8D9cA6754c684B7B6fF8c61cEb2fC44F5F34Ec57?editionId=0)\n\nI, JL Maxcy, am the type of person to leave early for every appointment. I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654767872, "digest": "ATd6GGBT-Yk3YjosRY1wskWnET708rQLtZL2IVaiq-E", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}

{"id": "jEPT22i-qn9muw57fPQfqkd7UpkFzefD6S_qckqqk10", "title": "In Process with Strange Cintia ", "body": "I, JL Maxcy, am the type of person to leave early for every appointment. I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654768129, "digest": "Vw9vnwc4GgSxa3VejdEWoSDu5gtZkOyUuHaaJRUqdio", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}

Where we feature inspiring interviews from up-and-coming artists, creators and NFT projects across the local and global NFT Community.\n\nWe first came across [Ee-Vee](https://twitter.com/Xcy8_), an LA based Australian NFT artist last August through the first Anime inspired NFT generative collection (7,777), [0N1FORCE](https://twitter.com/0n1Force) where Ee-Vee was voted a “Top 10 Global Finalist” for the first ever 0N1 Art Derivative Contest, as fan voted by the 0N1Force community.\n\nWe were originally captivated by Ee-Vee’s sophisticated art style when the majority of 0N1 Art derivatives submitted by the community were all using the main “[0N1Force](https://twitter.com/0n1Force)” PFP character for their Art derivative, Ee-Vee’s choice to use the smaller companion character as the main PFP art style was bold, different and this is why we believe this particular derivative art style stood out amongst the hundreds of artist submissions.\n\nA great lesson for aspiring creatives to explore a point of difference and perspective that can make you stand out and capture attention when submitting art and creating your project collections.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*w5AUeZQjuajqO3JbsY7mgg.jpeg)\n\nEe-Vee’s Oniforce derivative art submission, Top 10 finalisist as voted by the Global OniForce Community.\n\n***Hi Ee-Vee, tell us a little about yourself?***\n\nAs a creative, I often think of myself as relentless and curious. I kickstarted my career in car design : essentially, a complex and dynamic 3-dimensional artform, with very particular styling cues. Alongside this, I’ve always been fascinated by graphics and all things 2-d, and how flat images can tell complex stories. Right now, I’m fascinated by the intersection between these two worlds.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*MpHPCIpNpz65BjwbHY_7NQ.png)\n\nThe House of Tengu — An 0N1 Story — Xcy8 #0387\n\n***What are your favorite themes to explore through your art?***\n\nIn a word, storytelling. It’s all about emotion. Art can be a personal, co-creative experience when something in the viewer gets activated, when they are no longer a passive participant. They become active agents in building meaning, and make the art come alive.\n\n***How did you get started in NFTs?***\n\nI created derivative fan-art for [0n1 Force](https://twitter.com/0n1Force) which got shortlisted as a top-10 entry. The love from the community, together with the commissions and opportunities that followed, helped me feel like there was something of value I could bring to the space.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*qH2wNanEsMbzVKZo9mdSLQ.png)\n\nThe House of Tengu — An 0N1 Story — Xcy8 #4417\n\n***What is the biggest challenge you’ve faced getting into NFTs?***\n\nIt would have to be the wonderful blend of feverish excitement, uncertainty and endless FOMO and anxiety that is the hallmark of the NFT space.\n\n***How do you see NFTs changing your artistic career?***\n\nAs an artist, I see NFTs doing something unprecedented: they offer free and instant exposure to united, inclusive and welcoming communities from all around the globe. I’m wildlly excited at the thought of adding creative currency to boundary-pushing projects, and at designing collections with visual impact.\n\n***Are there any NFT lessons learned you’d like to share?***\n\nIt’s important to know your outcomes and develop sound strategies to help you make the right calls. I feel it’s important to take the time to learn where NFTs have been and where they’re headed — this will help you back the projects that are right for you. But then again, this space moves very, very fast, and you can become unbelievably lucky overnight.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*jAQMHLUfK1kb_CldrWWVrQ.png)\n\nThe House of Tengu — An 0N1 Story — Xcy8 #1379\n\n***What are you working on now?***\n\nI still loving designing cars, so that’s keeping me pumped. I’m also building out my art portfolio, with a focus on 3d pieces — there is no shortage of inspiration from new artists and projects in this space!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*844enOJyLAFyaX6jF2W-eg.png)\n\nThe House of Tengu — An 0N1 Story — Xcy8 #895\n\n***What advice would you give to artists entering the world of NFTs?***\n\nJump in, dive deep. This is a spectacular moment in history, with artistic opportunities unlike ever before.\n\nEe-vee is definitely an artist to watch in this space and we’re excited to see what future projects and collaborations are in store!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Efk-9j3b4aDZhqh_vuTs6A.png)\n\nCheck out Ee-Vee’s Social Media and NFT project links below.\n\nTwitter: @[Xcy8_](https://twitter.com/Xcy8_)\n\nOpensea:[ Xcy8 3750](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1beed1d6831cc077636a08bdc66c2f5602869198/17)\n\nOpensea: [House of Tengu, Xcy8](https://opensea.io/collection/house-of-tengu)\n\n***If you’re looking to be featured either as an artist, community builder, or NFT enthusiast please reach out to us at hello@nftsyd.io***\n\n \n \n\narticle by [@svmmerstein](https://twitter.com/svmmerstein)\n\n[crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=](crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=)\n\n \n \n\nnft syd, nft sydney , nft community , nft australia", "timestamp": 1654767850, "digest": "ZXF77fiH4YJ6DGkyVNRBT3bLdqdVf3xYsi9ifpxB5Bw", "contributor": "0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4"}

Facts need storytellers to breathe life into them, so I use photography as my vessel.\n\n***How would you define your artistic style?***\n\nBy grasping on to my fascination for our natural world I capture thought-provoking imagery that helps others see the planet as a whole. I discovered that by coming from a place of awe, I could bridge the gap between art and science to establish a compelling narrative around sustainability.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3HSOmku1LqD5XDec8HB7_g.png)\n\nAmbience (Foundation), Artist: Gabriella Morton\n\n***What’s your inspiration when creating your art?***\n\nI have a variety of unreleased work but I’ve been trying to marry them with a way to give back.

I broke 6 bones and spent 3 months in a wheelchair and became unable to continue work as a freelance photographer. The silver lining has been the gift of time to navigate this space and understand the benefits of digital ownership and the future of image licensing.\n\n***Collaborations are becoming increasingly common and popular in the NFT space. Have you done any collaborative work recently and how was that experience for you?***\n\nI think the splits feature on Foundation is so encouraging to get outside your comfort zone and double down on sharing the load. I recently made this peice with Ashton, and although we’d had it listed for months when we secured our sale I can confirm that the excitement was even better shared!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*b6cvJMlaYsYVPLp0gFwjoQ.png)\n\nIsolation (Foundation), Artist: Gabriella Morton and Ashton Lee\n\n***What is your favorite part of the NFT community?***\n\nNFT’s feel like a digital renaissance where creatives can cut the middlemen and advance passion projects to the driver’s seat. We’ve never had so much freedom for producing non-commercial work while gaining sustainable financial compensation. I can’t wait to see how the physical world utilizes smart contracts and understands the value of provenance.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6w0CdBnC8GdwVr7reb87sw.png)\n\nEthereal (Foundation), Artist: Gabriella Morton\n\n***What advice would you give to artists entering the world of NFTs?***\n\nAt this point, Twitter is a non-negotiable for marketing your NFT’s. It’s predominantly verbal and comes down to community building and networking which happens in live interactive podcasts called Twitter Spaces. It’s all extremely fast paced and ever evolving, so you first must be willing to listen and absorb. Ads and influencer marketing stick out as ingenuine, so you really need an organic, consistent, and cohesive story to build a recognizable and identifiable story.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*aeO8Q8A7BC0J896Bqtkbyg.png)\n\nSurface (Foundation), Artist: Gabriella Morton\n\n**Stay connected with Gabriella through these Social Media links**\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/gabriellamort>\n\nInstagram: <https://www.instagram.com/gabriellamorton/>\n\nFoundation: <https://foundation.app/@gabriellamorton>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*wHcMcqrp1F6tEso9dKsiqA.png)\n\n*Our aim throughout the **NFTSYD Artist Series** is to provide our community with helpful insights and practical tips to learn from emerging and established artist experiences, as you navigate through your own creative journey with Non-Fungible Tokens as a creator, collector or enthusiast.*\n\n***If you’re looking to be featured either as an artist, community builder, or NFT enthusiast please reach out to us at hello@nftsyd.io***\n\narticle by [@svmmerstein](https://twitter.com/svmmerstein)\n\n[crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=](crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=)\n\nnft syd, nft sydney , nft community , nft australia", "timestamp": 1654768067, "digest": "JMqoZaL0M9WgZv1t8Po_Lj6imod4SLIWXY3P4BCkTNw", "contributor": "0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4"}

Now my day job is in Marketing (with some photography).\n\nI fell into photography through a time of tragedy & my images represent the light I saw after the darkness of grief had me trapped for many years.\n\nI started photography in 2016 armed with an iPhone, I was on a holiday with friends in South Australia and I saw the most beautiful sunset and took a photo, something in me clicked, literally. The next day I walked for 10 hours, just shooting, I was hooked.\n\nI shot every day up to 2019 when I purchased a Nikon Z6, I started again and attended workshops and online tutorials. I’m so proud of my achievements having received 4 Honourable Mentions in the 2017 and 2019 International iPhone Photography Awards, finalist in the 2017 Busselton Jetty 30 year Celebration Photo Competition, Honourable Mention in the Australian Photographer of the year, Mobile Category in 2018 and finalist in the 2016 and 2018 Blink Photographic Awards.\n\nWith the camera I have received a Commendation in the Landscape category in the The Australian Photography Magazine Awards competition, been featured by Nikon Australia and my images used for their My Nikon Life celebrations.

My sister is 14 years older than me and so growing up I always looked up to her and knew this was something I wanted to do.\n\nAt age 13 I came across some photos from people on the edge of city building rooftops in Sydney and immediately knew it was something I wanted to do.\n\nI fell into the urban exploration subculture and it consumed my life for the following five years. I found a group of like minded individuals, and from there we figured out how to access the roofs of hotels and office buildings, and put in hours learning the entry and exit points of train tunnels. While the rest of my peers would spend their weekends partying and consuming [goon sacks](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/goon-bag) in public parks, I could be found walking on the edge of city skyscrapers and dodging speeding trains, all with a camera in hand.\n\nAll of this wasn’t without consequence — at age 16 I found myself arrested, and at 17 I broke my back whilst running from security at a building site.\n\nI’ve since quit exploring and moved onto other creative ventures, but I have lifetime’s worth of photos and memories from my teenage days.\n\n***When did you first get into NFT’s?***\n\nI started looking into doing NFTs in March of 2021, but I didn’t end up launching a [opensea collection](https://opensea.io/collection/keys-to-the-city) until October of 2021.\n\nIn all honesty I never really took my photography seriously as ‘art’. It’s not the sort of thing that is typically recognised or respected amongst the art world.\n\nHowever, I was completely inspired by fellow international explorers such as **[Driftershoots](https://www.instagram.com/driftershoots/)** and **[Tom Durante](https://www.instagram.com/tomdurante/)**[ ](https://www.instagram.com/tomdurante/)who took the leap into NFT’s and absolutely thrived. It is clear now that NFTs are a powerful means for artists who create work that falls outside the realm of the traditional gallery system.\n\n***Are you currently working on any projects or collaborations ?***\n\nI’m currently featured in an **‘[Aussie Artists Collective](https://twitter.com/AussieArtistCol)**\\*\\*’ \\*\\*online gallery amongst 68 other Australian photographers which has been cool to be a part of.\n\nWhat I’m most excited about is an upcoming project I have with my good friend **[@carlhowski](https://twitter.com/carlhowski/)**. We’re planning to hold a physical NFT gallery space here in Sydney early 2022. This is where I plan to launch my next collection. Carl and I have travelled all over Australia exploring together and he’s one of the best photographers I know, so it’s only right we do this together as well.\n\nI don’t want to give away too many details about the gallery yet, but keep an eye on my social media accounts to stay tuned!\n\n***How do you seek out opportunities to connect with the NFT community and continue to build your profile?***\n\nI try to stay as active as possible on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sllippn) and connect with other [Australians ](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1461133221509296134)who are involved in the NFT scene. I also communicate often with other urban explorers across the globe. We’re in a big group chat together and everyone seems to have each others’ backs and look out for opportunities for each other.\n\nIf the opportunities aren’t there though, I’ll do my best to create them for myself and for others.\n\n***Do you have any advice on how to cultivate a collector base?***\n\nI’m still at the beginning of my NFT journey so I don’t want to speak like I have a strong collector base yet! But from what I’ve experienced and learnt, if you believe in yourself and your art fully, people will too. If you have put in hours, blood, sweat and tears, it will show through your art. I think if collectors are assured that you are in it for the long haul and you can provide value to your work, they will invest and others will follow.\n\nI also think it’s about finding your niche and putting your work in front of the right people who will be interested in your work and have the capacity to invest. This is something I’m still working on, but I plan to keep pursuing it in the near future.\n\n**Who are some of your favourite NFT artists?**\n\nThe boys I mentioned above **[Driftershoots](https://www.instagram.com/driftershoots/?hl=en)** and **[Tom Durante](https://www.instagram.com/tomdurante/)** are amazing and have some incredible artwork. I also love the work of fellow explorers **[@flashinglighhts](https://twitter.com/flashinglighhts)**, **[@NYC_Awaken](https://twitter.com/NYC_Awaken)**, **[@lilmahnaji](https://twitter.com/lilmahnaji)**[ ](https://twitter.com/lilmahnaji)and **[@officialdoumer](https://mobile.twitter.com/officialdoumer)**.\n\nI also think it’s super dope to see other artists such as **[AIMOS](https://twitter.com/IAMAIMOS)** make waves with his NFT project ‘Now Crediting’. This is something that really demonstrated how NFTs can give power to an artist and allow them to get the credit they deserve.\n\n***What are your other creative passions besides art?***\n\nTo be honest, art is pretty much my whole life haha.\n\n***Any advice to anyone looking into entering the NFT space?***\n\nI can only speak for NFT artists, but I’d recommend people to take a lot of time to curate their collections. Allow your work to tell a cohesive story. Put yourself out there on social media, and connect with as many people as you can. Also, believe in yourself fully!\n\n**We look forward to seeing more urban exploration NFT photography in the future and we’re excited to see what [Slippn](https://twitter.com/sllippn/)** has in store with the upcoming NFT Gallery exhibition.\n\n**Be sure to stay connected with [Slippn’s](https://twitter.com/sllippn/)** through these social media links.\n\n**Website:** [slippn.com](https://www.slippn.com/)\n\n**Instagram:** [Slippn](https://www.instagram.com/slippn/)\n\n\\*\\*Twitter: \\*\\*[Sllippn](https://twitter.com/sllippn)\n\n**Opensea NFT Collection**, [Keys to the City](https://opensea.io/collection/keys-to-the-city)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*c_gHJlNYezA_mSgnB17neg.jpeg)\n\n[While the City Sleeps — Opensea NFT Collection, Artist: Slippn](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/269403156313629215206437666834862288230381661764480494041151008005402132481/)\n\n**ABOUT NFTSYD**\n\nThe inaugural [NFTSYD](https://www.nftsyd.io/) in person event in Sydney, Australia will be a deep-dive into everything NFT.

{"id": "zWxw0hUZv11QCU8uOJD6PUDlUOPLIhTVgq7ft_66wUM", "title": "从HODlers增持看比特币市场趋势", "body": "在5月初的抛售之后，增持趋势正在发生一些值得注意的转变。比特币HODLer（坚定持有者）仍然是唯一剩下的增持群体，他们的增持行为预示着当价格修正到3万美元以下时他们会加倍买入。\n\n比特币价格本周继续盘整，此前有初步迹象表明数字资产市场与传统股票市场之间可能出现脱钩，尽管这是在方向错误的情况下。本周标普500指数从低点反弹了7.4%，纳斯达克指数上涨了9.6%。与此同时，比特币交易跌至28261美元的低点，仅在周一早些时候反弹，恢复了30710美元的周高点。以太坊也经历了艰难的一周，下跌了17.8%，至1700美元的低点，然后在周一早上反弹至1900美元。\n\n在本月初 LUNA 引发抛售事件后，比特币在链上的积累趋势出现了明显的行为变化。特别的是，余额<100 BTC 的实体和那些拥有>10000 BTC 的实体一直是重要的积累者。其余的钱包群组也从净分配者过渡到中立者。这反映了与2月至5月中旬期间相比，行为上的明显转变，后者是间歇性的积累和分配，反映了不确定性和资本循环。\n\n然而，链上活动仍然呈现疲软状态，除了现有 HODLer 之外，几乎没有迹象表明对该资产有新的兴趣。也就是说，留下来的 HODLers 似乎愿意在价格下跌时加倍买入，并且即使处于亏损状态，也不愿意抛出 coins。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OWKkYlhbbQtB8DzN3vQCs.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：22周的价格\n\n**仅剩的HODLers**\n\n最近几个月，我们强调了比特币的链上活动如何既低迷又稳定的。这是过去熊市的一个典型特征，网络的交易活动由对价格不敏感的 HODLer 主导。\n\n在 2021 年 5 月的抛售之后，我们目睹了一场钱包的适度“清洗”，因为持有者大量抛售了他们持有的 coin。此后，由于不确定性悄然进入投资者心理，边缘买家被缩水冲出市场，钱包增长出现了长达四个月的平稳增长期。\n\n正如我们在下图中所看到的，最近的价格表现不佳，这使钱包的增长在短期内暂停，尽管与2021年5月的规模不一样。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/devA78lspmpr-FG8TVSKd.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：在非零账户余额下的地址数量\n\n在 LUNA 引发的抛售等高度波动的事件中，我们经常看到链上活动增加，因为持有者恐慌、抛售或以其他方式将 coins 转移到保证金和补仓。在2020 年 3 月和 2018 年 11 月，抛售后活动数量的上升引发了随后的牛市。\n\n虽然不能排除这种可能性，但我们可以看到，活跃地址和实体都对这些活动的增加做出了反应，并回到了在2021 年 9 月以后形成的范围。换句话说，最近的抛售和较低的价格还没有激发新用户涌入该领域，只有 HODLers 有买入。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ry3xx-JLAFOB6r3BqNyR9.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：活动和地点\n\n**累积行为的转变**\n\n当然，链上活动只是现状的一部分。虽然钱包增长和活跃实体可能停滞不前，但该分析并未考虑剩余持有者和钱包的经济价值。随着价格修正走低，HODLers 每美元获得更多 BTC 的能力增加，这引导我们去研究动态的供应的领域。\n\n累积趋势得分在行为上出现了值得注意的转变。近两周来，它已经回到了0.9以上的接近完美的分数。这表明，网络上的现有实体正在大幅增加他们的持股。这是一个明显的突破，在1月至4月的盘整区间（橙色）期间返回的断断续续的分数可以合理地归类为相对低的信念积累。\n\n先前持续高累积趋势得分的情况分为两类：\n\n* 牛市运行期间的高分（蓝色）——在市场顶部的时候，聪明的资金在卖出他们的余额，同时更多经验不足的新买家涌入。\n* 熊市趋势期间的高分（绿色）——通常在价格大幅下跌后触发，因为投资者的心理从不确定性转变为价值积累。但是有一个明显的例外是2021年12月的ATH时期后，\"低点 \"被证明并不是低点，尽管价格大幅度回调，但是有许多 coins在亏损的情况下被卖出。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kaFoUIhgkGqt9KPECXgIs.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：累积趋势得分（7天移动平均）\n\n如果我们对造成这种高积累分数的各种钱包群组进行剖析，我们可以确定两个特定的群体：<100 BTC 的实体，和>10000 BTC 的实体。\n\n研究前者，我们可以看到，在最近的抛售后，他们的钱包总持有量的梯度增加了。此外，这个群体的总余额增加了80,724 BTC，与 LFG (LUNA Foundation Guard)清算的80,081 BTC 净额惊人地相似。实际上，来自<100 BTC 的实体以较低的价格增加的需求已经抵消了 LFG 为维护 UST 挂钩而清算的供应。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P6KLQwTe0JEKsJyO4b58f.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：持有< 100 BTC的实体总供应量\n\n另一个促成高积累趋势得分的群组是持有超10000 BTC 的鲸鱼。在5月期间，这些实体的余额增加了46269 BTC，需要注意的是，这包括从 LFG 钱包中抛售的80000 BTC。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IymYodmh6kB90puFXkE5S.png?height=621&width=1080)\n\n比特币：持有> 10000 BTC的实体总供应量\\[BTC\\]\n\n这些观察在很大程度上可以通过检查按钱包群组指标划分的积累趋势得分来证实。在这里，我们可以看到，自抛售以来，持有<100 BTC和>10000 BTC的实体返回了蓝色信号，表明他们的余额在最近几周有了显著增加。\n\n这与抛售前的相对疲软的价值相比，是一个明显的转变，尤其是当鲸鱼成为卖出主力。其余拥有100-10000 BTC 的钱包群组保持了0.5左右的中性评级，这表明他们的持有量的净变化相对较小。\n\n在下一节中，我们将调查长期持有者的行为，以进一步完善我们的观察。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W2YyccXG7tDnB6Js4_slL.png?height=541&width=1080)\n\n比特币：钱包群组累积趋势得分\n\n**长期损失**\n\n我们现在已经将参与最近链上积累的各种钱包大小群组形成一个案例。接下来，我们转向长期持有者（他们代表了在波动期间最不可能消费的人），以衡量投资者的信念。请注意，过渡到 LTH 状态大约是在 155 天前，即 12 月下旬，当时价格约为 47000 美元。\n\n如果我们看一下2022年4月1日的 URPD 指标，我们可以绘制出 LUNA 抛售之前的 coin 分布概况，重点可以关注 2021-22 周报。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T27BirNM-OlHlPbw8mAl8.png?height=652&width=1080)\n\n比特币：经URPD调整后的实体\\[BTC\\]\n\n下图是 4 月 1 日的概况，并用今天的 URPD （下面的蓝色线条）来覆盖它。由此我们可以评估 coin 分布的变化并做出以下观察：\n\n* 150万 BTC 发生了大规模的重新分配，从主要在42000-49000美元范围内的买家，到下降至当前26700-33000美元范围内的买家。\n* 其他地方的 coin 分布与 4 月 1 日的情况非常相似，这表明对价格不敏感的 HODLer 群体继续主导着比特币持有者的情况。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-67iSTzFXt_bq5H59r2u2.png?height=653&width=1080)\n\n比特币：经URPD调整后的实体\\[BTC\\]\n\n当前币龄小于 3 个月的 coins 的下降趋势支持了这一观察。回顾上一个盘整区间（3月1日之后的3个月）x中间往后所有抛售的 coin ，当3m处的 HODL 波段的下降趋势产生影响时，从净值上看，更多的是币龄更高的 coin。\n\n从这两个指标中得出的关键结论是，在 11 月 ATH 之后积累的 coin 持有者似乎对价格相对不敏感。尽管价格持续下跌，并且发生了80000+ BTC 的重大现货清算事件，他们仍然不愿意放弃他们的 coins。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yw_k8VENAN7wT5ykvXA-C.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：HODL已实现的浪潮上限（<3m）\n\n回想到长期持有者阈值位于12 月下旬，那么 LTH 总供应量最近趋于稳定也就不足为奇了。在过去的几个月里，LTH 门槛一直在沿着从 11 月到 1 月的下降趋势移动。\n\n通常，供应积累发生在横向价格区间内。这意味着在大约 1 个月的时间里，LTH 阈值将进入之前确定的33000-42000美元之间的盘整区间。根据 URPD  的资料，大量的 LTH 供应发生在1月至4月期间。\n\nLTH 供应最近恢复到1304.8M BTC 的 ATH。除非大量的 coin 重新分配，否则我们可以预计该供应指标将在未来 3-4 个月内开始攀升，这表明 HODLers 会持续循序渐进去吸收并保持供应。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uDxg-kSagxgg54TOTKAVP.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：LTH总供应量【BTC】\n\n然而，尽管有建设性的前瞻性观点，但仍有一小部分 LTH 目前正在抛出coins 并导致了亏损。LTH-SOPR 指标可以看作是 LTH 每天实现的平均利润倍数，这个指标很少低于1.0。\n\n本周，我们看到与购买 coins 时相比， LTH 平均花费27%的 coins 锁定损失。过去，此类事件仅在 2015 年、2018 年和 2020 年 3 月等熊市至低点期间发生。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DJUZ-g_5Ri_v63w5QmL5a.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：LTH-SOPR （7天移动平均）\n\n以 LTH-SOPR 作为已实现利润倍数的指标，因此，我们可以从 LTH 抛出的coins “来源”中得出平均价格，即“抛出价格”。LTH 抛出价格（粉红色）很少高于市场价格，但目前在 7 天移动平均线基础上交易价格为 32.8 万美元。上一次 LTH 锁定这样的损失是在 2020 年 3 月的抛售事件之后。在2018 年的熊市中，这发生在 LTH 连续数月下跌之前，并最终导致价格再次下跌 50%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1cw7I-2ZzQ7xoBZlN6Hnx.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n比特币：价格长期持有者的抛售\n\n**总结和结论**\n\n自2021年9月以来，比特币的链上活动趋于平稳，到目前为止，几乎没有迹象表明这种情况会发生改变。这表明 HODLer 是最后的比特币购买者，也是唯一的买家。这也可以从他们不愿意抛出持有的比特币中看出，即使现在是亏损持有。\n\n在 LUNA 引发抛售后，链上的积累趋势发生了显著变化。<100BTC 的实体似乎已经吸收了相当于 LFG在脱钩期间抛售的BTC数量的BTC。与大多数长期持有者一样，越来越多的以似乎较低的价格囤积和收购 BTC 的 HODLer 出现。不出意外的话，这种趋势预计将会在未来几个月推动 LTH 的持币量超过 ATH。\n\n通过对比特币所处宏观环境的密切关注，有迹象表明数字资产和股票之间存在脱钩。是否会重新出现相关性回报以及市场对通货紧缩如何反应还不确定，但风险仍然很高，对于对价格不敏感的 HODLers 来说也是如此。\n\n文章来源：https://insights.glassnode.com\n\n原文作者：Checkmate\n\n原文链接：https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-22-2022/", "timestamp": 1654767969, "digest":

That object is often a digital asset (**Token**) and might take the form of a music, picture, book, contract, or legal agreement. Almost everything that can be produced digitally may be classified as an asset. So long as it's original and not plagiarised, which was the primary fear of online artists when it comes to putting anything on the internet... until blockchain came along.\n\n## Blockchain, huh?\n\nBlockchain is the technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency variants. Blockchain is a digital public ledger that records data and prevents it from being altered.\n\nConsider a spreadsheet that is shared across thousands of computers all around the world. Consider this network of computer that will be used to update this system of records doing it on a regular basis.\n\n## Blockchain and web3 ❤ NFT’s\n\nWe now have a basic understanding of what an NFT is and how blockchain works. What's the connection between the two? The blockchain technology is required to verify and protect NFTs, ushering us into the era of digital ownership.\n\nWe can now verify if an NFT belongs to a given wallet thanks to the strength and power of blockchain technology (blockchain address). This is extremely powerful because we've never had the technology to verify ownership of something on the internet before, but now we do. As a result, we can now certify that a single wallet has a unique piece of art.\n\n**But what about 'right-click and save'?**\n\nMany people say that simply capturing a snapshot of an NFT means they can claim ownership of these NFTs. Well..taking a snapshot of a Picasso does not imply that you own it. You are not the lawful owner of an asset just because you took a snapshot of it. Blockchain technology gives you ownership of the original (smart) contract and a total claim of the NFT (asset).\n\n## NFTs and Community\n\nNow that we know what NFTs are, the major issue is why individuals are willing to spend half a million dollars on pixel (digital) art.\n\nMany NFTs projects have spawned initiatives that have brought thousands of people together to form a community around them. Users are drawn to these communities because of their unique value and/or usability. For instance, an NFT might be a 1/1 (one-of) version or have characteristics that distinguish it from the other NFTs in the project, making it more valuable.\n\nCommunity NFT Projects provide scarce artwork while also giving value to NFT holders. These utilities can range from real-life events to unique access, voting rights on funding allocation, and anything else that brings utility to the NFT and hence raises its value. In addition, the wallet holder can sell (trade) their NFTs for a higher price to someone who wants to join the community.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nThe communities we've been a part of and the love and passion we've witnessed in NFTs has encouraged us to bring it to the Sydney area. So, in April 2022, we'll be holding the first Premier NFT Sydney event. Educate and support our local community about NFTs and the advantages they can provide is our core mission. \n\n👉 [nftsyd.io](http://nftsyd.io/)\n\n[crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=](crowdfund://0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4?features=)\n\nnft syd, nft sydney , nft community , nft australia", "timestamp": 1654768222, "digest": "G8Qb3cyO5nMn7HAjss9zvHrHd4czetDzBwCKJ2R1t-o", "contributor": "0x5922cB3dF34a6eE3253eb6DcB01e78586753FdC4"}

{"id": "GQOs64lRM1jDqb6afp0YEWH02Io0NXZq-Gl9EDR4XIw", "title": "区块链能否撑起元宇宙这片天", "body": "有人讲：Web3世界的尽头是元宇宙。这个观点为加密圈内人所认可。元宇宙的概念其实涵盖了我们的生活、工作与娱乐，是我们整个现实世界到虚拟世界的孪生，反过来又将会对我们的现实世界带来激烈的变革。但是，这片元宇宙的天空太大了，想要撑起来，除了VR/AR，甚至体全息等的视觉与触感，以及5G通讯和AI等技术突破外，实实在在离不开Web3的基石：区块链技术。\n\n区块链能否成为元宇宙的一根擎天柱？它能给元宇宙发展带来什么积极的作用？我们可以关注哪些这方向的区块链技术或领域?\n\n​        在这篇文章里，我们就将围绕这些问题，从元宇宙的概念和方向，以及区块链的现状和技术上，展开研究与分析，希望能为大家解开这些问题的谜团，为我们的投资或研发提供一些帮助。\n\n# 1. 什么是元宇宙？\n\n​        元宇宙，就是人类现实世界到虚拟世界一个投射：\n\n![图1 真实世界到元宇宙的投射](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mkJ9eQvJuckC4yjoPtiQy.png?height=635&width=807)\n\n​        从功能上讲，元宇宙是承载人们虚拟活动的平台，用户可以在其上进行社交、娱乐、创作、展示、教育，以及虚拟资产交易等，这些映射到我们现实世界中社会的、或精神的各方面活动。同时，它会有以下相较现实世界的突出特点：\n\n1. 没有准入门槛。\n2. 基于程序合约的公平性。\n3. 更加可靠的经济系统。\n4. 更加丰富的消费内容。\n\n​        同时，用户通过在元宇宙上进行创作、交易、学习或开会等活动，会与现实世界相结合而产生以下的感受：\n\n1. 沉浸式交互体验。\n2. 情感上的寄托。\n3. 心理上的归属。\n\n​        现在的元宇宙的Web3应用或公司，主要是以游戏为主，或者围绕着游戏而生，比如`Decentraland`、`Roblox`。因此，有人把游戏列为元宇宙的4大支柱技术（显示、通信、区块链与游戏）之一。这点其实是有失偏颇的，因为元宇宙所能承载的将不仅仅是游戏。所以应该是Web3应用，正是由这些应用板块，组成了元宇宙里的社区。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙的本质是要自由可信地承载人们的社交身份和资产权益，以及围绕着这两个的，可与现实世界相映射的所有活动。这些活动体现在元宇宙里，就是一个个Web3的应用。这其实是对现实世界底层逻辑的复制，使得元宇宙成为了一个很好的平台，让任何用户可以在它的上面创建或加入社区，参与创造，而且劳动的成果将得到保障。因此，人们在元宇宙里的劳动、交易与现实中的劳动与交易没有区别：用户在`Dencentraland`里建造的虚拟房子，可以不受平台限制，轻松交易，换成元宇宙甚至现实世界里的物品，其价格将由自由市场决定。\n\n​        上述元宇宙的活动，要比现实世界更加方便与可靠。因为它充分利用了区块链技术的去中心化协议与经济激励规则，通过分布式系统和程序，来保障元宇宙上活动的有序执行，与资产的抗审查确权。\n\n​        但是有人要问了：元宇宙里不管是从现实世界里采样的信息，还是直接在元宇宙里生成的信息，随着元宇宙的繁荣，就要生成现实世界方方面面的数字孪生；这对于区块链来讲，就是超多的交易，超大的数据，现在的区块链，或区块链技术（比如以太坊），能支撑的住吗？\n\n# 2. 元宇宙希望区块链提供哪些支撑？\n\n​        我们先来看看元宇宙当前主要的应用有哪些：\n\n1. 媒体舆情：像VeeR、斗鱼等主要是利用VR+5G的技术，把当下流行Web2的视频点播或VR游戏，简单搬移到了元宇宙上；倒是有个有趣的现象是视频网站从元宇宙的卡通人物里吸取灵感，给主播选换元宇宙头像，在Web2的视频网站上大受欢迎。\n2. 社交游戏：这个是最贴合元宇宙属性的场景，像腾讯就借微信、QQ的用户量在积极拓展元宇宙社交，而网易游戏、米哈游也从游戏角度纷纷杀入元宇宙。\n3. 电商会展：电商直播与电商税收成为国家整治对象，最近的疫情给会展业带来了重创，而元宇宙让电商会展看到新的契机，百度与华为都在这块有着积极的尝试。\n4. 教体文卫：这个也是元宇宙切入比较多的板块，像腾讯就联合敦煌打造元宇宙数字原生NFT，倡导元宇宙游赏敦煌石窟的游玩。\n5. 智能制造：就智能制造本身而言，它是独立的，但我们应该看到，像有些高级制造与高级维修，由于高端师傅的稀缺，因而对于分散的门店或工厂，具有远程指导与治理的真实需求，这个也是与元宇宙相契合的，但我个人只看到一些汽车的后端市场，会用到AR远程指导，还没有真正迁移到元宇宙。\n6. 政治军事：比较容易想到的利用元宇宙的3D仿真城市管理与实战演练了。\n7. 其他应用：除了以上6大类，目前对元宇宙有所涉略的还包括：数字金融、房地产、产业园和农业等。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙所能涵盖的应用或业务，远不至这些，我们大可以从经济、社会、生产、科技、教育和生活诸多方面，展开极限想象：元宇宙里资源无限，因此人们只为快乐而干活；社会将由人治走向法治，再到数学治的转变；从此创意是唯一的技能，什么学这学那的，都不需要，只要保持创造性思维能力就掌握了生产力；在元宇宙的世界里，科技似乎真的有机会触达神灵，因为元宇宙里有不断自我演进的人类智慧；学习的精髓不再是记忆而是遗忘，因为元宇宙会随时帮您记忆，并修正你曾记错的地方；生活真得将变得如此简单，互联网给大家带来的便利有目共睹，元宇宙肯定将让我们世界变得更加方便、更加简单。\n\n​        天下没有免费的午餐，元宇宙是很美好，但它离不开科技，工程，以及底层各技术的框架的支撑。下面是赵国栋老师关于元宇宙的技术框架图：\n\n![1654520381674](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654520381674.png)\n\n​        其中红框处的`去中心化层`就是我们这里所关心的区块链。虽然赵老师这个图很好地表述了元宇宙的架构，但没能清楚地表述区块链的组成，及其层次逻辑，所以我们更乐意用下面一张图来理解元宇宙中的区块链：\n\n![1654528816325](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654528816325.png)\n\n​        这张图是ENChain.Asia的朱峰在BAO的白皮书里第一次提出`自商业`的框架图，它与元宇宙Web3应用的自主经营比较吻合。但该图里还没有很好地体现Web3应用的业务。我们知道，Web3应用其实是由两部分组成的：\n\n1. 后端：也就是运行在区块链网络上的业务处理逻辑。\n2. 前端：也就是我们一般用户看到的Web页面等。\n\n![1654529471702](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654529471702.png)\n\n​        其中淡橙色部分组成了元宇宙Web3应用的业务部分。而后端我们把激励层、治理层、仲裁层和合规层理解为Web3应用在区块链上，基于智能合约的逻辑处理部分，同时，为了适应元宇宙`去中心化自主治理`的业务诉求，还整合进了`自商业` 的逻辑。\n\n​        另外，也有人把区块链比作元宇宙的粘合剂，通过把终端、云计算、AI、大数据与网络相关整合一起，为元宇宙的实现建立起底层的技术基础：\n\n![1654568730044](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654568730044.png)\n\n​        通过上面4张图，我们大体可以理解区块在元宇宙体系里，所处的位置和大概作用。下面我们来进一步分析元宇宙，期望区块链可以提供哪些基础的功能，来支撑它重建一个新世界的远大目标。\n\n​        为了更好地分析，我们把元宇宙关于区块链的诉求，分成一般性需求，和特殊性需求来看。\n\n1. 一般性需求，也就是针对一般Web3应用就需要的。\n2. 特殊性需求，则是元宇宙具体特殊的需求。\n\n​        首先，跑在元宇宙的业务应用肯定也是Web3应用，因此我们可以看到元宇宙，会对区块链提出4类一般性需求：\n\n1. 一种自我激励可靠的去中心化网络，来承载元宇宙的业务。\n2. 一种共识可信的超级账本，来记录元宇宙中活动的点点滴滴。\n3. 一种分布式的不可篡改存储，来确保元宇宙数据的真实性。\n4. 一种基于智能合约的法则，来有效约束各参与方的行为规范。\n\n​        另外，元宇宙作为一个创造新世界的庞大复杂的系统，它应会考虑以下6点，区块链不能成为它的瓶颈：\n\n1. 要能支持几乎无限丰富的应用场景。\n2. 要能支持高并发的交易量。\n3. 要能支持大吞吐的数据量。\n4. 要能与现实世界流畅沟通。\n5. 要能确保隐私。\n6. 商业经营高度自治等。\n\n​        对于一般性需求而言，众所周知，正是区块链技术所擅长的；也正是因为区块链拥有了这些能力，也给了大家想象元宇宙的空间。但元宇宙反过来，则又对区块链提出了更高的要求。下面我们重点关注**区块链可不可能支撑元宇宙的这些更高要求**？\n\n# 3. 区块链能否撑起元宇宙？\n\n## 3.1 不可能三角原则\n\n​        在回答这个问题之前，我们先来认识一下区块链的不可能三角原则。因为它将是我们下面立论的基础。\n\n![1654330699739](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654330699739.png)\n\n​        区块链不可能三角（blockchain trilemma）由以太链创始人Vitalik 提出：也就是说区块链技术不能同时实现去中心化性程度、安全性和高效性。其中：\n\n1. 去中心化是指拥有大量区块生产和验证的节点，一般节点越多，去中心化程度越高。\n2. 安全性是获得网络控制权所要花费的成本，通常在共识机制的设计中锚定现实世界的资产，例如工作量证明机制锚定的是算力。\n3. 高效性就是每秒处理交易的笔数。\n\n​        正是不可能三角原则，使得各种区块链的设计与实现中，只能三者舍其一：要么是确保资本安全，共识基础牢靠；要么是单位吞吐量大，交易费便宜；要么是数据存储技术出众，存储费低廉。这也就导致现在难有一条链，或一种链就可以支撑起元宇宙的特殊需求。\n\n## 3.2 各具特色的区块链\n\n### 3.2.1 大小王\n\n​       首先就是2008年由中本聪发布的`比特币`，它标识了区块链1.0的诞生，一举奠定了区块链的思想与关键技术，是名符其实的区块链大王。比特币带给我们的区块链特征包括：\n\n1. 以区块组成的链条存储交易信息或数据。\n2. 整个区块链网络所共识且共享的超级账本，确保账本的真实性。\n3. 应用了非对称加密算法，通过公钥与私钥结合的方式搭建了区块链的安全防御系统。\n4. 源代码公开，使得区块链网络中设定的共识机制、规则等都可以通过一致的、开源的源代码进行验证。\n5. 贯彻去中心化的思想，包括中本聪到底是何许人也，到现在也不知道（否则中本聪在区块链领域的话语权要比V神大）。\n6. P2P的分布式网络，区块链网络将是去中化的分布式网络。\n\n![1654570644997](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654570644997.png)\n\n​        人们看到，比特币在不可能三角中，特别注重了`去中心化`与`安全`,所以它的TPS特别低，且延时长；而且它脚本类的链上程序不是图灵完备的。虽然区块链1.0比较好地解决了货币发行与支付的去中心化，但应用场景还是很受限。为此区块链的小王以太坊，由Vitalik Buterin于2013年创建，它标识着区块链2.0的诞生。\n\n​        `以太坊`在比特币的基础上，创建了一个图灵完备的虚拟机EVM。因此，人们可以在以太坊上编写智能合约；理论上，可以在该EVM上实现任何复杂的逻辑。为此，Ｖ神在以太坊诞生之初，喊出了以太坊要成为`世界计算机`的口号。\n\n![1654602110810](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654602110810.png)\n\n​        但是以太坊的设计虽然有不少创新，但终究是脱胎于比特币，还是过于关注货币的安全与去中心化，因此它的TPS也不高，而基于智能合约的旺盛业务需求，导致了时常区块爆炸和交易费高昂等诸多问题。\n\n​        不管怎样，由于多年下来，用户没有更好的选择，以太坊业已成为Web3应用开发的首选，和业界标杆。\n\n### 3.2.2 廉价的存储\n\n​        以太坊通过智能合约，解决了市场交易的去中心化。但对用户来讲，这些交易会伴随大量的数据，而且用户也会有需要数据确权存储的需求（这点在元宇宙里将会显得特别突出）。但对于以太坊这类区块链来讲，不是功能上实现不了，而是性能上难以满足：\n\n1. `$10000+/GB年`的费用，让一般用户无法接受。\n2. `13 x 6 = 78s`的延时，让音、视频实时播放类业务只能望而止步。\n\n​        为此，Filecoin与Arweave，抓住这个痛点，纷纷推出了自己的存储区块链，以及配套的服务。我们就以Filecoin为例，来看看它是如何实现高效的数据存储与访问的。\n\n![1653622321102](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1653622321102.png)\n\n​        Filecoin如上图所示，它其实是一个体系，基于区块链的技术，来支持可靠、快速，却又廉价的链上数据存储与访问服务。其中：\n\n1. 右下部分，它实现了Filecoin基础区块链部分：\n\n* 它是标准的P2P区块链网络，但该网络只是负责存储交易及FIL激励相关事务，并不存储用户数据（比如音、视频）；\n* 数据的存储是由该网络上的各个参与节点与用户达成数据存储与访问的deal(这个交易是要上FIlecoin区块链的)，再根据IPFS格式，在节点上封装扇区，并存储数据；但该节点要负责通过ZK技术生成PoRep和PoSt证明，交给Filecoin区块链网络共识。\n\n​        事实上，存储到Filecoin网络上速度也不快，它一般只会做48小时内完成承诺，而且允许超大数据量的存储在链下完成。所以Filecoin网络上的数据存储，也被称作冷存储。\n\n1. 顶上部分，它就是实现的星际文件系统IPFS，以便基于文件的内容，并支持大数据量的存储与访问：\n\n* IPFS也是个P2P的分布式网络，但并不是区块链，因此它上面的活动并不需要共识，只是利用了分布式网络冗余备份功能；\n* 所以IPFS又被称作热存储，在Filecoin体系被用作Cache技术；\n* 但缓存在内存空间不足时很容易被清除，这样会导致用户通过IPFS请求Filecoin的存储服务，很可能会在没有完成冷存储之前，就被清除了；因此在顶部右上角，又增加了一个IPFS PIN Service，来确保用户数据可以在IPFS这个分布式网络里保存足够长的时间。\n\n1. 另一个就是上图右边的`web3.storage`之类的网关服务了，它提供了RPC API，方便用户轻松访问Filecoin网络。\n\n​        可以看到，Filecoin在充分利用区块链技术的同时，还充分结合了链外的以下辅助技术，才得以实现便宜的、支持大吞吐的、安全可信的数据存储与访问的服务：\n\n1. 零知识证明；\n2. 分布式集群；\n3. SaaS网关等。\n\n​        通过Filecoin一组产品体系的设计，它可以在获取不可能三角的去中心化和安全基础上，还获得了链上数据大吞吐访问的高效性。当然，现在大家使用下来，感觉IPFS上数据下载还是慢，这个倒是应该通过增加IPFS集群的并发处理能力，以及Web3.Storage等API网关的网络带宽来解决。\n\n### 3.2.3 突破交易量的瓶颈\n\n​        继了解决大吞吐数据存储方案后，那再来看元宇宙关于支持交易高并发的诉求。我们都知道，比特币原始链和以太链的交易并发数并不多，时延反而长，交易费反而高：\n\n![1654590584969](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654590584969.png)\n\n​        这些弱点，仅让以太坊或比特币来支持元宇宙是不可能的。也正是看到这些弱点，各Layer2扩容方案纷纷出台，或者有的链干脆另起炉灶，完全设计出一条独立的支持高交易量的链：\n\n1. Layer2 扩容方案：它的思想本质就是通过将交易的处理从Layer1的区块链，迁移到了被称Layer2层，并对该处理生成一个证明，而Layer1层只作关于该证明的验证；而验证证明的计算量小很多，从而可以大幅地降低Layer1层区块链的负荷，也就提升了整个区块链业务TPS；当然Layer2层还会用到Sequenser等排序与压缩技术，来进一步提高TPS；目前Layer2的扩容路线主要是Rollup，它能实现Layer1层1\\~2个数量级的扩容。\n\n![1654596595148](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654596595148.png)\n\n1. Layer1独立链交易量的极致突破：它直接让Layer1区块链本身拥有更高的TPS；它往往是以牺牲安全或去中心化来获取更高的单位时间交易量；其中典型的案例有Solana，它的设计中一个时间点只有一个Leader节点出块，而其它的节点只对块中的交易进行验证；因为它的出块，再不是区块链网络里所有节点竞争，所以它会快许多，但显然安全性会下降许多；为此Solana设计了随时间单向的PoH协议，以及TowerBFT协议等，来尽量弥补单个Leader出块中心化不安全的弱点；Solana的TPS可达5万+。\n\n![1649751154101](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1649751154101.png)\n\n​        据Solana白皮书介绍，基于Solana链的交易量瓶颈不再在链本身，而在网络带宽。\n\n### 3.2.4 跨链\n\n​        从前面3个小节的分析，我们确实可以看到，区块链有的去中化程度高，安全可靠，有的可以突破TPS瓶颈，有的则可以很好满足便宜可信大数据量的存储。这些都是元宇宙所需要的。为此，除了独立区块链分布式网络相关的技术外，还需要相关跨链技术，把不同的区块链连接起来，促使它们之间货币信息的流通，甚至可以互操作。对应着这种技术的产品，被大家形象地称为跨链桥。\n\n​        V神把跨链技术的演进和实现方式，总结为3类：\n\n1. 哈希时间锁合约：通过一套密码学方法，来实现不同链上资产的交易；但只能是资产类交易，不能实现资产在不同链上流通，更不能互操作了；下面3张图就显示了基于哈希锁和时间锁，实现将比特币交换成以太的过程：\n\n![1654610756141](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654610756141.png)\n\n![1654610696560](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654610696560.png)\n\n![1654610720888](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654610720888.png)\n\n1. 公证人机制：是由公证人建立一个中间账户，用户将资产转入中间账户，由公证人跨链发行一种映射原Token的影子Token给到用户；当用户需要赎回的时候，将影子Token销毁，并向公证人提供证明，公证人将中间账户的原始Token转到该用户的地址；基于公证人的方案，可以实现资产在不同链，或异构链上流通；但这个流通的可信度，是依赖于这个第三方公证人可信度的。\n2. 桥接链方案：它是当前主流的跨链技术；与公证人方案一样，仍然存在一个中间账户，但中间账户的安全，不靠公证人来保护，而是靠智能合约来规范，这意味着中间账户将是一个合约账户，其资产管理规则被智能合约的代码约束，而不是由公证人约束；如果代码本身没有问题，只要部署该合约的链是安全的，那么合约中的资产就是安全的；像波卡和Cosmos不仅要实现支持资产流通，甚至支持它们同构子链之间的互操作。\n\n​        要说明的一点是：桥接链应搭建在双图灵完备的链间，因为桥接链不是一个独立的存在，而需要部署在两端链上的合约配合，就像一座桥不能悬空存在，必须在两岸有桥墩作为依托一样。\n\n![1654612444169](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654612444169.png)\n\n​        而桥接链方案又可分成3个流派：\n\n1. 通用跨链派：它专注于跨链，旨在实现适配区块链领域存在的所有链，其典型代表是Polygon\n\n![1654652680266](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654652680266.png)\n\n​        上图中的蓝色图标就表示是Polygon。但细心的你会发现它是以`以太坊`为中心的。因为Polygon的目标是`实现一个以太坊兼容链的互联网`。但我们前面讨论了，在元宇宙里，除了以太坊，还需要有诸如Filecoin等的区块链网络；并且对于元宇宙业务应用来讲，尽管以太坊已成为许多人认可的`世界记账机`，也不一定就是中心（区块链应该排斥中心的）。\n\n1. 引流跨链派：它往往是Layer1的独立链，需要借用以太坊更丰富的货币体系，以及引流以太坊上大量的免教育用户，其典型代表有Solana Wormhole\n\n![1654654191766](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654654191766.png)\n\n​        Wormhole在以太坊与Solana之间，搭建一条双向、去中心化的 ERC-20⇄SPL 代币桥。Solana主打的这条`trustless`桥，让以太坊的DeFi交易者和应用，在两条链上进行资产转换，并享受Solana的高TPS和低转账成本的服务；而且基于Wormhole，开发者可以继续使用之前为以太坊编写的智能合约。细心的你有可能发现上图左下角的`Terra`作为Luna的基础链，已经崩了；这里还选用这张图，主要是想警示大家，在通过跨链技术，连接不同区块链时，注意链想到之间产生`连环雪崩`灾害；这是元宇宙安全所在，由于安全问题不在是本篇文章的重点，就不展开了。\n\n1. 互操作跨链流派：它不仅要实现不同链之间代币的流通，更专注于链之间的`互操作`,链之间真正的互联互通，其典型代表有Polkadot最新发布的XCM\n\n![1654656833460](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654656833460.png)\n\n​        XCM是波卡的跨共识消息格式（Cross-Consensus Messaging format）的简称，XCM不仅支持链之间的通信，还支持智能合约、Dapp和Substrate pallet（模块）之间的通信，从而实现了不同链之间的消息传递，与类似RPC调用的互操作。但我们也应看到：XCM不能用于在系统之间实际“发送”任何消息，它的效用只在于表达接收者应该做什么；XCM是消息格式，需要搭配消息传递协议使用，才能完成消息的跨链。还有就是，XCM只适用于Polkadot家族中的平行链之间的跨链。\n\n​        通过上面的分析我们可以知道，由于不同链之间的共识机制，所有虚拟机和智能合约架构的不同，链之间的互联互通，还是有不少难度。但经过不同厂商的努力，我们也看到现在的跨链桥技术，已基本可以将不同的功能的区块链技术捏合在一起，来打破区块链的不可能三角，从而满足以元宇宙既要去中心化，又要安全，还要高效的诉求。\n\n​        另注：跨链桥这块，作者推荐大家关注Polkadot与Cosmos之类专注链互操作的区块链体系。因为它们理论上可以构建各种功能和特色的链，而且这些链在同一体系下，在设计之初，就充分考虑了跨链互联的需求。\n\n## 3.3 满足不可能三角之后呢？\n\n​        通过3.2节的分析，我们知道，基于跨链桥技术，可以将具有不同功能与特色的链连接起来，从而使得不可能三角的安全性、去中心化和高效性的三者兼得。但元宇宙的特殊需求尚不止于此。\n\n### 3.3.1 可用不可见的隐私计算\n\n​        元宇宙尽管是个虚拟世界，但其中还是关联到现实生活中的，会附带着各种数字资产，以及大量的个人隐私信息。所以在元宇宙里往往会采用DID（去中心化的身份证），来绑定用户在元宇宙里的身份，并进而把与之相关的资产和数据归之名下。\n\n​        这个小节我们主要谈谈用户链上数据隐私保护的问题。我们可以发现以下几点前提：\n\n1. 首先，这些数据要是为元宇宙所有用户认可的，所以数据就应存放在去中心化的区块链网络上，比如Filecoin。\n2. 为了保护隐私，这些数据应是加密存储，只有用户自身才能读取其中的内容。\n3. 但这些隐私数据如果元宇宙不能使用，那就无法提取该用户的相关属性，也难以为该用户提供更好的服务。\n\n![1654734630484](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654734630484.png)\n\n​        如上图，`元宇宙渔业监管部门`需要监查`元宇宙渔船`是否超出了捕捞海域，需要渔船的`元宇宙海域坐标`；渔船认为该坐标信息是它的隐私，不便提供；而监管部门没有坐标是没有办法监管。因此现实世界里，只能由监管部门强制收取，最后由于职权部门的泄密，导致个人安全或利益受损，个人往往也只能认倒霉。\n\n​        我们知道，数据的处理包括三个环节：传输、存储与计算。其中，传输、存储的安全已有相关技术，但数据的`安全计算`一直没有一条通用性的方案，也就是讲，现有的数据安全计算方案，往往只能应用于特定的场景。我们对数据安全计算的目标，主要定位在`数据可用不可见`上，所以又将数据安全计算，称为`隐私计算`。由于数据已成为最重要的生产资料，隐私计算将显得越来越重要。当前的主要的隐私计算技术分类有：\n\n![1654737108366](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654737108366.png)\n\n​        基于以上分析，元宇宙也是需要隐私计算的技术，来确保用户隐私数据的`可用不可见`；而且为了节约网络带宽资源，实现的隐私计算功能模块，**应当贴近区块链端**。其中`零知识证明`技术，已在区块链里被广泛使用。前面我们提到过，像Filecoin里的PoRep与PoSt就利用了零知识证明。但这项技术只能证明数据存储行为本身，并不能从该数据里抽取有用的属性，比如渔船越界了。为此，在元宇宙里，还应充分利用`联邦学习`，`可信执行环境`等技术，并把它们有机结合起来：\n\n1. 搭建`联邦学习`等AI计算集群，提供支持保护隐私的神经网络训练与预判环境，为元宇宙提供类似人工智能感知层，但这个感知是去中心化的。\n2. 搭建可信执行环境，由于该环境需要支持AI的训练与计算，所以元宇宙里的可信执行环境是服务器集群级别，与手机和安全卡之类的可信执行环境，在物理上不是一个量级。\n\n​        其是在元宇宙里联邦学习集群与可信执行环境集群，可以合二为一，形成一种类似`PaaS`的服务。作者认为，这应该是元宇宙的一项基础构件，像元宇宙中社区自治（DAO）中，特别倚重的声誉系统，没有AI，没有确保隐私的AI，学习性、公正性、有效性就难以保证。想要建立元宇宙的良性生态，不妨先把这个基础服务做起来。如果您看好元宇宙，这将是一块真正的`busyness`。但目前似乎少有企业或组织，真正把它当作业务，或者以PaaS、BaaS的眼光来看待它。\n\n### 3.3.2 Oracle沟通物理世界\n\n​        通过3.3.1小节的讨论，我们通过采用多种隐私计算技术，可以保障元宇宙中用户个体数据的隐私安全。但如果区块链相以支撑起元宇宙，我们认为尚有不足，因为元宇宙不仅仅是现实世界的搬迁，它还需要与物理世界的交流与互动。像海尔在组建的元宇宙工厂，如不与现实工厂相关联，对海尔来讲是没有意义的。\n\n​        元宇宙与物理世界的交互，其实就是物理世界信息要更新到元宇宙的区块链网络中，而区块链网络处理的结果，应该反映到现实中去。这种交互，就需要所谓的Oracle技术（预言机）。该技术在DeFi里使用比较多，其中典型的代表就是Chainlink。\n\n![1654740248826](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654740248826.png)\n\n​        它的工作机制是：\n\n```\n  1. Chainlink构成了一个去中心化的分布式网络，并通过Oracle合约与以太坊等区块链锚定。\n  2. 用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Adapter服务；该服务会从不物理信源处采集所需要的信息，比如各DEX关于LINK Token的价格，进行汇总，并根据用户的喜好采用这些信息，调用Oracle合约，自动触发相关的链上交易。\n  3. 链上的逻辑处理完好，又可以调用Oracle合约，将信息返回给Chainlink网络；用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Initiator服务；该服务根据Oracle返回的信息，再触发现实世界的相关交易。\n```\n\n​        元宇宙与现实世界的沟通，也需要诸如Chainlink之类的Oracle技术：使得两个世界息息相生。\n\n### 3.3.3 DAO\n\n​        经过上面的分析，我们就来看看最后一个点：那就是元宇宙的商业自治。这个诉求与区块链的DAO是极其吻合的。\n\n![1654742945289](C:%5CUsers%5CAdmin%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5C1654742945289.png)\n\n​        DAO是指去中心化自治组织，它伴随区块链而诞生，并一经出现，就热度不减。因为它有以下鲜明的特点：\n\n1. 去中心化、自动化和透明，所有要遵守的规则都由链上公开的智能合约来定。\n2. 社区驱动，规则的决定与调整，也就是组织的决策权，赋予社区里所有的代币持有者，由大家投票裁决；往往这种权力是与社员持有代币量成正比；因而让社区成为利益休戚相关且真正民主。\n3. 具有潜在的投资回报，DAO中所持有的治理代币，正如初创公司早期持有的股权：后面一旦成功，这些代币会非常有价值。\n\n​        这里，我们应将DAO的治理代币，与区块链的原生代币区别开来。原生代币是区块链网络为了维护其网络生态繁荣的经济激励措施而发行，从某种意义上讲，是存在类似`货币超发`现象，或讲超前消费嫌疑。而DAO的治理代币，它应是绑定在社区实际的成长上的：只有社区有价值，它的治理代币才会有价值。当然，不可否认，DAO的治理代币也起着经济激励的基础作用，如第2章中的7层架构中的`激励层`所示，它将给予社区美好的预期，促进社区成员，为着共同的目标一起努力。这点是与元宇宙的自商业完全一致。\n\n​        但是，我们也要看到DAO的一个致命的弱点：什么事都要靠投票来决定。这样，当有问题时，特别是重大紧急问题时，也要通过投票解决？2016年以太坊的`The Dao`事故，仍然历历在目。以太坊的做法是人为干涉，但这又与去中心化思想相悖，从而为人所诟病，并由此导致了以太坊的硬分叉。所以，元宇宙在社区自治过程中，还应设计好此类事件的应对方案。\n\n# 4. 结论\n\n​        元宇宙还有很长的路要走，但它美好的前景，值得Facebook去投入，也值我们所有人去追寻。元宇宙少不了区块链，这点已为业界共识。同时，从上面的分析来看，通过组合不同的区块链，以及隐私计算等相关技术，是有机会支撑起元宇宙的各类应用，以及对大家对元宇宙未来的畅想。\n\n​        当然，区块链相关的技术还有待发展，这也何尝不是机会。作者认为，我们可以重点关注：\n\n1. 开放式的跨链桥技术，将元宇宙需要的各种链有机、灵活地连接起来。\n2. 集成联邦学习与可信执行环境集群的BaaS服务。\n3. 具有通识基础的元宇宙声誉系统，打造元宇宙的DAO，建立基于`数字治`的良序公约。", "timestamp": 1654768558, "digest": "hYOaJFFtLrlJ3_CSClzJo_hAwKYb9-6w6dwK1_WaLQM", "contributor": "0x8fB6C85590aC6fFd0Dc31A95800C084F2DaAb5fe"}

{"id": "vJIpknY2k9snr_Y-sTO-ebJWki_bcP1iNGm5K7x0ajU", "title": "日拱一卒：Stepn 项目反思", "body": "### 写在最前面\n\n其实我这篇文章写了几天了，一直纠结着没发出来。但后来想了想，还是发出来，因为这个总结不是为了别的，是为了反思和提高。\n\n我们为什么要反思？就是为了改进，让自己下一次不会再犯之前的错误。能改的，叫做缺点，不能改的，叫做弱点。\n\n所以，有效的总结是这次的经验可以应用到下一次，否则如果这样，我知道自己这次做不好，但是我下次还是继续没进步，这样就属于自我欺骗的总结，给自己营造一种幻觉，觉得自己可以赚到，应该赚到，但实际上，这对以后的操作毫无帮助。\n\n### 正式开始\n\n从 5 月 25 号开始，不管是参与者还是项目方，都经历了一段至暗时刻。从某种意义上说，这不是坏事，只有经历过一些至暗时刻，个人或公司才能成长的更好，几乎没有个体或公司可以在一帆风顺的情况下发展壮大。\n\n最近很多人也在总结得失，我一直在整理自己的思路，今天把我的总结分享出来，以期待自己在以后的投资中可以做的更好。\n\n在互联网公司有个 retrospect，经常会总结一段时间项目的得失，主要聚焦在三点：做的好的、做的不好的、有待改进的。做得好的这里可以忽略，主要我会总结做的不好的以及有待改进的。重要的是成功的经验是否可以复制，失败的地方以后能否避免，自己的经验能否给他人提供可借鉴的地方。而不是去嘚瑟自己的收益或者哭诉自己的失败博取同情。\n\n在我这段时间观察，市场上的人群可以分为三类，当然不一定准，只是我个人的想法：\n\n* 有经验的投资者，他们不在乎项目怎么样，或者不是那么在乎，他们在乎的是这个项目自己赚到钱没有。\n* 有一点理想主义的 Web3 参与者，他们某种意义上更在意项目的长期发展，会从各个角度给项目方出谋划策，让项目可以继续发展下去\n* 跟风者，这类人是情绪指标的观察标的，对项目没什么研究，想赚大钱，但不愿研究，对项目的转变态度非常之快，赚到钱的时候是小甜甜，亏钱的时候就是项目方就是个割韭菜的。他们赚钱时候不会感谢项目，亏钱的时候必然把项目方骂的狗血淋头，却不会从自己身上找原因。\n\n所以，如果想让自己做的更好，要跟第一类人学习如何在各类项目赚钱，但是最好也保持一点理想主义，然后观察第三类人，时刻提醒自己不要成为第三类人。\n\n### 我个人的总结\n\n我之前总结过一次，提到我虽然是早期的参与者，但是收益没有想象中的高。主要原因之一是对很多玩法后来失去了敏感。特别是 BNB 链的 mint 流，我一开始一直觉得贵，然后觉得再搞一个助记词有点麻烦，一直拖到我的空投鞋子到了，才补了另外一双去研究 mint 流。我根本没去研究为何双方差价这么大，里面的风险和利润在哪里。我应该如何参与。\n\n教训一：对于项目里推荐的新玩法，一定要第一时间去研究，根据自己的风险偏好，制定自己的参与策略（甚至不参与也是一直策略，但是你要研究，要知道不参与的逻辑，而不是一无所知的不参与）。\n\n教训二：心态开放，不要在没做任何研究之前给投资标的贴标签，不要先入为主。\n\n然后关于回本，首先，我确实是回本了，但是在 BNB狂热的时候，我也贪婪了，没有及时收割利润，加上 5.25 宣布的 7.15deadline，导致回吐很多。具体过程是怎样的呢，就是我在研究明白 mint 流之后，觉得这太香了，香到我有点冲昏头脑，然后有些母鞋没及时出手，想着多卖一点，或者多 mint 一次，然后忘记了风险，且没有做任何对冲。当然，部分利润，我去布局了 BSCPAD 和 STG，算是弥补了一点。\n\n教训三：风险控制第一，也就是管理好自己的仓位。先胜而后战，君子不立危墙之下。尤其是在家人参与的情况下，先回本，或者把风险控制在一个合适的范围（这个范围因人而异）。\n\n我最近其实看了很多复盘反思，也看到了一些原因比如是轻视，比如是自己懒，这种其实是给自己营造一种幻觉，你应该反思的不是这类原因，就像之前有人说这个错过了，我们去找下一个，那怎么就能保证下一个可以抓住？\n\n最近还看到，当我们每次危机之后回头看，市场其实给了我们很多次机会，尤其是几乎每一次大的危机出现之后，别的不说，就是 luna走向归零的那段时间，其实也让很多人赚了很多。但是问题来了，为什么大多数人危机是亏钱？\n\n### 接下来我的做法\n\n* 我对项目还是很看好，但是有很多事情我也无法决定。所以我的抉择会在月底左右。先说最差的情况，我也会保留创世、第一双万能、绿鞋以及空投的鞋子。\n* 每天继续走路，现在每天自己走完 40左右能量。继续听诸多音频，特别是财经类、历史类。\n* 看书、学习，继续研究新的项目。\n* 继续反思，看看Stepn 里的经验教训如何应用到下一个项目。\n\n### 关于对三类人的解读\n\n为了不引起误解，在这里先说明一下，第一类和第二类完全可能是重合的，即使真的没有重合，也没有对任何一类不敬的意思，我唯一希望大家不要做第三类人。\n\n关于第一类，作为成熟的投资者，这一类是大家努力成为的目标。昨天看了晓哥的总结，确实是一个很厉害的投资者。经晓哥允许，以下引用自晓哥的原话，在此表示感谢。\n\n> 我只是说，来这个市场，是为了赚钱的。想赚钱，心态就得开放。不要随意地贴上一个标签，简单地批判某个项目是什么骗局或空气。也不要简单地对某个项目有信仰，动不动就革命，理想，伟大，潜力。投资也不要太拘泥于所谓的正统，价值，投资或投机。也不要静态地去看一个项目，一个不看好的烂项目起点很差，但莫名其妙就做到市值很大，比如狗狗和屎币。有的明星项目分分钟就跨了，比如 EOS 和Luna 。形势变了，认知和决策马上跟着变。随时打脸，随时认错，随时跟进。\n\n> 想在市场上赚钱，思维的焦点其实根本不是给项目定一个性，它是革命还是骗局。而是类似于“它这个项目的成长逻辑是什么？”“有没有迎合行业的下一波炒作热点？”“里面有没有什么可赚钱的机会？”“风险有多大？”“应该建多少仓位?建仓的节奏怎么把握？”“建仓和减仓的触发条件是什么？”“出现什么信号我就应该跑多少仓位？”等等\n\n> 赚钱还是亏钱。不取决于这个项目的定性，而取决于你的对策。你说的死亡螺旋，走下坡路，或者之前很多人说的什么旁氏。其实都是一种认知。从认知到决策，有巨大的鸿沟。就拿大饼来说，不管看多大饼还是看空大饼，都同样有人赚到很多钱。这具体都是要看怎么做的。将思考的时间和焦点多放在对策上，而不是认知和预测上，赚钱的概率会更高。\n\n> 很多人投资的操作上实际是非常粗糙的，基本上就是看涨我就加仓，看跌我就减仓。项目好我就加仓，项目不好我就减仓清仓。他的操作全部建立在对于涨跌和项目好坏的预测上，所以会在选币和择时上耗费大量的功夫。问题在于，涨跌和选币本身就是充满高度的不确定性的，投入更多的资源和时间并不一定能消除这种不确定性。这也就是很多人炒币吃不香睡不踏实的原因，减仓怕踏空，加仓怕被套。这是个无底洞。真正的解决方案可能得把短板补一补，考虑一下怎样将投资决策建立在这种不确定性的基础上，就是我预测行情涨跌可能是错的，选币也经常会看走眼的，那么这个概率有多大，风险几何。怎样才能控制这个风险敞口，获得风险收益。\n\n关于第二类，在我总结之前，先插播一个小故事。大家应该都度过《明朝那些事儿》，其中对我震撼最大的一段是\n\n> **这就是我想通过徐霞客所表达的，足以藐视所有王侯将相，最完美的结束语：成功只有一个——按照自己的方式，去度过人生。**\n\n这段时间快走(jogger)的时候，听了很多音频，特别是历史类的音频，感想颇多，我们到底从历史中学会了什么？为什么一些事情还是一再重复发生？还是因为我们都是不能超越自己的欲望和弱点。\n\n> 无论这个世界有多绝望，你自己都要充满希望。\n\n> 人生并非如某些人所说，很短暂，事实上，有时候，它很漫长，特别是对苦难中的人，漫长得想死。\n\n> 但我坚持，无论有多绝望，无论有多悲哀，每天早上起来，都要对自己说，这个世界很好，很强大。\n\n> 这句话，不是在满怀希望光明时说的，很绝望、很无助、很痛苦、很迷茫的时候，说这句话。\n\n> 要坚信，你是一个勇敢的人。\n\n> 因为你还活着，活着，就要继续前进。\n\n以上，转自《明朝那些事儿》，送给 Stepn，送给还在坚持的 Stepn 小伙伴，送给自己。", "timestamp": 1654768544, "digest": "SMaU6qBuvBbzlsmcjqZF_NxI14ZWhHlaj_E2DP3hGY4", "contributor": "0xDdd54D4D71FF9AD625D8e90DC6DdEafEeB5632Ba"}

I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654768937, "digest": "58-fqpvgoNOVx14Dui5jokK6gmjACcJW9i_mrd61FTw", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}
{"id": "IoMuaIi4xrM2BkMRxwPOgY49S9RFF7NP4Z6VsIIQxx0", "title": "踏入 NFT 的“后现代主义”：ill poop it nft和 ShitBeast", "body": "截止到2022年6月8日，ill poop it nft和ShitBeast已经占据了OpenSea的七天交易量的第7名和第8名。ill poop it nft和ShitBeast均出自同一团队，他们所打造的shit系列到底带来了怎样的市场影响，爆火背后的原因又是什么呢？\n\n![7日NFT交易量排行榜（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aHIN7jismzhw9tRgcpaJ9.png?height=876&width=1280)\n\n## 市场影响\n\n### 起源\n\n6月1日，项目方发行了 **ill poop it nft**，总量10,000个，采用free mint的形式**。**该NFT画风极其另类，元素主体为一坨屎，并带有其他NFT的照片。同时，左上角还挂着一块招牌，上面写着一些极具嘲讽的话语，如“Fucking interviews still going on in Web 3 huh?”。该社区没有Discord，仅有Twitter进行关键信息的发布，路线图上也是开玩笑的段子，所以一眼看去像是一个蹭流量的项目，一开始大家也只是在社交媒体上调侃市场上出现“一坨屎的NFT”。\n\n![ ill poop it nft展示图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iedmxRM9XmqL-qXbmuo5t.png?height=317&width=1280)\n\n### ill poop it nft\n\n在开放free mint后，**ill poop it nft** 地板价一路涨到了 0.28e，之后开始逐渐下跌，并在6月4号最低跌到0.015e，跌幅高达94%。正当大家都以为这只是一个昙花一现的项目时，6月5号 ill poop it nft 地板价再次拉升到0.37e，并在6月6号突破新高达到了0.57e。\n\n![ill poop it nft 价格走势图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rMLRtQsfJ47H9ZrTBKvuz.png?height=428&width=1280)\n\n从下图流通量上我们可以看出，6月1号和6月5号是该NFT交易的密集期；结合持有者和交易者的情况，我们发现ill poop it nft在6月5号经过了大量换手，目前交易量逐渐放缓，售卖者也开始大幅变少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mn6tiPhjDb6ixt1GOnMth.png?height=452&width=1280)\n\n### ShitBeast\n\n与此同时，官方推出的第二代NFT ShitBeast开始接替ill poop it nft的成交量，并在6月6日冲到日内交易量第二位，仅次于BAYC。\n\n![ ill poop it nft和ShitBeast交易量对比图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yi6CovGSleDmwROXOhEj8.png?height=579&width=1280)\n\nShitBeast的地板价自发售以来一直在逐步爬升，从6月5日的mint价格0.06e涨到6月8日的0.59e，涨幅已经高达883%，最高一笔以8.88e成交。\n\n![ShitBeast地板价走势图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xvU9ZXlnXT7yJKVSSQenq.png?height=434&width=1280)\n\n在持有人方面，ShitBeast的巨鲸持有人逐渐增多。目前蓝筹持有人为317个，其中224人为Other deed持有者占总比例的6.04%，相比之下，第一代ill poop it nft 的蓝筹持有人为148个，其中Otherdeed持有者占到7.02%，同一个项目的发行第二代NFT的蓝筹持有人比第一代更多。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3IYqfMcmG5T3hjKGf4ILg.png?height=518&width=1049)\n\n![蓝筹持有人及比例（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/blSzVFeWJsQIl1YMblrUj.png?height=547&width=1052)\n\n![ShitBeast前5名的收益均在$100,000以上（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fP0ApEAn2EbYHkhupVej0.png?height=398&width=1280)\n\n### ShitPlunger\n\n此外，6月7号项目方空投给Genesis ShitBeast的ShitPlunger，采用了ERC1155协议，发售后不到24小时价格涨到了0.478e，目前交易量也在逐步上升，并保持比较活跃的状态。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5fu_RDS7MtyEYmx6W3Y8.png?height=579&width=777)\n\n![ShitPlunger交易信息（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DslwBNOPJ5z3bYbSV6Quo.png?height=426&width=1280)\n\n# 推动价格的原因\n\n从上文可知，6月5号是交易的密集区，我们回到这一天，项目方开放了官网，宣布进入第二阶段，并公布了第二代NFT——ShitBeast。\n\n### 通缩\n\n从官方透露的信息可以知道该ShitBeast分为两个级别。第一种为Genesis ShitBeast，共3095个，用户可以选择将两个ill poop it nft合成一个Genesis ShitBeast；第二种是普通级别的ShitBeast，共6095个，用户可以在官网直接mint，价格为0.06e。\n\n按照Genesis ShitBeast全部合成计算下来，将需要销毁6190个ill poop it nft，因此ill poop it nft数量会越来越少，这可能就是ill poop it nft价格急速拉升的第一个原因。\n\n### 空投\n\n由两个ill poop it nft合成的Genesis ShitBeast还可以获得10,000,00,000的$SHIT空投。没错，距离第一代NFT发行不到一周，除了增发第二代NFT，他们甚至又发行了ERC 20的$SHIT，并上线了MEXC交易所，$SHIT又是一波价格的拉升，这直接引起了人们的大范围讨论，引爆了相关话题。\n\n![$SHIT价格走势图（数据来源：mexc.com）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mMCkNhRraUY7wQiI3p0Sq.png?height=665&width=1280)\n\n### 再次通缩\n\n6月5号，官方推特再次暗示将发行名为ShitPlunger的NFT，并公布了新的玩法，称通过ShitPlunger，人们可以将他们的ShitBeast进化成第三代NFT，ShitPlunger有两种方式可以获得，一是拥有Genesis ShitBeast将直接获得ShitPlunger空投，二是通过$SHIT可以进行购买ShitPlunger。不仅为没有合成ShitBeast的poop提供了新的赋能，引发fomo情绪，也为第二代 ShitBeast 创造了通缩机制，同时$SHIT也具有了购买力，完成了一次赋能，可谓一箭三雕。\n\n![ShitDeployer发售的NFT（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j6ocU0E8e3WlvCn487Nfa.png?height=579&width=1280)\n\n### 运营特点\n\n从项目方发布的信息，我们可以看出整个系列分为三个阶段，并对应发布三种NFT，即第一代ill poop it nft、第二代ShitBeast，第三代尚未得知，在推特上我们发现这样一幅图——项目方暗示即将到来的第三代NFT。从画风中，该NFT很明显是“Shit→ShitBeast→ShitMan”的养成路线，项目方在每个阶段之间用通缩的机制进行串联，比如：2个ill poop it nft→1个ShitBeast，1个ShitBeast+1个ShitPlunger→1个ShitMan。这样持有人将自己的老NFT不断换为新NFT，完成价值转移，而老NFT则会通过销毁变得稀缺。\n\n![Shit→ShitBeast→ShitMan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sAbEL58pP48NdFtxZiI4d.png?height=448&width=1456)\n\n除此之外，项目方在不停和其他NFT进行联动，比如在Murakami.Flowers将要空投时发布推文，暗示持有ill poop it nft和Murakami.Flowers将会有$SHIT空投，基本上延续了ill poop it nft的“碰瓷”文化，推特的运营则把一些知名的NFT都当做自己的引流对象，不停地进行引用和讽刺，在文案和图画制作上也比较有针对性，来引起人们的情绪共鸣。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BTeXTeb5Fn2QCIVEqQojh.png?height=1072&width=1174)\n\n![一些推文（来源：Twitter）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C41DeGDLIdVWxkJwXCvVu.png?height=855&width=956)\n\n除了风格，我们看到项目方的行动非常专业且迅速，短短七天发布3个系列的NFT，并熟练应用ERC20、ERC721、ERC1155来配合不同的运营路径，不仅通过激励留住了早期持有者，也不断地开放入口让新人可以找到自己的参与的方式。\n\n# NFT的后现代主义\n\n在某种程度上，艺术，文学，音乐是互通的，而处于一个新兴赛道的 NFT 的，其发展无形中走过了“现实主义”，“现代主义”，再到如今的“后现代主义”阶段。\n\n在 NFT 早期阶段，NFT 的发展依旧依托于艺术和艺术家本身，着眼于艺术所塑造和刻画的本质，比如Beeple。慢慢地，随着 BAYC，Doodles等项目的诞生，NFT成为创作，身份和社区的多种代表，而部分人在交易的同时依旧关注其实用性，路线图，社区价值和美学精神。但同时，NFT PFP的热潮不乏代表了一种属于21世纪的反叛精神和运动。\n\n而如今，随着ill poop it nft和Goblin.wtf等项目的出现，NFT 本身更有一种自我否定，讽刺和质疑的精神。加之当前的市场行情，审美的维度得到了重述，人们用奇怪符号和简单的形式进行自我表达。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hao-EKMSuIkmJOWRH1Ogm.png?height=506&width=1201)\n\n“Your NFT is just a piece of shit.”这背后或许说明了，NFT其实没有任何使命和实用，只是大家的集体消遣。所有一切都是转瞬即逝的，虚无的，就像是你手中的 NFT。\n\n# 结语\n\n熊市到了现在，市场突然涌现出一批以“丑、恶、怪”为特点的NFT，这样一股“泥石流”的冲击，不禁让人们怀疑NFT的价值到底与何种共识对应，也许是因为人们对于目前市场的不满，大部分NFT都处于亏损的状态，这时poop NFT对一些NFT的讽刺正好引起了人们共鸣，存在着一部分情绪上的共识。随着ShitDeployer不停地升级玩法，屠龙少年是否也会成为恶龙呢？让我们持续观察。", "timestamp": 1654768938, "digest": "icQORRTfSP-M5DVbIkM0ZomIr9YGmes8iQ0ShmOn_Ag", "contributor":

I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654768969, "digest": "58-fqpvgoNOVx14Dui5jokK6gmjACcJW9i_mrd61FTw", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}

{"id": "GtbIuBj-dXB4iD2f2_EJF9xU3sWk38Yvd5PvzIHLSxs", "title": "踏入 NFT 的“后现代主义”：ill poop it nft和 ShitBeast", "body": "截止到2022年6月8日，ill poop it nft和ShitBeast已经占据了OpenSea的七天交易量的第7名和第8名。ill poop it nft和ShitBeast均出自同一团队，他们所打造的shit系列到底带来了怎样的市场影响，爆火背后的原因又是什么呢？\n\n![7日NFT交易量排行榜（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aHIN7jismzhw9tRgcpaJ9.png?height=876&width=1280)\n\n## 市场影响\n\n### 起源\n\n6月1日，项目方发行了 **ill poop it nft**，总量10,000个，采用free mint的形式\\*\\*。\\*\\*该NFT画风极其另类，元素主体为一坨屎，并带有其他NFT的照片。同时，左上角还挂着一块招牌，上面写着一些极具嘲讽的话语，如“Fucking interviews still going on in Web 3 huh?”。该社区没有Discord，仅有Twitter进行关键信息的发布，路线图上也是开玩笑的段子，所以一眼看去像是一个蹭流量的项目，一开始大家也只是在社交媒体上调侃市场上出现“一坨屎的NFT”。\n\n![ ill poop it nft展示图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iedmxRM9XmqL-qXbmuo5t.png?height=317&width=1280)\n\n### ill poop it nft\n\n在开放free mint后，**ill poop it nft** 地板价一路涨到了 0.28e，之后开始逐渐下跌，并在6月4号最低跌到0.015e，跌幅高达94%。正当大家都以为这只是一个昙花一现的项目时，6月5号 ill poop it nft 地板价再次拉升到0.37e，并在6月6号突破新高达到了0.57e。\n\n![ill poop it nft 价格走势图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rMLRtQsfJ47H9ZrTBKvuz.png?height=428&width=1280)\n\n从下图流通量上我们可以看出，6月1号和6月5号是该NFT交易的密集期；结合持有者和交易者的情况，我们发现ill poop it nft在6月5号经过了大量换手，目前交易量逐渐放缓，售卖者也开始大幅变少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mn6tiPhjDb6ixt1GOnMth.png?height=452&width=1280)\n\n### ShitBeast\n\n与此同时，官方推出的第二代NFT ShitBeast开始接替ill poop it nft的成交量，并在6月6日冲到日内交易量第二位，仅次于BAYC。\n\n![ ill poop it nft和ShitBeast交易量对比图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yi6CovGSleDmwROXOhEj8.png?height=579&width=1280)\n\nShitBeast的地板价自发售以来一直在逐步爬升，从6月5日的mint价格0.06e涨到6月8日的0.59e，涨幅已经高达883%，最高一笔以8.88e成交。\n\n![ShitBeast地板价走势图（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xvU9ZXlnXT7yJKVSSQenq.png?height=434&width=1280)\n\n在持有人方面，ShitBeast的巨鲸持有人逐渐增多。目前蓝筹持有人为317个，其中224人为Other deed持有者占总比例的6.04%，相比之下，第一代ill poop it nft 的蓝筹持有人为148个，其中Otherdeed持有者占到7.02%，同一个项目的发行第二代NFT的蓝筹持有人比第一代更多。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3IYqfMcmG5T3hjKGf4ILg.png?height=518&width=1049)\n\n![蓝筹持有人及比例（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/blSzVFeWJsQIl1YMblrUj.png?height=547&width=1052)\n\n![ShitBeast前5名的收益均在$100,000以上（来源：NFTGo.io）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fP0ApEAn2EbYHkhupVej0.png?height=398&width=1280)\n\n### ShitPlunger\n\n此外，6月7号项目方空投给Genesis ShitBeast的ShitPlunger，采用了ERC1155协议，发售后不到24小时价格涨到了0.478e，目前交易量也在逐步上升，并保持比较活跃的状态。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5fu_RDS7MtyEYmx6W3Y8.png?height=579&width=777)\n\n![ShitPlunger交易信息（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DslwBNOPJ5z3bYbSV6Quo.png?height=426&width=1280)\n\n# 推动价格的原因\n\n从上文可知，6月5号是交易的密集区，我们回到这一天，项目方开放了官网，宣布进入第二阶段，并公布了第二代NFT——ShitBeast。\n\n### 通缩\n\n从官方透露的信息可以知道该ShitBeast分为两个级别。第一种为Genesis ShitBeast，共3095个，用户可以选择将两个ill poop it nft合成一个Genesis ShitBeast；第二种是普通级别的ShitBeast，共6095个，用户可以在官网直接mint，价格为0.06e。\n\n按照Genesis ShitBeast全部合成计算下来，将需要销毁6190个ill poop it nft，因此ill poop it nft数量会越来越少，这可能就是ill poop it nft价格急速拉升的第一个原因。\n\n### 空投\n\n由两个ill poop it nft合成的Genesis ShitBeast还可以获得10,000,00,000的$SHIT空投。没错，距离第一代NFT发行不到一周，除了增发第二代NFT，他们甚至又发行了ERC 20的$SHIT，并上线了MEXC交易所，$SHIT又是一波价格的拉升，这直接引起了人们的大范围讨论，引爆了相关话题。\n\n![$SHIT价格走势图（数据来源：mexc.com）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mMCkNhRraUY7wQiI3p0Sq.png?height=665&width=1280)\n\n### 再次通缩\n\n6月5号，官方推特再次暗示将发行名为ShitPlunger的NFT，并公布了新的玩法，称通过ShitPlunger，人们可以将他们的ShitBeast进化成第三代NFT，ShitPlunger有两种方式可以获得，一是拥有Genesis ShitBeast将直接获得ShitPlunger空投，二是通过$SHIT可以进行购买ShitPlunger。不仅为没有合成ShitBeast的poop提供了新的赋能，引发fomo情绪，也为第二代 ShitBeast 创造了通缩机制，同时$SHIT也具有了购买力，完成了一次赋能，可谓一箭三雕。\n\n![ShitDeployer发售的NFT（来源：OpenSea）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j6ocU0E8e3WlvCn487Nfa.png?height=579&width=1280)\n\n### 运营特点\n\n从项目方发布的信息，我们可以看出整个系列分为三个阶段，并对应发布三种NFT，即第一代ill poop it nft、第二代ShitBeast，第三代尚未得知，在推特上我们发现这样一幅图——项目方暗示即将到来的第三代NFT。从画风中，该NFT很明显是“Shit→ShitBeast→ShitMan”的养成路线，项目方在每个阶段之间用通缩的机制进行串联，比如：2个ill poop it nft→1个ShitBeast，1个ShitBeast+1个ShitPlunger→1个ShitMan。这样持有人将自己的老NFT不断换为新NFT，完成价值转移，而老NFT则会通过销毁变得稀缺。\n\n![Shit→ShitBeast→ShitMan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sAbEL58pP48NdFtxZiI4d.png?height=448&width=1456)\n\n除此之外，项目方在不停和其他NFT进行联动，比如在Murakami.Flowers将要空投时发布推文，暗示持有ill poop it nft和Murakami.Flowers将会有$SHIT空投，基本上延续了ill poop it nft的“碰瓷”文化，推特的运营则把一些知名的NFT都当做自己的引流对象，不停地进行引用和讽刺，在文案和图画制作上也比较有针对性，来引起人们的情绪共鸣。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BTeXTeb5Fn2QCIVEqQojh.png?height=1072&width=1174)\n\n![一些推文（来源：Twitter）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C41DeGDLIdVWxkJwXCvVu.png?height=855&width=956)\n\n除了风格，我们看到项目方的行动非常专业且迅速，短短七天发布3个系列的NFT，并熟练应用ERC20、ERC721、ERC1155来配合不同的运营路径，不仅通过激励留住了早期持有者，也不断地开放入口让新人可以找到自己的参与的方式。\n\n# NFT的后现代主义\n\n在某种程度上，艺术，文学，音乐是互通的，而处于一个新兴赛道的 NFT 的，其发展无形中走过了“现实主义”，“现代主义”，再到如今的“后现代主义”阶段。\n\n在 NFT 早期阶段，NFT 的发展依旧依托于艺术和艺术家本身，着眼于艺术所塑造和刻画的本质，比如Beeple。慢慢地，随着 BAYC，Doodles等项目的诞生，NFT成为创作，身份和社区的多种代表，而部分人在交易的同时依旧关注其实用性，路线图，社区价值和美学精神。但同时，NFT PFP的热潮不乏代表了一种属于21世纪的反叛精神和运动。\n\n而如今，随着ill poop it nft和Goblin.wtf等项目的出现，NFT 本身更有一种自我否定，讽刺和质疑的精神。加之当前的市场行情，审美的维度得到了重述，人们用奇怪符号和简单的形式进行自我表达。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hao-EKMSuIkmJOWRH1Ogm.png?height=506&width=1201)\n\n“Your NFT is just a piece of shit.”这背后或许说明了，NFT其实没有任何使命和实用，只是大家的集体消遣。所有一切都是转瞬即逝的，虚无的，就像是你手中的 NFT。\n\n# 结语\n\n熊市到了现在，市场突然涌现出一批以“丑、恶、怪”为特点的NFT，这样一股“泥石流”的冲击，不禁让人们怀疑NFT的价值到底与何种共识对应，也许是因为人们对于目前市场的不满，大部分NFT都处于亏损的状态，这时poop NFT对一些NFT的讽刺正好引起了人们共鸣，存在着一部分情绪上的共识。随着ShitDeployer不停地升级玩法，屠龙少年是否也会成为恶龙呢？让我们持续观察。\n\n*Note：本文仅供研究使用，观点和意见仅代表作者个人，并不一定反映或代表NFTGo.io的观点和意见。投资数字资产（如NFT和数字资产）会有风险，在做出任何投资决定前，请务必咨询财务顾问。NFTGo不提供投资建议，不对任何因投资数字资产造成的损失负责。*\n\n

{"id": "-8Or5cnpgI1ah2druIrfaQ0KuTCCysGrh6U_euffC4U", "title": "In Process with Strange Cintia", "body": "[edition://0xd6F704EDB5B41109A66a04D5E8306FF6Ec5F1127?editionId=0](edition://0xd6F704EDB5B41109A66a04D5E8306FF6Ec5F1127?editionId=0)\n\nI, JL Maxcy, am the type of person to leave early for every appointment. I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below.

The content of this article is not investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product. Always DYOR.*\n\n## Introduction\n\nBTCDayu and Lanxing, the moderators of X2Y2, raised 14 serious questions about X2Y2. An investor in the crypto market is not strange to DYOR. The meaning behind that is to be rational and responsible for every investment decision you made, and minimize the negative impact of emotion as much as possible. Lanxing answered the questions frankly with true data support will be a great example of DYOR. Let’s dive deep into the questions: \n\n## 1. What is the profit model of X2Y2? What is the daily trading fee income? How much ETH can I share daily with 100k X2Y2 tokens staking? How much is for the team?\n\nLanxing:\n\nX2Y2, an NFT exchange platform similar to Opensea, profits from charging trading fees to NFT traders. The fee rate in June 2022 is 0.5%, meaning a seller pays 0.5e if his NFT worth of 100e is sold on X2Y2.\n\nWe can check the daily trading fee data directly from [Dune](https://dune.com/votan/X2Y2-NFT-Marketplace) or [NFTscan](https://www.nftscan.com/analytics/marketplace), collecting trading volume data and multiplying it by 0.5%. We can see a range between 60e to 90e as the average daily trading fee X2Y2 is calming, and the 7-day average is 72e, equal to 130k USD per day.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OyH9kyYqXkZ_0BpRQmfki.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe fee is 100% distributed to X2Y2 token holders (who are staking), including the ILO (Initial Liquidity Offer) participants. Therefore, how much you can share depends on the percentage of how many tokens you are staking verse the total staking amount and then multiplies by daily fees. According to the data from Dune, the total number of staking tokens is around 232M and 70e daily fee income now, and thus **you can share around 0.03e daily for every 100k tokens staked**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uty7kraNg_o8lvms4umjT.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nTake the no. 1 holder as an example. The address is staking more than 30M X2Y2 tokens and earns 5e - 9e daily.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FOigZAU2UD2knr6UV60wl.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAccording to the official document of [tokenomics](https://docs.x2y2.io/tokens/tokenomics), the total supply is 1B. 90M tokens, initially for the airdrop purpose, were burned, and thus the current supply is around 910M. The team and treasury are allocated 100M tokens (10%), respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3vZ__YwuaFuKwTIU1K3QM.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe team’s portion is locked, and the token will linearly unlock 1/4 (2.5% of total supply) in another 180 days after 180 days. It also shares a cut from the market fee from day one but does not share the staking rewards.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z0lKFjZPBRGcK6isip7Lw.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe graph below shows how the fees are distributed (You can monitor them [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2?a=0xf704353b5c98577d3b4274614e62fc79676d33bd)). The total fee was 87e yesterday. The team, the treasury, ILO participants, and the staking holders were allocated 17e, 14.73e, 3.3e, and 51.55e, respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pxOChJhJSjIikq0c6qruU.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 2. X2Y2’s tokenomics is similar to LOOKS’s. Why is Dayu more optimistic about the one weaker in performance? Is that true that 10% tokens allocation is on the team? (Important: This is the crucial question to differentiate Value investing from the Ponzi scheme)\n\nLanxing:\n\nX2Y2 genuinely distributes the trading fees to token holders, with no pre-staking, market making, or competing with stakeholders. The team reacts quickly to the market and has published bulk purchases, bulk listing, and community-driven marketing. The founder (TP) keeps collecting advice from the community in the DC group and replies in person.\n\nAs for LOOKS, you can refer to [this article](https://bitcoinist.com/looksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens/). LOOKS’s team transacted 50% of its staking reward to cryptocurrency tumblers by controlling the market; this is an act of sacrificing LOOKS’s retail investors and destroying community trust, not to mention there was a pre-staking mechanism for private offers (a big halve of benefit to latecomers!).\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1490747114204368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1490747114204368898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flooksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens%2F](https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1490747114204368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1490747114204368898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flooksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens%2F)\n\nThe 30-day price chart of X2Y2 and LOOKS are shown below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQUpAgGnFmEaB82VXCfMA.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gesNw0SCw75ARNET3bw8.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nBAYC community is active in LOOKS’s private offers, and among them, many are KOLs which puts LOOKS in an advantageous position. **But it is worth noticing that the Otherdeed collection is traded in volumes of 34k e and 44k e in LOOKS and X2Y2, respectively.**\n\nThe trading volume of new projects on X2Y2 has already surpassed that of LOOKS’s, while the active daily user on X2Y2 is three times of LOOKS’s.\n\nThe performance of X2Y2 on price also outperforms in a downtrend bear market. The two competitors will collide in price within two months to think optimistically.\n\n## 3. What is X2Y2’s emission schedule? How about the selling pressure in the future? What is the MC now? How its data look like compared with other projects?\n\nLanxing:\n\nWe can see the emission schedule below or have more details [here](https://mirror.xyz/x2y2.eth).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BZ6s6U2WNbUNUL72jR10-.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAs mentioned above, the total supply now is less than 910M X2Y2. Tokens owned by the team and treasury (200M) are not in the circulating supply but are collecting the fees. The unlocking schedule of the team and treasury’s token is shown below. X2Y2 was launched on 2 Feb, the 1st treasury unlocked was in May, and the 1st unlock of the team’s token will be in August.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wb8osp7QQOwtvWHgWcOFG.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWe then talk about [X2Y2 Tokenomics 2.0](https://mirror.xyz/x2y2.eth/k2Bv3UMpNFJTJiYdf5m48sANHn-Ei3m6ohmkO29qeoU).\n\n624,902 X2Y2 tokens are distributed to both seller and buyer daily. 604,902 tokens are for selling incentive, while 20,000 is for purchase incentive.\n\nThere was a mistake in setting the initial parameters of the staking rewards contract. The error resulted in per stage having, instead of the intended per block halving, ended up distributing 56% of the total 200M rewards in the first 30 days instead of the 18% initially intended.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Y6Q1YfX6lZaJlIAqeaa7.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n4500M X2Y2 tokens are allocated for trading rewards, releasing 624,902 tokens every day from 15 Feb.\n\n15M ILO tokens are linearly unlocked and can be neglected.\n\n597,790.8 tokens are allocated for the staking pool. 91.7% of tokens now (\\~2327M tokens) are in the pool.\n\nCurrently, the selling pressure is mainly from the trading rewards. Despite 70% of the trading volume being from wash trading (for the token rebate), the actual volume is still more than 10% of Opensea’s.\n\n**Therefore, the foreseeable future selling pressure shall be due to the deductions of trading rewards and staking rewards. The staking holders are more likely to observe the growth rate of users and daily trading fees income to decide what is next.**\n\nSee below for X2Y2’s circulating supply:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NNRepp6FSd3gpji-OtPax.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 4. Are the late comers of X2Y2 the money-printer of the early birds? If not, how much emission is from staking? Is the trading volume high enough to support the profit model? What will the emission schedule look like in the future?\n\nLanxing：\n\nX2Y2 is not a Ponzi scheme since there are actual trading fees as profit to support. Token holders who are staking are rewarded X2Y2 and share WETH from trading fees. The business model is akin to a royalty business but shares dividends every day instead of quarterly.\n\n**The current staking APY is 93.1%, trading fee APY is 61.2%.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jp2pySGwn16L90acx7l8N.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nFor inquiry on trading volume, please refer to question 1.\n\nFor the token emission schedule, please refer to question 3.\n\n## 5. How about the team and dev? Do they have a broad vision? Do they have executive power? Have the product developed on schedule? How is the user experience?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. TP, the founder, has a background in IT with sincere characteristics and listens to the community. You are free to come to our DC and will see TP actively responds here and is highly open-minded to constructive suggestions.\n2. The slogan of X2Y2 is “By the people, for the people.” Although the team made a mistake in setting the initial parameters of the staking rewards contract, the team found no excuse for the problem nor escaped from the questioning but organized AMA to answer the community’s worry instead. The team members slept for only 3 hours per day in the first month X2Y2 was born. We can see now that X2Y2 has formed partnerships with multiple NFT tools, including GEM, GENIE, TRAIT SNIPER, RARITY SNIPER, etc., Not to mention BENDDAO in the coming future. Besides, there are connections with other NFT communities. For instance, a strategic partnership was made with the NFT Alpha community, and Trait Sniper's CEO came to our AMA in person.\n3. The energy of the team is also high. X2Y2 is the first in the DAO NFT sector developing functions of bulk purchase, collection offers, and bulk listing. You can check the status of X2Y2’s development by clicking the link below.\n\n[https://www.notion.so/e503954ad1c44e018f956a04a0770713](https://www.notion.so/e503954ad1c44e018f956a04a0770713)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zn-XMrgaQlmjCa75laGmh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nMany users appreciate X2Y2 for its extra-low fee on trading and smooth user experience.\n\n@0x0nassis, who has more than 105k followers on Twitter, publicly admires X2Y2.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e4R5bzksXFPKpjJP_l70o.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nRecently free mint is the trend, and people can save a ton of trading fees simply by using the user-friendly X2Y2 exchange, as said in the real user experience below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Bj8ix0kWPFwtbvk0y2Xs.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nResearch institutions, including Delphi, have already mentioned X2Y2 twice.\n\n[https://twitter.com/x2y2cn/status/1532225099901767680/photo/1](https://twitter.com/x2y2cn/status/1532225099901767680/photo/1)\n\n**Active daily user pumping from 100 in Feb to a stable number of over 6000 now** is the best evidence showing how user-friendly X2Y2 is from the users’ perspective. At least, we can be so proud of saying our server does not go down often like Opensea.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TAHYwcTjEZRGngxurJFqM.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 6. Will exchange be a vital part of the NFT market?\n\nOf course. The need for exchanging is one kind of inelastic demand.\n\n## 7.  Where is the fund supporting the team’s development without being able to use the allocated tokens? Is there any plan for partnerships with VCs? Wen BN?\n\nLanxing：\n\nInitially, the development fund came from the team’s pocket, and part of it now comes from the share of the trading fee. It is worth mentioning that X2Y2 spends almost nothing on marketing since the community takes the initiative to handle this part.\n\nPartnership with VCs is on our list, and we will announce details at the right moment. **We think the resources a VC could bring are more critical to the financial support.**\n\nX2Y2 is already listed on MEXC, and **some big exchanges are also approaching us.**\n\n## 8. What is the technical background of the team? Is there any product made before as a track record? Are the media supporting us?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. Most of them are from the IT industry and haven’t disclosed any product developed before yet. I can tell that they are all experts on blockchain tech with successful experience in exchanges.\n2. Foresight News (founded by a former ChainNews member), Wincrypto, and ChainCatcher are all publishing news about X2Y2.\n\n## 9. How comes the price drop from 4.5U to 0.2U?\n\nLanxing：\n\nPrice follows the supply-and-demand theory.\n\nThe initial price was 0.5U and pumped to 4.5U for only two days. The team did not manipulate the market. The market was so hype because, on the one hand, investors were affected by emotion (since many Chinese KOL twitted about it), and some were trying to make a profit by using this hype (by pushing the price to a great altitude and dumping it at a high price). Also, the extra-high staking APY attracted people to be part of us.\n\nHowever, that is not the whole story.\n\nFirst, the result of changing people’s behavior with tokenomics 1.0 did not meet our original expectations. Still, it attracted those who wanted to make profits with the mechanism instead (I am totally fine with this behavior since this is part of the market). 200M tokens were prepared for listing rewards and were proportional related to the listing period; thus, most of the listings were low liquidity/ hard to sell, so they could generate more listing rewards. This was not what we wanted! No trading, no profit. The team then modified the listing reward mechanism several times during that period and kept developing new functions.\n\nThe mistake of the emission schedule also contributes to the drop. Initially, there should be 1.23M tokens released daily, but they ended up being 3.7M tokens instead (Question 2). The APY was super high in the first month (10,000%) and became colossal selling pressure later.\n\nThirdly, newbies, who did not understand Defi but were optimistic about the NFT market, might buy the tokens in FOMO and be scared off by the drop.\n\nThe trading volume of the X2Y2 token was more than 10M daily during that period. Most of the selling was from staking and listing rewards, and the buying force was insufficient. More importantly, our NFT trading volume did not benefit from the incentives, and thus investors were reluctant to get into X2Y2 anymore.\n\n**However, it is worth mentioning that if someone buys 100k tokens at 1U and stakes, the number of tokens now becomes around 350k. Plus the share of trading fees, the investment is already in profit in ETH-standard and can exchange for more ETH than he paid.**\n\nDuring the sudden drop, the community was overwhelmed with pessimistic emotion, especially ILO participants. There were also complaints from KOL. The team was lacking sleep too. After that, TP initiated several AMA and promised to change the situation with execution. The team believed that the only way out was to attract the actual NFT traders, so the platform can start making profits to stabilize the price. Therefore, we waved the trading fee (0%) in April, compensated the gas fee with daily 620k X2Y2 tokens, canceled the listing rewards, burned the 92M unclaimed tokens, and publicized the status of development (question 5). We found this was working and continued promotion in May, charging only a 0.5% fee on trading. The Otherdeed was hot in the month, and its trading volume on X2Y2 excesses more than 10k e. This is how X2Y2 has become the second biggest NFT exchange.\n\nWe organized an X2Y2 volunteering group in early March starting with only several people. And now, we can see from the Twitter, Wechat group, DC, etc., are promoting X2Y2. X2Y2 now has over 6k daily active users and 72e average daily trading fee income. The income is based on a 0.5% trading fee rate still, which will be 360e daily if the rate is the same as Opensea (2.5%).\n\n## 10. A token’s value capture is essential. Is there any benefit to holding X2Y2 tokens? What is the forecast in optimistic and pessimistic cases?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. Holding X2Y2 tokens means you have the right to share trading fees and staking rewards.\n2. To evaluate X2Y2 needs to take many aspects into account. The fact now is that there are only 2M ERC addresses that are active NFT traders, and 1,500 among them are whales. The market capitalization of NFT is just 26B. Compared to the total 54.38M ETH holders, the room for growth in the NFT market is enormous.\n3. If we want to know if the growth rate of trading volume and the daily active user is fast enough and if X2Y2 has moats and effective promotion strategies, we need to count on competitors.\n\nThe valuation of Opensea now is $13B. Since X2Y2’s daily user and net trading volume has already exceeded 10% of Opensea, giving X2Y2 a valuation of $1.3B seems fair.\n\nPessimistically or in the short term, I may start to buy and stake the tokens when it drops to $0.15U.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kF4WegCb5YKHfIevbZ94x.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 11. If the profit model of LOOKS trying to reward wash trading is a kind of Ponzi scheme, why are X2Y2’s staking and trading rewards different from that? How is the model different from projects like FCOIN? Will the latecomers be the money printer for the early birds?\n\nLanxing：\n\nThis question is answered in Question 2. To understand the differences, you also need to clarify what a Ponzi scheme is. Having income from outer layer sources like X2Y2’s profit model is not a Ponzi scheme.\n\n**Questions raised by Lanxing：**\n\n## 12.

The content of this article is not investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product. Always DYOR.*\n\n## Introduction\n\nBTCDayu and Lanxing, the moderators of X2Y2, raised 14 serious questions about X2Y2. An investor in the crypto market is not strange to DYOR. The meaning behind that is to be rational and responsible for every investment decision you made, and minimize the negative impact of emotion as much as possible. Lanxing answered the questions frankly with true data support will be a great example of DYOR. Let’s dive deep into the questions: \n\n## 1. What is the profit model of X2Y2? What is the daily trading fee income? How much ETH can I share daily with 100k X2Y2 tokens staking? How much is for the team?\n\nLanxing:\n\nX2Y2, an NFT exchange platform similar to Opensea, profits from charging trading fees to NFT traders. The fee rate in June 2022 is 0.5%, meaning a seller pays 0.5e if his NFT worth of 100e is sold on X2Y2.\n\nWe can check the daily trading fee data directly from [Dune](https://dune.com/votan/X2Y2-NFT-Marketplace) or [NFTscan](https://www.nftscan.com/analytics/marketplace), collecting trading volume data and multiplying it by 0.5%. We can see a range between 60e to 90e as the average daily trading fee X2Y2 is calming, and the 7-day average is 72e, equal to 130k USD per day.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OyH9kyYqXkZ_0BpRQmfki.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe fee is 100% distributed to X2Y2 token holders (who are staking), including the ILO (Initial Liquidity Offer) participants. Therefore, how much you can share depends on the percentage of how many tokens you are staking verse the total staking amount and then multiplies by daily fees. According to the data from Dune, the total number of staking tokens is around 232M and 70e daily fee income now, and thus **you can share around 0.03e daily for every 100k tokens staked**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uty7kraNg_o8lvms4umjT.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nTake the no. 1 holder as an example. The address is staking more than 30M X2Y2 tokens and earns 5e - 9e daily.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FOigZAU2UD2knr6UV60wl.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAccording to the official document of [tokenomics](https://docs.x2y2.io/tokens/tokenomics), the total supply is 1B. 90M tokens, initially for the airdrop purpose, were burned, and thus the current supply is around 910M. The team and treasury are allocated 100M tokens (10%), respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3vZ__YwuaFuKwTIU1K3QM.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe team’s portion is locked, and the token will linearly unlock 1/4 (2.5% of total supply) in another 180 days after 180 days. It also shares a cut from the market fee from day one but does not share the staking rewards.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z0lKFjZPBRGcK6isip7Lw.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe graph below shows how the fees are distributed (You can monitor them [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2?a=0xf704353b5c98577d3b4274614e62fc79676d33bd)). The total fee was 87e yesterday. The team, the treasury, ILO participants, and the staking holders were allocated 17e, 14.73e, 3.3e, and 51.55e, respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pxOChJhJSjIikq0c6qruU.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 2. X2Y2’s tokenomics is similar to LOOKS’s. Why is Dayu more optimistic about the one weaker in performance? Is that true that 10% tokens allocation is on the team? (Important: This is the crucial question to differentiate Value investing from the Ponzi scheme)\n\nLanxing:\n\nX2Y2 genuinely distributes the trading fees to token holders, with no pre-staking, market making, or competing with stakeholders. The team reacts quickly to the market and has published bulk purchases, bulk listing, and community-driven marketing. The founder (TP) keeps collecting advice from the community in the DC group and replies in person.\n\nAs for LOOKS, you can refer to [this article](https://bitcoinist.com/looksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens/). LOOKS’s team transacted 50% of its staking reward to cryptocurrency tumblers by controlling the market; this is an act of sacrificing LOOKS’s retail investors and destroying community trust, not to mention there was a pre-staking mechanism for private offers (a big halve of benefit to latecomers!).\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1490747114204368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1490747114204368898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flooksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens%2F](https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1490747114204368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1490747114204368898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flooksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens%2F)\n\nThe 30-day price chart of X2Y2 and LOOKS are shown below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQUpAgGnFmEaB82VXCfMA.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gesNw0SCw75ARNET3bw8.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nBAYC community is active in LOOKS’s private offers, and among them, many are KOLs which puts LOOKS in an advantageous position. **But it is worth noticing that the Otherdeed collection is traded in volumes of 34k e and 44k e in LOOKS and X2Y2, respectively.**\n\nThe trading volume of new projects on X2Y2 has already surpassed that of LOOKS’s, while the active daily user on X2Y2 is three times of LOOKS’s.\n\nThe performance of X2Y2 on price also outperforms in a downtrend bear market. The two competitors will collide in price within two months to think optimistically.\n\n## 3. What is X2Y2’s emission schedule? How about the selling pressure in the future? What is the MC now? How its data look like compared with other projects?\n\nLanxing:\n\nWe can see the emission schedule below or have more details [here](https://mirror.xyz/x2y2.eth).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BZ6s6U2WNbUNUL72jR10-.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAs mentioned above, the total supply now is less than 910M X2Y2. Tokens owned by the team and treasury (200M) are not in the circulating supply but are collecting the fees. The unlocking schedule of the team and treasury’s token is shown below. X2Y2 was launched on 2 Feb, the 1st treasury unlocked was in May, and the 1st unlock of the team’s token will be in August.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wb8osp7QQOwtvWHgWcOFG.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWe then talk about [X2Y2 Tokenomics 2.0](https://mirror.xyz/x2y2.eth/k2Bv3UMpNFJTJiYdf5m48sANHn-Ei3m6ohmkO29qeoU).\n\n624,902 X2Y2 tokens are distributed to both seller and buyer daily. 604,902 tokens are for selling incentive, while 20,000 is for purchase incentive.\n\nThere was a mistake in setting the initial parameters of the staking rewards contract. The error resulted in per stage having, instead of the intended per block halving, ended up distributing 56% of the total 200M rewards in the first 30 days instead of the 18% initially intended.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Y6Q1YfX6lZaJlIAqeaa7.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n4500M X2Y2 tokens are allocated for trading rewards, releasing 624,902 tokens every day from 15 Feb.\n\n15M ILO tokens are linearly unlocked and can be neglected.\n\n597,790.8 tokens are allocated for the staking pool. 91.7% of tokens now (\\~2327M tokens) are in the pool.\n\nCurrently, the selling pressure is mainly from the trading rewards. Despite 70% of the trading volume being from wash trading (for the token rebate), the actual volume is still more than 10% of Opensea’s.\n\n**Therefore, the foreseeable future selling pressure shall be due to the deductions of trading rewards and staking rewards. The staking holders are more likely to observe the growth rate of users and daily trading fees income to decide what is next.**\n\nSee below for X2Y2’s circulating supply:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NNRepp6FSd3gpji-OtPax.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 4. Are the late comers of X2Y2 the money-printer of the early birds? If not, how much emission is from staking? Is the trading volume high enough to support the profit model? What will the emission schedule look like in the future?\n\nLanxing：\n\nX2Y2 is not a Ponzi scheme since there are actual trading fees as profit to support. Token holders who are staking are rewarded X2Y2 and share WETH from trading fees. The business model is akin to a royalty business but shares dividends every day instead of quarterly.\n\n**The current staking APY is 93.1%, trading fee APY is 61.2%.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jp2pySGwn16L90acx7l8N.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nFor inquiry on trading volume, please refer to question 1.\n\nFor the token emission schedule, please refer to question 3.\n\n## 5. How about the team and dev? Do they have a broad vision? Do they have executive power? Have the product developed on schedule? How is the user experience?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. TP, the founder, has a background in IT with sincere characteristics and listens to the community. You are free to come to our DC and will see TP actively responds here and is highly open-minded to constructive suggestions.\n2. The slogan of X2Y2 is “By the people, for the people.” Although the team made a mistake in setting the initial parameters of the staking rewards contract, the team found no excuse for the problem nor escaped from the questioning but organized AMA to answer the community’s worry instead. The team members slept for only 3 hours per day in the first month X2Y2 was born. We can see now that X2Y2 has formed partnerships with multiple NFT tools, including GEM, GENIE, TRAIT SNIPER, RARITY SNIPER, etc., Not to mention BENDDAO in the coming future. Besides, there are connections with other NFT communities. For instance, a strategic partnership was made with the NFT Alpha community, and Trait Sniper's CEO came to our AMA in person.\n3. The energy of the team is also high. X2Y2 is the first in the DAO NFT sector developing functions of bulk purchase, collection offers, and bulk listing. You can check the status of X2Y2’s development by clicking the link below.\n\n[https://www.notion.so/e503954ad1c44e018f956a04a0770713](https://www.notion.so/e503954ad1c44e018f956a04a0770713)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zn-XMrgaQlmjCa75laGmh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nMany users appreciate X2Y2 for its extra-low fee on trading and smooth user experience.\n\n@0x0nassis, who has more than 105k followers on Twitter, publicly admires X2Y2.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e4R5bzksXFPKpjJP_l70o.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nRecently free mint is the trend, and people can save a ton of trading fees simply by using the user-friendly X2Y2 exchange, as said in the real user experience below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Bj8ix0kWPFwtbvk0y2Xs.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nResearch institutions, including Delphi, have already mentioned X2Y2 twice.\n\n[https://twitter.com/x2y2cn/status/1532225099901767680/photo/1](https://twitter.com/x2y2cn/status/1532225099901767680/photo/1)\n\n**Active daily user pumping from 100 in Feb to a stable number of over 6000 now** is the best evidence showing how user-friendly X2Y2 is from the users’ perspective. At least, we can be so proud of saying our server does not go down often like Opensea.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TAHYwcTjEZRGngxurJFqM.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 6. Will exchange be a vital part of the NFT market?\n\nOf course. The need for exchanging is one kind of inelastic demand.\n\n## 7.  Where is the fund supporting the team’s development without being able to use the allocated tokens? Is there any plan for partnerships with VCs? Wen BN?\n\nLanxing：\n\nInitially, the development fund came from the team’s pocket, and part of it now comes from the share of the trading fee. It is worth mentioning that X2Y2 spends almost nothing on marketing since the community takes the initiative to handle this part.\n\nPartnership with VCs is on our list, and we will announce details at the right moment. **We think the resources a VC could bring are more critical to the financial support.**\n\nX2Y2 is already listed on MEXC, and **some big exchanges are also approaching us.**\n\n## 8. What is the technical background of the team? Is there any product made before as a track record? Are the media supporting us?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. Most of them are from the IT industry and haven’t disclosed any product developed before yet. I can tell that they are all experts on blockchain tech with successful experience in exchanges.\n2. Foresight News (founded by a former ChainNews member), Wincrypto, and ChainCatcher are all publishing news about X2Y2.\n\n## 9. How comes the price drop from 4.5U to 0.2U?\n\nLanxing：\n\nPrice follows the supply-and-demand theory.\n\nThe initial price was 0.5U and pumped to 4.5U for only two days. The team did not manipulate the market. The market was so hype because, on the one hand, investors were affected by emotion (since many Chinese KOL twitted about it), and some were trying to make a profit by using this hype (by pushing the price to a great altitude and dumping it at a high price). Also, the extra-high staking APY attracted people to be part of us.\n\nHowever, that is not the whole story.\n\nFirst, the result of changing people’s behavior with tokenomics 1.0 did not meet our original expectations. Still, it attracted those who wanted to make profits with the mechanism instead (I am totally fine with this behavior since this is part of the market). 200M tokens were prepared for listing rewards and were proportional related to the listing period; thus, most of the listings were low liquidity/ hard to sell, so they could generate more listing rewards. This was not what we wanted! No trading, no profit. The team then modified the listing reward mechanism several times during that period and kept developing new functions.\n\nThe mistake of the emission schedule also contributes to the drop. Initially, there should be 1.23M tokens released daily, but they ended up being 3.7M tokens instead (Question 2). The APY was super high in the first month (10,000%) and became colossal selling pressure later.\n\nThirdly, newbies, who did not understand Defi but were optimistic about the NFT market, might buy the tokens in FOMO and be scared off by the drop.\n\nThe trading volume of the X2Y2 token was more than 10M daily during that period. Most of the selling was from staking and listing rewards, and the buying force was insufficient. More importantly, our NFT trading volume did not benefit from the incentives, and thus investors were reluctant to get into X2Y2 anymore.\n\n**However, it is worth mentioning that if someone buys 100k tokens at 1U and stakes, the number of tokens now becomes around 350k. Plus the share of trading fees, the investment is already in profit in ETH-standard and can exchange for more ETH than he paid.**\n\nDuring the sudden drop, the community was overwhelmed with pessimistic emotion, especially ILO participants. There were also complaints from KOL. The team was lacking sleep too. After that, TP initiated several AMA and promised to change the situation with execution. The team believed that the only way out was to attract the actual NFT traders, so the platform can start making profits to stabilize the price. Therefore, we waved the trading fee (0%) in April, compensated the gas fee with daily 620k X2Y2 tokens, canceled the listing rewards, burned the 92M unclaimed tokens, and publicized the status of development (question 5). We found this was working and continued promotion in May, charging only a 0.5% fee on trading. The Otherdeed was hot in the month, and its trading volume on X2Y2 excesses more than 10k e. This is how X2Y2 has become the second biggest NFT exchange.\n\nWe organized an X2Y2 volunteering group in early March starting with only several people. And now, we can see from the Twitter, Wechat group, DC, etc., are promoting X2Y2. X2Y2 now has over 6k daily active users and 72e average daily trading fee income. The income is based on a 0.5% trading fee rate still, which will be 360e daily if the rate is the same as Opensea (2.5%).\n\n## 10. A token’s value capture is essential. Is there any benefit to holding X2Y2 tokens? What is the forecast in optimistic and pessimistic cases?\n\nLanxing：\n\n1. Holding X2Y2 tokens means you have the right to share trading fees and staking rewards.\n2. To evaluate X2Y2 needs to take many aspects into account. The fact now is that there are only 2M ERC addresses that are active NFT traders, and 1,500 among them are whales. The market capitalization of NFT is just 26B. Compared to the total 54.38M ETH holders, the room for growth in the NFT market is enormous.\n3. If we want to know if the growth rate of trading volume and the daily active user is fast enough and if X2Y2 has moats and effective promotion strategies, we need to count on competitors.\n\nThe valuation of Opensea now is $13B. Since X2Y2’s daily user and net trading volume has already exceeded 10% of Opensea, giving X2Y2 a valuation of $1.3B seems fair.\n\nPessimistically or in the short term, I may start to buy and stake the tokens when it drops to $0.15U.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kF4WegCb5YKHfIevbZ94x.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 11. If the profit model of LOOKS trying to reward wash trading is a kind of Ponzi scheme, why are X2Y2’s staking and trading rewards different from that? How is the model different from projects like FCOIN? Will the latecomers be the money printer for the early birds?\n\nLanxing：\n\nThis question is answered in Question 2. To understand the differences, you also need to clarify what a Ponzi scheme is. Having income from outer layer sources like X2Y2’s profit model is not a Ponzi scheme.\n\n**Questions raised by Lanxing：**\n\n## 12. Why is the community willing to promote X2Y2 volunteering?\n\nPlease check the article below (Only the Chinese version is available now):\n<https://mirror.xyz/0x4631e0eCda7a39ba951f297c65C1A6E680dc94c4/k_avW8kYhE4QklvDvuAs8becTFbCHzTR274e7bmLX0A>\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-GPIq6KjBJaENl1HHI3mU.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## 13.

You can open a long position if you believe one asset’s price will go up or open short positions if you expect it will go down. At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17around 20 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J8zu2hqPwpMn4gBJxvyZO.png?height=790&width=1370)\n\nYou can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-curie-arbitrageur\n\nThe way **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)** works is that, whenever there is a price difference between [Perp v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) (a derivative DEX) and [FTX](https://ftx.com/) (a CEX), the bot will buy on the cheaper side and sell on the more expensive side. Out of the box, this template allows you to set the desired price difference for the bot to take action. Additionally, you can specify the markets for the bot to run the arbitrage strategy.\n\nOf course, we can’t just look at the rewards. How about the risks associated with running this bot?\n\nThe main risk is liquidation, which can happen when you use too much leverage to trade on either Perp v2 or FTX. Luckily, the bot lets you set the margin ratio you’re comfortable with, which is the reciprocal of leverage, and it will start to reduce the position sizes whenever the margin ratio is reached.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n***If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot by the readme in the [perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.***\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned what Perp v2 is and the risks and rewards of running an arbitraging bot on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a bot on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35K8a0HNOpAgrqyZe8-9u.png?height=1056&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer.\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmWcwfTH5meqjcgJXX42B.png?height=772&width=1368)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FG5l25__gsXRy2WqTwan9.png?height=976&width=1026)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-curie-arbitrageur repo and build it locally. You can do so with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur.git`\n\n`cd perp-curie-arbitrageur`\n\n`npm install`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything goes well, you should be able to see responses like the ones below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oHajKZfB6oCOvhrfk_ln.png?height=420&width=1366)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances, especially those who claim to be part of a customer service team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AZkHnVO2PIpDf7g12I2Ix.png?height=808&width=1366)\n\n## Get the Tokens you Need\n\nThere are two tokens we need in order to run perp-curie-arbitrageur. They are ETH and USDC. **Please be aware that, since there is no test account on FTX, we’ll be using real ETH and USDC in the following**. It’s better to start with a small amount to get comfortable with it and then increase from there.\n\n* **For ETH**:\n\n  If you only use CEX like Binance or FTX, you can use [LayerSwap](https://www.layerswap.io/) to transfer some of your ETH to Optimism. If you have ETH on chains like Ethereum or BNB Chain, you can use [TransferTo.xyz](https://transferto.xyz/swap) to bridge your ETH to Optimism. **ETH is used to pay the gas fees for your transactions** and each transaction on Perp v2 costs around 0.001 ETH, so even 0.1 ETH can be used for a long time.\n* **For USDC**:\n\n  Similar to ETH, you can use either LayerSwap or TransferTo depending on how much you want to transfer and from where. And as mentioned above, **USDC is used as the collateral for your positions**.\n\nAlso, because by default, MetaMask doesn’t include Optimism in the network list, you need to go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to add Optimism to your MetaMask to see your ETH and USDC balance in your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni590TmTaReallO5-aRV6.png?height=764&width=1366)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Rename the .env.example file to .env and modify it\n\nYou need to rename the .env.example file in the root folder of perp-curie-arbitrageur to .env and add a web3 endpoint, your wallet’s private key, and everything related to FTX to it. Here is what your .env file looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TBM7eUvmNl8RN63gTvlWy.png?height=386&width=1366)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint for Optimism, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)**. If you wonder what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider, e.g. Infura, will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/74kJqYT6TE7k7ntWyKUE8.png?height=796&width=1366)\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.”  Similar to recovery phrases, you should **never** share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uI8QlZXgLQLdkFhHl6ucq.png?height=950&width=560)\n\nAs for FTX’s API key and secret, you can generate them by going to the [API page](https://ftx.com/settings/api) of your subaccount and clicking \"Create API Key”. The permission should be “Trading” only.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XQOmbcYNb_-sCsYEVNr-c.png?height=454&width=820)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* BALANCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check your balance on FTX and your address.\n* ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH:\n* BALANCE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH: The maximum amount of gas fees in ETH that you’re willing to pay to do arbitrage. One thing worth pointing out is that , Optimism uses the first-comes, first-served approach to process transactions, meaning that increasing the ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH will not confirm any faster.\n* PERP_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO: As we mentioned above, the margin ratio is the metric to show how many leverages you use. The lower this metric, the easier for your position to get liquidated.  If you set them as 0.2, then the max leverage is 5x. Recommended to start from 1 to be safe.\n* PERP_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO: The margin ratio threshold when the positions on both platforms will start to be reduced. For instance, if you set them as 0.1 here, that means your positions will begin to be closed when your leverage reaches 10x. Recommended to begin with a number that is closer to 1 to start with.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_AMOUNT: 9000,\n  The USD value of the position that the bot should start to close when the emergency margin ratio is reached.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_SLEEP_SEC: The interval between each emergency reduction should be.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency that emergency checks should be conducted.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to true to enable this market.\n* FTX_MARKET_NAME: The name of the market on FTX. Usually, if it’s a perpetual market, then it’ll follow a naming convention of ticker-perp. For instance, BTC’s perpetual market is known as BTC-PERP on FTX.\n* ORDER_AMOUNT: Order amount in USDC for each trade. Remember to top up your account before running the bot.\n* SHORT_TRIGGER_SPREAD:\n* LONG_TRIGGER_SPREAD: The price difference threshold between both platforms at which the bot should start executing your strategy.\n* IS_EMERGENCY_REDUCE_MODE_ENABLED:\n  Whether (or not) the bot should reduce positions when the leverage is too high.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. However, the bot can support up to 5 markets simultaneously. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally\n\nThere is one extra step for Windows users - you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file otherwise it can’t read the parameters in your .env file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully on your machine, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5Go3tdgnLsHOHaraBjw0.png?height=564&width=1022)\n\n## Run on AWS Lambda\n\n*If you’re not familiar with AWS Lambda, you can watch this video to [learn more about it (or serverless in general) in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_VV2Fx32_Y&ab_channel=Fireship). But in general, the main selling point of AWS’ Lambda is that, instead of renting a dedicated server on AWS to run your program 24/7. You only pay the times when your application runs on a shared server, which is more suitable for our use case as the bot only runs from time to time based on your settings.*\n\nAs a starter for this section, **you need to register an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and install AWS CLI on your machine**. Check the installation instructions for each OS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).\n\n**Once AWS CLI is installed, you need to [configure your AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) by running the following command** in your Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows):\n\n`aws configure`\n\nThen you need to type your access key and secret. You can create them from the [Identity and Access Management page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oY3trcl2-nanWI5PxCV5L.png?height=258&width=1178)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YStXJ4AHlHEkI_b9QQTuw.png?height=686&width=1218)\n\nDepending on your settings, sometimes you need to create a new user on AWS to generate a key. To do so, you need to click Users on the Identity and Access Management page and then create a new user with permission to manage Lambda.\n\n**Following this, you need to type the AWS region you use in the .env file in your perp-curie-arbitrageur folder**. For instance, add AWS_REGION=ap-southest-1 to the file if you choose a server located in Singapore.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i13sUcuIHcQhUTzwfacHo.png?height=686&width=1228)\n\nAlso, for Windows users who have run the bot locally in the previous sections, you need to remove the two lines that you added in the index.ts file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nBy now we’re all set! Enter the following commands in your terminal to deploy the bot to AWS:\n\n`npm run build`\n\n`npm run sls:deploy`\n\nYou should be able to see the following responses if everything goes well:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HgxYHicK9JFy_6nU9HplL.png?height=490&width=1228)\n\nOnce your bot is running, you can see the real-time logs by going to the *perp-arbitrageur-production-main* Lambda function on AWS and clicking the “View logs in CloudWatch” under the Monitor tab. You should be able to see similar logs when running the bot on your computer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KmdiO6etAAGga9RGrOsYr.png?height=716&width=1228)\n\nCongratulations! Your bot is now automatically arbitraging the price difference between Perp v2 and FTX!\n\n## Further Modification Suggestions\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article, this bot is just a template for arbitraging between Perp v2 and FTX. Given the nature of an open-sourced software, anyone can add functionalities to this bot. Below are some directions that you can explore:\n\n* **Support more DEXes and CEXes**\n\n  You can modify the bot to support for CEXs like Binance or Huobi to discover more arbitraging opportunities. It also applies to derivative DEXs as there are numerous of them on the market.\n* **Better position wind down process**\n\n  Currently, the bot will close positions from both exchanges when the margin ratio reaches the limit you set. A better approach to wind down positions should be closing both sides when the prices on both exchanges are the same and do it gradually to reduce price impact aka slippage per trade.\n* **Error or success report**\n\n  Right now the bot only does its job quietly and you can only check CloudWatch to know its status. One way to improve this is to add a script to send out a Telegram or Discord message when certain criteria are met. For instance, you can write a script to send out Telegram messages when a trade is successful.\n\nThat’s the end of our tutorial on how to run **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)**!\n\n**Besides this tutorial, recently we also have released tutorials on how to run [perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker)!** Feel free to check them out.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/LWB40sjbmk4R34eq2ZD88vm466wAZ7iiskalKWGVPXc](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/LWB40sjbmk4R34eq2ZD88vm466wAZ7iiskalKWGVPXc)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/Om0vxOZKa3LTp22_fVhzMxrVPZ2blticcdmPzIrjkj4](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/Om0vxOZKa3LTp22_fVhzMxrVPZ2blticcdmPzIrjkj4)\n\n**One last thing - we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) on our Discord for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.

{"id": "7IVAN1t97XIWZWRFs0bm-JMB6WzKDrc6-5lopoMAEC4", "title": "Running Perp-maker for Profits & Fun: Part 1", "body": "[Perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker) is an open-source market-making template for [Perpetual Protocol v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post), the most popular dApp on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/apps/defi) *(a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum)*. Anyone can use or modify the template to facilitate trades on the protocol and earn fees.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll go over what Perpetual Protocol is, the risks and rewards associated with running the bot, and how to run it locally. Due to the length of this article, we’ll cover how to run the bot on AWS and further modification suggestions in part 2. Stay tuned!\n\n## Perpetual Protocol 101\n\nFirst thing first, what is Perpetual Protocol?\n\nPerpetual Protocol is a decentralized derivative exchange (DEX) where traders can use USDC *(a USD-pegged stablecoin)* to speculate on cryptocurrency’s price movement with up to 10x leverage. At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more! You can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6KeGLlSsa-3SOSv_-S-k1.png?height=806&width=1370)\n\n### But What does “Market-making” Mean?\n\nWhenever a trade happens, there will always be two sides involved - a taker and a maker. The takers initiate a trade, and the makers provide the inventory to let the taker take.\n\nHere is a real-life example. When buying a fish from a vendor, you’re the taker of this trade as you’re the one that takes what the vendor supplies. As for the vendor, he is the maker of this trade as he prepares the inventory (fish in this example) that makes this trade possible.\n\nSimilarly, being a market-maker, or “maker,” on Perp v2 means you [provide the liquidity](https://blog.perp.fi/how-to-provide-liquidity-on-perp-v2-9064ed085d7f) (the assets) that traders can take, making the market viable. In return, you receive 80% of the transaction fees paid by the trader. For instance, if a trader opens a long position and this trade happens in the price range you set, you act as the other side of the trade - i.e., opening a short position as a result, and vice versa.\n\nMakers on Perp v2 can choose the price range to which they provide liquidity. For instance, in the screenshot below, this user wants to provide liquidity to the BTC market with a price range of $9,991.99 to $60,081.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb5f4JjKvWmd88x2iwT2L.png?height=806&width=1370)\n\nWhenever a trade happens in that range, this user collects 80% of the transaction fees proportionately. One thing worth pointing out is that USDC is the only asset you need to deposit to start market-making on Perp v2. Once you deposit some USDC, the system will mint the virtual tokens (0.1 vBTC and 4316.31 vUSD in the screenshot) you need to trade or market-make with.\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-maker\n\nWith perp-maker, anyone can automate their market-making strategy on Perp v2 to earn transaction fees and liquidity mining rewards *(more on this later)*.\n\n**Out of the box, perp-maker lets you choose which market you want to provide liquidity to and within what price range**. As a reminder, if the market price moves out of the price range you set, you will not collect any transaction fees until it moves back in the range. **Perp-maker can automatically adjust your liquidity and realize the [impermanent loss](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3) when the market price reaches the price level you set.**\n\n### But What is Impermanent Loss?\n\nOn Perp v2, makers act as the other side of each trade. If a trader makes a profit, a maker loses money. This loss is impermanent as it will become 0 when the market price returns to the initial price. Even if the market price moves away from the initial price, you can collect fees if the market price stays in the price range.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4T-vCemGHAoAu6SYZnmjR.png?height=1012&width=1908)\n\nAs a rule of thumb, **the wider the price range you set, the less [impermanent loss](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3) you suffer; however, the less transaction fees you can collect. And the more transaction fees generated on a market, the better for you as a maker.** You can use the [Perpetual Simulator](https://defi-lab-test-vhee9.ondigitalocean.app/perpetualsimulator) to simulate different price ranges in any given market to gauge the profitability of your strategy.\n\nAdditionally, **the developers behind the protocol provide its token, known as $PERP, as an extra reward to encourage more people to be makers**. This reward is distributed weekly proportional to the transaction fees you collect for that market. **This weekly reward is known as liquidity mining rewards.**\n\nTo recap - **if the transaction fees plus liquidity mining rewards outweigh the impermanent loss, it’s a profitable strategy**. If not, it can still be a profitable strategy over a more extended timeframe as it takes time for the combined value of the fees and liquidity mining rewards to catch up with the impermanent loss.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n*If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot using the readme in the [perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.*\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned how Perp v2 works and the risks and rewards of being a maker on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a perp-maker on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6QOtvjcuMi36QkSCyQLfm.png?height=1062&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer:\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N4a5KHu_9C987ll57Uyxt.png?height=782&width=1370)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node’ is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZqQ1j9QNzMjFhO46GrGPM.png?height=980&width=1024)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-maker repo and build it locally. You can do it with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker.git`\n\n`cd perp-maker`\n\n`npm i`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything works properly, you should see something on your terminal that’s similar to what’s displayed below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dIWmLkTfy6EDqLNK3H5On.png?height=496&width=1372)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mBbPh3b35FiRWt5KwFPlY.png?height=808&width=1370)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Modify .env file\n\nYou need to add a web3 endpoint and your wallet’s private key to the .env file in your perp-maker folder. Here is what it looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4-JyvjGUDUWHpm33uiKpm.png?height=872&width=1370)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).** For testing purposes, you should get an endpoint for “Optimism Kovan”, not “Optimism Mainnet” or “Kovan”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m4tW5ytUsE7qwyP66q3bt.png?height=802&width=1370)\n\n*If you’re wondering what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider e.g. Infura will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.*\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.” Similar to recovery phrases, you should never share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sXTYNdQbm1Irp0oiHOB7l.png?height=1032&width=608)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* ADJUST_MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI: The maximum gas fee in Gwei which the bot will adjust liquidity. If the gas price exceeds this number, the liquidity won't be adjusted. Currently, the gas price on Optimism is fixed at 0.001 Gwei.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to \\`true\\` to enable this market.\n* LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT:How much vUSD (after leverage) to provide as liquidity. Perp v2 supports up to 10x leverage, meaning that you can use up to 10x of your deposited USDC to provide liquidity.\n* LIQUIDITY_RANGE_OFFSET: The offset to upper price and lower price of the liquidity range. For example, if it’s set to 0.05, it will provide liquidity from (current price / 1.05) to (current price \\* 1.05).\n* LIQUIDITY_ADJUST_THRESHOLD: The threshold that the bot will remove your existing liquidity, realize the impermanent loss, and place a new price range. For example, if it’s set to 0.01, the bot will remove your existing liquidity when the current price goes out of the range below (initial price/ 1.01) or above (the initial price\\* 1.01), and subsequently provides liquidity with a new price range based on LIQUIDITY_RANGE_OFFSET and the current price.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally on Optimism Kovan (testnet)\n\nYou need to get some test tokens before running the bot on Optimism testnet. Head to [Optifaucet](https://kovan.optifaucet.com/), type in your wallet address *(which starts with 0x)* and send out the request.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/472eL25IaWpOqyc8sth44.png?height=718&width=1230)\n\n*If you run out of the test ETH to pay for transactions, you can go to [Paradigm’s faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to request more test ETH and then bridge them to Optimism Kovan via [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).*\n\nWe’re almost ready! The bot by default is set to run on Optimism. To run on Optimism Kovan, you need to add an endpoint for the testnet (as demonstrated above) and comment *(add two “slashes” before the codes)* the two lines below in the index.ts file which is located in the src folder.\n\n`// process.env[\"STAGE\"] = \"production\"`\n\n`// process.env[\"NETWORK\"] = \"optimism\"`\n\nFor Windows users, you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file:\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv):\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal to do it:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gcsUq-i2kMpXkbpk-f3d.png?height=372&width=1374)\n\nAnother way to validate if the template runs successfully is to check the target markets in the pool section on the UI. For testnet *(Optimism Kovan)*, please visit [testnet.perp.exchange](https://testnet.perp.exchange/); As for mainnet *(Optimism)*, visit [app.perp.com](https://app.perp.com/).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wTbtDlx5qj7XnJaxGMRs1.png?height=764&width=1374)\n\nAlright!

{"id": "C_ekRTF4b7Hm1QsdlFZLV2BPlZAQuqMm7bpOZPt1eEw", "title": "StepN随想", "body": "       2021年底的时候朋友介绍了Sweatcoin给我，那是使我重新开始看Web 3 运动类项目的契机。在此之后的两个月，一位朋友在偶然的交谈中和我说他买了StepN，说起来有趣，那时我的第一反应是这是一个新的运动品牌，后来经他提醒才知道这是一个区块链的运动项目。早期基本就是对着英文白皮书边跑步边研究，后来发了朋友圈后又被朋友拉进了StepN的社区，那一刻开始认知其初期用户画像和社区文化。\n\n       到今天，StepN已经占据讨论的话题榜许久了。无论是曾经GMT 从0.1U到4U的财富效应，还是屡禁不止的关于其庞氏倒塌的谈论和预测，这个项目都是2022年迄今为止最备受瞩目和资本青睐的项目。 那今天，我作为一个“资深”用户，来理性、客观地分析一下，StepN究竟是怎样一个项目。 （利益相关披露：持有sneakers 9双；感性披露：忠实用户）\n\n**项目背景和赛道分析：**    \n\n      首先，StepN属于Web 3 的应用类项目。在Axie带领疯狂的Gamfi season开始之后，就有无数关于Web 3 应用的讨论（在这里仅讨论针对C端用户的项目）。 这里我们先回顾一下Web3 是什么。 <https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/>\n\n**Web 3 的特征包括：**\nAnyone who is on the network has permission to use the service – or in other words, permission isn't required.\nNo one can block you or deny you access to the service.\nPayments are built in via the native token.\n\n       这是 Sam Richards 给出的关于什么是Web 3 的定义。但是发展到今天的Web 3 上的应用与Web 3的概念并非全然相同。\n\n       首先，应用是搭建在去中心化的网络之上（比如Ethereum，Solana，Avax等）。其次，所有的支付手段都有原生代币支付。最后大多数应用也有相当中心化的团队和管理方式，比如监督管理的部分、规则制定、分成方式的制定、甚至是用户数据是中心化存储还是去中心化存储。（姑且称这些应用为Web 2.5）\n\n        这里先问一个问题：**作为一个普通人，驱使你从Web 2 的app迁徙到web3 的动力是什么？再进一步，如果Web 2 的app内在革新拥抱 web 3，那还需要这些Web 3 的dapp不？** \n\n这俩问题非常开放，我主要分享我个人对第一个问题的回答：**数据隐私和奖励**，会是最大的驱使我使用web 3应用的原因。 \n\n         **数据隐私**非常好理解，比如今天我们在微信上聊天所有的记录都可以被微信监测并管理，我们在ins上浏览的数据也会被采集然后通过算法推荐最适合你的商品给你。那随着数据权的进一步发展和个人信息保护意识的崛起，会有一批人为了保护自己的数据权利，迁徙到web 3上。 \n\n        **奖励**也很直白，我们在Web 2花时间花钱但是什么也得不到的事情，如果在Web3可以获得奖励，无论是FT还是NFT，都会吸引一大批使用者到来。\n\n       就这两点而言，现在我们可以看到的大多数项目，都是做好了第二点。 StepN尤其是如此。 STEPN缘何如此成功 Web 2 运动相关的app非常多，比如Keep、FitTime等。Web 3 和Move 2 earn相关的Dapp有包括像Stepapp、Genopets、Walken、Sweatcoin、Aglet等。 <https://twitter.com/SnapFingersDAO/status/1528028764172537862?s=20&t=6TU3wodbEXw1pcmqZYSMqQ>\n\n\n那这么多的应用中，为何StepN脱颖而出？接下来我们来分析一下这个项目在设计上成功的几大原因\n“**简单好用的产品、强大真实的社群、和防作弊措施**” （我的概括，欢迎讨论）\n\n**产品**：\n\n       StepN的产品非常简单和专注。其所有的使用场景都是围绕着Sneaker来的。如果要玩这个游戏，在完成注册账户和钱包之后，首先你需要买至少一双鞋。有了这双鞋才能开始所有的游戏体验。 \n\n       游戏里有三个核心要素：鞋子、能量、宝石 鞋子是你用来赚钱的工具，不过要注意，哪怕同时拥有很多很多双鞋，你也只能使用其中一双鞋子来走路赚钱。 能量：你拥有的鞋子的数量和稀有度会决定你所拥有的能量 宝石：鞋子拥有4个不同的属性，拥有宝石可以升级\n\n**真实强大的社群**：   \n\n       首先明确，这一点更适用于Solana上的StepN。事实上，StepN在发展之初，其实几乎没有和媒体合作过。他们专注于社区运营和合作，经常开放AMA，答题送sneaker，以及和其他社区一起运营活动。\n\n       就我观察，其在韩国和日本、台北的很多社群都是粉丝用户自发发起的，包括了线上的社群和线下的运营。 这一点非常重要，因为gamfi项目事实上只有不断的新增用户，才能维持住游戏系统的稳定，才能维持住币价和鞋子的价格。 \n\n        这里说的用户是排除了工作室的。因为有工作室入场的gamfi，虽会昙花一现的暴涨，但生命周期也会迅速变短。BSC所经历的也正映射着这一切。 \n\n**防作弊措施**： \n\n        这也是游戏的基石，也是把这个StepN变成长期生活方式的前提。AI识别准确度不断提高。看项目方最近的几次更新也都非常强调他的反作弊系统。虽然也出了误被识别为Bot的“惨剧”，但是这丝毫没有影响反作弊在项目方心中的重要性。\n\n       这其实让我想起了当年高考的各种防作弊举措。这虽然不会对个体的分数产生什么影响，但是这是保证“高考是选拔人才的制度”的大前提。\n\n**STEPN下一步何去何从**    \n\n      最近我们看到StepN上出现了各种各样的问题，FUD的声音和社区的失望也是此起彼伏。那StepN接下来应该何去何从？ 首先，无论是从项目方的角度还是从投资机构的角度，StepN第一步已经取得了重大的成功。现在出现了很多问题，**恰恰是因为其发展的速度超出了最初的设想，以及愈发庞大的用户数量，不断压缩试错的空间。**\n\n       在我看来，STEPN已经做好了第一步，即吸引用户，那接下来更多要解决的就是用户留存问题。 \n\n         在这里非常赞同破音(Twitter@poyincom)的想法。（以下观点引用于破音，稍作修改）\n\n *“现在玩家分两部分：一类比较关注回本和价格，但这么高的回报率不可能一直维持下去，收益降低他们马上会离开。一类是忠实玩家，我微信上看到比较多。有人说他做梦都想要一双绿鞋，还有用户说，只要715让他走就行。他们感受到了Stepn对生活的正反馈，这才是价值所在。他们对经济模型没有投机用户这么在意。*\n\n*要做的是保住忠实用户，教化更多其他的用户。前提肯定是产品正常使用，（很多玩家是因为宕机没耐心）然后才是补经济模型。*\n\n*用户留存是重中之重，更需要多种样的消费场景：冲动消费、情感消费、炫耀消费，健康消费。比如这次更新的在鞋上刻字就很好。没消费场景，经济模型压力肯定大。提高忠实用户，降低投机用户比例，才能达到生态平衡”*\n\n我的想法类似，除了分类用户，倾听社区声音、保持App正常运行外：\n**1 短期：创造更多的消耗场景的出现**——单纯的play2earn不具有长期可持续性，可以看最长寿的Axie的今天。需要在让用户赚取GST的同时能够把钱花在这里\n\n**2 长远：应该有更巨大的可能性**，依托于fitness & health有衍生的社交、消费都可能是StepN能够覆盖的领域\n\n关于这一点我能想到的一个理想状态：     \n\n       如果Gamfi世界的玩家就好像深圳的一个打工人，收入用来消费（吃喝住行）+ 投资（买房、买股），最后都留在了深圳（游戏系统内）。同时也要考虑玩家间的博弈，不是人人都能赚到钱（就像深圳也不是人人赚到钱一样），这样才能维持长久的平衡和存续。 这要求了项目方不断考虑增加各种utility来消耗、投资，把钱留下。社交属性、个性化属性也应该在这个节点出现。\n\n**游戏内的重要机制** \n\nshoe minting：   \n\n       这类似于是游戏中的繁殖。鞋子的总基数是这么扩大的，同时Mint也可以让鞋子持有者在一些情况下赚取收益。 这里就不得不提，这次更新后（20220608）的mint的成本调整。这次BSC的鞋子暴涨事件背后也暴露了这么设定的问题。如果mint的利润过高，会引得工作室入场疯狂繁殖，而扰乱正常的生态发展周期。 \n\n       更新后规则为：当GST币价逐渐升高时，除GST和基础GMT （baseGMT）外增加额外GMT（addGMT）消耗。Mint成本公式为：A GST + B baseGMT + (A+B)\\* x% addGMT。以下是 x 随GST币价升高的变化规则：\n\n```\n2.1 当GST<4U时，x=0\n2.2 当GST在4U和8U之间时，x=50% \n2.3 当GST在8U和12U之间时，x=100% \n2.4 当GST在12U和16U之间时，x=200% \n2.5 当GST在16U和20U之间时，x=400% \n2.6 当GST在20U和30U之间时，x=800%\n2.7 当GST在30U和40U之间时，x=1600%\n2.8 当GST在40U和50U之间时，x=3200%\n2.9 当GST>50U时，x=6400%\n```\n\n       我们对比一下调整前后的公式可以看到：新的动态mint成本主要旨在打击单纯mint交易获利的行为，引导用户回到运动走路的初心。\n\n**STEPN的代币模型**\nStepN采取了双代币模型。GMT为治理代币而GST为游戏内实用代币。与 GMT 代币不同，GST 享有无限供应，可以通过基本运动在游戏中铸造。\n\n这样的代币模型里，是有一些问题需要去思考。这不仅仅是StepN，也是整个Gamfi都要去思考的问题（虽然我觉得把StepN归类为Gamfi也不完全合适）\n**1、GST/游戏内代币的通胀模型和永恒增发\n2、GST价格和MINT的回本周期问题（BSC链之所以迅速发展又迅速崩塌的原因）\n3、GMT应用场景和赋能\n4、关于庞氏批评**\n\n1、GST/游戏内代币的通胀模型和永恒增发   \n\n       Stepn 同时也是其他gamfi 最大的问题 是 如何长久的产生GST（或者游戏内无限增发）造成的抛压？ 以及鞋子不断增长，如何达到一个供需平衡。现在我们可以看到由于新增的缓慢和不断生产出来的GST对市场造成了持续的抛压。同时，GST的持续下跌造成了回本周期的不断的不断拉长。\n\n      这一点我觉得其实和所有国家货币的发行一样，**其实我们的财富一直随着国家发行货币被稀释（1990年100USD的购买力 vs 今天）但是通胀的速度和消费的速度以及收入的速度如何达到平衡，非常考验项目方的智慧和设计。**\n\n2、GST价格和MINT的回本周期问题  \n\n      这一点昨天的更新已经提供了一种解答。延长cool down时间和mint cost的动态调整。 还记得不久前的BNB realm，b-gst和s-gst的价格出现巨大的鸿沟，最多的时候b-gst达到40，同期s-gst的价格只有5u。巨大的价差、mint 的巨大收益以及当时的能量共享机制也给了投机者机会。众多的工作室和投机者涌入Stepn的BSC链，在短期内推动价格急速上涨后，也迅速地走向消亡。\n\n3、GMT应用场景和赋能\n由于在现在这个发展阶段GMT并没有什么实质性的用处，因此GST现更像是这个游戏的基石。GST的产生只有一种方式，及时走路。但是其消耗却有包括 升级、mint、开宝箱、合成宝石、转账等等构成。\n这里期待项目方的解答。\n\n4、是否是庞氏？ 庞氏的批判其实不仅是对于Stepn，更是对于整个Gamfi生态。我们可以看到大多数的Gamfi项目中的Fi，就是与金融相结合。金融其实也包括很多形式、像是借贷、存款、保险等多种形式。但是现在的Gamfi只用了很少的部分，即play to earn。玩游戏的前期所投入的资金（用于购买NFT、道具或者代币）后期会因为在游戏中赚取NFT或者游戏代币而产生收益。   \n\n       **但是凭空生产出来的代币意义为何？ 发行依据是什么？使用价值是什么？ 所谓的外部性又是什么？** \n\n     我们可以看到，比特币诞生之初，也只有很低的价值。几万个比特币买pizza的故事我们也听过。 **代币的价值在于共识。而建立共识的方式，则很多种多样。**\n\n     在Stepn这个个案中，我觉得可以把GMT（治理代笔）看作是公司的股权的token化的形式。所有的代币持有者就像股东一样，可以以特定方式参与公司治理。我们也可以一起去思考，在这样的假定下，token持有者如何更好地去共享公司的增长。同时，也可以看到Stepn在拓展可能的外部性，从branding层面出品联名鞋子，是Stepn链接外部的尝试。

DID 规范**\n\n1）DID标识符，是一个全局唯一的表示你身份的东西，就像你的身份证号码一样。其形式大致如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MYOvCtTnkpf3G0zi_T7h3.png?height=121&width=522)\n\nDID示例：did:eth:123456789abcdefg\n\nDID标识符不容易记忆。根据Zooko三角形理论，没有任何标识符能够同时实现易记忆、安全、去中心化。在这里，W3C的DID取了后两者。\n\nDID Infrastructure是一个全局键值对数据库，这个数据库要么是某个DID兼容的区块链，要么是某个DID兼容的分布式账本，或者是某个DID兼容的去中心化网络（其实这个数据库的位置就是DID标识符中的example字段，目前已经有非常多的合法地址）。在这个数据库中，DID标识符是键，而DID文档是值。\n\n2）DID文档是一个JSON-LD Object，包括6个部分（都是optional的）：\n\n1、DID标识符。\n\n2、一个加密材料的集合。比如公钥。\n\n3、一个加密协议的集合。\n\n4、一个服务端点的集合。\n\n5、时间戳。\n\n6、一个可选的JSON-LD签名。用来证明这个DID文档是合法的。\n\n文档内容示例：\n\n{\n\n\"@context\": \"https://w3id.org/did/v1\",\n\n\"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n\"authentication\": \\[{\n\n// used to authenticate as did:...fghi\n\n\"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1\",\n\n\"type\": \"RsaVerificationKey2018\",\n\n\"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n\"publicKeyPem\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\\\\r\\\\n\"\n\n}\\],\n\n\"service\": \\[{\n\n// used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID\n\n\"id\":\"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs\",\n\n\"type\": \"VerifiableCredentialService\",\n\n\"serviceEndpoint\": \"https://example.com/vc/\"\n\n}\\]\n\n}\n\n这里需要注意的是，DID文档中没有任何和你个人真实信息相关的内容，比如你的真实姓名、地址、手机号等。因此光靠DID规范是无法验证一个人的身份的，必须要靠DID应用层中的VC。\n\n**2. 可验证声明**\n\nW3C认为前面的DID规范是基础，而把可验证声明视作是next higher layer，并认为这一层才是建立DID整个体系的价值所在。因为在这个应用层中，DID既可以用来标识个体的身份、也可以用来标识组织的身份，甚至标识物品的身份。\n\n可验证声明类似于数字签名，要实现数字签名，需要有PKI体系，可验证声明也是一样，需要用一套系统来支持它。在可验证声明系统中，有以下几种参与者：\n\n\\*\\*发行者：\\*\\*拥有用户数据并能开具可验证声明的实体，如政府、银行、大学等机构和组织。\n\n**验证者**：接受可验证声明并进行验证，由此可以提供给出示可验证声明者某种类型的服务。\n\n\\*\\*持有者：\\*\\*向发行者请求、收到、持有可验证声明的实体。向验证者出示可验证声明。开具的可验证声明可以放在可验证声明钱包里，方便以后再次使用。\n\n\\*\\*标识符注册机构：\\*\\*维护去中心化身份数据库，如某条区块链、分布式账本。\n\n**五、 基于区块链技术的去中心化身份平台**\n\n**1.uPort**\n\nuPort是基于以太坊的分布式数字身份管理服务，它可以允许用户进行身份验证、无密登录、数字签名并和以太坊上的其它应用交互。\n\nuPort的整体架构由智能合约、开发者库和移动APP组成。其中移动APP持有用户的密钥。以太坊智能合约构成身份管理的核心，包括用户的uPort标识符管理、身份凭证的管理、以及可让用户在丢失移动设备时恢复身份的逻辑。开发者库可让第三方应用开发者把uPort集成到他们的应用中。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nuPort的底层基础设施是公有链以太坊。uPort DID方法已注册到W3C维护的注册表。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\nuPort智能合约设计体现了用户对数字身份的管理控制和使用。用户使用uPort DID登录其他在以太坊上注册的应用。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NkkszDQfGuZz-fUo5mA2X.jpeg?height=264&width=775)\n\n**uPort基于标识符的交互方式**\n\n**（1）标识符**\n\n其中，代理合约是用户数字身份的象征，uPort身份的核心标识符是代理合约的地址；控制合约，是代理合约的正式拥有者。\n\n控制合约维护了核心访问控制特性，包含密钥恢复和访问控制逻辑；控制合约由uPort移动App中安全存储的密钥进行控制。\n\n这种设计允许用户使用密钥向代理合约自我认证，并代表代理合约行事，有利于用户在保持标识符不变的情况下替换私钥。\n\n**（2）交互**\n\n应用DAPP与uPort App均使用了以太坊智能合约，代理合约可以向应用合约转发交易，并且通过这种机制，uPort身份与以太坊区块链上的其他智能合约进行交互。\n\n**（3）可验证凭证应用层**\n\nuPort的身份认证应用中的用户角色包含凭证发放机构、用户、应用、uPort共四方。\n\nuPort和凭证发布机构合作，凭证发放机构在以太坊网络上注册自己的身份，能够签署和验证数据；凭证发放机构在其应用中提供二维码信息以便于用户交互，用户使用uPort APP扫描二维码，向凭证发放机构注册自己的uPort ID。凭证发放机构根据业务需求按自己的方式认证用户信息，认证通过后向用户发放带有签名的身份凭证。\n\nuPort服务通过注册合约管理uPort ID和用户的身份凭证信息，每一个uPort身份标识符绑定了一个相关的链下数据结构（如：IPFS），身份凭证存储在链下。注册合约扮演逻辑上中心化，物理上去中心的注册表或查找表，将每一个uPort身份标识符映射到一个IPFS摘要上，这个IPFS摘要与包含了用户属性、个人数据、见证的结构相链接。只有uPort身份的所有者（设备密钥的持有者）才有权利去修改相对应的注册入口。\n\n用户注册新的应用时，应用通过二维码与用户交互，获取uPort ID和应用需要的凭证。如果用户注册合约中已经存储了相应的凭证，应用从uPort服务器获取该凭证进行验证。验证通过后，应用将uPort ID注册为用户账户，以后用户只需要使用uPort ID即可登录该应用。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nuPort没有提出新的治理框架，遵循了以太坊的治理模式，即通过以太币支付网络交易费用。\n\n**2.ENS**\n\n以太坊名称服务（ENS）是一种基础工具，可将任何以太坊地址转换为公共配置文件。它的主要工作是将人类可读的名称映射成机器可读的状态。你可以使用amberfin.eth，而不是使用一长串依靠人脑无从记忆的地址来进行交易。并且由于ENS的分层性质，拥有该域的任何人也可能拥有子域。\n\n例如，因为Amber Group拥有“amberfin.eth”它也可以创建“pay.amberfin.eth”。\n\n**Amber Group的ENS记录**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_nAD0Oatm3XJVfHx56Pey.png?height=432&width=640)\n\nENS的使用者继续增长。与ENS的完整DNS集成于今年8月启动，因此您可以将加密货币发送到“example.com”而不是“example.eth”。\n\n此外，.eth域名也可用于构建去中心化网站。例如，以太坊联合创始人Vitalik Buterin利用这种DNS集成以及IPFS在**https://vitalik.eth/创建了一个强大且抗审查的网站。**\n\nENS或许可以在去中心化身份的未来发挥关键作用。它被注册为DID表示，允许将ENS名称包装为DID以促进互通性。许多Web3用户已经使用ENS作为他们的标识符。\n\n一项对约300名以太坊用户的调查发现，约64%的人已经拥有ENS，链上分析表明，ENS用户平均拥有2.5个域名。随着其他功能的推出（例如NFT头像支持）和dApp越来越多地采用ENS，Web3用户很可能会越来越多地使用ENS作为他们在以太坊上的身份象征。\n\n**Uniswap 上的ENS名称：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L3ixRErtHlRSQdYVYko87.png?height=86&width=640)\n\n**ENS 生态系统如下：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2q_Tq6dZopAqlanz3pPyX.png?height=502&width=592)\n\n**3. Litentry**\n\nLitentry是一个波卡（Polkadot）生态去中心化跨链身份协议，为DeFi、链上治理等Polkadot生态内外的应用提供精细化的链上身份信用服务，在区块链网络中共同打造一个可信的去中心化身份聚合器，成为Web3.0网络中的重要基础设施，为大规模应用落地做好准备。\n\n2022年10月，Litentry完成数百万美元的种子轮融资；2022年初，推出了移动端App。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0XdvDVaXME261iX3UbNOl.png?height=441&width=1221)\n\nLitentry作为跨链身份聚合器旨在将不同链上数字身份的信息进行整合，创造一个链上的身份信用体系。Litentry构建的用户信用体系可以帮助项目方识别哪些是为项目做贡献、行为良好的用户，给予更多的权利与奖励。而用户本身也会为自身名誉和利益考虑，为区块链的发展做出更多有利的行为。\n\n相比于身份赛道的其他产品，基于波卡的Litentry拥有更庞大的生态基础，应用空间也更广阔。Litentry本身还具备公开、透明、自主更新等特点，任何人都可以参与其中，并且早期参与者还能够获得一定的通证激励。\n\n对于Litentry来说，现在最重要的是完成测试网的开发，以及在平行链插槽拍卖之前或者同时上线主网。\n\n**4. Sovrin**\n\nSovrin是Evernym初始开发、Sovrin基金会运营、Hyperledger孵化开源的一种用户自主主权身份和去中心化信任的协议，它致力于提供自我主权身份的去中心化的全球公共网络，该网络于2017年7月正式启动。\n\nSovrin是一种用户主权身份的基础设施和全球可互操作的身份协议，它不是一种具体的解决方案，不依赖于特定软件实现，不同的解决方案实现厂商可基于Sovrin协议和基础设施搭建具有互操作性的平台。Sovrin定义了分层的、解耦合、模块化的模型。\n\nSovrin基金会牵头推进了Hyperledger Indy项目，提供基于区块链或其他分布式账本技术的工具、代码库和模块化组件用于实现独立的数字主权身份。\n\n2019年，从Indy项目中独立出了Hyperledger Aries项目，用于实现其中的端到端交互。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nSovrin基金会管理了一个特定的账本SovrinLedger，由Stewards操作节点与Sovrin共识协议进行通信维护，但同时Sovrin协议可以运行在任何支持上面三层的分布式账本上，不依赖于一种特定的区块链或分布式账本技术，才能形成全球可互操作的用户主权身份网络。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\nSovrin支持基于DID进行点对点相互认证和安全通信，并且在HyperledgerAries项目中孵化一套标准化的端到端交互软件基础设施，Aries项目于2019年提出。\n\nAries的功能包括：建立和使用点对点连接，发送/接收点对点协议消息，并代表模块所代表的实体执行操作。它是Sovrin基础架构的基石，通过该模块，Sovrin实体形成连接并共享Sovrin身份。点对点连接是两个Sovrin实体之间关系的基本单位，由一对仅被双方实体知道的匿名标识符组成，这样可以最大限度地避免一个实体的多个标识符被第三方归集。\n\n**（3）可验证凭证应用层**\n\n基于零知识证明的匿名凭证技术实现了可验证凭证，支持凭证信息的最小化披露。支持对一个或多个凭证中的声明进行选择、组合并出示；凭证验证方不获得数据明文或密文，而仅获得数据的密码学验证方法，因此也无法复用它来模拟另一个用户。典型例子是在不揭示实际出生日期信息的情况下，出示有关年龄情况的证明（如“18岁以上”）。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nSovrin基金会发布了治理框架，建立用于自我主权身份的分布式网络所需的治理方法。框架定义了Sovrin网络所有成员同意遵守的商业、法律和技术术语，并且规定了Sovrin基金会和成员之间的法律合同。\n\n**5. 微软 DID**\n\n微软DID是一套基于Azure云服务的分布式数字身份技术架构和基础功能，让解决方案实施商可方便的在不同区块链上实现分布式数字身份整体解决方案。微软是DIF联盟的重要成员，以标准的开源技术、协议和参考实现为主要目标。\n\n微软DID的技术架构包括区块链BAAS服务、注册DID的Layer2方法ION、隐私数据管理模块Identity Hub，均以API的形式为开发者提供服务，ION和Identity Hub还提供了开源软件。在未实现的计划中，还包括手机端的身份管理模块。\n\n通过区块链BAAS服务向不同区块链注册分布式数字身份标识，可以成为广泛使用的中间层，实现DIF的互联互通目标。\n\nION方法是SideTree协议基于比特币网络的实现，用于解决向公有链注册DID存在的效率低下问题。\n\nIdentity Hub为开发者提供了管理用户隐私数据的基础模块。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\n微软DID的基础设施不依赖于特定的分布式账本。与Azure区块链服务的设计思想一脉相承，微软DID依托于Azure云服务支持多种分布式账本协议，并且注册了基于该分布式账本的DID操作方法，对开发者隐藏分布式账本的接入细节，提供Restful API接口。\n\n**目前微软DID支持以下两个DID操作方法：**\n\n1、Ion-test：注册到比特币测试网络\n\n2、test：注册到微软数据库\n\n**同时正在开发对以下三个分布式账本的支持：**\n\n1、比特币正式网络\n\n2、通过uport的DID方法，注册到以太坊\n\n3、通过Sovrin的DID方法，注册到Sovrin网络\n\n在DID注册和查询过程中，为解决公链效率低下的问题，微软DIF联盟的几个成员发起了SideTree协议，**构建了L1层公链和L2层DID操作的分层架构：**\n\n1、L2层保存了DID操作的源数据并推送到IPFS网络，汇聚尽可能多的DID操作后锚定到L1层。\n\n2、L2层的每个“节点”各自与L1层同步，获取 Sidetree锚定交易后，拉取DID操作源数据。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fnsKT84YImRSw1C8Qkr42.jpeg?height=901&width=800)\n\n                                                             SideTree架构\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互&可验证凭证应用**\n\n微软DID中未提供完整的DID交互和可验证凭证应用软件，由开发者根据自己需求进行设计。微软DID主要为开发者提供了Identity Hub模块，它的目标是为用户存储和管理隐私数据，以增强数据表达能力的“语义数据模型”实现。在DIF的认可下，已发布了第一版开源代码。与传统的数据存储解决方案相比，Identity Hub具有去中心化的特性：\n\n**1、标准化接口：**Hub的实现厂商需要满足标准化的数据存取接口，包括为每个用户的Hub注册DID，不同用户的Hub通过DID标识符进行互操作。\n\n**2、开源：**通过开源代码，鼓励开发者运营自己的Hub。\n\nIdentity Hub支持与用户通过DID进行点对点的安全通信，遵循DIDAuth的相互认证和加密传输。\n\n**6. WeIdentity**\n\nWeIdentity是基于联盟链的可信数据交换解决方案，它是一套基于FISCO-BCOS区块链底层平台的解决方案，也是BCOS联盟链的应用场景。联盟链为各用户角色提供了接入中心，为数据交换提供了数据存证和验证功能。\n\nWeIdentity中的用户角色包括凭证发行者、凭证验证者、用户代理和用户共四种，其中用户代理一般为权威可信机构，为用户KYC并生成数字身份标识符，用户的数字身份和隐私数据托管于用户代理中。\n\n**（1）分布式账本**\n\nWeIdentity基于微众银行的FISCO-BCOS联盟链实现，其整体架构具有明显的联盟链特征。\n\n**（2）基于DID的交互**\n\n用户的数字身份标识符、个人数据均托管于用户代理中，由用户代理与凭证发行方和凭证验证方进行通信。\n\n因此，用户与其它实体之间的通信均通过用户代理进行转接。用户代理由场景选择，一个场景中一般具有一个用户代理，这个用户代理成为一个联盟链网络中的中心转接点。\n\n本方案中的数字身份标识符等同于联盟链中的身份合约，是一条链上的唯一标识，提供了链上行为的可验证和追溯特性。由于用户的实体身份和标识符通过用户代理机构绑定，用户行为可查可归集。\n\n**（3）应用层**\n\n应用层是WeIdentity解决方案的重点，以可验证凭证数据模型规范作为标准的数据组织方式并进行分享。其目的是借助区块链实现可信数据的交换，提供直接出示和链上授权两种方式。\n\n1）直接出示\n\n2）链上授权（适合用于用户代理也不能保存数据原文的情况）\n\n**.**凭证发行方产生凭证，同时上链存证凭证摘要。\n\n**.**用户向凭证验证方发行一个授权凭证，并上链存证授权凭证摘要。\n\n**.**凭证验证方向凭证发行方请求数据，出示用户授权凭证，凭证发行方进行验证。\n\n**.**验证通过后，凭证发行方与凭证验证方建立数据传输通道进行数据传输。\n\n**（4）治理框架**\n\nWeIdentity是基于场景落地的联盟链解决方案，治理方式也具有明显的联盟链特征。\n\n联盟链中，新成员加入都需要进行KYC。个人用户通过用户代理机构进行KYC和业务接入，比如使用用户代理机构提供的身份管理工具App；机构用户可通过部署区块链节点、或通过业务发起方提供开放平台的方式接入联盟链。\n\n除用户代理外，系统中还有一类具有特殊权限的权威机构。链上每个WeIdentity DID持有者（包括人，机构，或者物）都可以成为凭证发行者，但只有联盟链里面的权威机构才可以注册成为 Authority Issuer。每个注册为 AuthorityIssuer的新成员需要联盟链内其他机构投票通过。\n\n系统中还有一些联盟链的内部治理角色，如系统管理员、机构委员会等。WeIdentity的角色权限管理通过智能合约实现，不同类型的合约角色分配不同的权限。\n\n**7. Ceramic**\n\nCeramic Network是一个去中心化的、世界性的、运行Ceramic协议的节点网络，通过Libp2p点对点网络协议的专用主题进行通信。Ceramic自称由于其独特的设计，系统能够实现目前最好的水平可扩展性、吞吐量和性能。\n\nCeramic为开发者提供了类似数据库的功能，用于存储各种动态、可变的内容。这最终为开发者提供了一种Web3原生的方式，让他们可以为Dapp添加一些关键功能，如丰富的身份信息（档案、声誉、社交图表）、用户生成的内容（帖子、互动）、动态应用数据等等。\n\n在Ceramic上，每条信息都表示为一个提交日志，称为stream。每个stream都是存储在IPLD中的有向无环图 (DAG)，具有StreamID的不可变名称和StreamState的可验证状态。stream在概念上类似于Git tree，每个流都可以被视为自己的区块链、账本或事件日志。Tile Documents是一种Ceramic StreamType，经常用作身份数据（例如，个人资料、社交图、链接的社交帐户）、用户生成的内容（例如，博客文章、社交媒体）、DID文档等。\n\n该协议不依赖于任何特定的区块链。相反，它可以被概念化为“文档链”，其中验证特定文档的状态只需要用户同步文档的数据。用户不需要像大多数区块链网络（比特币、以太坊）那样同步整个网络状态。\n\nCeramic的一个关键工具是IDX，这是一种跨链身份协议，它提供了一个统一的存储库，所有应用程序都可以在其中注册和发现与用户的DID关联的数据。它可以被认为是一个去中心化的用户表。\n\n因此，IDX允许用户控制他们的身份和数据，而无需锁定任何单个应用程序，并轻松保护和跨应用程序移植他们的数据。同时，它允许开发人员构建数据丰富的应用程序，而无需强迫用户在每个应用程序上重新创建相同的数据。\n\n**（1）Sharded execution environment — 分片式执行环境**\n\n传统的区块链系统的可扩展性被限制在一个单一的全球虚拟执行环境（VM），并且单一节点的账本的状态在所有节点之间共享。\n\n与此不同的是，每个Ceramic节点作为一个单独的执行环境，用于执行计算和验证流的交易（这意味着没有全局账本）。这种\"内置的\"执行分片方法使Ceramic网络能够横向扩展，随着网络上节点数量的增加，可以对越来越多的同时进行的流交易进行并行处理。\n\n这样的设计能处理的数据规模比金融区块链上所需的吞吐量要大几个数量级。同时这种设计的另一个好处是，Ceramic Network的节点可以在离线的环境中执行数据流的交易，然后在它重新上线后与网络的其他部分的节点们同步更新。\n\n**（2）Global namespace — 全局的命名空间**\n\n由于所有的节点都是同一个Ceramic网络的一部分，Ceramic上的每一个流都存在于一个单一的全局命名空间中，它可以被任何其他节点访问或被任何其他数据流所引用。这创造了一个开放源码信息的公共数据网。\n\nCeramic的特性使静态文件能够被重组成高阶可变的数据结构，进而能够被编程为任何所需的形式，并且把结果的状态存储和复制在一个去中心化的节点网络中。Ceramic通过使用一个通用的去中心化内容计算基底，建立并扩展了IPFS文件系统和底层持久性网络，以及去中心化生态系统中的其他开放标准。\n\n**（3）Stream数据流存储实现方式概述：**\n\n系统中用户唯一的身份标识被定义为DID（去中心化的身份ID decentralized identifier）。系统使用将DID对应的所有数据流Stream信息以NoSQL的形式进行处理、存储、管理。存储信息有下面几种类型：\n\n1、Tile Document，存储JSON文件。可以被用作身份数据（档案、社交图、声誉分数、社交账户链接）、用户生成的内容（博客文章、社交媒体等）、以及聚合索引以形成集合和用户表（IDX）、DID文档、可验证的索赔等数据库替代。Tile Document仅依靠DID进行验证，对流的所有有效更新必须由控制该流的DID签署，也就是说，更新这些信息必须要用户手动授权才能完成。\n\n2、CAIP-10 Link，关联用户在任何平台和区块链上的钱包地址。它存储了一个可加密验证的身份证明，将一个区块链地址与一个DID联系起来。一个DID可以有无限数量的CAIP-10链接，将其与许多不同的区块链网络上的许多不同地址绑定。CAIP-10链接的管理也依靠DID进行验证，与Tile Document相同。\n\n3、自定义类型。除了上述2种默认类型，用户/开发者还可以自定义StreamType，并且并将其部署到自己的Ceramic Network节点。\n\n**（4）Stream数据流的授权管理方法：**\n\n1、3ID DID Method通常用于普通用户的账户。主要使用Ceramic的Tile Document 的StreamType来表示一个动态的DID文件。当3ID与IDX和3ID钥匙链结合使用时（如3ID Connect中实现的那样），一个3ID可以很容易地与任何L1或L2网络的任何数量的区块链账户进行控制。这提供了一种在所有其他平台上统一用户身份的方法。\n\n2、Key DID Method。通常用于开发者账户。一种从任何Ed25519密钥对静态生成的DID方法。密钥DID是轻量级的，但缺点是它的DID文件是不可改变的，如果它被破坏，没有能力重置密钥。\n\n3、NFT DID Method（即将推出）。用NFT的所有权作为认证，只能被其当前拥有者控制的方法。用CAIP-10 Link追踪到NFT的当前拥有者，被控制权会随当NFT的所有权发生变化时而改变。是一个适用于任何区块链上的任何NFT的DID方法。DID文件是由链上数据静态生成的。\n\n4、Safe DID Method（即将推出）。通常用于团队组织、DAO和其他多重签名钱包的实体。在任何区块链上的通过Gnosis多重签名钱包才可以控制的方法。\n\n**（5）网络中节点的职责：**\n\n1、上述的根据数据流类型的逻辑执行数据流交易。（核心职责）\n\n2、StreamState数据流状态存储。一个Ceramic节点只为它所关心的数据流保存数据流状态，这种维护过程称为 \"pinning（钉住）\"。不同的节点将为不同的数据流维护状态，但多个节点可以维护一个数据流的状态。\n\n3、提交日志存储。一个Ceramic节点维护一份它所pinning的数据流所有提交的交易的本地副本。\n\n4、持久性接口（Persistence connectors）。Ceramic节点可以选择利用一个额外的持久性存储后端来备份它正在钉住的数据流的交易。包括Filecoin、Arweave、Sia等持久性网络。\n\n5、查询响应。节点对来自客户端的流查询做出响应。如果节点有钉住数据流，它将返回响应；如果没有，它将通过libp2p向网络的其他部分询问流，然后返回响应。\n\n6、广播交易。当一个Ceramic节点成功地在一个数据流上执行了一个交易，它就会通过libp2p向网络的其他部分广播这个交易，这样其他同样钉住这个数据流的节点就可以更新他们的数据流状态来记录这个新的交易。\n\nCeramic是DID技术堆栈中的关键。一些建立在Ceramic网络并已经具有吸引力和市场契合度的项目包括：\n\n1、Boardroom：DAO的治理管理平台，使用Ceramic的平台存储提案。\n\n2、Rabbithole：通过允许人们赚取积分和加密货币来鼓励人们使用Web3项目的应用程序。Rabbithole使用Ceramic的网络将多个Web2和Web3帐户链接到一个统一的跨链DID中，并允许用户的声誉跨越其他Web3应用程序。\n\n3、ArcX：一个去中心化的应用程序，通过发行“DeFi护照”来提供链上信用评分和身份。\n\n**六 、总结与展望**\n\n微软的首席身份架构师Kim Cameron曾说，“互联网是没有身份层的”，因为互联网的寻址系统基于识别网络上的物理端点(机器)，而人并不是网络上的端点。因此，互联网没有办法唯一地识别人的身份。\n\n区块链技术的发展，帮助人们重新思考身份识别和认证的解决方案，通过使用去中心化标识符、可验证声明等技术来解决互联网身份层缺失的困境。\n\n同时，在微软、Facebook等互联网巨头的推动下，基于区块链技术的去中心化身份管理系统，将会是区块链技术应用落地最早的领域之一。\n\n相比传统数字身份系统，**去中心化数字身份具有隐私保护、可控安全、持久可用、分散化等特点，**基于属性的授权访问方式能够更好的支持开放环境下灵活的访问策略。短短几年时间，已取得了丰富的规范和技术标准化研究成果。\n\n随着标准化成果的继续拓展，未来越来越多的应用可方便、安全的切换到分布式数字身份基础设施上来，形成互联互通的互联网身份网络。\n\n随着互联网价值的涌现，我们需要强大的DID解决方案引入新的用例、来让Web3成为主流。虽然于早期阶段，但未来是光明的。并且由于DID标准的可组合性和互通性，每个新型应用带来的能量具有涟漪效应。\n\n我们预计DID解决方案将在未来几年内迅速走入大众视野，并开启Web3应用程序的下一个周期。\n\n**免责声明：本文分享内容仅作学习交流，不构成任何投资建议。**", "timestamp": 1654769416, "digest": "F3AroTTo1cgxnr8NtyJXRfP43JisZ4zjvtW2sbkP270", "contributor": "0x251C9aBcF97B5135C7eB68D1B0E0f0C8D2e48ea2"}

I like to take my sweet time travelling in, have the right music and not worry if there is a delay. I feel comfortable knowing I have time. Furthermore, I never want to arrive at any destination hurried and stressed from the anxiety rushing brings me. I prefer to make life as carefree as possible; this includes my creative process.\n\nThus, my method for interviewing is similarly very relaxed. I prefer to work via text, usually on Discord or via Twitter DMs. I will send over 3-5ish questions and then wait for a reply. I know the journey is essential. I try not to have any expectations and let the interviewee drive the pace of the interview. I respect their time, so I like to make myself available when they respond to enable the most possibilities, but I never want to seem pushy. I know how it feels to be rushed, and I'm not too fond of it.\n\nThis slow volley approach seems particularly well suited for Digital Painter and Fashion Designer @[StrangeCintia](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia).\n\n![Soul Smoker (Dark Version) by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CgZeO2Z60v0sIbn9l58HU.png?height=1600&width=1592)\n\n**Cintia:** Oh Gawd, JL, I am sorry. I forgot. I am pretty ill these days. I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. Editions can be purchased using the ‘collect’ button at the top of this interview. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654769485, "digest": "58-fqpvgoNOVx14Dui5jokK6gmjACcJW9i_mrd61FTw", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}
{"id": "q60pz19PF-zKpS2QM_yMtxpdR1Cj5m9NUN5oB4ROGMA", "title": "Running Perp-maker for Profits & Fun: Part 1", "body": "[Perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker) is an open-source market-making template for [Perpetual Protocol v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post), the most popular dApp on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/apps/defi) *(a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum)*. Anyone can use or modify the template to facilitate trades on the protocol and earn fees.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll go over what Perpetual Protocol is, the risks and rewards associated with running the bot, and how to run it locally. Due to the length of this article, we’ll cover how to run the bot on AWS and further modification suggestions in part 2. Stay tuned!\n\n## Perpetual Protocol 101\n\nFirst thing first, what is Perpetual Protocol?\n\nPerpetual Protocol is a decentralized derivative exchange (DEX) where traders can use USDC *(a USD-pegged stablecoin)* to speculate on cryptocurrency’s price movement with up to 10x leverage. At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more! You can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6KeGLlSsa-3SOSv_-S-k1.png?height=806&width=1370)\n\n### But What does “Market-making” Mean?\n\nWhenever a trade happens, there will always be two sides involved - a taker and a maker. The takers initiate a trade, and the makers provide the inventory to let the taker take.\n\nHere is a real-life example. When buying a fish from a vendor, you’re the taker of this trade as you’re the one that takes what the vendor supplies. As for the vendor, he is the maker of this trade as he prepares the inventory (fish in this example) that makes this trade possible.\n\nSimilarly, being a market-maker, or “maker,” on Perp v2 means you [provide the liquidity](https://blog.perp.fi/how-to-provide-liquidity-on-perp-v2-9064ed085d7f) (the assets) that traders can take, making the market viable. In return, you receive 80% of the transaction fees paid by the trader. For instance, if a trader opens a long position and this trade happens in the price range you set, you act as the other side of the trade - i.e., opening a short position as a result, and vice versa.\n\nMakers on Perp v2 can choose the price range to which they provide liquidity. For instance, in the screenshot below, this user wants to provide liquidity to the BTC market with a price range of $9,991.99 to $60,081.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb5f4JjKvWmd88x2iwT2L.png?height=806&width=1370)\n\nWhenever a trade happens in that range, this user collects 80% of the transaction fees proportionately. One thing worth pointing out is that USDC is the only asset you need to deposit to start market-making on Perp v2. Once you deposit some USDC, the system will mint the virtual tokens (0.1 vBTC and 4316.31 vUSD in the screenshot) you need to trade or market-make with.\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-maker\n\nWith perp-maker, anyone can automate their market-making strategy on Perp v2 to earn transaction fees and liquidity mining rewards *(more on this later)*.\n\n**Out of the box, perp-maker lets you choose which market you want to provide liquidity to and within what price range**. As a reminder, if the market price moves out of the price range you set, you will not collect any transaction fees until it moves back in the range. **Perp-maker can automatically adjust your liquidity and realize the [impermanent loss](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3) when the market price reaches the price level you set.**\n\n### But What is Impermanent Loss?\n\nOn Perp v2, makers act as the other side of each trade. If a trader makes a profit, a maker loses money. This loss is impermanent as it will become 0 when the market price returns to the initial price. Even if the market price moves away from the initial price, you can collect fees if the market price stays in the price range.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4T-vCemGHAoAu6SYZnmjR.png?height=1012&width=1908)\n\nAs a rule of thumb, **the wider the price range you set, the less [impermanent loss](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3) you suffer; however, the less transaction fees you can collect. And the more transaction fees generated on a market, the better for you as a maker.** You can use the [Perpetual Simulator](https://defi-lab-test-vhee9.ondigitalocean.app/perpetualsimulator) to simulate different price ranges in any given market to gauge the profitability of your strategy.\n\nAdditionally, **the developers behind the protocol provide its token, known as $PERP, as an extra reward to encourage more people to be makers**. This reward is distributed weekly proportional to the transaction fees you collect for that market. **This weekly reward is known as liquidity mining rewards.**\n\nTo recap - **if the transaction fees plus liquidity mining rewards outweigh the impermanent loss, it’s a profitable strategy**. If not, it can still be a profitable strategy over a more extended timeframe as it takes time for the combined value of the fees and liquidity mining rewards to catch up with the impermanent loss.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n*If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot using the readme in the [perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.*\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned how Perp v2 works and the risks and rewards of being a maker on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a perp-maker on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6QOtvjcuMi36QkSCyQLfm.png?height=1062&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer:\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N4a5KHu_9C987ll57Uyxt.png?height=782&width=1370)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node’ is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZqQ1j9QNzMjFhO46GrGPM.png?height=980&width=1024)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-maker repo and build it locally. You can do it with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker.git`\n\n`cd perp-maker`\n\n`npm i`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything works properly, you should see something on your terminal that’s similar to what’s displayed below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dIWmLkTfy6EDqLNK3H5On.png?height=496&width=1372)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mBbPh3b35FiRWt5KwFPlY.png?height=808&width=1370)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Modify .env file\n\nYou need to add a web3 endpoint and your wallet’s private key to the .env file in your perp-maker folder. Here is what it looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4-JyvjGUDUWHpm33uiKpm.png?height=872&width=1370)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).** For testing purposes, you should get an endpoint for “Optimism Kovan”, not “Optimism Mainnet” or “Kovan”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m4tW5ytUsE7qwyP66q3bt.png?height=802&width=1370)\n\n*If you’re wondering what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider e.g. Infura will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.*\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.” Similar to recovery phrases, you should never share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sXTYNdQbm1Irp0oiHOB7l.png?height=1032&width=608)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* ADJUST_MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI: The maximum gas fee in Gwei which the bot will adjust liquidity. If the gas price exceeds this number, the liquidity won't be adjusted. Currently, the gas price on Optimism is fixed at 0.001 Gwei.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to \\`true\\` to enable this market.\n* LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT:How much vUSD (after leverage) to provide as liquidity. Perp v2 supports up to 10x leverage, meaning that you can use up to 10x of your deposited USDC to provide liquidity.\n* LIQUIDITY_RANGE_OFFSET: The offset to upper price and lower price of the liquidity range. For example, if it’s set to 0.05, it will provide liquidity from (current price / 1.05) to (current price \\* 1.05).\n* LIQUIDITY_ADJUST_THRESHOLD: The threshold that the bot will remove your existing liquidity, realize the impermanent loss, and place a new price range. For example, if it’s set to 0.01, the bot will remove your existing liquidity when the current price goes out of the range below (initial price/ 1.01) or above (the initial price\\* 1.01), and subsequently provides liquidity with a new price range based on LIQUIDITY_RANGE_OFFSET and the current price.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally on Optimism Kovan (testnet)\n\nYou need to get some test tokens before running the bot on Optimism testnet. Head to [Optifaucet](https://kovan.optifaucet.com/), type in your wallet address *(which starts with 0x)* and send out the request.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/472eL25IaWpOqyc8sth44.png?height=718&width=1230)\n\n*If you run out of the test ETH to pay for transactions, you can go to [Paradigm’s faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to request more test ETH and then bridge them to Optimism Kovan via [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).*\n\nWe’re almost ready! The bot by default is set to run on Optimism. To run on Optimism Kovan, you need to add an endpoint for the testnet (as demonstrated above) and comment *(add two “slashes” before the codes)* the two lines below in the index.ts file which is located in the src folder.\n\n`// process.env[\"STAGE\"] = \"production\"`\n\n`// process.env[\"NETWORK\"] = \"optimism\"`\n\nFor Windows users, you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file:\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv):\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal to do it:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gcsUq-i2kMpXkbpk-f3d.png?height=372&width=1374)\n\nAnother way to validate if the template runs successfully is to check the target markets in the pool section on the UI. For testnet *(Optimism Kovan)*, please visit [testnet.perp.exchange](https://testnet.perp.exchange/); As for mainnet *(Optimism)*, visit [app.perp.com](https://app.perp.com/).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wTbtDlx5qj7XnJaxGMRs1.png?height=764&width=1374)\n\nAlright!

I can barely type.\n\n**JL:** No worries, Cintia, whenever you can if ever you want.\n\n**Cintia:** I want to ❤️, and I will. 🙂 When my body allows me.\n\n**JL:** I’m not in a rush, and you never need to apologise. Chill is my preferred method of operating. Take your time, whatever you need. We could also do a voice call one day? I could record and type it up if you prefer?\n\n**Cintia:** Wah, no way! Voice is even worse cause of my severe brain fog and neurocognitive issues. I'm feeling a bit better at the moment. Let me try. I don’t know how long it will last, so I'll try answering them or a few at least.\n\n**JL:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your answers. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar. I will edit it for you. So let’s start with what’s your art-making process?\n\n**Cintia:** My process is kind of random cause it depends on many things, but you could say I wait until an image pops into my mind, most of the time while listening to music, but it can also be from something I saw that stimulated me and a whole concept came out of it.\n\nThen, I listen to more music with that same \"flavour\" while sketching and completing the concept, composition and everything in my mind while I draw it. I could say I let the music do its thing, and I follow. When it's all pretty much complete concept-wise, I keep working on it cause my style and my brain kind of focus on the small details, and it usually takes more time than I'd like for me to finish a piece.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/28433)\n\n**Cintia:** I also always feel like they are all just half done, but that has more to do with my energy levels. I'd add a lot more detail and elements to all of my pieces if it weren't for that, so I learned to stop at \"finished enough\".\n\n**JL:** What kind of music do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** Oof, I can go with any song that resonates with my ears regardless of the genre but let's say I usually go for prog metal and rock, dark/synth-wave, 70s prog and rock and nostalgic oldies.\n\n**JL:** Can you give me a great song to listen to?\n\n**Cintia:** Just one? Ok, since that's very difficult, I'll go for the last one that was on my mind, and I find to be a masterpiece: WHY by HMLTD. It’s pretty representative of myself as an artist too.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uToY1uq1I)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346](https://open.spotify.com/track/70pfqOmhNtiJYKFMxpe0LY?si=a545bc703ff64346)\n\n**JL:** How so?\n\n**Cintia:** It has this mystic ghost in the shell - anime - Japanese culture vibe. And it’s the weirdest track on the album. I often like the weird ones.\n\n**JL:** How else does Japanese culture influence your work?\n\n**Cintia:** I used to watch lots of anime as a teenager, and it influenced me a ton, both conceptually and aesthetically wise! With time I acquired a lot more and new interests, and my style wasn't that anime-like anymore, but it can still be appreciated how much I like Japanese aesthetics and culture. I realised I have the most fun when the characters I design have some of these elements or stylised features I like from manga than when I go for a very realistic approach, so I will probably keep it coming and make it even more present in my future works.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/71937)\n\n**JL:** Is Whatchalookinat the first NFT you made?\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/10263)\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, it is! [Widmer](https://twitter.com/WidmerLuiz) got it.\n\n**JL:** Is it you?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, although whenever I draw something more fashionable, I can't help but show my tastes in them, so the characters often have similar haircuts and wear the stuff I'd wear myself\n\n**JL:** Is Strange Couture still operational?\n\n**Cintia:** Unfortunately not. I put the site on vacation mode in case I was able to get back to it (I still have stock of some of the final designs), but it doesn't look like it will be possible for now, so I've been thinking of just finally and permanently shutting it down. I love designing all kinds of things, and fashion is one of my favourites. I have tons of things I'd love to create. I'd totally go for footwear!\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/](https://www.strangecouture.com/)\n\n[https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet](https://www.strangecouture.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/smartass-jumpsuit-in-cerise-velvet)\n\n**JL:** What art are you working on now?\n\n**Cintia:** None in particular. Maybe my PFP project STRANGE PEOPLE, but I wouldn't consider that an art piece! I tried doing some 3D pieces to convey how my illness feels, but after a couple of them, I just relapsed. So I think I should focus on a project that will fund my surgery and try not to waste my energy. Pencil sketching once in a while helps me cope too.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia/mecfs/2)\n\n**JL:** Can you walk me through a typical day for you? Do you have a routine?\n\n**Cintia:** I wish I could have a routine, but the most similar to that I have is waking up with caffeine in mind. Try to stay for as long as I can in my office where I have this sofa-like chair. This usually lasts for 2-3h max. And then, sofa it is till bedtime.\n\n**JL:** What kind of food do you like?\n\n**Cintia:** I love simple flavours. I’m not the spice and sauces kind of person. I enjoy Japanese ramen and snacks, pasta, and simple Spanish cuisine, and I love all the things that being lactose intolerant won’t let me eat, such as chocolate, desserts and pizza, hahaha. I think that Spanish omelettes and fried eggs might be my absolute favs, along with ramen.\n\n[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/real-spanish-omelette)\n\n**JL:** Where was the last place you travelled?\n\n**Cintia:** When I went to Tokyo in 2019. Back when I could still do stuff. It was the trip of my life that I had wanted to do since I was a kid. Even if I missed some of the events, I loved the trip and can't wait to go back.\n\n**JL:** Who did you travel with?\n\n**Cintia:** I traveled with a group of my closest friends at the moment. My partner couldn’t come because of work, and that sucked. I want to go back with him so bad!\n\n**JL:** How did you and your husband get married?\n\n**Cintia:** We were approaching ten years together and said, why not make it legal? So we went ahead and did three things: First, on the exact day of our anniversary, a friend got us the rings tattooed on our fingers. Then a few months later, we went and signed the papers and a couple of months after, we had a bbq with friends. So no dresses or fancy stuff. Just jeans and a t-shirt. ❤️ I honestly can't remember who proposed or how because the idea of the tattoo and doing something for our 10th anniversary had been there for so long, I can’t remember who suggested what first.\n\n![Strange Cintia's family, left to right: Mochilo, Pisuke, and Otto.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjhQ3yGb2uDnmB_UQQJSr.png?height=648&width=974)\n\n**JL:** Do you have siblings?\n\n**Cintia:** I have a six years younger brother. He can remind you a bit of Kramer from Seinfeld. Haha, such a weirdo. My family is a tad particular. Our parents divorced when I was 7. So each side of the family has its peculiarities. My mother, unfortunately, suffers from the same condition as me, but she didn’t learn about it until much later. She also used to be a fashion designer when younger, but then she switched to gerontology. She lives with my 90-year-old grandma! And my father is a traditional oil painter who just got retired from his day job. His family is complex. I think a bestseller would come out of telling their story.\n\n**JL:** Do you journal?\n\n**Cintia:** Nah, I am too tired for that. Anyways, I'm not the kind of person who has a diary. The most similar to this is I’ve made tons of sketches. I have an entire box of sketchbooks, and you probably could see my progress as an artist and a person through them.\n\n![One of Strange Cintia's sketches](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tW_ZKfDNonKTg70mrhV9G.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\n**JL:** How often do you leave your house?\n\n**Cintia:** For the last two years, I might have left like once a month or every two months. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about my illness because I'm much more than that, but it’s a constant in my daily life. It affects everything, so it can’t help but sneak into many of my replies.\n\n**JL:** I know. You are doing great. Where do you go?\n\n**Cintia:**  Sometimes, I go to this bar 1 minute away to grab a coffee with my husband, mother, or some close friend. A few times, I went downtown (10 minutes by foot) if there was a friend's birthday or lunch that I could manage.  I was also able to attend a couple of family gatherings, like once or two a year. Most of the time, though, it’s to the doctors.\n\n**JL:** Nice to be a bit social. What do you do on your birthday?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, I like being social and miss my friends a lot! I think this year, I was unable to do anything. Wait, no, I did. We had lunch with a few friends at a Korean restaurant close to home.\n\n**JL:** Do you think discord and Twitter scratch the social itch?\n\n**Cintia:** Yes, they are the closest for now, but it's still lacking cause I can't meet my best friends in real life.\n\n![Alizzz & Meowww in Technicolorland by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uSCTzOxzMtsux0JBrOefT.png?height=2160&width=3372)\n\n**JL:** How did you meet [Yam](https://twitter.com/YKarkai) and get involved with [WoW](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft)?\n\n**Cintia:** This is still pretty surreal. Yam actually reached out to me even before the project launched, saying she wanted to donate to help me along with two other causes. At the time, 10k projects were relatively new, and I had no idea what that was going to imply. It was all a lot more than I could have ever expected, and I am super thankful to her and all the team. I am incredibly proud and grateful for the eth raised and donated by Wow. Feels like another family of my own here in the NFT space.\n\n**JL:** How much more do you need to fund your surgery and recovery?\n\n**Cintia:** Let’s see I’ve raised the WoW donation plus the few 0.25 sales I made of my blind girl editions. Hard to say, especially since today I had confirmation that I'll probably need two surgeries that most patients undergo instead of just spinal surgery (craniocervical fusion). I will need around 100k or more since the post-op can last up to 1 year, and we have no idea what kind of expenses we will stumble upon. The most recent test was 7k euro in the end. I will probably need five times what I have now.\n\n[https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w](https://twitter.com/StrangeCintia/status/1534521692164345856?s=20&t=qk1zlPwpybJ1TVbb4Too_w)\n\n**JL:** I feel like ‘What I Need, I Eat’ has been on every platform. It's had quite the journey. What are your hopes for it?\n\n**Cintia:** It was first in [FND.](https://foundation.app/@strangecintia) I wanted it to be a 1/1 for charity, but I didn’t have enough endorsement or fanbase nor the support of the platform to make that happen. Then I moved it to [MP](https://makersplace.com/strangecintia/) as a 50 Edition work. I sold like 15 of them, but it was costly to list every edition, and I recently moved the remaining editions to [OS](https://opensea.io/collection/winieat). This was my last resort to keep gathering funds through my paintings, every edition I sold, I sent the funds straight to my ledger.\n\n![What I Need, I Eat by Strange Cintia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3v8x2yuRjcZKiQWNNVzy.png?height=782&width=600)\n\n**Cintia:** Things have changed, though, and it could now be considered too expensive for a multi-edition, so I know it won't probably sell out at all. I hope I can gather the funds by other means, and when that happens, I'll burn these remaining editions.\n\n**JL:** You have also done some collecting too. Do you have a flipper’s mentality?\n\n**Cintia:** That's not what I want to do in the future, but it’s what I am doing for the moment. It’s comforting knowing I have like 6-8 eth easily with my assets.\n\n**JL:** Are you in a better position now, than you were at the start of your NFT journey? Is life a little easier?\n\n**Cintia:** Well, yes, I was able to get rid of some stressing factors like debts, and we were able to buy stuff I needed like a good mattress and stuff that makes daily life easier.\n\n**JL:** Well, I hope the interview will help too. Thanks for answering my questions.\n\n**Cintia:** No, thank you. I’m honoured!\n\n![Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXV0fL_myHfB7LzYiNn9H.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\nAs I said at the start I never like to rush my process. I enjoy getting to know the people I interview and paint slowly over time. I realize that’s a choice I can make. It’s tough thinking Cintia physically can’t rush anything and she desperately wants to. She is at the mercy of her body and constantly has to make choices on what she can attempt and accomplish. Still, despite her health limitations, she keeps looking forward and working towards her goals as fast as she can.\n\nI encourage you to read more about her condition (ME/CFS or [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis](https://meassociation.org.uk/about-what-is-mecfs/)  / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), her journey and more ways to support [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cintia-get-her-life-back-save-her-art?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1v&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer).\n\nAll edition sales of this interview will go directly to Cintia to help fund her recovery. All editions holders will be entered into a raffle for the Portrait of Strange Cintia and Lil Mochilo by JL Maxcy on FND. The raffle will be held on the last day of NFT NYC 2022 on June 23rd, timing to be announced via Twitter.\n\nSee the link to prize NFT on Foundation below. Each 0.01 eth spent on editions of this mirror article is a ticket into the raffle.  0.01 ETH= 1 ticket,  0.1 ETH= 10 tickets and 1 ETH = 100 tickets. Editions can be purchased using the ‘collect’ button at the top of this interview. I do hope you will join in the fun to help a great artist, sweet friend, loving wife, and cat mom reclaim her health in the process.\n\n[https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3](https://foundation.app/@JLMaxcy/waf/3)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654769589, "digest": "58-fqpvgoNOVx14Dui5jokK6gmjACcJW9i_mrd61FTw", "contributor": "0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF"}

{"id": "grBJMX1SysuQBPqHfXxJd9Oe-jng6kIQQJ7hDvH21sw", "title": "Arbitraging Between DEXes and CEXes for Profits & Fun", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oVM09P-0E8Gi-T1conx-Y.png?height=1012&width=1908)\n\n[Perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur) is an open-sourced template that automatically executes your arbitrage strategy between Perpetual Protocol v2 “Curie” and FTX.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll cover what [Perpetual Protocol v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) is, the risks and rewards of running this bot, how you can run it on your computer and on AWS, and further modification suggestions.\n\n## Perpetual Protocol 101\n\nPerpetual Protocol, or Perp v2 “Curie” specifically, is a decentralized derivative exchange (DEX) on [Optimism](https://optimism.io) where traders can use USDC *(a USD-backed stablecoin)* to speculate on cryptocurrency’s price movement with up to 10x leverage. You can open a long position if you believe one asset’s price will go up or open short positions if you expect it will go down. At the time of writing, the DEX supports 17around 20 markets, including BTC, ETH, ATOM, BNB, and more!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J8zu2hqPwpMn4gBJxvyZO.png?height=790&width=1370)\n\nYou can learn how it works in detail by watching this [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoKtkoNZEY) or reading [this article](https://cryptotesters.com/blog/perp-protocol).\n\n## Risks and Rewards of Running Perp-curie-arbitrageur\n\nThe way **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)** works is that, whenever there is a price difference between [Perp v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) (a derivative DEX) and [FTX](https://ftx.com/) (a CEX), the bot will buy on the cheaper side and sell on the more expensive side. Out of the box, this template allows you to set the desired price difference for the bot to take action. Additionally, you can specify the markets for the bot to run the arbitrage strategy.\n\nOf course, we can’t just look at the rewards. How about the risks associated with running this bot?\n\nThe main risk is liquidation, which can happen when you use too much leverage to trade on either Perp v2 or FTX. Luckily, the bot lets you set the margin ratio you’re comfortable with, which is the reciprocal of leverage, and it will start to reduce the position sizes whenever the margin ratio is reached.\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\n***If you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you should have no problem setting up the bot by the readme in the [perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker/) repo.***\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned what Perp v2 is and the risks and rewards of running an arbitraging bot on the platform. This section will go through the steps to set up a bot on your computer. You can join our Discord server where we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.\n\nFirst, you need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, which comes along with the Node Package Manager (npm) that we need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35K8a0HNOpAgrqyZe8-9u.png?height=1056&width=1370)\n\nOnce installed, you can type the following commands in your terminal (Terminal for macOS or Command Prompt for Windows) to check both software versions on your computer.\n\n`node -v`\n\n`npm -v`\n\nYou should see similar responses on your screen, like the screenshot below. There might be some differences between your version and mine, but you’ll be fine if the npm version is at least seven and Node.js is at least 16.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmWcwfTH5meqjcgJXX42B.png?height=772&width=1368)\n\nFor Windows users, if you see an error message of “‘node is not recognized as an internal or external command,” you need to modify your Environment Variables. You can search “Environment Variables” on your PC and add the location where you installed Node.js in the PATH. My installed location is at “C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FG5l25__gsXRy2WqTwan9.png?height=976&width=1026)\n\nThen you need to install Git on your computer. You can visit [this site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to see the install guide for each OS. For those who want to learn more about Git, you can watch [this 100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) to know more about it. Once installed, type the following command in your terminal to verify it’s working:\n\n`git --version`\n\n*Again, for Windows users, if you run into an error that starts with “git is not recognized as an internal or external command…”, you need to edit your Environment Variables as we previously did for Node.js.*\n\nNow, we will clone the perp-curie-arbitrageur repo and build it locally. You can do so with the following commands in your terminal:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur.git`\n\n`cd perp-curie-arbitrageur`\n\n`npm install`\n\n`npm run build`\n\nIf everything goes well, you should be able to see responses like the ones below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oHajKZfB6oCOvhrfk_ln.png?height=420&width=1366)\n\nThe last thing in this section is that you need to download a cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) as it’s the world’s most popular browser wallet. During onboarding, you’ll be asked to save 12 recovery phrases. You should **never** share these with anyone under any circumstances, especially those who claim to be part of a customer service team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AZkHnVO2PIpDf7g12I2Ix.png?height=808&width=1366)\n\n## Get the Tokens you Need\n\nThere are two tokens we need in order to run perp-curie-arbitrageur. They are ETH and USDC. **Please be aware that, since there is no test account on FTX, we’ll be using real ETH and USDC in the following**. It’s better to start with a small amount to get comfortable with it and then increase from there.\n\n* **For ETH**:\n\n  If you only use CEXes like Binance or FTX, you can use [LayerSwap](https://www.layerswap.io/) to transfer some of your ETH to Optimism. If you have ETH on chains like Ethereum or BNB Chain, you can use [TransferTo.xyz](https://transferto.xyz/swap) to bridge your ETH to Optimism. **ETH is used to pay the gas fees for your transactions** and each transaction on Perp v2 costs around 0.001 ETH, so even 0.1 ETH can be used for a long time.\n* **For USDC**:\n\n  Similar to ETH, you can use either LayerSwap or TransferTo depending on how much you want to transfer and from where. And as mentioned above, **USDC is used as the collateral for your positions**.\n\nAlso, because by default, MetaMask doesn’t include Optimism in the network list, you need to go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to add Optimism to your MetaMask to see your ETH and USDC balance in your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni590TmTaReallO5-aRV6.png?height=764&width=1366)\n\n## Configure the Bot: Local Variables and Strategy\n\nAt this point, we’re just a few adjustments away from running the bot locally.\n\n### Rename the .env.example file to .env and modify it\n\nYou need to rename the .env.example file in the root folder of perp-curie-arbitrageur to .env and add a web3 endpoint, your wallet’s private key, and everything related to FTX to it. Here is what your .env file looks like once it’s done:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TBM7eUvmNl8RN63gTvlWy.png?height=386&width=1366)\n\n**For a web3 endpoint for Optimism, you can obtain it by creating a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)**. If you wonder what a web3 endpoint is, it’s where this bot submits your transaction. The endpoint provider, e.g. Infura, will broadcast your transaction to blockchain miners/validators upon reception, who will later validate your transaction and add it to the blockchain's latest block.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/74kJqYT6TE7k7ntWyKUE8.png?height=796&width=1366)\n\n**As for the private key, you can export it from your MetaMask** by clicking the more button *(besides your wallet address)*, clicking “Account details,” then “Export Private Key.”  Similar to recovery phrases, you should **never** share your private key. It’s recommended that you use a new MetaMask account rather than the one that you’ve been using for trades.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uI8QlZXgLQLdkFhHl6ucq.png?height=950&width=560)\n\nAs for FTX’s API key and secret, you can generate them by going to the [API page](https://ftx.com/settings/api) of your subaccount and clicking \"Create API Key”. The permission should be “Trading” only.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XQOmbcYNb_-sCsYEVNr-c.png?height=454&width=820)\n\n### Modify config.json file\n\nNext up, we need to modify the parameters in the config.json file, which sits in the configs subfolder of the src folder, to create our strategy.\n\nHere are the parameters that you need to determine and the respective description in the config file:\n\n* PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check the price in seconds.\n* BALANCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency to check your balance on FTX and your address.\n* ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH:\n* BALANCE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH: The maximum amount of gas fees in ETH that you’re willing to pay to do arbitrage. One thing worth pointing out is that , Optimism uses the first-comes, first-served approach to process transactions, meaning that increasing the ARBITRAGE_MAX_GAS_FEE_ETH will not confirm any faster.\n* PERP_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_MIN_MARGIN_RATIO: As we mentioned above, the margin ratio is the metric to show how many leverages you use. The lower this metric, the easier for your position to get liquidated.  If you set them as 0.2, then the max leverage is 5x. Recommended to start from 1 to be safe.\n* PERP_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO:\n* FTX_EMERGENCY_MARGIN_RATIO: The margin ratio threshold when the positions on both platforms will start to be reduced. For instance, if you set them as 0.1 here, that means your positions will begin to be closed when your leverage reaches 10x. Recommended to begin with a number that is closer to 1 to start with.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_AMOUNT: 9000,\n  The USD value of the position that the bot should start to close when the emergency margin ratio is reached.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_SLEEP_SEC: The interval between each emergency reduction should be.\n* EMERGENCY_REDUCE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC: The frequency that emergency checks should be conducted.\n* IS_ENABLED: Set to true to enable this market.\n* FTX_MARKET_NAME: The name of the market on FTX. Usually, if it’s a perpetual market, then it’ll follow a naming convention of ticker-perp. For instance, BTC’s perpetual market is known as BTC-PERP on FTX.\n* ORDER_AMOUNT: Order amount in USDC for each trade. Remember to top up your account before running the bot.\n* SHORT_TRIGGER_SPREAD:\n* LONG_TRIGGER_SPREAD: The price difference threshold between both platforms at which the bot should start executing your strategy.\n* IS_EMERGENCY_REDUCE_MODE_ENABLED:\n  Whether (or not) the bot should reduce positions when the leverage is too high.\n\nWe use vBTC *(BTC market)* and vPERP *(PERP market)* as the target markets in the config file by default. However, the bot can support up to 5 markets simultaneously. You can check the list of markets on Perp v2 from [the UI](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post) or [this JSON file](https://metadata.perp.exchange/v2/optimism.json).\n\n## Run Locally\n\nThere is one extra step for Windows users - you need to add additional two lines below above the `initLog()` in the index.ts file otherwise it can’t read the parameters in your .env file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nIf there is any error saying dotenv isn’t installed, you can run the command below in your terminal to [install dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).\n\n`npm install dotenv --save`\n\nNow, we’re all set! For macOS users, type the command below to run the bot locally:\n\n`env $(cat .env | grep -v '#' | xargs) npm run start`\n\nFor Windows users, type the command below in your terminal:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIf it runs successfully on your machine, you should be able to see similar responses on your terminal:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5Go3tdgnLsHOHaraBjw0.png?height=564&width=1022)\n\n## Run on AWS Lambda\n\n*If you’re not familiar with AWS Lambda, you can watch this video to [learn more about it (or serverless in general) in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_VV2Fx32_Y&ab_channel=Fireship). But in general, the main selling point of AWS’ Lambda is that, instead of renting a dedicated server on AWS to run your program 24/7. You only pay the times when your application runs on a shared server, which is more suitable for our use case as the bot only runs from time to time based on your settings.*\n\nAs a starter for this section, **you need to register an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and install AWS CLI on your machine**. Check the installation instructions for each OS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).\n\n**Once AWS CLI is installed, you need to [configure your AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) by running the following command** in your Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows):\n\n`aws configure`\n\nThen you need to type your access key and secret. You can create them from the [Identity and Access Management page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oY3trcl2-nanWI5PxCV5L.png?height=258&width=1178)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YStXJ4AHlHEkI_b9QQTuw.png?height=686&width=1218)\n\nDepending on your settings, sometimes you need to create a new user on AWS to generate a key. To do so, you need to click Users on the Identity and Access Management page and then create a new user with permission to manage Lambda.\n\n**Following this, you need to type the AWS region you use in the .env file in your perp-curie-arbitrageur folder**. For instance, add AWS_REGION=ap-southest-1 to the file if you choose a server located in Singapore.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i13sUcuIHcQhUTzwfacHo.png?height=686&width=1228)\n\nAlso, for Windows users who have run the bot locally in the previous sections, you need to remove the two lines that you added in the index.ts file.\n\n`import dotenv from \"dotenv\";`\n\n`dotenv.config();`\n\nBy now we’re all set! Enter the following commands in your terminal to deploy the bot to AWS:\n\n`npm run build`\n\n`npm run sls:deploy`\n\nYou should be able to see the following responses if everything goes well:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HgxYHicK9JFy_6nU9HplL.png?height=490&width=1228)\n\nOnce your bot is running, you can see the real-time logs by going to the *perp-arbitrageur-production-main* Lambda function on AWS and clicking the “View logs in CloudWatch” under the Monitor tab. You should be able to see similar logs when running the bot on your computer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KmdiO6etAAGga9RGrOsYr.png?height=716&width=1228)\n\nCongratulations! Your bot is now automatically arbitraging the price difference between Perp v2 and FTX!\n\n## Further Modification Suggestions\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article, this bot is just a template for arbitraging between Perp v2 and FTX. Given the nature of an open-sourced software, anyone can add functionalities to this bot. Below are some directions that you can explore:\n\n* **Support more DEXes and CEXes**\n\n  You can modify the bot to support for CEXs like Binance or Huobi to discover more arbitraging opportunities. It also applies to derivative DEXs as there are numerous of them on the market.\n* **Better position wind down process**\n\n  Currently, the bot will close positions from both exchanges when the margin ratio reaches the limit you set. A better approach to wind down positions should be closing both sides when the prices on both exchanges are the same and do it gradually to reduce price impact aka slippage per trade.\n* **Error or success report**\n\n  Right now the bot only does its job quietly and you can only check CloudWatch to know its status. One way to improve this is to add a script to send out a Telegram or Discord message when certain criteria are met. For instance, you can write a script to send out Telegram messages when a trade is successful.\n\nThat’s the end of our tutorial on how to run **[perp-curie-arbitrageur](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-arbitrageur)**!\n\n**Besides this tutorial, recently we also have released tutorials on how to run [perp-maker](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-maker)!** Feel free to check them out.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/LWB40sjbmk4R34eq2ZD88vm466wAZ7iiskalKWGVPXc](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/LWB40sjbmk4R34eq2ZD88vm466wAZ7iiskalKWGVPXc)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/Om0vxOZKa3LTp22_fVhzMxrVPZ2blticcdmPzIrjkj4](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/Om0vxOZKa3LTp22_fVhzMxrVPZ2blticcdmPzIrjkj4)\n\n**One last thing - we have a [#coding-chat channel](https://discord.gg/M7y2VFqwCb) on our Discord for questions you encounter when building on top of Perp v2.

The validators grow the blockchain by executing transactions, producing blocks and achieving consensus. The rest of the peers in the network (e.g., fullnodes and clients) replicate the blockchain data produced by the validators (e.g., blocks and transactions). State sync is the protocol that allows non-validator peers to distribute, verify and persist this blockchain data and ensures that all peers in the ecosystem are synchronized. See the diagram below for what this looks like at Aptos.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XesMBhS5rLVIiluTme0nlw.png)\n\nAptos Ecosystem (Overview)\n\n## Why does state sync matter?\n\nState sync is rarely mentioned when evaluating blockchains: it is often a footnote in a whitepaper dedicated to more interesting topics\\*. However, state sync has significant consequences on blockchain performance, security, and user experience. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Time to finality and user experience:** When new transactions are executed by validators, state sync is responsible for propagating the data to peers and clients. If state sync is slow or unreliable, peers will perceive long transaction processing delays, artificially inflating the time to finality. This has a huge impact on user experience, e.g., decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and payment processing will all be much slower.\n2. **Relationship with consensus:** Validators that crash or fall behind the rest of the validator set rely on state sync to bring them back up to speed (i.e., synchronize the latest blockchain state). If state sync cannot process transactions as quickly as they are executed by consensus, crashed validators will never be able to recover. Moreover, new validators will never be able to start participating in consensus (as they won’t ever catch up!) and fullnodes will never be able to sync to the latest state (they’ll continue to fall further behind!).\n3. **Implications on decentralization**: Having a quick, efficient and scalable state sync protocol allows for: (i) faster rotations of an active validator set, as validators can move in and out of consensus more freely; (ii) more potential validators to choose from in the network; (iii) more fullnodes to come online quickly and without having to wait long periods of time; and (iv) lower resource requirements, increasing heterogeneity. All of these factors increase decentralization in the network and help to scale the blockchain in size and geography.\n4. **Data correctness**: State sync is responsible for verifying the correctness of all blockchain data during synchronization. This prevents malicious peers and adversaries in the network from modifying, censoring or fabricating transaction data and presenting it as valid. If state sync fails to do this (or does it incorrectly), fullnodes and clients could be tricked into accepting invalid data and this would have devastating consequences on the network.\n\n## Reasoning about state sync\n\nTo better reason about state sync, we first introduce a generic model for blockchain execution. While this model targets the Aptos blockchain specifically, it can be generalized to others.\n\nWe model the Aptos blockchain as a simple versioned database, where at each version **V** there is a unique blockchain state **Sⱽ** containing all on-chain accounts and resources. A transaction **T** can be executed by the Aptos virtual machine (VM) on state **Sⱽ** to produce a state delta \\*\\*Dᵀᵥ \\*\\*representing all state modifications that would occur on \\*\\*Sⱽ \\*\\*should \\*\\*T \\*\\*be committed. When **Dᵀᵥ** is applied to **Sⱽ** (that is, we consider **T** committed), it results in a new version **V+1** and a new blockchain state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We refer to the very first blockchain state as the genesis state **S⁰**. The diagrams below show transaction execution and state delta application.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZwNwY2c1kg8mYrQ-pmHziA.png)\n\nTransaction Execution and State Delta Application (Model)\n\n## What are the goals?\n\nWith a generic model in place, we can now define several fundamental goals for state sync\\*\\*:\n\n1. **High-throughput**: State sync should maximize the amount of transactions that can be synchronized by each peer per second. That is, maximize the rate of state transitions from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹** for each \\*\\*T \\*\\*committed by the validators. If throughput is low it increases syncing time and becomes a bottleneck for the network.\n2. **Low latency**: State sync should minimize the time it takes up-to-date peers to synchronize new transactions committed by validators. That is, minimize the time it takes peers at **Sⱽ** to sync to **Sⱽ⁺¹**, for each **T** that is newly committed by the validators. This affects the overall time to finality perceived by clients.\n3. **Fast bootstrapping time**: State sync should minimize the time it takes new (or crashed) peers to sync to the latest state of the blockchain. That is, minimize the time it takes to sync to \\*\\*Sⱽ \\*\\*(where **V** is the highest database version agreed by the validators) regardless of the peer’s current version **P** and state **Sᴾ**. This allows peers to perform useful work more quickly (e.g., respond to balance queries or validate transactions).\n4. **Resistance to failures and malicious actors:** State sync should be resistant to failures (e.g., machine and network failures) and tolerate malicious actors in the network, including other peers. This means overcoming a wide-variety of attacks, e.g., fabricated transaction data, modified or replayed network messages, and [eclipse attacks](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin).\n5. **Tolerant of resource constraints and heterogeneity:** State sync should tolerate resource constraints (e.g., CPU, memory and storage) and embrace heterogeneity. Given the nature of decentralized networks, peers will have access to different types of hardware and optimize for different goals. State sync should account for this.\n\n## The required building blocks\n\nWe next introduce a set of fundamental building blocks required to construct a state sync protocol. For the sake of brevity, we provide a summary of each building block below and defer the technical details to future work (each of these could be a blogpost, itself!):\n\n1. **Persistent storage:** To persist data across machine crashes and failures (and enable data distribution to other peers!) we require that each peer has access to trusted persistent storage. At Aptos, we’re currently using [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) but are actively exploring other options.\n2. **Verifiable blockchain data:** To prevent malicious actors from modifying blockchain data, we require data to be authenticated and verifiable. Specifically, we need to be able to prove: (i) every transaction **T** that has been executed and committed by validators; (ii) the order of every transaction **T** executed and committed by validators; and (iii) the resulting blockchain states **Sⱽ** after committing each transaction **T**. At Aptos, we achieve this by: (i) building [merkle trees](https://aptos.dev/basics/basics-merkle-proof/) over committed transactions and the resulting blockchain states; and (ii) having validators sign the merkle roots of these trees to authenticate them.\n3. **A root of trust:** Given that Aptos supports dynamic validator sets (i.e., changes to validators at each epoch), peers need to be able to identify the current validator set from a verified history of the Aptos blockchain. We achieve this through: (i) a **genesis blob** authenticated by Aptos, which identifies the first validator set and initial blockchain state **S⁰**; and (ii) a **recent** **trusted waypoint** (e.g., a hash of the current validator set and blockchain state **Sⱽ**). Together, the genesis blob and waypoint form a root of trust allowing peers to synchronize the real Aptos blockchain and prevent attacks (e.g., [long-range attacks](https://dlt-repo.net/long-range-attack-in-proof-of-stake-pos-blockchains/)).\n\n## Achieving 1k TPS: A naive approach\n\nUsing the model and building blocks presented above, we can now illustrate a naive state sync protocol. This protocol is a simplification of the original protocol used by Aptos (i.e., `state sync v1`).\n\nThe protocol works as follows: (i) `Alice` (the syncing peer) identifies the highest local persisted blockchain version **V** and state **Sⱽ**. If none exists, `Alice` uses genesis, i.e., **S⁰**; (ii) `Alice` then randomly selects a peer, `Bob`, and requests any new sequential transactions that have been committed by the validators; (iii) if `Alice` receives a response from `Bob`, `Alice` will verify the new transactions (\\*\\*T⁰ \\*\\*to **Tᴺ**) and execute them to produce state delta’s (**D⁰ᵥ** to **Dᵀᵥ**₊ₙ); (iv) `Alice` will then apply the new state delta’s to storage along with the new transactions, updating the local state of the blockchain from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹⁺ᴺ**. `Alice` repeats this loop indefinitely. Pseudocode for the protocol looks as follows:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BNHW7j2GMZYb9pGe1lFvgw.png)\n\nState Sync v1 (Pseudocode)\n\nWe implemented this protocol at Aptos, benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), and analyzed it. Some of the key observations we made were:\n\n1. **Throughput is network latency bound**: This protocol achieves a maximum of `~1.2k TPS`. However, throughput is heavily affected by network latencies as `Alice` requests data sequentially and must wait for the peer to respond. Given that we’re seeing an average network round trip time (RTT) of `150ms` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), this is suboptimal.\n2. **CPU is dominated by execution**: When `Alice` receives a new set of transactions to synchronize, we see that `55%` of the CPU time is spent executing the transactions and `40%` is spent verifying the data, applying the state deltas to storage and persisting the new transactions. The other `5%` is attributed to message handling, serialization and other tasks.\n3. **Latency is high**: When running the network at maximum load, the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~900 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is primarily due to `Alice` randomly selecting peers when requesting data and not taking into account the network topology: peers that are closer to the validators will receive new transactions sooner.\n4. **Bootstrapping is slow**: The protocol above requires `Alice` to replay and synchronize all transactions since genesis. If `Alice` is far behind the latest state, she must wait a long period of time before being able to do anything useful (this might take hours or even days!).\n5. **Performance is easily manipulated**: The performance of this protocol is heavily influenced by malicious peers. As identified in 1 above, intentionally slow (or non-responsive) peers will force `Alice` to spend long periods of time waiting for data and not doing anything. Thus, significantly increasing synchronization time.\n6. **Resource usage is high**: This protocol is expensive for all resource types: (i) CPU usage is high because `Alice` must re-execute all transactions; (ii) storage is high because `Alice` must store all transactions and blockchain states since genesis; and (iii) network usage is high because `Alice` must receive all transactions since genesis via the network. This automatically imposes high costs and resource requirements, reducing heterogeneity.\n7. **Resources are wasted**: While `Alice` is synchronizing new data, peers in the network are also synchronizing from her. As the number of peers requesting data from `Alice` grows, there is an additional read load placed onto storage and CPU required to handle these requests. However, much of the computation that `Alice` performs to handle these requests is wasteful as peers are often requesting the same data.\n\n## Achieving 10k TPS: An optimized approach\n\nLooking at the naive protocol above, we can make a number of modifications to help address the limitations. First, we extend the protocol to support 2 additional modes of synchronization:\n\n1. **State delta syncing**: Given that validators already execute transactions and attest to the resulting blockchain states through merkle proofs, peers can rely on the state deltas produced by the validators to skip transaction execution. This avoids: (i) the high cost of execution, reducing CPU time by about `55%`; and (ii) the need for an Aptos VM, greatly simplifying a delta syncing implementation. As a result, peers can now synchronize by downloading each transaction **T** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** and applying them to storage to produce the new state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We note that this comes at the cost of increased network usage (by approx. `2.5x`).\n2. **Blockchain snapshot syncing**: Given that validators attest to each blockchain state **Sⱽ**, we can further reduce bootstrapping time by allowing peers to download the latest blockchain state directly (instead of having to produce it using transactions or state deltas). This significantly reduces bootstrapping time and is a similar approach to [snap-sync](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/) in Ethereum. The trade-off is that peers will not store any transactions or blockchain states prior to **Sⱽ**.\n\nNext, we implement a number of general optimizations and additional features to help improve performance and scalability:\n\n1. **Data prefetching**: To prevent network latencies from impacting throughput, we can perform data prefetching. Peers can prefetch transaction data (e.g., transactions and state deltas) from other peers before processing them, amortizing network latencies.\n2. **Pipelined execution and storage**: To further increase syncing throughput, we can separate transaction execution from storage persistence and use pipelining: a commonly used [optimization in processor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-and-architecture-pipelining-set-1-execution-stages-and-throughput/) design. This allows a transaction **T²** to be executed while a transaction **T¹** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** are concurrently persisted to storage.\n3. **Peer monitoring and reputation:** To improve observability and better tolerate malicious peers, we can implement a peer monitoring service to: (i) monitor peers for malicious behaviors (e.g., transferring invalid data); (ii) identify metadata about each peer, such as a summary of all transaction data the peer has and their perceived distance from the validator set; and (iii) maintain a local score for each peer. This information can then be used to optimize peer selection when requesting new blockchain data.\n4. **Data caching**: To reduce the read load on storage and prevent state sync from performing redundant computations as more and more peers synchronize, we can implement a data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory.\n5. **Storage pruning:** To prevent storage from continuously growing over time (e.g., as more transactions are committed), we can also implement dynamic pruners to remove unnecessary transaction and blockchain data from storage, e.g., anything older than a few days, weeks or months, depending on the peer configuration.\n\nWe implemented these modifications and produced a new state sync protocol (i.e., `state sync v2`). We benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) and observed:\n\n1. **Throughput increased by 5x-10x**: When executing transactions, the protocol now achieves a maximum of `~4.5k TPS`, primarily as a result of pipelining and data prefetching (i.e., the protocol is now able to fully saturate the CPU). When synchronizing state deltas the protocol achieves well over `10K TPS`, a further result of avoiding transaction execution. In both cases, throughput is no longer affected by network latency.\n2. **Latency was reduced by 3x**: While running the network at maximum load, we now see that the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~300 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is due to data prefetching and more efficient peer selection: peers who are more responsive and closer to the validators are contacted more frequently.\n3. **Bootstrapping is significantly faster**: Peers who use blockchain snapshot syncing are able to bootstrap much more quickly. Moreover, bootstrapping time is no longer affected by the length of the blockchain (i.e., the number of transactions), but rather the number of on-chain resources to synchronize. Currently in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), peers can bootstrap within minutes\\*\\*\\*.\n4. **Resource requirements are reduced**: With multiple synchronization modes and storage pruning, resource requirements have been reduced. Moreover, there is now support for heterogeneity as peers have flexibility to select the syncing strategy. For example: (i) peers with limited CPU can skip transaction execution; (ii) peers with limited storage can configure the pruner to be aggressive; and (iii) peers that wish to get up-to-date quickly can perform blockchain snapshot syncing.\n5. **Resources are more efficiently used**: When handling syncing requests from peers, we see a significantly reduced read load on storage and less wasted CPU. This is due to the new data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory. We also see that as the number of syncing peers grows in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), the data cache becomes more efficient, e.g., with `20` syncing peers we see a cache hit rate of `70%-80%` per request. But, with `60` peers we see a cache hit rate of `93%-98%`. This comes at the cost of an additional `~150 MB` of RAM to maintain the cache.\n\n## 100k TPS and beyond?\n\nWhile we’ve already improved throughput by 10x and latency by 3x, we realize that there is still more to be done. Especially if we want to match [Block-STM](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/block-stm-how-we-execute-over-160k-transactions-per-second-on-the-aptos-blockchain-3b003657e4ba) and make *Aptos a Layer 1 for everyone*!\n\nSo, how are we going to get there? Well, we’ve already started on our next state sync goal: 100k+ TPS! Although, we’re planning to save the details for a future blogpost we did want to provide some hints to the very keen reader:\n\n1. **Transaction** **batching**: Currently, Aptos treats every transaction as verifiable, i.e., the merkle proofs used to authenticate and verify data operate at the transaction granularity. This makes verification and storage incredibly expensive. One way to avoid this is to perform transaction batching, i.e., proofs over batches (or blocks!) of transactions.\n2. **网络压缩**网络庆点对的问题，Aptos。目前显示的，同时预取将在之前`~45K TPS`免于[devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/)中取回。可以出来的，以低效的网络传播量数据，将数据也传输出去`10x`。\n3. **更快的存储写入：**目前，将区块链数据保存到存储所需的时间成为状态同步吞吐量的瓶颈。我们正在积极寻找不同的优化和改进来消除这个瓶颈，包括：(i) 更高效的数据结构；(ii) 更优化的存储配置；(iii) 备用存储引擎。\n4. **并行数据处理**：到目前为止，我们要求状态同步处理数据顺序（例如，处理顺序增加版本的事务）。但是，有许多现有的方法可以让我们避免这种要求并利用并行数据处理来显着提高吞吐量，例如区块链分片！\n\n直到下一次！\n\n*如果您像我们一样热衷于设计算法、将它们付诸实践并对 Web3 的未来产生真正的影响，请联系我们——我们正在Aptos[招聘](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/)*。\n\n\\*像共识一样 :)\\*\\*我们隐含地假设状态同步必须同步**所有链上资源**的状态。部分同步策略（例如，针对特定帐户的轻客户端）超出了范围，将在未来进行讨论。\\*\\*\\*这个指标应该用一堆盐来衡量。Aptos [devnet 每两周](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/)擦除一次，因此同步的状态有限。[运行时间更长的网络（例如，我们的激励测试网](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-roadmap-209be695c77c)）需要更多的评估。", "timestamp": 1654770083, "digest": "BRyLLScm6tXT2iXpP6xrVXc2hDLLJkObemSWp8GhQjo", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}

Quite often it proceeds in the following order:\n\n1.  Look for a potentially publishable direction in the field.\n2.  Focus on publishing a result, declaring success upon deriving the result and getting acceptance, and\n3.  Lastly, look for a real-world application as an added bonus. For example, chat with engineers and try to convince them that the published result is so great that they should use it.\n\nAt Aptos Labs, we flip this script. Here:\n\n1.  We first identify hard problems that block us from achieving the performance, security and usability in the Aptos blockchain and its surrounding ecosystem.\n2.  We then focus on solving these problems, tracking our effort all along to drive significant production impact, and\n3.  Publish and celebrate the achieved results at top-tier venues.\n\nWe believe in this approach because the current landscape in the field of blockchain & Web 3.0 is full of significant problems, still open and unresolved, standing in the way of widespread adoption for billions of people across a broad set of use cases. More importantly, these problems span disciplines such as cryptography, distributed systems, programming languages, game theory, databases, networking and concurrency. To investigate and prioritize these problems, we rely on our close connection with our world-class engineering team and their intimate knowledge of the needs of the Aptos blockchain. Hence, we are in a unique and privileged position where solutions to most of the hard problems that we face are most likely going to be novel and publishable.\n\nWe understand that the research process can be [unpredictable and non-linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1U26PLiXjM). We may not solve every problem under all its constraints. Still, we search for solutions that do not fall apart when faced with the hard reality of a practical deployment. Our approach is to [“find a way, or make one”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inveniam_viam). We do not get stuck with extremes, such as stronger, unsolvable variants of the problem or oversimplified solutions that only work in convoluted academic settings.\n\n## Make publication worthy again\n\nWe aspire to advance the state of the art in blockchain technology. We welcome collaboration with others across the industry and academia who share the same goals. We dedicate significant effort to explain our results and share our knowledge via less technical and more educational mediums such as blog posts, talks and seminars.\n\nWe strive to publish results that we are proud of at the best possible venues. We never publish for the sake of publishing nor do we optimize artificial metrics.\n\nWe hold ourselves to the highest standards, requiring rigorous proofs of correctness for our protocols, and comprehensive experiments designed to leave no doubt in any of our claims. We utilize the academic review process as a tool to help us achieve this objective.\n\nIf we think our result is being unfairly judged, we start by first taking a hard look at ourselves, by asking hard questions and soliciting brutally-honest feedback from academics and other experts. We will not be blinded by appeasing the fragile ego of [reviewer #2](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1803) (e.g., *No, we will not reproduce our system and experiments on HyperLedger Fabric..*) nor ever develop an unhealthy fixation towards a particular venue or perceived academic prestige.\n\nIn other words, if the academic review process for a top-venue acceptance becomes too political or adversarial, we conclude that the overhead might not always be worth it. Instead, we let the ultimate judge of our contributions and impact be the time itself and the objectively-measurable metrics at the massive scale of the Aptos blockchain.\n\n## Make debate open again\n\nWe believe that open and direct discussions, even passionate debates at times, are the most healthy, efficient way for making progress. Crucial to this are mutual respect and mutual agreement:\n\n1.  To criticize the ideas and never the people, and\n2.  Trust that others are following (1).\n\nWe believe that by doing so, the best ideas will emerge and the best technology will make its way to the Aptos blockchain.\n\n## Make research deploy again\n\nWe consider advancing the frontier of our knowledge as a success metric for any research project. Therefore, we are not discouraged when an approach does not lead to real-world impact. However, when an approach does pull through, we take responsibility for seeing it implemented in production.\n\nIn other words, Aptos researchers lean into engineering: coding is not beneath them, but quite the opposite.\n\n[Research scientists](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/jobs/4005572005) at Aptos Labs combine foundational knowledge of the respective fields with the ability to speak the same language as the engineers, willingness to learn and grow, and follow the desire to deliver the projects to completion, possibly landing and owning the code in production.\n\n[Research engineers](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/jobs/4015672005) are instrumental to this process. Research engineers provide the creativity and the engineering pedigree to transform novel, unconventional, and research-originated approaches into the high-performance, high-quality robust system components for the real-world deployment.\n", "timestamp": 1654769921, "digest": "ejE6r05lXqp1qgogs7ZHYFAV7i4uknnRQexv4yrw9Ig", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}

[@Zoezoe888zoe](https://twitter.com/Zoezoe888zoe) [@WhoKnowsDAO](https://twitter.com/WhoKnowsDAO)\n\n本期文字稿精选了6个 Space 中的精彩提问。\n\n编辑：三斤妹妹、定慧\n\n## 什么是 Social Fi ？为什么要 Fi 化那些资产？是否是伪命题？\n\n**pengsong：**\n\nSocial fi 与 Web2 最大的不同是：\n\n能够定义你社交关系的价值，并将其资产化、金融化。\n\n并且对个人（地址）进行赋能。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n**socailfi= social+fi**，是由 defi 到 gamefi 再到 socialfi 逐步演进的。**social 所涉及的人的广泛程度是最大的。**\n\n我认为 socailfi 的本质是通过 web3 的理念改变以往社交产品中的价值分配，让 web2 里别扭的地方通过激励系统的重新调配，去高效地完成供给层和需求平台在 social 层面上的交易撮合。\n\n但我觉得 social fi 是不是伪命题还需要靠验证。\n\nsocialfi 是目前所有“xfi”中唯一没有杀手级应用的词。从17、18年的尝试至今都没有跑出来一个真正有PMF的产品，因此我认为它是一个待被定义的词，如果长时间不被定义，这个词就会慢慢死掉，换做其他。当然这个问题背后的根本还是 web3 是不是完全的fi。\n\n**林川：**\n\n**social fi 更合适的称呼应该为“web3社交平台”**，虽然目前没有一个确切的定义，但我可以讲讲它不是什么。\n\n首先 social fi 不是 web2 社交产品的简单复刻；其次也不是 social to earn。\n\nsocial to earn的 主要问题在于奖惩激励很难明确化，很难防止用户互刷，产品本身的定位也会模糊掉。\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\nSocialfi 的核心是fi，token 和 NFT 所提供的金融和资产的工具让 web3 的社交产品对于价值分配和冷启动方面有更多可用的东西，至于重构好的产品是什么样的，目前还看不清楚。\n\n一直拘泥于 x to earn 的模式里很难逃脱旁氏的魔咒。因为金融化未必能给到用户最想要的东西，用户追求的主要功能还是交友、date、沟通与链接，金钱的过分加持会让人贪婪，不管是对单纯的用户也好还是在app里以挣钱为目的的一部分人。\n\n## Web2 领域有哪些可以借鉴的地方？\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n首先需要去理清产品的定位，即“社交”指的是什么？\n\n社交本身是一个被宽泛使用的概念，实际上在产品定位的坐标轴上是有不同程度和不同定位的，按照关系链强弱和内容占比，可以分为：\n\n**1.通信通讯类**\n\n**2.交友匹配类** (dating app / social network）\n\n**3.UGC社区类产品**\n\n**4.社交媒体**\n\n四种的产品的形态、设计重点、交付给用户的核心价值不同。\n\nSocialfi 中 fi 的概念可能是指：\n\n我们如何通过 token 的模型&方式，去重新做社交中的用户激励与利益分配？\n\n利益分配不止赚钱，例如 Dating APP 的匹配。\n\n至于 socialfi 里面的去中心化比重有多少，我认为可能没有办法做到全部环节的去中心化。\n\n比如说账号的新旧数据是用户自有的，无论是自己发的 UGC 内容还是新产生的社交图谱、关系链中的数据用户都可以自由处理与转移，这是去中心化的体现。但是最后很多环节可能避免不了要中心化，比如对于传统社交媒体和社交软件来说，它的一些核心能力与价值是掌握在平台当中的。\n\n比如对于dating app 来说核心是匹配算法，用户之间的匹配很难做到去中心化，因为会导致社交效率极低下。所以社交追求的是两件事，一个是找到的用户质量足够高，另一个是匹配精准用户的效率足够高。\n\n结合上面两点来看，我认为web3如果要将 social 和 fi 结合好，**用户质量、用户获得感、用户参与感、用户对资产的拥有和处理，**这些更偏质量的东西可能是优化的重点，而一些本身特别追求用户连接效率的社交模式不太适合做区块链的改造。\n\n## 目前对Web2社交产品的批评集中在哪些方面？Web3用户期待什么样的新社交产品？\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n如果是复刻 Web2 的产品。本身没有太大意义，因为对于用户来说除了有 token 可以挣以外并没有特别的价值。\n\n**而 token 本身的金融属性提供了很好的项目初期冷启动工具**，对前期圈一波用户有很大的帮助。比如说 Open DAO 和礼物空投 group，很可惜这两个项目后面没有能让用户留下来的产品。\n\n我体验过很多复刻，但是效果都不好。\n\n我认为从产品开发的角度讲应当跳开已有概念框架的约束去思考目前web3用户群体最大的痛点是什么，再根据痛点去找合适的产品方向。至少我发现很多人体感 discord 难用，以及安全事件屡屡发生，是否可以开发出一款专门针对 web3 用户的类 discord 通讯工具去解决用户最大的痛点与需求？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前对 web2 社交产品的批评更多集中在中心化和数据资产的所有权上，在国内这个问题不是用户直接体验到的。\n\n对于 web3 产品的新需求大家集中在社群的交流和管理的需求层面，因为目前还是用 web2 的产品discord 和 telegram 来代替的，它们毕竟不是原生的 web3 产品，各自都有一些问题。因此新的 web3产品需要瞄准用户的新需求与痛点，我赞同麻辣烫老师的观点去做 discord 的替代品，是具有一定的前景的。\n\n**陈不斯：**\n\n1\\.针对麻辣烫老师提出的痛点问题，人是否真的需要单独的社交产品？\n\nNot Boring 认为NFT是一种新型社交网络，因此是否需要一个单独平台去服务和承载是一个值得探索的思考的问题。\n\n2\\.如果社交产品是成立的，同时web3的金融属性不可避免，是否可以考虑本身就有一些经济属性或者逐利属性的社交行为？参考web2产品里的社交行为去用token经济模型改造。\n\n3\\.如果web3的金融属性可以被抛弃，发展到了用户足够大、圈层足够广泛和多样的时候，是否会跟web2产品遵循同样的方法论？“为工具而来，为网络而留”\n\nweb3相比web2来说最大的优势是互通性，代表用户的安全、隐私问题，给予用户足够的自主权，但是整体上面临的最大问题还是没有找到核心痛点让用户有动力从web2社交产品迁移到web3中去。\n\n**wegger：**\n\n很多赛道都在做socialfi的产品，发现了有以下特点：\n\n1\\.有门槛，通过爱好或者资产进行过滤。人们会偏好于小众社交，对身份的认同感在小圈子里支撑起来。\n\n2\\.socialfi在隐私领域的运营场景。\n\n3\\.技术差距不大，更倾向于思维和圈子层次的小众化，往小而精的方向发展。\n\n**taosha：**\n\nMake sense的场景：用户的数据算有权。不用证明自己做了什么事情，直接在链上数据可以看到相关资质。\n\n在招聘场景里，文凭可以作为一个 soulbound token（灵魂绑定代币），并绑定在一个作为 soul 的 did 上，不管是做 web3 领英或相亲平台，都可以从 did 的 soulbound token 中读取到我对文凭获得证明。\n\n对于项目来说，web3最大的红利是拉新获客很简单。过去我们需要在抖音、百度上买广告，而现在可以去扫描谁持有 BAYC (无聊猿)，就知道他很有钱，可以给他的地址空投一个 NFT 推销产品。\n\n在链上target用户较为精准和方便，更好地服务用户。\n\n**zoey：**\n\n思考两个问题：为了什么要做？为了谁去做？\n\nweb3 的价值定义：\n\n**1.让价值回归个体**\n\n**2.增强每个个体之间的情感链接**\n\n**3.不被平台控制的个人身份**\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n## 协议 vs 应用，对两个不同方向有什么看法？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前发展形态上是产品和协议之争。\n\n如果短期出现一个比较火的 web3 的社交产品做出圈的话，需要非常强的运营能力，单纯靠协议很难。长期看web3本身的基建更适合做重协议、轻应用的形态。\n\n大家更愿意接受社交关系和身份绑定，应用只调用社交关系，而不是到哪个产品都要再跑一遍社交关系。\n\n我长期更看好协议的发展，短期能出圈的可能还是重产品、重运营的一些社交应用。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n协议需要有用户共识，而 Social 更是直接对接终端用户\n\nSocial layer 的协议，应基于杀手级应用而诞生。\n\n因为协议是制定被大家所使用的规则，杀手级应用能为规则带来共识。\n\n特别是【社交图谱】，用户必须知道这个网友我是怎么认识的，就非常看重应用场景。所以如果要做社交图谱的协议，一定要从自带场景的 APP 起步。\n\n像 super connect 这样的项目没有这么做，我不是很能理解。\n\n**林川：**\n\nsuper connect 如果要出圈，应该会是各种想做社交的应用发现调用 super connect 这个协议会很方便，能给自己加一层社交关系，从而逐渐产生跟风效应火起来。\n\n**pengsong：**\n\n如何将 social 的记录从应用的中心化存储状态放上链，NFT可能是一个很好的选择。通过钱包地址中记录着社交关系的NFT 配合协议实现社交关系上链。\n\n但目前这个领域大家围绕 social 更多是 token 的这种经济设计，NFT 的底子比较薄弱，可能还需要半年一年的时间发展。\n\n思想转变：\n\n❌ Token 经济模型\n\n❌ 中心化数据库\n\n✅ NFT 关系网络\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n站在产业格局的角度，虽然区块链是“胖协议，瘦应用”\n\n但当A16z 对 web3 概念的炒作，其实这个概念背后蕴含着将 Web3 推广给更多用户的期待。\n\n更多的应用场景带来的不仅是对整个行业发展的促进，也意味着行业上下游的竞争。例如协议下场做应用，或应用上升做协议。\n\n因此未来可能是 **“胖协议，胖应用”** 的状态。\n\nSocial 协议提供的核心价值是什么？\n\n* 如果是数据（关系链、用户身份等），则会受应用层牵制，需要等待应用的发展与积累。难以像其它协议一样通过开发者快速迭代升级\n* 如果是技术，目前社交产品的开发门槛比较低，更看重运营，协议可能无法提供足够的价值。\n\n提升价值的建议：【数据】+【技术创新】+【增值服务】\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n## 如果是杀手级应用来开发协议的话，这个应用是否可能是由 Web2 的老家伙搞出来的？\n\n或者干脆是把 Web2 产品改造而来，例如马斯克改造推特的可能？\n\n如果说，推特能被马斯克私有化，不再服务于股东利益，通过把底层协议和用户关系贡献出来，将自己的平台价值颠覆掉，转型成一个社交公链，想象空间就太大了。\n\n而且对于web2巨头自我革命，恐怕只有马斯克有机会做到了\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\n反对，推特这样的巨鳄自我革命太难。\n\n更可能的路径是这样的：\n\n目前围绕各个公链，已经基于交易，形成了经济关系网络，而社区中空。\n\n（例如以太坊网络中60-70%的地址都在 Defi 热潮中参与了进来。但没有产品去承载这种社交关系）\n\n因此，围绕公链做社区才是方向。因为只要公链不死，关系网络就在。\n\n这是我看好的 Social fi 机会。\n\n**Eric：**\n\n看好 Web2 巨头带着自身存量转入 Web3\n\n因为网络效应太重，哪怕开发者达成共识追求理想，但难以与用户达成共识。\n\n可能只有用户的无感知迁移才行得通。\n\n**BillyWen：**\n\n曾经电报、电话时代，协议都是通的。例如你可以随时给美国朋友打电话。\n\nIM 即时通讯时代来临后，才出现应用层建墙圈用户，为了自身获利。\n\n目前 Web3 实现了货币和金融的无边界，相信未来的 web3 Social 一样没有边界。\n\n商业公司改革的确很困难，因为要追求利润。\n\n但未来10年如果有人站出来，做出了打破边界的 Social 变革，我相信他会被载入史册。\n\n**Beagle Dao：**\nWeb3 Social 有四个方面\n\n1. **基础设施、协议**\n   1. 例如 ENS 解决了钱包和名字的问题，通过 ENS 的身份社交，而非钱包地址。\n2. **社交凭证**\n   1. 例如 POAP，通过 NFT 证明你在哪里做过什么事\n3. **社交关系、社交图谱**\n4. **工具**\n   1. 【语音】例如：Clubhouse 、Twitter space\n   2. 【信息】例如：微信、邮件\n   3. 【内容】例如：推特、FB\n\n语音比较难做。\n\n信息类工具很多人在做，迁移成本高，平台不互动。\n\n可能需要大佬入场，强制或用更高的势能带动更多人加入\n\n因为 Web3 的社交关系都存在链上，所以不会像 Web2 那样重平台。\n\n更可能是共创式，每个人都做一点，拼成整个 Web3 社交的生态。\n\n观点：**Web3 社交会从B端生长出来。**\n\n对于C端而言，Web2 已经有足够好的产品了。\n\n更大的可能性是开发B端有普遍需求的工具&协议，因为B端自己懒的做而被广泛调用，因而普及。\n\n## Web2 是邪恶的吗？\n\n**Eric：**\n\n我并不认为web2 邪恶，至少有游戏规则\n\nweb2 榨取用户价值、用户体验受损的的矛盾会持续存在，但也与现在的资本市场玩法息息相关。例如开放平台都会缩回去，因为平台感觉自己把有价值的东西送出去，但却无法满足金主爸爸的期待。\n\n这种恶是人性的恶。只要 Web3 是人做的，我想一样会面对。\n\n**web3 的核心是改变价值体系，基于token 经济让系统中的各个角色都开心。**\n\n但从金融层面，怎么玩都是零和游戏。打破很难。\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n区块链不能解决人性的问题，从终局来看我会悲观，未来可能会出来新的不正义和垄断。\n\n而此刻他正在追求更公平，找到新的解决方案，这是我欣赏的。\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\nWeb3 的社交可能会更邪恶。\n\n当一个人的身份可以被 NFT 等链上方式充分定义，很多社交圈层将很容易通过技术建立门槛。你可能无法再通过找关系就加入一个大佬们会讨论问题的微信群、获得资源。可能因为你没进圈子，连吃瓜的资格都没有。\n\n但相应的，web2 当中很难走上颠覆（头部效应），在web3当中，你的努力更容易实现成功。\n\n**Red_Phoenix:**\n\n任何一个行业都有其宿命，都有其黑暗和光明。\n\n例如 Web2 的公司就一定会走向垄断和盈利，**而 Social 在 Web3 中的使命，可能是构建一个国家**，有自己共识、金融和分配方式。特别是当区块链的信用、生产力与线下产生链接时，就非常有想象力。\n\n——————————————\n\nWhoKnows DAO 将持续为大家组织优质的 Space、专题研究活动。\n\n如果你希望基于 Social fi

{"id": "XUFG5BsPqU__4B2GuDq_sQzXRav79QT7k4wvtQ-KrL4", "title": "The Evolution of State Sync: The path to 100k+ transactions per second with sub-second latency at Aptos", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*pq1hY3A_P-ao8UB26hcLSw.png)\n\n**By **[**Joshua Lind**](https://www.joshdavidlind.com/)\n\n**TL;DR: The Aptos blockchain leverages a wide range of novel techniques to ensure high-throughput, low latency, verified state synchronization in a decentralized network. Peers can validate and synchronize over 10k transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second latency in Aptos today, and we’re already on our way to 100k+ TPS.**\n\n## Overview\n\nState synchronization (or state sync) is an important but often overlooked aspect of blockchain design. In this blogpost, we discuss the evolution of state sync at Aptos and present several key insights behind the design of the latest state sync protocol. We further explore how we recently increased state sync throughput by 10x, reduced latency by 3x, and are continuing to pave the way for faster, more efficient blockchain synchronization.\n\n## What is state sync?\n\nMost blockchains today are structured hierarchically, with a set of active validators at the heart of the network. The validators grow the blockchain by executing transactions, producing blocks and achieving consensus. The rest of the peers in the network (e.g., fullnodes and clients) replicate the blockchain data produced by the validators (e.g., blocks and transactions). State sync is the protocol that allows non-validator peers to distribute, verify and persist this blockchain data and ensures that all peers in the ecosystem are synchronized. See the diagram below for what this looks like at Aptos.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XesMBhS5rLVIiluTme0nlw.png)\n\nAptos Ecosystem (Overview)\n\n## Why does state sync matter?\n\nState sync is rarely mentioned when evaluating blockchains: it is often a footnote in a whitepaper dedicated to more interesting topics\\*. However, state sync has significant consequences on blockchain performance, security, and user experience. Consider the following:\n\n1.  **Time to finality and user experience:** When new transactions are executed by validators, state sync is responsible for propagating the data to peers and clients. If state sync is slow or unreliable, peers will perceive long transaction processing delays, artificially inflating the time to finality. This has a huge impact on user experience, e.g., decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and payment processing will all be much slower.\n2.  **Relationship with consensus:** Validators that crash or fall behind the rest of the validator set rely on state sync to bring them back up to speed (i.e., synchronize the latest blockchain state). If state sync cannot process transactions as quickly as they are executed by consensus, crashed validators will never be able to recover. Moreover, new validators will never be able to start participating in consensus (as they won’t ever catch up!) and fullnodes will never be able to sync to the latest state (they’ll continue to fall further behind!).\n3.  **Implications on decentralization**: Having a quick, efficient and scalable state sync protocol allows for: (i) faster rotations of an active validator set, as validators can move in and out of consensus more freely; (ii) more potential validators to choose from in the network; (iii) more fullnodes to come online quickly and without having to wait long periods of time; and (iv) lower resource requirements, increasing heterogeneity. All of these factors increase decentralization in the network and help to scale the blockchain in size and geography.\n4.  **Data correctness**: State sync is responsible for verifying the correctness of all blockchain data during synchronization. This prevents malicious peers and adversaries in the network from modifying, censoring or fabricating transaction data and presenting it as valid. If state sync fails to do this (or does it incorrectly), fullnodes and clients could be tricked into accepting invalid data and this would have devastating consequences on the network.\n\n## Reasoning about state sync\n\nTo better reason about state sync, we first introduce a generic model for blockchain execution. While this model targets the Aptos blockchain specifically, it can be generalized to others.\n\nWe model the Aptos blockchain as a simple versioned database, where at each version **V** there is a unique blockchain state **Sⱽ** containing all on-chain accounts and resources. A transaction **T** can be executed by the Aptos virtual machine (VM) on state **Sⱽ** to produce a state delta **Dᵀᵥ **representing all state modifications that would occur on **Sⱽ **should **T **be committed. When **Dᵀᵥ** is applied to **Sⱽ** (that is, we consider **T** committed), it results in a new version **V+1** and a new blockchain state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We refer to the very first blockchain state as the genesis state **S⁰**. The diagrams below show transaction execution and state delta application.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZwNwY2c1kg8mYrQ-pmHziA.png)\n\nTransaction Execution and State Delta Application (Model)\n\n## What are the goals?\n\nWith a generic model in place, we can now define several fundamental goals for state sync\\*\\*:\n\n1.  **High-throughput**: State sync should maximize the amount of transactions that can be synchronized by each peer per second. That is, maximize the rate of state transitions from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹** for each **T **committed by the validators. If throughput is low it increases syncing time and becomes a bottleneck for the network.\n2.  **Low latency**: State sync should minimize the time it takes up-to-date peers to synchronize new transactions committed by validators. That is, minimize the time it takes peers at **Sⱽ** to sync to **Sⱽ⁺¹**, for each **T** that is newly committed by the validators. This affects the overall time to finality perceived by clients.\n3.  **Fast bootstrapping time**: State sync should minimize the time it takes new (or crashed) peers to sync to the latest state of the blockchain. That is, minimize the time it takes to sync to **Sⱽ **(where **V** is the highest database version agreed by the validators) regardless of the peer’s current version **P** and state **Sᴾ**. This allows peers to perform useful work more quickly (e.g., respond to balance queries or validate transactions).\n4.  **Resistance to failures and malicious actors:** State sync should be resistant to failures (e.g., machine and network failures) and tolerate malicious actors in the network, including other peers. This means overcoming a wide-variety of attacks, e.g., fabricated transaction data, modified or replayed network messages, and [eclipse attacks](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin).\n5.  **Tolerant of resource constraints and heterogeneity:** State sync should tolerate resource constraints (e.g., CPU, memory and storage) and embrace heterogeneity. Given the nature of decentralized networks, peers will have access to different types of hardware and optimize for different goals. State sync should account for this.\n\n## The required building blocks\n\nWe next introduce a set of fundamental building blocks required to construct a state sync protocol. For the sake of brevity, we provide a summary of each building block below and defer the technical details to future work (each of these could be a blogpost, itself!):\n\n1.  **Persistent storage:** To persist data across machine crashes and failures (and enable data distribution to other peers!) we require that each peer has access to trusted persistent storage. At Aptos, we’re currently using [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) but are actively exploring other options.\n2.  **Verifiable blockchain data:** To prevent malicious actors from modifying blockchain data, we require data to be authenticated and verifiable. Specifically, we need to be able to prove: (i) every transaction **T** that has been executed and committed by validators; (ii) the order of every transaction **T** executed and committed by validators; and (iii) the resulting blockchain states **Sⱽ** after committing each transaction **T**. At Aptos, we achieve this by: (i) building [merkle trees](https://aptos.dev/basics/basics-merkle-proof/) over committed transactions and the resulting blockchain states; and (ii) having validators sign the merkle roots of these trees to authenticate them.\n3.  **A root of trust:** Given that Aptos supports dynamic validator sets (i.e., changes to validators at each epoch), peers need to be able to identify the current validator set from a verified history of the Aptos blockchain. We achieve this through: (i) a **genesis blob** authenticated by Aptos, which identifies the first validator set and initial blockchain state **S⁰**; and (ii) a **recent** **trusted waypoint** (e.g., a hash of the current validator set and blockchain state **Sⱽ**). Together, the genesis blob and waypoint form a root of trust allowing peers to synchronize the real Aptos blockchain and prevent attacks (e.g., [long-range attacks](https://dlt-repo.net/long-range-attack-in-proof-of-stake-pos-blockchains/)).\n\n## Achieving 1k TPS: A naive approach\n\nUsing the model and building blocks presented above, we can now illustrate a naive state sync protocol. This protocol is a simplification of the original protocol used by Aptos (i.e., `state sync v1`).\n\nThe protocol works as follows: (i) `Alice` (the syncing peer) identifies the highest local persisted blockchain version **V** and state **Sⱽ**. If none exists, `Alice` uses genesis, i.e., **S⁰**; (ii) `Alice` then randomly selects a peer, `Bob`, and requests any new sequential transactions that have been committed by the validators; (iii) if `Alice` receives a response from `Bob`, `Alice` will verify the new transactions (**T⁰ **to **Tᴺ**) and execute them to produce state delta’s (**D⁰ᵥ** to **Dᵀᵥ**₊ₙ); (iv) `Alice` will then apply the new state delta’s to storage along with the new transactions, updating the local state of the blockchain from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹⁺ᴺ**. `Alice` repeats this loop indefinitely. Pseudocode for the protocol looks as follows:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BNHW7j2GMZYb9pGe1lFvgw.png)\n\nState Sync v1 (Pseudocode)\n\nWe implemented this protocol at Aptos, benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), and analyzed it. Some of the key observations we made were:\n\n1.  **Throughput is network latency bound**: This protocol achieves a maximum of `~1.2k TPS`. However, throughput is heavily affected by network latencies as `Alice` requests data sequentially and must wait for the peer to respond. Given that we’re seeing an average network round trip time (RTT) of `150ms` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), this is suboptimal.\n2.  **CPU is dominated by execution**: When `Alice` receives a new set of transactions to synchronize, we see that `55%` of the CPU time is spent executing the transactions and `40%` is spent verifying the data, applying the state deltas to storage and persisting the new transactions. The other `5%` is attributed to message handling, serialization and other tasks.\n3.  **Latency is high**: When running the network at maximum load, the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~900 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is primarily due to `Alice` randomly selecting peers when requesting data and not taking into account the network topology: peers that are closer to the validators will receive new transactions sooner.\n4.  **Bootstrapping is slow**: The protocol above requires `Alice` to replay and synchronize all transactions since genesis. If `Alice` is far behind the latest state, she must wait a long period of time before being able to do anything useful (this might take hours or even days!).\n5.  **Performance is easily manipulated**: The performance of this protocol is heavily influenced by malicious peers. As identified in 1 above, intentionally slow (or non-responsive) peers will force `Alice` to spend long periods of time waiting for data and not doing anything. Thus, significantly increasing synchronization time.\n6.  **Resource usage is high**: This protocol is expensive for all resource types: (i) CPU usage is high because `Alice` must re-execute all transactions; (ii) storage is high because `Alice` must store all transactions and blockchain states since genesis; and (iii) network usage is high because `Alice` must receive all transactions since genesis via the network. This automatically imposes high costs and resource requirements, reducing heterogeneity.\n7.  **Resources are wasted**: While `Alice` is synchronizing new data, peers in the network are also synchronizing from her. As the number of peers requesting data from `Alice` grows, there is an additional read load placed onto storage and CPU required to handle these requests. However, much of the computation that `Alice` performs to handle these requests is wasteful as peers are often requesting the same data.\n\n## Achieving 10k TPS: An optimized approach\n\nLooking at the naive protocol above, we can make a number of modifications to help address the limitations. First, we extend the protocol to support 2 additional modes of synchronization:\n\n1.  **State delta syncing**: Given that validators already execute transactions and attest to the resulting blockchain states through merkle proofs, peers can rely on the state deltas produced by the validators to skip transaction execution. This avoids: (i) the high cost of execution, reducing CPU time by about `55%`; and (ii) the need for an Aptos VM, greatly simplifying a delta syncing implementation. As a result, peers can now synchronize by downloading each transaction **T** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** and applying them to storage to produce the new state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We note that this comes at the cost of increased network usage (by approx. `2.5x`).\n2.  **Blockchain snapshot syncing**: Given that validators attest to each blockchain state **Sⱽ**, we can further reduce bootstrapping time by allowing peers to download the latest blockchain state directly (instead of having to produce it using transactions or state deltas). This significantly reduces bootstrapping time and is a similar approach to [snap-sync](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/) in Ethereum. The trade-off is that peers will not store any transactions or blockchain states prior to **Sⱽ**.\n\nNext, we implement a number of general optimizations and additional features to help improve performance and scalability:\n\n1.  **Data prefetching**: To prevent network latencies from impacting throughput, we can perform data prefetching. Peers can prefetch transaction data (e.g., transactions and state deltas) from other peers before processing them, amortizing network latencies.\n2.  **Pipelined execution and storage**: To further increase syncing throughput, we can separate transaction execution from storage persistence and use pipelining: a commonly used [optimization in processor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-and-architecture-pipelining-set-1-execution-stages-and-throughput/) design. This allows a transaction **T²** to be executed while a transaction **T¹** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** are concurrently persisted to storage.\n3.  **Peer monitoring and reputation:** To improve observability and better tolerate malicious peers, we can implement a peer monitoring service to: (i) monitor peers for malicious behaviors (e.g., transferring invalid data); (ii) identify metadata about each peer, such as a summary of all transaction data the peer has and their perceived distance from the validator set; and (iii) maintain a local score for each peer. This information can then be used to optimize peer selection when requesting new blockchain data.\n4.  **Data caching**: To reduce the read load on storage and prevent state sync from performing redundant computations as more and more peers synchronize, we can implement a data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory.\n5.  **Storage pruning:** To prevent storage from continuously growing over time (e.g., as more transactions are committed), we can also implement dynamic pruners to remove unnecessary transaction and blockchain data from storage, e.g., anything older than a few days, weeks or months, depending on the peer configuration.\n\nWe implemented these modifications and produced a new state sync protocol (i.e., `state sync v2`). We benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) and observed:\n\n1.  **Throughput increased by 5x-10x**: When executing transactions, the protocol now achieves a maximum of `~4.5k TPS`, primarily as a result of pipelining and data prefetching (i.e., the protocol is now able to fully saturate the CPU). When synchronizing state deltas the protocol achieves well over `10K TPS`, a further result of avoiding transaction execution. In both cases, throughput is no longer affected by network latency.\n2.  **Latency was reduced by 3x**: While running the network at maximum load, we now see that the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~300 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is due to data prefetching and more efficient peer selection: peers who are more responsive and closer to the validators are contacted more frequently.\n3.  **Bootstrapping is significantly faster**: Peers who use blockchain snapshot syncing are able to bootstrap much more quickly. Moreover, bootstrapping time is no longer affected by the length of the blockchain (i.e., the number of transactions), but rather the number of on-chain resources to synchronize. Currently in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), peers can bootstrap within minutes\\*\\*\\*.\n4.  **Resource requirements are reduced**: With multiple synchronization modes and storage pruning, resource requirements have been reduced. Moreover, there is now support for heterogeneity as peers have flexibility to select the syncing strategy. For example: (i) peers with limited CPU can skip transaction execution; (ii) peers with limited storage can configure the pruner to be aggressive; and (iii) peers that wish to get up-to-date quickly can perform blockchain snapshot syncing.\n5.  **Resources are more efficiently used**: When handling syncing requests from peers, we see a significantly reduced read load on storage and less wasted CPU. This is due to the new data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory. We also see that as the number of syncing peers grows in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), the data cache becomes more efficient, e.g., with `20` syncing peers we see a cache hit rate of `70%-80%` per request. But, with `60` peers we see a cache hit rate of `93%-98%`. This comes at the cost of an additional `~150 MB` of RAM to maintain the cache.\n\n## 100k TPS and beyond?\n\nWhile we’ve already improved throughput by 10x and latency by 3x, we realize that there is still more to be done. Especially if we want to match [Block-STM](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/block-stm-how-we-execute-over-160k-transactions-per-second-on-the-aptos-blockchain-3b003657e4ba) and make *Aptos a Layer 1 for everyone*!\n\nSo, how are we going to get there? Well, we’ve already started on our next state sync goal: 100k+ TPS! Although, we’re planning to save the details for a future blogpost we did want to provide some hints to the very keen reader:\n\n1.  **Transaction** **batching**: Currently, Aptos treats every transaction as verifiable, i.e., the merkle proofs used to authenticate and verify data operate at the transaction granularity. This makes verification and storage incredibly expensive. One way to avoid this is to perform transaction batching, i.e., proofs over batches (or blocks!) of transactions.\n2.  **Network compression**: Network bandwidth often becomes a bottleneck in peer-to-peer networks and Aptos is no exception. Currently, the state sync prefetcher can fetch around `~45K TPS` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) before saturating bandwidth. This is an issue if we want to scale. Thankfully, we’ve already recognized that peers are distributing data using an inefficient serialization format and by using off the shelf compression we can reduce the amount of transmitted data by more than `10x`.\n3.  **Faster storage writes:** Currently, state sync throughput is bottlenecked by the time it takes to persist blockchain data to storage. We’re actively looking at different optimizations and improvements that we can make to remove this bottleneck, including: (i) more efficient data structures; (ii) more optimal storage configurations; and (iii) alternate storage engines.\n4.  **Parallel data processing**: Until now, we’ve required that state sync process data sequentially (e.g., handle transactions at sequentially increasing versions). However, there are a number of existing approaches that would allow us to avoid this requirement and exploit parallel data processing to significantly increase throughput, e.g., blockchain sharding!\n\nUntil next time!\n\n*If you are, like us, passionate about designing algorithms, putting them in practice, and making a real impact on the future of Web3, please reach out — we are *[*hiring*](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/)* at Aptos.*\n\n\\*Like consensus :)\\\n\\*\\*We implicitly assume that state sync must synchronize the states of **all on-chain resources**. Partial syncing strategies (e.g., light-clients that target specific accounts) are out of scope and will be discussed in the future.\\\n\\*\\*\\*This metric should be taken with a heap of salt. The Aptos [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) is wiped bi-weekly, so there is limited state to synchronize. More evaluation will be required on longer running networks (e.g., our incentivized [testnets](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-roadmap-209be695c77c)).\n", "timestamp": 1654770163, "digest": "YYj5glsQpEn8CC5FmmnrxK_OG1QFHoQNcRs6YQSQTeY", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}

During this journey, we look forward to the Aptos community coming together to build a secure, reliable, and decentralized network. Below we describe our timeline along this path, outlining both deliverables and goals. The exact goals and rewards will be published as the registration for the incentivized testnet opens. While this document aims to be exhaustive in the work remaining, we intend to maintain flexibility in the timeline due to new opportunities and challenges that are found along the way.\n\nThe primary goal for our incentivized testnets is simple: ensure that this community is ready to launch a production-grade Aptos mainnet. Node operators, developers, auditors, and ecosystem builders alike are all invited to participate and will be rewarded for their contributions toward this goal. Our community will engage in a number of evaluations and drills that validate the outcomes of core developer testing and also prepare us all for mainnet operation. We invite and welcome all feedback across the Aptos community during this exciting time and will host frequent community sessions to listen, iterate, and improve on these plans.\n\n## Overview\n\n**IT1 (Incentivized Testnet 1): Decentralized Startup**\n\n*   Registration May 13\n*   Begins May 16\n*   Completes May 27\n*   Major Deliverables\\\n    1\\.

Our community of intrepid Aptonauts will coordinate missions to explore the Aptoverse. This way, everyone has opportunities to get involved and earn rewards from quality participation. We are openly discussing a few incentivized projects:\n\n1.  Aptoversity (education)\n2.  Bounties + Hackathons (development)\n3.  Creative Challenge (growth)\n\nWe will share more info about how to participate in this Aptos community program soon. Jump in [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aptoslabs) to discuss, and keep an eye out for the new Aptos community forum.\n\n## FAQ\n\nWhat behaviors will be rewarded?\n\n*   For every deliverable and goal, Aptos Labs with support from the Aptos community will determine the proper success criteria and incentives to understand our progress in the area. Some evaluations may have to be repeated, possibly with improved success criteria and with different incentives. We will provide a clear determination of both the success criteria and incentives prior to starting every evaluation with the community.\n\nWhat will the registration process look like?\n\n*   We are still working through the requirements to join incentivized testnet and what the registration process will include.\n\nWhen will there be more updates?\n\n*   We will share more details as we get closer to the launch of incentivized testnet. Many of these areas of ambiguity are noted in our roadmap outlined below.\n\nWhen will you publish your tokenomics and white paper?\n\n*   We are actively evaluating different approaches to tokenomics and anticipate some form being published while we are running the incentivized testnets. Similarly, our white paper will encompass the work we believe will be ready by Mainnet, which will also be forthcoming.\n\nCould you elaborate on the validator participation size?\n\n*   During IT1, we’ll start with 100 participants. We set this number cautiously as this is the first time the software stack will be run in the wild. Internally, we have evaluated much larger networks. We anticipate increasing the number of participants in each ensuing round as the community establishes an understanding of deploying and managing an Aptos node. By IT4, we anticipate allowing as many validators as possible.\n\n## Technical Roadmap\n\nBetween now and through the end of the incentivized testnets, we will be upgrading the Aptos blockchain with many technical contributions.

{"id": "coxVUobbXvVWVw35bZMRiCbjO04I4J9TJ2g0x8C0JSQ", "title": "Proposal: develop usecases for more engagement with the community", "body": "Dear Community,\n\nSince summer 2021 I’ve been in love with the NFT space and all its developments during this time. During that time I also joined the KOIOS Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies minor (30 ECTS) and developed a proof of concept during my field assignment. KOIOS was very interested in bringing me on board so I joined their tech-team quickly after.\n\nNFTs are in my opinion and after doing some research a great way to start and keep a community engaged with the project. So in this post I’ll share my idea to bring the KOIOS platform to a new level with the involvement of NFTs.\n\n## 1. Backstory & Thesis\n\nSince early may I have been doing my thesis at KOIOS, with so far great success. I’ve received positive outlooks from my thesis examiner and mentors.\n\n### 1.1 Thesis subject\n\nMy thesis involves bringing usecases to the KOIOS platform that make use blockchain technology and the primary goal of the thesis and KOIOS is to grow more interest and involvement from the community.\n\nAs KOIOS states:\n\n> “KOIOS aims to become a worldwide **community** with a platform where talent can learn, earn and return. The focus is on the **community**.\"\n\n### 1.2 Thesis progress\n\nDuring my thesis I’ve been researching NFTs and their usecases, especially some successful NFT communities. I also analyzed their on-chain statistics using [Nansen](https://www.nansen.ai/).\n\nProjects I’ve researched:\n\n* Bored Ape Yacht Club\n* CloneX - X Takashi Murakami\n* Proof Collective / Moonbirds\n* Nanopass / Phantom Network\n\nI’ve found some interesting similarities and innovations to attain and engage a community.\n\n**“Utility is king”**\n\nUtility is a very imporant factor for an NFT to have, because people want to be able to use the NFT. Art only is not enough for a community centric NFT.  Forms of utility that successfully worked are:\n\n* IP Ownership\n* Exclusive access\n* **Gamification**\n\nSo to conclude an NFT needs utility to attain interest from the community.\n\n## 2. The proposal\n\nFor my thesis I need to gather as many input from the community, because we are not a closed group of people anymore. Your input matters here. Feel free to DM me on discord if you have any additions or ideas:\n\nPauwCrypto#9387\n\n### 2.1 The idea\n\nThe general idea is to develop an extension to the KOIOS platform that would allow new students that are going to follow the minor to claim a blank NFT in the beginning of their journey (this can later be expanded to also old students) to becoming a Titan. This blank NFT is a dynamic NFT, meaning during your journey you can **evolve** its look. How cool would that be?! See it as a sort of achievement system but in the form of NFTs.\n\n### 2.2 An example\n\nJohn Doe is a student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences and chooses to follow the 30 ECTS minor in Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies. He has 0 knowledge of blockchains.\n\nDuring the onboarding of the new students they are required to create a MetaMask wallet and register their public key with the tutors (this has been done every minor if I remember correctly).\n\nAfter wallets are submitted to the platform John is able to go to the website, connect his wallet and press a claim NFT button. This will give John a blank NFT, image can be seen below. **DON’T WORRY THIS IS NOT THE FINAL ART, JUST A QUICK SIMPLE DRAFT 😅**\n\n![EXAMPLE: This is an example of a blank NFT.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-XGmdHyvlIlFqHQA5Mpmt.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nJohn is happy with his first NFT, but wants to make it prettier. With successfully passing Level 1 of the blockchain minor john is able to claim another NFT, which is a sort of skin for his NFT (passing level 1 gives you the ability to claim a bronze skin). Using the web interface John is able to request an upgrade for his NFT. The system checks if John has the skin and updates the image for Johns’ blank NFT.\n\n![EXAMPLE: This is an example of an upgraded NFT.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n9ln-HGoUnEMjb7_1yxru.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThis was one example of an upgradable NFT, but much more could be added. For example we could have separate NFTs that can only be attained by contributing to the community or the platform, not just for passing the minor. We could attach certain statistics in terms of ‘NFT Power‘ to each trait, so the further you evolve your NFT the higher on a future leaderboard you sit.\n\nWhat I’ve explained above could be seen as gamification of the minor/platform to gain more enagement and could also lead to more contributions for the KOIOS community. This will not only help and grow the community but also teaches new students how certain things work when interacting with smart contracts and wallets through a web UI. \n\n## 3. Raw information\n\nThis section will go over some raw information regarding building this out.\n\n### 3.1 Technical details NFT\n\n* Will use ERC-721 for the blank NFT (Your blank NFT that you start with is soulbound and unique to you)\n* Will use ERC-1155 for the upgrades (for example 100 students could own the passed minor certificate NFT)\n* NFTs will be non-transferable (its an achievement for you the student only)\n\n### 3.2 Costs\n\nAn important factor of a DAO is determining costs for developement, but not only the developer also the community.\n\n* The launch of the NFTs will be on Polygon, this is an alternative evm compatible side-chain and transactions only costs cents.\n* There will be a faucet which generous community members can donate to or could be filled with some DAO funds. This allows first time blockchain users to claim their first $MATIC for transactional purposes.\n* Regarding developement costs, I’ll do this totally for free 😎, since it is for my thesis assignement (I’m studying Software Engineering).\n* I do however want to propose a reward for developing the concept.

Quite often it proceeds in the following order:\n\n1.  Look for a potentially publishable direction in the field.\n2.  Focus on publishing a result, declaring success upon deriving the result and getting acceptance, and\n3.  Lastly, look for a real-world application as an added bonus. For example, chat with engineers and try to convince them that the published result is so great that they should use it.\n\nAt Aptos Labs, we flip this script. Here:\n\n1.  We first identify hard problems that block us from achieving the performance, security and usability in the Aptos blockchain and its surrounding ecosystem.\n2.  We then focus on solving these problems, tracking our effort all along to drive significant production impact, and\n3.  Publish and celebrate the achieved results at top-tier venues.\n\nWe believe in this approach because the current landscape in the field of blockchain & Web 3.0 is full of significant problems, still open and unresolved, standing in the way of widespread adoption for billions of people across a broad set of use cases. More importantly, these problems span disciplines such as cryptography, distributed systems, programming languages, game theory, databases, networking and concurrency. To investigate and prioritize these problems, we rely on our close connection with our world-class engineering team and their intimate knowledge of the needs of the Aptos blockchain. Hence, we are in a unique and privileged position where solutions to most of the hard problems that we face are most likely going to be novel and publishable.\n\nWe understand that the research process can be [unpredictable and non-linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1U26PLiXjM). We may not solve every problem under all its constraints. Still, we search for solutions that do not fall apart when faced with the hard reality of a practical deployment. Our approach is to [“find a way, or make one”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inveniam_viam). We do not get stuck with extremes, such as stronger, unsolvable variants of the problem or oversimplified solutions that only work in convoluted academic settings.\n\n## Make publication worthy again\n\nWe aspire to advance the state of the art in blockchain technology. We welcome collaboration with others across the industry and academia who share the same goals. We dedicate significant effort to explain our results and share our knowledge via less technical and more educational mediums such as blog posts, talks and seminars.\n\nWe strive to publish results that we are proud of at the best possible venues. We never publish for the sake of publishing nor do we optimize artificial metrics.\n\nWe hold ourselves to the highest standards, requiring rigorous proofs of correctness for our protocols, and comprehensive experiments designed to leave no doubt in any of our claims. We utilize the academic review process as a tool to help us achieve this objective.\n\nIf we think our result is being unfairly judged, we start by first taking a hard look at ourselves, by asking hard questions and soliciting brutally-honest feedback from academics and other experts. We will not be blinded by appeasing the fragile ego of [reviewer #2](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1803) (e.g., *No, we will not reproduce our system and experiments on HyperLedger Fabric..*) nor ever develop an unhealthy fixation towards a particular venue or perceived academic prestige.\n\nIn other words, if the academic review process for a top-venue acceptance becomes too political or adversarial, we conclude that the overhead might not always be worth it. Instead, we let the ultimate judge of our contributions and impact be the time itself and the objectively-measurable metrics at the massive scale of the Aptos blockchain.\n\n## Make debate open again\n\nWe believe that open and direct discussions, even passionate debates at times, are the most healthy, efficient way for making progress. Crucial to this are mutual respect and mutual agreement:\n\n1.  To criticize the ideas and never the people, and\n2.  Trust that others are following (1).\n\nWe believe that by doing so, the best ideas will emerge and the best technology will make its way to the Aptos blockchain.\n\n## Make research deploy again\n\nWe consider advancing the frontier of our knowledge as a success metric for any research project. Therefore, we are not discouraged when an approach does not lead to real-world impact. However, when an approach does pull through, we take responsibility for seeing it implemented in production.\n\nIn other words, Aptos researchers lean into engineering: coding is not beneath them, but quite the opposite.\n\n[Research scientists](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/jobs/4005572005) at Aptos Labs combine foundational knowledge of the respective fields with the ability to speak the same language as the engineers, willingness to learn and grow, and follow the desire to deliver the projects to completion, possibly landing and owning the code in production.\n\n[Research engineers](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/jobs/4015672005) are instrumental to this process.

[@Zoezoe888zoe](https://twitter.com/Zoezoe888zoe) [@WhoKnowsDAO](https://twitter.com/WhoKnowsDAO)\n\n本期文字稿精选了6个 Space 中的精彩提问。\n\n编辑：三斤妹妹、定慧\n\n## 什么是 Social Fi ？为什么要 Fi 化那些资产？是否是伪命题？\n\n**pengsong：**\n\nSocial fi 与 Web2 最大的不同是：\n\n能够定义你社交关系的价值，并将其资产化、金融化。\n\n并且对个人（地址）进行赋能。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n**socailfi= social+fi**，是由 defi 到 gamefi 再到 socialfi 逐步演进的。**social 所涉及的人的广泛程度是最大的。**\n\n我认为 socailfi 的本质是通过 web3 的理念改变以往社交产品中的价值分配，让 web2 里别扭的地方通过激励系统的重新调配，去高效地完成供给层和需求平台在 social 层面上的交易撮合。\n\n但我觉得 social fi 是不是伪命题还需要靠验证。\n\nsocialfi 是目前所有“xfi”中唯一没有杀手级应用的词。从17、18年的尝试至今都没有跑出来一个真正有PMF的产品，因此我认为它是一个待被定义的词，如果长时间不被定义，这个词就会慢慢死掉，换做其他。当然这个问题背后的根本还是 web3 是不是完全的fi。\n\n**林川：**\n\n**social fi 更合适的称呼应该为“web3社交平台”**，虽然目前没有一个确切的定义，但我可以讲讲它不是什么。\n\n首先 social fi 不是 web2 社交产品的简单复刻；其次也不是 social to earn。\n\nsocial to earn的 主要问题在于奖惩激励很难明确化，很难防止用户互刷，产品本身的定位也会模糊掉。\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\nSocialfi 的核心是fi，token 和 NFT 所提供的金融和资产的工具让 web3 的社交产品对于价值分配和冷启动方面有更多可用的东西，至于重构好的产品是什么样的，目前还看不清楚。\n\n一直拘泥于 x to earn 的模式里很难逃脱旁氏的魔咒。因为金融化未必能给到用户最想要的东西，用户追求的主要功能还是交友、date、沟通与链接，金钱的过分加持会让人贪婪，不管是对单纯的用户也好还是在app里以挣钱为目的的一部分人。\n\n## Web2 领域有哪些可以借鉴的地方？\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n首先需要去理清产品的定位，即“社交”指的是什么？\n\n社交本身是一个被宽泛使用的概念，实际上在产品定位的坐标轴上是有不同程度和不同定位的，按照关系链强弱和内容占比，可以分为：\n\n**1.通信通讯类**\n\n**2.交友匹配类** (dating app / social network）\n\n**3.UGC社区类产品**\n\n**4.社交媒体**\n\n四种的产品的形态、设计重点、交付给用户的核心价值不同。\n\nSocialfi 中 fi 的概念可能是指：\n\n我们如何通过 token 的模型&方式，去重新做社交中的用户激励与利益分配？\n\n利益分配不止赚钱，例如 Dating APP 的匹配。\n\n至于 socialfi 里面的去中心化比重有多少，我认为可能没有办法做到全部环节的去中心化。\n\n比如说账号的新旧数据是用户自有的，无论是自己发的 UGC 内容还是新产生的社交图谱、关系链中的数据用户都可以自由处理与转移，这是去中心化的体现。但是最后很多环节可能避免不了要中心化，比如对于传统社交媒体和社交软件来说，它的一些核心能力与价值是掌握在平台当中的。\n\n比如对于dating app 来说核心是匹配算法，用户之间的匹配很难做到去中心化，因为会导致社交效率极低下。所以社交追求的是两件事，一个是找到的用户质量足够高，另一个是匹配精准用户的效率足够高。\n\n结合上面两点来看，我认为web3如果要将 social 和 fi 结合好，**用户质量、用户获得感、用户参与感、用户对资产的拥有和处理，**这些更偏质量的东西可能是优化的重点，而一些本身特别追求用户连接效率的社交模式不太适合做区块链的改造。\n\n## 目前对Web2社交产品的批评集中在哪些方面？Web3用户期待什么样的新社交产品？\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n如果是复刻 Web2 的产品。本身没有太大意义，因为对于用户来说除了有 token 可以挣以外并没有特别的价值。\n\n**而 token 本身的金融属性提供了很好的项目初期冷启动工具**，对前期圈一波用户有很大的帮助。比如说 Open DAO 和礼物空投 group，很可惜这两个项目后面没有能让用户留下来的产品。\n\n我体验过很多复刻，但是效果都不好。\n\n我认为从产品开发的角度讲应当跳开已有概念框架的约束去思考目前web3用户群体最大的痛点是什么，再根据痛点去找合适的产品方向。至少我发现很多人体感 discord 难用，以及安全事件屡屡发生，是否可以开发出一款专门针对 web3 用户的类 discord 通讯工具去解决用户最大的痛点与需求？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前对 web2 社交产品的批评更多集中在中心化和数据资产的所有权上，在国内这个问题不是用户直接体验到的。\n\n对于 web3 产品的新需求大家集中在社群的交流和管理的需求层面，因为目前还是用 web2 的产品discord 和 telegram 来代替的，它们毕竟不是原生的 web3 产品，各自都有一些问题。因此新的 web3产品需要瞄准用户的新需求与痛点，我赞同麻辣烫老师的观点去做 discord 的替代品，是具有一定的前景的。\n\n**陈不斯：**\n\n1\\.针对麻辣烫老师提出的痛点问题，人是否真的需要单独的社交产品？\n\nNot Boring 认为NFT是一种新型社交网络，因此是否需要一个单独平台去服务和承载是一个值得探索的思考的问题。\n\n2\\.如果社交产品是成立的，同时web3的金融属性不可避免，是否可以考虑本身就有一些经济属性或者逐利属性的社交行为？参考web2产品里的社交行为去用token经济模型改造。\n\n3\\.如果web3的金融属性可以被抛弃，发展到了用户足够大、圈层足够广泛和多样的时候，是否会跟web2产品遵循同样的方法论？“为工具而来，为网络而留”\n\nweb3相比web2来说最大的优势是互通性，代表用户的安全、隐私问题，给予用户足够的自主权，但是整体上面临的最大问题还是没有找到核心痛点让用户有动力从web2社交产品迁移到web3中去。\n\n**wegger：**\n\n很多赛道都在做socialfi的产品，发现了有以下特点：\n\n1\\.有门槛，通过爱好或者资产进行过滤。人们会偏好于小众社交，对身份的认同感在小圈子里支撑起来。\n\n2\\.socialfi在隐私领域的运营场景。\n\n3\\.技术差距不大，更倾向于思维和圈子层次的小众化，往小而精的方向发展。\n\n**taosha：**\n\nMake sense的场景：用户的数据算有权。不用证明自己做了什么事情，直接在链上数据可以看到相关资质。\n\n在招聘场景里，文凭可以作为一个 soulbound token（灵魂绑定代币），并绑定在一个作为 soul 的 did 上，不管是做 web3 领英或相亲平台，都可以从 did 的 soulbound token 中读取到我对文凭获得证明。\n\n对于项目来说，web3最大的红利是拉新获客很简单。过去我们需要在抖音、百度上买广告，而现在可以去扫描谁持有 BAYC (无聊猿)，就知道他很有钱，可以给他的地址空投一个 NFT 推销产品。\n\n在链上target用户较为精准和方便，更好地服务用户。\n\n**zoey：**\n\n思考两个问题：为了什么要做？为了谁去做？\n\nweb3 的价值定义：\n\n**1.让价值回归个体**\n\n**2.增强每个个体之间的情感链接**\n\n**3.不被平台控制的个人身份**\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n## 协议 vs 应用，对两个不同方向有什么看法？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前发展形态上是产品和协议之争。\n\n如果短期出现一个比较火的 web3 的社交产品做出圈的话，需要非常强的运营能力，单纯靠协议很难。长期看web3本身的基建更适合做重协议、轻应用的形态。\n\n大家更愿意接受社交关系和身份绑定，应用只调用社交关系，而不是到哪个产品都要再跑一遍社交关系。\n\n我长期更看好协议的发展，短期能出圈的可能还是重产品、重运营的一些社交应用。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n协议需要有用户共识，而 Social 更是直接对接终端用户\n\nSocial layer 的协议，应基于杀手级应用而诞生。\n\n因为协议是制定被大家所使用的规则，杀手级应用能为规则带来共识。\n\n特别是【社交图谱】，用户必须知道这个网友我是怎么认识的，就非常看重应用场景。所以如果要做社交图谱的协议，一定要从自带场景的 APP 起步。\n\n像 super connect 这样的项目没有这么做，我不是很能理解。\n\n**林川：**\n\nsuper connect 如果要出圈，应该会是各种想做社交的应用发现调用 super connect 这个协议会很方便，能给自己加一层社交关系，从而逐渐产生跟风效应火起来。\n\n**pengsong：**\n\n如何将 social 的记录从应用的中心化存储状态放上链，NFT可能是一个很好的选择。通过钱包地址中记录着社交关系的NFT 配合协议实现社交关系上链。\n\n但目前这个领域大家围绕 social 更多是 token 的这种经济设计，NFT 的底子比较薄弱，可能还需要半年一年的时间发展。\n\n思想转变：\n\n❌ Token 经济模型\n\n❌ 中心化数据库\n\n✅ NFT 关系网络\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n站在产业格局的角度，虽然区块链是“胖协议，瘦应用”\n\n但当A16z 对 web3 概念的炒作，其实这个概念背后蕴含着将 Web3 推广给更多用户的期待。\n\n更多的应用场景带来的不仅是对整个行业发展的促进，也意味着行业上下游的竞争。例如协议下场做应用，或应用上升做协议。\n\n因此未来可能是 **“胖协议，胖应用”** 的状态。\n\nSocial 协议提供的核心价值是什么？\n\n* 如果是数据（关系链、用户身份等），则会受应用层牵制，需要等待应用的发展与积累。难以像其它协议一样通过开发者快速迭代升级\n* 如果是技术，目前社交产品的开发门槛比较低，更看重运营，协议可能无法提供足够的价值。\n\n提升价值的建议：【数据】+【技术创新】+【增值服务】\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n## 如果是杀手级应用来开发协议的话，这个应用是否可能是由 Web2 的老家伙搞出来的？\n\n或者干脆是把 Web2 产品改造而来，例如马斯克改造推特的可能？\n\n如果说，推特能被马斯克私有化，不再服务于股东利益，通过把底层协议和用户关系贡献出来，将自己的平台价值颠覆掉，转型成一个社交公链，想象空间就太大了。\n\n而且对于web2巨头自我革命，恐怕只有马斯克有机会做到了\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\n反对，推特这样的巨鳄自我革命太难。\n\n更可能的路径是这样的：\n\n目前围绕各个公链，已经基于交易，形成了经济关系网络，而社区中空。\n\n（例如以太坊网络中60-70%的地址都在 Defi 热潮中参与了进来。但没有产品去承载这种社交关系）\n\n因此，围绕公链做社区才是方向。因为只要公链不死，关系网络就在。\n\n这是我看好的 Social fi 机会。\n\n**Eric：**\n\n看好 Web2 巨头带着自身存量转入 Web3\n\n因为网络效应太重，哪怕开发者达成共识追求理想，但难以与用户达成共识。\n\n可能只有用户的无感知迁移才行得通。\n\n**BillyWen：**\n\n曾经电报、电话时代，协议都是通的。例如你可以随时给美国朋友打电话。\n\nIM 即时通讯时代来临后，才出现应用层建墙圈用户，为了自身获利。\n\n目前 Web3 实现了货币和金融的无边界，相信未来的 web3 Social 一样没有边界。\n\n商业公司改革的确很困难，因为要追求利润。\n\n但未来10年如果有人站出来，做出了打破边界的 Social 变革，我相信他会被载入史册。\n\n**Beagle Dao：**\nWeb3 Social 有四个方面\n\n1. **基础设施、协议**\n   1. 例如 ENS 解决了钱包和名字的问题，通过 ENS 的身份社交，而非钱包地址。\n2. **社交凭证**\n   1. 例如 POAP，通过 NFT 证明你在哪里做过什么事\n3. **社交关系、社交图谱**\n4. **工具**\n   1. 【语音】例如：Clubhouse 、Twitter space\n   2. 【信息】例如：微信、邮件\n   3. 【内容】例如：推特、FB\n\n语音比较难做。\n\n信息类工具很多人在做，迁移成本高，平台不互动。\n\n可能需要大佬入场，强制或用更高的势能带动更多人加入\n\n因为 Web3 的社交关系都存在链上，所以不会像 Web2 那样重平台。\n\n更可能是共创式，每个人都做一点，拼成整个 Web3 社交的生态。\n\n观点：**Web3 社交会从B端生长出来。**\n\n对于C端而言，Web2 已经有足够好的产品了。\n\n更大的可能性是开发B端有普遍需求的工具&协议，因为B端自己懒的做而被广泛调用，因而普及。\n\n## Web2 是邪恶的吗？\n\n**Eric：**\n\n我并不认为web2 邪恶，至少有游戏规则\n\nweb2 榨取用户价值、用户体验受损的的矛盾会持续存在，但也与现在的资本市场玩法息息相关。例如开放平台都会缩回去，因为平台感觉自己把有价值的东西送出去，但却无法满足金主爸爸的期待。\n\n这种恶是人性的恶。只要 Web3 是人做的，我想一样会面对。\n\n**web3 的核心是改变价值体系，基于token 经济让系统中的各个角色都开心。**\n\n但从金融层面，怎么玩都是零和游戏。打破很难。\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n区块链不能解决人性的问题，从终局来看我会悲观，未来可能会出来新的不正义和垄断。\n\n而此刻他正在追求更公平，找到新的解决方案，这是我欣赏的。\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\nWeb3 的社交可能会更邪恶。\n\n当一个人的身份可以被 NFT 等链上方式充分定义，很多社交圈层将很容易通过技术建立门槛。你可能无法再通过找关系就加入一个大佬们会讨论问题的微信群、获得资源。可能因为你没进圈子，连吃瓜的资格都没有。\n\n但相应的，web2 当中很难走上颠覆（头部效应），在web3当中，你的努力更容易实现成功。\n\n**Red_Phoenix:**\n\n任何一个行业都有其宿命，都有其黑暗和光明。\n\n例如 Web2 的公司就一定会走向垄断和盈利，**而 Social 在 Web3 中的使命，可能是构建一个国家**，有自己共识、金融和分配方式。特别是当区块链的信用、生产力与线下产生链接时，就非常有想象力。\n\n——————————————\n\nWhoKnows DAO 将持续为大家组织优质的 Space、专题研究活动。\n\n如果你希望基于 Social fi

{"id": "npvnnKiIwTKL609RaO1knvbuC6YOuxXMn49SZiZNjq0", "title": "Aptos Incentivized Testnet Update - Aptoslabs - Medium", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*f7lwzW9yajAwsIbC4mD4Gw.jpeg)\n\nTwo weeks have passed since we first shared our plans for our [incentivized testnets](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-roadmap-209be695c77c). We are happy to share several exciting updates around eligibility requirements, selection process, expected participation slots, success criteria and rewards.\n\nBefore jumping into the details, we want to share some of our principles and goals of the Aptos Incentivized Testnet (AIT) process:\n\n*   Establish and promote the operator behavior that will lead to a successful Aptos Mainnet\n*   Emphasize the decentralized nature of the network\n*   Help foster an ecosystem for potential validator and fullnode operators\n*   Fairness and transparency in the selection process, success criteria, as well as the networks successes and failures\n\nTo those points above, we recognize that our timeline between the AIT1 registration and launch of the network places participants in a non-ideal position. This came to light as we explored the registration process, eligibility requirements, and startup time. To foster a fairer experience for all, we have adjusted the timeline for AIT1:\n\n*   May 13th — Registration date remains the same\n*   May 19th — The last day for registration\n*   May 23rd — Notification of acceptance\n*   May 24th — Beginning of AIT1\n\n## Eligibility Requirements and Registration\n\nIn order to participate in the incentivized testnet, participants must demonstrate the ability to configure and deploy a node as well as provide certain identifying information (name, residence or domicile, date of birth, etc.) and pass sanctions screening. On May 13th, we will launch a web portal that contains a registration page, instructions on how to configure and deploy your node, and node and registration status pages. Our registration site will validate that you have successfully prepared your node. At which point, you will be able to submit certain identifying information for verification and screening purposes. Upon successful completion of these tasks, you will be designated as “AIT Eligible”. The screening processes are usually fast but in some cases can take time to complete.\n\nDue to regulatory considerations within the US, US participants are able to participate but will be ineligible for token-based rewards. We are actively exploring the possibility of giving other non-token forms of rewards for successful participants based in the US, but there’s no guarantee that any such rewards will be available to US participants.\n\nAny rewards in connection with the incentivized testnet will be provided only following successful mainnet launch and any tokens provided will be subject to a one-year lockup period.\n\n## Selection Process\n\nTo be selected, you must first pass all the eligibility requirements. Beyond that we will be considering several other aspects including geographical distribution and applicant reputation. As part of the registration process, applicants will be required to specify the region in which they intend to deploy their node to ensure geographical distribution of validators. Participants that have failed in previous rounds or have exhibited dishonest behavior will be ineligible for future rounds. There will also be consideration toward applicant reputation as a node operator. Ultimately we are looking to enable general participation that helps solidify the launching of this network.\n\n## Participants, Success, and Rewards\n\n## **AIT1: Decentralized Startup**\n\n*   Number of participants: 100\n*   Success criteria\\\n    – Successfully startup node and pass liveness checks within 24 hours\\\n    – Availability more than 95% of all time\n*   Reward (non-US participants only): 500 Aptos tokens per successful participant\n\n## **AIT2: Staking**\n\n*   Number of participants: 100–500 nodes\n*   Success criteria\\\n    – Successfully startup node and pass liveness checks within 24 hours\\\n    – Availability more than 97% of all time\\\n    – Within the top 75% of consensus participants (consensus votes)\n*   Rewards (non-US participants only):\\\n    – Top 3 voter nodes get 5000, 2500, and 1000 Aptos tokens, respectively\\\n    – 500 Aptos tokens per successful participant\n\n## **AIT3: Governance and upgrades**\n\n*   Number of participants: 1000\n*   Success criteria\\\n    – Successfully startup node and pass liveness checks within 12 hours of nodes start time\\\n    – Availability more than 97% of all time\\\n    – Successfully participate in a standard network upgrade, 2 day response time\\\n    – Successfully participate in a hotfix network upgrade, 12 hour response time\\\n    – Within the top 75% of consensus participants (consensus votes)\n*   Rewards (non-US participants only):\\\n    – Top 3 voter nodes get 5000, 2500, and 1000 Aptos tokens, respectively\\\n    – 500 Aptos tokens per successful participant\n\n## **AIT4: Dynamic validator topology**\n\n*   Number of participants: 1000+\n*   Success criteria\\\n    – Successfully startup node and pass liveness checks within 12 hours of nodes start time\\\n    – The rest of the criteria is still being decided\n*   Reward (non-US participants only): 500 Aptos tokens per successful participant, additional rewards under consideration\n\n## Liveness checks are defined as your validator’s nodes ability to:\n\n*   Push metrics to Aptos telemetry\n*   Metrics port reporting metrics\n*   Connected to the official Aptos’ validator node\n*   Participating in consensus\n\n## Availability is defined as your validator node:\n\n*   Makes a proposal at least once per hour\n*   Is connected to the official Aptos’ validator node\n\n## What’s Next\n\nWe will post an announcement when the registration website launches on May 13th. In the meantime, star us on [GitHub](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aptoslabs), and join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tuDs9TmWwv) to follow along!\n", "timestamp": 1654770714, "digest": "KjZBM98CfIu1QnSUu9CoYgT13pP3JbLw-kurLNeMvCM", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}
{"id": "sLjGBw2CrD70c8IioEFJXCyIQEW5YeXGj68RgHH3Eps", "title": "区块链能否撑起元宇宙这片天", "body": "有人讲：Web3世界的尽头是元宇宙。这个观点为加密圈内人所认可。元宇宙的概念其实涵盖了我们的生活、工作与娱乐，是我们整个现实世界到虚拟世界的孪生，反过来又将会对我们的现实世界带来激烈的变革。但是，这片元宇宙的天空太大了，想要撑起来，除了VR/AR，甚至体全息等的视觉与触感，以及5G通讯和AI等技术突破外，实实在在离不开Web3的基石：区块链技术。\n\n区块链能否成为元宇宙的一根擎天柱？它能给元宇宙发展带来什么积极的作用？我们可以关注哪些这方向的区块链技术或领域?\n\n​        在这篇文章里，我们就将围绕这些问题，从元宇宙的概念和方向，以及区块链的现状和技术上，展开研究与分析，希望能为大家解开这些问题的谜团，为我们的投资或研发提供一些帮助。\n\n# 1. 什么是元宇宙？\n\n​        元宇宙，就是人类现实世界到虚拟世界一个投射：\n\n![图1 真实世界到元宇宙的投射](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mkJ9eQvJuckC4yjoPtiQy.png?height=635&width=807)\n\n​        从功能上讲，元宇宙是承载人们虚拟活动的平台，用户可以在其上进行社交、娱乐、创作、展示、教育，以及虚拟资产交易等，这些映射到我们现实世界中社会的、或精神的各方面活动。同时，它会有以下相较现实世界的突出特点：\n\n1. 没有准入门槛。\n2. 基于程序合约的公平性。\n3. 更加可靠的经济系统。\n4. 更加丰富的消费内容。\n\n​        同时，用户通过在元宇宙上进行创作、交易、学习或开会等活动，会与现实世界相结合而产生以下的感受：\n\n1. 沉浸式交互体验。\n2. 情感上的寄托。\n3. 心理上的归属。\n\n​        现在的元宇宙的Web3应用或公司，主要是以游戏为主，或者围绕着游戏而生，比如`Decentraland`、`Roblox`。因此，有人把游戏列为元宇宙的4大支柱技术（显示、通信、区块链与游戏）之一。这点其实是有失偏颇的，因为元宇宙所能承载的将不仅仅是游戏。所以应该是Web3应用，正是由这些应用板块，组成了元宇宙里的社区。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙的本质是要自由可信地承载人们的社交身份和资产权益，以及围绕着这两个的，可与现实世界相映射的所有活动。这些活动体现在元宇宙里，就是一个个Web3的应用。这其实是对现实世界底层逻辑的复制，使得元宇宙成为了一个很好的平台，让任何用户可以在它的上面创建或加入社区，参与创造，而且劳动的成果将得到保障。因此，人们在元宇宙里的劳动、交易与现实中的劳动与交易没有区别：用户在`Dencentraland`里建造的虚拟房子，可以不受平台限制，轻松交易，换成元宇宙甚至现实世界里的物品，其价格将由自由市场决定。\n\n![图2 人在元宇宙与现实世界的关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_1PcbubH_yO1UWTjXewEZ.png?height=383&width=808)\n\n​        上述元宇宙的活动，要比现实世界更加方便与可靠。因为它充分利用了区块链技术的去中心化协议与经济激励规则，通过分布式系统和程序，来保障元宇宙上活动的有序执行，与资产的抗审查确权。\n\n​        但是有人要问了：元宇宙里不管是从现实世界里采样的信息，还是直接在元宇宙里生成的信息，随着元宇宙的繁荣，就要生成现实世界方方面面的数字孪生；这对于区块链来讲，就是超多的交易，超大的数据，现在的区块链，或区块链技术（比如以太坊），能支撑的住吗？\n\n# 2. 元宇宙希望区块链提供哪些支撑？\n\n​        我们先来看看元宇宙当前主要的应用有哪些：\n\n1. 媒体舆情：像VeeR、斗鱼等主要是利用VR+5G的技术，把当下流行Web2的视频点播或VR游戏，简单搬移到了元宇宙上；倒是有个有趣的现象是视频网站从元宇宙的卡通人物里吸取灵感，给主播选换元宇宙头像，在Web2的视频网站上大受欢迎。\n2. 社交游戏：这个是最贴合元宇宙属性的场景，像腾讯就借微信、QQ的用户量在积极拓展元宇宙社交，而网易游戏、米哈游也从游戏角度纷纷杀入元宇宙。\n3. 电商会展：电商直播与电商税收成为国家整治对象，最近的疫情给会展业带来了重创，而元宇宙让电商会展看到新的契机，百度与华为都在这块有着积极的尝试。\n4. 教体文卫：这个也是元宇宙切入比较多的板块，像腾讯就联合敦煌打造元宇宙数字原生NFT，倡导元宇宙游赏敦煌石窟的游玩。\n5. 智能制造：就智能制造本身而言，它是独立的，但我们应该看到，像有些高级制造与高级维修，由于高端师傅的稀缺，因而对于分散的门店或工厂，具有远程指导与治理的真实需求，这个也是与元宇宙相契合的，但我个人只看到一些汽车的后端市场，会用到AR远程指导，还没有真正迁移到元宇宙。\n6. 政治军事：比较容易想到的利用元宇宙的3D仿真城市管理与实战演练了。\n7. 其他应用：除了以上6大类，目前对元宇宙有所涉略的还包括：数字金融、房地产、产业园和农业等。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙所能涵盖的应用或业务，远不至这些，我们大可以从经济、社会、生产、科技、教育和生活诸多方面，展开极限想象：元宇宙里资源无限，因此人们只为快乐而干活；社会将由人治走向法治，再到数学治的转变；从此创意是唯一的技能，什么学这学那的，都不需要，只要保持创造性思维能力就掌握了生产力；在元宇宙的世界里，科技似乎真的有机会触达神灵，因为元宇宙里有不断自我演进的人类智慧；学习的精髓不再是记忆而是遗忘，因为元宇宙会随时帮您记忆，并修正你曾记错的地方；生活真得将变得如此简单，互联网给大家带来的便利有目共睹，元宇宙肯定将让我们世界变得更加方便、更加简单。\n\n​        天下没有免费的午餐，元宇宙是很美好，但它离不开科技，工程，以及底层各技术的框架的支撑。下面是赵国栋老师关于元宇宙的技术框架图：\n\n![图3 元宇宙技术框架图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dj8bYtFeMXlSkbvBCtmfW.png?height=538&width=1247)\n\n​        其中红框处的`去中心化层`就是我们这里所关心的区块链。虽然赵老师这个图很好地表述了元宇宙的架构，但没能清楚地表述区块链的组成，及其层次逻辑，所以我们更乐意用下面一张图来理解元宇宙中的区块链：\n\n![图4 自商业（BAO）区块链层次架构图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rHQGobOnEIbk36fXDlU2h.png?height=390&width=664)\n\n​        这张图是ENChain.Asia的朱峰在BAO的白皮书里第一次提出`自商业`的框架图，它与元宇宙Web3应用的自主经营比较吻合。但该图里还没有很好地体现Web3应用的业务。我们知道，Web3应用其实是由两部分组成的：\n\n1. 后端：也就是运行在区块链网络上的业务处理逻辑。\n2. 前端：也就是我们一般用户看到的Web页面等。\n\n![图5 区块链业务与区块链之间的层次关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7aALil7Ix8GlpuBmckluL.png?height=484&width=664)\n\n​        其中淡橙色部分组成了元宇宙Web3应用的业务部分。而后端我们把激励层、治理层、仲裁层和合规层理解为Web3应用在区块链上，基于智能合约的逻辑处理部分，同时，为了适应元宇宙`去中心化自主治理`的业务诉求，还整合进了`自商业` 的逻辑。\n\n​        另外，也有人把区块链比作元宇宙的粘合剂，通过把终端、云计算、AI、大数据与网络相关整合一起，为元宇宙的实现建立起底层的技术基础：\n\n![图6 区块链与元宇宙其它构件关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa9gDAW30NAGrpspG1NYT.png?height=542&width=634)\n\n​        通过上面4张图，我们大体可以理解区块在元宇宙体系里，所处的位置和大概作用。下面我们来进一步分析元宇宙，期望区块链可以提供哪些基础的功能，来支撑它重建一个新世界的远大目标。\n\n​        为了更好地分析，我们把元宇宙关于区块链的诉求，分成一般性需求，和特殊性需求来看。\n\n1. 一般性需求，也就是针对一般Web3应用就需要的。\n2. 特殊性需求，则是元宇宙具体特殊的需求。\n\n​        首先，跑在元宇宙的业务应用肯定也是Web3应用，因此我们可以看到元宇宙，会对区块链提出4类一般性需求：\n\n1. 一种自我激励可靠的去中心化网络，来承载元宇宙的业务。\n2. 一种共识可信的超级账本，来记录元宇宙中活动的点点滴滴。\n3. 一种分布式的不可篡改存储，来确保元宇宙数据的真实性。\n4. 一种基于智能合约的法则，来有效约束各参与方的行为规范。\n\n​        另外，元宇宙作为一个创造新世界的庞大复杂的系统，它应会考虑以下6点，区块链不能成为它的瓶颈：\n\n1. 要能支持几乎无限丰富的应用场景。\n2. 要能支持高并发的交易量。\n3. 要能支持大吞吐的数据量。\n4. 要能与现实世界流畅沟通。\n5. 要能确保隐私。\n6. 商业经营高度自治等。\n\n​        对于一般性需求而言，众所周知，正是区块链技术所擅长的；也正是因为区块链拥有了这些能力，也给了大家想象元宇宙的空间。但元宇宙反过来，则又对区块链提出了更高的要求。下面我们重点关注**区块链可不可能支撑元宇宙的这些更高要求**？\n\n# 3. 区块链能否撑起元宇宙？\n\n## 3.1 不可能三角原则\n\n​        在回答这个问题之前，我们先来认识一下区块链的不可能三角原则。因为它将是我们下面立论的基础。\n\n![图7 区块链不可能三角](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wdG-9nqL4w2qzDiIH-nX0.png?height=569&width=940)\n\n​        区块链不可能三角（blockchain trilemma）由以太链创始人Vitalik 提出：也就是说区块链技术不能同时实现去中心化性程度、安全性和高效性。其中：\n\n1. 去中心化是指拥有大量区块生产和验证的节点，一般节点越多，去中心化程度越高。\n2. 安全性是获得网络控制权所要花费的成本，通常在共识机制的设计中锚定现实世界的资产，例如工作量证明机制锚定的是算力。\n3. 高效性就是每秒处理交易的笔数。\n\n​        正是不可能三角原则，使得各种区块链的设计与实现中，只能三者舍其一：要么是确保资本安全，共识基础牢靠；要么是单位吞吐量大，交易费便宜；要么是数据存储技术出众，存储费低廉。这也就导致现在难有一条链，或一种链就可以支撑起元宇宙的特殊需求。\n\n## 3.2 各具特色的区块链\n\n### 3.2.1 大小王\n\n​       首先就是2008年由中本聪发布的`比特币`，它标识了区块链1.0的诞生，一举奠定了区块链的思想与关键技术，是名符其实的区块链大王。比特币带给我们的区块链特征包括：\n\n1. 以区块组成的链条存储交易信息或数据。\n2. 整个区块链网络所共识且共享的超级账本，确保账本的真实性。\n3. 应用了非对称加密算法，通过公钥与私钥结合的方式搭建了区块链的安全防御系统。\n4. 源代码公开，使得区块链网络中设定的共识机制、规则等都可以通过一致的、开源的源代码进行验证。\n5. 贯彻去中心化的思想，包括中本聪到底是何许人也，到现在也不知道（否则中本聪在区块链领域的话语权要比V神大）。\n6. P2P的分布式网络，区块链网络将是去中化的分布式网络。\n\n![图8 区块链分布式网络拓扑](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Nx2DtHYV6tFddTMbucZq.png?height=638&width=641)\n\n​        人们看到，比特币在不可能三角中，特别注重了`去中心化`与`安全`,所以它的TPS特别低，且延时长；而且它脚本类的链上程序不是图灵完备的。虽然区块链1.0比较好地解决了货币发行与支付的去中心化，但应用场景还是很受限。为此区块链的小王以太坊，由Vitalik Buterin于2013年创建，它标识着区块链2.0的诞生。\n\n​        `以太坊`在比特币的基础上，创建了一个图灵完备的虚拟机EVM。因此，人们可以在以太坊上编写智能合约；理论上，可以在该EVM上实现任何复杂的逻辑。为此，Ｖ神在以太坊诞生之初，喊出了以太坊要成为`世界计算机`的口号。\n\n![图9 以太坊基于智能合约的运行机制](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9KWA4oVRVdgjIE1bXSDgI.png?height=431&width=959)\n\n​        但是以太坊的设计虽然有不少创新，但终究是脱胎于比特币，还是过于关注货币的安全与去中心化，因此它的TPS也不高，而基于智能合约的旺盛业务需求，导致了时常区块爆炸和交易费高昂等诸多问题。\n\n​        不管怎样，由于多年下来，用户没有更好的选择，以太坊业已成为Web3应用开发的首选，和业界标杆。\n\n### 3.2.2 廉价的存储\n\n​        以太坊通过智能合约，解决了市场交易的去中心化。但对用户来讲，这些交易会伴随大量的数据，而且用户也会有需要数据确权存储的需求（这点在元宇宙里将会显得特别突出）。但对于以太坊这类区块链来讲，不是功能上实现不了，而是性能上难以满足：\n\n1. `$10000+/GB年`的费用，让一般用户无法接受。\n2. `13 x 6 = 78s`的延时，让音、视频实时播放类业务只能望而止步。\n\n​        为此，Filecoin与Arweave，抓住这个痛点，纷纷推出了自己的存储区块链，以及配套的服务。我们就以Filecoin为例，来看看它是如何实现高效的数据存储与访问的。\n\n![图10 IPFS/Filecoin数据存储](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WB0EKDJaGGSus0Sg44qwI.png?height=895&width=1600)\n\n​        Filecoin如上图所示，它其实是一个体系，基于区块链的技术，来支持可靠、快速，却又廉价的链上数据存储与访问服务。其中：\n\n1. 右下部分，它实现了Filecoin基础区块链部分：\n\n* 它是标准的P2P区块链网络，但该网络只是负责存储交易及FIL激励相关事务，并不存储用户数据（比如音、视频）；\n* 数据的存储是由该网络上的各个参与节点与用户达成数据存储与访问的deal(这个交易是要上FIlecoin区块链的)，再根据IPFS格式，在节点上封装扇区，并存储数据；但该节点要负责通过ZK技术生成PoRep和PoSt证明，交给Filecoin区块链网络共识。\n\n​        事实上，存储到Filecoin网络上速度也不快，它一般只会做48小时内完成承诺，而且允许超大数据量的存储在链下完成。所以Filecoin网络上的数据存储，也被称作冷存储。\n\n1. 顶上部分，它就是实现的星际文件系统IPFS，以便基于文件的内容，并支持大数据量的存储与访问：\n\n* IPFS也是个P2P的分布式网络，但并不是区块链，因此它上面的活动并不需要共识，只是利用了分布式网络冗余备份功能；\n* 所以IPFS又被称作热存储，在Filecoin体系被用作Cache技术；\n* 但缓存在内存空间不足时很容易被清除，这样会导致用户通过IPFS请求Filecoin的存储服务，很可能会在没有完成冷存储之前，就被清除了；因此在顶部右上角，又增加了一个IPFS PIN Service，来确保用户数据可以在IPFS这个分布式网络里保存足够长的时间。\n\n1. 另一个就是上图右边的`web3.storage`之类的网关服务了，它提供了RPC API，方便用户轻松访问Filecoin网络。\n\n​        可以看到，Filecoin在充分利用区块链技术的同时，还充分结合了链外的以下辅助技术，才得以实现便宜的、支持大吞吐的、安全可信的数据存储与访问的服务：\n\n1. 零知识证明；\n2. 分布式集群；\n3. SaaS网关等。\n\n​        通过Filecoin一组产品体系的设计，它可以在获取不可能三角的去中心化和安全基础上，还获得了链上数据大吞吐访问的高效性。当然，现在大家使用下来，感觉IPFS上数据下载还是慢，这个倒是应该通过增加IPFS集群的并发处理能力，以及Web3.Storage等API网关的网络带宽来解决。\n\n### 3.2.3 突破交易量的瓶颈\n\n​        继了解决大吞吐数据存储方案后，那再来看元宇宙关于支持交易高并发的诉求。我们都知道，比特币原始链和以太链的交易并发数并不多，时延反而长，交易费反而高：\n\n![表1 比特币与以太坊TPS等性能](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4jUkffUHKsGKaI7O5ok-6.png?height=292&width=1267)\n\n​        这些弱点，仅让以太坊或比特币来支持元宇宙是不可能的。也正是看到这些弱点，各Layer2扩容方案纷纷出台，或者有的链干脆另起炉灶，完全设计出一条独立的支持高交易量的链：\n\n1. Layer2 扩容方案：它的思想本质就是通过将交易的处理从Layer1的区块链，迁移到了被称Layer2层，并对该处理生成一个证明，而Layer1层只作关于该证明的验证；而验证证明的计算量小很多，从而可以大幅地降低Layer1层区块链的负荷，也就提升了整个区块链业务TPS；当然Layer2层还会用到Sequenser等排序与压缩技术，来进一步提高TPS；目前Layer2的扩容路线主要是Rollup，它能实现Layer1层1\\~2个数量级的扩容。\n\n![图11 Layer2扩容方案](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4JES24OdSA0OKMoR9DHFI.png?height=214&width=600)\n\n1. Layer1独立链交易量的极致突破：它直接让Layer1区块链本身拥有更高的TPS；它往往是以牺牲安全或去中心化来获取更高的单位时间交易量；其中典型的案例有Solana，它的设计中一个时间点只有一个Leader节点出块，而其它的节点只对块中的交易进行验证；因为它的出块，再不是区块链网络里所有节点竞争，所以它会快许多，但显然安全性会下降许多；为此Solana设计了随时间单向的PoH协议，以及TowerBFT协议等，来尽量弥补单个Leader出块中心化不安全的弱点；Solana的TPS可达5万+。\n\n![图12 Solana架构](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J9s2wlVpj7aqm2F7qR-7Y.png?height=713&width=1244)\n\n​          据Solana白皮书介绍，基于Solana链的交易量瓶颈不再在链本身，而在网络带宽。\n\n### 3.2.4 跨链\n\n​        从前面3个小节的分析，我们确实可以看到，区块链有的去中化程度高，安全可靠，有的可以突破TPS瓶颈，有的则可以很好满足便宜可信大数据量的存储。这些都是元宇宙所需要的。为此，除了独立区块链分布式网络相关的技术外，还需要相关跨链技术，把不同的区块链连接起来，促使它们之间货币信息的流通，甚至可以互操作。对应着这种技术的产品，被大家形象地称为跨链桥。\n\n​        V神把跨链技术的演进和实现方式，总结为3类：\n\n1. 哈希时间锁合约：通过一套密码学方法，来实现不同链上资产的交易；但只能是资产类交易，不能实现资产在不同链上流通，更不能互操作了；下面2张图就显示了基于哈希锁和时间锁，实现将比特币交换成以太的过程：\n\n![图13 存币上锁](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GHT0_1ieqENqiDYTSv4Vl.png?height=87&width=621)\n\n![图14 开锁取币](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HkZWHPwe6oruFM7Vxscat.png?height=76&width=600)\n\n1. 公证人机制：是由公证人建立一个中间账户，用户将资产转入中间账户，由公证人跨链发行一种映射原Token的影子Token给到用户；当用户需要赎回的时候，将影子Token销毁，并向公证人提供证明，公证人将中间账户的原始Token转到该用户的地址；基于公证人的方案，可以实现资产在不同链，或异构链上流通；但这个流通的可信度，是依赖于这个第三方公证人可信度的。\n2. 桥接链方案：它是当前主流的跨链技术；与公证人方案一样，仍然存在一个中间账户，但中间账户的安全，不靠公证人来保护，而是靠智能合约来规范，这意味着中间账户将是一个合约账户，其资产管理规则被智能合约的代码约束，而不是由公证人约束；如果代码本身没有问题，只要部署该合约的链是安全的，那么合约中的资产就是安全的；像波卡和Cosmos不仅要实现支持资产流通，甚至支持它们同构子链之间的互操作。\n\n​        要说明的一点是：桥接链应搭建在双图灵完备的链间，因为桥接链不是一个独立的存在，而需要部署在两端链上的合约配合，就像一座桥不能悬空存在，必须在两岸有桥墩作为依托一样。\n\n![图15 桥接链示意](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Syb4-mlnSJTO4nLF8Ytqb.png?height=312&width=604)\n\n​        而桥接链方案又可分成3个流派：\n\n1. 通用跨链派：它专注于跨链，旨在实现适配区块链领域存在的所有链，其典型代表是Polygon\n\n![图16 Polygon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ypmulFxPaLzQodIhTVLnq.png?height=328&width=602)\n\n​        上图中的蓝色图标就表示是Polygon。但细心的你会发现它是以`以太坊`为中心的。因为Polygon的目标是`实现一个以太坊兼容链的互联网`。但我们前面讨论了，在元宇宙里，除了以太坊，还需要有诸如Filecoin等的区块链网络；并且对于元宇宙业务应用来讲，尽管以太坊已成为许多人认可的`世界记账机`，也不一定就是中心（区块链应该排斥中心的）。\n\n1. 引流跨链派：它往往是Layer1的独立链，需要借用以太坊更丰富的货币体系，以及引流以太坊上大量的免教育用户，其典型代表有Solana Wormhole\n\n![图17 Solana Wormhole](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pjTsdcJKkZ28zPrfW1hZh.png?height=410&width=539)\n\n​        Wormhole在以太坊与Solana之间，搭建一条双向、去中心化的 ERC-20⇄SPL 代币桥。Solana主打的这条`trustless`桥，让以太坊的DeFi交易者和应用，在两条链上进行资产转换，并享受Solana的高TPS和低转账成本的服务；而且基于Wormhole，开发者可以继续使用之前为以太坊编写的智能合约。细心的你有可能发现上图左下角的`Terra`作为Luna的基础链，已经崩了；这里还选用这张图，主要是想警示大家，在通过跨链技术，连接不同区块链时，注意链想到之间产生`连环雪崩`灾害；这是元宇宙安全所在，由于安全问题不在是本篇文章的重点，就不展开了。\n\n1. 互操作跨链流派：它不仅要实现不同链之间代币的流通，更专注于链之间的`互操作`,链之间真正的互联互通，其典型代表有Polkadot最新发布的XCM\n\n![图18 波卡XCMP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a4hSares12VFUJ0EjIS4w.png?height=272&width=523)\n\n​        XCM是波卡的跨共识消息格式（Cross-Consensus Messaging format）的简称，XCM不仅支持链之间的通信，还支持智能合约、Dapp和Substrate pallet（模块）之间的通信，从而实现了不同链之间的消息传递，与类似RPC调用的互操作。但我们也应看到：XCM不能用于在系统之间实际“发送”任何消息，它的效用只在于表达接收者应该做什么；XCM是消息格式，需要搭配消息传递协议使用，才能完成消息的跨链。还有就是，XCM只适用于Polkadot家族中的平行链之间的跨链。\n\n​        通过上面的分析我们可以知道，由于不同链之间的共识机制，所有虚拟机和智能合约架构的不同，链之间的互联互通，还是有不少难度。但经过不同厂商的努力，我们也看到现在的跨链桥技术，已基本可以将不同的功能的区块链技术捏合在一起，来打破区块链的不可能三角，从而满足以元宇宙既要去中心化，又要安全，还要高效的诉求。\n\n​        另注：跨链桥这块，作者推荐大家关注Polkadot与Cosmos之类专注链互操作的区块链体系。因为它们理论上可以构建各种功能和特色的链，而且这些链在同一体系下，在设计之初，就充分考虑了跨链互联的需求。\n\n## 3.3 满足不可能三角之后呢？\n\n​        通过3.2节的分析，我们知道，基于跨链桥技术，可以将具有不同功能与特色的链连接起来，从而使得不可能三角的安全性、去中心化和高效性的三者兼得。但元宇宙的特殊需求尚不止于此。\n\n### 3.3.1 可用不可见的隐私计算\n\n​        元宇宙尽管是个虚拟世界，但其中还是关联到现实生活中的，会附带着各种数字资产，以及大量的个人隐私信息。所以在元宇宙里往往会采用DID（去中心化的身份证），来绑定用户在元宇宙里的身份，并进而把与之相关的资产和数据归之名下。\n\n​        这个小节我们主要谈谈用户链上数据隐私保护的问题。我们可以发现以下几点前提：\n\n1. 首先，这些数据要是为元宇宙所有用户认可的，所以数据就应存放在去中心化的区块链网络上，比如Filecoin。\n2. 为了保护隐私，这些数据应是加密存储，只有用户自身才能读取其中的内容。\n3. 但这些隐私数据如果元宇宙不能使用，那就无法提取该用户的相关属性，也难以为该用户提供更好的服务。\n\n![图19 元宇宙渔业监管](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1fQLBoiODE8PdrAiTGpVX.png?height=391&width=762)\n\n​        如上图，`元宇宙渔业监管部门`需要监查`元宇宙渔船`是否超出了捕捞海域，需要渔船的`元宇宙海域坐标`；渔船认为该坐标信息是它的隐私，不便提供；而监管部门没有坐标是没有办法监管。因此现实世界里，只能由监管部门强制收取，最后由于职权部门的泄密，导致个人安全或利益受损，个人往往也只能认倒霉。\n\n​        我们知道，数据的处理包括三个环节：传输、存储与计算。其中，传输、存储的安全已有相关技术，但数据的`安全计算`一直没有一条通用性的方案，也就是讲，现有的数据安全计算方案，往往只能应用于特定的场景。我们对数据安全计算的目标，主要定位在`数据可用不可见`上，所以又将数据安全计算，称为`隐私计算`。由于数据已成为最重要的生产资料，隐私计算将显得越来越重要。当前的主要的隐私计算技术分类有：\n\n![图20 隐私计算分类](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VboHK1kz7SirkXmQMJJID.png?height=241&width=1370)\n\n        基于以上分析，元宇宙也是需要隐私计算的技术，来确保用户隐私数据的`可用不可见`；而且为了节约网络带宽资源，实现的隐私计算功能模块，**应当贴近区块链端**。其中`零知识证明`技术，已在区块链里被广泛使用。前面我们提到过，像Filecoin里的PoRep与PoSt就利用了零知识证明。但这项技术只能证明数据存储行为本身，并不能从该数据里抽取有用的属性，比如渔船越界了。为此，在元宇宙里，还应充分利用`联邦学习`，`可信执行环境`等技术，并把它们有机结合起来：\n\n1. 搭建`联邦学习`等AI计算集群，提供支持保护隐私的神经网络训练与预判环境，为元宇宙提供类似人工智能感知层，但这个感知是去中心化的。\n2. 搭建可信执行环境，由于该环境需要支持AI的训练与计算，所以元宇宙里的可信执行环境是服务器集群级别，与手机和安全卡之类的可信执行环境，在物理上不是一个量级。\n\n​        其是在元宇宙里联邦学习集群与可信执行环境集群，可以合二为一，形成一种类似`PaaS`的服务。作者认为，这应该是元宇宙的一项基础构件，像元宇宙中社区自治（DAO）中，特别倚重的声誉系统，没有AI，没有确保隐私的AI，学习性、公正性、有效性就难以保证。想要建立元宇宙的良性生态，不妨先把这个基础服务做起来。如果您看好元宇宙，这将是一块真正的`busyness`。但目前似乎少有企业或组织，真正把它当作业务，或者以PaaS、BaaS的眼光来看待它。\n\n### 3.3.2 Oracle沟通物理世界\n\n​        通过3.3.1小节的讨论，我们通过采用多种隐私计算技术，可以保障元宇宙中用户个体数据的隐私安全。但如果区块链相以支撑起元宇宙，我们认为尚有不足，因为元宇宙不仅仅是现实世界的搬迁，它还需要与物理世界的交流与互动。像海尔在组建的元宇宙工厂，如不与现实工厂相关联，对海尔来讲是没有意义的。\n\n​        元宇宙与物理世界的交互，其实就是物理世界信息要更新到元宇宙的区块链网络中，而区块链网络处理的结果，应该反映到现实中去。这种交互，就需要所谓的Oracle技术（预言机）。该技术在DeFi里使用比较多，其中典型的代表就是Chainlink。\n\n![图21 Chainlink Oracle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i84z-1bztLjgvRtgBUsZe.png?height=365&width=591)\n\n​        它的工作机制是：\n\n```\n  1. Chainlink构成了一个去中心化的分布式网络，并通过Oracle合约与以太坊等区块链锚定。\n  2. 用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Adapter服务；该服务会从不物理信源处采集所需要的信息，比如各DEX关于LINK Token的价格，进行汇总，并根据用户的喜好采用这些信息，调用Oracle合约，自动触发相关的链上交易。\n  3. 链上的逻辑处理完好，又可以调用Oracle合约，将信息返回给Chainlink网络；用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Initiator服务；该服务根据Oracle返回的信息，再触发现实世界的相关交易。\n```\n\n​        元宇宙与现实世界的沟通，也需要诸如Chainlink之类的Oracle技术：使得两个世界息息相生。\n\n### 3.3.3 DAO\n\n​        经过上面的分析，我们就来看看最后一个点：那就是元宇宙的商业自治。这个诉求与区块链的DAO是极其吻合的。\n\n![图22 DAO示意](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KTYENeIiMoYbUyLwoLgbR.png?height=402&width=601)\n\n​        DAO是指去中心化自治组织，它伴随区块链而诞生，并一经出现，就热度不减。因为它有以下鲜明的特点：\n\n1. 去中心化、自动化和透明，所有要遵守的规则都由链上公开的智能合约来定。\n2. 社区驱动，规则的决定与调整，也就是组织的决策权，赋予社区里所有的代币持有者，由大家投票裁决；往往这种权力是与社员持有代币量成正比；因而让社区成为利益休戚相关且真正民主。\n3. 具有潜在的投资回报，DAO中所持有的治理代币，正如初创公司早期持有的股权：后面一旦成功，这些代币会非常有价值。\n\n​        这里，我们应将DAO的治理代币，与区块链的原生代币区别开来。原生代币是区块链网络为了维护其网络生态繁荣的经济激励措施而发行，从某种意义上讲，是存在类似`货币超发`现象，或讲超前消费嫌疑。而DAO的治理代币，它应是绑定在社区实际的成长上的：只有社区有价值，它的治理代币才会有价值。当然，不可否认，DAO的治理代币也起着经济激励的基础作用，如第2章中的7层架构中的`激励层`所示，它将给予社区美好的预期，促进社区成员，为着共同的目标一起努力。这点是与元宇宙的自商业完全一致。\n\n​        但是，我们也要看到DAO的一个致命的弱点：什么事都要靠投票来决定。这样，当有问题时，特别是重大紧急问题时，也要通过投票解决？2016年以太坊的`The Dao`事故，仍然历历在目。以太坊的做法是人为干涉，但这又与去中心化思想相悖，从而为人所诟病，并由此导致了以太坊的硬分叉。所以，元宇宙在社区自治过程中，还应设计好此类事件的应对方案。\n\n# 4. 结论\n\n​        元宇宙还有很长的路要走，但它美好的前景，值得Facebook去投入，也值我们所有人去追寻。元宇宙少不了区块链，这点已为业界共识。同时，从上面的分析来看，通过组合不同的区块链，以及隐私计算等相关技术，是有机会支撑起元宇宙的各类应用，以及对大家对元宇宙未来的畅想。\n\n​        当然，区块链相关的技术还有待发展，这也何尝不是机会。作者认为，我们可以重点关注：\n\n1. 开放式的跨链桥技术，将元宇宙需要的各种链有机、灵活地连接起来。\n2. 集成联邦学习与可信执行环境集群的BaaS服务。\n3. 具有通识基础的元宇宙声誉系统，打造元宇宙的DAO，建立基于`数字治`的良序公约。", "timestamp": 1654770879, "digest": "hYOaJFFtLrlJ3_CSClzJo_hAwKYb9-6w6dwK1_WaLQM", "contributor": "0x8fB6C85590aC6fFd0Dc31A95800C084F2DaAb5fe"}

"有人讲：Web3世界的尽头是元宇宙。这个观点为加密圈内人所认可。元宇宙的概念其实涵盖了我们的生活、工作与娱乐，是我们整个现实世界到虚拟世界的孪生，反过来又将会对我们的现实世界带来激烈的变革。但是，这片元宇宙的天空太大了，想要撑起来，除了VR/AR，甚至体全息等的视觉与触感，以及5G通讯和AI等技术突破外，实实在在离不开Web3的基石：区块链技术。\n\n区块链能否成为元宇宙的一根擎天柱？它能给元宇宙发展带来什么积极的作用？我们可以关注哪些这方向的区块链技术或领域?\n\n​        在这篇文章里，我们就将围绕这些问题，从元宇宙的概念和方向，以及区块链的现状和技术上，展开研究与分析，希望能为大家解开这些问题的谜团，为我们的投资或研发提供一些帮助。\n\n# 1. 什么是元宇宙？\n\n​        元宇宙，就是人类现实世界到虚拟世界一个投射：\n\n![图1 真实世界到元宇宙的投射](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mkJ9eQvJuckC4yjoPtiQy.png?height=635&width=807)\n\n​        从功能上讲，元宇宙是承载人们虚拟活动的平台，用户可以在其上进行社交、娱乐、创作、展示、教育，以及虚拟资产交易等，这些映射到我们现实世界中社会的、或精神的各方面活动。同时，它会有以下相较现实世界的突出特点：\n\n1. 没有准入门槛。\n2. 基于程序合约的公平性。\n3. 更加可靠的经济系统。\n4. 更加丰富的消费内容。\n\n​        同时，用户通过在元宇宙上进行创作、交易、学习或开会等活动，会与现实世界相结合而产生以下的感受：\n\n1. 沉浸式交互体验。\n2. 情感上的寄托。\n3. 心理上的归属。\n\n​        现在的元宇宙的Web3应用或公司，主要是以游戏为主，或者围绕着游戏而生，比如`Decentraland`、`Roblox`。因此，有人把游戏列为元宇宙的4大支柱技术（显示、通信、区块链与游戏）之一。这点其实是有失偏颇的，因为元宇宙所能承载的将不仅仅是游戏。所以应该是Web3应用，正是由这些应用板块，组成了元宇宙里的社区。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙的本质是要自由可信地承载人们的社交身份和资产权益，以及围绕着这两个的，可与现实世界相映射的所有活动。这些活动体现在元宇宙里，就是一个个Web3的应用。这其实是对现实世界底层逻辑的复制，使得元宇宙成为了一个很好的平台，让任何用户可以在它的上面创建或加入社区，参与创造，而且劳动的成果将得到保障。因此，人们在元宇宙里的劳动、交易与现实中的劳动与交易没有区别：用户在`Dencentraland`里建造的虚拟房子，可以不受平台限制，轻松交易，换成元宇宙甚至现实世界里的物品，其价格将由自由市场决定。\n\n![图2 人在元宇宙与现实世界的关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_1PcbubH_yO1UWTjXewEZ.png?height=383&width=808)\n\n​        上述元宇宙的活动，要比现实世界更加方便与可靠。因为它充分利用了区块链技术的去中心化协议与经济激励规则，通过分布式系统和程序，来保障元宇宙上活动的有序执行，与资产的抗审查确权。\n\n​        但是有人要问了：元宇宙里不管是从现实世界里采样的信息，还是直接在元宇宙里生成的信息，随着元宇宙的繁荣，就要生成现实世界方方面面的数字孪生；这对于区块链来讲，就是超多的交易，超大的数据，现在的区块链，或区块链技术（比如以太坊），能支撑的住吗？\n\n# 2. 元宇宙希望区块链提供哪些支撑？\n\n​        我们先来看看元宇宙当前主要的应用有哪些：\n\n1. 媒体舆情：像VeeR、斗鱼等主要是利用VR+5G的技术，把当下流行Web2的视频点播或VR游戏，简单搬移到了元宇宙上；倒是有个有趣的现象是视频网站从元宇宙的卡通人物里吸取灵感，给主播选换元宇宙头像，在Web2的视频网站上大受欢迎。\n2. 社交游戏：这个是最贴合元宇宙属性的场景，像腾讯就借微信、QQ的用户量在积极拓展元宇宙社交，而网易游戏、米哈游也从游戏角度纷纷杀入元宇宙。\n3. 电商会展：电商直播与电商税收成为国家整治对象，最近的疫情给会展业带来了重创，而元宇宙让电商会展看到新的契机，百度与华为都在这块有着积极的尝试。\n4. 教体文卫：这个也是元宇宙切入比较多的板块，像腾讯就联合敦煌打造元宇宙数字原生NFT，倡导元宇宙游赏敦煌石窟的游玩。\n5. 智能制造：就智能制造本身而言，它是独立的，但我们应该看到，像有些高级制造与高级维修，由于高端师傅的稀缺，因而对于分散的门店或工厂，具有远程指导与治理的真实需求，这个也是与元宇宙相契合的，但我个人只看到一些汽车的后端市场，会用到AR远程指导，还没有真正迁移到元宇宙。\n6. 政治军事：比较容易想到的利用元宇宙的3D仿真城市管理与实战演练了。\n7. 其他应用：除了以上6大类，目前对元宇宙有所涉略的还包括：数字金融、房地产、产业园和农业等。\n\n​        事实上，元宇宙所能涵盖的应用或业务，远不至这些，我们大可以从经济、社会、生产、科技、教育和生活诸多方面，展开极限想象：元宇宙里资源无限，因此人们只为快乐而干活；社会将由人治走向法治，再到数学治的转变；从此创意是唯一的技能，什么学这学那的，都不需要，只要保持创造性思维能力就掌握了生产力；在元宇宙的世界里，科技似乎真的有机会触达神灵，因为元宇宙里有不断自我演进的人类智慧；学习的精髓不再是记忆而是遗忘，因为元宇宙会随时帮您记忆，并修正你曾记错的地方；生活真得将变得如此简单，互联网给大家带来的便利有目共睹，元宇宙肯定将让我们世界变得更加方便、更加简单。\n\n​        天下没有免费的午餐，元宇宙是很美好，但它离不开科技，工程，以及底层各技术的框架的支撑。下面是赵国栋老师关于元宇宙的技术框架图：\n\n![图3 元宇宙技术框架图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dj8bYtFeMXlSkbvBCtmfW.png?height=538&width=1247)\n\n​        其中红框处的`去中心化层`就是我们这里所关心的区块链。虽然赵老师这个图很好地表述了元宇宙的架构，但没能清楚地表述区块链的组成，及其层次逻辑，所以我们更乐意用下面一张图来理解元宇宙中的区块链：\n\n![图4 自商业（BAO）区块链层次架构图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rHQGobOnEIbk36fXDlU2h.png?height=390&width=664)\n\n​        这张图是ENChain.Asia的朱峰在BAO的白皮书里第一次提出`自商业`的框架图，它与元宇宙Web3应用的自主经营比较吻合。但该图里还没有很好地体现Web3应用的业务。我们知道，Web3应用其实是由两部分组成的：\n\n1. 后端：也就是运行在区块链网络上的业务处理逻辑。\n2. 前端：也就是我们一般用户看到的Web页面等。\n\n![图5 区块链业务与区块链之间的层次关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7aALil7Ix8GlpuBmckluL.png?height=484&width=664)\n\n​        其中淡橙色部分组成了元宇宙Web3应用的业务部分。而后端我们把激励层、治理层、仲裁层和合规层理解为Web3应用在区块链上，基于智能合约的逻辑处理部分，同时，为了适应元宇宙`去中心化自主治理`的业务诉求，还整合进了`自商业` 的逻辑。\n\n​        另外，也有人把区块链比作元宇宙的粘合剂，通过把终端、云计算、AI、大数据与网络相关整合一起，为元宇宙的实现建立起底层的技术基础：\n\n![图6 区块链与元宇宙其它构件关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa9gDAW30NAGrpspG1NYT.png?height=542&width=634)\n\n​        通过上面4张图，我们大体可以理解区块在元宇宙体系里，所处的位置和大概作用。下面我们来进一步分析元宇宙，期望区块链可以提供哪些基础的功能，来支撑它重建一个新世界的远大目标。\n\n​        为了更好地分析，我们把元宇宙关于区块链的诉求，分成一般性需求，和特殊性需求来看。\n\n1. 一般性需求，也就是针对一般Web3应用就需要的。\n2. 特殊性需求，则是元宇宙具体特殊的需求。\n\n​        首先，跑在元宇宙的业务应用肯定也是Web3应用，因此我们可以看到元宇宙，会对区块链提出4类一般性需求：\n\n1. 一种自我激励可靠的去中心化网络，来承载元宇宙的业务。\n2. 一种共识可信的超级账本，来记录元宇宙中活动的点点滴滴。\n3. 一种分布式的不可篡改存储，来确保元宇宙数据的真实性。\n4. 一种基于智能合约的法则，来有效约束各参与方的行为规范。\n\n​        另外，元宇宙作为一个创造新世界的庞大复杂的系统，它应会考虑以下6点，区块链不能成为它的瓶颈：\n\n1. 要能支持几乎无限丰富的应用场景。\n2. 要能支持高并发的交易量。\n3. 要能支持大吞吐的数据量。\n4. 要能与现实世界流畅沟通。\n5. 要能确保隐私。\n6. 商业经营高度自治等。\n\n​        对于一般性需求而言，众所周知，正是区块链技术所擅长的；也正是因为区块链拥有了这些能力，也给了大家想象元宇宙的空间。但元宇宙反过来，则又对区块链提出了更高的要求。下面我们重点关注**区块链可不可能支撑元宇宙的这些更高要求**？\n\n# 3. 区块链能否撑起元宇宙？\n\n## 3.1 不可能三角原则\n\n​        在回答这个问题之前，我们先来认识一下区块链的不可能三角原则。因为它将是我们下面立论的基础。\n\n![图7 区块链不可能三角](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wdG-9nqL4w2qzDiIH-nX0.png?height=569&width=940)\n\n​        区块链不可能三角（blockchain trilemma）由以太链创始人Vitalik 提出：也就是说区块链技术不能同时实现去中心化性程度、安全性和高效性。其中：\n\n1. 去中心化是指拥有大量区块生产和验证的节点，一般节点越多，去中心化程度越高。\n2. 安全性是获得网络控制权所要花费的成本，通常在共识机制的设计中锚定现实世界的资产，例如工作量证明机制锚定的是算力。\n3. 高效性就是每秒处理交易的笔数。\n\n​        正是不可能三角原则，使得各种区块链的设计与实现中，只能三者舍其一：要么是确保资本安全，共识基础牢靠；要么是单位吞吐量大，交易费便宜；要么是数据存储技术出众，存储费低廉。这也就导致现在难有一条链，或一种链就可以支撑起元宇宙的特殊需求。\n\n## 3.2 各具特色的区块链\n\n### 3.2.1 大小王\n\n​       首先就是2008年由中本聪发布的`比特币`，它标识了区块链1.0的诞生，一举奠定了区块链的思想与关键技术，是名符其实的区块链大王。比特币带给我们的区块链特征包括：\n\n1. 以区块组成的链条存储交易信息或数据。\n2. 整个区块链网络所共识且共享的超级账本，确保账本的真实性。\n3. 应用了非对称加密算法，通过公钥与私钥结合的方式搭建了区块链的安全防御系统。\n4. 源代码公开，使得区块链网络中设定的共识机制、规则等都可以通过一致的、开源的源代码进行验证。\n5. 贯彻去中心化的思想，包括中本聪到底是何许人也，到现在也不知道（否则中本聪在区块链领域的话语权要比V神大）。\n6. P2P的分布式网络，区块链网络将是去中化的分布式网络。\n\n![图8 区块链分布式网络拓扑](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Nx2DtHYV6tFddTMbucZq.png?height=638&width=641)\n\n​        人们看到，比特币在不可能三角中，特别注重了`去中心化`与`安全`,所以它的TPS特别低，且延时长；而且它脚本类的链上程序不是图灵完备的。虽然区块链1.0比较好地解决了货币发行与支付的去中心化，但应用场景还是很受限。为此区块链的小王以太坊，由Vitalik Buterin于2013年创建，它标识着区块链2.0的诞生。\n\n​        `以太坊`在比特币的基础上，创建了一个图灵完备的虚拟机EVM。因此，人们可以在以太坊上编写智能合约；理论上，可以在该EVM上实现任何复杂的逻辑。为此，Ｖ神在以太坊诞生之初，喊出了以太坊要成为`世界计算机`的口号。\n\n![图9 以太坊基于智能合约的运行机制](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9KWA4oVRVdgjIE1bXSDgI.png?height=431&width=959)\n\n​        但是以太坊的设计虽然有不少创新，但终究是脱胎于比特币，还是过于关注货币的安全与去中心化，因此它的TPS也不高，而基于智能合约的旺盛业务需求，导致了时常区块爆炸和交易费高昂等诸多问题。\n\n​        不管怎样，由于多年下来，用户没有更好的选择，以太坊业已成为Web3应用开发的首选，和业界标杆。\n\n### 3.2.2 廉价的存储\n\n​        以太坊通过智能合约，解决了市场交易的去中心化。但对用户来讲，这些交易会伴随大量的数据，而且用户也会有需要数据确权存储的需求（这点在元宇宙里将会显得特别突出）。但对于以太坊这类区块链来讲，不是功能上实现不了，而是性能上难以满足：\n\n1. `$10000+/GB年`的费用，让一般用户无法接受。\n2. `13 x 6 = 78s`的延时，让音、视频实时播放类业务只能望而止步。\n\n​        为此，Filecoin与Arweave，抓住这个痛点，纷纷推出了自己的存储区块链，以及配套的服务。我们就以Filecoin为例，来看看它是如何实现高效的数据存储与访问的。\n\n![图10 IPFS/Filecoin数据存储](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WB0EKDJaGGSus0Sg44qwI.png?height=895&width=1600)\n\n​        Filecoin如上图所示，它其实是一个体系，基于区块链的技术，来支持可靠、快速，却又廉价的链上数据存储与访问服务。其中：\n\n1. 右下部分，它实现了Filecoin基础区块链部分：\n\n* 它是标准的P2P区块链网络，但该网络只是负责存储交易及FIL激励相关事务，并不存储用户数据（比如音、视频）；\n* 数据的存储是由该网络上的各个参与节点与用户达成数据存储与访问的deal(这个交易是要上FIlecoin区块链的)，再根据IPFS格式，在节点上封装扇区，并存储数据；但该节点要负责通过ZK技术生成PoRep和PoSt证明，交给Filecoin区块链网络共识。\n\n​        事实上，存储到Filecoin网络上速度也不快，它一般只会做48小时内完成承诺，而且允许超大数据量的存储在链下完成。所以Filecoin网络上的数据存储，也被称作冷存储。\n\n1. 顶上部分，它就是实现的星际文件系统IPFS，以便基于文件的内容，并支持大数据量的存储与访问：\n\n* IPFS也是个P2P的分布式网络，但并不是区块链，因此它上面的活动并不需要共识，只是利用了分布式网络冗余备份功能；\n* 所以IPFS又被称作热存储，在Filecoin体系被用作Cache技术；\n* 但缓存在内存空间不足时很容易被清除，这样会导致用户通过IPFS请求Filecoin的存储服务，很可能会在没有完成冷存储之前，就被清除了；因此在顶部右上角，又增加了一个IPFS PIN Service，来确保用户数据可以在IPFS这个分布式网络里保存足够长的时间。\n\n1. 另一个就是上图右边的`web3.storage`之类的网关服务了，它提供了RPC API，方便用户轻松访问Filecoin网络。\n\n​        可以看到，Filecoin在充分利用区块链技术的同时，还充分结合了链外的以下辅助技术，才得以实现便宜的、支持大吞吐的、安全可信的数据存储与访问的服务：\n\n1. 零知识证明；\n2. 分布式集群；\n3. SaaS网关等。\n\n​        通过Filecoin一组产品体系的设计，它可以在获取不可能三角的去中心化和安全基础上，还获得了链上数据大吞吐访问的高效性。当然，现在大家使用下来，感觉IPFS上数据下载还是慢，这个倒是应该通过增加IPFS集群的并发处理能力，以及Web3.Storage等API网关的网络带宽来解决。\n\n### 3.2.3 突破交易量的瓶颈\n\n​        继了解决大吞吐数据存储方案后，那再来看元宇宙关于支持交易高并发的诉求。我们都知道，比特币原始链和以太链的交易并发数并不多，时延反而长，交易费反而高：\n\n![表1 比特币与以太坊TPS等性能](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4jUkffUHKsGKaI7O5ok-6.png?height=292&width=1267)\n\n​        这些弱点，仅让以太坊或比特币来支持元宇宙是不可能的。也正是看到这些弱点，各Layer2扩容方案纷纷出台，或者有的链干脆另起炉灶，完全设计出一条独立的支持高交易量的链：\n\n1. Layer2 扩容方案：它的思想本质就是通过将交易的处理从Layer1的区块链，迁移到了被称Layer2层，并对该处理生成一个证明，而Layer1层只作关于该证明的验证；而验证证明的计算量小很多，从而可以大幅地降低Layer1层区块链的负荷，也就提升了整个区块链业务TPS；当然Layer2层还会用到Sequenser等排序与压缩技术，来进一步提高TPS；目前Layer2的扩容路线主要是Rollup，它能实现Layer1层1\\~2个数量级的扩容。\n\n![图11 Layer2扩容方案](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4JES24OdSA0OKMoR9DHFI.png?height=214&width=600)\n\n1. Layer1独立链交易量的极致突破：它直接让Layer1区块链本身拥有更高的TPS；它往往是以牺牲安全或去中心化来获取更高的单位时间交易量；其中典型的案例有Solana，它的设计中一个时间点只有一个Leader节点出块，而其它的节点只对块中的交易进行验证；因为它的出块，再不是区块链网络里所有节点竞争，所以它会快许多，但显然安全性会下降许多；为此Solana设计了随时间单向的PoH协议，以及TowerBFT协议等，来尽量弥补单个Leader出块中心化不安全的弱点；Solana的TPS可达5万+。\n\n![图12 Solana架构](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J9s2wlVpj7aqm2F7qR-7Y.png?height=713&width=1244)\n\n​          据Solana白皮书介绍，基于Solana链的交易量瓶颈不再在链本身，而在网络带宽。\n\n### 3.2.4 跨链\n\n​        从前面3个小节的分析，我们确实可以看到，区块链有的去中化程度高，安全可靠，有的可以突破TPS瓶颈，有的则可以很好满足便宜可信大数据量的存储。这些都是元宇宙所需要的。为此，除了独立区块链分布式网络相关的技术外，还需要相关跨链技术，把不同的区块链连接起来，促使它们之间货币信息的流通，甚至可以互操作。对应着这种技术的产品，被大家形象地称为跨链桥。\n\n​        V神把跨链技术的演进和实现方式，总结为3类：\n\n1. 哈希时间锁合约：通过一套密码学方法，来实现不同链上资产的交易；但只能是资产类交易，不能实现资产在不同链上流通，更不能互操作了；下面2张图就显示了基于哈希锁和时间锁，实现将比特币交换成以太的过程：\n\n![图13 存币上锁](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GHT0_1ieqENqiDYTSv4Vl.png?height=87&width=621)\n\n![图14 开锁取币](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HkZWHPwe6oruFM7Vxscat.png?height=76&width=600)\n\n1. 公证人机制：是由公证人建立一个中间账户，用户将资产转入中间账户，由公证人跨链发行一种映射原Token的影子Token给到用户；当用户需要赎回的时候，将影子Token销毁，并向公证人提供证明，公证人将中间账户的原始Token转到该用户的地址；基于公证人的方案，可以实现资产在不同链，或异构链上流通；但这个流通的可信度，是依赖于这个第三方公证人可信度的。\n2. 桥接链方案：它是当前主流的跨链技术；与公证人方案一样，仍然存在一个中间账户，但中间账户的安全，不靠公证人来保护，而是靠智能合约来规范，这意味着中间账户将是一个合约账户，其资产管理规则被智能合约的代码约束，而不是由公证人约束；如果代码本身没有问题，只要部署该合约的链是安全的，那么合约中的资产就是安全的；像波卡和Cosmos不仅要实现支持资产流通，甚至支持它们同构子链之间的互操作。\n\n​        要说明的一点是：桥接链应搭建在双图灵完备的链间，因为桥接链不是一个独立的存在，而需要部署在两端链上的合约配合，就像一座桥不能悬空存在，必须在两岸有桥墩作为依托一样。\n\n![图15 桥接链示意](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Syb4-mlnSJTO4nLF8Ytqb.png?height=312&width=604)\n\n​        而桥接链方案又可分成3个流派：\n\n1. 通用跨链派：它专注于跨链，旨在实现适配区块链领域存在的所有链，其典型代表是Polygon\n\n![图16 Polygon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ypmulFxPaLzQodIhTVLnq.png?height=328&width=602)\n\n​        上图中的蓝色图标就表示是Polygon。但细心的你会发现它是以`以太坊`为中心的。因为Polygon的目标是`实现一个以太坊兼容链的互联网`。但我们前面讨论了，在元宇宙里，除了以太坊，还需要有诸如Filecoin等的区块链网络；并且对于元宇宙业务应用来讲，尽管以太坊已成为许多人认可的`世界记账机`，也不一定就是中心（区块链应该排斥中心的）。\n\n1. 引流跨链派：它往往是Layer1的独立链，需要借用以太坊更丰富的货币体系，以及引流以太坊上大量的免教育用户，其典型代表有Solana Wormhole\n\n![图17 Solana Wormhole](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pjTsdcJKkZ28zPrfW1hZh.png?height=410&width=539)\n\n​        Wormhole在以太坊与Solana之间，搭建一条双向、去中心化的 ERC-20⇄SPL 代币桥。Solana主打的这条`trustless`桥，让以太坊的DeFi交易者和应用，在两条链上进行资产转换，并享受Solana的高TPS和低转账成本的服务；而且基于Wormhole，开发者可以继续使用之前为以太坊编写的智能合约。细心的你有可能发现上图左下角的`Terra`作为Luna的基础链，已经崩了；这里还选用这张图，主要是想警示大家，在通过跨链技术，连接不同区块链时，注意链想到之间产生`连环雪崩`灾害；这是元宇宙安全所在，由于安全问题不在是本篇文章的重点，就不展开了。\n\n1. 互操作跨链流派：它不仅要实现不同链之间代币的流通，更专注于链之间的`互操作`,链之间真正的互联互通，其典型代表有Polkadot最新发布的XCM\n\n![图18 波卡XCMP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a4hSares12VFUJ0EjIS4w.png?height=272&width=523)\n\n​        XCM是波卡的跨共识消息格式（Cross-Consensus Messaging format）的简称，XCM不仅支持链之间的通信，还支持智能合约、Dapp和Substrate pallet（模块）之间的通信，从而实现了不同链之间的消息传递，与类似RPC调用的互操作。但我们也应看到：XCM不能用于在系统之间实际“发送”任何消息，它的效用只在于表达接收者应该做什么；XCM是消息格式，需要搭配消息传递协议使用，才能完成消息的跨链。还有就是，XCM只适用于Polkadot家族中的平行链之间的跨链。\n\n​        通过上面的分析我们可以知道，由于不同链之间的共识机制，所有虚拟机和智能合约架构的不同，链之间的互联互通，还是有不少难度。但经过不同厂商的努力，我们也看到现在的跨链桥技术，已基本可以将不同的功能的区块链技术捏合在一起，来打破区块链的不可能三角，从而满足以元宇宙既要去中心化，又要安全，还要高效的诉求。\n\n​        另注：跨链桥这块，作者推荐大家关注Polkadot与Cosmos之类专注链互操作的区块链体系。因为它们理论上可以构建各种功能和特色的链，而且这些链在同一体系下，在设计之初，就充分考虑了跨链互联的需求。\n\n## 3.3 满足不可能三角之后呢？\n\n​        通过3.2节的分析，我们知道，基于跨链桥技术，可以将具有不同功能与特色的链连接起来，从而使得不可能三角的安全性、去中心化和高效性的三者兼得。但元宇宙的特殊需求尚不止于此。\n\n### 3.3.1 可用不可见的隐私计算\n\n​        元宇宙尽管是个虚拟世界，但其中还是关联到现实生活中的，会附带着各种数字资产，以及大量的个人隐私信息。所以在元宇宙里往往会采用DID（去中心化的身份证），来绑定用户在元宇宙里的身份，并进而把与之相关的资产和数据归之名下。\n\n​        这个小节我们主要谈谈用户链上数据隐私保护的问题。我们可以发现以下几点前提：\n\n1. 首先，这些数据要是为元宇宙所有用户认可的，所以数据就应存放在去中心化的区块链网络上，比如Filecoin。\n2. 为了保护隐私，这些数据应是加密存储，只有用户自身才能读取其中的内容。\n3. 但这些隐私数据如果元宇宙不能使用，那就无法提取该用户的相关属性，也难以为该用户提供更好的服务。\n\n![图19 元宇宙渔业监管](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1fQLBoiODE8PdrAiTGpVX.png?height=391&width=762)\n\n​        如上图，`元宇宙渔业监管部门`需要监查`元宇宙渔船`是否超出了捕捞海域，需要渔船的`元宇宙海域坐标`；渔船认为该坐标信息是它的隐私，不便提供；而监管部门没有坐标是没有办法监管。因此现实世界里，只能由监管部门强制收取，最后由于职权部门的泄密，导致个人安全或利益受损，个人往往也只能认倒霉。\n\n​        我们知道，数据的处理包括三个环节：传输、存储与计算。其中，传输、存储的安全已有相关技术，但数据的`安全计算`一直没有一条通用性的方案，也就是讲，现有的数据安全计算方案，往往只能应用于特定的场景。我们对数据安全计算的目标，主要定位在`数据可用不可见`上，所以又将数据安全计算，称为`隐私计算`。由于数据已成为最重要的生产资料，隐私计算将显得越来越重要。当前的主要的隐私计算技术分类有：\n\n![图20 隐私计算分类](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VboHK1kz7SirkXmQMJJID.png?height=241&width=1370)\n\n        基于以上分析，元宇宙也是需要隐私计算的技术，来确保用户隐私数据的`可用不可见`；而且为了节约网络带宽资源，实现的隐私计算功能模块，**应当贴近区块链端**。其中`零知识证明`技术，已在区块链里被广泛使用。前面我们提到过，像Filecoin里的PoRep与PoSt就利用了零知识证明。但这项技术只能证明数据存储行为本身，并不能从该数据里抽取有用的属性，比如渔船越界了。为此，在元宇宙里，还应充分利用`联邦学习`，`可信执行环境`等技术，并把它们有机结合起来：\n\n1. 搭建`联邦学习`等AI计算集群，提供支持保护隐私的神经网络训练与预判环境，为元宇宙提供类似人工智能感知层，但这个感知是去中心化的。\n2. 搭建可信执行环境，由于该环境需要支持AI的训练与计算，所以元宇宙里的可信执行环境是服务器集群级别，与手机和安全卡之类的可信执行环境，在物理上不是一个量级。\n\n​        其是在元宇宙里联邦学习集群与可信执行环境集群，可以合二为一，形成一种类似`PaaS`的服务。作者认为，这应该是元宇宙的一项基础构件，像元宇宙中社区自治（DAO）中，特别倚重的声誉系统，没有AI，没有确保隐私的AI，学习性、公正性、有效性就难以保证。想要建立元宇宙的良性生态，不妨先把这个基础服务做起来。如果您看好元宇宙，这将是一块真正的`busyness`。但目前似乎少有企业或组织，真正把它当作业务，或者以PaaS、BaaS的眼光来看待它。\n\n### 3.3.2 Oracle沟通物理世界\n\n​        通过3.3.1小节的讨论，我们通过采用多种隐私计算技术，可以保障元宇宙中用户个体数据的隐私安全。但如果区块链相以支撑起元宇宙，我们认为尚有不足，因为元宇宙不仅仅是现实世界的搬迁，它还需要与物理世界的交流与互动。像海尔在组建的元宇宙工厂，如不与现实工厂相关联，对海尔来讲是没有意义的。\n\n​        元宇宙与物理世界的交互，其实就是物理世界信息要更新到元宇宙的区块链网络中，而区块链网络处理的结果，应该反映到现实中去。这种交互，就需要所谓的Oracle技术（预言机）。该技术在DeFi里使用比较多，其中典型的代表就是Chainlink。\n\n![图21 Chainlink Oracle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i84z-1bztLjgvRtgBUsZe.png?height=365&width=591)\n\n​        它的工作机制是：\n\n```\n  1. Chainlink构成了一个去中心化的分布式网络，并通过Oracle合约与以太坊等区块链锚定。\n  2. 用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Adapter服务；该服务会从不物理信源处采集所需要的信息，比如各DEX关于LINK Token的价格，进行汇总，并根据用户的喜好采用这些信息，调用Oracle合约，自动触发相关的链上交易。\n  3. 链上的逻辑处理完好，又可以调用Oracle合约，将信息返回给Chainlink网络；用户可以在Chainlink网络上部署Initiator服务；该服务根据Oracle返回的信息，再触发现实世界的相关交易。\n```\n\n​        元宇宙与现实世界的沟通，也需要诸如Chainlink之类的Oracle技术：使得两个世界息息相生。\n\n### 3.3.3 DAO\n\n​        经过上面的分析，我们就来看看最后一个点：那就是元宇宙的商业自治。这个诉求与区块链的DAO是极其吻合的。\n\n![图22 DAO示意](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KTYENeIiMoYbUyLwoLgbR.png?height=402&width=601)\n\n​        DAO是指去中心化自治组织，它伴随区块链而诞生，并一经出现，就热度不减。因为它有以下鲜明的特点：\n\n1. 去中心化、自动化和透明，所有要遵守的规则都由链上公开的智能合约来定。\n2. 社区驱动，规则的决定与调整，也就是组织的决策权，赋予社区里所有的代币持有者，由大家投票裁决；往往这种权力是与社员持有代币量成正比；因而让社区成为利益休戚相关且真正民主。\n3. 具有潜在的投资回报，DAO中所持有的治理代币，正如初创公司早期持有的股权：后面一旦成功，这些代币会非常有价值。\n\n​        这里，我们应将DAO的治理代币，与区块链的原生代币区别开来。原生代币是区块链网络为了维护其网络生态繁荣的经济激励措施而发行，从某种意义上讲，是存在类似`货币超发`现象，或讲超前消费嫌疑。而DAO的治理代币，它应是绑定在社区实际的成长上的：只有社区有价值，它的治理代币才会有价值。当然，不可否认，DAO的治理代币也起着经济激励的基础作用，如第2章中的7层架构中的`激励层`所示，它将给予社区美好的预期，促进社区成员，为着共同的目标一起努力。这点是与元宇宙的自商业完全一致。\n\n​        但是，我们也要看到DAO的一个致命的弱点：什么事都要靠投票来决定。这样，当有问题时，特别是重大紧急问题时，也要通过投票解决？2016年以太坊的`The Dao`事故，仍然历历在目。以太坊的做法是人为干涉，但这又与去中心化思想相悖，从而为人所诟病，并由此导致了以太坊的硬分叉。所以，元宇宙在社区自治过程中，还应设计好此类事件的应对方案。\n\n# 4. 结论\n\n​        元宇宙还有很长的路要走，但它美好的前景，值得Facebook去投入，也值我们所有人去追寻。元宇宙少不了区块链，这点已为业界共识。同时，从上面的分析来看，通过组合不同的区块链，以及隐私计算等相关技术，是有机会支撑起元宇宙的各类应用，以及对大家对元宇宙未来的畅想。\n\n​        当然，区块链相关的技术还有待发展，这也何尝不是机会。作者认为，我们可以重点关注：\n\n1. 开放式的跨链桥技术，将元宇宙需要的各种链有机、灵活地连接起来。\n2. 集成联邦学习与可信执行环境集群的BaaS服务。\n3. 具有通识基础的元宇宙声誉系统，打造元宇宙的DAO，建立基于`数字治`的良序公约。", "timestamp": 1654770879, "digest": "hYOaJFFtLrlJ3_CSClzJo_hAwKYb9-6w6dwK1_WaLQM", "contributor": "0x8fB6C85590aC6fFd0Dc31A95800C084F2DaAb5fe"}

Peers can validate and synchronize over 10k transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second latency in Aptos today, and we’re already on our way to 100k+ TPS.**\n\n## Overview\n\nState synchronization (or state sync) is an important but often overlooked aspect of blockchain design. In this blogpost, we discuss the evolution of state sync at Aptos and present several key insights behind the design of the latest state sync protocol. We further explore how we recently increased state sync throughput by 10x, reduced latency by 3x, and are continuing to pave the way for faster, more efficient blockchain synchronization.\n\n## What is state sync?\n\nMost blockchains today are structured hierarchically, with a set of active validators at the heart of the network. The validators grow the blockchain by executing transactions, producing blocks and achieving consensus. The rest of the peers in the network (e.g., fullnodes and clients) replicate the blockchain data produced by the validators (e.g., blocks and transactions). State sync is the protocol that allows non-validator peers to distribute, verify and persist this blockchain data and ensures that all peers in the ecosystem are synchronized. See the diagram below for what this looks like at Aptos.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XesMBhS5rLVIiluTme0nlw.png)\n\nAptos Ecosystem (Overview)\n\n## Why does state sync matter?\n\nState sync is rarely mentioned when evaluating blockchains: it is often a footnote in a whitepaper dedicated to more interesting topics\\*. However, state sync has significant consequences on blockchain performance, security, and user experience. Consider the following:\n\n1.  **Time to finality and user experience:** When new transactions are executed by validators, state sync is responsible for propagating the data to peers and clients. If state sync is slow or unreliable, peers will perceive long transaction processing delays, artificially inflating the time to finality. This has a huge impact on user experience, e.g., decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and payment processing will all be much slower.\n2.  **Relationship with consensus:** Validators that crash or fall behind the rest of the validator set rely on state sync to bring them back up to speed (i.e., synchronize the latest blockchain state). If state sync cannot process transactions as quickly as they are executed by consensus, crashed validators will never be able to recover. Moreover, new validators will never be able to start participating in consensus (as they won’t ever catch up!) and fullnodes will never be able to sync to the latest state (they’ll continue to fall further behind!).\n3.  **Implications on decentralization**: Having a quick, efficient and scalable state sync protocol allows for: (i) faster rotations of an active validator set, as validators can move in and out of consensus more freely; (ii) more potential validators to choose from in the network; (iii) more fullnodes to come online quickly and without having to wait long periods of time; and (iv) lower resource requirements, increasing heterogeneity. All of these factors increase decentralization in the network and help to scale the blockchain in size and geography.\n4.  **Data correctness**: State sync is responsible for verifying the correctness of all blockchain data during synchronization. This prevents malicious peers and adversaries in the network from modifying, censoring or fabricating transaction data and presenting it as valid. If state sync fails to do this (or does it incorrectly), fullnodes and clients could be tricked into accepting invalid data and this would have devastating consequences on the network.\n\n## Reasoning about state sync\n\nTo better reason about state sync, we first introduce a generic model for blockchain execution. While this model targets the Aptos blockchain specifically, it can be generalized to others.\n\nWe model the Aptos blockchain as a simple versioned database, where at each version **V** there is a unique blockchain state **Sⱽ** containing all on-chain accounts and resources. A transaction **T** can be executed by the Aptos virtual machine (VM) on state **Sⱽ** to produce a state delta **Dᵀᵥ **representing all state modifications that would occur on **Sⱽ **should **T **be committed. When **Dᵀᵥ** is applied to **Sⱽ** (that is, we consider **T** committed), it results in a new version **V+1** and a new blockchain state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We refer to the very first blockchain state as the genesis state **S⁰**. The diagrams below show transaction execution and state delta application.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZwNwY2c1kg8mYrQ-pmHziA.png)\n\nTransaction Execution and State Delta Application (Model)\n\n## What are the goals?\n\nWith a generic model in place, we can now define several fundamental goals for state sync\\*\\*:\n\n1.  **High-throughput**: State sync should maximize the amount of transactions that can be synchronized by each peer per second. That is, maximize the rate of state transitions from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹** for each **T **committed by the validators. If throughput is low it increases syncing time and becomes a bottleneck for the network.\n2.  **Low latency**: State sync should minimize the time it takes up-to-date peers to synchronize new transactions committed by validators. That is, minimize the time it takes peers at **Sⱽ** to sync to **Sⱽ⁺¹**, for each **T** that is newly committed by the validators. This affects the overall time to finality perceived by clients.\n3.  **Fast bootstrapping time**: State sync should minimize the time it takes new (or crashed) peers to sync to the latest state of the blockchain. That is, minimize the time it takes to sync to **Sⱽ **(where **V** is the highest database version agreed by the validators) regardless of the peer’s current version **P** and state **Sᴾ**. This allows peers to perform useful work more quickly (e.g., respond to balance queries or validate transactions).\n4.  **Resistance to failures and malicious actors:** State sync should be resistant to failures (e.g., machine and network failures) and tolerate malicious actors in the network, including other peers. This means overcoming a wide-variety of attacks, e.g., fabricated transaction data, modified or replayed network messages, and [eclipse attacks](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin).\n5.  **Tolerant of resource constraints and heterogeneity:** State sync should tolerate resource constraints (e.g., CPU, memory and storage) and embrace heterogeneity. Given the nature of decentralized networks, peers will have access to different types of hardware and optimize for different goals. State sync should account for this.\n\n## The required building blocks\n\nWe next introduce a set of fundamental building blocks required to construct a state sync protocol. For the sake of brevity, we provide a summary of each building block below and defer the technical details to future work (each of these could be a blogpost, itself!):\n\n1.  **Persistent storage:** To persist data across machine crashes and failures (and enable data distribution to other peers!) we require that each peer has access to trusted persistent storage. At Aptos, we’re currently using [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) but are actively exploring other options.\n2.  **Verifiable blockchain data:** To prevent malicious actors from modifying blockchain data, we require data to be authenticated and verifiable. Specifically, we need to be able to prove: (i) every transaction **T** that has been executed and committed by validators; (ii) the order of every transaction **T** executed and committed by validators; and (iii) the resulting blockchain states **Sⱽ** after committing each transaction **T**. At Aptos, we achieve this by: (i) building [merkle trees](https://aptos.dev/basics/basics-merkle-proof/) over committed transactions and the resulting blockchain states; and (ii) having validators sign the merkle roots of these trees to authenticate them.\n3.  **A root of trust:** Given that Aptos supports dynamic validator sets (i.e., changes to validators at each epoch), peers need to be able to identify the current validator set from a verified history of the Aptos blockchain. We achieve this through: (i) a **genesis blob** authenticated by Aptos, which identifies the first validator set and initial blockchain state **S⁰**; and (ii) a **recent** **trusted waypoint** (e.g., a hash of the current validator set and blockchain state **Sⱽ**). Together, the genesis blob and waypoint form a root of trust allowing peers to synchronize the real Aptos blockchain and prevent attacks (e.g., [long-range attacks](https://dlt-repo.net/long-range-attack-in-proof-of-stake-pos-blockchains/)).\n\n## Achieving 1k TPS: A naive approach\n\nUsing the model and building blocks presented above, we can now illustrate a naive state sync protocol. This protocol is a simplification of the original protocol used by Aptos (i.e., `state sync v1`).\n\nThe protocol works as follows: (i) `Alice` (the syncing peer) identifies the highest local persisted blockchain version **V** and state **Sⱽ**. If none exists, `Alice` uses genesis, i.e., **S⁰**; (ii) `Alice` then randomly selects a peer, `Bob`, and requests any new sequential transactions that have been committed by the validators; (iii) if `Alice` receives a response from `Bob`, `Alice` will verify the new transactions (**T⁰ **to **Tᴺ**) and execute them to produce state delta’s (**D⁰ᵥ** to **Dᵀᵥ**₊ₙ); (iv) `Alice` will then apply the new state delta’s to storage along with the new transactions, updating the local state of the blockchain from **Sⱽ** to **Sⱽ⁺¹⁺ᴺ**. `Alice` repeats this loop indefinitely. Pseudocode for the protocol looks as follows:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BNHW7j2GMZYb9pGe1lFvgw.png)\n\nState Sync v1 (Pseudocode)\n\nWe implemented this protocol at Aptos, benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), and analyzed it. Some of the key observations we made were:\n\n1.  **Throughput is network latency bound**: This protocol achieves a maximum of `~1.2k TPS`. However, throughput is heavily affected by network latencies as `Alice` requests data sequentially and must wait for the peer to respond. Given that we’re seeing an average network round trip time (RTT) of `150ms` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), this is suboptimal.\n2.  **CPU is dominated by execution**: When `Alice` receives a new set of transactions to synchronize, we see that `55%` of the CPU time is spent executing the transactions and `40%` is spent verifying the data, applying the state deltas to storage and persisting the new transactions. The other `5%` is attributed to message handling, serialization and other tasks.\n3.  **Latency is high**: When running the network at maximum load, the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~900 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is primarily due to `Alice` randomly selecting peers when requesting data and not taking into account the network topology: peers that are closer to the validators will receive new transactions sooner.\n4.  **Bootstrapping is slow**: The protocol above requires `Alice` to replay and synchronize all transactions since genesis. If `Alice` is far behind the latest state, she must wait a long period of time before being able to do anything useful (this might take hours or even days!).\n5.  **Performance is easily manipulated**: The performance of this protocol is heavily influenced by malicious peers. As identified in 1 above, intentionally slow (or non-responsive) peers will force `Alice` to spend long periods of time waiting for data and not doing anything. Thus, significantly increasing synchronization time.\n6.  **Resource usage is high**: This protocol is expensive for all resource types: (i) CPU usage is high because `Alice` must re-execute all transactions; (ii) storage is high because `Alice` must store all transactions and blockchain states since genesis; and (iii) network usage is high because `Alice` must receive all transactions since genesis via the network. This automatically imposes high costs and resource requirements, reducing heterogeneity.\n7.  **Resources are wasted**: While `Alice` is synchronizing new data, peers in the network are also synchronizing from her. As the number of peers requesting data from `Alice` grows, there is an additional read load placed onto storage and CPU required to handle these requests. However, much of the computation that `Alice` performs to handle these requests is wasteful as peers are often requesting the same data.\n\n## Achieving 10k TPS: An optimized approach\n\nLooking at the naive protocol above, we can make a number of modifications to help address the limitations. First, we extend the protocol to support 2 additional modes of synchronization:\n\n1.  **State delta syncing**: Given that validators already execute transactions and attest to the resulting blockchain states through merkle proofs, peers can rely on the state deltas produced by the validators to skip transaction execution. This avoids: (i) the high cost of execution, reducing CPU time by about `55%`; and (ii) the need for an Aptos VM, greatly simplifying a delta syncing implementation. As a result, peers can now synchronize by downloading each transaction **T** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** and applying them to storage to produce the new state **Sⱽ⁺¹**. We note that this comes at the cost of increased network usage (by approx. `2.5x`).\n2.  **Blockchain snapshot syncing**: Given that validators attest to each blockchain state **Sⱽ**, we can further reduce bootstrapping time by allowing peers to download the latest blockchain state directly (instead of having to produce it using transactions or state deltas). This significantly reduces bootstrapping time and is a similar approach to [snap-sync](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/) in Ethereum. The trade-off is that peers will not store any transactions or blockchain states prior to **Sⱽ**.\n\nNext, we implement a number of general optimizations and additional features to help improve performance and scalability:\n\n1.  **Data prefetching**: To prevent network latencies from impacting throughput, we can perform data prefetching. Peers can prefetch transaction data (e.g., transactions and state deltas) from other peers before processing them, amortizing network latencies.\n2.  **Pipelined execution and storage**: To further increase syncing throughput, we can separate transaction execution from storage persistence and use pipelining: a commonly used [optimization in processor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-and-architecture-pipelining-set-1-execution-stages-and-throughput/) design. This allows a transaction **T²** to be executed while a transaction **T¹** and state delta **Dᵀᵥ** are concurrently persisted to storage.\n3.  **Peer monitoring and reputation:** To improve observability and better tolerate malicious peers, we can implement a peer monitoring service to: (i) monitor peers for malicious behaviors (e.g., transferring invalid data); (ii) identify metadata about each peer, such as a summary of all transaction data the peer has and their perceived distance from the validator set; and (iii) maintain a local score for each peer. This information can then be used to optimize peer selection when requesting new blockchain data.\n4.  **Data caching**: To reduce the read load on storage and prevent state sync from performing redundant computations as more and more peers synchronize, we can implement a data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory.\n5.  **Storage pruning:** To prevent storage from continuously growing over time (e.g., as more transactions are committed), we can also implement dynamic pruners to remove unnecessary transaction and blockchain data from storage, e.g., anything older than a few days, weeks or months, depending on the peer configuration.\n\nWe implemented these modifications and produced a new state sync protocol (i.e., `state sync v2`). We benchmarked it on [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) and observed:\n\n1.  **Throughput increased by 5x-10x**: When executing transactions, the protocol now achieves a maximum of `~4.5k TPS`, primarily as a result of pipelining and data prefetching (i.e., the protocol is now able to fully saturate the CPU). When synchronizing state deltas the protocol achieves well over `10K TPS`, a further result of avoiding transaction execution. In both cases, throughput is no longer affected by network latency.\n2.  **Latency was reduced by 3x**: While running the network at maximum load, we now see that the average latency for `Alice` to receive new transactions is `~300 ms` after they’ve been committed. This is due to data prefetching and more efficient peer selection: peers who are more responsive and closer to the validators are contacted more frequently.\n3.  **Bootstrapping is significantly faster**: Peers who use blockchain snapshot syncing are able to bootstrap much more quickly. Moreover, bootstrapping time is no longer affected by the length of the blockchain (i.e., the number of transactions), but rather the number of on-chain resources to synchronize. Currently in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), peers can bootstrap within minutes\\*\\*\\*.\n4.  **Resource requirements are reduced**: With multiple synchronization modes and storage pruning, resource requirements have been reduced. Moreover, there is now support for heterogeneity as peers have flexibility to select the syncing strategy. For example: (i) peers with limited CPU can skip transaction execution; (ii) peers with limited storage can configure the pruner to be aggressive; and (iii) peers that wish to get up-to-date quickly can perform blockchain snapshot syncing.\n5.  **Resources are more efficiently used**: When handling syncing requests from peers, we see a significantly reduced read load on storage and less wasted CPU. This is due to the new data cache that stores commonly requested data items and responses in memory. We also see that as the number of syncing peers grows in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/), the data cache becomes more efficient, e.g., with `20` syncing peers we see a cache hit rate of `70%-80%` per request. But, with `60` peers we see a cache hit rate of `93%-98%`. This comes at the cost of an additional `~150 MB` of RAM to maintain the cache.\n\n## 100k TPS and beyond?\n\nWhile we’ve already improved throughput by 10x and latency by 3x, we realize that there is still more to be done. Especially if we want to match [Block-STM](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/block-stm-how-we-execute-over-160k-transactions-per-second-on-the-aptos-blockchain-3b003657e4ba) and make *Aptos a Layer 1 for everyone*!\n\nSo, how are we going to get there? Well, we’ve already started on our next state sync goal: 100k+ TPS! Although, we’re planning to save the details for a future blogpost we did want to provide some hints to the very keen reader:\n\n1.  **Transaction** **batching**: Currently, Aptos treats every transaction as verifiable, i.e., the merkle proofs used to authenticate and verify data operate at the transaction granularity. This makes verification and storage incredibly expensive. One way to avoid this is to perform transaction batching, i.e., proofs over batches (or blocks!) of transactions.\n2.  **Network compression**: Network bandwidth often becomes a bottleneck in peer-to-peer networks and Aptos is no exception. Currently, the state sync prefetcher can fetch around `~45K TPS` in [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) before saturating bandwidth. This is an issue if we want to scale. Thankfully, we’ve already recognized that peers are distributing data using an inefficient serialization format and by using off the shelf compression we can reduce the amount of transmitted data by more than `10x`.\n3.  **Faster storage writes:** Currently, state sync throughput is bottlenecked by the time it takes to persist blockchain data to storage. We’re actively looking at different optimizations and improvements that we can make to remove this bottleneck, including: (i) more efficient data structures; (ii) more optimal storage configurations; and (iii) alternate storage engines.\n4.  **Parallel data processing**: Until now, we’ve required that state sync process data sequentially (e.g., handle transactions at sequentially increasing versions). However, there are a number of existing approaches that would allow us to avoid this requirement and exploit parallel data processing to significantly increase throughput, e.g., blockchain sharding!\n\nUntil next time!\n\n*If you are, like us, passionate about designing algorithms, putting them in practice, and making a real impact on the future of Web3, please reach out — we are *[*hiring*](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs/)* at Aptos.*\n\n\\*Like consensus :)\\\n\\*\\*We implicitly assume that state sync must synchronize the states of **all on-chain resources**. Partial syncing strategies (e.g., light-clients that target specific accounts) are out of scope and will be discussed in the future.\\\n\\*\\*\\*This metric should be taken with a heap of salt. The Aptos [devnet](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/) is wiped bi-weekly, so there is limited state to synchronize. More evaluation will be required on longer running networks (e.g., our incentivized [testnets](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-roadmap-209be695c77c)).\n", "timestamp": 1654770911, "digest": "Fdi_wegYZT0MUt8fntG9Qt2CG-vz1vUhRxD2hHA7oek", "contributor": "0xFb10343f72123446316eB9d89e020d143EcAaaaA"}

In fact, I think most people already have a high degree of emotional intelligence.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are held back from using their innate emotional intelligence by a collection of bad habits that get in the way.\n\nIf you’d like to improve your emotional intelligence, learn to identify these habits in your own life and work to eliminate them. I think you’ll find that your natural emotional intelligence is not far behind.\n\n1. Criticizing Others\n   Criticizing others is often an unconscious defense mechanism aimed at alleviating our own insecurities.\n\nWe’re all critical sometimes. And it’s not necessarily a bad thing — to think carefully and critically about the world around us is a vital skill. It helps us navigate the world and our relationships in an objective way.\n\nBut too much criticism — especially the habit of being critical of others — can lead to the opposite of objectivity: it can make us narrow-minded and blind, especially to ourselves.\n\nOne of the reasons it’s so easy to slip into habitually criticizing others is that it makes us feel good:\n\nWhen you point out to yourself that someone else is dumb, you’re also implying that you’re smart. And that feels good.\nWhen you criticize someone else for being naive, what you’re really doing is telling yourself that you’re sophisticated. And that feels good.\nWhen you silently chuckle to yourself about how terrible someone’s fashion sense is, you’re telling yourself how refined your own taste is. And that feels good.\nHelpful criticism is about making the world better. Unhelpful criticism is about making yourself feel better.\n\nWhile being critical might temporarily make you feel good about yourself, it usually makes you feel worse about yourself in the long-term.\n\nOn the other hand, emotionally intelligent and self-aware people understand that criticizing others is just a primitive defense mechanism. And that there are far better, more productive ways of dealing with our anxieties and insecurities.\n\nWithout knowing it, people who are constantly critical of others are really just trying to alleviate their own insecurities.\n\nUnderstand that criticism of others is a waste of time and energy because it’s all time and energy that’s not getting invested in improving yourself and the world around you.\n\n“Criticism of others is a form of self-commendation. We think we make the picture hang straight on our wall by telling our neighbors that all his pictures are crooked.”\n\n― Fulton J. Sheen\n\n1. Worrying About the Future\n   Worrying about the future means living in denial about the fundamentally uncertain nature of life.\n\nAs human beings we crave order and certainty. And for good reason: Our ancestors who were better at making their lives a little less uncertain probably survived longer than those who didn’t. We’re biologically motivated to reduce uncertainty.\n\nBut there’s a big difference between taking reasonable steps to reduce uncertainty and being so terrified by it that we delude ourselves into believing we can eliminate it altogether.\n\nAnd that’s what chronic worriers. They’re so afraid of uncertainty, and so unwilling to live with it, that they trick themselves into thinking they can make the future less uncertain — by thinking about it constantly!\n\nChronic worriers live under the illusion that thinking is always problem-solving and that planning always leads to greater levels of preparedness. But neither of those are true:\n\nJust because you’re thinking about a problem doesn’t mean you’re thinking about it productively.\nAnd just because you’re planning — running through countless hypothetical future scenarios — doesn’t mean you’re any better equipped to handle them. Often, you’re just making yourself feel more prepared.\nWorry gives you the illusion of certainty. But in the end, all it does is fragilize you.\n\nEmotionally intelligent people understand that life is inherently uncertain. And they understand that it’s better to face up to this reality clear-eyed than to live in denial about it.\n\nBecause when you stop beating yourself down with all the stress and anxiety that comes with chronic worry, you’d be surprised how much energy and enthusiasm returns to your life.\n\nWhen you stop insisting that the world act the way you want it to tomorrow, it becomes far easier to work with the world you’ve got today.\n\n“Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength.”\n\n― Corrie Ten Boom\n\n1. Ruminating on the Past\n   Ruminating on past mistakes is a misguided attempt at control.\n\nJust like we humans crave order and certainty, we also crave control. We’re obsessed with the idea that, with enough effort and perseverance, we can do or achieve anything.\n\nOf course, most people who get stuck ruminating endlessly on past mistakes and failures don’t actually believe that they can change the past. Instead, ruminating about the past gives them the illusion of control, however fleeting and temporary.\n\nWhen you’ve done something bad or made a mistake in the past, you naturally feel guilt and regret. Chronic ruminators develop the unconscious habit of constantly replaying past mistakes because it briefly gives them a feeling of control. And feeling in control helps distract from feeling helpless — which is what we really are when it comes to past mistakes.\n\nIn reality, no amount of rumination or analysis of your past mistakes will change what happened. Which means helplessness and powerlessness are inevitable.\n\nThis is a hard fact of life that emotionally intelligent people not only understand, but accept.\n\nIf you want to move on with your life instead of staying stuck in the past, you must accept the past for what it is—including feeling helpless.\n\nYou must give up the choice to endlessly revisit it, no matter how much it distracts you from your real pain — the pain of helplessness.\n\nWhen in doubt, take action in the present instead of dwelling on the past. Do something useful, right now, now matter how small — and resist the temptation to replay yet another scene from your past.\n\nDon’t give up control over your future by pretending you can control the past.\n\n“To think too much is a disease.”\n\n― Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\n1. Maintaining Unrealistic Expectations\n   Unrealistic expectations are a misguided attempt to control other people.\n\nJust like ruminating is an attempt to control the past and how we feel about it, maintaining unrealistic expectations is usually a subtle attempt to control other people.\n\nOf course, most people with unrealistic expectations don’t see it that way. You probably see your expectations of other people as a good thing: Having high expectations for people encourages them to grow and mature and become their best self!\n\nMaybe, but this is still a subtle form of control. You have an idea for what another person in your life should be or do or accomplish and your expectation is your way of trying to make it happen.\n\nBut what does it mean, exactly, to maintain an unrealistic expectation?\n\nSimply put, it means you spend time crafting stories in your head about what other people should do. And when they inevitably fail to live up to those standards, you reflexively compare reality to those expectations and feel frustrated and disappointed.\n\nAnd how do you respond to this frustration and disappointment? By creating even stronger and more elaborate expectations, because it makes you feel good and in control!\n\nLook, of course you care about the people in your life and want the best for them. And it pains you to see them hurting or struggling or suffering. So, when you create a story in your mind about them succeeding and doing better (i.e. an expectation) you feel a little better.\n\nThe problem is, you can’t actually control other people, even for the better. Not nearly as much as you would like, anyway. Which means you create a constant vicious cycle of sky-high hopes and grave disappointments and frustrations.\n\nWhat’s more, eventually your attempts at control begin to be felt by the people in your life and they become resentful. And if it goes on long enough, they may even act contrary to your expectations simply out of spite!\n\nThe solution is to let go of your expectations. Stop creating stories about what you want for other people. And instead, just be present for the person they are:\n\nValidate their current struggles instead of daydreaming about their future successes.\nSet real boundaries on their behavior instead of wishing for perfection.\nMeet them where they are instead of where you want them to be.\nHang on to your hopes but let go of your expectations.\n\n“He was swimming in a sea of other people’s expectations. Men had drowned in seas like that.”\n\n― Robert Jordan", "timestamp": 1654771503, "digest": "Xs8sUODUbrLN6RXf8VYOBYqvhJtDBZth_eJRCw1FlLs", "contributor": "0xd25891CfAF13C9Ca8a102709261Da2fFd0Fb0a1F"}

All fees, collected to a protocol, as well as any interest earned through staking USDN that serves as collateral on Tsunami will be distributed between **TSN** stakers.\n\n### Overall terms\n\nAs a crypto enthusiasts and investors, we highly appreciate fairness and transparency during token offerings. In line with our values, we’re offering **TSN** tokens under a ‘Fair Launch’ model. Fair launch means that any participants may participate in the even on equal terms. Tsunami have not attracted any VC capital and had no private round prior to ILO phase.\n\nFurthermore, Tsunami team has decided to ***lock ALL team tokens*** in contract, with a cliff period of 6 months and a vesting period of 24 months. This way, we minimize the possibility of downwards price pressure after launch. Additionally, in this bear market, we’ve decided to ***reduce initial price*** per token to 0.2 USDN which means an initial market cap of 200,000 USDN.\n\n### ILO Process\n\nInitial Liquidity Offering (ILO) - is a new fundraising mechanism through which many projects and startups raise funds by selling tokens on the DeFi based Decentralized Exchanges (DEX’s). During ILO, team will stake own capital to provide initial liquidity to DEX (Puzzle Swap) to bootstrap liquidity. All tokens will immediately be put to circulation, reducing the possibility of price manipulations by large holders.\n\nTo put things simply, we will create trading pair (liquidity pool) on Puzzle Swap, provide 60% of **TSN** total supply to liquidity pool, along with enough USDN to make **TSN** price on exchange 0.2 USDN.\n\nAfters this process, everyone will have a change to buy **TSN** at minimum price - no external manipulation is allowed. Of course, as per AMM formula - the more tokens get bought, the higher the price - so be quick and try to jump in as soon as possible! You may also sell your tokens as soon as you wish, all tokens are immediately fully liquid.\n\nAfter an ILO team may withdraw some liquidity from the pool to finance future development. Also note, that the airdrop to the testnet users will take place in 3 days after beginning of ILO.\n\nWe will announce an exact date of ILO later, after finishing Testnet phase.\n\n### ILO Platform\n\nOur strategic partner for ILO is [Puzzle Swap](https://puzzle.surf/). Puzzle Swap is the most innovative decentralized exchange on Waves, offering many features to make ILO successful.\n\nAfter an ILO team will concentrate all resources on moving on with project roadmap. This includes, most importantly, mainnet launch. After launching mainnet we will introduce staking, that will allow users to stake their **TSN** tokens and earn rewards.

This was a very cool exploration in digital production, and left us feeling like we had just been \"on set\" for one month:) I want to go through some of the details of the project in this article, as I think it will be interesting to those with eyes on the metaverse!\n\n## THE METAHUMAN\n\nOur drive to start this project actually emerged from an introduction to the Metahuman software for Unreal Engine 5. I had seen the amazing advances in Unreal Engine over the last few years, but could not convince myself to learn this beast of a program until I saw THE METAHUMANS. [Metahuman Creator](https://metahuman.unrealengine.com/) is a web app that allows you to create and customize an avatar. During this process, the app streams to you a video feed in order to avoid any client side render costs. When you are ready, you can export and load all the textures / models / shaders / blueprints for a functional metahuman in Unreal Engine.\n\nIt’s very mesmerizing to use this tool, blending between different faces and sculpting the face and textures to your taste. It’s really hard to look away from her, watching her animate shyly, looking at me, looking away…\n\n![Our attempt at recreating Kiki Yago](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XGvJwB99xKudY-U5pdinX.png?height=949&width=1471)\n\nWe did the first pass at recreating [Kiki Yago](https://www.instagram.com/xenofontova_dasha/) - we found this task quite challenging, as the tool always seemed to clamp the features we wanted to sculpt, for example we could not find a way to get the avatars eyes to be wider apart. Anyway, we sent this draft to Kiki and she said that it was cool but definitely did not look like her, and that she would give it a try.\n\n![Kiki's self exploration](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hgog_0pOJwUk4iYpT7z_q.png?height=672&width=1843)\n\nI was skeptical that it would be possible to create an avatar that looks like yourself, since we all have some sort of self perception deficiencies and biases… but I was proven wrong! Kiki’s versions capture the essence of her facial features way better than ours, even with our restrictions that she must be bald:)\n\nI am very curious now to create my own avatar, and think it could be a cool exercise in self perception for all of us, since it’s the first avatar creator that can actually photo-realistically look like you, but do you even think you look like you?:0\n\n## FACIAL CAPTURE\n\nThe goal was to get Kiki to sing and record her facial capture for the entire song, keeping in mind that Kiki was in Saint Petersburg / Russia , and we were in San Francisco / USA. We decided on using the [FaceCap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/face-cap-motion-capture/id1373155478) application, since our friend used it for her [Little Martian](https://www.littlemartians.world/) project and had promising results, and all it needed was an iPhone 10 or above! Kiki downloaded it on her iPhone, and could send us the FBX over telegram!\n\nIt’s amazing with the technologies that we have today and the power of virtual production, we were able to come up with a face capture solution that did not require any studio equipment or even being in the same country!\n\nKiki sent us some short initial test recordings, and we spent a few days struggling through the technical details of getting the animation to map to the Metahuman facial rig -- this was mostly due to the fact that it was our first time using Unreal Engine for.. anything, and also that Unreal Engine completely changed their animation retargeting system in UE5.\n\nHowever, thanks to watching this video, its beautiful elevator soundtrack, and the [FaceCap morph target re-mapping data](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbExnbUJBOV9KcEFLRGFadlZKN2lJSWt0QnR2UXxBQ3Jtc0trODRlRHZZdHNQdzVTM2hRS0xwS0p5VnhyNkRYX0NjTk5QYWxHeTUzRU4xT3M1MGd5d2pkazluZHlMUkhhX25FU0dzcGd3OVo2UGR0ekphS2JPZVpRdkxRYzc5WHhSWHNZZmNuaFpPQ1dGSmVJQ0lFaw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fdrive%2Ffolders%2F1YHd5_ASl-KAS2e_k9h-CIwXIkAUMtSM0%3Fusp%3Dsharing&v=xixo8ljv9_8) that the author generously shared, we were able to get an initial working demo!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xixo8ljv9_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xixo8ljv9_8)\n\n[https://codercat.tk/facecap_testing.mp4?autoplay=true&loop=true&controls=true](https://codercat.tk/facecap_testing.mp4?autoplay=true&loop=true&controls=true)\n\nThis was super promising! Meta Kiki was alive! But obviously there was a lot of work to be done on adjusting the remapping of FaceCap to Metahuman Rig, specifically in the mouth and jaw area.\n\nWe asked Kiki to send us the FaceCap FBX along with a recording of herself from a separate camera and a WAV file, on Telegram, our Remote Face Capture Studio. This was a complete picture of the data, so that we had reference videos while adjusting the Metahuman facial rig remapping, and reference audio for aligning the face capture to the main audio track.\n\n![Telegram, the Remote Face Capture Studio](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-OtogUwkbFNt_BhvRJdMs.png?height=591&width=884)\n\n![Quick sassy capture of Kiki ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z7diXiBgxCo0ICpzEO1di.jpg?height=473&width=1280)\n\nAfter we got a good pipeline going, we could focus on ways to improve the overall effect of the face capture. We found that eye acting and head rotations came across really well and was a good place to focus the performance efforts. It was also critical to over articulate words and press lips together, which was actually a difficult task for this song where Kiki is pushing her lyrical alliterations at 100 words/second:)\n\nKiki pushed forward on this, coming up with some crazy fast eye blinking action and creepy doll expressions. She split the song into 12 sections of around 20 seconds each, because we found that smaller recordings were much easier to process in Unreal Engine.\n\n## TO BE CONTINUED\n\nOnce we were confident in our Face Capture remote pipeline, we moved on to the environment design and visual effects! This is a big and slightly unrelated topic since most of this work was done in HoudiniFX -- so i’m going to split that into another article:) \n\n![MSPaint Concept Art](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CcybeAZmnYpnXVkr-mTd0.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe are really excited about this technology, and to take this whole experience to the next level. Since the metahumans are so realistic, we definitely need to put some work into the 3D environment, shader, and geometry styles that are harmonious. This will be an exploration that i’m very looking forward to, with some shorter concept video renders. \n\n<3 [CODERCAT](https://codercat.tk)", "timestamp": 1654771650, "digest": "sOdxVpJEcC3N_hlytcg6cg_ApjrfLTc2eOW_TU7rcKg", "contributor": "0xf366Febe12995E7980248430b49331c54447F438"}

In addition, we’ll be using [Chainlink Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF)](https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-functions-vrf-random-number-generation-rng-feature/) to introduce provably fair random elements into the Axie universe, starting first with Axie Origin Coins (AOC).\n\n**What is Chainlink?**\n\nChainlink is the market-leading decentralized oracle network providing **real-world data to smart contracts on any blockchain**. It allows dApps like Axie Infinity to consume data from outside the Blockchain, such as data from web APIs, premium data providers, IoT networks, enterprise backends, and more.\n\n**What is Axie Infinity?**\n\nAxies are fierce creatures that love to battle, build, and hunt for treasure!\n\n‌Players can build up a collection of Axies and use them across an ever expanding universe of games!\n\nAxie Infinity is currently the #1 game on Ethereum, with over 14,000 monthly on-chain users, and over 11,000 daily off-chain users.\n\nWe recently launched our[ native token, AXS](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/axs), which uses governance and fee sharing to align incentives between all members of the Axie ecosystem.\n\nWant to learn more? [Join Axie Discord](http://discord.gg/axie) to meet our amazing community!\n\n# Integration details\n\nAs the first step in our collaboration, Axie has integrated the [Chainlink ETH/USD Price Reference Data](https://feeds.chain.link/eth-usd) feed into our [marketplace](http://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/). This price feed serves as a very important exchange rate to ensure that marketplace users have accurate prices when making a purchasing and listing decision. In addition, mainstream users find USD price feeds more familiar so its important for adoption that we get this right.\n\nCurrently, we’re getting our price feeds from centralized servers which can go down and be disrupted. With Chainlink price feeds, we can ensure 100% uptime for our marketplace’s all-important ETH/USD price feed. We feel confident integrating this key exchange rate via Chainlink because it’s secured by a decentralized network of high-quality oracle nodes that provide accurate price data sourced from a variety of excellent off-chain data aggregators.\n\nIn addition, we’ll be using Chainlink VRF for the generation of Origin Axies from Axie Origin Coins (AOC)! The number of Origin Axies in the game is capped at 4088. Each time 5 AOC are burned, an Origin Axie is born with a chance of possessing[ Mystic parts.](https://medium.com/axie-infinity/mystic-axies-jewels-for-adigital-age-4dd1b599ca61) The chance of an Axie possessing Mystic parts when they’re born from AOC will soon rely on the VRF!\n\nThis is an incredibly important task considering the scarcity of Mystic Axies is central to their value. In fact, a Mystic Axie just sold for 300 ETH and the event was covered by [CoinTelegraph!](https://cointelegraph.com/news/300-eth-sale-caps-wild-week-for-axie-infinity) Talk about famous digital pets.\n\nWe selected Chainlink VRF because it provides a highly secure source of randomness that is permissionless and auditable on-chain by all users. This provides users with cryptographic proof that all random elements are provably fair, and cannot be manipulated by our team or any external entities.\n\n**The Future of Axie Infinity and Chainlink**\n\nOnce Ronin, our Ethereum sidechain, is live, we’ll explore integrating Chainlink VRF functionality into more Axie-related smart contracts.\n\nChainlink also makes a host of fun features possible because it provides access to any off-chain API. We believe we have only scratched the surface in how external data can be incorporated in Axie to enhance gameplay and the user experience.\n\nFinally, we’d like to formally invite the Chainlink Marines to start playing Axie! Special thanks to [@ChainlinkGod](https://twitter.com/ChainLinkGod) for his work educating us on the benefits of integrating Chainlink feeds into our ecosystem!", "timestamp": 1654771720, "digest": "il6rJ71QgZ265fXgFB94WGAUw7EJBhODLt5L2viw8lU", "contributor": "0xd25891CfAF13C9Ca8a102709261Da2fFd0Fb0a1F"}

[@Zoezoe888zoe](https://twitter.com/Zoezoe888zoe) [@WhoKnowsDAO](https://twitter.com/WhoKnowsDAO)\n\n本期文字稿精选了6个 Space 中的精彩提问。\n\n编辑：三斤妹妹、定慧\n\n## 什么是 Social Fi ？为什么要 Fi 化那些资产？是否是伪命题？\n\n**pengsong：**\n\nSocial fi 与 Web2 最大的不同是：\n\n能够定义你社交关系的价值，并将其资产化、金融化。\n\n并且对个人（地址）进行赋能。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n**socialfi= social+fi**，是由 defi 到 gamefi 再到 socialfi 逐步演进的。**social 所涉及的人的广泛程度是最大的。**\n\n我认为 socailfi 的本质是通过 web3 的理念改变以往社交产品中的价值分配，让 web2 里别扭的地方通过激励系统的重新调配，去高效地完成供给层和需求平台在 social 层面上的交易撮合。\n\n但我觉得 social fi 是不是伪命题还需要靠验证。\n\nsocialfi 是目前所有“xfi”中唯一没有杀手级应用的词。从17、18年的尝试至今都没有跑出来一个真正有PMF的产品，因此我认为它是一个待被定义的词，如果长时间不被定义，这个词就会慢慢死掉，换做其他。当然这个问题背后的根本还是 web3 是不是完全的fi。\n\n**林川：**\n\n**social fi 更合适的称呼应该为“web3社交平台”**，虽然目前没有一个确切的定义，但我可以讲讲它不是什么。\n\n首先 social fi 不是 web2 社交产品的简单复刻；其次也不是 social to earn。\n\nsocial to earn的 主要问题在于奖惩激励很难明确化，很难防止用户互刷，产品本身的定位也会模糊掉。\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\nSocialfi 的核心是fi，token 和 NFT 所提供的金融和资产的工具让 web3 的社交产品对于价值分配和冷启动方面有更多可用的东西，至于重构好的产品是什么样的，目前还看不清楚。\n\n一直拘泥于 x to earn 的模式里很难逃脱旁氏的魔咒。因为金融化未必能给到用户最想要的东西，用户追求的主要功能还是交友、date、沟通与链接，金钱的过分加持会让人贪婪，不管是对单纯的用户也好还是在app里以挣钱为目的的一部分人。\n\n## Web2 领域有哪些可以借鉴的地方？\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n首先需要去理清产品的定位，即“社交”指的是什么？\n\n社交本身是一个被宽泛使用的概念，实际上在产品定位的坐标轴上是有不同程度和不同定位的，按照关系链强弱和内容占比，可以分为：\n\n**1.通信通讯类**\n\n**2.交友匹配类** (dating app / social network）\n\n**3.UGC社区类产品**\n\n**4.社交媒体**\n\n四种的产品的形态、设计重点、交付给用户的核心价值不同。\n\nSocialfi 中 fi 的概念可能是指：\n\n我们如何通过 token 的模型&方式，去重新做社交中的用户激励与利益分配？\n\n利益分配不止赚钱，例如 Dating APP 的匹配。\n\n至于 socialfi 里面的去中心化比重有多少，我认为可能没有办法做到全部环节的去中心化。\n\n比如说账号的新旧数据是用户自有的，无论是自己发的 UGC 内容还是新产生的社交图谱、关系链中的数据用户都可以自由处理与转移，这是去中心化的体现。但是最后很多环节可能避免不了要中心化，比如对于传统社交媒体和社交软件来说，它的一些核心能力与价值是掌握在平台当中的。\n\n比如对于dating app 来说核心是匹配算法，用户之间的匹配很难做到去中心化，因为会导致社交效率极低下。所以社交追求的是两件事，一个是找到的用户质量足够高，另一个是匹配精准用户的效率足够高。\n\n结合上面两点来看，我认为web3如果要将 social 和 fi 结合好，**用户质量、用户获得感、用户参与感、用户对资产的拥有和处理，**这些更偏质量的东西可能是优化的重点，而一些本身特别追求用户连接效率的社交模式不太适合做区块链的改造。\n\n## 目前对Web2社交产品的批评集中在哪些方面？Web3用户期待什么样的新社交产品？\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n如果是复刻 Web2 的产品。本身没有太大意义，因为对于用户来说除了有 token 可以挣以外并没有特别的价值。\n\n**而 token 本身的金融属性提供了很好的项目初期冷启动工具**，对前期圈一波用户有很大的帮助。比如说 Open DAO 和礼物空投 group，很可惜这两个项目后面没有能让用户留下来的产品。\n\n我体验过很多复刻，但是效果都不好。\n\n我认为从产品开发的角度讲应当跳开已有概念框架的约束去思考目前web3用户群体最大的痛点是什么，再根据痛点去找合适的产品方向。至少我发现很多人体感 discord 难用，以及安全事件屡屡发生，是否可以开发出一款专门针对 web3 用户的类 discord 通讯工具去解决用户最大的痛点与需求？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前对 web2 社交产品的批评更多集中在中心化和数据资产的所有权上，在国内这个问题不是用户直接体验到的。\n\n对于 web3 产品的新需求大家集中在社群的交流和管理的需求层面，因为目前还是用 web2 的产品discord 和 telegram 来代替的，它们毕竟不是原生的 web3 产品，各自都有一些问题。因此新的 web3产品需要瞄准用户的新需求与痛点，我赞同麻辣烫老师的观点去做 discord 的替代品，是具有一定的前景的。\n\n**陈不斯：**\n\n1\\.针对麻辣烫老师提出的痛点问题，人是否真的需要单独的社交产品？\n\nNot Boring 认为NFT是一种新型社交网络，因此是否需要一个单独平台去服务和承载是一个值得探索的思考的问题。\n\n2\\.如果社交产品是成立的，同时web3的金融属性不可避免，是否可以考虑本身就有一些经济属性或者逐利属性的社交行为？参考web2产品里的社交行为去用token经济模型改造。\n\n3\\.如果web3的金融属性可以被抛弃，发展到了用户足够大、圈层足够广泛和多样的时候，是否会跟web2产品遵循同样的方法论？“为工具而来，为网络而留”\n\nweb3相比web2来说最大的优势是互通性，代表用户的安全、隐私问题，给予用户足够的自主权，但是整体上面临的最大问题还是没有找到核心痛点让用户有动力从web2社交产品迁移到web3中去。\n\n**wegger：**\n\n很多赛道都在做socialfi的产品，发现了有以下特点：\n\n1\\.有门槛，通过爱好或者资产进行过滤。人们会偏好于小众社交，对身份的认同感在小圈子里支撑起来。\n\n2\\.socialfi在隐私领域的运营场景。\n\n3\\.技术差距不大，更倾向于思维和圈子层次的小众化，往小而精的方向发展。\n\n**taosha：**\n\nMake sense的场景：用户的数据算有权。不用证明自己做了什么事情，直接在链上数据可以看到相关资质。\n\n在招聘场景里，文凭可以作为一个 soulbound token（灵魂绑定代币），并绑定在一个作为 soul 的 did 上，不管是做 web3 领英或相亲平台，都可以从 did 的 soulbound token 中读取到我对文凭获得证明。\n\n对于项目来说，web3最大的红利是拉新获客很简单。过去我们需要在抖音、百度上买广告，而现在可以去扫描谁持有 BAYC (无聊猿)，就知道他很有钱，可以给他的地址空投一个 NFT 推销产品。\n\n在链上target用户较为精准和方便，更好地服务用户。\n\n**zoey：**\n\n思考两个问题：为了什么要做？为了谁去做？\n\nweb3 的价值定义：\n\n**1.让价值回归个体**\n\n**2.增强每个个体之间的情感链接**\n\n**3.不被平台控制的个人身份**\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n在web3里个人身份在社区里获得的，因此产品经理需要有深入社群的心，理想的产品组来源于社区本身，在社区里迭代最小可行性产品的人。web3 产品不是一个竞争性的产品，也不具有排他性，非社区内的大 web3 的产品需要和社区内的产品无缝结合。\n\n## 协议 vs 应用，对两个不同方向有什么看法？\n\n**林川：**\n\n目前发展形态上是产品和协议之争。\n\n如果短期出现一个比较火的 web3 的社交产品做出圈的话，需要非常强的运营能力，单纯靠协议很难。长期看web3本身的基建更适合做重协议、轻应用的形态。\n\n大家更愿意接受社交关系和身份绑定，应用只调用社交关系，而不是到哪个产品都要再跑一遍社交关系。\n\n我长期更看好协议的发展，短期能出圈的可能还是重产品、重运营的一些社交应用。\n\n**taosha：**\n\n协议需要有用户共识，而 Social 更是直接对接终端用户\n\nSocial layer 的协议，应基于杀手级应用而诞生。\n\n因为协议是制定被大家所使用的规则，杀手级应用能为规则带来共识。\n\n特别是【社交图谱】，用户必须知道这个网友我是怎么认识的，就非常看重应用场景。所以如果要做社交图谱的协议，一定要从自带场景的 APP 起步。\n\n像 super connect 这样的项目没有这么做，我不是很能理解。\n\n**林川：**\n\nsuper connect 如果要出圈，应该会是各种想做社交的应用发现调用 super connect 这个协议会很方便，能给自己加一层社交关系，从而逐渐产生跟风效应火起来。\n\n**pengsong：**\n\n如何将 social 的记录从应用的中心化存储状态放上链，NFT可能是一个很好的选择。通过钱包地址中记录着社交关系的NFT 配合协议实现社交关系上链。\n\n但目前这个领域大家围绕 social 更多是 token 的这种经济设计，NFT 的底子比较薄弱，可能还需要半年一年的时间发展。\n\n思想转变：\n\n❌ Token 经济模型\n\n❌ 中心化数据库\n\n✅ NFT 关系网络\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n站在产业格局的角度，虽然区块链是“胖协议，瘦应用”\n\n但当A16z 对 web3 概念的炒作，其实这个概念背后蕴含着将 Web3 推广给更多用户的期待。\n\n更多的应用场景带来的不仅是对整个行业发展的促进，也意味着行业上下游的竞争。例如协议下场做应用，或应用上升做协议。\n\n因此未来可能是 **“胖协议，胖应用”** 的状态。\n\nSocial 协议提供的核心价值是什么？\n\n* 如果是数据（关系链、用户身份等），则会受应用层牵制，需要等待应用的发展与积累。难以像其它协议一样通过开发者快速迭代升级\n* 如果是技术，目前社交产品的开发门槛比较低，更看重运营，协议可能无法提供足够的价值。\n\n提升价值的建议：【数据】+【技术创新】+【增值服务】\n\n**麻辣烫：**\n\n## 如果是杀手级应用来开发协议的话，这个应用是否可能是由 Web2 的老家伙搞出来的？\n\n或者干脆是把 Web2 产品改造而来，例如马斯克改造推特的可能？\n\n如果说，推特能被马斯克私有化，不再服务于股东利益，通过把底层协议和用户关系贡献出来，将自己的平台价值颠覆掉，转型成一个社交公链，想象空间就太大了。\n\n而且对于web2巨头自我革命，恐怕只有马斯克有机会做到了\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\n反对，推特这样的巨鳄自我革命太难。\n\n更可能的路径是这样的：\n\n目前围绕各个公链，已经基于交易，形成了经济关系网络，而社区中空。\n\n（例如以太坊网络中60-70%的地址都在 Defi 热潮中参与了进来。但没有产品去承载这种社交关系）\n\n因此，围绕公链做社区才是方向。因为只要公链不死，关系网络就在。\n\n这是我看好的 Social fi 机会。\n\n**Eric：**\n\n看好 Web2 巨头带着自身存量转入 Web3\n\n因为网络效应太重，哪怕开发者达成共识追求理想，但难以与用户达成共识。\n\n可能只有用户的无感知迁移才行得通。\n\n**BillyWen：**\n\n曾经电报、电话时代，协议都是通的。例如你可以随时给美国朋友打电话。\n\nIM 即时通讯时代来临后，才出现应用层建墙圈用户，为了自身获利。\n\n目前 Web3 实现了货币和金融的无边界，相信未来的 web3 Social 一样没有边界。\n\n商业公司改革的确很困难，因为要追求利润。\n\n但未来10年如果有人站出来，做出了打破边界的 Social 变革，我相信他会被载入史册。\n\n**Beagle Dao：**\nWeb3 Social 有四个方面\n\n1. **基础设施、协议**\n   1. 例如 ENS 解决了钱包和名字的问题，通过 ENS 的身份社交，而非钱包地址。\n2. **社交凭证**\n   1. 例如 POAP，通过 NFT 证明你在哪里做过什么事\n3. **社交关系、社交图谱**\n4. **工具**\n   1. 【语音】例如：Clubhouse 、Twitter space\n   2. 【信息】例如：微信、邮件\n   3. 【内容】例如：推特、FB\n\n语音比较难做。\n\n信息类工具很多人在做，迁移成本高，平台不互动。\n\n可能需要大佬入场，强制或用更高的势能带动更多人加入\n\n因为 Web3 的社交关系都存在链上，所以不会像 Web2 那样重平台。\n\n更可能是共创式，每个人都做一点，拼成整个 Web3 社交的生态。\n\n观点：**Web3 社交会从B端生长出来。**\n\n对于C端而言，Web2 已经有足够好的产品了。\n\n更大的可能性是开发B端有普遍需求的工具&协议，因为B端自己懒的做而被广泛调用，因而普及。\n\n## Web2 是邪恶的吗？\n\n**Eric：**\n\n我并不认为web2 邪恶，至少有游戏规则\n\nweb2 榨取用户价值、用户体验受损的的矛盾会持续存在，但也与现在的资本市场玩法息息相关。例如开放平台都会缩回去，因为平台感觉自己把有价值的东西送出去，但却无法满足金主爸爸的期待。\n\n这种恶是人性的恶。只要 Web3 是人做的，我想一样会面对。\n\n**web3 的核心是改变价值体系，基于token 经济让系统中的各个角色都开心。**\n\n但从金融层面，怎么玩都是零和游戏。打破很难。\n\n**陈不撕：**\n\n区块链不能解决人性的问题，从终局来看我会悲观，未来可能会出来新的不正义和垄断。\n\n而此刻他正在追求更公平，找到新的解决方案，这是我欣赏的。\n\n**Pengsong：**\n\nWeb3 的社交可能会更邪恶。\n\n当一个人的身份可以被 NFT 等链上方式充分定义，很多社交圈层将很容易通过技术建立门槛。你可能无法再通过找关系就加入一个大佬们会讨论问题的微信群、获得资源。可能因为你没进圈子，连吃瓜的资格都没有。\n\n但相应的，web2 当中很难走上颠覆（头部效应），在web3当中，你的努力更容易实现成功。\n\n**Red_Phoenix:**\n\n任何一个行业都有其宿命，都有其黑暗和光明。\n\n例如 Web2 的公司就一定会走向垄断和盈利，**而 Social 在 Web3 中的使命，可能是构建一个国家**，有自己共识、金融和分配方式。特别是当区块链的信用、生产力与线下产生链接时，就非常有想象力。\n\n——————————————\n\nWhoKnows DAO 将持续为大家组织优质的 Space、专题研究活动。\n\n如果你希望基于 Social fi

{"id": "LaWmTFChk4YJYRlpEDg9c_OYjqtQQqwXFu9oAJgI0P8", "title": "20 Things Most People Learn Too Late In Life", "body": "Life is a journey of twists and turns, peaks and valleys, mountains to climb and oceans to explore.\n\nGood times and bad times. Happy times and sad times.\n\nBut always, life is a movement forward.\nNo matter where you are on the journey, in some way, you are continuing on — and that’s what makes it so magnificent. One day, you’re questioning what on earth will ever make you feel happy and fulfilled. And the next, you’re perfectly in flow, writing the most important book of your entire career.\n\nWhat nobody ever tells you, though, when you are a wide-eyed child, are all the little things that come along with “growing up.”\n\n1. Most people are scared of using their imagination.\n   They’ve disconnected with their inner child.\n\nThey don’t feel they are “creative.”\n\nThey like things “just the way they are.”\n\n1. Your dream doesn’t really matter to anyone else.\n   Some people might take interest. Some may support you in your quest. But at the end of the day, nobody cares, or will ever care about your dream as much as you.\n2. Friends are relative to where you are in your life.\n   Most friends only stay for a period of time — usually in reference to your current interest. But when you move on, or your priorities change, so too do the majority of your friends.\n3. Your potential increases with age.\n   As people get older, they tend to think that they can do less and less — when in reality, they should be able to do more and more, because they have had time to soak up more knowledge. Being great at something is a daily habit. You aren’t just “born” that way.\n4. Spontaneity is the sister of creativity.\n   If all you do is follow the exact same routine every day, you will never leave yourself open to moments of sudden discovery. Do you remember how spontaneous you were as a child? Anything could happen, at any moment!\n5. You forget the value of “touch” later on.\n   When was the last time you played in the rain?\n\nWhen was the last time you sat on a sidewalk and looked closely at the cracks, the rocks, the dirt, the one weed growing between the concrete and the grass nearby.\n\nDo that again.\n\nYou will feel so connected to the playfulness of life.\n\n1. Most people don’t do what they love.\n   It’s true.\n\nThe “masses” are not the ones who live the lives they dreamed of living. And the reason is because they didn’t fight hard enough. They didn’t make it happen for themselves. And the older you get, and the more you look around, the easier it becomes to believe that you’ll end up the same.\n\nDon’t fall for the trap.\n\n1. Many stop reading after college.\n   Ask anyone you know the last good book they read, and I’ll bet most of them respond with, “Wow, I haven’t read a book in a long time.”\n2. People talk more than they listen.\n   There is nothing more ridiculous to me than hearing two people talk “at” each other, neither one listening, but waiting for the other person to stop talking so they can start up again.\n3. Creativity takes practice.\n   It’s funny how much we as a society praise and value creativity, and yet seem to do as much as we can to prohibit and control creative expression unless it is in some way profitable.\n\nIf you want to keep your creative muscle pumped and active, you have to practice it on your own.\n\n1. “Success” is a relative term.\n   As kids, we’re taught to “reach for success.”\n\nWhat does that really mean? Success to one person could mean the opposite for someone else.\n\nDefine your own Success.\n\n1. You can’t change your parents.\n   A sad and difficult truth to face as you get older: You can’t change your parents.\n\nThey are who they are.\n\nWhether they approve of what you do or not, at some point, no longer matters. Love them for bringing you into this world, and leave the rest at the door.\n\n1. The only person you have to face in the morning is yourself.\n   When you’re younger, it feels like you have to please the entire world.\n\nYou don’t.\n\nDo what makes you happy, and create the life you want to live for yourself. You’ll see someone you truly love staring back at you every morning if you can do that.\n\n1. Nothing feels as good as something you do from the heart.\n   No amount of money or achievement or external validation will ever take the place of what you do out of pure love.\n\nFollow your heart, and the rest will follow.\n\n1. Your potential is directly correlated to how well you know yourself.\n   Those who know themselves and maximize their strengths are the ones who go where they want to go.\n\nThose who don’t know themselves, and avoid the hard work of looking inward, live life by default. They lack the ability to create for themselves their own future.\n\n1. Everyone who doubts you will always come back around.\n   That kid who used to bully you will come asking for a job.\n\nThe girl who didn’t want to date you will call you back once she sees where you’re headed. It always happens that way.\n\nJust focus on you, stay true to what you believe in, and all the doubters will eventually come asking for help.\n\n1. You are a reflection of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\n   Nobody creates themselves, by themselves.\n\nWe are all mirror images, sculpted through the reflections we see in other people. This isn’t a game you play by yourself. Work to be surrounded by those you wish to be like, and in time, you too will carry the very things you admire in them.\n\n1. Beliefs are relative to what you pursue.\n   Wherever you are in life, and based on who is around you, and based on your current aspirations, those are the things that shape your beliefs.\n\nNobody explains, though, that “beliefs” then are not “fixed.” There is no “right and wrong.” It is all relative.\n\nFind what works for you.\n\n1. Anything can be a vice.\n   Be wary.\n\nAgain, there is no “right” and “wrong” as you get older. A coping mechanism to one could be a way to relax on a Sunday to another. Just remain aware of your habits and how you spend your time, and what habits start to increase in frequency — and then question where they are coming from in you and why you feel compelled to repeat them.\n\nNever mistakes, always lessons.\n\nAs I said, know yourself.\n\n1. Your purpose is to be YOU.\n   What is the meaning of life?\n\nTo be you, all of you, always, in everything you do — whatever that means to you. You are your own creator. You are your own evolving masterpiece.\n\nGrowing up is the realization that you are both the sculpture and the sculptor, the painter and the portrait.

{"id": "2mutPMqT0IjW4WDiZvkPXvxgCOT4lUMAL6qRINa3ma0", "title": "How I replicated an $86 million project in 57 lines of code\n", "body": "## When an experiment with existing open source technology does a “good enough” job\n\n \n The Victoria Police are the primary law enforcement agency of Victoria, Australia. With over 16,000 vehicles stolen in Victoria this past year — at a cost of about $170 million — the police department is experimenting with a variety of technology-driven solutions to crackdown on car theft. They call this system BlueNet.\n\nTo help prevent fraudulent sales of stolen vehicles, there is already a VicRoads [web-based service](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/registration/buy-sell-or-transfer-a-vehicle/buy-a-vehicle/check-vehicle-registration/vehicle-registration-enquiry) for checking the status of vehicle registrations. The department has also invested in a stationary license plate scanner — a fixed tripod camera which scans passing traffic to automatically identify stolen vehicles.\n\nDon’t ask me why, but one afternoon I had the desire to prototype a vehicle-mounted license plate scanner that would automatically notify you if a vehicle had been stolen or was unregistered. Understanding that these individual components existed, I wondered how difficult it would be to wire them together.\n\nBut it was after a bit of googling that I discovered the Victoria Police had recently undergone a trial of a similar device, and the estimated cost of roll out was somewhere in the vicinity of $86,000,000. One astute commenter pointed out that the $86M cost to fit out 220 vehicles comes in at a rather thirsty **$390,909 per vehicle**.\n\nSurely we can do a bit better than that.\n\n# The Success Criteria\n\nBefore getting started, I outlined a few key requirements for product design.\n\n## Requirement #1: The image processing must be performed locally\n\nStreaming live video to a central processing warehouse seemed the least efficient approach to solving this problem. Besides the whopping bill for data traffic, you’re also introducing network latency into a process which may already be quite slow.\n\nAlthough a centralized machine learning algorithm is only going to get more accurate over time, I wanted to learn if an local on-device implementation would be “good enough”.\n\n## Requirement #2: It must work with low quality images\n\nSince I don’t have a Raspberry Pi camera or USB webcam, so I’ll be using dashcam footage — it’s readily available and an ideal source of sample data. As an added bonus, dashcam video represents the overall quality of footage you’d expect from vehicle mounted cameras.\n\n## Requirement #3: It needs to be built using open source technology\n\nRelying upon a proprietary software means you’ll get stung every time you request a change or enhancement — and the stinging will continue for every request made thereafter. Using open source technology is a no-brainer.\n\n# My solution\n\nAt a high level, my solution takes an image from a dashcam video, pumps it through an open source license plate recognition system installed locally on the device, queries the registration check service, and then returns the results for display.\n\nThe data returned to the device installed in the law enforcement vehicle includes the vehicle’s make and model (which it only uses to verify whether the plates have been stolen), the registration status, and any notifications of the vehicle being reported stolen.\n\nIf that sounds rather simple, it’s because it really is. For example, the image processing can all be handled by the *openalpr* library.\n\nThis is really all that’s involved to recognize the characters on a license plate:\n\nI must say I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI expected the open source license plate recognition to be pretty rubbish. Additionally, the image recognition algorithms are probably not optimised for Australian license plates.\n\nThe solution was able to recognise license plates in a wide field of view.Although, the solution would occasionally have issues with particular letters.\n\n \n But … the solution would eventually get them correct.\n\n \n As you can see in the above two images, processing the image a couple of frames later jumped from a confidence rating of 87% to a hair over 91%.\n\nI’m confident, pardon the pun, that the accuracy could be improved by increasing the sample rate, and then sorting by the highest confidence rating. Alternatively a threshold could be set that only accepts a confidence of greater than 90% before going on to validate the registration number.\n\nThose are very straight forward code-first fixes, and don’t preclude the training of the license plate recognition software with a local data set.\n\n## The $86,000,000 Question\n\nTo be fair, I have absolutely no clue what the $86M figure includes — nor can I speak to the accuracy of my open source tool with no localized training vs. the pilot BlueNet system.\n\nI would expect part of that budget includes the replacement of several legacy databases and software applications to support the high frequency, low latency querying of license plates several times per second, per vehicle.\n\nOn the other hand, the cost of \\~$391k per vehicle seems pretty rich — especially if the BlueNet isn’t particularly accurate and there are no large scale IT projects to decommission or upgrade dependent systems.\n\n## Future Applications\n\nWhile it’s easy to get caught up in the Orwellian nature of an “always on” network of license plate snitchers, there are many positive applications of this technology. Imagine a passive system scanning fellow motorists for an abductors car that automatically alerts authorities and family members to their current location and direction.\n\nTeslas vehicles are already brimming with cameras and sensors with the ability to receive OTA updates — imagine turning these into a fleet of virtual good samaritans. Ubers and Lyft drivers could also be outfitted with these devices to dramatically increase the coverage area.\n\nUsing open source technology and existing components, it seems possible to offer a solution that provides a much higher rate of return — for an investment much less than $86M.", "timestamp": 1654772697, "digest": "3tEFDlgX4y5js5Pu8pDCPBTODxICvFWHhZXyz-8sD_c", "contributor": "0x5C29e2143A07f0B20a5881e1A353F95140c73D83"}

{"id": "1h_eEeU2M7Tuln1_pJ-vokb-p7xnh3G3tYCA6wGrnF8", "title": "2022交互指南(更新至20220609)", "body": "![head](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ICBCuq-KMqP3owGdSoAeT.png?height=200&width=600)\n\n## 前言\n\n先给大家讲一下我写这篇文章的心路历程和初衷，如果觉得废话或是说理念不一致的就直接跳过看项目或者无视吧，我也不是什么大佬，主要就是把自己这么长时间做过的事情整理了出来，$ENS、$DYDX、$GAL、$OP、$HOP这些我也有幸拿到。这里说一下我个人其实最多交互不超过5个号，大部分项目不超过3个甚至主要的就1个，这种确实不可能一波暴富，但我更喜欢真实去体验一些生态项目而不是单纯做交互撸空投，多个号刚开始主要目的也是希望把资金分开不想放在一个钱包，希望把号的质量做起来，再者动不动几十上百个我精力也顶不住，曾经撸交互也学习过一些类似脚本模拟操作、web3js批量自动化合约调用，但个人精力实在是不足，有时候还挺枯燥的，我也建议大部分朋友从做一个精品号开始，贪多嚼不烂而且现在空投标准也提高了，十个白号加起来有时候还没一个精品号数量多。这里就是希望将一些自己的经验分享给大家，还希望多多包涵。我在整个加密圈前前后后断断续续其实也有4、5年了，但前半段时间其实对于很多事情的认识和认知都不到位，直到后来下定决心把大部分精力都放在这里面之后才慢慢的接触感受到了这里面的魅力。\n\n早期我也是一个在交易所里面跟着单纯就炒币、没事在社群里刷刷消息冒冒泡的小韭菜(虽然现在也是)，那个时候也不知道为什么要去投资一个项目，每天眼里只有涨跌币价甚至连很多技术分析的东西也不懂，就这么玩了一年多。在这个过程中我发现，单纯用自己的本金去做这些投资但是恰巧由于各种因素或者自己投资策略有问题选被套住了之后会无从下手又焦虑，这种等待上涨的时间过于漫长，逐渐失去对一些事物的热情，这也是让我和看项目、做交互这件事结下缘分的根本原因。后来决定改变这种现状，尝试着慢慢接触这些项目和这些生态，从公链到DEFI、从DEFI到Gamefi、从Gamefi到NFT、IDO，每天都在看文章逛推特，说实话有点上头，但每天都知道还远远不够。\n\n本身资金量足够并且有丰富投资经验的大佬除外，像我这种自身资金实力和投资经验都薄弱的人我认为是不少的，并且进来币圈的目的也都一定是赚钱。起初反正投资的东西都被套了，大部分时间我的精力都在做一些项目的小活动、测试网上面，毕竟没本金也能理解，说实话现在时间多偶尔我也会去做一做测试网，但是刚开始什么什么项目都做，光做测试网的Excel就记录了好几百行，算了一算到现在也没多少收益，但这个过程对我产生的影响是最深的，因为没有资金或者是长期在交易所做交易的那种思想，导致在链上体验生态主网的时候刚开始连每次交互合约要手续费我都掐着指头花，测试网倒是给了我无拘无束的机会。\n\n后来行情回暖，被套住的币解套还赚了钱，运气倒是不错，慢慢地也从测试网走向了主网，最开始仅仅是在主网使用一些产品，是真的需要用才会去找对应的产品，这个时候我已经把一部分资金从交易所抽到了链上，说实话还真得感谢heco和bsc，由于手续费便宜我早期大部分链上操作都是在这两条链，积累了不少经验，但也没少挨上面土狗的打。发现对于一些新项目新事物的都有了自己的看法，在进行一些投资的时候也能自己分析出一些说服自己的理由(无关对错)，思路清晰了很多，投资有胜有负但胜率提高了很多，渐渐的才意识到其实是自己在早期亲身去接触分析体验了那一些项目，并且接触得越多对整个产品的判断虽然不说绝对正确但能降低出错的概率，这也是为什么我将交互这件事一直坚持下来也希望分享给大家的原因，我希望更多的朋友可以对自己所做的事情具备自己的判断和了解而不是摸黑。\n\n最近我还喜欢上看何币大哥在推特骂人，何大哥挺有趣但又真的无奈，这个圈子给我最大的感受就是有很多愿意分享的人，是真的希望带动圈子往前走的那种。但也无奈有只会伸手的人存在。我也喜欢和每个不同的有自己见解的人交流讨论，什么东西都只会问的那就各自安好吧。\n\n## 整体脉络\n\n下面我会将我交互表单中的项目筛选出来整理好，从不同维度归类也方便大家了解不同链上的各种交互项目。这里声明一下，第一我不会写太详细的交互教程，很多项目怎么交互老玩家都有自己的一套标准，现在本身空投标准就提高了大家都一样反而没什么收益，实在摸不到门路就去自己找教程吧，推特和Mirror上都挺多；第二我整理出来的项目也仅仅是我做过的项目，我不会面面俱到并且也有自己的一些评判标准，这篇文章主要是给大家一个参考性，也不构成任何投资建议，有帮助最好没帮助那也感谢大家花了时间看(抱拳)。\n\n这里我优先以各条链归类，信息会尽量保证正确，不过难免有漏缺，大家自己也可以查资料核实一下，坐稳开始。\n\n## 一、Polygon\n\n有很多项目早期在Polygon生态上，后期支持L2，建议有条件的在做L2的时候也交互一下。\n\n### 1.Slingshot（原DEX.AG）\n\n[https://twitter.com/SlingshotCrypto](https://twitter.com/SlingshotCrypto)\n\nPolygon、Arbitrum、Optimism 等 Web3 交易平台 - 连接钱包，开始交易。\n\n融资信息：\n\n* 种子轮(2020.10) $3.1M： **Framework Ventures**领投，Electric Capital、IDEO CoLab、**Coinbase Ventures**、Winklevoss Capital、Digital Currency Group、Robot Ventures、Digital Currency Group参投。\n* A轮(2021.12) $15M：Ribbit Capital领投，K5 Global、Shrug Capital、The Chainsmokers、歌手Jason Derulo、瑞士企业家Guillaume Pousaz和媒体公司Morning Brew联合创始人Austin Rief、Electric Capital、Framework Ventures参投。\n\n交互点：\n\n* SWAP\n* NFT SHOP交易(这块可以关注下创世NFT 若空投可能会有权重占比)\n* 设置用户信息\n* 体验聊天室(每次交互的时候顺便吹个水)\n\n支持生态：Polygon、Arbitrum、Optimism，这里我放在Polygon上是因为最初在Polygon做的交互，这边大家刷ARB和OP的时候也可以顺便交互一下。\n\n[https://app.slingshot.finance/](https://app.slingshot.finance/)\n\n### 2.Clipper\n\n[https://twitter.com/Clipper_DEX](https://twitter.com/Clipper_DEX)\n\nClipper 是去中心化交易所 (DEX)，旨在为白手起家的加密货币交易者提供小额交易（< 10,000 美元）的最佳价格。以 Clipper 为向导，在 DeFi 的波涛汹涌的大海中航行。\n\n融资信息：\n\n* 股权融资(2021.7) $4M： **Polychain Capital**领投，0x Labs、1inch、DeFi Alliance和Quantstamp等参投。\n* 流动性融资(2021.7) $17M：**Polychain Capital**、Nascent、LD Capital、Three Arrows Capital、Electric Capital、IOSG向Clipper的流动性池提供1700万美元。\n\n交互点：\n\n* SWAP\n* 提供流动性\n* 最新海盗船活动(22.5.9)\n\n支持生态：Ethereum、Optimism、Polygon、Moonbeam，这里放在Polygon的理由同上Slingshot。\n\n[https://clipper.exchange/](https://clipper.exchange/)\n\n### 3.

LayerZero\n\n[https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs](https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs)\n\n通过LayerZero协议，开发者五需依赖中间者，就可以搭建跨任何链的智能合约，使它们在多条链之间方便安全地互通信息。这里所指的信息范围很大，常说的跨链转移token只是跨链通信一个应用场景。\n\n融资信息：\n\n* 种子 $2M\n* A轮(2021.4) $6M：Multicoin(原Anyswap)、**Binance Labs**领投，Sino Global Capital、Defiance、Delphi Digital、Robot Ventures，Spartan、Hypersphere Ventures、Protocol Ventures和Gen Block Capital参投。\n* A+轮(2022.3) $135M：**FTX Ventures**、**红杉资本**、**a16z**领投，**Coinbase Ventures**、PayPal Ventures、Tiger Global、Uniswap Labs、Animoca Brands、软银CEO Rene Marcelo Claure 、Avalanche生态基金、Polygon生态基金、Fantom生态基金、Dapper Labs、ImToken Ventures、Matrixport、Gemini参投。\n* 待定 (2022.5) 最近正以30亿美元估值进行融资谈判，FTX Ventures承诺领投\n\n交互点：\n\n* 交互使用LayerZero协议的项目\n\n支持生态：Ethereum、BSC、Avalanche、Polygon、Arbitrum、Optimism、Fantom。\n\n[https://layerzero.network/](https://layerzero.network/)\n\n### 2.
