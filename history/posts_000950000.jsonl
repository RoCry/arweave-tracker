Macroeconomics studies economy-wide phenomena such as [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp), price levels, rate of [economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp), national income, [gross domestic product (GDP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp), and changes in [unemployment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp).\n\nSome of the key questions addressed by macroeconomics include: What causes unemployment? What causes [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp)? What creates or stimulates economic growth? Macroeconomics attempts to measure how well an economy is performing, to understand what forces drive it, and to project how performance can improve.\n\nMacroeconomics deals with the performance, structure, and behavior of the entire economy, in contrast to [microeconomics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microeconomics.asp), which is more focused on the choices made by individual actors in the economy (like people, households, industries, etc.).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that deals with the structure, performance, behavior, and decision-making of the whole, or aggregate, economy.\n* The two main areas of macroeconomic research are long-term economic growth and shorter-term business cycles.\n* Macroeconomics in its modern form is often defined as starting with John Maynard Keynes and his theories about market behavior and governmental policies in the 1930s; several schools of thought have developed since.\n* In contrast to macroeconomics, microeconomics is more focused on the influences on and choices made by individual actors in the economy (people, companies, industries, etc.).\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:45\n\n#### Macroeconomics\n\n## Understanding Macroeconomics\n\nThere are two sides to the study of economics: macroeconomics and microeconomics. As the term implies, macroeconomics looks at the overall, big-picture scenario of the economy. Put simply, it focuses on the way the economy performs as a whole and then analyzes how different sectors of the economy relate to one another to understand how the aggregate functions. This includes looking at variables like unemployment, [GDP, and inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/112814/why-does-inflation-increase-gdp-growth.asp). Macroeconomists develop models explaining relationships between these factors. Such macroeconomic models, and the forecasts they produce, are used by government entities to aid in the construction and evaluation of economic, monetary, and fiscal policy; by businesses to set strategy in domestic and global markets; and by investors to predict and plan for movements in various asset classes.\n\nGiven the enormous scale of government budgets and the impact of economic policy on consumers and businesses, macroeconomics clearly concerns itself with significant issues. Properly applied, economic theories can offer illuminating insights on how economies function and the long-term consequences of particular policies and decisions. Macroeconomic theory can also help individual businesses and investors make better decisions through a more thorough understanding of the effects of broad economic trends and policies on their own industries.\n\n## Limits of Macroeconomics\n\nIt is also important to understand the limitations of economic theory. Theories are often created in a vacuum and lack certain real-world details like taxation, regulation, and transaction costs. The real world is also decidedly complicated and includes matters of social preference and conscience that do not lend themselves to mathematical analysis.\n\nEven with the limits of economic theory, it is important and worthwhile to follow the major macroeconomic indicators like GDP, inflation, and unemployment. The performance of companies, and by extension their stocks, is significantly influenced by the economic conditions in which the companies operate and the study of macroeconomic statistics can help an investor make better decisions and spot turning points.\n\nLikewise, it can be invaluable to understand which theories are in favor and influencing a particular government administration. The underlying economic principles of a government will say much about how that government will approach taxation, regulation, government spending, and similar policies. By better understanding economics and the ramifications of economic decisions, investors can get at least a glimpse of the probable future and act accordingly with confidence.\n\n## Areas of Macroeconomic Research\n\nMacroeconomics is a rather broad field, but two specific areas of research are representative of this discipline. The first area is the factors that determine long-term [economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp), or increases in the national income. The other involves the causes and consequences of short-term fluctuations in national income and employment, also known as the [business cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp).\n\n### Economic Growth\n\nEconomic growth refers to an increase in aggregate production in an economy. Macroeconomists try to understand the factors that either promote or retard economic growth in order to support economic policies that will support development, progress, and rising living standards.\n\nAdam Smith's classic 18th-century work, *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,* which advocated free trade, laissez-faire economic policy, and expanding the division of labor*,* was arguably the first, and certainly one of the seminal works in this body of research. By the 20th century, macroeconomists began to study growth with more formal mathematical models. Growth is commonly modeled as a function of physical capital, human capital, labor force, and technology.1\n\n### Business Cycles\n\nSuperimposed over long term macroeconomic growth trends, the levels and rates-of-change of major macroeconomic variables such as employment and national output go through occasional fluctuations up or down, expansions and recessions, in a phenomenon known as the business cycle. The 2008 financial crisis is a clear recent example, and the Great Depression of the 1930s was actually the impetus for the development of most modern macroeconomic theory.\n\n## History of Macroeconomics\n\nWhile the term \"macroeconomics\" is not all that old (going back to the 1940s), many of the core concepts in macroeconomics have been the focus of study for much longer. Topics like unemployment, prices, growth, and trade have concerned economists almost from the very beginning of the discipline, though their study has become much more focused and specialized through the 20th and 21st centuries. Elements of earlier work from the likes of Adam Smith and [John Stuart Mill](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john-stuart-mill.asp) clearly addressed issues that would now be recognized as the domain of macroeconomics.\n\nMacroeconomics, as it is in its modern form, is often defined as starting with [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) and the publication of his book *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* in 1936. Keynes offered an explanation for the fallout from the [Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp), when goods remained unsold and workers unemployed. Keynes's theory attempted to explain why markets may not clear.\n\nPrior to the popularization of Keynes' theories, economists did not generally differentiate between micro- and macroeconomics. The same microeconomic laws of supply and demand that operate in individual goods markets were understood to interact between individuals markets to bring the economy into a [general equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-equilibrium-theory.asp), as described by Leon Walras. The link between goods markets and large-scale [financial](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-finance/) variables such as price levels and interest rates was explained through the unique role that money plays in the economy as a medium of exchange by economists such as Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher, and Ludwig von Mises.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Keynesian economics, as Keynes' theories became known, diverged into several other schools of thought.\n\n## Macroeconomic Schools of Thought\n\nThe field of macroeconomics is organized into many different schools of thought, with differing views on how the markets and their participants operate.\n\n### Classical\n\n[Classical economists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/classicaleconomics.asp) held that prices, wages, and rates are flexible and markets tend to clear unless prevented from doing so by government policy, building on Adam Smith's original theories. The term “classical economists” is not actually a school of macroeconomic thought, but a label applied first by Karl Marx and later by Keynes to denote previous economic thinkers with whom they respectively disagreed, but who themselves did not actually differentiate macroeconomics from microeconomics at all. \n\n### Keynesian\n\n[Keynesian economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp) was largely founded on the basis of the works of John Maynard Keynes, and was the beginning of macroeconomics as a separate area of study from microeconomics. Keynesians focus on [aggregate demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp) as the principal factor in issues like unemployment and the business cycle. Keynesian economists believe that the business cycle can be managed by active government intervention through fiscal policy (spending more in recessions to stimulate demand) and monetary policy (stimulating demand with lower rates). Keynesian economists also believe that there are certain rigidities in the system, particularly [sticky prices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_stickiness.asp) that prevent the proper clearing of supply and demand.\n\n### Monetarist\n\nThe [Monetarist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarism.asp) school is a branch of Keynesian economics largely credited to the works of Milton Friedman. Working within and extending Keynesian models, Monetarists argue that monetary policy is generally a more effective and more desirable policy tool to manage aggregate demand than fiscal policy. Monetarists also acknowledge limits to monetary policy that make fine tuning the economy ill advised and instead tend to prefer adherence to policy rules that promote stable rates of inflation.\n\n### New Classical\n\nThe New Classical school, along with the New Keynesians, is built largely on the goal of integrating microeconomic foundations into macroeconomics in order to resolve the glaring theoretical contradictions between the two subjects. The New Classical school emphasizes the importance of microeconomics and models based on that behavior. New Classical economists assume that all agents try to maximize their utility and have [rational expectations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rationaltheoryofexpectations.asp), which they incorporate into macroeconomic models. New Classical economists believe that unemployment is largely voluntary and that discretionary fiscal policy is destabilizing, while inflation can be controlled with monetary policy.\n\n### New Keynesian\n\nThe [New Keynesian](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/new-keynesian-economics.asp) school also attempts to add microeconomic foundations to traditional Keynesian economic theories. While New Keynesians do accept that households and firms operate on the basis of rational expectations, they still maintain that there are a variety of market failures, including sticky prices and wages. Because of this \"stickiness\", the government can improve macroeconomic conditions through fiscal and monetary policy.\n\n### Austrian\n\nThe [Austrian Schoo](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/austrian-school-of-economics.asp)[l](https://external.investopedia.com/terms/a/austrian_school.asp) is an older school of economics that is seeing some resurgence in popularity. Austrian economic theories mostly apply to microeconomic phenomena, but because they, like the so-called classical economists never strictly separated micro- and macroeconomics, Austrian theories also have important implications for what are otherwise considered macroeconomic subjects. In particular the Austrian business cycle theory explains broadly synchronized (macroeconomic) swings in economic activity across markets as a result of monetary policy and the role that money and banking play in linking (microeconomic) markets to each other and across time. \n\n## Macroeconomics vs. Microeconomics\n\nMacroeconomics [differs from microeconomics](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-microeconomics-and-macroeconomics/), which focuses on smaller factors that affect choices made by individuals and companies. Factors studied in both microeconomics and macroeconomics typically have an influence on one another. For example, the [unemployment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp) level in the economy as a whole has an effect on the supply of workers from which a company can hire.\n\nA key distinction between micro- and macroeconomics is that macroeconomic aggregates can sometimes behave in ways that are very different or even the opposite of the way that analogous microeconomic variables do. For example, Keynes referenced the so-called Paradox of Thrift, which argues that while for an individual, saving money may be the key building wealth, when everyone tries to increase their savings at once it can contribute to a slowdown in the economy and *less* wealth in the aggregate.\n\nMeanwhile, microeconomics looks at economic tendencies, or what can happen when individuals make certain choices. Individuals are typically classified into subgroups, such as buyers, [sellers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp), and business owners. These actors interact with each other according to the laws of [supply and demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp) for resources, using money and interest rates as pricing mechanisms for coordination.", "timestamp": 1654655003, "digest": "6WSVmJG0tP9Ih-3DTzwn1G49c4DamMa6_nywBxbO9s4", "contributor": "0x24C4aB0600E18a789a077Efc1AF354766f437e15"}

{"id": "fbdAlGM7eo5U7e1OIsukZT4LzLnGbEr8ZcKYJlFjzpw", "title": "Mutually Exclusive", "body": "## What Is Mutually Exclusive?\n\nMutually exclusive is a [statistical](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistics.asp) term describing two or more events that cannot happen simultaneously. It is commonly used to describe a situation where the occurrence of one outcome supersedes the other. For example, war and peace cannot coexist at the same time. This makes them mutually exclusive.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Events are considered to be mutually exclusive when they cannot happen at the same time.\n* The concept often comes up in the business world in the assessment of budgeting and dealmaking.\n* If considering mutually exclusive options, a company must weigh the opportunity cost, or what it would be giving up by choosing each option.\n* The time value of money (TVM) is often considered when deciding between two mutually exclusive choices.\n* Not mutually exclusive means that two instances or outcomes can occur simultaneously, and one outcome does not limit the other from being possible.\n\n## Understanding Mutually Exclusive\n\nMutually exclusive events are events that can't both happen, but should not be considered independent events. Independent events have no impact on the viability of other options. For a basic example, consider the rolling of dice. You cannot roll both a five and a three simultaneously on a single die. However, you absolutely can roll a five and a three on two dice. Rolling a five and three simultaneously means this outcome is mutually exclusive. Rolling a five on one and a three on the other means they are not mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\n### Opportunity Cost\n\nWhen faced with a choice between mutually exclusive options, a company must consider the [opportunity cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp), which is what the company would be giving up to pursue each option. The concepts of opportunity cost and mutual exclusivity are inherently linked because each mutually exclusive option requires the sacrifice of whatever profits could have been generated by choosing the alternate option.\n\nThe [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) (TVM) and other factors make mutually exclusive analysis a bit more complicated. For a more comprehensive comparison, companies use the [net present value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) (NPV) and [internal rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp) (IRR) formulas to mathematically determine which project is most beneficial when choosing between two or more mutually exclusive options.\n\n## Example of Mutually Exclusive\n\nThe concept of mutual exclusivity is often applied in [capital budgeting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalbudgeting.asp). Companies may have to choose between multiple projects that will add value to the company upon completion. Some of these projects are mutually exclusive.\n\nFor example, assume a company has a budget of $50,000 for expansion projects. If available Projects A and B each cost $40,000 and Project C costs only $10,000, then Projects A and B are mutually exclusive. If the company pursues A, it cannot also afford to pursue B and vice versa. Project C may be considered independent. Regardless of which other project is pursued, the company can still afford to pursue C as well. The acceptance of either A or B does not impact the viability of C, and the acceptance of C does not impact the viability of either of the other projects.\n\nMoreover, when looking at opportunity costs, consider the analysis of Projects A and B. Assume that Project A has a potential return of $100,000, while Project B will only return $80,000. Since A and B are mutually exclusive, the opportunity cost of choosing B is equal to the profit of the most lucrative option (in this case, A) minus the profits generated by the selected option (B); that is, $100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000. Because option A is the most lucrative option, the opportunity cost of going for option A is $0.\n\n## What Does It Mean If Projects Are Mutually Exclusive?\n\nIn business, managers and directors often need to plan resource allocation. If a company is building a bridge and a skyscraper, and both projects require an extremely specialized piece of equipment and only one exists in the world, it would mean that these projects are mutually exclusive, as that piece of equipment cannot be used by both projects at the same time. This idea can be extended to consider specialized professionals, software systems (which cannot run both Mac and Windows), and allocated budgets.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between Independent and Mutually Exclusive?\n\nTo illustrate the difference between what is independent and what is mutually exclusive, consider the war and peace example from earlier. There could be war in France and peace in Italy. These are two independent nations and therefore each one could be in its own state of peace. However, there cannot be war in France and peace in France. Since they cannot coexist, that makes them mutually exclusive.\n\n## What Does Mutually Exclusive Mean in Finance?\n\nTypically, this involves budgeting and payments. If a company has $180 million to spend, it cannot spend that $180 million both by reinvesting in the business and offering bonuses to upper management. In this case, those two options are mutually exclusive. If the company can only retain licensing in a single country, that means they should not attempt to be licensed in two separate countries as they are mutually exclusive.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThings that are mutually exclusive are not able to occur simultaneously. In business, this is typically concerning the undertaking of projects or allocating a budget. If two things are not mutually exclusive, it means the existence and occurrence of one does not necessarily mean the other cannot coexist.", "timestamp": 1654655259, "digest": "Thw6ImABSxX6PbREgf7zy3WSSRy5TWK6Tq8eZrsQ5yc", "contributor": "0xa6dc3e455F584E4C68Ab8b0eE17f5e19196059a8"}
{"id": "fPmy5b7BZpVLgEKJgZw9hTH80w8udGtUoE0mwG0cwsg", "title": "Coefficient of Variation (CV)", "body": "## What Is the Coefficient of Variation (CV)?\n\nThe coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure of the dispersion of data points in a data series around the mean. The coefficient of variation represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, and it is a useful statistic for comparing the degree of variation from one data series to another, even if the means are drastically different from one another.\n\n## Understanding the Coefficient of Variation\n\nThe coefficient of variation shows the extent of [variability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variability.asp) of data in a sample in relation to the mean of the population. In finance, the coefficient of variation allows investors to determine how much volatility, or risk, is assumed in comparison to the amount of return expected from investments. Ideally, if the coefficient of variation formula should result in a lower ratio of the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) to mean return, then the better the risk-return trade-off. Note that if the expected return in the denominator is negative or zero, the coefficient of variation could be misleading.\n\nThe coefficient of variation is helpful when using the risk/reward ratio to select investments. For example, an investor who is risk-averse may want to consider assets with a historically low degree of [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) relative to the return, in relation to the overall market or its industry. Conversely, risk-seeking investors may look to invest in assets with a historically high degree of volatility.\n\nWhile most often used to analyze dispersion around the mean, quartile, quintile, or decile CVs can also be used to understand variation around the median or 10th percentile, for example.\n\nThe coefficient of variation formula or calculation can be used to determine the deviation between the historical mean price and the current price performance of a stock, commodity, or bond, relative to other assets.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure of the relative dispersion of data points in a data series around the mean.\n* In finance, the coefficient of variation allows investors to determine how much volatility, or risk, is assumed in comparison to the amount of return expected from investments.\n* The lower the ratio of the standard deviation to mean return, the better risk-return trade-off.\n\n## Coefficient of Variation Formula\n\nBelow is the formula for how to calculate the coefficient of variation:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{CV} = \\\\frac { \\\\sigma }{ \\\\mu } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\sigma = \\\\text{standard deviation} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\mu = \\\\text{mean} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​CV=*μσ*​where:*σ*=standard deviation*μ*=mean​﻿\n\nPlease note that if the expected return in the denominator of the coefficient of variation formula is negative or zero, the result could be misleading.\n\n### Coefficient of Variation in Excel\n\nThe coefficient of variation formula can be performed in Excel by first using the standard deviation function for a data set. Next, calculate the mean using the Excel function provided. Since the coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean, divide the cell containing the standard deviation by the cell containing the mean.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:23\n\n#### Coefficient Of Variation (CV)\n\n## Example of Coefficient of Variation for Selecting Investments\n\nFor example, consider a risk-averse investor who wishes to invest in an [exchange-traded fund (ETF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp), which is a basket of securities that tracks a broad market index. The investor selects the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, Invesco QQQ ETF, and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF.

{"id": "J9bcX5dqr8TTQlip6USx74ah2oW-_DUPP8OWVqGQKvo", "title": "Laissez-Faire", "body": "## What Is Laissez-Faire?\n\nLaissez-faire is an economic theory from the 18th century that opposed any government intervention in business affairs. The driving principle behind laissez-faire, a French term that translates to \"leave alone\" (literally, \"let you do\"), is that the less the government is involved in the economy, the better off business will be, and by extension, society as a whole. Laissez-faire economics is a key part of [free-market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp) capitalism.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Laissez-faire is an economic philosophy of free-market capitalism that opposes government intervention.\n* The theory of laissez-faire was developed by the French Physiocrats during the 18th century and believes that economic success is more likely the less governments are involved in business.\n* Later free-market economists built on the ideas of laissez-faire as a path to economic prosperity, though detractors have criticized it for promoting inequality.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 14 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:14\n\n#### Laissez Faire\n\n## Understanding Laissez-Faire\n\nThe underlying beliefs that make up the fundamentals of laissez-faire economics include the idea that economic competition constitutes a \"natural order\" that rules the world. Because this natural self-regulation is the best type of regulation, laissez-faire [economists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp) argue that there is no need for business and industrial affairs to be complicated by government intervention.\n\nAs a result, they oppose any sort of federal involvement in the economy, which includes any type of legislation or oversight; they are against [minimum wages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp), duties, trade restrictions, and [corporate taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatetax.asp). In fact, laissez-faire economists see such taxes as a penalty for production.\n\n## History of Laissez-Faire\n\nPopularized in the mid-1700s, the doctrine of laissez-faire is one of the first articulated economic theories. It originated with a group known as the Physiocrats, who flourished in France from about 1756 to 1778.1\n\nLed by a physician, they tried to apply scientific principles and methodology to the study of wealth. These \"économistes\" (as they dubbed themselves) argued that a free market and free economic [competition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfectcompetition.asp) were extremely important to the health of a free society.2 The government should only intervene in the economy to preserve property, life, and individual freedom; otherwise, the natural, unchanging laws that govern market forces and economic processes—what later British economist [Adam Smith](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-economics/), dubbed the \"[invisible hand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp)\"—should be allowed to proceed unhindered.\n\nLegend has it that the origins of the phrase \"laissez-faire\" in an economic context came from a 1681 meeting between the French finance minister Jean-Baptise Colbert and a businessman named Le Gendre. As the story goes, Colbert asked Le Gendre how best the government could help commerce, to which Le Gendre replied \"*Laissez-nous faire*;\" basically, \"Let it be.\" The Physiocrats popularized the phrase, using it to name their core economic doctrine.3\n\nUnfortunately, an early effort to test laissez-faire theories did not go well. As an experiment in 1774, Turgot, Louis XVI's Controller-General of Finances, abolished all restraints on the heavily controlled grain industry, allowing imports and exports between provinces to operate as a free trade system.\n\nBut when poor harvests caused scarcities, prices shot through the roof; merchants ended up hoarding supplies or selling grain in strategic areas, even outside the country for better profit, while thousands of French citizens starved. Riots ensued for several months. In the middle of 1775, the order was restored, and with it, government controls over the grain market.4\n\nDespite this inauspicious start, laissez-faire practices, developed further by such British economists as Smith and [David Ricardo](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/david-ricardo.asp), ruled during the [Industrial Revolution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-revolution.asp) of the late 18th and early 19th century. And, as its detractors noted, it did result in unsafe working conditions and large wealth gaps.\n\nOnly at the beginning of the 20th century did developed industrialized nations like the U.S. begin to implement significant government controls and regulations to protect workers from hazardous conditions and consumers from unfair business practices; though it’s important to note that these policies were not intended to restrict business practices and competition.\n\n## Criticism of Laissez-Faire\n\nOne of the chief criticisms of laissez-faire is that capitalism as a system has moral ambiguities built into it: It does not inherently protect the weakest in society. While laissez-faire advocates argue that if individuals serve their own interests first, societal benefits will follow.\n\nDetractors feel laissez-faire actually leads to poverty and economic imbalances. The idea of letting an economic system run without regulation or correction in effect dismisses or further victimizes those most in need of assistance, they say.\n\nThe 20th-century British economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) was a prominent critic of laissez-faire economics, and he argued that the question of market solution versus government intervention needed to be decided on a case-by-case basis.", "timestamp": 1654655179, "digest": "JLQoXWhjNEYcVeL7Npm49KeUnF-QOrVMsdWnWPie7tQ", "contributor": "0x7f95Ffaa02F316f32773Cbf97777B8C2eF41E214"}
{"id": "oOHhP1qEMRSuFtnAWiG_UTcrqwLH_Gg6snhBqV4WCBQ", "title": "Magna Cum Laude", "body": "## What Is Magna Cum Laude?\n\nMagna cum laude is an academic honorific used by educational institutions to signify that an academic degree was earned with notable distinction. The Latin phrase means \"with great praise.\"\n\nMagna cum laude is one of three commonly used academic degree honors at educational institutions in the United States and many other countries. The others are [summa cum laude](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/summa-cum-laude.asp), meaning with highest distinction, and [cum laude](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cum-laude.asp), or \"with distinction.\" The titles are referred to as Latin honors because they retain their original Latin forms.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Magna cum laude is an academic honorific awarded to students who have achieved academic excellence.\n* Many colleges award magna cum laude honors in addition to summa cum laude honors, which are above magna cum laude, and cum laude honors, which are just below.\n* The practice of awarding Latin honors began at Harvard in the mid-19th century and has spread to colleges and universities around the world.\n\n## Understanding Magna Cum Laude\n\nMagna cum laude is more prestigious than cum laude honors but [less prestigious than summa cum laude](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032415/what-difference-between-magnum-cum-laude-and-summa-cum-laude.asp). The criteria by which each of these distinctions is achieved depends on the specific requirements of each institution. The awarding of Latin honors is common in colleges and universities in the United States, although not all bestow them. Many high schools also grant Latin honors.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:30\n\n#### Magna Cum Laude\n\nLatin honors are most commonly awarded in conjunction with a bachelor's degree. Students who graduate with honors may wear stoles of a distinct color or some other designation during commencement ceremonies, and their honors may be cited when their names are read. Latin honors are generally included in a student's official transcript.\n\n## Requirements for Magna Cum Laude\n\nThe criteria for earning Latin honors may include the student's grade point average (GPA), class rank, number of hours completed, and recommendations from an academic department.\n\nSome schools have substituted other titles, such as \"with distinction,\" in place of or in addition to the traditional Latin terms.\n\n### Note\n\n*Some colleges base their GPA requirements for Latin honors on a percentage of the graduating class, meaning they change every year.*\n\n## Real-World Examples of Magna Cum Laude\n\nThe academic thresholds for honors differ among academic institutions and even between programs at the same institution. Texas A&M graduates, for instance, must complete 60 credit hours while earning a GPA of 3.70 to 3.899 to earn their degree magna cum laude.1\n\nAt some universities, the GPA requirements for Latin honors change every academic year because they are based on a percentage of the student's class. For example, for a student to graduate magna cum laude in engineering from the University of California Los Angeles, they must finish between the top 5% and 10% of their class after completing 90 credits. For the 2019–2020 academic year, they needed a GPA of at least 3.839, while the cutoff for 2020-2021 was 3.857.2\n\nBy contrast, at Harvard University, where Latin honors originated in the mid-19th century, undergraduates completing degrees with an overall GPA in the top 20% of all graduates will receive either summa cum laude or magna cum laude distinction, with the summa honorific reserved for students with the highest GPAs.3\n\nBrown University, on the other hand, does not use a student's GPA in its calculation. Students are eligible for just one Latin honor, magna cum laude, upon graduation. A student achieves the honor by earning a high percentage of \"A\" grades and \"S\" for distinction marks for courses. No more than 20% of a graduating class can earn magna cum laude honors.4\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nColleges may consider other non-GPA factors in their decisions to grant magna cum laude status. An institution might require that students complete an honors thesis to be eligible. Others seek letters of recommendation from faculty members, attesting to students' exceptional academic performance. Others stipulate that students must complete a certain number of advanced courses.\n\nSome colleges, including Stanford University, do not offer Latin honors at all. Stanford bestows a single \"with distinction\" title on the 15% of students with the highest GPA in each graduating class.5", "timestamp": 1654655083, "digest": "IBtk12LtiGv4D2LUQRehYAHPV5En2gEWWysm1VUFE_0", "contributor": "0xf6E293648Bd38C3eee4B568656892efa475467cB"}

{"id": "oeX4TUIYVuL-HtlxxWZ2QLcEtF_Z8XmWqoEupyrGFpU", "title": "Collateral\n", "body": "## What Is Collateral?\n\nThe term collateral refers to an [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) that a lender accepts as security for a loan. Collateral may take the form of real estate or other kinds of assets, depending on the purpose of the loan. The collateral acts as a form of protection for the lender. That is, if the borrower [defaults](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on their loan payments, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup some or all of its losses.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Collateral is an item of value used to secure a loan.\n* Collateral minimizes the risk for lenders.\n* If a borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup its losses.\n* Mortgages and car loans are two types of collateralized loans.\n* Other personal assets, such as a savings or investment account, can be used to secure a collateralized personal loan.\n\n## How Collateral Works\n\nBefore a lender issues you a loan, it wants to know that you have the ability to repay it. That's why many of them require some form of security. This security is called collateral which minimizes the [risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp) for lenders. It helps to ensure that the borrower keeps up with their financial [obligation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp). In the event that the borrower does default, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it, applying the money it gets to the unpaid portion of the loan. The lender can choose to pursue legal action against the borrower to recoup any balance remaining.\n\nAs mentioned above, collateral can take many forms. It normally relates to the nature of the loan, so a mortgage is collateralized by the home, while the collateral for a car loan is the vehicle in question. Other nonspecific, personal loans can be [collateralized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateralization.asp) by other assets. For instance, a secured [credit card](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp) may be secured by a cash deposit for the same amount of the credit limit—$500 for a $500 credit limit.\n\nLoans secured by collateral are typically available at substantially lower interest rates than unsecured loans. A lender's claim to a borrower's collateral is called a [lien](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp)—a legal right or claim against an asset to satisfy a debt. The borrower has a compelling reason to repay the loan on time because if they default, they stand to lose their home or other assets pledged as collateral.\n\n## Types of Collateral\n\nThe nature of the collateral is often predetermined by the [loan type](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/loan_types.asp). When you take out a mortgage, your home becomes the collateral. If you take out a car loan, then the car is the collateral for the loan. The types of collateral that lenders commonly accept include cars—only if they are paid off in full—bank savings deposits, and investment accounts. [Retirement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp) accounts are not usually accepted as collateral.\n\nYou also may use future paychecks as collateral for very short-term loans, and not just from [payday lenders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payday-loans.asp). Traditional banks offer such loans, usually for terms no longer than a couple of weeks. These short-term loans are an option in a genuine emergency, but even then, you should read the [fine print](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fineprint.asp) carefully and compare rates.\n\n### Collateralized Personal Loans\n\nAnother type of borrowing is the collateralized personal loan, in which the borrower offers an item of value as security for a loan. The value of the collateral must meet or exceed the amount being loaned. If you are considering a collateralized personal loan, your best choice for a lender is probably a [financial institution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp) that you already do business with, especially if your collateral is your savings account. If you already have a relationship with the bank, that bank would be more inclined to approve the loan, and you are more apt to get a decent rate for it.\n\nUse a financial institution with which you already have a relationship if you're considering a collateralized personal loan.\n\n## Examples of Collateral Loans\n\n### Residential Mortgages\n\nA mortgage is a loan in which the house is the collateral. If the homeowner stops paying the mortgage for at least 120 days, the loan servicer can begin legal proceedings which can lead to the lender eventually taking possession of the house through [foreclosure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp).1 Once the property is transferred to the lender, it can be sold to repay the remaining principal on the loan.\n\n### Home Equity Loans\n\nA home may also function as collateral on a second mortgage or [home equity line of credit (HELOC)](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/). In this case, the amount of the loan will not exceed the available equity. For example, if a home is valued at $200,000, and $125,000 remains on the primary mortgage, a second mortgage or HELOC will be available only for as much as $75,000.\n\n### Margin Trading\n\nCollateralized loans are also a factor in [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) trading. An investor borrows money from a broker to buy shares, using the balance in the investor's brokerage account as collateral. The loan increases the number of shares the investor can buy, thus multiplying the potential gains if the shares increase in value. But the risks are also multiplied. If the shares decrease in value, the [broker](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) demands payment of the difference.

{"id": "CSqD7iFy-AlZTAM9qoZ6nUoP7y6bAHppAq6Nx3GyqFM", "title": "Ltd. (Limited)", "body": "## What Is Ltd. (Limited)?\n\nLtd. is a standard abbreviation for \"limited,\" a form of corporate structure available in countries including the U.K., Ireland, and Canada. The term appears as a suffix that follows the company name, indicating that it is a private [limited company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limited_company.asp). In a limited company, shareholders' liability is limited to the capital they originally invested. If such a company becomes [insolvent](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp), the [shareholders'](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) personal assets remain protected.\n\nLimited companies are an organizational form that features limited liability.\n\n## The Basics of a Ltd. Company Structure\n\nA limited company is its own legal entity. A private limited company has one or more members, also called shareholders or owners, who buy in through private sales. Directors are company employees who keep up with all administrative tasks and tax filings but do not need to be shareholders.\n\nThe company’s finances are separate from the owners’ and are taxed separately. The [company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/company.asp) owns all profits and pays taxes on them, distributes a portion to shareholders as dividends and retains the rest as [working capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp). A director may withdraw funds only for a salary or dividend payment or loan.\n\nBy setting up a private limited company, it becomes separate from the people who run it. Any profits made by the company can be pocketed after taxes are paid. The corporation's finances must be kept separate from any personal ones in order to avoid confusion.\n\n[Public limited companies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plc.asp) (PLCs) are also commonly used in the U.K. and some Commonwealth countries, as opposed to \"Inc.\" or \"Ltd.,\" which are the norm in the U.S. and elsewhere. The mandatory use of the PLC abbreviation after the name of the company serves to instantly inform investors, or anyone dealing with the company, that the company is public and probably fairly large.1﻿\n\nPLCs can be listed or unlisted on a stock exchange. Like any other major entity, they are strictly regulated and are required to publish their true financial health so shareholders (and future stakeholders) can size up the true worth of their stock. The lifespan of a PLC is not determined by the death of a shareholder.\n\nPLCs are often best used to raise capital, but they also bring increased regulation.\n\n### FAST FACT\n\nAll companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) are PLCs.\n\n## How to Set up a Private Limited Company\n\nFor anyone in the U.K., there are several things you'll need in order to set up a private limited company, including:2﻿ 3﻿\n\n* A business name and address\n* At least one director and at least one shareholder\n* A memorandum and articles of association (an agreement to create the company and the rules in writing)\n* Names of people who have significant control over the company (people with more than 25 percent of the shares or [voting rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp))\n\nOnce you have these together, you can then register as a private limited company. \n\n## Types of Limited Companies\n\nLimited company structures are common worldwide and are codified in many nations, though the regulations governing them can differ widely from one nation to the next. For example, in the United Kingdom, there are private limited companies and public limited companies.\n\nPrivate limited companies are not permitted to offer shares to the public. They are, however, the most popular structures for a small business. Public limited companies (PLCs) may offer shares to the public to raise capital. Those shares may trade on a stock exchange once a total share value threshold is met (at least GBP 50,000).4﻿ Such a structure is widely employed by larger companies.\n\nIn the United States, a limited company is more commonly known as a corporation (corp.) or with the suffix incorporated (inc.). Some states in the U.S. do permit the use of Ltd. (limited) after a company name. Such a designation depends on filing the correct paperwork; just adding the suffix to a company name does not provide any liability protection. Limited companies in the U.S. are required to file corporate taxes annually with regulators.5﻿ A [limited liability company (LLC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp) and limited companies have different structures.\n\nMany countries differentiate between public and private limited companies. For example, in Germany, the Aktiengesellschaft (AG) designation is for public limited companies that can sell shares to the public while GmbH is for private limited companies that cannot issue shares.\n\n## Advantages of a Private Limited Company\n\nBecause the number of shareholders is unlimited, liability is spread among multiple owners rather than just one. A shareholder loses only as much as he invested if the company becomes insolvent. For example, say a private limited company issues 100 shares valued at $150 each. Shareholder A and Shareholder B own 50 shares each and paid in full for 25 shares each. If the company becomes insolvent, the maximum amount Shareholder A and Shareholder B each pay is $3,750, the value of the remaining 25 unpaid shares each member holds.\n\nA private limited company has greater tax advantages than a [sole proprietorship](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp), partnership, or similar organization. The company exists into perpetuity even if an owner sells or transfers his shares, securing jobs, and resources for the community. Because a private limited company produces goods at a lower cost and increases profits, financial institutions loan the company more money for operations and expansions and the company’s annual revenue increases.\n\n## Disadvantages of a Private Limited Company\n\nShares are sold privately, restricting the amount of capital raised. All shareholders must agree to sell or transfer shares to someone outside the company. The company can borrow money, but a director must offer a personal guarantee to repay the debt if the company cannot; the director’s personal assets are put at stake and not protected under private limited company laws. If a loan is owed to the company at year-end, additional taxes apply. A director becomes personally liable if the company becomes insolvent and the director does not act in the best interest of the creditors.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Ltd. is a standard abbreviation for \"limited,\" a form of corporate structure available in countries including the U.K., Ireland, and Canada, and appears as a suffix after the company name.\n* Limited companies limit the liability of a corporate loss to the business and do not impact the private assets of owners or investors.\n* Limited companies may be set up as either private or public (PLC).", "timestamp": 1654655417, "digest": "EcpF885FlpqAtk9XL6Tj2b3qXqT3Sdj-iH19Wdiquvg", "contributor": "0x2D4698A9e01294073FD2F6226aBD610654Efdaf1"}

{"id": "9yyEyWfAkVwqHdZbXW__VUIMuoEmBUaULlnZtG6jvi4", "title": "London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)", "body": "## What Is London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)?\n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a [benchmark](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans.\n\nLIBOR, which stands for London Interbank Offered Rate, serves as a globally accepted key benchmark interest rate that indicates borrowing costs between banks. The rate is calculated and will continue to be published each day by the [Intercontinental Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intercontinentalexchange.asp) (ICE), but due to recent scandals and questions around its validity as a benchmark rate, it is being phased out. According to the Federal Reserve and regulators in the UK, LIBOR will be phased out by June 30, 2023, and will be replaced by the [Secured Overnight Financing Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954) (SOFR). As part of this phase-out, LIBOR one-week and two-month USD LIBOR rates will no longer be published after Dec. 31, 2021.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* LIBOR is the benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another.\n* LIBOR is administered by the Intercontinental Exchange, which asks major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans.\n* The rate is calculated using the Waterfall Methodology, a standardized, transaction-based, data-driven, layered method.\n* LIBOR has been subject to manipulation, scandal, and methodological critique, making it less credible today as a benchmark rate.\n* LIBOR is being replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) on June 30, 2023, with phase-out of its use beginning after 2021.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:22\n\n#### London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)\n\n## Understanding LIBOR\n\nLIBOR is the average interest rate at which major global banks borrow from one another. It is based on five currencies including the U.S. dollar, the [euro](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp), the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc, and serves seven different maturities—overnight/spot next, one week, and one, two, three, six, and 12 months.1﻿\n\nThe combination of five currencies and seven maturities leads to a total of 35 different LIBOR rates calculated and reported each business day.1﻿ The most commonly quoted rate is the three-month U.S. dollar rate, usually referred to as the current LIBOR rate.\n\nEach day, ICE asks major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans. The association takes out the highest and lowest figures, then calculates the average from the remaining numbers. This is known as the trimmed average. This rate is posted each morning as the daily rate, so it's not a static figure. Once the rates for each maturity and currency are calculated and finalized, they are announced and published once a day at around 11:55 a.m. London time by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA).1﻿\n\nLIBOR is also the basis for consumer loans in countries around the world, so it impacts consumers just as much as it does financial institutions. The interest rates on various credit products such as credit cards, car loans, and adjustable-rate mortgages fluctuate based on the [interbank rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interbankrate.asp). This change in rate helps determine the ease of borrowing between banks and consumers.\n\nBut there is a downside to using the LIBOR rate. Even though lower borrowing costs may be attractive to consumers, it does also affect the returns on certain securities. Some mutual funds may be attached to LIBOR, so their yields may drop as LIBOR fluctuates.\n\n## How Is LIBOR Calculated?\n\nThe IBA has constituted a designated panel of global banks for each currency and tenor pair. For example, 16 major banks, including Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, and UBS constitute the panel for U.S. dollar LIBOR.1 Only those banks that have a significant role in the London market are considered eligible for membership on the ICE LIBOR panel, and the selection process is held annually.\n\nAs of April 2018, the IBA submitted a new proposal to strengthen the LIBOR calculation methodology. It suggested using a standardized, transaction-based, data-driven, layered method called the Waterfall Methodology for determining LIBOR.2\n\n* The first transaction-based level involves taking a [volume-weighted average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp) (VWAP) of all eligible transactions a panel bank may have assigned a higher weighting for transactions booked closer to 11:00 a.m. London time.\n* The second transaction-derived level involved taking submissions based on transaction-derived data from a panel bank if it does not have a sufficient number of eligible transactions to make a Level 1 submission.\n* The third level—expert judgment—comes into play when a panel bank fails to make a Level 1 or a Level 2 submission. It submits the rate at which it could finance itself at 11:00 a.m. London time with reference to the unsecured, wholesale funding market.\n\nThe Waterfall Methodology retains the trimmed average calculation.\n\nThe IBA calculates the LIBOR rate using a [trimmed mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trimmed_mean.asp) approach applied to all the responses received. Trimmed mean is a method of averaging, which eliminates a small specified percentage of the largest and smallest values before calculating the mean. For LIBOR, figures in the highest and lowest quartile are thrown out, and averaging is performed on the remaining numbers.3\n\n## Uses of LIBOR\n\nLIBOR is used worldwide in a wide variety of financial products. They include the following:\n\n* Standard interbank products like the forward rate agreements (FRA), interest rate swaps, interest rate [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp), [options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), and [swaptions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swaption.asp), whereby options provide buyers with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security or interest rate product\n* Commercial products like floating rate certificate of deposits and notes, variable rate mortgages, and [syndicated loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/syndicatedloan.asp), which are loans offered by a group of lenders\n* Hybrid products like [collateralized debt obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) (CDO), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), and a wide variety of accrual notes, callable notes, and perpetual notes\n* Consumer loan-related products like individual mortgages and student loans\n\nLIBOR is also used as a standard gauge of market expectation for interest rates finalized by central banks. It accounts for the liquidity premiums for various instruments traded in the money markets, as well as an indicator of the health of the overall banking system. A lot of [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) products are created, launched, and traded in reference to LIBOR. LIBOR is also used as a reference rate for other standard processes like [clearing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearing.asp), price discovery, and product valuation.\n\n## A Brief History of LIBOR\n\nThe need for a uniform measure of interest rates across financial institutions became necessary as the market for interest rate-based products began evolving during the 1980s. The British Bankers’ Association (BBA)—which represented the banking and financial services industry—set up BBA interest-settlement rates in 1984. Further streamlining led to the evolution of BBA LIBOR in 1986, which became the default standard interest rate for transacting in the interest rate- and currency-based financial dealings between financial institutions at the local and international levels.4\n\nSince then, LIBOR has undergone many changes. The major one is when [BBA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/britishba.asp) LIBOR changed to ICE LIBOR in February 2014 after the Intercontinental Exchange took over the administration.5\n\nCurrencies involved in calculating LIBOR have also changed. While new currency rates have been added, many have been removed or integrated following the introduction of the euro rates. The 2008 financial crisis saw a significant decline in the number of tenors for which LIBOR was calculated.6\n\n## LIBOR Equivalents\n\nThough LIBOR is accepted globally, there are other similar regional interest rates that are popularly followed across the globe.\n\nFor instance, Europe has the European Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Japan has the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), China has Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR), and India has the [Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mibor.asp) (MIBOR).\n\n## LIBOR Scandal of Rate Rigging\n\nWhile LIBOR has been a long-established global benchmark standard for interest rates, it has had its fair share of controversies including a major [scandal of rate rigging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor-scandal.asp). Major banks allegedly colluded to manipulate the LIBOR rates. They took traders' requests into account and submitted artificially low LIBOR rates to keep them at their preferred levels. The intention behind the alleged malpractice was to bump up traders’ profits who were holding positions in LIBOR-based financial securities.7\n\nFollowing reporting by the Wall Street Journal in 2008, major global banks, which were on the panels and contributed to the LIBOR determination process, faced regulatory scrutiny.8 It involved investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice. Similar investigations were launched in other parts of the globe including in the U.K. and Europe. Major [banks and financial institutions](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/difference-between-libid-libor.asp) including Barclays, ICAP, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Deutsche Bank faced heavy fines. Punitive actions were also taken on their employees who were found to be involved in the malpractice.7 The scandal was also one of the primary reasons why LIBOR shifted from BBA administration to ICE.\n\n## Special Considerations: Phasing Out LIBOR\n\nAlthough LIBOR has been used since the 1980s, regulatory reforms have begun in recent years to reform benchmark rates and ultimately replace LIBOR as the interbank borrowing rate. It's expected that U.K. regulators will no longer require banks to publish LIBOR rates after 2021.1﻿\n\nThe new system is designed to replace the conjecture surrounding interest rates that was predominant under LIBOR and instead use actual transaction rates. The [secured overnight financing rate](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954) (SOFR) will replace LIBOR in 2023. The SOFR is also a benchmark interest rate used for dollar-denominated loans and derivative contracts. SOFR is different than LIBOR in that it's based on actual observed transactions in the U.S. Treasury market while LIBOR used estimations of borrowing rates.\n\nHowever, SOFR is likely to be used in the U.S. and the U.K. but other countries are exploring using their own version of a benchmark rate for when LIBOR is phased out.\n\n## Examples of LIBOR-Based Products and Transactions\n\nThe most straightforward example of a LIBOR-based transaction is a floating rate bond, which pays an annual interest based on LIBOR, say at LIBOR + 0.5%. As the value of LIBOR changes, the interest payment will change.\n\nLIBOR also applies to interest rate swaps—contractual agreements between two parties to exchange interest payments at a specified time. Assume Paul owns a $1 million investment that pays him a variable LIBOR-based interest rate equal to LIBOR + 1% each quarter. Since his earnings are subject to LIBOR values and are variable in nature, he wants to switch to fixed-rate interest payments. Then there is Peter, who has a similar $1 million investment, which pays him a fixed interest of 1.5% per quarter. He wishes to get a variable earning, as it may occasionally give him higher payments.\n\nBoth Paul and Peter can enter into a swap agreement, exchanging their respective interest receipts. Paul will receive the fixed 1.5% interest over his $1 million investment from Peter, which equals $15,000 while Peter receives LIBOR + 1% variable interest from Paul.\n\nIf LIBOR is 1%, then Peter will receive 2% or $20,000 from Paul. Since this figure is higher than what he owes to Paul, in net terms, Peter will get $5,000 ($20,000 - $15,000) from Paul. By next quarter, if LIBOR comes down to 0.25%, Peter will be eligible to receive 1.25% or $12,500 from Paul. In net terms, Paul will get $2,500 ($15,000 - $12,500) from Peter.\n\nSuch swaps essentially fulfill the requirement of both the transacting parties who wanted to change the type of interest receipts (fixed and floating).", "timestamp": 1654655588, "digest": "xsbjoA7ayrSWSbqu6Dwge0kPAycxeO3OFoAbq7_n6XY", "contributor": "0xc521BB7978d502B0632Dd231B50fCdC1D9995FC1"}

The idea is that everyone has a stake in the company's success and everyone should strive, at all times, to help make the [business model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp) better.\n\nMany companies have adopted the kaizen concept. Most notably, [Toyota](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/021416/how-toyota-makes-money-tm.asp) employs the kaizen philosophy within its organization and has esteemed it as one of its core values. Within its production system, Toyota encourages and empowers all employees to identify areas of potential improvement and create viable solutions.1\n\n### Fast Fact\n\n*Toyota’s process of identifying solutions is called \"kaizen blitz.\"*\n\n## Requirements for Kaizen\n\nKaizen consists of five key principles including: know your customer, let it flow, go to gemba (or 'the real place'), empower people and be transparent.2 These five principles lead to three major outcomes: elimination of waste (also referred to as [economic efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_efficiency.asp)), good housekeeping, and standardization. Ideally, kaizen becomes so ingrained in a [company's culture](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-culture.asp) that it eventually becomes natural to employees.\n\nThe kaizen concept posits that there is no perfect end and that everything can be improved upon. People must strive to evolve and innovate constantly. The basic principle of kaizen is that people who perform certain tasks and activities are the most knowledgeable about that task/activity; including them to effect change is the best strategy for improvement.3\n\nTeamwork is core to kaizen, where regular team meetings are held involving discussions about improvements, changes, and projects.\n\n## Kaizen and the PDCA Cycle\n\nImprovements generally follow the [PDCA cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pdca-cycle.asp) format, which stands for \"plan-do-check-act.\" The \"plan\" portion includes mapping out the changes so that everyone knows what to expect when teams try to solve a problem. The \"do\" means implementing the best solution to the problem. The \"check\" step involves evaluating the solution to the problem to see if it worked.\n\nWhen a company performs the \"act\" stage, it determines whether or not the solution should become a company standard or if it needs further changes. If managers decide to implement more changes, kaizen goes back to the plan step and the process starts over.\n\n## Just-in-Time Inventory Strategy\n\nOne of the key goals of kaizen is to reduce waste and increase efficiency in the production cycle. A [just-in-time (JIT)](https://www.kaizen.com/what-is-kaizen) inventory strategy allows management to minimize excess inventory by matching the delivery of raw materials from suppliers with production schedules. Also known as the Toyota Production System (TPS), for the company that popularized the strategy, JIT helps companies cut costs because manufacturers do not have to pay [inventory carrying costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carrying-costs.asp). It also reduces waste because companies are not left with extra inventory should a customer cancel or postpone an order.3\n\n[Kanban](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kanban.asp) is an inventory control system used in conjunction with a JIT strategy. It provides employees with visual cues that tell them it is time to order parts and materials as they run out. The system relies on colored cards that track production and alert employees that it's time to replenish a needed part or material. It enables employees to quickly order the correct amount of parts from the supplier and have them delivered to where they are needed in the factory. The goal of kanban is to ensure the efficient running of the factory assembly line and to prevent [bottlenecks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottleneck.asp) from occurring.", "timestamp": 1654655683, "digest": "FNvc3ptyfL7DbcY624f4j5QzXDnE6ErMriiLhT0waME", "contributor": "0xBF00F8Cb2265730d4DA0C0c982FBD987F9a0f34e"}

{"id": "rfHcV7evh3CSQgUaP3wZN1CYvuuIQ0RCN1Nj_NN-1KU", "title": "London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)", "body": "## What Is London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)?\n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a [benchmark](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans.\n\nLIBOR, which stands for London Interbank Offered Rate, serves as a globally accepted key benchmark interest rate that indicates borrowing costs between banks. The rate is calculated and will continue to be published each day by the [Intercontinental Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intercontinentalexchange.asp) (ICE), but due to recent scandals and questions around its validity as a benchmark rate, it is being phased out. According to the Federal Reserve and regulators in the UK, LIBOR will be phased out by June 30, 2023, and will be replaced by the [Secured Overnight Financing Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954) (SOFR). As part of this phase-out, LIBOR one-week and two-month USD LIBOR rates will no longer be published after Dec. 31, 2021.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* LIBOR is the benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another.\n* LIBOR is administered by the Intercontinental Exchange, which asks major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans.\n* The rate is calculated using the Waterfall Methodology, a standardized, transaction-based, data-driven, layered method.\n* LIBOR has been subject to manipulation, scandal, and methodological critique, making it less credible today as a benchmark rate.\n* LIBOR is being replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) on June 30, 2023, with phase-out of its use beginning after 2021.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:22\n\n#### London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)\n\n## Understanding LIBOR\n\nLIBOR is the average interest rate at which major global banks borrow from one another. It is based on five currencies including the U.S. dollar, the [euro](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp), the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc, and serves seven different maturities—overnight/spot next, one week, and one, two, three, six, and 12 months.1﻿\n\nThe combination of five currencies and seven maturities leads to a total of 35 different LIBOR rates calculated and reported each business day.1﻿ The most commonly quoted rate is the three-month U.S. dollar rate, usually referred to as the current LIBOR rate.\n\nEach day, ICE asks major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans. The association takes out the highest and lowest figures, then calculates the average from the remaining numbers. This is known as the trimmed average. This rate is posted each morning as the daily rate, so it's not a static figure. Once the rates for each maturity and currency are calculated and finalized, they are announced and published once a day at around 11:55 a.m. London time by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA).1﻿\n\nLIBOR is also the basis for consumer loans in countries around the world, so it impacts consumers just as much as it does financial institutions. The interest rates on various credit products such as credit cards, car loans, and adjustable-rate mortgages fluctuate based on the [interbank rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interbankrate.asp). This change in rate helps determine the ease of borrowing between banks and consumers.\n\nBut there is a downside to using the LIBOR rate. Even though lower borrowing costs may be attractive to consumers, it does also affect the returns on certain securities. Some mutual funds may be attached to LIBOR, so their yields may drop as LIBOR fluctuates.\n\n## How Is LIBOR Calculated?\n\nThe IBA has constituted a designated panel of global banks for each currency and tenor pair. For example, 16 major banks, including Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, and UBS constitute the panel for U.S. dollar LIBOR.1 Only those banks that have a significant role in the London market are considered eligible for membership on the ICE LIBOR panel, and the selection process is held annually.\n\nAs of April 2018, the IBA submitted a new proposal to strengthen the LIBOR calculation methodology. It suggested using a standardized, transaction-based, data-driven, layered method called the Waterfall Methodology for determining LIBOR.2\n\n* The first transaction-based level involves taking a [volume-weighted average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp) (VWAP) of all eligible transactions a panel bank may have assigned a higher weighting for transactions booked closer to 11:00 a.m. London time.\n* The second transaction-derived level involved taking submissions based on transaction-derived data from a panel bank if it does not have a sufficient number of eligible transactions to make a Level 1 submission.\n* The third level—expert judgment—comes into play when a panel bank fails to make a Level 1 or a Level 2 submission. It submits the rate at which it could finance itself at 11:00 a.m. London time with reference to the unsecured, wholesale funding market.\n\nThe Waterfall Methodology retains the trimmed average calculation.\n\nThe IBA calculates the LIBOR rate using a [trimmed mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trimmed_mean.asp) approach applied to all the responses received. Trimmed mean is a method of averaging, which eliminates a small specified percentage of the largest and smallest values before calculating the mean. For LIBOR, figures in the highest and lowest quartile are thrown out, and averaging is performed on the remaining numbers.3\n\n## Uses of LIBOR\n\nLIBOR is used worldwide in a wide variety of financial products. They include the following:\n\n* Standard interbank products like the forward rate agreements (FRA), interest rate swaps, interest rate [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp), [options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), and [swaptions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swaption.asp), whereby options provide buyers with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security or interest rate product\n* Commercial products like floating rate certificate of deposits and notes, variable rate mortgages, and [syndicated loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/syndicatedloan.asp), which are loans offered by a group of lenders\n* Hybrid products like [collateralized debt obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) (CDO), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), and a wide variety of accrual notes, callable notes, and perpetual notes\n* Consumer loan-related products like individual mortgages and student loans\n\nLIBOR is also used as a standard gauge of market expectation for interest rates finalized by central banks. It accounts for the liquidity premiums for various instruments traded in the money markets, as well as an indicator of the health of the overall banking system. A lot of [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) products are created, launched, and traded in reference to LIBOR. LIBOR is also used as a reference rate for other standard processes like [clearing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearing.asp), price discovery, and product valuation.\n\n## A Brief History of LIBOR\n\nThe need for a uniform measure of interest rates across financial institutions became necessary as the market for interest rate-based products began evolving during the 1980s. The British Bankers’ Association (BBA)—which represented the banking and financial services industry—set up BBA interest-settlement rates in 1984. Further streamlining led to the evolution of BBA LIBOR in 1986, which became the default standard interest rate for transacting in the interest rate- and currency-based financial dealings between financial institutions at the local and international levels.4\n\nSince then, LIBOR has undergone many changes. The major one is when [BBA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/britishba.asp) LIBOR changed to ICE LIBOR in February 2014 after the Intercontinental Exchange took over the administration.5\n\nCurrencies involved in calculating LIBOR have also changed. While new currency rates have been added, many have been removed or integrated following the introduction of the euro rates. The 2008 financial crisis saw a significant decline in the number of tenors for which LIBOR was calculated.6\n\n## LIBOR Equivalents\n\nThough LIBOR is accepted globally, there are other similar regional interest rates that are popularly followed across the globe.\n\nFor instance, Europe has the European Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Japan has the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), China has Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR), and India has the [Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mibor.asp) (MIBOR).\n\n## LIBOR Scandal of Rate Rigging\n\nWhile LIBOR has been a long-established global benchmark standard for interest rates, it has had its fair share of controversies including a major [scandal of rate rigging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor-scandal.asp). Major banks allegedly colluded to manipulate the LIBOR rates. They took traders' requests into account and submitted artificially low LIBOR rates to keep them at their preferred levels. The intention behind the alleged malpractice was to bump up traders’ profits who were holding positions in LIBOR-based financial securities.7\n\nFollowing reporting by the Wall Street Journal in 2008, major global banks, which were on the panels and contributed to the LIBOR determination process, faced regulatory scrutiny.8 It involved investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice. Similar investigations were launched in other parts of the globe including in the U.K. and Europe. Major [banks and financial institutions](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/difference-between-libid-libor.asp) including Barclays, ICAP, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Deutsche Bank faced heavy fines. Punitive actions were also taken on their employees who were found to be involved in the malpractice.7 The scandal was also one of the primary reasons why LIBOR shifted from BBA administration to ICE.\n\n## Special Considerations: Phasing Out LIBOR\n\nAlthough LIBOR has been used since the 1980s, regulatory reforms have begun in recent years to reform benchmark rates and ultimately replace LIBOR as the interbank borrowing rate. It's expected that U.K. regulators will no longer require banks to publish LIBOR rates after 2021.1﻿\n\nThe new system is designed to replace the conjecture surrounding interest rates that was predominant under LIBOR and instead use actual transaction rates. The [secured overnight financing rate](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954) (SOFR) will replace LIBOR in 2023. The SOFR is also a benchmark interest rate used for dollar-denominated loans and derivative contracts. SOFR is different than LIBOR in that it's based on actual observed transactions in the U.S. Treasury market while LIBOR used estimations of borrowing rates.\n\nHowever, SOFR is likely to be used in the U.S. and the U.K. but other countries are exploring using their own version of a benchmark rate for when LIBOR is phased out.\n\n## Examples of LIBOR-Based Products and Transactions\n\nThe most straightforward example of a LIBOR-based transaction is a floating rate bond, which pays an annual interest based on LIBOR, say at LIBOR + 0.5%. As the value of LIBOR changes, the interest payment will change.\n\nLIBOR also applies to interest rate swaps—contractual agreements between two parties to exchange interest payments at a specified time. Assume Paul owns a $1 million investment that pays him a variable LIBOR-based interest rate equal to LIBOR + 1% each quarter. Since his earnings are subject to LIBOR values and are variable in nature, he wants to switch to fixed-rate interest payments. Then there is Peter, who has a similar $1 million investment, which pays him a fixed interest of 1.5% per quarter. He wishes to get a variable earning, as it may occasionally give him higher payments.\n\nBoth Paul and Peter can enter into a swap agreement, exchanging their respective interest receipts. Paul will receive the fixed 1.5% interest over his $1 million investment from Peter, which equals $15,000 while Peter receives LIBOR + 1% variable interest from Paul.\n\nIf LIBOR is 1%, then Peter will receive 2% or $20,000 from Paul. Since this figure is higher than what he owes to Paul, in net terms, Peter will get $5,000 ($20,000 - $15,000) from Paul. By next quarter, if LIBOR comes down to 0.25%, Peter will be eligible to receive 1.25% or $12,500 from Paul. In net terms, Paul will get $2,500 ($15,000 - $12,500) from Peter.\n\nSuch swaps essentially fulfill the requirement of both the transacting parties who wanted to change the type of interest receipts (fixed and floating).", "timestamp": 1654655618, "digest": "-JQXKmwQP4FKNb1cd4f8mfqKS2t4yzoXRYQMECkwH9g", "contributor": "0xc521BB7978d502B0632Dd231B50fCdC1D9995FC1"}
{"id": "ZEWEU1nUJw8B5RcysqlCTeBhNXyHf7P9WoFDSq3IT68", "title": "Command Economy", "body": "## What Is a Command Economy?\n\nA command economy is a key aspect of a political system in which a central governmental authority dictates the levels of production that are permissible and the prices that may be charged for goods and services. Most industries are publicly owned.\n\nThe main alternative to a command economy is a free market system in which demand dictates production and prices.\n\nThe command economy is a component of a [communist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/communism.asp) political system, while a free market system exists in capitalist societies.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* In a command economy, the central government dictates the level of production of goods and controls their distribution and prices.\n* Proponents of command economies argue government control rather than private enterprise can ensure the fair distribution of goods and services.\n* In a free market system, private enterprises set production and price levels based on demand.\n\n## Understanding Command Economy\n\nCuba, North Korea, and the former Soviet Union all have command economies. China maintained a command economy until 1978 when it began its transition to a mixed economy that blends communist and capitalist elements. Its current system has been described as a socialist market economy.1\n\nThe command economy, also known as a planned economy, requires that a nation's central government own and control the means of production.\n\nPrivate ownership of land and capital is nonexistent or severely limited. Central planners set prices, control production levels, and limit or prohibit competition within the private sector. In a pure command economy, there is no private sector, as the central government owns or controls all business.\n\nIn a command economy, government officials set national economic priorities, including how and when to generate economic growth, how to allocate resources, and how to distribute the output. This often takes the form of a multi-year plan.\n\n### Arguments Against Command Economies\n\nAny capitalist would argue that command economies face at least two major problems: first is the incentive problem and second is an information vacuum among the central planners making all the decisions.\n\n**The Incentive Problem**\n\nThe incentive problem starts at the top. Policymakers, even in a command economy, are all too human. Political interest groups and the power struggles between them will dominate policymaking in a command economy even more than in capitalist economies because they are not constrained by market-based forms of discipline such as [sovereign credit ratings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-credit-rating.asp) or [capital flight](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalflight.asp).\n\nWages are set centrally for workers, and profits are eliminated as an incentive for management. There is no apparent reason to produce excellence, improve efficiency, control costs, or contribute effort beyond the minimum required to avoid official sanction.\n\nGetting ahead in a command economy requires pleasing the party bosses and having the right connections rather than maximizing shareholder value or meeting consumer demands. Corruption tends to be pervasive.\n\nThe incentive problem includes the issue known as the [tragedy of the commons](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tragedy-of-the-commons.asp) on a larger scale than is seen in capitalist societies. Resources that are commonly owned are effectively unowned. All of their users (or workers) lack any incentive to preserve them. Things such as housing developments, factories, and machinery wear out, break down, and fall apart rapidly in a command economy. \n\n **The Information Vacuum**\n\nThe problem of economic calculation in a command economy was first described by [Austrian economists](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/austrian-school-of-economics.asp) Ludwig von Mises and F. A. Hayek. Central planners must somehow calculate how much of every product and service should be produced and delivered.\n\nIn a free market system, this is determined in a decentralized manner through the interaction of [supply and demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp). Consumers shape demand by the products and services they buy or don't buy. Producers respond by creating more of the products and services that consumers demand.\n\nMoreover, all of these factors are quantifiable. At every step of the supply chain, someone is keeping count of the number of avocados, pairs of blue jeans, and lug wrenches that are in demand out there.\n\nIn a command economy, central planners should, at least initially, have a grasp on the basic life-or-death needs of the population in terms of food, clothing, and shelter. But without the forces of supply and demand to guide them, they have no rational method to align the production and distribution of goods with consumer wants and preferences.\n\nOver time, the incentive and economic calculation problems of a command economy mean that resources and capital goods are wasted, and the society is impoverished.\n\n## Arguments in Favor of Command Economies\n\nProponents of command economies argue that they allocate resources to maximize [social welfare](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-welfare-system.asp), unlike in free-market economies, where this goal is secondary to maximizing private profit.\n\nCommand economies may have better control of employment levels than free-market economies. They can create jobs to put people to work when necessary, even in the absence of a legitimate need.\n\nLastly, command economies are seen as better able to take decisive, coordinated action in the face of a national emergency or crisis such as a war or natural disaster. Although, even market-based societies may curtail property rights and greatly expand the emergency powers of their central governments during such events, at least temporarily.\n\n## What Are the Characteristics of a Command Economy?\n\nCommand economies are controlled from the top by government planners. In general, this includes:\n\n \n \n\n* Public ownership of major industries.\n* Government control of production levels and distribution quotas.\n* Government control of prices and salaries.\n\n \n \n\nMonopolies are common in command economies as they are considered necessary to meet the goals of the national economy.\n\n## How Does a Command Economy Differ from a Free-Market Economy?\n\nIn a free-market economy, private enterprises determine their levels of production in response to the law of supply and demand.\n\n \n \n\nIn a command economy, the decision is dictated by government.\n\n \n \n\nFew free-market economies today operate entirely on the principle of laissez-faire. A government may use public policies and regulations to encourage the production of a product, such as fuel-efficient cars.\n\n \n \n\nAnd some command economies have loosened their control. China's economic boom did not begin until it created its own blend of socialist ideology and capitalist enterprise.2\n\n \n \n\n## How Do Central Plans Work in a Command Economy?\n\nCommunist nations with command economies are prone to introducing multi-year plans that are expected to result in improved conditions for all its people. China has had no fewer than 14 five-year plans, with the current one ending in 2025.3\n\n \n \n\nCentral plans generally set goals for each industry and establish strategies for every sector. Industries are required to participate in government objectives such as reducing carbon emissions or revitalizing rural economies.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssvf8YMLi9vb1K9HGnFdzz7v9v2f5jq-izM3Fq2-jgX-JJSUZ7R6isZfAKFOcLJA1Kd8OxDIs66abrqA0gtxHxQtw8VLf9LkspK3n9PXx-KQRhGbICKxOISJpunB5DKwkvKXzMqQxNdJkpFaiVQ4ryv2hOkd6E678pGc0ExmFnK3E7Z3Vi0FyZQnWob3zJ_KKwiePtGfY19WsBEVM-ENb27zKXj_uDFkDD_J_aKY5OezsCRHVAFxtTKJlhSEUN5kNrmpiqe4V9bEQtE-SDhMi8ITdu01YR20pS3x_nR9LOeawCu49k3adyKPfWy8XZyoZoJUkHAsx8jJQ&sig=Cg0ArKJSzHWuyfACkseDEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssvf8YMLi9vb1K9HGnFdzz7v9v2f5jq-izM3Fq2-jgX-JJSUZ7R6isZfAKFOcLJA1Kd8OxDIs66abrqA0gtxHxQtw8VLf9LkspK3n9PXx-KQRhGbICKxOISJpunB5DKwkvKXzMqQxNdJkpFaiVQ4ryv2hOkd6E678pGc0ExmFnK3E7Z3Vi0FyZQnWob3zJ_KKwiePtGfY19WsBEVM-ENb27zKXj_uDFkDD_J_aKY5OezsCRHVAFxtTKJlhSEUN5kNrmpiqe4V9bEQtE-SDhMi8ITdu01YR20pS3x_nR9LOeawCu49k3adyKPfWy8XZyoZoJUkHAsx8jJQ&sig=Cg0ArKJSzHWuyfACkseDEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

You assume everything will become affordable because of the recession, and you have an opportunity to buy things you cannot afford.\n\nThe reality is you probably won't be able to afford it even if there is a recession. Everything will become more expensive than ever 😂.\n\nIt is an economic show where the rich are shuffling their shopping cart, and the poor watch it from different angles.\n\nIt is all about debts that the rich accumulated so much that they cannot afford to have more at the same speed, so deflating a bit of debt is a healthy way to continue keeping pace to have more obligations in the future.\n\nAnd the rich are not required to pay off debts.\n\nDid you notice that 😢?\n\nWait, you may wonder why the rich get away from debts?

{"id": "l2wKXlqWqzu3afauNYmiFlGkgIBFIWLfvudWJv4-Ab0", "title": "Comparative Advantage", "body": "## What Is Comparative Advantage?\n\nComparative advantage is an economy's ability to produce a particular good or service at a lower [opportunity cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp) than its trading partners. Comparative advantage is used to explain why companies, countries, or individuals can benefit from trade.\n\nWhen used to describe international trade, comparative advantage refers to the products that a country can produce more cheaply or easily than other countries. While this usually illustrates the benefits of trade, some contemporary economists now acknowledge that focusing only on comparative advantages can result in exploitation and depletion of the country's resources.\n\nThe law of comparative advantage is popularly attributed to English political economist [David Ricardo](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/david-ricardo.asp) and his book “On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation” written in 1817, although it is likely that Ricardo's mentor, James Mill, originated the analysis.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Comparative advantage is an economy's ability to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners.\n* The theory of comparative advantage introduces opportunity cost as a factor for analysis in choosing between different options for production.\n* Comparative advantage suggests that countries will engage in trade with one another, exporting the goods that they have a relative advantage in.\n* There are downsides to focusing only on a country's comparative advantages, which can exploit the country's labor and natural resources.\n* Absolute advantage refers to the uncontested superiority of a country to produce a particular good better.\n\n#### Explaining Comparative Advantage\n\n## Understanding Comparative Advantage\n\nComparative advantage is one of the most important concepts in economic theory and a fundamental tenet of the argument that all actors, at all times, can mutually benefit from cooperation and voluntary trade. It is also a foundational principle in the theory of [international trade](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/).\n\nThe key to understanding comparative advantage is a solid grasp of opportunity cost. Put simply, an opportunity cost is a potential benefit that someone loses out on when selecting a particular option over another.\n\nIn the case of comparative advantage, the opportunity cost (that is to say, the potential benefit that has been forfeited) for one company is lower than that of another. The company with the lower opportunity cost, and thus the smallest potential benefit which was lost, holds this type of advantage.\n\nAnother way to think of comparative advantage is as the best option given a trade-off. If you're comparing two different options, each of which has a trade-off (some benefits as well as some disadvantages), the one with the best overall package is the one with the comparative advantage.\n\n## Diversity of Skills\n\nPeople learn their comparative advantages through [wages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/031115/salary-vs-hourly-how-benefits-laws-differ.asp). This drives people into those jobs that they are comparatively best at. If a skilled mathematician earns more money as an engineer than as a teacher, they and everyone they trade with are better off when they practice engineering.\n\nWider gaps in opportunity costs allow for higher levels of value production by organizing labor more efficiently. The greater the diversity in people and their skills, the greater the opportunity for beneficial trade through comparative advantage.\n\nAs an example, consider a famous athlete like Michael Jordan. As a renowned basketball and baseball star, Michael Jordan is an exceptional athlete whose physical abilities surpass those of most other individuals. Michael Jordan would likely be able to, say, paint his house quickly, owing to his abilities as well as his impressive height.\n\nHypothetically, say that [Michael Jordan](https://www.investopedia.com/rich-and-powerful-4689827) could paint his house in eight hours. In those same eight hours, though, he could also take part in the filming of a television commercial which would earn him $50,000. By contrast, Jordan's neighbor Joe could paint the house in 10 hours. In that same period of time, he could work at a fast food restaurant and earn $100.\n\nIn this example, Joe has a comparative advantage, even though Michael Jordan could paint the house faster and better. The best trade would be for Michael Jordan to film a television commercial and pay Joe to paint his house. So long as Michael Jordan makes the expected $50,000 and Joe earns more than $100, the trade is a winner. Owing to their diversity of skills, Michael Jordan and Joe would likely find this to be the best arrangement for their mutual benefit.\n\n## Comparative Advantage vs. Absolute Advantage\n\nComparative advantage is contrasted with [absolute advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absoluteadvantage.asp). Absolute advantage refers to the ability to produce more or better goods and services than somebody else. Comparative advantage refers to the ability to produce goods and services at a lower opportunity cost, not necessarily at a greater volume or quality.\n\nComparative advantage is a key insight that trade will still occur even if one country has an absolute advantage in all products.\n\nTo see the difference, consider an attorney and their secretary. The attorney is better at producing legal services than the secretary and is also a faster typist and organizer. In this case, the attorney has an absolute advantage in both the production of legal services and secretarial work.\n\nNevertheless, they benefit from trade thanks to their comparative advantages and disadvantages. Suppose the attorney produces $175 per hour in legal services and $25 per hour in secretarial duties. The secretary can produce $0 in legal services and $20 in secretarial duties in an hour. Here, the role of opportunity cost is crucial.\n\nTo produce $25 in income from secretarial work, the attorney must lose $175 in income by not practicing law. Their opportunity cost of secretarial work is high. They are better off by producing an hour's worth of legal services and hiring the secretary to type and organize. The secretary is much better off typing and organizing for the attorney; their opportunity cost of doing so is low. It’s where their comparative advantage lies.\n\n## Comparative Advantage vs. Competitive Advantage\n\n[Competitive advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp) refers to a company, economy, country, or individual's ability to provide a stronger value to consumers as compared with its competitors. It is similar to, but distinct from, comparative advantage.\n\nIn order to assume a competitive advantage over others in the same field or area, it's necessary to accomplish at least one of three things: the company should be the low-cost provider of its goods or services, it should offer superior goods or services than its competitors, and/or it should focus on a particular segment of the consumer pool.\n\n## Comparative Advantage in International Trade\n\nDavid Ricardo famously showed how England and Portugal both benefit by specializing and trading according to their comparative advantages. In this case, Portugal was able to make wine at a low cost, while England was able to cheaply manufacture cloth. Ricardo predicted that each country would eventually recognize these facts and stop attempting to make the product that was more costly to generate.\n\nIndeed, as time went on, England stopped producing wine, and Portugal stopped manufacturing cloth. Both countries saw that it was to their advantage to stop their efforts at producing these items at home and, instead, to trade with each other in order to acquire them.\n\n### \n\n*Comparative advantage is closely associated with free trade, which is seen as beneficial, whereas tariffs closely correspond to restricted trade and a zero-sum game.*\n\nA contemporary example: China’s comparative advantage with the United States is in the form of cheap labor. Chinese workers produce simple consumer goods at a much lower opportunity cost. The United States’ comparative advantage is in specialized, capital-intensive labor. American workers produce sophisticated goods or investment opportunities at lower opportunity costs. Specializing and trading along these lines benefit each.\n\nThe theory of comparative advantage helps to explain why [protectionism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp) is typically unsuccessful. Adherents to this analytical approach believe that countries engaged in international trade will have already worked toward finding partners with comparative advantages.\n\nIf a country removes itself from an international trade agreement, if a government imposes [tariffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp), and so on, it may produce a local benefit in the form of new jobs and industry. However, this is not a long-term solution to a trade problem. Eventually, that country will be at a disadvantage relative to its neighbors: countries that were already better able to produce these items at a lower opportunity cost.\n\nThe classical understanding of comparative advantage does not account for certain disadvantages that come from over-specialization. For example, an agricultural country that focuses on cash crops, and relies on the world market for food, could find itself vulnerable to global price shocks.\n\n## Criticisms of Comparative Advantage\n\nWhy doesn't the world have open trading between countries? When there is [free trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free-trade.asp), why do some countries remain poor at the expense of others? Perhaps comparative advantage does not work as suggested. There are many reasons this could be the case, but the most influential is something that economists call [rent seeking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp). Rent seeking occurs when one group organizes and lobbies the government to protect its interests.\n\nSay, for example, the producers of American shoes understand and agree with the free-trade argument but they also know that their narrow interests would be negatively impacted by cheaper foreign shoes. Even if laborers would be most productive by switching from making shoes to making computers, nobody in the shoe industry wants to lose their job or see profits decrease in the short run.\n\nThis desire leads the shoemakers to lobby for, say, special [tax breaks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-break.asp) for their products and/or extra duties (or even outright bans) on foreign footwear. Appeals to save American jobs and preserve a time-honored American craft abound, even though, in the long run, American laborers would be made relatively less productive and American consumers relatively poorer by such protectionist tactics.\n\n## Downside of Comparative Advantage\n\nIn international trade, the law of comparative advantage is often used to justify [globalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalization.asp), since countries can have higher material outcomes by producing only goods where they have a comparative advantage, and trading those goods with other countries. Countries like China and South Korea have made major productivity gains by specializing their economies in certain export-focused industries, where they had a comparative advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, over-specialization also has [negative effects](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalization.asp), especially for developing countries. While free trade allows developed countries to access cheap industrial labor, it also has high human costs due to the exploitation of local workforces.\n\nBy offshoring manufacturing to countries with less stringent labor laws, companies can benefit from child labor and coercive employment practices that are illegal in their home countries. Many rising economies, such as China and India, are also grappling with the environmental consequences of their manufacturing industries.1\n\nLikewise, an agricultural country that focuses only on certain export crops may find itself suffering from soil depletion and destruction of its natural resources, as well as harm to indigenous peoples. Moreover, there are also strategic disadvantages to over-specialization, since that country would find itself dependent on global food prices.2\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nComparative advantage is one of the most important concepts in economics. In classical economics, this idea explains why people, countries, and businesses can experience greater collective benefits through trade and exchange than they can produce alone. However, contemporary economists have also pointed out that these gains can be one-sided, or result in exploitation of the weaker parties. \n \n\n## Who Developed the Law of Comparative Advantage?\n\nThe law of comparative advantage is usually attributed to David Ricardo, who described the theory in \"On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,\" published in 1817. However, the idea of comparative advantage may have originated with Ricardo's mentor, James Mill, who also wrote on the subject.\n\n## How Do You Calculate Comparative Advantage?\n\nComparative advantage is usually measured in opportunity costs, or the value of the goods that could be produced with the same resources. This is then compared with the opportunity costs of another economic actor to produce the same goods. \n For example, if Factory A can make 100 pairs of shoes with the same resources it takes to make 500 belts, then each pair of shoes has an opportunity cost of five belts. If competitor factory B, can make three belts with the resources it takes to make one pair of shoes, then factory A has a comparative advantage in making belts, and factory B has a comparative advantage in making shoes. \n \n\n## What Is an Example of Comparative Advantage?\n\nAn interesting example of comparative advantages often arises for high-powered executives, who may consider hiring an assistant to answer their emails and perform certain secretarial functions. The executive may even better at performing these duties than their assistant—but the time they spend doing secretarial work could be spent more profitably by doing executive work. Likewise, even if the assistant is mediocre at secretarial work, they would likely be even more ill-suited for executive work. Together, they are ultimately more productive if they focus on their comparative advantages.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvLgTcmmoTcDGdZosCzlyCOlPUqCzpV0oJos9HukE8m3khjmiFkHVQih_1dD4C-WyQMtVkdzlSNoNiTvhvelx14IFImF-evPPSTapx42oSZxGdv8IW5IjGSs7JJPAbzSyaN482TIO20_C5cQGBxyiZ6YeClGL1DX9MK5wFYWa5icg6v5Ihs1ujRAUIYz4ZgvPntyKrri6cRNEvOpEPLelgymEU_penBVev5pMbYPt6s4El-ad2zl8qMZSU5jgFGJq19wkvrdq_LmMUvrwmInkm_kEaAMxxC9oD4gdlDL8YxG2pTymAnd4MWbmoiTCxepRTBEz189ojgdg_n&sig=Cg0ArKJSzGWmq2U90HE0EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvLgTcmmoTcDGdZosCzlyCOlPUqCzpV0oJos9HukE8m3khjmiFkHVQih_1dD4C-WyQMtVkdzlSNoNiTvhvelx14IFImF-evPPSTapx42oSZxGdv8IW5IjGSs7JJPAbzSyaN482TIO20_C5cQGBxyiZ6YeClGL1DX9MK5wFYWa5icg6v5Ihs1ujRAUIYz4ZgvPntyKrri6cRNEvOpEPLelgymEU_penBVev5pMbYPt6s4El-ad2zl8qMZSU5jgFGJq19wkvrdq_LmMUvrwmInkm_kEaAMxxC9oD4gdlDL8YxG2pTymAnd4MWbmoiTCxepRTBEz189ojgdg_n&sig=Cg0ArKJSzGWmq2U90HE0EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "NrQu-NLipulY_r21eZybz9ZCjZabaWm7hbl9giE7VSQ", "title": "The Kyoto Protocol", "body": "## What Is the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement that aimed to reduce [carbon dioxide](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092915/5-countries-produce-most-carbon-dioxide-co2.asp) (CO2) emissions and the presence of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. The essential tenet of the Kyoto Protocol was that industrialized nations needed to lessen the amount of their CO2 emissions.1\n\nThe protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan in 1997, when greenhouse gases were rapidly threatening our climate, life on the earth, and the planet.1 Today, the Kyoto Protocol lives on in other forms, and its issues are still being discussed.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement that called for industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions significantly.\n* Other accords, like the Doha Amendment and the Paris Climate Agreement, have also tried to curb the global-warming crisis.\n* Talks begun by the Kyoto Protocol continue in 2021 and are extremely complicated, involving politics, money, and lack of consensus.\n* The U.S. withdrew from the agreement on the grounds that the mandate was unfair and would hurt the U.S. economy.\n* The Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, which replaced the Kyoto Protocol, includes commitments from all major GHG-emitting countries to reduce their climate-altering pollution.\n\n## The Kyoto Protocol Explained\n\n### Background\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol mandated that industrialized nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions at a time when the threat of global warming was growing rapidly. The Protocol was linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It was adopted in Kyoto, Japan on December 11, 1997, and became international law on February 16, 2005.1﻿\n\nCountries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol were assigned maximum carbon emission levels for specific periods and participated in [carbon credit trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbontrade.asp). If a country emitted more than its assigned limit, then it would be penalized by receiving a lower emissions limit in the following period.\n\n### Major Tenets\n\nDeveloped, industrialized countries made a promise under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their annual [hydrocarbon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hydrocarbon.asp) emissions by an average of 5.2% by the year 2012. This number would represent about 29% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTargets depended on the individual country. As a result, each nation had a different target to meet by that year.\n\nMembers of the [European Union](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-community.asp) (EU) pledged to cut emissions by 8%, while the U.S. and Canada promised to reduce their emissions by 7% and 6%, respectively, by 2012.2\n\n### $100 billion\n\n*The amount of the Kyoto Protocol fund that was meant to aid developing countries in selecting non-greenhouse-emitting industrialized processes and technologies.3*\n\n### Responsibilities of Developed Versus Developing Nations\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol recognized that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of [GHG emissions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/030816/top-4-oil-companies-protect-environment-xom-sun.asp) in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity. As such, the protocol placed a heavier burden on developed nations than less-developed nations.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol mandated that 37 industrialized nations plus the EU cut their GHG emissions. Developing nations were asked to comply voluntarily, and more than 100 developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from the Kyoto agreement altogether.\n\n### A Particular Function for Developing Countries\n\nThe protocol separated countries into two groups: Annex I contained developed nations, and Non-Annex I referred to developing countries. The protocol placed emission limitations on Annex I countries only. Non-Annex I nations participated by investing in projects designed to lower emissions in their countries.\n\nFor these projects, developing countries earned [carbon credits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbon_credit.asp), which they could trade or sell to developed countries, allowing the developed nations a higher level of maximum carbon emissions for that period. In effect, this function helped the developed countries to continue emitting GHG vigorously.\n\n### The United States' Involvement\n\nThe United States, which had ratified the original Kyoto agreement, dropped out of the protocol in 2001. The U.S. believed that the agreement was unfair because it called only for industrialized nations to limit emissions reductions, and it felt that doing so would hurt the U.S. economy.4\n\n## The Kyoto Protocol Ended in 2012, Effectively Half-Baked\n\nGlobal emissions were still on the rise by 2005, the year the Kyoto Protocol became international law—even though it was adopted in 1997. Things seemed to go well for many countries, including those in the EU. They planned to meet or exceed their targets under the agreement by 2011. But others continued to fall short.\n\nThe United States and China—two of the world's biggest emitters—produced enough greenhouse gases to mitigate any of the progress made by nations who met their targets. In fact, there was an increase of about 40% in emissions globally between 1990 and 2009.\n\n### The Doha Amendment Extended Kyoto Protocol to 2020\n\nIn December 2012, after the first commitment period of the Protocol ended, parties to the Kyoto Protocol met in Doha, Qatar, to adopt an amendment to the original Kyoto agreement. This so-called Doha Amendment added new emission-reduction targets for the second commitment period, 2012–2020, for participating countries.5\n\nThe Doha Amendment had a short life. In 2015, at the sustainable development summit held in Paris, all UNFCCC participants signed yet another pact, the [Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paris-agreementcop21.asp), which effectively replaced the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n### The Paris Climate Agreement\n\nThe Paris Climate Agreement is a landmark environmental pact that was adopted by nearly every nation in 2015 to [address climate change](https://www.investopedia.com/biden-s-plan-for-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2050-5208175) and its negative effects. The agreement includes commitments from all major GHG-emitting countries to cut their climate-altering pollution and to strengthen those commitments over time.6\n\n### \n\n*Every five years, countries engage in the Global Stocktake, which is an assessment of their progress under the Paris Climate Agreement.*\n\nA major directive of the deal calls for reducing global GHG emissions to limit the earth's temperature increase in this century to 2 degrees (preferring a 1.5-degree increase) Celsius above preindustrial levels. The Paris Agreement also provides a way for developed nations to assist developing nations in their efforts to adapt climate control, and it creates a framework for monitoring and reporting countries’ climate goals [transparently](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transparency.asp).7\n\n## The Kyoto Protocol Today\n\nIn 2016, when the Paris Climate Agreement went into force, the United States was one of the principal drivers of the agreement, and President Obama hailed it as “a tribute to American leadership.”8\n\nAs a candidate for president at that time, Donald Trump criticized the agreement as a bad deal for the American people and pledged to withdraw the United States if elected. In 2017, then-President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, saying that it would undermine the U.S. economy.\n\nThe former president did not begin the formal withdrawal process until Nov. 4, 2019.9 The U.S. formally withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the 2020 presidential election, in which Donald Trump lost his reelection bid to Joseph Biden.10\n\nOn January 20, 2021, his first day in office, President Biden began the process of rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, which officially took effect on Feb. 19, 2021.11\n\n### A Complicated Stalemate\n\nIn 2021, the dialogue is still alive but has turned into a complex quagmire involving politics, money, lack of leadership, lack of consensus, and bureaucracy. Today, despite myriad plans and some actions, solutions to the problems of GHG emissions and global warming have not been implemented.\n\nAlmost all scientists who study the atmosphere now believe that global warming is primarily the result of human action. Logically then, what humans have caused by their behavior should be able to be remedied by humans changing their behavior. It is frustrating to many that cohesive action to deal with the human-made global climate crisis has yet to happen.\n\n### Remember the Internet\n\nIt is critical that we remain convinced that we can, in fact, resolve these issues so crucial to our survival. We humans have already solved huge problems in numerous fields via technical innovation that led to radically new solutions.\n\nInterestingly, if anyone had suggested in 1958 that our own Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which oversees the development of advanced technologies for use by the U.S. military, would lead the world in creating the Internet—a system that could \"connect every person and thing with every other person and thing on the planet instantly and at zero cost\"—they might have been laughed off the stage, or worse.\n\n## What Is the Primary Purpose of the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was an agreement among developed nations to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and greenhouse gases (GHG).\n\n## Why Didn’t the U.S. Sign the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nThe United States backed out of the Kyoto Protocol agreement in 2001 on the basis that it unfairly burdened developed nations. The treaty called only for developed nations to reduce emissions, which the U.S. believed would unfairly stifle its economy.12\n\n## What Special Problems Do Developing Nations Face With Such Treaties As the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nDeveloping countries were not mandated to act under the agreement, and volunteering to reduce emissions under it would create large costs that they were either incapable of incurring or unwilling to incur.\n\n## What Sorts of Emissions Is the Kyoto Protocol Built to Curb?\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was built to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas emissions.", "timestamp": 1654655883, "digest": "tvq6p7Gv6K3x4NAn97yakPPSykwKx11mtVpRlv3oago", "contributor": "0x9a9f36B3d77544928742739B3114A78d23850C78"}
{"id": "-PV3PVQlg92QgP6d3JK2pFrvmA_uDWc4TCyhd9uG_V4", "title": "Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)", "body": "## What Is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?\n\nThe compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the [rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) (RoR) that would be required for an investment to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, assuming the profits were reinvested at the end of each period of the investment’s life span.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for anything that can rise or fall in value over time.\n* Investors can compare the CAGR of two alternatives to evaluate how well one stock performed against other stocks in a peer group or a market index.\n* The CAGR does not reflect investment risk.\n\n## Formula and Calculation of the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)\n\n\\\\begin{aligned}&CAGR= \\\\left ( \\\\frac{EV}{BV} \\\\right ) ^{\\\\frac{1}{n}}-1\\\\times 100\\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&EV = \\\\text{Ending value}\\\\\\\\&BV = \\\\text{Beginning value}\\\\\\\\&n = \\\\text{Number of years}\\\\end{aligned}​*CAGR*=(*BVEV*​)*n*1​−1×100where:*EV*=Ending value*BV*=Beginning value*n*=Number of years​\n\nTo calculate the CAGR of an investment:\n\n1. Divide the value of an investment at the end of the period by its value at the beginning of that period.\n2. Raise the result to an exponent of one divided by the number of years.\n3. Subtract one from the subsequent result.\n4. Multiply by 100 to convert the answer into a percentage.\n\n## What the CAGR Can Tell You\n\nThe compound annual growth rate isn’t a true return rate, but rather a representational figure. It is essentially a number that describes the rate at which an investment would have grown if it had grown at the same rate every year and the profits were reinvested at the end of each year.\n\nIn reality, this sort of performance is unlikely. However, the CAGR can be used to smooth returns so that they may be more easily understood compared to alternative methods.\n\n## Example of How to Use CAGR\n\nImagine you invested $10,000 in a portfolio with the returns outlined below:\n\n* From Jan. 1, 2018, to Jan. 1, 2019, your portfolio grew to $13,000 (or 30% in year one).\n* On Jan. 1, 2020, the portfolio was $14,000 (or 7.69% from January 2019 to January 2020).\n* On Jan. 1, 2021, the portfolio ended with $19,000 (or 35.71% from January 2020 to January 2021).\n\nWe can see that on an annual basis, the year-to-year growth rates of the investment portfolio were quite different as shown in the parentheses.\n\nOn the other hand, the compound annual growth rate smooths the investment’s performance and ignores the fact that 2018 and 2020 were vastly different from 2019. The CAGR over that period was 23.86% and can be calculated as follows:\n\nCAGR=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\$19,000}{\\\\$10,000}\\\\right )^{\\\\frac{1}{3}}-1\\\\times100=23.86\\\\%*CAGR*=($10,000$19,000​)31​−1×100=23.86%\n\nThe CAGR of 23.86% over the three-year investment period can help an investor compare alternatives for their capital or make forecasts of future values. For example, imagine an investor is comparing the performance of two uncorrelated investments.\n\nIn any given year during the period, one investment may be rising while the other falls. This could be the case when comparing high-yield [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) to [stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp), or a real estate investment to emerging markets. Using CAGR would smooth the annual return over the period so the two alternatives would be easier to compare.\n\nAs another example, let’s say an investor bought 55 shares of Amazon.com ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)) stock in December 2017 at $1,180 per share, for a total investment of $64,900. After three years, in December 2020, the stock has risen to $3,200 per share, and the investor’s investment is now worth $176,000.1 What is the CAGR?\n\nUsing the CAGR formula, we know that we need the:\n\n* Ending Balance: $176,000\n* Beginning Balance: $64,900\n* Number of Years: 3\n\nSo to calculate the CAGR for this simple example, we would enter that data into the formula as follows: \\[($176,000 / $64,900) ^ (1/3)\\] - 1 = 39.5%.\n\n## Additional CAGR Uses\n\nThe CAGR can be used to calculate the average growth of a single investment. As we saw in our example above, due to market [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp), the year-to-year growth of an investment will likely appear erratic and uneven.\n\nFor example, an investment may increase in value by 8% in one year, decrease in value by -2% the following year, and increase in value by 5% in the next. CAGR helps smooth returns when growth rates are expected to be volatile and inconsistent.\n\n### Comparing Investments\n\nThe CAGR can be used to compare different investment types with one another. For example, suppose that in 2015, an investor placed $10,000 into an account for five years with a fixed annual [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) of 1% and another $10,000 into a stock [mutual fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp). The rate of return in the stock fund will be uneven over the next few years, so a comparison between the two investments would be difficult.\n\nAssume that at the end of the five-year period, the savings account’s balance is $10,510.10 and, although the other investment has grown unevenly, the ending balance in the stock fund was $15,348.52. Using the CAGR to compare the two investments can help an investor understand the difference in returns:\n\n\\\\text{Savings Account CAGR} =\\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\$ 10,510.10}{\\\\$ 10,000} \\\\right )^{\\\\frac{1}{5}}-1 \\\\times 100= 1.00\\\\%Savings Account CAGR=($10,000$10,510.10​)51​−1×100=1.00%\n\nAnd:\n\n\\\\text{Stock fund CAGR} =\\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\$ 15,348.52}{\\\\$ 10,000} \\\\right )^{\\\\frac{1}{5}}-1 \\\\times 100= 8.95\\\\%Stock fund CAGR=($10,000$15,348.52​)51​−1×100=8.95%\n\nOn the surface, the stock fund may look like a better investment, with nearly nine times the return of the savings account. On the other hand, one of the drawbacks of the CAGR is that by smoothing the returns, The CAGR cannot tell an investor how volatile or risky the stock fund was.\n\n### Track Performance\n\nThe CAGR can also be used to track the performance of various business measures of one or multiple companies alongside one another. For example, over a five-year period, Big-Sale Stores’ market share CAGR was 1.82%, but its customer satisfaction CAGR over the same period was -0.58%. In this way, comparing the CAGRs of measures within a company reveals strengths and weaknesses.\n\n### Detect Weaknesses and Strengths\n\nComparing the CAGRs of business activities across similar companies will help evaluate competitive weaknesses and strengths. For example, Big-Sale’s customer satisfaction CAGR might not seem so low compared with SuperFast Cable’s customer satisfaction CAGR of -6.31% during the same period.\n\n## How Investors Use the CAGR\n\nUnderstanding the formula used to calculate CAGR is an introduction to many other ways that investors evaluate past returns or estimate future profits. The formula can be manipulated algebraically into a formula to find the present value or future value of money, or to calculate a [hurdle rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hurdlerate.asp) of return.\n\nFor example, imagine that an investor knows that they need $50,000 for a child’s college education in 18 years and they have $15,000 to invest today. How much does the average rate of return need to be to reach that objective? The CAGR calculation can be used to find the answer to this question as follows:\n\n\\\\text{Required Return} =\\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\$ 50,000}{\\\\$ 15,000} \\\\right )^{\\\\frac{1}{18}}-1 \\\\times 100= 6.90\\\\%Required Return=($15,000$50,000​)181​−1×100=6.90%\n\nThis version of the CAGR formula is just a rearranged [present value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) and [future value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurevalue.asp) equation. For example, if an investor knew that they needed $50,000 and they felt it was reasonable to expect an 8% annual return on their investment, they could use this formula to find out how much they needed to invest to meet their goal.\n\n## Modifying the CAGR Formula\n\nAn investment is rarely made on the first day of the year and then sold on the last day of the year. Imagine an investor who wants to evaluate the CAGR of a $10,000 investment that was entered on June 1, 2013, and sold for $16,897.14 on Sept. 9, 2018.\n\nBefore the CAGR calculation can be performed, the investor will need to know the fractional remainder of the holding period. They held the position for 213 days in 2013, a full year in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, and 251 days in 2018. This investment was held for 5.271 years, which is calculated by the following:\n\n* 2013 = 213 days\n* 2014 = 365\n* 2015 = 365\n* 2016 = 365\n* 2017 = 365\n* 2018 = 251\n\nThe total number of days that the investment was held was 1,924 days. To calculate the number of years, divide the total number of days by 365 (1,924/365), which equals 5.271 years.\n\nThe total number of years that the investment was held can be placed in the denominator of the exponent inside CAGR’s formula as follows:\n\n\\\\text{Investment CAGR} =\\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\$ 16,897.14}{\\\\$ 10,000} \\\\right )^{\\\\frac{1}{5.271}}-1 \\\\times 100= 10.46\\\\%Investment CAGR=($10,000$16,897.14​)5.2711​−1×100=10.46%\n\n## Smooth Rate of Growth Limitation\n\nThe most important limitation of the CAGR is that because it calculates a smoothed rate of growth over a period, it ignores volatility and implies that the growth during that time was steady. Returns on investments are uneven over time, except bonds that are held to maturity, deposits, and similar investments.\n\nAlso, the CAGR does not account for when an investor adds funds to a portfolio or withdraws funds from the portfolio over the period being measured.\n\nFor example, if an investor had a portfolio for five years and injected funds into the portfolio during the five-year period, then the CAGR would be inflated. The CAGR would calculate the rate of return based on the beginning and ending balances over the five years, and would essentially count the deposited funds as part of the annual growth rate, which would be inaccurate.\n\n## Other CAGR Limitations\n\nBesides the smoothed rate of growth, the CAGR has other limitations. A second limitation when assessing investments is that no matter how steady the growth of a company or investment has been in the past, investors cannot assume that the rate will remain the same in the future. The shorter the time frame used in the analysis, the less likely it will be for the realized CAGR to meet the expected CAGR when relying on historical results.\n\nA third limitation of the CAGR is a limitation of representation. Say that an investment fund was worth $100,000 in 2016, $71,000 in 2017, $44,000 in 2018, $81,000 in 2019, and $126,000 in 2020. If the fund managers represented in 2021 that their CAGR was a whopping 42.01% over the past three years, they would be technically correct. They would, however, be omitting some very important information about the fund’s history, including the fact that the fund’s CAGR over the past five years was a modest 4.73%.\n\n## CAGR vs. IRR\n\nThe CAGR measures the return on an investment over a certain period of time. The [internal rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp) (IRR) also measures investment performance but is more flexible than the CAGR.\n\nThe most important distinction is that the CAGR is straightforward enough that it can be calculated by hand. In contrast, more complicated investments and projects, or those that have many different cash inflows and outflows, are best evaluated using IRR. To back into the IRR, a financial calculator, Excel, or portfolio accounting system is ideal.\n\nThose interested in learning more about CAGR and other financial topics may want to consider enrolling in one of the [best investing courses](https://www.investopedia.com/best-investing-courses-4783334) currently available. \n \n\n## What Is an Example of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?\n\nThe CAGR is a measurement used by investors to calculate the rate at which a quantity grew over time. The word “compound” denotes the fact that the CAGR takes into account the effects of compounding, or reinvestment, over time. For example, suppose you have a company with revenue that grew from $3 million to $30 million over a span of 10 years. In that scenario, the CAGR would be approximately 25.89%.\n\n## What Is Considered a Good CAGR?\n\nWhat counts as a good CAGR will depend on the context. But generally speaking, investors will evaluate this by thinking about their opportunity cost as well as the riskiness of the investment. For example, if a company grew by 25% in an industry with an average CAGR closer to 30%, then its results might seem lackluster by comparison. But if the industry-wide growth rates were lower, such as 10% or 15%, then its CAGR might be very impressive.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between the CAGR and a Growth rate?\n\nThe main difference between the CAGR and a growth rate is that the CAGR assumes the growth rate was repeated, or “compounded,” each year, whereas a traditional growth rate does not. Many investors prefer the CAGR because it smooths out the volatile nature of year-by-year growth rates. For instance, even a highly profitable and successful company will likely have several years of poor performance during its life. These bad years could have a large effect on individual years’ growth rates but would have a relatively small impact on the company’s CAGR.\n\n## Can the CAGR be Negative?\n\nYes. A negative CAGR would indicate losses over time rather than gains.\n\n## What Is Risk-Adjusted CAGR?\n\nTo compare the performance and risk characteristics among various investment alternatives, investors can use a risk-adjusted CAGR. A simple method for calculating a risk-adjusted CAGR is to multiply the CAGR by one minus the investment’s [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp). If the standard deviation (i.e., its risk) is zero, then the risk-adjusted CAGR is unaffected. The larger the standard deviation, the lower the risk-adjusted CAGR will be.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvBVD-qq6oU9qCe0CI8B2Er92aqyAdqI0cR3nKx8uhnJYGpxYSorh9z1d3g10KTGNR_whwBwNaQBeOnxKg6ipsJNEvFPOY-8kYkdQw5QivNVB7yKB7Brx3_UNGqRHFZto68XiHm82f39t69fxn7sG9Tg6RwerOLaoOsw-HjDIwnaizu2lTRTgV235MqGTvnyjbhM0hAR5_Po5Ey7YSWKjtmwtdtPOqsTe0xLoUOItEL6w6ZduuJRZFzCKsvVxNbi-yciRQGcPOMVQ8KM0dEHuhODRySbzLQnOmF7KGX-HPfw2ymBYs4nCjSDEwK9WYBXcSzZP4mIGy3P1VIiWom09hruunNS-abyvOku3F-boxTnpA&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAlVJ--VrrWREAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvBVD-qq6oU9qCe0CI8B2Er92aqyAdqI0cR3nKx8uhnJYGpxYSorh9z1d3g10KTGNR_whwBwNaQBeOnxKg6ipsJNEvFPOY-8kYkdQw5QivNVB7yKB7Brx3_UNGqRHFZto68XiHm82f39t69fxn7sG9Tg6RwerOLaoOsw-HjDIwnaizu2lTRTgV235MqGTvnyjbhM0hAR5_Po5Ey7YSWKjtmwtdtPOqsTe0xLoUOItEL6w6ZduuJRZFzCKsvVxNbi-yciRQGcPOMVQ8KM0dEHuhODRySbzLQnOmF7KGX-HPfw2ymBYs4nCjSDEwK9WYBXcSzZP4mIGy3P1VIiWom09hruunNS-abyvOku3F-boxTnpA&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAlVJ--VrrWREAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

In a chart, this pattern of activity would follow the shape of a capital \"J\".\n\nThe J-curve effect is often cited in economics to describe, for instance, the way that a country’s [balance of trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp) initially worsens following a devaluation of its currency, then quickly recovers and finally surpasses its previous performance.\n\nJ-curves are observed in other fields including medicine and political science.

Put bluntly, it shows that things are going to get worse before they get better.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A J-curve depicts a trend that starts with a sharp drop and is followed by a dramatic rise.\n* The trendline ends in an improvement from the starting point.\n* In economics, the J-curve shows how a currency depreciation causes a severe worsening of a trade imbalance followed by a substantial improvement.\n\nIn economics, it is often used to observe the effects of a weaker currency on trade balances. The pattern is as follows:\n\n* Immediately after a nation's currency is devalued, imports get more expensive and exports get cheaper, creating a worsening [trade deficit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade_deficit.asp) (or at least a smaller trade surplus).\n* Shortly thereafter, the sales volume of the nation's exports begins to rise steadily, thanks to their relatively cheap prices.\n* At the same time, consumers at home begin to buy more locally-produced goods because they are relatively affordable compared to imports.\n* Over time, the trade balance between the nation and its partners bounces back and even exceeds pre-devaluation times.\n\nThe devaluation of the nation's currency had an immediate negative effect because of an inevitable lag in satisfying greater demand for the country's products.\n\nWhen a [country’s currency appreciates](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/080613/effects-currency-fluctuations-economy.asp), economists note, a reverse J-curve may occur. The country’s exports abruptly become more expensive for importing countries. If other countries can fill the demand for a lower price, the stronger currency will reduce its export competitiveness. Local consumers may switch to imports, too, because they have become more competitive with locally-produced goods.\n\n### The J-Curve in Private Equity\n\nThe term J-curve is used to describe the typical trajectory of investments made by a private equity firm.\n\nThe J-curve is a visual representation of the plain fact that sometimes things will get worse before they get better.\n\nPrivate equity firms have a different path to profitability than public companies or the funds that invest in them.\n\nTheir portfolios, by design, are made up of companies that were performing poorly when they were purchased. The firm then spends substantial amounts of money retooling the company before spinning it off as a renewed company.\n\nThat means an initial decline in performance followed, at least theoretically, by a steep improvement in performance.", "timestamp": 1654656054, "digest": "ERsZj3opV9PIwjj8OpaLXBOnb0y9bflYYSp-zHlXnpM", "contributor": "0xe6D4607eB0627096f2f1a32950d0f225B83083Fb"}

{"id": "he2OMOn4ZC-4LbDCVp0hr8nn80oAw_NdBA88m72KY_M", "title": "Compound Interest", "body": "## What Is Compound Interest?\n\nCompound interest (or compounding interest) is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound interest can be thought of as \"interest on interest,\" and will make a sum grow at a faster rate than [simple interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple_interest.asp), which is calculated only on the principal amount.\n\nThe rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of compounding, such that the higher the number of [compounding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp) periods, the greater the compound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100 compounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5% semi-annually over the same time period. Because the interest-on-interest effect can generate increasingly positive returns based on the initial principal amount, compounding has sometimes been referred to as the \"miracle of compound interest.\"\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Compound interest (or compounding interest) is interest calculated on the initial principal, which also includes all of the accumulated interest from previous periods on a deposit or loan.\n* Compound interest is calculated by multiplying the initial principal amount by one plus the annual interest rate raised to the number of compound periods minus one.\n* Interest can be compounded on any given frequency schedule, from continuous to daily to annually.\n* When calculating compound interest, the number of compounding periods makes a significant difference.\n\n#### Understanding Compound Interest\n\n## How Compound Interest Works\n\nCompound interest is calculated by multiplying the initial [principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp) amount by one plus the annual interest rate raised to the number of compound periods minus one. The total initial [amount of the loan](https://www.investopedia.com/loan-calculator-5104934) is then subtracted from the resulting value.\n\nKatie Kerpel {Copyright} Investopedia, 2019.\n\nThe formula for [calculating the amount of compound interest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020614/learn-simple-and-compound-interest.asp) is as follows:\n\n* **Compound interest** = total amount of principal and interest in future (or future value) *less* principal amount at present (or present value)\n\n> ***= \\[P (1 + i)n\\] – P***\n\n> ***= P \\[(1 + i)n – 1\\]***\n\nWhere:\n\n> *P = principal*\n\n> *i* = nominal annual interest rate in percentage terms\n\n> *n = number of compounding periods*\n\nTake a three-year loan of $10,000 at an interest rate of 5% that compounds annually. What would be the amount of interest? In this case, it would be:\n\n> *$10,000 \\[(1 + 0.05)3 – 1\\] = $10,000 \\[1.157625 – 1\\] = $1,576.25*\n\n## How Compound Interest Grows\n\nBecause compound interest includes interest accumulated in previous periods, it grows at an ever-accelerating rate. In the example above, though the total interest payable over the three-year period of this loan is $1,576.25, the interest amount is not the same for all three years, as it would be with [simple interest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/how-can-i-tell-if-loan-uses-simple-or-compound-interest.asp). The interest payable at the end of each year is shown in the table below.\n\nCompound interest can significantly boost investment returns over the long term. While a $100,000 deposit that receives 5% simple annual interest would earn $50,000 in total interest over 10 years, the annual compound interest of 5% on $10,000 would amount to $62,889.46 over the same period. If the compounding period were instead paid monthly over the same 10-year period at 5% compound interest, the total interest would instead grow to $64,700.95.1\n\n## Compound Interest Schedules\n\nInterest can be compounded on any given frequency schedule, from [daily](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-does-it-mean-when-interest-accrues-daily.asp) to annually. There are standard compounding frequency schedules that are usually applied to financial instruments.\n\nThe commonly used compounding schedule for [savings accounts at banks](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/062315/how-interest-rates-work-savings-accounts.asp) is daily. For a [certificate of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) (CD), typical compounding frequency schedules are daily, monthly, or semiannually; for [money market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarket.asp) accounts, it's often daily. For home mortgage loans, home equity loans, personal business loans, or credit card accounts, the most commonly applied compounding schedule is monthly.\n\nThere can also be variations in the time frame in which the accrued interest is actually credited to the existing balance. Interest on an account may be compounded daily but only credited monthly. It is only when the interest is actually credited, or added to the existing balance, that it begins to earn additional interest in the account.\n\nSome banks also offer something called [continuously compounding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/continuouscompounding.asp) interest, which adds interest to the principal at every possible instant. For practical purposes, it doesn't accrue that much more than daily compounding interest unless you want to put money in and take it out the same day.\n\nMore frequent compounding of interest is beneficial to the investor or creditor. For a borrower, the opposite is true.\n\n### Compounding Periods\n\nWhen calculating compound interest, the number of compounding periods makes a significant difference. The basic rule is that the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the amount of compound interest.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the difference that the number of compounding periods can make for a $10,000 loan with an annual 10% interest rate over a 10-year period.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nCompound interest is closely tied to the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033015/why-time-value-money-tvm-important-concept-investors.asp) and the [Rule of 72](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp), both important concepts in investing.\n\n### Time Value of Money Consideration\n\nUnderstanding the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) and the exponential growth created by compounding is essential for investors looking to optimize their income and wealth allocation.\n\nThe formula for obtaining the future value (FV) and present value (PV) are as follows:\n\n> ***FV = PV (1 +i)n and PV = FV / (1 + i) n***\n\nFor example, the future value of $10,000 compounded at 5% annually for three years:\n\n> *= $10,000 (1 + 0.05)3*\n\n> *= $10,000 (1.157625)*\n\n> *= $11,576.25*\n\nThe present value of $11,576.25 discounted at 5% for three years:\n\n> *= $11,576.25 / (1 + 0.05)3*\n\n> *= $11,576.25 / 1.157625*\n\n> *= $10,000*\n\nThe reciprocal of 1.157625, which equals 0.8638376, is the discount factor in this instance.\n\n### Rule of 72 Consideration\n\nThe so-called [Rule of 72 ](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-the-rule-72/)calculates the approximate time over which an investment will double at a given rate of return or interest \"i,\" and is given by (72/i). It can only be used for annual compounding.2\n\nAs an example, an investment that has a 6% annual rate of return will double in 12 years. An investment with an 8% annual rate of return will thus double in nine years.\n\n## Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)\n\nThe [compound annual growth rate ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp)(CAGR) is used for most financial applications that require the calculation of a single growth rate over a period of time.\n\nLet's say your investment portfolio has grown from $10,000 to $16,000 over five years; what is the CAGR? Essentially, this means that PV = -$10,000, FV = $16,000, and t = 5, so the variable “i” has to be calculated. Using a financial calculator or Excel, it can be shown that i = 9.86%.\n\n### \n\n*According to the cash-flow convention, your initial investment (PV) of $10,000 is shown with a negative sign because it represents an outflow of funds. PV and FV must necessarily have opposite signs to solve for “i” in the above equation.*\n\n### CAGR Real-Life Applications\n\nThe CAGR is extensively used to calculate returns over periods of time for stock, [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051415/what-difference-between-mutual-fund-and-money-market-fund.asp), and investment portfolios. The CAGR is also used to ascertain whether a mutual fund manager or portfolio manager has exceeded the market’s rate of return over a period of time. If, for example, a market index has provided total returns of 10% over a five-year period, but a fund manager has only generated annual returns of 9% over the same period, the manager has underperformed the market.\n\nThe CAGR can also be used to calculate the expected growth rate of investment portfolios over long periods of time, which is useful for purposes such as saving for retirement. Consider the following examples:\n\n**Example 1:** A risk-averse investor is happy with a modest 3% annual rate of return on her portfolio. Her present $100,000 portfolio would, therefore, grow to $180,611 after 20 years. In contrast, a risk-tolerant investor who expects an annual return of 6% on her portfolio would see $100,000 grow to $320,714 after 20 years.\n\n**Example 2:** The CAGR can be used to estimate how much needs to be stowed away to save for a specific objective. A couple who would like to save $50,000 over 10 years toward a down payment on a condo would need to save $4,165 per year if they assume an annual return (CAGR) of 4% on their savings. If they are prepared to take a little extra risk and expect a CAGR of 5%, they would need to save $3,975 annually.\n\n**Example 3:** The CAGR can also demonstrate the virtues of investing earlier rather than later in life. If the objective is to save $1 million by retirement at age 65, based on a CAGR of 6%, a 25-year old would need to save $6,462 per year to attain this goal. A 40-year old, on the other hand, would need to save $18,227, or almost three times that amount, to attain the same goal.\n\n### \n\n*CAGRs are often used when measuring economic data. Here is an example: China’s per capita GDP increased from $193 in 1980 to $6,091 in 2012. What is the annual growth in per capita GDP over this 32-year period? The growth rate “i” in this case works out to be an impressive 11.4%.*\n\n## Pros and Cons of Compounding\n\nThough the miracle of compounding has led to the apocryphal story of Albert Einstein calling it the eighth wonder of the world or man’s greatest invention, compounding can also work against consumers who have loans that carry very high interest rates, such as [credit card debt.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp) A credit card balance of $20,000 carried at an interest rate of 20% compounded monthly would result in a total compound interest of $4,388 over one year or about $365 per month.\n\nOn the positive side, compounding can work to your advantage when it comes to your investments and can be a potent factor in wealth creation. Exponential growth from compounding interest is also important in mitigating wealth-eroding factors, such as increases in the cost of living, inflation, and reduced purchasing power.\n\nMutual funds offer one of the easiest ways for investors to [reap the benefits of compound interest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100715/how-do-mutual-funds-compound-interest.asp). Opting to reinvest dividends derived from the mutual fund results in purchasing more shares of the fund. More compound interest accumulates over time, and the cycle of purchasing more shares will continue to help the investment in the fund grow in value.\n\nConsider a mutual fund investment opened with an initial $5,000 and an annual addition of $2,400. With an average annual return of 12% over 30 years, the future value of the fund is $798,500. The compound interest is the difference between the cash contributed to an investment and the actual future value of the investment. In this case, by contributing $77,000, or a cumulative contribution of just $200 per month, over 30 years, compound interest is $721,500 of the future balance.\n\nOf course, earnings from compound interest are taxable, unless the money is in a [tax-sheltered account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxshelter.asp); it's ordinarily taxed at the standard rate associated with the taxpayer's tax bracket.\n\n## Compound Interest Investments\n\nAn investor who opts for a [dividend reinvestment plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp) (DRIP) within a brokerage account is essentially using the power of compounding in whatever they invest.\n\nInvestors can also experience compounding interest with the purchase of a [zero-coupon bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp). Traditional bond issues provide investors with periodic interest payments based on the original terms of the bond issue, and because these are paid out to the investor in the form of a check, interest does not compound. Zero-coupon bonds do not send interest checks to investors; instead, this type of bond is purchased at a discount to its original value and grows over time. Zero-coupon bond issuers use the power of compounding to increase the value of the bond so it reaches its full price at maturity.\n\nCompounding can also work for you when making loan repayments. Making half your mortgage payment twice a month, for example, rather than making the full payment once a month, will end up cutting down your amortization period and saving you a substantial amount of interest.\n\n## How to Calculate Compound Interest\n\nIf it's been a while since your math class days, fear not: There are handy tools for figuring out compounding. Many calculators (both handheld and computer-based) have exponent functions you can utilize for these purposes.\n\n### Calculating Compound Interest in Excel\n\nIf more complicated compounding tasks arise, [you can perform them in Microsoft Excel](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031915/how-do-i-calculate-compound-interest-using-excel.asp)—in three different ways.\n\n1. The first way to calculate compound interest is to multiply each year's new balance by the interest rate. Suppose you deposit $1,000 into a savings account with a 5% interest rate that compounds annually, and you want to calculate the balance in five years. In Microsoft Excel, enter \"Year\" into cell A1 and \"Balance\" into cell B1. Enter years 0 to 5 into cells A2 through A7. The balance for year 0 is $1,000, so you would enter \"1000\" into cell B2. Next, enter \"=B2\\*1.05\" into cell B3. Then enter \"=B3\\*1.05\" into cell B4 and continue to do this until you get to cell B7. In cell B7, the calculation is \"=B6\\*1.05\". Finally, the calculated value in cell B7—$1,276.28—is the balance in your savings account after five years. To find the compound interest value, subtract $1,000 from $1,276.28; this gives you a value of $276.28.\n2. The second way to calculate compound interest is to use a fixed formula. The compound interest formula is ((P\\*(1+i)^n) - P), where P is the principal, i is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of periods. Using the same information above, enter \"Principal value\" into cell A1 and 1000 into cell B1. Next, enter \"Interest rate\" into cell A2 and \".05\" into cell B2. Enter \"Compound periods\" into cell A3 and \"5\" into cell B3. Now you can calculate the compound interest in cell B4 by entering \"=(B1\\*(1+B2)^B3)-B1\", which gives you $276.28.\n3. A third way to calculate compound interest is to create a macro function. First start the Visual Basic Editor, which is located in the developer tab. Click the Insert menu, and click on Module. Then type \"Function Compound_Interest (P As Double, I As Double, N As Double) As Double\" in the first line. On the second line, hit the tab key and type in \"Compound_Interest = (P\\*(1+i)^n) - P.\" On the third line of the module, enter \"End Function.\" You have created a function macro to calculate the compound interest rate. Continuing from the same Excel worksheet above, enter \"Compound interest\" into cell A6 and enter \"=Compound_Interest(B1, B2, B3).\" This gives you a value of $276.28, which is consistent with the first two values.\n\n### Other Compound Interest Calculators\n\nA number of free compound interest calculators are offered online, and many handheld calculators can carry out these tasks as well.\n\n* The free compound interest calculator offered through **[Financial-Calculators.com](https://financial-calculators.com/compound-interest-calculator)** is simple to operate and offers to compound frequency choices from daily through annually. It includes an option to select continuous compounding and also allows input of actual calendar start and end dates. After inputting the necessary calculation data, the results show interest earned, future value, [annual percentage yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) or APY) ([a measure that includes compounding](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/apr-apy-bank-hopes-cant-tell-difference/)), and daily interest.3\n* **[Investor.gov](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)**, a website operated by the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC), offers a free online [compound interest calculator](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator). The calculator is fairly simple, but it does allow inputs of monthly additional deposits to the principal, which is helpful for calculating earnings where additional monthly savings are being deposited.4\n* A free online interest calculator with a few more features is available at **[TheCalculatorSite.com](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)**. This calculator allows calculations for different currencies, the ability to factor in monthly deposits or withdrawals, and the option to have inflation-adjusted increases to monthly deposits or withdrawals automatically calculated as well.1\n\n## How Can I Tell If Interest Is Compounded?\n\nThe [Truth in Lending Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tila.asp) (TILA) requires that lenders disclose loan terms to potential borrowers, including the total dollar amount of interest to be repaid over the life of the loan and whether interest accrues simply or is compounded.5\n\nAnother method is to compare a loan's interest rate to its [annual percentage rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp) (APR), which the TILA also requires lenders to disclose. The APR converts the finance charges of your loan, which include all interest and fees, to a simple interest rate. A substantial difference between the interest rate and APR means one or both of two scenarios: Your loan uses compound interest, or it includes hefty loan fees in addition to interest. Even when it comes to the same type of loan, the APR range can vary wildly between lenders depending on the financial institution's fees and other costs.\n\nYou'll note that the interest rate you are charged also depends on your credit. Loans [offered to those with excellent credit](https://www.investopedia.com/best-personal-loans-for-excellent-credit-4797495) carry significantly lower interest rates than those charged to borrowers [with poor credit](https://www.investopedia.com/best-personal-loans-for-bad-credit-4774349).\n\n## What Is a Simple Definition of Compound Interest?\n\nCompound interest refers to the phenomenon whereby the interest associated with a bank account, loan, or investment increases exponentially—rather than linearly—over time. The key to understanding the concept is the word “compound.”\n\nSuppose you make a $100 investment in a business that pays you a 10% dividend every year. You have the choice of either pocketing those dividend payments like cash or reinvesting those payments into additional shares. If you choose the second option, reinvesting the dividends and compounding them together with your initial $100 investment, then the returns you generate will start to grow over time.\n\n## Who Benefits From Compound Interest?\n\nSimply put, compound interest benefits investors, but the meaning of “investors” can be quite broad. Banks, for instance, benefit from compound interest when they lend money and reinvest the interest they receive into giving out additional loans. Depositors also benefit from compound interest when they receive interest on their bank accounts, bonds, or other investments.\n\nIt is important to note that although the term “compound interest” includes the word “interest,” the concept applies beyond situations for which the word interest is typically used, such as bank accounts and loans.\n\n## Can Compound Interest Make You Rich?\n\nYes. In fact, compound interest is arguably the most powerful force for generating wealth ever conceived. There are records of merchants, lenders, and various businesspeople using compound interest to become rich for literally thousands of years. In the ancient city of Babylon, for example, clay tablets were used over 4,000 years ago to instruct students on the mathematics of compound interest. \n\nIn modern times, [Warren Buffett](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/rules-that-warren-buffett-lives-by.aspx) became one of the richest people in the world through a business strategy that involved diligently and patiently compounding his investment returns over long periods of time.6 It is likely that, in one form or another, people will be using compound interest to generate wealth for the foreseeable future.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvpFG8CcxiaDmUMjFezLhAQWoeX6uHG1ukqaMXL1rF1vhm5Y_rXPUXp3wTdWMwi7RCmIJGIZf98VWHZooM47jTTNVY5CA-3kzH0g6ctYrojLw9W3fM5fSvSMC4FcOiTRUDIFWFk_hSnvs7YcdkNyDZbQ4-bUVHR0Gqcn6j1vjHnKfJk3s70nW_IHZy6WCjngwpSq7JpKd-4UJdqA94jTLun43Bh5XA1j0sFy0U6Nc73thjxVhwDUbtAUS4oIFfCOFSQw8UivBUce_LTygHx1ZQuVFRfJaE9RqQSb8BLc0Ghzud7kR1caFqv_dlTiK5uoa4T0wgZCuPpvA&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEuK3tPTTtAJEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

This article offers an update of that valuation based on updated Ethereum’s official PoS staking yield.\n\nAs a tradfi banking analyst (i.e. I follow the banking sector), my daily job has been following the fundmantal trends and reflect them in my valuation models. <https://twitter.com/mishleeee>\n\n## Conclusions from my exercise:\n\n**The staking income offers good buffer for the ETH investment in USD term should ETH price remain volatile.**\n\n**A base case scenario assuming ETH as a perpetual bond with 1) 6.9% long-term staking yield; 2) 3% discount rate as your funding cost, fair value = $4,370, 130% upside from current $ 1,900.**\n\nYou can play around with [my model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\\_bkW9uo7NYPPKiaSyswGtbi_v6j-Nk8\\_/edit?usp=sharing\\&ouid=100007872474593135826\\&rtpof=true\\&sd=true).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*hCn2rxv3iuiOJyOtGqH35Q.png)\n\nFigure 1: ETH fair value scenario analysis\n\n## **ETH as a bond**\n\nArthur Hayes framework is interesting in that it could very much become the reality and sometime in the future institutional investors are going to offer ETH linked product to their clients as a quasi-fixed income investment. [link](https://medium.com/@cryptohayes/five-ducking-digits-cd92a7ab72ce)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2fabP5n9hBiiGyTeu38OEQ.png)\n\nFigure 2: ETH: Number of addresses with balance ≥32 ETH; Source: [Glassnode](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=ETH\\&category=Distribution\\&m=addresses.Min32Count\\&resolution=1month\\&s=1590705360\\&u=1654560000\\&zoom=)\n\nHowever there are a few things can be improved\n\n1.  Arthur uses the staking yield at the Merge of 8% — 11.5% as the long term return for validators, which may not be sustainable as more validators join the scene and share the rewards; according to the latest staking reward prediction published Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, the long term base case scenario yield is actually 5.4% [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0).\n2.  he uses US treasury yield as the discount rate for the valuation, which is much lower than what we use for corporate bonds (ETH’s creditworthy in the eyes of a typical institutions is lower than US government); we need to apply a higher discount ;\n3.  his price target looks weird in that he directly applies current price to the present value (PV) of 32ETH initial investment and arrive at a range of price target. Let’s not blame Arthur as we all know he is not a bond expert.\n\nI don’t think everybody reads his tables easily. It’s the same for me! So, let me explain in a bit more details.\n\n## The discounted cash flow model\n\nThis exercise employs a valuation model called “present value”, which discounts back the future cash flows of an investment.\n\nAssuming post the Merge a validator would lock in 32 ETH and in return she receives continous validator rewards. And at the end of her investment period, let’s say 5 years, she decides to withdraw her ETH and cease to be a validator. The investment horizon could vary depending on how you think about ETH validator’s horizon.\n\nIn next 5 years the cash flow stream would look like below — the continous validator rewards as well as a lumpsum return of capital of 32 ETH at the end of the 5th year.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*oS8H0\\_dAfC6DUlgIClUgAg.png)\n\nFigure 3: 5 year cash flow of a validator and the present value calculation\n\nTo arrive at the present value we just need to discount these cash flows with a discount rate, using 3.11% for the table above. Add them all together we arrive at 35.3ETH, which is higher than our initial investment of 32 ETH. This investment has generated a positive net present value as the long term return of 5.4% (can think of it as a bond coupon rate) is higher than the required return (discount rate) 3.11%. If the discount rate rises higher to exceed 5.4%, our investment will present a negative present value. Because the return rate is lower than the required return to compensate investors for the risks they are taking. This is exactly why some bonds are trading at discount to its face value of 100.\n\n## The sensitivity analysis\n\nA few parameters affect our valuation\n\n1.  Your investment horizon: In the exercise I have 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years and perpetual scenarios.\n2.  Your discount rate: I used US treasury yield of same duration plus 50 basis points as the discount rate. Remember, the level of discount rate would affect the net present value. Depending on how much you think about your cost of borrowing and your required return on this investment. An investor with 2.5% borrowing cost and one with 4.5% borrowing cost would arrive at very different conclusion.\n3.  Staking yield: I offered a range from 9.10% to 3.3% which is the range offered by Justin Drake for both immediately after the merge and for the long run. His spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ShTwNvpn4egJqqAFRVnnARqNhFCdRw8q/edit?usp=sharing\\&ouid=100007872474593135826\\&rtpof=true\\&sd=true).\n\nI inclulde a range of sensitivity analysis to test the results under different scenarios.\n\n1.  **Present value of a validator locking up her 32 ETH. **You would notice under some scenarios when the funding cost is higher than the staking yield, the present value is falling below 32 ETH. It basically says when the yield on your assets is lower than your borrowing cost, this investment is loss-making. Imagine when the rental yield is lower than your mortgage cost, without price appreciation, would you invest in a property like that?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dr_CjD6f2\\_ollY7BrN3YSA.png)\n\nFigure 4: FigurePresent value of 32 ETH investment\n\n2\\. % return to initial capital.

If 32 ETH investment can create more value, then it’s fair value should reflect such value creation. Here the math is simple, fair value = spot ETH price \\* present value in ETH from Figure 3\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*hCn2rxv3iuiOJyOtGqH35Q.png)\n\nFigure 6: Implied fair value of ETH\n\n4.ETH breakeven price. Since for majority of the cases, 32 ETH is going to come back with>32 ETH, that offers you some buffer in USD term should ETH price retreat in the future. Entry price at spot is$1900, if investing for 5 year with 8% staking yield, at a 2.95% funding cost, you can sustain ETH price down to $1576 and still make money. Your staking yield offsets the price correction.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*018T2O-K4YCEXS7mJhs3Jg.png)\n\nFigure 7: ETH breakeven price\n\nHope you like this framework.\n\nFor more fundamental analysis on crypto and macro, follow me on twitter <https://twitter.com/mishleeee>\n", "timestamp": 1654656367, "digest": "F6pc7ctO64Z3aJBtUWjePYnNbnKg9pE2U_iRH4UFl6A", "contributor": "0xACD74a7F90734026081C9D3191d7B1471B05c442"}
{"id": "RnisvPW9g3Qvupng_ylXps3T0jVY5A-HWalSko-wSR4", "title": "Just-in-Time (JIT)", "body": "## What Is Just-in-Time (JIT)?\n\nThe just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that aligns raw-material orders from suppliers directly with production schedules. Companies employ this inventory strategy to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they need them for the production process, which reduces inventory costs. This method requires producers to forecast demand accurately.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that minimizes inventory and increases efficiency.\n* Just-in-time manufacturing is also known as the Toyota Production System (TPS) because the car manufacturer Toyota adopted the system in the 1970s.\n* Kanban is a scheduling system often used in conjunction with JIT to avoid overcapacity of work in process.\n* The success of the JIT production process relies on steady production, high-quality workmanship, no machine breakdowns, and reliable suppliers.\n* The terms short-cycle manufacturing, used by Motorola, and continuous-flow manufacturing, used by IBM, are synonymous with the JIT system.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 46 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:46\n\n#### Just In Time\n\n## How Does Just-in-Time Inventory Work?\n\nThe just-in-time (JIT) inventory system minimizes inventory and increases efficiency. JIT production systems cut inventory costs because manufacturers receive materials and parts as needed for production and do not have to pay storage costs. Manufacturers are also not left with unwanted inventory if an order is canceled or not fulfilled.\n\nOne example of a JIT inventory system is a car manufacturer that operates with low inventory levels but heavily relies on its supply chain to deliver the parts it requires to build cars on an as-needed basis. Consequently, the manufacturer orders the parts required to assemble the vehicles only after an order is received.\n\nFor JIT manufacturing to succeed, companies must have steady production, high-quality workmanship, glitch-free plant machinery, and reliable suppliers.\n\n### \n\n*The JIT inventory system contrasts with [just-in-case](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp) strategies, where producers hold sufficient inventories to have enough products to absorb maximum market demand.*\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of JIT\n\nJIT inventory systems have several advantages over traditional models. Production runs are short, which means that manufacturers can quickly move from one product to another. Also, this method reduces costs by minimizing warehouse needs. Companies also spend less money on [raw materials](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp) because they buy just enough resources to make the ordered products and no more.\n\nThe disadvantages of JIT inventory systems involve potential disruptions in the supply chain. If a raw-materials supplier has a breakdown and cannot deliver the goods promptly, this could conceivably stall the entire production line. A sudden unexpected order for goods may delay the delivery of finished products to end clients.\n\n## Example of JIT\n\nFamous for its JIT inventory system, Toyota Motor Corporation orders parts only when it receives new car orders. Although the company installed this method in the 1970s, it took 20 years to perfect it.\n\nSadly, Toyota's JIT inventory system nearly caused the company to come to a screeching halt in February 1997, after a fire at Japanese-owned automotive parts supplier Aisin decimated its capacity to produce P-valves for Toyota's vehicles. Because Aisin is the sole supplier of this part, its weeks-long shutdown caused Toyota to halt production for several days. This caused a ripple effect, where other Toyota parts suppliers likewise had to temporarily shut down because the automaker had no need for their parts during that time period. Consequently, this fire cost Toyota 160 billion yen in revenue.1\n\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effect on the economy and supply chain, things like paper surgical masks, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer experienced disruption. This was because inputs from overseas factories and warehouses could not be delivered in time to meet the surge in demand caused by the pandemic.2\n\n## Special Considerations\n\n[Kanban](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kanban.asp) is a Japanese scheduling system that's often used in conjunction with lean manufacturing and JIT. Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiency.3\n\nThe Kanban system highlights problem areas by measuring lead and cycle times across the production process, which helps identify upper limits for work-in-process inventory to avoid overcapacity.\n\n## What Exactly Do You Mean by Just-in-Time?\n\nA just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that has a company receive goods as close as possible to when they are actually needed. So, if a car assembly plant needs to install airbags, it does not keep a stock of airbags on its shelves but receives them as those cars come onto the assembly line.\n\n## Doesn't This Sound a Bit Risky? What If Things Don't Arrive in Time?\n\nA chief benefit of a JIT system is that it minimizes the need for a company to store large quantities of inventory, which improves efficiency and provides substantial cost savings. However, if there is a supply or demand shock, it can bring everything to a halt.\n\nFor instance, at the beginning of the 2020's economic crisis, everything from ventilators to surgical masks experienced disruption as inputs from overseas could not reach their destinations in time to meet a surge in demand.2\n\n## What Types of Companies Use JIT?\n\nThe JIT inventory system is popular with [small businesses and major corporations alike](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051215/what-are-some-examples-just-time-jit-inventory-processes.asp) because it enhances cash flow and reduces the capital needed to run the business. Retailers, restaurants, on-demand publishing, tech manufacturing, and automobile manufacturing are examples of industries that have benefited from just-in-time inventory.\n\n## Who Invented JIT Inventory Management?\n\nJIT is attributed to the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. Executives at Toyota in the 1970s reasoned that the company could adapt more quickly and efficiently to changes in trends or demands for model changes if it did not keep any more inventory in-store than was immediately needed.", "timestamp": 1654656334, "digest": "rNjR5363bufiUY8SX3hj7zUQnzEbPx6hGTT4jCgdkZg", "contributor": "0x77FBcf23A7FdC38d8B949509578a1bA01431a672"}
{"id": "xWop1isnfmrF1tEl_9NQ0KGQhKWHi5FtjAHaBezDaHo", "title": "Conflict Theory", "body": "## What Is Conflict Theory?\n\nConflict theory, first developed by [Karl Marx](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/karl-marx.asp), is a theory that society is in a state of perpetual conflict because of competition for limited resources.\n\nConflict theory holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than by consensus and conformity. According to conflict theory, those with [wealth and power](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealtheffect.asp) try to hold on to it by any means possible, chiefly by suppressing the poor and powerless. A basic premise of conflict theory is that individuals and groups within society will work to try to maximize their own wealth and power.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Conflict theory focuses on the competition among groups within society over limited resources.\n* Conflict theory views social and economic institutions as tools of the struggle among groups or classes, used to maintain inequality and the dominance of the ruling class.\n* Marxist conflict theory sees society as divided along lines of economic class between the proletarian working class and the bourgeois ruling class.\n* Later versions of conflict theory look at other dimensions of conflict among capitalist factions and among various social, religious, and other types of groups.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 23 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:23\n\n#### Conflict Theory\n\n## Understanding Conflict Theory\n\nConflict theory has sought to explain a wide range of social phenomena, including wars, revolutions, [poverty](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poverty.asp), discrimination, and domestic violence. It ascribes most of the fundamental developments in human history, such as democracy and civil rights, to [capitalistic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp) attempts to control the masses (as opposed to a desire for social order). Central tenets of conflict theory are the concepts of social inequality, the division of resources, and the conflicts that exist among different socioeconomic classes.\n\nThe central tenets of conflict theory can explain many types of societal conflicts throughout history. Some theorists believe, as Marx did, that societal conflict is the force that ultimately drives change and development in society.\n\nMarx’s version of conflict theory focused on the conflict between two primary classes. Each class consists of a group of people bound by mutual interests and a certain degree of property ownership. Marx theorized about the bourgeoisie, a group that represented members of society who hold the majority of the [wealth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/upper-class.asp) and means. The proletariat is the other group: It includes those considered [working-class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/working-class.asp) or poor.\n\nWith the rise of capitalism, Marx theorized that the [bourgeoisie](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/middle-class.asp), a minority within the population, would use their influence to oppress the proletariat, the majority class. This way of thinking is tied to a common image associated with conflict theory-based models of society; adherents to this philosophy tend to believe in a pyramid arrangement in terms of how goods and services are distributed in society. At the top of the pyramid is a small group of elites that dictate terms and conditions to the larger portion of society because they have an outsized amount of control over resources and power.\n\nUneven distribution within society was predicted to be maintained through ideological coercion; the bourgeoisie would force acceptance of the current conditions by the proletariat. Conflict theory assumes that the elite will set up systems of laws, traditions, and other societal structures in order to further support their own dominance while preventing others from joining their ranks.\n\nMarx theorized that, as the working class and poor were subjected to worsening conditions, a collective consciousness would raise more awareness about inequality, and this would potentially result in revolt. If, after the revolt, conditions were adjusted to favor the concerns of the proletariat, the conflict circle would eventually repeat but in the opposite direction. The bourgeoisie would eventually become the aggressor and revolter, grasping for the return of the structures that formerly maintained their dominance.1\n\n## Conflict Theory Assumptions\n\nCurrent conflict theory has four primary assumptions that are helpful to understand: competition, revolution, structural inequality, and war.\n\n### Competition\n\nConflict theorists believe that competition is a constant and, at times, an overwhelming factor in nearly every human relationship and interaction. Competition exists as a result of the scarcity of resources, including material resources—money, property, commodities, and more. Beyond material resources, individuals and groups within a society compete for intangible resources as well. These can include leisure time, dominance, social status, sexual partners, etc. Conflict theorists assume that competition is the default (rather than cooperation).\n\n### Revolution\n\nGiven conflict theorists' assumption that conflict occurs between social classes, one outcome of this conflict is a revolutionary event. The idea is that change in a power dynamic between groups does not happen as the result of a gradual adaptation. Rather, it comes about as the symptom of conflict between these groups. In this way, changes to a power dynamic are often abrupt and large in scale, rather than gradual and evolutionary.\n\n### Structural inequality\n\nAn important assumption of conflict theory is that human relationships and social structures all experience inequalities of power. In this way, some individuals and groups inherently develop more power and reward than others. Following this, those individuals and groups that benefit from a particular structure of society tend to work to maintain those structures as a way of retaining and enhancing their power.\n\n### War\n\nConflict theorists tend to see war as either a unifier or as a \"cleanser\" of societies. In conflict theory, war is the result of a cumulative and growing conflict between individuals and groups and between entire societies. In the context of war, a society may become unified in some ways, but conflict still remains between multiple societies. On the other hand, war may also result in the wholesale end of a society.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nMarx viewed capitalism as part of a historical progression of economic systems. He believed capitalism was rooted in [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), or things that are purchased and sold. For example, he believed that labor is a type of commodity. Because laborers have little control or power in the economic system (because they don’t own factories or materials), their worth can be devalued over time. This can create an imbalance between business owners and their workers, which can eventually lead to social conflicts. He believed these problems would eventually be fixed through a social and economic revolution. \n\n### Adaptations of Marx's conflict theory\n\nMax Weber, a German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist, adopted many aspects of Marx's conflict theory and later further refined some of Marx's ideas. Weber believed that conflict over property was not limited to one specific scenario. Rather, he believed that there were multiple layers of conflict existing at any given moment and in every society.\n\nWhereas Marx framed his view of conflict as one between owners and workers, Weber also added an emotional component to his ideas about conflict. Weber said: \"It is these that underlie the power of religion and make it an important ally of the state; that transform classes into status groups, and do the same to territorial communities under particular circumstances...and that make 'legitimacy' a crucial focus for efforts at domination.\"2\n\nWeber's beliefs about conflict extend beyond Marx's because they suggest that some forms of social interaction, including conflict, generate beliefs and solidarity between individuals and groups within a society. In this way, an individual's reactions to inequality might be different depending on the groups with which they are associated; whether they perceive those in power to be legitimate; and so on.\n\nConflict theorists of the later 20th and early 21st centuries have continued to extend conflict theory beyond the strict economic classes posited by Marx, although economic relations remain a core feature of the inequalities across groups in the various branches of conflict theory. Conflict theory is highly influential in modern and postmodern theories of sexual and racial inequality, peace and conflict studies, and the many varieties of identity studies that have arisen across Western academia in the past several decades.\n\n## Examples of Conflict Theory\n\nConflict theorists view the relationship between a housing complex owner and a tenant as being based mainly on conflict instead of balance or harmony, even though there may be more harmony than conflict. They believe that they are defined by getting whatever resources they can from each other.\n\nIn the above example, some of the limited resources that may contribute to conflicts between tenants and the complex owner include the limited space within the complex, the limited number of units, the money that tenants pay to the complex owner for rent, and so on. Ultimately, conflict theorists see this dynamic as one of conflict over these resources.\n\nThe complex owner, however gracious, is fundamentally focused on getting as many apartment units filled as possible so that they can make as much money in rent as possible, especially if bills such as [mortgages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) and utilities must be covered. This may introduce conflict between housing complexes, among tenant applicants looking to move into an apartment, and so forth. On the other side of the conflict, the tenants themselves are looking to get the best apartment possible for the least amount of money in rent.\n\nThe [financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp) of 2008 and the subsequent bank bailouts are good examples of real-life conflict theory, according to authors Alan Sears and James Cairns in their book *A Good Book, in Theory*. They view the financial crisis as the inevitable outcome of the inequalities and instabilities of the global economic system, which enable the largest banks and institutions to avoid government oversight and take huge risks that only reward a select few.3\n\nSears and Cairns note that large [banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank.asp) and big businesses subsequently received bailout funds from the same governments that claimed to have insufficient funds for large-scale social programs such as universal healthcare.3 This dichotomy supports a fundamental assumption of conflict theory, which is that mainstream political institutions and cultural practices favor dominant groups and individuals.\n\nThis example illustrates that conflict can be inherent in all types of relationships, including those that don't appear on the surface to be antagonistic. It also shows that even a straightforward scenario can lead to multiple layers of conflict.\n\n## What Is Conflict Theory?\n\nConflict theory is a sociopolitical theory that originated with Karl Marx. It seeks to explain political and economic events in terms of an ongoing struggle over finite resources. In this struggle, Marx emphasizes the antagonistic relationship between social classes, in particular the relationship between the owners of capital—who Marx calls the “bourgeoisie”—and the working class, which he calls the “proletariat.” Conflict theory had a profound influence on 19th- and 20th-century thought and continues to influence political debates to this day.\n\n## What Are Some Common Criticisms of Conflict Theory?\n\nOne common criticism of conflict theory is that it fails to capture the way in which economic interactions can mutually benefit the different classes involved. For example, conflict theory describes the relationship between employers and employees as one of conflict, in which the employers wish to pay as little as possible for the employees' labor, while the employees wish to maximize their wages. In practice, however, employees and employers often have a harmonious relationship. Moreover, institutions such as pension plans and stock-based compensation can further blur the boundary between workers and corporations by giving workers an additional stake in the success of their employer.\n\n## Who Is Credited With Inventing Conflict Theory?\n\nConflict theory is attributed to Karl Marx, a 19th-century political philosopher who led the development of communism as a school of thought in economics. Karl Marx’s two most famous works are *The Communist Manifesto*, which he published in 1848; and *Das Kapital*, published in 1867.4 Although he lived in the 19th century, Marx had a substantial influence on politics and economics in the 20th century and is generally considered one of history’s most influential and controversial thinkers.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuVKztCQqm9qn_QODrF0nRManxnwuADJ8wkYPIDo1jsqBDqQbZVzanY5nKQT-2AtWTf1EO7bt6Q2cMrjpfNlIL3mdIDcdxegeX8tCZmpJWNrdLQPCjMDkf8Clsdg_jbheJ_Bdvzmn9g4OzOhb5ebxeZwBL11Jk2C_x8_XbLySlNy53BicHc93luSzU99sKFFlUlYP99uuNHyP4sR5nrOv_Ykj8o-a2sTPQG_9W6lK4PvjcjKdna96wDRChgClqJmj3V2WOlYs5q1ugL-4t_L69pQw77RL6RlxcfoZOeELz6v2orghWN4kJJnxY1E94uJJvtwrji8_k0InWq&sig=Cg0ArKJSzBFQHXxdugoREAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuVKztCQqm9qn_QODrF0nRManxnwuADJ8wkYPIDo1jsqBDqQbZVzanY5nKQT-2AtWTf1EO7bt6Q2cMrjpfNlIL3mdIDcdxegeX8tCZmpJWNrdLQPCjMDkf8Clsdg_jbheJ_Bdvzmn9g4OzOhb5ebxeZwBL11Jk2C_x8_XbLySlNy53BicHc93luSzU99sKFFlUlYP99uuNHyP4sR5nrOv_Ykj8o-a2sTPQG_9W6lK4PvjcjKdna96wDRChgClqJmj3V2WOlYs5q1ugL-4t_L69pQw77RL6RlxcfoZOeELz6v2orghWN4kJJnxY1E94uJJvtwrji8_k0InWq&sig=Cg0ArKJSzBFQHXxdugoREAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

{"id": "72macf_J24M32YqVVC2SIHjxWAfDbC_MwnscdSfo-rE", "title": "Nansen对话隐秘「巨鲸」：如何成为Smart Money交易者", "body": "Nansen 团队采访了一位顶级加密交易员，并分析了他们的其中一个钱包。\n\n数月来，Zee Prime Capital 在推特的个人简介中戏称自己为「And Others Capital」（加密媒体会按名称列出知名 VC 公司的名字，而新的 VC 会被降级为「其他投资者」），该 VC 在 2020-2022 年周期的后半期成为了行业领先的投资机构，其在各种 layer 1、基础设施、DeFi 以及 P2E 项目中进行了早期投资。 \n  \n 而 Zee Prime 的崛起，在很大程度上要归功于其创始合伙人之一 Fiskantes 不断增长的知名度，而他的亮点之一是正确地预测高吞吐量区块链最终会因为 200 年前的「能源消耗悖论」而变得拥堵，他在早期就预判到了 NFT 的崛起，并为 Zee Prime 的持续成功做出了贡献。目前，Zee Prime 管理着多只基金，其中包括 2022 年完成融资的 3500 万美元旗舰基金 Zee Prime II。\n\n然而，Fiskantes 的旅程并非一帆风顺，在他取得当前的成功之前，他是一名经验丰富的扑克玩家和一名潜在的奶酪贩子，他在陷入困境的 Gouda 奶酪生意上耗尽了自己的资金。房地产投资帮助 Fiskantes 重新站稳了脚跟，他最终凭借谨慎、跨学科的方法在加密领域大放异彩。\n\n在接受 Nansen 的采访时，我们惊讶地发现 Fiskantes 广泛的专业知识在很大程度上是自学者阅读习惯的副产品。Zee Prime 是一个知名的 Smart Money NFT 钱包背后的力量，而成功的加密投资需要「在你的内心让某些东西死去」。\n\n请继续阅读，以深入了解 Fiskantes 如何进行投资，以及某个 Zee Prime 钱包的详细情况。 \n  \n **问题 1: 你是如何开始投资的？是否接受过相关培训？ \n  \n Fiskantes：**我记得在大学期间，我试着尽可能多地做暑期工作攒钱，比如在活动中当保安，在宜家的仓库工作，我也在读一些关于不为别人工作的书，比如罗伯特清崎多的以及一些非常基本的东西。学习法律对我来说变得很无聊，我开始觉得我需要做些别的事情。\n\n我发现一些股票经纪人的挑战是在我们大学推广他们的服务。他们会给你 100000 美元的测试美元进行模拟交易，你可以用它们购买一些股票。到了年底，他们会挑选出表现最好的投资组合，然后给这些测试者一些钱。\n\n我来自一个小国家的小城镇，所以我甚至不知道像我这样的家伙实际上可以购买公司的股票，所以当我意识到自己可以开一个经济账户并开始购买一些美国公司的股票时，我真的非常兴奋。然后，我随机购买了一些自己不太了解的股票，并最终得到了一个表现较好的投资组合（这纯粹是运气，我当时什么都不懂）。这就是我说的重点，『好吧，现在我需要存钱开始投资。』\n\n当时我正在网上阅读一些关于投资的文章，其中一篇是关于扑克的。这是一篇关于 PokerStrategy 公司的公关文章，上面写道：「哦，每个人都可以成为在线职业扑克玩家，每个人都可以像这样赚钱。」\n\n有趣的是，这篇文章是由我目前的一位商业合伙人 Pavel 撰写的，当时他在这家扑克公司工作。\n\n事实上，我去直布罗陀面见了这些人，因为我想和他们一起工作。这大概是 12、13 年前的事了，但我就是这样认识了一些与我一起工作的人。\n\n我一开始是为了积累免费玩扑克得到的 50 美元的促销资金，并能够在职业生涯的五到六年中积累一笔可观的资金，但我也在做兼职投资，并试图理解投资股市的意义。\n\n当时大约是 2011 年，我开始研究价值投资，这与过去 12 年中为我产生巨大回报的大多数 crypto 或股票投资非常不同。PokerStrategy 团队还建立了另一个名为 Tradimo 的交易和投资项目，我并没有深入参与其中，但我很早就参与了社区建设。\n\n他们谈论的是 Facebook IPO 和所有这些成长型科技股。我是那个试图在那里推广更多价值投资方法内容的人，但没有人真正关心。每个人都想追逐科技股，回头来看，这确实是相对更好的策略。如果我们在泡沫破灭后看看现在的回报，它仍然要比本杰明・格雷厄姆（BenjaminGraham）或沃伦・巴菲特（Warren Buffet）推荐的大多数价值投资要好。\n\n我记得我尝试过所有这些疯狂的交易，我把自己烧得很厉害，然后我回到绘图板上问，好吧，那么最好的投资方式是什么？\n\n在 Tradimo，一个来自荷兰的家伙购买了比特币，这是我第一次接触比特币，他当时说：「这是一些新事物，我们应该关注它，我们应该写文章。」\n\n我不是这个平台的真正决策者，但我说这个想法很愚蠢。让我们关注一些严肃的事情，对吗？因此，我与比特币的第一次接触，让我忽略了它整整 3 年。\n\n后来，我在接受比特币支付的在线扑克室玩了一些扑克游戏，这就是我如何慢慢进入加密领域的故事，从一个对这一切都非常悲观的怀疑论者，然后到我遇到一些加密黑客，我与他们交谈，我在 2016 年和 2017 年变得非常有意识形态驱动力和导向性，对我来说，crypto 更多的是意识形态，而不是赚钱。\n\n **问题 2: 听起来你好像同时学习了多个不同领域的多种技能。你认为这有助于你的发展吗？还是说这阻碍了你的发展？这一切是如何协同工作的？** \n **Fiskantes：**事实上，有时我会感到焦虑，原因是我知道自己没有足够的时间去学习所有我想学习的东西。\n\n谈到学习，我的性格非常开朗，但我真的很不专注，我不能花太多时间去学习一件事。\n\n而我扑克届的朋友们，他们都非常热衷于打牌，就像自闭症患者一样，他们对扑克中可能发生的每一种情况都了如指掌。所有这些数字都非常有用，但它们在其他任何地方都是无用的，就像你不能把它们送到宜家去买椅子一样。\n\n所以这些家伙，当扑克不再盈利时，他们基本上没有太多机会在 crypto 之外的其他地方转行。他们当中的很多人现在都在玩加密游戏，因为这也是一种非常有趣的游戏。这是非常不同的，但它也让你深入到一些东西。但我一直想做得更多，我一直想做生意，我一直想在外面做更多的事，比如说增加价值的事，而不仅仅是打牌。\n\n在我退出法律学习后，我学习了三年应用心理学，因为我只是想获得大学学位。另外，这对我来说真的很有意思，弄清楚人类的思维是如何运作的，尤其是当我在压力之下打扑克的时候。有时我会生气，我会停止专注，我想要了解更多。\n\n所以对我来说，学习尽可能多的不同的东西，找到自己的人生之路是非常必要的。我觉得，拥有优势要么是非常地专业化，比如说如果你投资房地产，如果你投资一个自己非常熟悉的地方，你要知道价格，你要知道行业将如何进一步发展，这当然是非常有帮助的。要么，你需要投资一些超新的、没有很好的地图的前沿领域。\n\n在 crypto 之前，我试着搞清楚虚拟现实（VR），它在 2016 年有一个小牛市或炒作周期，但它对我来说并不是真正可行的东西。有一段时间，这只是一个有趣的爱好，但我尝试了很多东西，我实际上拿了大部分从扑克上赚的钱参与投资了一家公司。\n\n这是一个我可能从未分享过的故事，但它非常有趣。东欧有一家公司，它基本上是购买像 Gouda 这样的奶酪，然后把它带到另一个国家，让这些奶酪老化几个月，然后高价出售，因为 12 个月或 24 个月的 Gouda 奶酪要比新的奶酪值钱得多。因此，你需要的只是某种安全存储的基础设施，然后你只需要将它们分发到超市、葡萄酒商店等。\n\n而这家公司从纸面上看，它的数字看起来是很棒的，我在其中投入了大量资金，我有点了解创始人，但我可能并没有真正了解他，因为后来我发现他做了很多可疑的事情，这意味着他有一笔巨额债务，而没有向任何人透露过，后来这家公司就倒闭了，我也因此损失了很多钱。\n\n那是在 2016 年左右，我越来越喜欢 crypto，不仅仅因为自己是一个使用比特币的扑克玩家，还因为我阅读了白皮书，并进行了 crypto 交易。回顾那段时间，尝试投资于美食行业或现实世界的业务，这对我来说是疯狂的，因为美食行业和这些实体行业很难渗透。\n\n因此，基本上这些业务很快就倒闭了。当我看到 crypto 时，我当然觉得它不会像过去几年那样容易。但是，在这个行业中定位仍然要比在现实世界中定位要方便得多。\n\n**问题 3：被这家奶酪公司搞砸后，你得到了什么教训？** \n **Fiskantes：**最重要的一课当然是风险管理，虽然我之前已经上过一些课，但我还是在这方面花了更多的钱。另一个问题是，纸面上的想法和数字，与实际执行之间存在巨大的差异，这就是我最大的收获。\n\n我很确定，如果这项业务是由其他人经营的，也许他们拥有更多的资源、更好的分销网络和更好的组织，我认为即使与某些科技行业相比，这项业务也会很快赚到很多钱。但这一切都与团队和执行有关，如果我在与人打交道，并与尝试建立的团队讨论业务方面更有经验，我本可以更快地发现这一点，但我没有。这与投资股票或玩扑克有很大的不同，对吧？\n\n**问题 4: 你的早期经历似乎是进入 crypto 的完美课程。你学过心理学，学过赌博策略和扑克的心理方面，你还学过市场，对此你怎么看？** \n **Fiskantes：**在某种程度上，我认为自己比我认识的一些律师或做其他事情的人准备得更好，但是，crypto 在早期还是一个如此不同的野兽，我也犯了很多错误。\n\n在奶酪生意之后，我再也没有犯过至关重要的错误。我从来没用过杠杆，或者我从来没有真正让自己因为在一个项目上投资过多而崩溃。但我也看到了这些超早期的 ICO，它们承诺了巨大的潜在市场，我投资了它们。当时我仍然对有前谷歌背景的创始人或者让 Vitalik Buterin 担任顾问这样的事印象深刻，我对其中一些项目很有把握，但它们并没有成功。\n\n是的，我认为我肯定比大多数人有更好的加密背景，即使从心态或心理学的角度来看也是如此。我真的不介意波动，我不介意赔钱，对我来说，这很正常。我不会花太多时间关注价格图表，也不会沉迷于比特币下一步的发展方向，而这是一种优势。\n\n **问题 5: 我们讨论了从中吸取教训的早期损失。那是否有任何显著的早期胜利影响了你的观点？** \n **Fiskantes：**我的股票价值投资策略还可以，但它从未真正产生过任何巨大的回报，所以我基本上放弃了，进入了 ETF 被动投资阵营。因此，尽管它表现还不错，但我不会说我的股票表现太好，但我早期最大的成功可能是在 2014 年买了一套公寓。\n\n当时买一套公寓对我来说是一笔巨大的投资。我有抵押贷款，但只能贷 50%。我用现金支付了其余的费用，当时我想，好吧，这可能是我一生当中最大的交易之一，所以我需要真正把它变为重要的东西并加以关注。现在，这个数字与我这些天所做的相比，甚至并没有那么大，但在当时这是一笔巨款。\n\n实际上，我花了很多时间去进行尽职调查。我雇了一位顾问，所以当我们去看交易时，我会付给他相当合理的报酬。他会随身携带工具，测量墙壁的湿度，看看窗户是否隔音良好，他会检查所有东西，并就我应该谈判多少钱给我建议。在我买房的过程中，他起到了非常重要的作用，我看了至少 30 套左右的公寓，然后我买了一套起初看起来非常糟糕的公寓。\n\n它位于城镇的一个相当不错的地区，但看起来很糟糕。就像如果你是一个根据情绪做出决定的人，或者喜欢事物的感觉和外观，那你就不会买它。这家伙对我说，好吧，这是迄今为止我们见过的最好的地方。我知道这看起来很糟糕，但是重建起来很容易，而且结构上一切都很好。它位于一个很棒的街区，价格也很棒，他建议我马上买，所以我就买了。\n\n然后我计划重建这个房子，我雇佣了一些工人，是的，5 年后，在我出售这个房子时获得了比当时房地产市场平均回报大的多的回报。它实际上是物理世界中的某种东西，我可以看到它被实时重建。这种感觉真的很好，我想也许我可以在这方面做更多的房地产投资。但后来 crypto 变得火爆，我基本上放弃了这个想法，但这可能是我最大的非 crypto 投资胜利，这不仅仅是运气，实际上我做了我的尽职调查，并且这些调查都是正确的。\n\n **问题 6: 我在这里听到的一个一致的主题是与专家对话，当你第一次接触扑克时，你去了直布罗陀，然后你购买了房子，你请了顾问。这些事你还在做吗？在 Zee Prime 决定一项投资之前，你们会引进行业专家吗？你现在如何进行尽职调查？** \n **Fiskantes：**这有点不同，我的意思是，crypto 是一个快速发展的新兴行业，你并没有像其他行业那样的专家。但是，例如，我们最近一直在关注的游戏，主要是因为我们的一些合作人，尤其是我之前提到的 Pavel，这个来自直布罗陀扑克公司的家伙，他建立了这家巨大的游戏公司，不仅是为了扑克，还有其他一些游戏。他担任游戏领域公司的高管已经 11 年了，所以他知道游戏，知道如何让游戏变得有趣和有利可图，他比现在投资加密游戏的绝大多数 VC 都要懂的多。所以这是一个幸运的巧合，我们有这个人在船上，但他也有电子竞技界的联系人，所以我们可以雇佣更多的人。\n\n为此，我们建立了自己的小团队，现在专注于游戏。除此之外，我们正在招聘，我不会说是专家，但我们从传统金融领域聘请了非常聪明、年轻和饥渴的人才，他们现在正在分析一些 DeFi 机会。早期，我们更像是一群来自不同背景的乌合之众，但现在，随着我们的规模不断扩大，我们正试图有条不紊地建立一个团队或一组人员，他们直接专注于我们投资的各个领域。\n\n无论我们做什么（也许我们很幸运，但我们正在获得很多回报），我们不想完全转向，但可能会将我们的投资扩展到我们认为推动人类文明进步所必需的其他领域。\n\n因此，我们可能会聘请一些外部专家和顾问来帮助我们在这方面进行投资，也许会更被动一些，不像我们在 crypto 方面那样亲力亲为，但也许未来三到七年，我们会考虑这些……我不想透露太多，因为这只是我们内部的头脑风暴。但是，你知道，我们谈论的是某种核能或替代能源，尤其是现在俄罗斯的情况。我们认为，欧洲在梦想其他能源和热源时需要某种复兴。\n\n因此，如果有足够的资本，我们可以帮助实现这一目标。话虽如此，我们不是这方面的专家，也永远不会是。因此，我们可能需要一些外部帮助并更加被动地投资。\n\n **问题 7: 这是你在采访中多次提到的事情，我看到你在 twitter 上谈论过这件事。带着更高的目标投资似乎是你的动力。** \n **Fiskantes：**是的，我的意思是，翻转币是有趣的。我也参与了翻转，尤其是 NFT。这很有趣，但从来都不是主要的动力。一段时间后，你会意识到，如果你买了一艘更大的游艇，如果你的屏幕上显示的数字更大，你不会感到更快乐，或者我不知道其他人会用金钱做什么，但你可以做的是，要么停止过于专注于你的职业和投资，去开始做其他的事，比如关注你的健康和人际关系，或者至少要有更高的目标，为什么你要收集所有这些数字，以及将来如何处理它们。\n\n我有点想同时做这两件事。我和我的合伙人都认为，我们需要回馈或确定人类进步可能不发达的领域，或者资本可能以某种方式分配不当或效率低下，我们将努力找出如何以不同的方式思考这些问题，如何将它们转移到对我们所有人都更有利的地方。\n\n这感觉有点陈词滥调，但我觉得归根结底，这是最纯粹的激励形式。你必须拥有比自己更大的东西，并尝试帮助一些可能比你活得更长的东西。\n\n这将是 crypto 的方式。有意思的是，这么多人这么早就变得非常富有，而不需要建立一家公司 20 年。我想我们会看到越来越多的这种想法，因为我们还年轻，我们还想再活一次，我不知道，50、60、70、80 岁。我们不想在我们长大后看到世界在熊熊烈火中燃烧。所以我认为从纯粹的「让我们把数字上升到某事」的心态转变为让我们生活在一个更绿色、更愉快的世界更有意义。\n\n **问题 8: crypto 领域有了那么多天才，你认为有些人天生就适合做交易吗？这是可以学习的吗？** \n **Fiskantes：**我认为你需要有一些东西才能做到这一点。好吧，其中有很多人都是经过培训的，如果人们从小没有受过培训，或者不习惯冒很大的风险，那么他们在数字方面就做得不好。\n\n尤其是交易，在这种情况下，你真的会盯着屏幕，并试图在一个充满噪音的环境中，非常非常快地做出关于大量资金的快速决定。你有点需要某种……我不知道，我不想听起来愤世嫉俗。但你的内心需要让某种东西死去。\n\n**问题 9：有什么东西需要在你的内心死去吗？** \n **Fiskantes：**有些东西需要在你的内心死去，你知道，有些人一想到钱就会很激动。我们和扑克玩家一起玩这个游戏，我们去酒吧喝一些饮料，然后让调酒师掷硬币。如果我们输了，我们将付出三倍的代价。或者如果我们赢了，我们什么都不需要付，调酒师需要用自己的钱来弥补。\n\n大多数人都非常厌恶风险，对他们来说，亏损的概念比赢得更多金额的愿景更痛苦。所以我觉得你需要做一个可能对风险不会有太多感知的人，但同时，你不应该倾向于赌博。许多人沉迷于数字的多巴胺增加，疯狂地上下波动。\n\n所以对我来说，这些数字并不那么有趣。我会去玩扑克，但那只是一种磨练。我会每天坐着玩几个小时，然后愉快地去做其他事情。有些人只是被粘住了，他们无法离开桌子。你知道的，当行动强大或其他的时候。\n\n **问题 10：那什么对你来说是痛苦的？在交易中，一定有一些东西会让你心碎，什么会让你心痛？** \n **Fiskantes：**比如说，我没有因为草率的原因而投资某些东西，或者因为草率的原因我错过了一些东西。当一切都在快速上升时，我会因为大量的机会而感到有点不知所措。是的，犯草率的错误是痛苦的，即使是我。\n\n但另一件事，这更多是从投资的角度来看，我看到的另一件痛苦的事情是，我同情那些承受巨大压力的构建者，他们肩负着创造重要、有趣和创新事物的重任，这些人受到如此多的仇恨和压力。你知道，有时候我只是想抛售一些币或一些可能做得不太好的东西。但我只是觉得这些人正在努力工作。而我们只是在这里来回翻动他们的Token。\n\n所以当我看到非常好的项目有非常好的和善意的团队时，我觉得这有点痛苦，他们正在苦苦挣扎，因为 Token 只是因为时间和社区的原因在下跌。是的，那是我想离开行业或长时间休息的时候，它通常与这样的事情有关。\n\n我会认为自己是混乱中立的，这意味着有时我只是想让事情以奇怪的方式解决并引起轰动，甚至可能成为头条新闻，只是因为我想看看这个行业来测试它的极限。\n\n我们支持创始人，即使他们可能有古怪的个性，或者他们的设计有缺陷，他们可能应该更积极地解决这个问题。但我会偏向于那些大起大落、尝试做一些有趣和新鲜事的人。所以有时候，即使事情没有解决，但人们谈论得很多，我就会觉得行业在向前发展。所以有时候我会很奇怪，但通常我最大的乐趣是当我看到一些事情以一种非预期的方式实现时，它会让人们的生活变得更好。\n\n**问题 11：当我浏览 Nansen 时，我有点惊讶，我们没有标记很多 Zee Prime 的钱包，你们是否经常考虑秘密作战？** \n **Fiskantes：**说到 OPSEC，因为我可能是我们团队中最公开的人物，我个人除了自己的资金外，甚至没有控制任何实质性的资金，比如说，我有时会用小额资金自己测试一些东西。我玩过一些 NFT，但我个人并没有很多钱包的直接控制权。我可能在一些多重签名上作为了备份，但我自己甚至都不主动签名。我认为自己肩负了最大的目标，所以我非常非常小心。 \n  \n 所以你可以把你所有乱七八糟的 PDF 都寄给我，我甚至会打开它，但你不会从中得到些什么。也许是一些 Forgotten Runes Wizards。\n\n**问题 12: 让我们来谈谈 NFT，我正在查看你的个人帐户历史，在去年 10 月 21 日左右，你的地址活动激增了，你开始玩 NFT 游戏，这些市场有什么让你特别感兴趣的吗？ \n Fiskantes：**在我们团队内部，我对 NFT 的态度是非常与众不同的。几乎所有人都说：「不，这只是一种奇怪的时尚。谁在乎拥有一张像素化的图片呢？」我说，「好吧，我需要深入挖掘，看看是否有什么东西。」\n\n这对我来说也很有趣，在正常的可替代交易市场上，你只能使用机器人进行套利，但在 Opensea 上，你可以使用非常受限且速度缓慢的订单进行各种有趣的事情。\n\n当我玩扑克时，东欧有一个自营交易平台正在招聘交易员，他们准备在华沙证券交易平台和维也纳证券交易平台积极交易——股票流动性非常低的小型交易平台。因此，你可以手动完成这些做市操作，而且你可以通过使用非常愚蠢的算法赚很多钱。因此，作为一名扑克玩家，我被雇来试用，并在那里学会了一些如何使用订单簿的技巧。\n\n我在那里呆了三个星期，我意识到我不想去任何办公室穿衬衫或类似的东西，于是我辞职了，但我学到了一些技巧。所以去年我发现，你可以在 NFT 中使用这些技巧，因为这些市场流动性很低，很难实现自动化。所以我就这么做了，但实际上我也只是想买一些彩票，看看有没有什么会突然出现。在开始的时候，我只花了很少的钱就买了一个 CryptoPunk 和其他一些东西。\n\n \n 订单簿策略实际上并没有那么复杂。顺便说一句，你可以在 2017 年初或 2016 年底在 Kraken 上执行此操作。基本上，你所做的是，你会看到某些资产的买卖订单之间存在很大的价差，例如，Parallel 的 Prime Keys，并且有一段时间你可以同时以 10 E 的价格买入并以 12 E 的价格卖出。你可以同时进行两种交易，这样，你每周就可以赚取几次价差。 \n  \n 我并不是经常这样做，但我确实是这么去想的，好吧，这是一个可行的策略，如果没有超高的以太坊费用，那这可能是学习如何进行此类交易的最佳场所，所以它不适合所有人。\n\n有时，当有人偶然挂出了一些具有罕见特征的东西时，我也会尝试做稀有或地板狙击。你很快就买了它，然后你可以在以后卖掉它。我也这样做了，如果我真的专注于此，我想我可以在这项活动中获得相当不错的回报。但那时我们已经在运营我们的基金，我对整天点击一些东西并不感兴趣（这是我五年来一直在玩扑克的事情，所以我不想在我的余生中一直这样做）。\n\n现在我觉得 NFT 市场已经让我不知所措了，这里到处都是模仿者，不像我以前玩的时候那么令人兴奋。不管怎样，在玩过之后，我基本上回到了我的团队的其他成员那里，并且能够推销他们，不是直接购买太多的 NFT，而是更仔细地研究一些 NFT 游戏项目或 NFT 基础设施项目，并为我们想买的东西制定一个理论。 \n\n**问题 13：很多人认为，像你这样强大的市场参与者在幕后控制着整个行业。这在多大程度上是真实的？**\n\n**Fiskantes：**我并不是很多私人团体中的那种内部人士。如果有任何聊天组如此重要，以至于它们可以推动整个市场，那我绝对不在其中。\n\n可悲的是，我觉得这是一个混合问题，肯定有幕后交易、内幕信息以及其他类型的东西，比方说，许多大玩家都会有 alpha 来源。但我认为这与其他行业也没有什么不同。只是行业呈指数级上升，而且它是如此的新，以至于利用即使是很小的不对称信息，也比在某些非常传统的行业中要容易得多。\n\n我想说的是，相比四五年前，现在的我有点厌倦了，没有那么满眼星光、天真和意识形态化，当时我更倾向于相信所有 crypto 都是为了让机会平等，让一切变得更加去中心化和民主。\n\n在某些方面，它仍在朝着这个方向发展。世界上任何地方的每个人，都可以建立智能合约，这对每个人来说都是一个平等的机会。那么共同点只是纯粹的艺术技巧，即在没有任何支持的情况下弄清楚如何比其他人更好地玩 DeFi/MEV 游戏。如果游戏是全球性的，它可以在任何地方。你只需要你的电脑，然后你就可以在你妈妈的地下室赚取到十位数。\n\n \n\n### 钱包分析\n\n 作为采访的一部分，Fiskantes 讨论了 Zee Primes 的一些重大投资硕果，包括早期的 Synthetix 和 Solana 投资，以及在 1 美元的时候购买了 Luna。\n\n然而，Fiskantes 还透露，Zee Prime 是一个越来越复杂的组织，有多个其他实体在同一屋檐下运作。这包括 Sigil，一种专注于 DeFi

{"id": "tyiaX8g76wccgvKu-xtpfjOAG9k0BLLam2JU4DlUwPE", "title": "How to valuate ETH as a bond (20220607 update) ", "body": "## In Arthur Hayes’ [Five Ducking Digits](https://medium.com/@cryptohayes/five-ducking-digits-cd92a7ab72ce) he proposes a framework to valuate ETH as a bond post the Merge. This article offers an update of that valuation based on updated Ethereum’s official PoS staking yield.\n\nAs a tradfi banking analyst (i.e. I follow the banking sector), my daily job has been following the fundmantal trends and reflect them in my valuation models. <https://twitter.com/mishleeee>\n\n## Conclusions from my exercise:\n\n**The staking income offers good buffer for the ETH investment in USD term should ETH price remain volatile.**\n\n**A base case scenario assuming ETH as a perpetual bond with 1) 6.9% long-term staking yield; 2) 3% discount rate as your funding cost, fair value = $4,370, 130% upside from current $ 1,900.**\n\nYou can play around with [my model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\\_bkW9uo7NYPPKiaSyswGtbi_v6j-Nk8\\_/edit?usp=sharing\\&ouid=100007872474593135826\\&rtpof=true\\&sd=true).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*hCn2rxv3iuiOJyOtGqH35Q.png)\n\nFigure 1: ETH fair value scenario analysis\n\n## **ETH as a bond**\n\nArthur Hayes framework is interesting in that it could very much become the reality and sometime in the future institutional investors are going to offer ETH linked product to their clients as a quasi-fixed income investment. [link](https://medium.com/@cryptohayes/five-ducking-digits-cd92a7ab72ce)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2fabP5n9hBiiGyTeu38OEQ.png)\n\nFigure 2: ETH: Number of addresses with balance ≥32 ETH; Source: [Glassnode](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=ETH\\&category=Distribution\\&m=addresses.Min32Count\\&resolution=1month\\&s=1590705360\\&u=1654560000\\&zoom=)\n\nHowever there are a few things can be improved\n\n1.  Arthur uses the staking yield at the Merge of 8% — 11.5% as the long term return for validators, which may not be sustainable as more validators join the scene and share the rewards; according to the latest staking reward prediction published Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, the long term base case scenario yield is actually 5.4% [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0).\n2.  he uses US treasury yield as the discount rate for the valuation, which is much lower than what we use for corporate bonds (ETH’s creditworthy in the eyes of a typical institutions is lower than US government); we need to apply a higher discount ;\n3.  his price target looks weird in that he directly applies current price to the present value (PV) of 32ETH initial investment and arrive at a range of price target. Let’s not blame Arthur as we all know he is not a bond expert.\n\nI don’t think everybody reads his tables easily. It’s the same for me! So, let me explain in a bit more details.\n\n## The discounted cash flow model\n\nThis exercise employs a valuation model called “present value”, which discounts back the future cash flows of an investment.\n\nAssuming post the Merge a validator would lock in 32 ETH and in return she receives continous validator rewards. And at the end of her investment period, let’s say 5 years, she decides to withdraw her ETH and cease to be a validator. The investment horizon could vary depending on how you think about ETH validator’s horizon.\n\nIn next 5 years the cash flow stream would look like below — the continous validator rewards as well as a lumpsum return of capital of 32 ETH at the end of the 5th year.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*oS8H0\\_dAfC6DUlgIClUgAg.png)\n\nFigure 3: 5 year cash flow of a validator and the present value calculation\n\nTo arrive at the present value we just need to discount these cash flows with a discount rate, using 3.11% for the table above. Add them all together we arrive at 35.3ETH, which is higher than our initial investment of 32 ETH. This investment has generated a positive net present value as the long term return of 5.4% (can think of it as a bond coupon rate) is higher than the required return (discount rate) 3.11%. If the discount rate rises higher to exceed 5.4%, our investment will present a negative present value. Because the return rate is lower than the required return to compensate investors for the risks they are taking. This is exactly why some bonds are trading at discount to its face value of 100.\n\n## The sensitivity analysis\n\nA few parameters affect our valuation\n\n1.  Your investment horizon: In the exercise I have 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years and perpetual scenarios.\n2.  Your discount rate: I used US treasury yield of same duration plus 50 basis points as the discount rate. Remember, the level of discount rate would affect the net present value. Depending on how much you think about your cost of borrowing and your required return on this investment. An investor with 2.5% borrowing cost and one with 4.5% borrowing cost would arrive at very different conclusion.\n3.  Staking yield: I offered a range from 9.10% to 3.3% which is the range offered by Justin Drake for both immediately after the merge and for the long run. His spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ShTwNvpn4egJqqAFRVnnARqNhFCdRw8q/edit?usp=sharing\\&ouid=100007872474593135826\\&rtpof=true\\&sd=true).\n\nI inclulde a range of sensitivity analysis to test the results under different scenarios.\n\n1.  **Present value of a validator locking up her 32 ETH. **You would notice under some scenarios when the funding cost is higher than the staking yield, the present value is falling below 32 ETH. It basically says when the yield on your assets is lower than your borrowing cost, this investment is loss-making. Imagine when the rental yield is lower than your mortgage cost, without price appreciation, would you invest in a property like that?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dr_CjD6f2\\_ollY7BrN3YSA.png)\n\nFigure 4: FigurePresent value of 32 ETH investment\n\n2\\. % return to initial capital.

If 32 ETH investment can create more value, then it’s fair value should reflect such value creation. Here the math is simple, fair value = spot ETH price \\* present value in ETH from Figure 3\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*hCn2rxv3iuiOJyOtGqH35Q.png)\n\nFigure 6: Implied fair value of ETH\n\n4.ETH breakeven price. Since for majority of the cases, 32 ETH is going to come back with>32 ETH, that offers you some buffer in USD term should ETH price retreat in the future. Entry price at spot is$1900, if investing for 5 year with 8% staking yield, at a 2.95% funding cost, you can sustain ETH price down to $1576 and still make money. Your staking yield offsets the price correction.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*018T2O-K4YCEXS7mJhs3Jg.png)\n\nFigure 7: ETH breakeven price\n\nHope you like this framework.\n\nFor more fundamental analysis on crypto and macro, follow me on twitter <https://twitter.com/mishleeee>\n", "timestamp": 1654656433, "digest": "JoVoKh6TV2zWNORPjFwFaf-Mjp72NHY4YvxfJiJkUHQ", "contributor": "0xACD74a7F90734026081C9D3191d7B1471B05c442"}
{"id": "0YWKVXh8fl_bnd7dgTOpYKNygCbB8NfTvQjHwUP3Udk", "title": "Correlation Coefficient", "body": "## What Is the Correlation Coefficient?\n\nThe correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables. The values range between -1.0 and 1.0. A calculated number greater than 1.0 or less than -1.0 means that there was an error in the correlation measurement. A correlation of -1.0 shows a perfect [negative correlation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-correlation.asp), while a correlation of 1.0 shows a perfect [positive correlation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/positive-correlation.asp). A correlation of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the movement of the two variables.\n\nCorrelation statistics can be used in finance and investing. For example, a correlation coefficient could be calculated to determine the level of correlation between the price of crude oil and the stock price of an oil-producing company, such as Exxon Mobil Corporation. Since oil companies earn greater profits as oil prices rise, the correlation between the two variables is highly positive.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Correlation coefficients are used to measure the strength of the relationship between two variables.\n* Pearson correlation is the one most commonly used in statistics. This measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.\n* Values always range between -1 (strong negative relationship) and +1 (strong positive relationship). Values at or close to zero imply a weak or no linear relationship.\n* Correlation coefficient values less than +0.8 or greater than -0.8 are not considered significant.\n\n## Understanding the Correlation Coefficient\n\nThere are several types of correlation coefficients, but the one that is most common is the Pearson correlation (*r*). This measures the strength and direction of the [linear relationship](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/linearrelationship.asp) between two variables. It cannot capture nonlinear relationships between two variables and cannot differentiate between dependent and independent variables.1\n\nA value of exactly 1.0 means there is a perfect positive relationship between the two variables. For a positive increase in one variable, there is also a positive increase in the second variable. A value of -1.0 means there is a perfect negative relationship between the two variables. This shows that the variables move in opposite directions—for a positive increase in one variable, there is a decrease in the second variable. If the correlation between two variables is 0, there is no linear relationship between them.\n\nThe strength of the relationship varies in degree based on the value of the correlation coefficient. For example, a value of 0.2 shows there is a positive correlation between two variables, but it is weak and likely unimportant. Analysts in some fields of study do not consider correlations important until the value surpasses at least 0.8. However, a correlation coefficient with an absolute value of 0.9 or greater would represent a very strong relationship.2\n\nInvestors can use changes in correlation statistics to identify new trends in the financial markets, the economy, and stock prices.\n\n## Correlation Statistics and Investing\n\nThe correlation between two variables is particularly helpful when investing in the financial markets. For example, a correlation can be helpful in determining how well a mutual fund performs relative to its benchmark index, or another fund or asset class. By adding a low or negatively correlated mutual fund to an existing portfolio, the investor gains [diversification](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp) benefits.\n\nIn other words, investors can use negatively correlated assets or securities to hedge their portfolios and reduce market risk due to volatility or wild price fluctuations. Many investors hedge the price risk of a portfolio, which effectively reduces any capital gains or losses because they want the dividend income or yield from the stock or security.\n\nCorrelation statistics also allow investors to determine when the correlation between two variables changes. For example, bank stocks typically have a highly positive correlation to interest rates, since loan rates are often calculated based on market interest rates. If the stock price of a certain bank is falling while interest rates are rising, investors can glean that something's askew with that particular bank. If the stock prices of other banks in the sector are also rising, investors can conclude that the decline of the outlier bank's stock is not due to interest rates. Instead, the poorly performing bank is likely dealing with an internal, fundamental issue.\n\n## Correlation Coefficient Equation\n\nTo calculate the Pearson product-moment correlation, one must first determine the covariance of the two variables in question. Next, one must calculate each variable's standard deviation. The correlation coefficient is determined by dividing the covariance by the product of the two variables' standard deviations.\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\rho_{xy} = \\\\frac { \\\\text{Cov} ( x, y ) }{ \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\rho_{xy} = \\\\text{Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Cov} ( x, y ) = \\\\text{covariance of variables } x \\\\text{ and } y \\\\\\\\ &\\\\sigma_x = \\\\text{standard deviation of } x \\\\\\\\ &\\\\sigma_y = \\\\text{standard deviation of } y \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​*ρxy*​=*σx*​*σy*​Cov(*x*,*y*)​where:*ρxy*​=Pearson product-moment correlation coefficientCov(*x*,*y*)=covariance of variables *x* and *yσx*​=standard deviation of *xσy*​=standard deviation of *y*​\n\nStandard deviation is a measure of the [dispersion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dispersion.asp) of data from its average. Covariance is a measure of how two variables change together, but its magnitude is unbounded, so it is difficult to interpret. By dividing covariance by the product of the two standard deviations, one can calculate the normalized version of the statistic. This is the correlation coefficient.2\n\n## What Is Meant by the Correlation Coefficient?\n\nThe correlation coefficient describes how one variable moves in relation to another. A positive correlation indicates that the two move in the same direction, with a +1.0 correlation when they move in tandem. A negative correlation coefficient tells you that they instead move in opposite directions. A correlation of zero suggests no correlation at all.\n\n## How Do You Calculate the Correlation Coefficient?\n\nThe correlation coefficient is calculated by first determining the covariance of the variables and then dividing that quantity by the product of those variables’ standard deviations.\n\n## How Is the Correlation Coefficient Used in Investing?\n\nCorrelation coefficients are a widely-used statistical measure in investing. They play a very important role in areas such as portfolio composition, quantitative trading, and performance evaluation. For example, some portfolio managers will monitor the correlation coefficients of individual assets in their portfolios in order to ensure that the total volatility of their portfolios is maintained within acceptable limits.\n\n \n \n\nSimilarly, analysts will sometimes use correlation coefficients to predict how a particular asset will be impacted by a change to an external factor, such as the price of a commodity or an interest rate.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvSVIbthWyM4COKsRfiZrttdnxkxc7A6TqSrBcC6O5uedQKLX2lsR8hkfzndQBuLsNVkoRO4fMe6LR3Q-wrjr11H9xcm2sc-FKRvJ5TDVIFGcUVFwG6S53Hbyz6Zn1n4mbVylDFGwaDzimSLXpEERkHgF3chgA1uUwbGIIRzsdRj_fLZktbruoeKg7SDzwqniKOkNKFOYi7gAgTMTYejkbhq2yzBgtOE37--Of1ClG8wDPP5w7dI_Nm1jT3GUh9hP9n8jDx-VyXCYyAfKA7iKBlLVU1Nb2SqwuNo_Eze-GN85x8-4erEBPVuDgxmVD88k9J7W5aO5QIqBonPpHRg6zSrHVH97RoemLRT16rxtxUHec&sig=Cg0ArKJSzGvBRFTc9XFqEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvSVIbthWyM4COKsRfiZrttdnxkxc7A6TqSrBcC6O5uedQKLX2lsR8hkfzndQBuLsNVkoRO4fMe6LR3Q-wrjr11H9xcm2sc-FKRvJ5TDVIFGcUVFwG6S53Hbyz6Zn1n4mbVylDFGwaDzimSLXpEERkHgF3chgA1uUwbGIIRzsdRj_fLZktbruoeKg7SDzwqniKOkNKFOYi7gAgTMTYejkbhq2yzBgtOE37--Of1ClG8wDPP5w7dI_Nm1jT3GUh9hP9n8jDx-VyXCYyAfKA7iKBlLVU1Nb2SqwuNo_Eze-GN85x8-4erEBPVuDgxmVD88k9J7W5aO5QIqBonPpHRg6zSrHVH97RoemLRT16rxtxUHec&sig=Cg0ArKJSzGvBRFTc9XFqEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "CC9TmdeEqWPQBOWmspTAA1y4Q1QpnELKR2frXEnYdq0", "title": "Irrevocable Trust", "body": "## What Is an Irrevocable Trust?\n\nThe term irrevocable trust refers to a type of [trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp) where its terms cannot be modified, amended, or terminated without the permission of the grantor's [beneficiary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp) or beneficiaries. The grantor, having effectively transferred all ownership of assets into the trust, legally removes all of their rights of ownership to the assets and the trust.\n\nIrrevocable trusts are generally set up to minimize estate taxes, access government benefits, and protect assets. This is in contrast to a [revocable trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revocabletrust.asp), which allows the grantor to modify the trust, but loses certain benefits such as creditor protection.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Irrevocable trusts cannot be modified, amended, or terminated without permission from the grantor's beneficiaries.\n* The grantor transfers all ownership of assets into the trust and legally removes all of their ownership rights to the assets and the trust. \n* Living and testamentary trusts are two types of irrevocable trusts.\n* These trusts offer tax-shelter benefits that revocable trusts do not.\n* Under the SECURE Act, some beneficiaries may have to take a full distribution by the end of the tenth calendar year following the year of the grantor's death.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 40 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:40\n\n#### Irrevocable Trust\n\n## How an Irrevocable Trust Works\n\nIrrevocable trusts are primarily set up for estate and tax considerations. That's because it removes all [incidents of ownership](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incidentsofownership.asp), removing the trust's assets from the grantor's [taxable estate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableestate.asp). It also relieves the grantor of the tax liability on the income generated by the assets.12 While the tax rules vary between jurisdictions, the grantor can't receive these benefits if they are the trustee. The assets held in the trust can include (but are not limited to) a business, investment assets, cash, and life insurance policies.\n\nTrusts have an important place in estate and legacy planning. But there is a downside: the cost. Setting up any type of trust can be complicated enough that an attorney is necessary. And this means that people may end up spending a few thousand dollars or more in attorney fees to set them up.\n\nIrrevocable trusts are especially useful to individuals who work in professions that may make them vulnerable to lawsuits, such as doctors or attorneys. Once an asset is transferred to such a trust, it is owned by the trust for the benefit of its beneficiaries. Therefore, it is safe from legal judgments and [creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp) since the trust will not be a party to any lawsuit.\n\nToday’s irrevocable trusts come with many provisions that were not commonly found in older versions of these instruments. These additions allow for much greater flexibility in trust management and distribution of assets. Provisions such as decanting, which allows a trust to be moved into a newer trust with more modern or advantageous provisions, can ensure that the trust [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) will be managed effectively. Other features that allow the trust to change its state of domicile can provide additional tax savings or other benefits.\n\nAlthough they are commonly associated with the very wealthy, trusts are [an important piece of estate planning for anyone](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/set-up-a-trust-fund.asp)—regardless of income status.\n\n## Types of Irrevocable Trusts\n\nIrrevocable trusts come in two forms: living trusts and testamentary trusts.\n\nA [living trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/living-trust.asp), which is also known as an *inter vivos* (Latin for \"between the living\") trust, is originated and funded by an individual during their lifetime. Some living trust examples are:\n\n* Irrevocable life insurance trust\n* [Grantor-retained annuity trust (GRAT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grat.asp), spousal lifetime access trust (SLAT), and [qualified personal residence trust (QPRT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualified-personal-residence-trust.asp) (all types of lifetime gifting trusts)\n* [Charitable remainder trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/charitableremaindertrust.asp) and [charitable lead trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/charitableleadtrust.asp) (both forms of charitable trusts)\n\n[Testamentary trusts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/testamentarytrust.asp), on the other hand, are irrevocable by design. That's because they are created after the death of their creator and are funded from the deceased's estate according to the terms of their [will](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/what-is-a-will.asp). The sole way to make changes to a testamentary trust (or cancel it) is to alter the will of the trust's creator before they die.\n\n## Irrevocable Trust Basics\n\nAn irrevocable trust has a [grantor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grantor.asp), a trustee, and a beneficiary or beneficiaries. Once the grantor places an asset in an irrevocable trust, it is a gift to the trust and the grantor cannot revoke it. The grantor can dictate the terms, rules, and uses of the trust assets with the consent of the [trustee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustee.asp) and the beneficiary.3\n\nIrrevocable trusts can have many applications in planning for the preservation and distribution of an estate, including:\n\n* To take advantage of the [estate tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estatetax.asp) exemption and remove taxable assets from the estate. Property transferred to an irrevocable living trust does not count toward the gross value of an estate. Such trusts can be especially helpful in reducing the tax liability of very large estates.\n* To prevent beneficiaries from misusing assets, the grantor can set conditions for distribution.\n* To gift assets to the estate while still retaining the income from the assets.\n* To remove [appreciable assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp) from the estate while still providing beneficiaries with a step-up basis in valuing the assets for tax purposes.\n* To gift a [principal residence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principalresidence.asp) to children under more favorable tax rules.\n* To house a [life insurance policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp) that would effectively remove the death proceeds from the estate.\n* To deplete one's property to ensure eligibility for government benefits, such as Social Security income and Medicaid (for nursing home care). Such trusts can also be used to help secure benefits and care for a special needs child by preventing disqualification of eligibility.\n\nAn irrevocable trust is a more complex legal arrangement than a revocable trust. Because there could be current income tax and future estate tax implications when using an irrevocable trust, seek a tax or estate attorney's guidance.\n\n## Irrevocable Trusts vs. Revocable Trusts\n\nRevocable trusts may be amended or canceled at any time as long as their creator is mentally competent. They do offer the benefit of allowing their creator to cancel them and reclaim [property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property.asp) held by the trust at any time before death. However, such trusts do not offer the same protection against legal action or estate taxes as irrevocable trusts.4\n\nWhen using revocable trusts, government entities will consider that any property held in one still belongs to the trust's creator and therefore may be included in their estate for tax purposes or when qualifying for government benefits.4 Once a revocable trust's creator dies, the trust becomes irrevocable.3\n\n## SECURE Act Rules\n\nThe [Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act](https://www.investopedia.com/secure-act-4688468) changes some of the tax-saving benefits of [see-through trusts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seethrough-trust.asp).\n\nPreviously, certain non-spousal beneficiaries of retirement accounts that had been placed in an irrevocable trust could take their distributions over their life expectancy. However, under the SECURE Act rules, some beneficiaries may find they must take a full distribution by the end of the tenth calendar year following the year of the grantor's death.5\n\nAgain, because the tax implications of this can be challenging and can change with the passage of new laws, it's important to consult a tax or estate attorney's guidance when using an irrevocable trust.\n\n## How Does an Irrevocable Trust Work?\n\nAn irrevocable trust cannot be changed or modified without the beneficiary's permission. Essentially, an irrevocable trust removes certain assets from a grantor’s taxable estate, and these incidents of ownership are transferred to a trust. A grantor may choose this structure to relieve assets in the trust from tax liabilities, along with other financial benefits.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between an Irrevocable and a Revocable Trust?\n\nFirst, irrevocable trusts cannot be changed or altered. Among the primary reasons they are used is for tax reasons, where the assets in the trust are not taxed on income generated in the trust, along with taxes in the event of the benefactor's death.21 Revocable trusts, on the other hand, can change. Beneficiaries may be removed and stipulations may be modified, along with other terms and management of the trust. However, when the owner of the trust dies, the assets held in the trust realize state and federal estate taxes.64\n\n## Who Controls an Irrevocable Trust?\n\nUnder an irrevocable trust, legal ownership of the trust is held by a trustee. At the same time, the grantor gives up certain rights to the trust. Once an irrevocable trust is established, the grantor cannot control or change the assets once they have been transferred into the trust without the beneficiary's permission. These assets can include a business, property, financial assets, or a life insurance policy.\n\n## How Much Does an Irrevocable Trust Cost to Set Up?\n\nAn irrevocable trust should be established through a trained attorney and can cost between $3,000 and $6,000. Because irrevocable trusts are often more complex and nuanced than revocable trusts, they tend to be more expensive to set up. The cost for revocable trusts typically ranges from $1,000 to $1,500.", "timestamp": 1654656535, "digest": "wHa1PuTArXmd-5pu2zYYSgYKbHU2ptuesj7_NKnc3o4", "contributor": "0x7b98FEDE91018f32Ae2B65f659F1e4D0C24E532f"}
{"id": "cRf2X6PIyphcl0I6TBVTkL8-CrhTeLj3txgPRN-MQdg", "title": "Income", "body": "## What Is Income?\n\nIncome is defined in different ways depending on the context—for example, for purposes of taxation, financial accounting, or economic analysis. For individuals and businesses, income generally means the value or amount that they receive for their labor and products.\n\nIndividuals generally consider their gross income to equal the total of their earnings in the form of wages and salaries, the return on their investments and sales of property, and other receipts. Their net income is composed of their gross income reduced by costs incurred in producing the income.\n\nSimilarly, businesses generally treat their total receipts from services, products, and any interest and dividends received with respect to their cash accounts and reserves related to the business as their [gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp). Businesses’ [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp)—i.e., profit—is determined by reducing their gross income by their business expenses.  \n\nEconomists study income in varied contexts that employ different definitions and ways of measuring income.  Whether their studies involve earnings, savings, consumption, production, public finance, [capital investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-investment.asp), or other related topics and subtopics, their concept of income will correspond to the purpose of their research. While the measure of income on a macro level is critical to societal and policy studies, individuals are more focused on their personal and business income.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The term “income” generally refers to the amount of money, property, and other transfers of value received over a set period of time by individuals or entities as compensation for services, payment for products, returns on investments, pension distributions, gifts, and myriad other transfer of value.\n* There is no single, standard definition of income; income is defined, and its amount determined, according to the context in which the concept is used.\n* Taxable income is the result of determining the annual total or gross income of an individual or entity and reducing that amount by the exclusions, exemptions, and deductions allowed under the tax law.\n* Financial regulators, businesses, and investors focus on businesses’ annual financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and start by determining all revenue and then adjusting that amount by expenses and losses to determine a net income figure. \n\n## Income: Defined in Context\n\nIn their day-to-day lives, individuals generally focus on both their levels of disposable income (that is, their total income minus taxes) and their discretionary income (that is, the amount, if any, left after payment of taxes and expenditures for necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter).2 In dealing with their personal, business, and investment activities, individuals are concerned with income as determined under tax rules and—especially in the case of business owners and investors—financial accounting rules.\n\nAlthough tax and accounting rules have similarities, each system has special rules reflecting its distinctive context and purposes. Generally, taxation and financial accounting measure income over a 12-month period. While financial accounting income is comprehensive, taxable income is calculated with special statutory exclusions, exemptions, and allowances that vary by tax status, income source, and individual and business decisions. \n \n\n## Taxable Income\n\nFor income tax purposes, the tax code attempts to define income to reflect taxpayers’ actual economic position.  In the interest of clarity, efficiency, and ease of administration, the law provides certain fixed allowances—for example, the personal standard deduction. The general tax framework applies to taxpayers’ personal revenue (other than tax-exempt income) from all sources and offsets such revenue with deductions for expenses and losses to determine taxable income.\n\nIn addition, varied public policies underlie a wide range of tax rules that cause the calculation of taxable income to diverge from purely economic calculation. For example, such policies include helping to finance government by making government bonds tax-exempt; addressing social welfare needs through tax-free fringe benefits and tax-favored treatment for retirement savings; directing benefits to lower-income individuals by providing some tax credits that are phased out at higher income levels; and promoting energy efficiency through special tax credits.3 \n \n\nThree categories of income are of principal concern to taxpayers: ordinary income, capital gain, and tax-exempt income.\n\n### Ordinary Income\n\nThe tax law distinguishes ordinary income and loss from gain and loss on capital investments. Ordinary income encompasses earnings, interest, regular dividends, rental income, pension distributions, regular annuity and retirement account distributions, and Social Security income received by taxpayers whose total income exceeds certain thresholds. Ordinary income is taxed at rates ranging from 10% to 37% in 2022. Taxpayers whose net investment income exceeds specified thresholds pay an additional 3.8% net investment income tax.4   \n \n\n### Capital Gain\n\nGain and loss realized on the disposition of capital assets are treated as capital gain or loss. The tax rates on net capital gains realized with respect to assets held more than one year are 0%, 15%, and 20%. Capital assets include personal residences and investments such as real estate, stock, bonds, and other financial instruments.5  \n\nQualified dividends—that is, dividends distributed with respect to U.S. and certain foreign corporate stock holdings that meet statutory holding-period requirements—also are taxed at capital gains rates.6 \n \n\n### Tax-exempt Income\n\nInterest paid on certain bonds issued by governmental entities is treated as tax-exempt income. Interest paid on federal bonds and Treasury securities is exempt from state and local taxation.7\n\nInterest on bonds issued by state and local governments generally is not subject to federal taxation; municipal private activity bonds are not subject to the regular federal income tax, but they are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Some states and local governments also exempt interest on state and local bonds from taxation.8  \n\n## Business Income: GAAP Income\n\nMost businesses, including all public companies, employ standard financial accounting methods and practices—i.e., [generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp)—to determine their income and worth. Audited financial statements prepared in accordance with these rules are required for public companies’ filings with the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) and for filings with other governmental agencies and regulatory bodies. Investors assess businesses’ financial statements and use them to compare the performance of companies in the same or different industries.\n\nGAAP does not incorporate the type of public policy deviations from pure economic calculation that are embodied in the tax code. The two systems employ different timing standards for recognizing revenue and expenses. Generally, the snapshot of income and business value determined using GAAP provides a picture of business income and worth that often is closer to economic reality than the results of tax accounting.9 \n \n\n## Is there a standard definition of income?\n\nThe definition of income depends on the context in which the term is used. For example, the tax law uses the concepts of gross income, which includes all income in all its forms, and taxable income, which is gross income net of expenses and other adjustments. On the other hand, the standard for financial accounting—generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)—uses the term “revenue” to describe the comprehensive amount of all fees for products and services, and it reduces that amount by expenses to determine net income. In addition, the calculation of income will vary depending on the scope of the context—e.g., an individual, a household, an industry, a nation, etc.\n\n## What is taxable income?\n\nTaxable income is the total of all income from all sources and in any form—e.g., money and property, derived, adjusted to exclude tax-exempt amounts, and reduced by allowable deductions. It is the amount that is subject to income taxation. \n \n\n## Which categories of income are tax-exempt?\n\nFederal, state, and local tax laws specify certain categories of income that are not subject to income taxation. Generally, interest paid on state and local government bonds is exempt from federal income tax. Federal law also exempts interest paid on some special narrow categories of federal agency debt. State tax laws exempt interest on U.S. Treasury bonds; some states also exempt interest on state and local bonds. In addition, distributions from Roth 401(k) plans and Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are tax free. Charities and other tax-exempt organizations do not pay tax on their income, except for income, if any, from unrelated trades or businesses.       ", "timestamp": 1654656473, "digest": "SJAJ6JuH0LQKaGDaSNIRIDLGDf9qWxz_yAj_iD7Qtp4", "contributor": "0xa731614453FD77C62cca4BD9aF59D92710A0cbB7"}

{"id": "wFA0K6iBXzARv_uLSXDFJsDFdwGoSouum_4osOaspbE", "title": "Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)", "body": "## What Is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)?\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.\n\nCost of goods sold is also referred to as \"cost of sales.\"\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Cost of goods sold (COGS) includes all of the costs and expenses directly related to the production of goods.\n* COGS excludes indirect costs such as overhead and sales & marketing.\n* COGS is deducted from revenues (sales) in order to calculate gross profit and gross margin. Higher COGS results in lower margins.\n* The value of COGS will change depending on the accounting standards used in the calculation.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 12 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:12\n\n#### Examining Costs Of Goods Sold (COGS)\n\n## Understanding Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n\nThe COGS is an important metric on the financial statements as it is subtracted from a company’s revenues to determine its [gross profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp). The gross profit is a profitability measure that evaluates how efficient a company is in managing its labor and supplies in the production process.\n\nBecause COGS is a [cost of doing business](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/business-startup-costs.asp), it is recorded as a business expense on the income statements.1 Knowing the cost of goods sold helps analysts, investors, and managers estimate the company’s bottom line. If COGS increases, net income will decrease. While this movement is beneficial for income tax purposes, the business will have less profit for its shareholders. Businesses thus try to keep their COGS low so that net profits will be higher.\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost of acquiring or manufacturing the products that a company sells during a period, so the only costs included in the measure are those that are directly tied to the production of the products, including the cost of labor, materials, and manufacturing overhead.2 For example, the COGS for an automaker would include the material costs for the parts that go into making the car plus the labor costs used to put the car together. The cost of sending the cars to dealerships and the cost of the labor used to sell the car would be excluded.\n\nFurthermore, costs incurred on the cars that were not sold during the year will not be included when calculating COGS, whether the costs are direct or indirect. In other words, COGS includes the direct cost of producing goods or services that were purchased by customers during the year. As a rule of thumb, if you want to know if an expense falls under COGS, ask: \"Would this expense have been an expense even if no sales were generated?\" \n \n\nCOGS only applies to those costs directly related to producing goods intended for sale.1\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{COGS}=\\\\text{Beginning Inventory}+\\\\text{P}-\\\\text{Ending Inventory}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{P}=\\\\text{Purchases during the period}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​COGS=Beginning Inventory+P−Ending InventorywhereP=Purchases during the period​\n\nInventory that is sold appears in the [income statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp) under the COGS account. The beginning inventory for the year is the inventory left over from the previous year—that is, the [merchandise](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102714/what-are-differences-between-income-statements-merchandising-companies-vs-service-companies.asp) that was not sold in the previous year. Any additional productions or purchases made by a manufacturing or retail company are added to the beginning inventory. At the end of the year, the products that were not sold are subtracted from the sum of beginning inventory and additional purchases. The final number derived from the calculation is the cost of goods sold for the year.\n\nThe balance sheet has an account called the current assets account. Under this account is an item called inventory. The balance sheet only captures a company’s financial health at the end of an accounting period. This means that the inventory value recorded under current assets is the ending inventory.\n\n## Accounting Methods and COGS\n\nThe value of the cost of goods sold depends on the inventory costing method adopted by a company. There are three methods that a company can use when recording the level of inventory sold during a period: First In, First Out (FIFO), Last In, First Out (LIFO), and the Average Cost Method. The Special Identification Method is used for high-ticket or unique items.3\n\n### FIFO\n\nThe earliest goods to be purchased or manufactured are sold first. Since prices tend to go up over time, a company that uses the FIFO method will sell its least expensive products first, which translates to a lower COGS than the COGS recorded under LIFO. Hence, the [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) using the FIFO method increases over time.\n\n### LIFO\n\nThe latest goods added to the inventory are sold first. During periods of rising prices, goods with higher costs are sold first, leading to a higher COGS amount. Over time, the net income tends to decrease.\n\n### Average Cost Method\n\nThe average price of all the goods in stock, regardless of purchase date, is used to value the goods sold. Taking the average product cost over a time period has a smoothing effect that prevents COGS from being highly impacted by extreme costs of one or more acquisitions or purchases.\n\n### Special Identification Method\n\nThe special identification method uses the specific cost of each unit if merchandise (also called inventory or goods) to calculate the ending inventory and COGS for each period. In this method, a business knows precisely which item was sold and the exact cost. Further, this method is typically used in industries that sell unique items like cars, real estate, and rare and precious jewels.\n\n## Exclusions From COGS Deduction\n\nMany service companies do not have any cost of goods sold at all. COGS is not addressed in any detail in [generally accepted accounting principles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) (GAAP), but COGS is defined as only the cost of inventory items sold during a given period. Not only do service companies have no goods to sell, but purely service companies also do not have inventories. If COGS is not listed on the income statement, no deduction can be applied for those costs.1\n\nExamples of pure service companies include accounting firms, law offices, real estate appraisers, business consultants, professional dancers, etc. Even though all of these industries have business expenses and normally spend money to provide their services, they do not list COGS. Instead, they have what is called \"cost of services,\" which does not count towards a COGS deduction.\n\n## Cost of Revenue vs. COGS\n\n[Costs of revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-of-revenue.asp) exist for ongoing contract services that can include raw materials, direct labor, shipping costs, and commissions paid to sales employees. These items cannot be claimed as COGS without a physically produced product to sell, however. The IRS website even lists some examples of \"personal service businesses\" that do not calculate COGS on their income statements. These include doctors, lawyers, carpenters, and painters.4\n\nMany service-based companies have some products to sell. For example, airlines and hotels are primarily providers of services such as transport and lodging, respectively, yet they also sell gifts, food, beverages, and other items. These items are definitely considered goods, and these companies certainly have inventories of such goods. Both of these industries can list COGS on their income statements and claim them for tax purposes.\n\n## Operating Expenses vs. COGS\n\nBoth [operating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingratio.asp) expenses and cost of goods sold (COGS) are expenditures that companies incur with running their business. However, the expenses are segregated on the income statement. Unlike COGS, operating expenses (OPEX) are expenditures that are not directly tied to the production of goods or services.5\n\nTypically, SG&A ([selling, general, and administrative expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sga.asp)) are included under operating expenses as a separate line item. SG&A expenses are expenditures that are not directly tied to a product such as overhead costs. Examples of operating expenses include the following:\n\n* Rent\n* Utilities\n* Office supplies\n* Legal costs\n* Sales and marketing\n* Payroll\n* Insurance costs\n\n## Limitations of COGS\n\nCOGS can easily be manipulated by accountants or managers looking to cook the books. It can be altered by:\n\n* Allocating to inventory higher manufacturing overhead costs than those incurred\n* Overstating discounts\n* Overstating returns to suppliers\n* Altering the amount of inventory in stock at the end of an accounting period\n* Overvaluing inventory on hand\n* Failing to write-off obsolete inventory\n\nWhen inventory is artificially inflated, COGS will be under-reported which, in turn, will lead to higher than the actual gross profit margin, and hence, an inflated net income.\n\nInvestors looking through a company’s financial statements can spot unscrupulous inventory accounting by checking for inventory buildup, such as inventory rising faster than revenue or total assets reported.\n\n## How Do You Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)?\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS) is calculated by adding up the various direct costs required to generate a company’s revenues. Importantly, COGS is based only on the costs that are *directly* utilized in producing that revenue, such as the company’s inventory or labor costs that can be attributed to specific sales. By contrast, fixed costs such as managerial salaries, rent, and utilities are not included in COGS. Inventory is a particularly important component of COGS, and accounting rules permit several different approaches for how to include it in the calculation.\n\n## Are Salaries Included in COGS?\n\nCOGS does not include salaries and other general and administrative expenses. However, certain types of labor costs can be included in COGS, provided that they can be directly associated with specific sales. For example, a company that uses contractors to generate revenues might pay those contractors a commission based on the price charged to the customer. In that scenario, the commission earned by the contractors might be included in the company’s COGS, since that labor cost is directly connected to the revenues being generated.6\n\n## How Does Inventory Affect COGS?\n\nIn theory, COGS should include the cost of all inventory that was sold during the accounting period. In practice, however, companies often don’t know exactly which units of inventory were sold. Instead, they rely on accounting methods such as the [First In, First Out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fifo.asp) (FIFO) and [Last In, First Out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifo.asp) (LIFO) rules to estimate what value of inventory was actually sold in the period. If the inventory value included in COGS is relatively high, then this will place downward pressure on the company’s gross profit. For this reason, companies sometimes choose accounting methods that will produce a lower COGS figure, in an attempt to boost their reported profitability.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuOYkULbjGIODw3oZnf0hf8NMWZ91-7OBLqD6_m6NyWh997bXPaZcD6T4ky9cLc3NmiIOdfWo4DcVqDI61i942zgKdmqKa_8mpk86z61W2Lbh87NSdaBXcA1ZETL4ownWiFmESReiw5WXvGcQwF8eRy1SB1Eq6rjXLX_6HfqIFKbFz2L__vC9rDFeInvow7dEhmpijrm6REjeP3BVoU4ln36zAMWmkGoO46CeUVGTyp3w0YddJNOIkjXuEdCaFEODGKJOT7Ty-KMiXSSA4OpIChzXU20PVW76cJJ9LY-yawyq3fZ3o6fhRDyXQ9cIuq-yQMB71sSxL3a9jcU9-k0DWz1KYXtSAr_oiK_l8ObTDLcyg&sig=Cg0ArKJSzFXgt_o9ch6jEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuOYkULbjGIODw3oZnf0hf8NMWZ91-7OBLqD6_m6NyWh997bXPaZcD6T4ky9cLc3NmiIOdfWo4DcVqDI61i942zgKdmqKa_8mpk86z61W2Lbh87NSdaBXcA1ZETL4ownWiFmESReiw5WXvGcQwF8eRy1SB1Eq6rjXLX_6HfqIFKbFz2L__vC9rDFeInvow7dEhmpijrm6REjeP3BVoU4ln36zAMWmkGoO46CeUVGTyp3w0YddJNOIkjXuEdCaFEODGKJOT7Ty-KMiXSSA4OpIChzXU20PVW76cJJ9LY-yawyq3fZ3o6fhRDyXQ9cIuq-yQMB71sSxL3a9jcU9-k0DWz1KYXtSAr_oiK_l8ObTDLcyg&sig=Cg0ArKJSzFXgt_o9ch6jEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

A lender who is worried about a borrower [defaulting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on a loan often uses a CDS to offset or swap that risk. \n \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Credit default swaps are credit derivative contracts that enable investors to swap credit risk on a company, a country, or another entity with a different counterparty.\n* Lenders purchase CDSs from investors who agree to pay the lender if the borrower ever defaults on its obligation(s).\n* CDSs are traded over-the-counter and are often used to transfer credit exposure on fixed income products in order to hedge risk.\n* There are normally three parties involved in a CDS: the debt issuer, the buyer, and the seller of the CDS.\n* Contracts are customized between the counterparties involved, which makes them opaque, illiquid, and hard to track for regulators.\n\n## How Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) Work\n\nA credit default swap is a [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) contract that transfers the [credit exposure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-exposure.asp) of fixed income products. It may involve [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) or other related securities—basically loans that the issuer receives from the lender. If a company sells a bond with a $100 face value and a 10-year maturity to a buyer, the company agrees to pay back the $100 to the buyer at the end of the 10-year period as well as regular interest payments over the course of the bond's life. Because the debt issuer cannot guarantee that it will be able to repay the premium, the debt buyer assumes the risk.\n\nCDSs require at least three parties:\n\n* The first party is the institution that issues the debt. This party is also known as the borrower.\n* The debt buyer is the second party, who will also be the CDS buyer if the parties decide to engage in the contract.\n* The CDS seller is the third entity involved in the CDS. This entity is most often a large bank or insurance company that guarantees the [underlying debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-debt.asp) between the issuer and the buyer. \n \n\n[Debt securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtsecurity.asp) often have longer terms to maturity, making it harder for investors to estimate the risk of the investment. That's why these contracts are an extremely popular way to manage risk. The buyer makes payments to the seller until the contract's [maturity date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp). In return, the seller agrees that (in the event that the debt issuer defaults or experiences another credit event) the seller will pay the buyer the security's value as well as all interest payments that would have been paid between that time and the maturity date.\n\nThe [credit event](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/credit-event.asp) is a trigger that causes the buyer of protection to terminate and settle the contract. Credit events are agreed upon when the trade is entered into and are part of the contract. The majority of single-name CDSs are traded with the following credit events as triggers:\n\n* Reference entity bankruptcy\n* Failure to pay\n* Obligation acceleration\n* [Repudiation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repudiation.asp)\n* [Moratorium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moratorium.asp)\n\nCredit default swaps are traded [over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC), which means they are non-standardized and not verified by an exchange. That's because they are complex and often bespoke. There is a lot of [speculation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp) in the CDS market, where investors can trade the obligations of the CDS if they believe they can make a profit. \n \n\nSize of the Credit Derivatives Market\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nAlthough CDSs guarantee payments through maturity, they do not necessarily need to cover the entirety of the bond's life. For example, imagine an investor is two years into a 10-year security and thinks that the issuer is in credit trouble. The bond owner may choose to buy a credit default swap with a five-year term that would protect the investment until the seventh year when the bondholder believes the risks will fade.\n\nIt is even possible for investors to effectively switch sides on a CDS to which they are already a party. For example, if the seller of a CDS believes that the borrower is likely to default, that party can buy their own CDS from another institution or sell the contract to another bank in order to offset the risks. The chain of ownership of a CDS can become very long and convoluted, which makes tracking the size of this [market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp) difficult.\n\nHere's another thing to remember about CDSs. When a credit event occurs, the contract may be settled physically, which has historically been the most common method, or by cash. In a physical settlement, sellers received an actual bond at part by the buyer. Cash settlement, though, became the more preferred method when the purpose of CDSs shifted from [hedging](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/hedging-beginners-guide/) tools to [speculation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp). In this type of settlement, the seller is responsible for paying the buyer for losses. \n \n\nThe U.S. Comptroller of the Currency issues a quarterly report on credit derivatives and in a report issued in December 2021, it placed the size of the entire market at $3.9 trillion, of which CDS accounted for $3.3. trillion.1\n\n### Mitigating the Risk\n\nA credit default swap is effectively an [insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp) policy against non-payment. The buyer can shift some or all that risk onto an insurance company or other CDS seller in exchange for a fee. By doing this, the buyer receives credit protection while the seller guarantees the [creditworthiness](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp) of the debt security. This means the buyer is entitled to the [par value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) of the contract by the seller along with any unpaid interest if the issuer ever defaults.\n\nRemember, the credit risk isn't eliminated. Rather, it is shifted to the CDS seller. If the debt issuer does not default and if all goes well, the CDS buyer ends up losing money through the payments on the CDS. The buyer, on the other hand, stands to lose a much greater proportion of their investment if the issuer defaults and didn't buy a CDS. As such, the more the holder of a security thinks their issuer will default, the more desirable a CDS becomes. As such, it ends up costing more. \n \n\nA credit default swap is the most common form of [credit derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditderivative.asp) and may involve municipal bonds, emerging market bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), or corporate bonds.\n\n## Example of a CDS\n\nHere's a hypothetical example to show how credit default swaps work. Let's assume there is a CDS that earns $10,000 quarterly payments to insure a $10 million bond. The company that originally sold the CDS believes that the credit quality of the borrower has improved so the CDS payments are high. The company could sell the rights to those payments and the obligations to another buyer and potentially make a profit.\n\nAlternatively, imagine an investor who believes that Company A is likely to default on its bonds. The investor can buy a CDS from a bank that will pay out the value of that debt if Company A defaults. A CDS can be purchased even if the buyer does not own the debt itself. This is a bit like a neighbor buying a CDS on another home in her neighborhood because she knows that the owner is out of work and may default on the [mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp).\n\nIf Lender A advances a loan to Borrower B with a mid-range [credit rating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp), Lender A can increase the quality of the loan by buying a CDS from a seller with a better credit rating and financial backing than Borrower B. In this case, the risk doesn't go away, but it is reduced through the CDS. \n \n\n### Great Recession\n\nCDSs played a key role in the [credit crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-crisis.asp) that eventually led to the Great Recession. One of the primary causes of the meltdown stemmed from the risk that CDS sellers defaulted at the same time the borrower defaulted. CDS sellers like Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG all defaulted on their CDS obligations.2\n\n### European Sovereign Debt Crisis\n\nCredit default swaps were widely used during the [European sovereign debt crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-sovereign-debt-crisis.asp).3 In September 2011, investors believed that Greece's government bonds had nearly a 100% probability of default.4 Many [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) even used CDS as a way to speculate on the likelihood that the country would default.\n\n## How Does a Credit Default Swap Work?\n\nA credit default swap is a financial derivative contract that shifts the credit risk of a fixed income product to a counterparty in exchange for a premium. Essentially, credit default swaps serve as insurance on the default of a borrower. As the most popular form of credit derivatives, buyers and sellers arrange custom agreements on over-the-counter markets which are often illiquid, speculative, and difficult for regulators to trace. \n\n## What Is an Example of a Credit Default Swap?\n\nConsider that an investor buys $10,000 in bonds with a 30-year maturity. Because of its lengthy maturity, this adds a layer of uncertainty to the investor because the company may not be able to pay back the principal $10,000 or future interest payments before expiration. To ensure themself against the probability of this outcome, the investor buys a credit default swap.\n\nA credit default swap essentially ensures that the principal or any owing interest payments will be paid over a predetermined time period. Typically, the investor will buy a credit default swap from a large financial institution, who for a fee, will guarantee the underlying debt.\n\n## What Are Credit Default Swaps Used for?\n\nCredit default swaps are primarily used for two main reasons: hedging risk and speculation. To hedge risk, investors buy credit default swaps to add a layer of insurance to protect a bond, such as a mortgage-backed security, from defaulting on its payments. In turn, a third party assumes the risk in exchange for a premium. By contrast, when investors speculate on credit default swaps, they are betting on the credit quality of the reference entity.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "CpUaerdCmlnDEfQlJqiGX8crhQrhgpgF7DRldhHODfk", "title": "Hard Skills", "body": "## What Are Hard Skills?\n\nHard skills are learned abilities acquired and enhanced through practice, repetition, and education. Hard skills are essential because they increase employee [productivity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/productivity.asp) and efficiency and subsequently improve employee satisfaction.\n\nHard skills are important for your resume, as employers look for them when reviewing your application. However, hard skills alone don't translate into business success as employees also need to employ other skills, such as soft skills, that contribute to customer satisfaction.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* People acquire hard skills through education, practice, and repetition.\n* Hard skills can refer to proficiency in any complex task.\n* Soft skills versus hard skills are difficult to teach and are behavioral and related to personality.\n* Unlike soft skills, people can prove their hard skill competencies by producing a certificate, degree, apprenticeship, or work experience.\n* You can list hard skills on a professional resume.\n\n## Understanding Hard Skills\n\nIn business, hard skills most often refer to the basics of accounting and [financial modeling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialmodeling.asp). In a broad sense, hard skills may refer to proficiency in any complex task. Fluency in a second language, knowledge of Photoshop or PowerPoint, or expertise in carpentry are all hard skills that can be learned and improved upon with practice.\n\nEmployers and recruiters most often look for these hard skills in professional resumes. Any hard skill that a person cites is best backed up with a certificate, degree, or other qualification that shows a level of achievement. Experience in the subject, such as years of working with QuickBooks, are also seen as qualifications that validate expertise in hard skills.\n\n## Hard and Soft Skills Characteristics\n\nHard skills focus on practical abilities and skills, whereas soft skills focus on behaviors and personalities, such as social and communication skills. [Soft skills](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soft-skills.asp) are less tangible and harder to teach. Getting along with others, listening well, and engaging in small talk are soft skills.\n\nA person's soft skills are more intrinsic to personality and more difficult to judge quickly, but they may be as important on the job over time. They might include an ability to work on a team, flexibility, patience, and time management ability.\n\nHard skills are easier to teach than soft skills, given a certain aptitude and enthusiasm. That's why employers often look for job applicants with soft skills rather than hard skills.\n\nSoft skills like being a natural team builder or strong communication skills are sought after by hiring managers.1\n\n## Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills\n\nScientists once believed that hard skills required using the left brain, or logic center, while soft skills were associated with the right brain, also referred to as the emotional center. Recent studies by neuroscientists indicate that mental processes can't be categorized that neatly.2\n\nIt can be said that hard skills generally have rules that remain the same regardless of the business, industry, or even culture in which they are practiced. The rules of soft skills can change depending on company culture and the expectations of colleagues. For example, the rules for how a [programmer creates code](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050416/industry-handbook-software-industry.asp) are the same regardless of where the programmer works. However, a programmer may communicate effectively to other programmers about technical details but struggle when communicating with senior managers about a project's progress or support needs.\n\nHard skills may be learned in schools, from books, or through apprenticeships. The levels of competency can be defined, and there is a direct path for achieving them. For example, a person may take basic and advanced accounting courses, gain work experience, and pass the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam.\n\nSoft skills are not often found in the curriculum of a school or college. However, they are taught in programs that help people develop communication skills, teamwork, or people management skills.\n\nAsk your employer if they offer or pay for any leadership training or team-building programs for their employees. If your employer wants you to improve one of your soft or hard skills, ask HR if they will consider paying for your training classes, many companies will cover hard and soft skill programs for their employees.\n\n## Example of Hard Skills\n\nAccounting is a profession that requires a relatively rigid set of hard skills, particularly in this era. Proficiency in the Microsoft Office suite, especially Excel, is a given. Familiarity with industry-specific software, such as Great Plains, QuickBooks, Peachtree, SAP Software, and tax preparation software, is also required.\n\n[Accountants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountant.asp) need to know how to prepare and interpret financial statements and other accounting reports, develop efficient financial reporting mechanisms, and plan and implement accounting controls.\n\nSome of the other skills accountants need might be categorized as soft skills. They must be prepared to communicate effectively with regulators, deal with external auditors, and stay updated on current issues and changes in industry regulations.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nEvery job from firefighting to being a marketing executive calls for a specific skill set often made up of a combination of hard and soft skills. Whether you are considering a new job or applying for your first job, knowing what hard skills are needed for the job, and obtaining those skills, means you will have a better chance of being hired or promoted in your field of choice.\n\nSome hard skills like being proficient in using a computer, analyzing data, or understanding at least the basics of using social media are hard skills that will often be useful in many different jobs and careers. Many trades call for particular hard skills for employment in construction, architecture, plumbing and electric, and engineering.\n\nSoft and hard skills are critical for success at almost any job, and having both sets on your resume is essential when job hunting. \n \n\n## What Are Hard Skills to Include on a Resume?\n\nIf you are listing hard skills on a resume, include any technical skills you have acquired and any foreign languages. Depending on the job, you will need to list hard skills relevant to the position you are applying for.\n\n## What Hard Skills Do Employers Want?\n\nMany jobs call for hard skills in computer technology, such as being proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and be able to use data analysis tools such as Google Analytics, Accounts should be up-to-date in the newest accounting software, for example. Or if you want to work in marketing or communications, knowing how to navigate content management systems and understand other hard systems, such as SEO and design and basic coding, is essential.\n\n## How Can I Acquire Hard Skills\n\nYou can acquire hard skills by taking online or in-person classes at a university or other training program, practicing these skills before applying them to a job, and gaining experience by using the hard skills in the workplace.\n\n## Is Critical Thinking a Hard Skill?\n\nNo. Critical thinking is an important soft skill. You can study and practice critical thinking, but it cannot be \"learned\" in the same way you can teach yourself to computer code or use accounting software.", "timestamp": 1654656651, "digest": "osJvrPRcp4v4cTxAFi61QXuuaALBmDtQodOiVGoqCmg", "contributor": "0xf4633bcF878DE9986C64f8DcF96313D6A5525D08"}
{"id": "geKc8b3K16VzYxsoE9OkEvYnlTLHjyqdo_t6JGedGac", "title": "Hypothesis Testing", "body": "## What Is Hypothesis Testing?\n\nHypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst [tests](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wilcoxon-test.asp) an assumption regarding a population parameter. The methodology employed by the analyst depends on the nature of the data used and the reason for the analysis.\n\nHypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. Such data may come from a larger population, or from a data-generating process. The word \"population\" will be used for both of these cases in the following descriptions.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Hypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data.\n* The test provides evidence concerning the plausibility of the hypothesis, given the data.\n* Statistical analysts test a hypothesis by measuring and examining a random sample of the population being analyzed.\n\n## How Hypothesis Testing Works\n\nIn hypothesis testing, an [analyst](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp) tests a statistical sample, with the goal of providing evidence on the plausibility of the null hypothesis.\n\nStatistical analysts test a hypothesis by measuring and examining a random sample of the population being analyzed. All analysts use a random population sample to test two different hypotheses: the [null hypothesis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/null_hypothesis.asp) and the alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe null hypothesis is usually a hypothesis of equality between population parameters; e.g., a null hypothesis may state that the population mean return is equal to zero. The alternative hypothesis is effectively the opposite of a null hypothesis (e.g., the population mean return is not equal to zero). Thus, they are [mutually exclusive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutuallyexclusive.asp), and only one can be true. However, one of the two hypotheses will always be true.\n\n### 4 Steps of Hypothesis Testing\n\nAll hypotheses are tested using a four-step process:\n\n1. The first step is for the analyst to state the two hypotheses so that only one can be right.\n2. The next step is to formulate an analysis plan, which outlines how the data will be evaluated.\n3. The third step is to carry out the plan and physically analyze the sample data.\n4. The fourth and final step is to analyze the results and either reject the null hypothesis, or state that the null hypothesis is plausible, given the data.\n\n## Real-World Example of Hypothesis Testing\n\nIf, for example, a person wants to test that a penny has exactly a 50% chance of landing on heads, the null hypothesis would be that 50% is correct, and the alternative hypothesis would be that 50% is not correct.\n\nMathematically, the null hypothesis would be represented as Ho: P = 0.5. The alternative hypothesis would be denoted as \"Ha\" and be identical to the null hypothesis, except with the equal sign struck-through, meaning that it does not equal 50%.\n\nA random sample of 100 coin flips is taken, and the null hypothesis is then tested. If it is found that the 100 coin flips were distributed as 40 heads and 60 tails, the analyst would assume that a penny does not have a 50% chance of landing on heads and would reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\n\nIf, on the other hand, there were 48 heads and 52 tails, then it is plausible that the coin could be fair and still produce such a result. In cases such as this where the null hypothesis is \"accepted,\" the analyst states that the difference between the expected results (50 heads and 50 tails) and the observed results (48 heads and 52 tails) is \"explainable by chance alone.\"", "timestamp": 1654656747, "digest": "drJrtb5TCMXYPIhTtqCaPvPlKr3ImWUJzMO7XqdLg08", "contributor": "0x529B2991E1630FF36818eC200f394f439750be4C"}
{"id": "Hq1evH8vex4rIdsal2h_3CQ3IKymUB-TOUuytxFrguU", "title": "Homestead Exemption", "body": "## What Is the Homestead Exemption?\n\nThe homestead exemption is a legal provision that helps shield a home from some [creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp) following the death of a homeowner's spouse or the declaration of [bankruptcy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp). The homestead tax exemption can also provide surviving spouses with ongoing property tax relief, which is done on a graduated scale so that homes with lower [assessed values](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assessedvalue.asp) benefit the most.12\n\nThe homestead exemption is helpful since it is designed to provide both physical shelter and financial protection, which can block the forced sale of a [primary residence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principalresidence.asp#:\\~:text=What%20Is%20a%20Principal%20Residence,lives%20most%20of%20the%20time.). However, the homestead exemption does not prevent or stop a bank [foreclosure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp) if the homeowner defaults on their mortgage. Foreclosure occurs when a bank takes possession of a home due to failure to make timely mortgage payments.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A homestead exemption can help protect a home from creditors in the event of a spouse dying or a homeowner declaring bankruptcy.\n* The provision provides surviving qualifying spouses with ongoing property tax relief in certain states.\n* Although most states have homestead exemptions, the rules and protection limits vary.\n\n## How Homestead Exemption Works\n\nA version of the homestead exemption provision is found in every state or territory with some exceptions, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania.3 Yet how the [exemption](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exemption.asp) is applied, and how much protection it affords against creditors, varies by state. The homestead exemption is an automatic benefit in some states while, in others, homeowners must file a claim with the state in order to receive it.\n\nSince a homestead property is considered a person's primary residence, no exemptions can be claimed on other owned property, even residences. Further, if a surviving spouse moves their primary residence, they must re-file for the exemption.\n\n### \n\n*The homestead tax exemption helps to shield a portion of a home's value from property taxes. Homeowners may need to apply for the benefit and should check with their local government how to do so.*\n\n## Protection from Creditors Under Homestead Exemption\n\nThe exemptions for homestead properties vary from state to state. A few states, including Florida and Texas, afford unlimited financial protection against unsecured creditors for the home, although acreage limits may apply for the protected property.4 More common, however, is a limit for protection from creditors that ranges between $5,000 and $500,000, depending on the state, with many states in the $30,000 to $50,000 range.3\n\nHowever, the protection limits are not for the value of the home, but for the homeowner's [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) in it—the value of the property minus the balance of the mortgage and other financial claims on that property. If the equity held is less than the limit, the homeowner can't be forced to sell the property to benefit creditors. If a homestead's equity exceeds the limits, however, creditors may force the sale, although the homesteader may be allowed to keep a portion of the proceeds.5\n\nAdditionally, the protection for the homestead property does not apply for [secured creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secured-creditor.asp#:\\~:text=A%20secured%20creditor%20is%20any,products%20are%20backed%20by%20collateral.&text=In%20the%20event%20that%20a,forfeited%20to%20the%20secured%20creditor.), such as the bank that holds the [mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/05/020705.asp) on the home. Instead, the homeowner is protected only from [unsecured creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredcreditor.asp) who may come after the home's value to satisfy claims against the homeowner's assets.\n\n### Bankruptcy Protection\n\nThere's a twist when it comes to bankruptcy protection. For bankruptcy cases filed after April 1, 2019, federal bankruptcy law shields a home from sale if the owner's equity does not exceed $25,150. For cases brought before then, the exemption is $23,675.67 In most states, homeowners are forced to use the state limits, which are often more favorable anyway. However, about one in three states allow either the federal or applicable state limit to be used.\n\nAmong the upshots: Those who declare bankruptcy in New Jersey or Pennsylvania can get protection using the federal limits despite the absence of a state homestead exemption in those states.8 Note, however, that the bankruptcy protection similarly only protects against unsecured creditors; it will not prevent a bank that holds a mortgage from foreclosing on the home.\n\n## Deducting the Homestead Exemption\n\nA homestead tax or property tax is typically applied to homes based on the assessed value of the property by the local government tax assessor's office. The homestead tax can be a percentage of the property's value or a fixed amount.\n\nThe homestead tax exemption may offer ongoing reductions in property taxes depending on local state laws. These exemptions can help surviving spouses remain in their homes after their income has been reduced by the death of their partner.\n\nHomestead tax exemptions usually offer a fixed discount on taxes, such as exempting the first $50,000 of the assessed value, with the remainder taxed at the normal rate. For example, using a $50,000 homestead exemption, a home valued at $150,000 would be taxed on only $100,000 of assessed value, and a home valued at $75,000 would then be taxed on only $25,000.\n\nFixed homestead tax exemptions essentially turn a property tax into a [progressive tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp) that is more favorable to those with more modest homes. In some areas, the exemption is paid for with a local or state (or equivalent unit) sales tax.9\n\nTo qualify for homestead exemption, homeowners must occupy the property as their permanent residence. Homestead exemption cannot be claimed for any other property that may be located elsewhere.\n\n### Example of a Homestead Exemption\n\nLet’s say the assessed value of your home is $300,000 and your property tax rate is 1%. Your property tax bill would equal $3,000. But if you were eligible for a homestead tax exemption of $50,000, the taxable value of your home would drop to $250,000, meaning your tax bill would drop to $2,500.\n\n## Homestead Exemption FAQs\n\n### How Do I Apply for a Homestead Exemption?\n\nFor details on homestead tax exemptions, go directly to your county or local tax assessor website. Some states require you to fill out an application. Make sure you comply with your state's application deadlines.\n\nAlso, be aware that some sites may be fraudulent and may request payment to fill out an application. Your county or local tax assessor will not require you to pay a fee to fill out an application for homestead tax exemption.\n\n### Who Is Eligible for a Homestead Exemption?\n\nEligibility for the homestead exemption varies by state. Typically, you will be eligible if your income is low, you are a senior, you have a disability, or you are a veteran. Exemptions can be combined if you fall into more than one category. There may also be a limit on the value of a home that can qualify for an exemption. Check with your local tax assessor.\n\n### What States Have Homestead Exemptions?\n\nMost states have homestead exemptions. New Jersey and Pennsylvania do not have homestead exemptions while Massachusetts and Rhode Island have set their exemption limit at $500,000. Some states have general homestead laws instead—for example, laws that protect surviving spouses from creditors.\n\n### How Do You Qualify for a Homestead Exemption in Florida?\n\nTo qualify for the homestead exemption in Florida, individuals must occupy the property as their permanent residence prior to January 1 of the year for which they are applying. An applicant must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent U.S. resident and a Florida resident. Applicants cannot be claiming or receiving any type of tax exemption on any other property in the United States. An exemption application must be completed and submitted to the property appraiser in the county where the property is located by the statutory deadline of March 1.10\n\n### How Much Is a Florida Homestead Exemption?\n\nThe homestead exemption in Florida provides a tax exemption up to $50,000. The first $25,000 applies to all property taxes, including school district taxes. An additional exemption up to $25,000 applies to the assessed value between $50,000 and $75,000, but only to non-school taxes.10\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe homestead exemption provides an exemption from property taxes on a home. The exemption also protects the value of residents' homes from property taxes, creditors, and circumstances that arise from the death of the homeowner's spouse. Homestead exemption ensures that a surviving spouse has shelter. The exemption only applies to a primary residence and cannot be claimed for another property elsewhere. In some states, homestead protection is automatic; however, in others, homeowners must file a claim for homestead exemption with the state.", "timestamp": 1654656894, "digest": "c5oRLFdgnh-SCN-KX939PTYReFpRhYwB6WR99TuHDYM", "contributor": "0xfEeD9eF0A55184Edf149DdAaC731D49fADaE8396"}
{"id": "JMxjyE_fCUw2-xUOAfp8sUgNGdYZ940z_jtSc2_jnJM", "title": "Creative Destruction", "body": "## What Is Creative Destruction?\n\nCreative destruction is the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for innovation and is seen as a driving force of [capitalism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Creative destruction describes the deliberate dismantling of established processes in order to make way for improved methods of production.\n* Creative destruction is most often used to describe disruptive technologies such as the railroads or, in our own time, the internet.\n* The term was coined in the early 1940s by economist Joseph Schumpeter, who observed real-life examples of creative destruction, such as Henry Ford’s assembly line. \n\n## Understanding Creative Destruction\n\nThe term creative destruction was first coined by Austrian economist [Joseph Schumpeter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/joseph-schumpeter.asp) in 1942. Schumpeter characterized creative destruction as innovations in the manufacturing process that increase [productivity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/productivity.asp), describing it as the \"process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.\"\n\nInvestopedia / Alison Czinkota\n\nBasically, the theory of creative destruction assumes that long-standing arrangements and assumptions must be destroyed to free up resources and energy to be deployed for innovation. To Schumpeter, economic development is the natural result of forces internal to the market and is created by the opportunity to seek [profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp).\n\nCreative destruction theory treats [economics](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/five-economic-concepts-need-to-know.asp) as an organic and dynamic process. This stands in stark contrast with the static mathematical models of traditional Cambridge-tradition economics. [Equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp) is no longer the end goal of market processes. Instead, many fluctuating dynamics are constantly reshaped or replaced by innovation and competition.\n\nAs is implied by the word destruction, the process inevitably results in losers and winners. Producers and workers committed to the older technology will be left stranded. [Entrepreneurs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp) and workers in new technologies, meanwhile, will inevitably create [disequilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disequilibrium.asp) and highlight new profit opportunities.\n\nNetflix is a modern example of creative destruction, having overthrown disc rental and traditional media industries.\n\nIn describing creative destruction, Schumpeter was not necessarily endorsing it. In fact, his work is considered to be heavily influenced by *The Communist Manifesto*, the pamphlet by [Karl Marx](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/karl-marx.asp) and Friedrich Engels which decried the bourgeoisie for its \"constant revolutionizing of production \\[and\\] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions.\"1﻿﻿﻿\n\n## Creative Destruction Examples\n\nExamples of creative destruction in history include Henry Ford's [assembly line](https://www.investopedia.com/assembly-line-definition-4684004) and how it revolutionized the automobile manufacturing industry. However, it also displaced older markets and forced many laborers out of work.\n\nThe internet is perhaps the most all-encompassing example of creative destruction, where the losers were not only retail clerks and their employers but also bank tellers, secretaries, and travel agents. The mobile internet added many more losers, from taxi cab drivers to mapmakers.\n\nThe winners, beyond the obvious example of programmers, might be just as numerous. The entertainment industry was turned upside down by the internet, but its need for creative talent and product remains the same or greater. The internet destroyed many small businesses but created many new ones online.\n\nThe point, as Schumpeter noted, is that an evolutionary process rewards improvements and innovations and punishes less efficient ways of organizing resources. The [trend line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendline.asp) is toward progress, growth, and higher [standards of living](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp) overall.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsu7a6vOKbvoHsipNdc9xPYr2gBnxlkXcG6hp_tM6mJeTa7pn1FQoBenMUkKuuAdp3PumkVDPQCwi5EGehC7j1_SCMW57HtJiCL5XIUr2THU7F8j77uaDuomenVX2R9hcCIG8oyTYda99whmmWN4hnPydFJbNpNgar-REBEmep02y-iYpOIqNzWWJxm71uRYRyMWFd2gzxiIqypqQzgqQP9FXXUgsxV2GyhzRcpGg-XAqrJYcFEx0zp_O3UdlBP6uTVWXCNQRfUR_c_RYRp67mcxrTgog6ZXy3TRs1NO4GQq35X6-pFtzGvArqBWLYhfPKSMS-f98KA4fMdW&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAtKr-iA4PKsEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsu7a6vOKbvoHsipNdc9xPYr2gBnxlkXcG6hp_tM6mJeTa7pn1FQoBenMUkKuuAdp3PumkVDPQCwi5EGehC7j1_SCMW57HtJiCL5XIUr2THU7F8j77uaDuomenVX2R9hcCIG8oyTYda99whmmWN4hnPydFJbNpNgar-REBEmep02y-iYpOIqNzWWJxm71uRYRyMWFd2gzxiIqypqQzgqQP9FXXUgsxV2GyhzRcpGg-XAqrJYcFEx0zp_O3UdlBP6uTVWXCNQRfUR_c_RYRp67mcxrTgog6ZXy3TRs1NO4GQq35X6-pFtzGvArqBWLYhfPKSMS-f98KA4fMdW&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAtKr-iA4PKsEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

It is a key aspect of [servant-leadership](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/servant-leadership.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Customer service is the interaction between the buyer of a product and the company that sells it.\n* Good customer service is critical to business success, ensuring brand loyalty one customer at a time.\n* Recent innovations have focused on automating customer service systems but the human element is, in some cases, indispensable.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 13 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:13\n\n#### Customer Service\n\n## Understanding Customer Service\n\nBehind the scenes at most companies are people who never meet or greet the people who buy their products. The [customer service representatives](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/110315/considering-career-client-service-associate.asp) are the ones who have direct contact with the buyers. The buyers' perceptions of the company and the product are shaped in part by their experience in dealing with that person.\n\nFor this reason, many companies work hard to increase their customer satisfaction levels.\n\n### The Cost of Customer Satisfaction\n\nFor decades, businesses in many industries have sought to reduce personnel costs by automating their processes to the greatest extent possible.\n\nIn [customer service](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/07/multi-service.asp), that has led many companies to implement systems online and by phone that answer as many questions or resolve as many problems as they can without a human presence.\n\nBut in the end, there are customer service issues for which human interaction is indispensable, creating a [competitive advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp).\n\nAmazon is an example of a company that is doing all it can to automate a vast and complex operation. It has to, given that it delivered 4.2 billion packages to customers' doors in 2020.1\n\nNevertheless, Amazon still offers 24-hour customer service by phone, in addition to email and live chat services.\n\nMost successful businesses recognize the importance of providing outstanding customer service. Courteous and empathetic interaction with a trained customer service representative can mean the difference between losing or retaining a customer.\n\nCustomer service should be a one-stop process for the consumer whenever possible.\n\n### Key Components of Good Customer Service\n\n[Successful small business owners](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/make-money-in-business.asp) understand the need for good customer service instinctively. Larger businesses study the subject in-depth, and they have some basic conclusions about the key components:\n\n* Timely attention to issues raised by customers is critical. Requiring a customer to wait in line or sit on hold sours an interaction before it begins.\n* Customer service should be a single-step process for the consumer. If a customer calls a helpline, the representative should whenever possible follow the problem through to its resolution.\n* If a customer must be transferred to another department, the original representative should follow up with the customer to ensure that the problem was solved.\n\n### $35,830\n\n*The average annual salary for a customer service representative in 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.2*\n\n## Customer Services Job Requirements\n\nMuch is expected of customer service representatives.

The average salary in 2020 was about $35,830, according to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/092204.asp).2\n\nSome of the job expectations:\n\n* Customer service representatives must be accessible, knowledgeable, and courteous. They require excellent listening skills and a willingness to talk through a resolution. Training in conflict resolution can be beneficial.\n* Strong speaking skills are important. For phone staff, this means speaking clearly and slowly while maintaining a calm demeanor even if the customer doesn't.\n\n### \n\n*The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected customer service representative job growth to show little or no change from 2020 to 2030.2*\n\n## Customer Services Employer Responsibilities\n\nPoor management can doom any customer service operation. A couple of important tips for managers:\n\n* Make sure your customer service representatives are fully informed and have the latest information and the company's products and policies.\n* Periodically assess the customer service experience you are providing to ensure that it's an asset to the company.\n* Consider conducting regular surveys to give customers the chance to provide feedback about the service they receive and suggest areas for improvement.\n\n## Using Mobile Services Effectively\n\nIn recent years, studies of customer service have centered on creating the perfect [online experience](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/11/benefits-and-drawbacks-of-internet-banks.asp).3\n\nThe first and most difficult factor is the multiplicity of channels. Today's customers expect to get service through whatever app or device they happen to be using at the moment. That may be a mobile device or a laptop, a social media site, text app, or live chat.\n\nOnce again, the focus has been on packaging how-to content and related resources that are designed for self-service.

That money can be put back into the business to good effect.\n* Generally speaking, a DSO under 45 days is considered low.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 44 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:44\n\n#### Day Sales Outstanding\n\n## Understanding Days Sales Outstanding\n\nGiven the vital importance of cash flow in running a business, it is in a company's best interest to collect its outstanding [account receivables](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp) as quickly as possible. Companies can expect with relative certainty that they will, in fact, be paid their outstanding receivables. But, because of the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) principle, time spent waiting to be paid is money lost. \n \n\nThat said, the definition of \"quickly\" depends on the business. In the financial industry, relatively long payment terms are common. In the agriculture and fuel industries, fast payment can be crucial. In general, small businesses rely more heavily on steady cash flow than large, diversified companies.1\n\n\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{DSO} = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Accounts Receivable} }{ \\\\text{Total Credit Sales} } \\\\times \\\\text{Number of Days}\\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned}​DSO=Total Credit SalesAccounts Receivable​×Number of Days​ \n \n\nBy quickly turning sales into cash, a company has a chance to put the cash to use again more quickly.\n\n## What the Numbers Tell You\n\nA high DSO number shows that a company is selling its product to customers on credit and waiting a long time to collect the money. This can lead to cash flow problems. A low DSO value means that it takes a company fewer days to collect its accounts receivable. That company is promptly getting the money it needs to create new business.\n\nIn effect, determining the average length of time that a company’s outstanding balances are carried in receivables can reveal a great deal about the nature of the company’s cash flow.\n\nIt is important to remember that the formula for calculating DSO only accounts for credit sales. While cash sales may be considered to have a DSO of 0, they are not factored into DSO calculations. If they were factored into the calculation, they would decrease the DSO, and companies with a high proportion of cash sales would have lower DSOs than those with a high proportion of credit sales.\n\n## Applications of Days Sales Outstanding\n\nDays sales outstanding can be analyzed in a wide variety of ways. It suggests how efficient the company's collections department is, and the degree to which the company is maintaining customer satisfaction. It also helps identify customers who are not creditworthy.\n\nLooking at a DSO value for a company for a single period can provide a good benchmark for quickly assessing a company’s cash flow. However, trends in DSO over time are much more useful. They can act as an early warning sign of trouble.\n\n## Good and Bad DSO Numbers\n\nIf a company’s DSO is increasing, it's a warning sign that something is wrong. Customer satisfaction might be declining, or the salespeople may be offering longer terms of payment to drive increased sales. Or the company may be allowing customers with poor credit to make purchases on credit.\n\nA sharp increase in DSO can cause a company serious cash flow problems. If a company's ability to make its own payments in a timely fashion is disrupted, it may be forced to make drastic changes.\n\nGenerally, when looking at a given company’s cash flow, it is helpful to track that company’s DSO over time to determine if its DSO is trending up or down or if there are patterns in the company’s cash flow history.\n\nDSO may vary consistently on a monthly basis, particularly if the company's product is seasonal. If a company has a volatile DSO, this may be cause for concern, but if its DSO regularly dips during a particular season each year, it could be no reason to worry.\n\n## Limitations of Days Sales Outstanding\n\nAs a metric attempting to gauge the efficiency of a business, days sales outstanding comes with a limitation that is important for any investor to consider.\n\nWhen using DSO to compare the cash flows of a number of companies, you should compare companies within the same industry, with similar [business models](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp) and revenue numbers. If you try to compare companies in different industries and of different sizes, the results you'll get will be misleading because they often have very different DSO benchmarks and targets.\n\n### When DSO Is Not As Relevant\n\nDSO is not particularly useful in comparing companies with significant differences in the proportion of sales that are made on credit. The DSO of a company with a low proportion of credit sales does not indicate much about that company’s cash flow. Comparing such companies with those that have a high proportion of credit sales also says little.\n\nIn addition, DSO is not a perfect indicator of a company’s accounts receivable efficiency. Fluctuating sales volumes can affect DSO, with any increase in sales lowering the DSO value.\n\nDelinquent Days Sales Outstanding (DDSO) is a good alternative for credit collection assessment or for use alongside DSO. Like any metric measuring a company’s performance, DSO should not be considered alone, but rather should be used with other metrics.\n\nHere are the answers to the most commonly asked questions about days sales outstanding.\n\n## How Do You Calculate DSO?\n\nDivide the total number of accounts receivable during a given period by the total dollar value of credit sales during the same period, then multiply the result by the number of days in the period being measured.\n\n## What Is a Good DSO Ratio?\n\nA good or bad DSO ratio may vary according to the type of business and industry that the company operates in. That said, a number under 45 is considered to be good for most businesses. It suggests that the company's cash is flowing in at a reasonably efficient rate, ready to be used to generate new business.\n\n## How Do You Calculate DSO for 3 Months?\n\nDuring the last three months of the year, Company A made a total of $1,500,000 in credit sales and had $1,050,000 in accounts receivable. The time period covers 92 days. Company A’s DSO for that period is calculated as follows:\n\n* 1,050,000 divided by 1,500,000 equals 0.7.\n* 0.7 multiplied by 92 equals 64.4.\n\nThe DSO for this business in this period is 64.4.\n\n## Why Is DSO Important?\n\nA high DSO number can indicate that the cash flow of the business is not ideal. It varies by business, but a number below 45 is considered good. It's best to track the number over time. If the number is climbing, there may be something wrong in the collections department, or the company may be selling to customers with less than optimal credit. In any case, the company's cash flow is at risk.\n\nThe debt collections experts at Atradius suggest that tracking DSO over time also creates an incentive for the payments department to stay on top of unpaid invoices.11 Needless to say, a small business can use its days sales outstanding number to identify and flag customers that are weighing it down by not paying promptly.2\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nIn many businesses, the days sales outstanding number can be a valuable indicator of the efficiency of the business and the quality of its cash flow. If the number gets too high, it could even disrupt the normal operations of the business, causing its own outstanding payments to be delayed. In any case, cash delayed is cash lost to your business.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssqXKuqXzBOEtHJMNeHwJVfs7Rvm5eNjNTGYz2yUJIMjDjeQvlXt9in3wyUqrenbAU3obygyfMnkIdO0vHPpzjH7ziHwA04fahTpJz3oQyguYzKLyH5W0vSLajECbfN5jSa_nBfD5TkJ7OlENicHr1nqV4qIIlHj0zhcwWZ78PFGmQWJRFJmgrxmND3eeBUnWUbR9PY-XLArWp8dr6_nITUKtxyHTuysKS9qhtUDKhD-vG_UuHvsLnJ8NVozITzDlS5kEk1e5YW74Yg8xle5sm0dZxYBVtLD874CAlxt_0im4tys8Bsr0jceOkyL1Ri0sIM65XmMlDKtZA2FwqrZRLr0imYwuwpLwDiXX7SomxyPFE&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMzyst7-NOYhEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssqXKuqXzBOEtHJMNeHwJVfs7Rvm5eNjNTGYz2yUJIMjDjeQvlXt9in3wyUqrenbAU3obygyfMnkIdO0vHPpzjH7ziHwA04fahTpJz3oQyguYzKLyH5W0vSLajECbfN5jSa_nBfD5TkJ7OlENicHr1nqV4qIIlHj0zhcwWZ78PFGmQWJRFJmgrxmND3eeBUnWUbR9PY-XLArWp8dr6_nITUKtxyHTuysKS9qhtUDKhD-vG_UuHvsLnJ8NVozITzDlS5kEk1e5YW74Yg8xle5sm0dZxYBVtLD874CAlxt_0im4tys8Bsr0jceOkyL1Ri0sIM65XmMlDKtZA2FwqrZRLr0imYwuwpLwDiXX7SomxyPFE&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMzyst7-NOYhEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "JMNpwFCaM1NsObWUYgxYGzbsSUiwcktFnM6err5mOiM", "title": "Guarantor", "body": "## What Is a Guarantor?\n\nA guarantor is a financial term describing an individual who promises to pay a borrower's debt in the event that the borrower defaults on their loan obligation. Guarantors [pledge their own assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pledgedasset.asp) as collateral against the loans. On rare occasions, individuals act as their own guarantors, by pledging their own assets against the loan. The term \"guarantor\" is often interchanged with the term \"surety.\"\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A guarantor guarantees to pay a borrower's debt in the event that the borrower defaults on a loan obligation.\n* The guarantor guarantees a loan by pledging their assets as collateral.\n* A guarantor alternatively describes someone who verifies the identity of an individual attempting to land a job or secure a passport.\n* Unlike a co-signer, a guarantor has no claim to the asset purchased by the borrower.\n* If the borrower defaults on their loan, then the guarantor is liable for the outstanding obligation, which they must meet, otherwise, legal action may be brought against them.\n\n## Understanding a Guarantor\n\nA guarantor is typically over the age of 18 and [resides in the country](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principalresidence.asp) where the payment agreement occurs. Guarantors generally exhibit exemplary credit histories and sufficient income to cover the loan payments if and when the borrower [defaults](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp), at which time the guarantor's assets may be seized by the lender. And if the borrower chronically makes payments late, the guarantor may be on the hook for additional interest owed or penalty costs.\n\n## Types of Guarantors\n\nThere are many different scenarios in which a guarantor would need to be used. This ranges from assisting people with poor credit histories to simply assisting those without a high enough income. Guarantors also don't necessarily need to be liable for the entire monetary obligation in the guarantee. Below are different situations that would require a guarantor as well as the type of guarantor in a specific guarantee.\n\n### Guarantors as Certifiers\n\nIn addition to pledging their assets as [collateral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp) against loans, guarantors may also help individuals land jobs and secure passport documents. In these situations, guarantors certify that they personally know the applicants and corroborate their identities by confirming photo IDs.\n\n### Limited vs. Unlimited\n\nAs defined under the terms of the loan agreement, a guarantor can either be limited or unlimited, with respect to timetables and levels of financial involvement. Case in point: a limited guarantor may be asked to guarantee a loan only up to a certain time, after which the borrower alone assumes responsibility for the remaining payments and alone suffers the consequences of defaulting.\n\nA limited guarantor may also only be responsible for backing a certain percentage of the loan, referred to as a penal sum. This differs from unlimited guarantors, who are liable for the entire amount of the loan throughout the entire duration of the contract.\n\n### Other Contexts for Guarantors\n\nGuarantors aren't solely used by borrowers with poor [credit histories](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp). Pointedly: landlords frequently require first-time property renters to provide lease guarantors. This commonly occurs with college students whose parents assume the role of the guarantor, in case the tenant is unable to make the rent or prematurely breaks the lease agreement.\n\n## Guarantors vs. Co-signers\n\nA guarantor differs from a [co-signer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/co_sign.asp), who co-owns the asset, and whose name appears on titles. Co-signer arrangements typically occur when the borrower’s qualifying income is less than the figure stipulated in the lender's requirement. This differs from guarantors, who step in only when borrowers have sufficient income but are thwarted by lousy credit histories. Co-signers share ownership of an asset, while guarantors have no claim to the asset purchased by the borrower.\n\nHowever, in the event the borrower has a claim against a third party that has caused the default, the guarantor has the right to invoke a process called \"[subrogation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subrogation.asp)\" (\"step into the shoes of the borrower\") in order to recover damages.\n\nFor example, in a rental agreement, a co-signer would be responsible for the rent from day one, whereas a guarantor would only be responsible for the rent if the renter fails to make a payment. This also applies to any loan. Guarantors are only notified when the borrower defaults, not for any payment before that.\n\nIn the event of a default, the guarantor’s credit history may be adversely affected, which may limit their own chances of securing loans in the future.\n\nIn essence, a co-signer takes on more financial responsibility than a guarantor does as a co-signer is equally responsible from the onset of the agreement, whereas a guarantor is only responsible once the primary party to the contract fails to meet their obligation.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Guarantors\n\nIn an agreement with a guarantor, the advantages usually lie with the primary party in the contract, whereas the disadvantages usually lie with the guarantor. Having a guarantor means that the loan or agreement has a higher chance of being approved and much more quickly. Most likely, it can allow for borrowing more and receiving a better interest rate. Though loans with guarantors tend to have higher interest rates.\n\nIn a rental agreement, one way to avoid needing a guarantor is by paying a few months of rent upfront if you are in a position to do so.\n\nThe disadvantages lie with the guarantor. If the person you are guaranteeing fails to pay their obligations, then you are on the hook for the amount. If you are not in the financial situation to make the payments, then you are still liable for the amount and your [credit score](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) will be negatively impacted and legal action may be taken against you. Also, if you guarantee a loan then your ability to borrow additional money for something else is limited because you are tied to an existing obligation.\n\nPros\n\n* Helps a borrower obtain a loan or a rental much easier.\n* Allows for the ability to borrow a higher amount.\n* Can help the borrower improve their credit history.\n\nCons\n\n* The guarantor may be liable for the outstanding obligation.\n* The guarantor's credit score could be negatively impacted.\n* The ability to obtain another loan for a separate use is limited.\n\n## Is a Guarantor a Co-signer?\n\nThough the terms are used interchangeably, they are both different. A co-signer takes on equal responsibility in an agreement, co-owns the asset, and is responsible for payments from the start of the agreement. A guarantor is only responsible for payments once the primary party of the agreement defaults and is then notified by the lender. A co-signer has more financial responsibility than a guarantor.\n\n## Is a Parent a Guarantor?\n\nA parent can act as a guarantor and often does for a child for their child's first rental property, as the child's income is usually not high enough at a young age.\n\n## How Do You Qualify as a Guarantor?\n\nDifferent agreements and different lenders have different requirements for a guarantor. At the minimum, a guarantor will need to have a high credit score without any issues in their [credit report](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp). They will also have to have an income that is a certain multiple of the monthly or annual payments.\n\n## How Much Do You Need to Earn to Be a Guarantor?\n\nThere is no specific amount that an individual needs to earn to be a guarantor. The amount relates directly to the loan in question or the rent on a property. For rental agreements, [landlords](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/landlord.asp) usually expect the guarantor to have an annual income that is at least 40 times the monthly rent.\n\n## What Happens If a Guarantor Cannot Pay?\n\nIf a guarantor cannot pay, both they and the tenant are liable for the obligations. The lender will begin collection proceedings against both the guarantor and the tenant, which will adversely impact the credit profile of both.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nA guarantor is an individual that agrees to pay a borrower's debt in the event that the borrower defaults on their obligation. A guarantor is not a primary party to the agreement but is considered as additional comfort for a lender. A guarantor will have a strong credit score and earn a sufficient income to meet the obligation.\n\nHaving a guarantor on a loan agreement greatly benefits the borrower. It allows for an agreement to be approved much faster and often at a higher amount.\n\nIn the event a borrower defaults, the guarantor must meet the obligation. If they do not, they are still liable and can have a lawsuit brought against them for the outstanding amount. They will also see a negative hit on their credit score.", "timestamp": 1654657130, "digest": "4h48PSN2Py7typwmictzttGVwX2pX1qdK_PWySUbCqU", "contributor": "0xA42726cEebb2a86481E84CFD8F7cd4c5C90c88F6"}
{"id": "qmwU5EWNrcBut6l2XuKX5neGUJIMtqEDzX-R5o8pVbo", "title": "Debenture", "body": "## What Is a Debenture?\n\nA debenture is a type of bond or other debt instrument that is unsecured by [collateral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp). Since debentures have no collateral backing, they must rely on the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer for support. Both corporations and governments frequently issue debentures to raise capital or funds.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A debenture is a type of debt instrument that is not backed by any collateral and usually has a term greater than 10 years.\n* Debentures are backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer.\n* Both corporations and governments frequently issue debentures to raise capital or funds.\n* Some debentures can convert to equity shares while others cannot.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 24 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:23\n\n#### Debentures\n\n## Understanding Debentures\n\nSimilar to most bonds, debentures may pay periodic interest payments called coupon payments. Like other types of bonds, debentures are documented in an [indenture](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indenture.asp). An indenture is a legal and binding contract between bond issuers and [bondholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp). The contract specifies features of a debt offering, such as the [maturity date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), the timing of interest or coupon payments, the method of interest calculation, and other features. Corporations and governments can issue debentures.\n\nGovernments typically issue long-term bonds—those with maturities of longer than 10 years. Considered low-risk investments, these government bonds have the backing of the government issuer.\n\nCorporations also use debentures as long-term loans. However, the debentures of corporations are unsecured.1 Instead, they have the backing of only the financial viability and creditworthiness of the underlying company. These debt instruments pay an interest rate and are redeemable or repayable on a fixed date. A company typically makes these scheduled debt interest payments before they pay stock dividends to shareholders. Debentures are advantageous for companies since they carry lower interest rates and longer repayment dates as compared to other types of loans and debt instruments.\n\n## Convertible vs. Nonconvertible\n\n[Convertible debentures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertibledebenture.asp) are bonds that can convert into equity shares of the issuing corporation after a specific period. Convertible debentures are hybrid financial products with the benefits of both debt and equity. Companies use debentures as fixed-rate loans and pay fixed interest payments. However, the holders of the debenture have the option of holding the loan until maturity and receive the interest payments or convert the loan into equity shares.\n\nConvertible debentures are attractive to investors that want to convert to equity if they believe the company's stock will rise in the long term. However, the ability to convert to equity comes at a price since convertible debentures pay a lower interest rate compared to other fixed-rate investments.\n\nNonconvertible debentures are traditional debentures that cannot be converted into equity of the issuing corporation. To compensate for the lack of convertibility investors are rewarded with a higher interest rate when compared to convertible debentures.\n\n## Features of a Debenture\n\nWhen issuing a debenture, first a trust indenture must be drafted. The first trust is an agreement between the issuing corporation and the trustee that manages the interest of the investors.\n\n### Interest Rate\n\nThe coupon rate is determined, which is the rate of interest that the company will pay the debenture holder or investor. This coupon rate can be either fixed or floating. A floating rate might be tied to a benchmark such as the yield of the 10-year Treasury bond and will change as the benchmark changes.\n\n### Credit Rating\n\nThe company's [credit rating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) and ultimately the debenture's credit rating impacts the interest rate that investors will receive. Credit-rating agencies measure the creditworthiness of corporate and government issues.2 These entities provide investors with an overview of the risks involved in investing in debt.\n\nCredit rating agencies, such as Standard and Poor's, typically assign letter grades indicating the underlying creditworthiness. The Standard & Poor’s system uses a scale that ranges from AAA for excellent rating to the lowest rating of C and D. Any debt instrument receiving a rating of lower than a BB is said to be of speculative grade.3 You may also hear these called junk bonds. It boils down to the underlying issuer being more likely to default on the debt.\n\n### Maturity Date\n\nFor nonconvertible debentures, mentioned above, the date of maturity is also an important feature. This date dictates when the company must pay back the debenture holders. The company has options on the form the repayment will take. Most often, it is as redemption from the capital, where the issuer pays a lump sum amount on the maturity of the debt. Alternatively, the payment may use a redemption reserve, where the company pays specific amounts each year until full repayment at the date of maturity.\n\n## Pros and Cons of Debentures\n\nPros\n\n* A debenture pays a regular interest rate or coupon rate return to investors.\n* Convertible debentures can be converted to equity shares after a specified period, making them more appealing to investors.\n* In the event of a corporation's bankruptcy, the debenture is paid before common stock shareholders.\n\nCons\n\n* Fixed-rate debentures may have interest rate risk exposure in environments where the market interest rate is rising.\n* Creditworthiness is important when considering the chance of default risk from the underlying issuer's financial viability.\n* Debentures may have inflationary risk if the coupon paid does not keep up with the rate of inflation.\n\n## Debenture Risks to Investors\n\nDebenture holders may face [inflationary risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflationrisk.asp).4 Here, the risk is that the debt's interest rate paid may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Inflation measures economy-based price increases. As an example, say inflation causes prices to increase by 3%, should the debenture coupon pay at 2%, the holders may see a net loss, in real terms.\n\nDebentures also carry [interest rate risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp).4 In this risk scenario, investors hold fixed-rate debts during times of rising market interest rates. These investors may find their debt returning less than what is available from other investments paying the current, higher, market rate. If this happens, the debenture holder earns a lower yield in comparison.\n\nFurther, debentures may carry credit risk and [default risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp).5 As stated earlier, debentures are only as secure as the underlying issuer's financial strength. If the company struggles financially due to internal or macroeconomic factors, investors are at risk of default on the debenture. As some consolation, a debenture holder would be repaid before common stock shareholders in the event of bankruptcy.\n\nThe three main features of a debenture are the interest rate, the credit rating and the maturity date.\n\n## Example of a Debenture\n\nAn example of a government debenture would be the U.S. [Treasury bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp) (T-bond). T-bonds help finance projects and fund day-to-day governmental operations. The U.S. Treasury Department issues these bonds during auctions held throughout the year. Some Treasury bonds trade in the secondary market. In the secondary market through a financial institution or broker, investors can buy and sell previously issued bonds. T-bonds are nearly risk-free since they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. However, they also face the risk of inflation and interest rates increase.6\n\n## Is a Debenture Different From a Bond?\n\nA debenture is a type of bond. In particular, it is an unsecured or non-collateralized debt issued by a firm or other entity and usually refers to such bonds with longer maturities.\n\n## Are Debentures Risky Investments?\n\nBecause debentures are debt securities, they tend to be less risky than investing in the same company's common stock or preferred shares. Debenture holders would also be considered more senior and take priority over those other types of investments in the case of bankruptcy.\n\n \n \n\nBecause these debts are not backed by any collateral, however, they are inherently riskier than secured debts. Therefore, these may carry relatively higher interest rates than otherwise similar bonds from the same issuer that are backed by collateral.\n\nIn fact, strictly speaking, a U.S. Treasury bond and a U.S. Treasury bill are both debentures. They are not secured by collateral, yet they are considered risk-free securities.\n\n## How Are Debentures Structured?\n\nAll debentures follow a standard structuring process and have common features. First, a trust indenture is drafted, which is an agreement between the issuing entity and the entity that manages the interests of the bondholders. Next, the coupon rate is decided, which is the rate of interest that the company will pay the debenture holder or investor. This rate can be either fixed or floating and depends on the company's credit rating or the bond's credit rating. Debentures may also be either convertible or non-convertible into common stock.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

In some respects, game theory is the science of strategy, or at least the optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting. \n \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Game theory is a theoretical framework to conceive social situations among competing players and produce optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting. \n* Using game theory, real-world scenarios for such situations as pricing competition and product releases (and many more) can be laid out and their outcomes predicted. \n* Scenarios include the prisoner's dilemma and the dictator game among many others.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 18 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:18\n\n#### Game Theory\n\n## How Game Theory Works\n\nThe key pioneers of game theory were mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s.1 Mathematician John Nash is regarded by many as providing the first significant extension of the von Neumann and Morgenstern work.\n\nThe focus of game theory is the game, which serves as a model of an interactive situation among rational players. The key to game theory is that one player's payoff is contingent on the strategy implemented by the other player. \n\nThe game identifies the players' identities, preferences, and available strategies and how these strategies affect the outcome. Depending on the model, various other requirements or assumptions may be necessary.\n\nGame theory has a wide range of applications, including psychology, evolutionary biology, war, politics, economics, and business. Despite its many advances, game theory is still a young and developing science.\n\n### \n\n*According to game theory, the actions and choices of all the participants affect the outcome of each. And it's assumed players within the game are rational and will strive to maximize their payoffs in the game.2*\n\n### Game Theory Definitions\n\nAny time we have a situation with two or more players that involve known payouts or quantifiable consequences, we can use game theory to help determine the most likely outcomes. Let's start by defining a few terms commonly used in the study of game theory:\n\n* **Game**: Any set of circumstances that has a result dependent on the actions of two or more decision-makers (players)\n* **Players**: A strategic decision-maker within the context of the game\n* **Strategy**: A complete plan of action a player will take given the set of circumstances that might arise within the game\n* **Payoff**: *T*he payout a player receives from arriving at a particular outcome (The payout can be in any quantifiable form, from dollars to [utility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utility.asp).)\n* **Information set**: The information available at a given point in the game (The term information set is most usually applied when the game has a sequential component.)\n* **Equilibrium**: The point in a game where both players have made their decisions and an outcome is reached\n\n### The Nash Equilibrium\n\n[Nash equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nash-equilibrium.asp) is an outcome reached that, once achieved, means no player can increase payoff by changing decisions unilaterally. It can also be thought of as \"no regrets,\" in the sense that once a decision is made, the player will have no regrets concerning decisions considering the consequences.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium is reached over time, in most cases. However, once the Nash equilibrium is reached, it will not be deviated from. After we learn how to find the Nash equilibrium, take a look at how a unilateral move would affect the situation. Does it make any sense? It shouldn't, and that's why the Nash equilibrium is described as \"no regrets.\" Generally, there can be more than one equilibrium in a game.\n\nHowever, this usually occurs in games with more complex elements than two choices by two players. In simultaneous games that are repeated over time, one of these multiple equilibria is reached after some trial and error. This scenario of different choices overtime before reaching equilibrium is the most often played out in the business world when two firms are determining prices for highly interchangeable products, such as airfare or soft drinks.\n\n### Impact on Economics and Business\n\nGame theory brought about a revolution in economics by addressing crucial problems in prior mathematical economic models. For instance, neoclassical economics struggled to understand entrepreneurial anticipation and could not handle the imperfect competition. Game theory turned attention away from steady-state equilibrium toward the market process.\n\nIn business, game theory is beneficial for modeling competing behaviors between economic agents. Businesses often have several strategic choices that affect their ability to realize economic gain. For example, businesses may face dilemmas such as whether to retire existing products or develop new ones, lower prices relative to the competition, or employ new marketing strategies. Economists often use game theory to understand [oligopoly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oligopoly.asp) firm behavior. It helps to predict likely outcomes when firms engage in certain behaviors, such as price-fixing and [collusion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collusion.asp).\n\n## Types of Game Theories\n\nAlthough there are many types (e.g., symmetric/asymmetric, simultaneous/sequential, etc.) of game theories, cooperative and non-cooperative game theories are the most common. Cooperative game theory deals with how coalitions, or cooperative groups, interact when only the payoffs are known. It is a game between coalitions of players rather than between individuals, and it questions how groups form and how they allocate the payoff among players.\n\nNon-cooperative game theory deals with how rational economic agents deal with each other to achieve their own goals. The most common non-cooperative game is the strategic game, in which only the available strategies and the outcomes that result from a combination of choices are listed. A simplistic example of a real-world non-cooperative game is rock-paper-scissors. \n\n## Examples of Game Theory\n\nThere are several \"games\" that game theory analyzes. Below, we will just briefly describe a few of these.\n\n### The Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nThe [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp) is the most well-known example of game theory. Consider the example of two criminals arrested for a crime. Prosecutors have no hard evidence to convict them. However, to gain a confession, officials remove the prisoners from their solitary cells and question each one in separate chambers. Neither prisoner has the means to communicate with each other. Officials present four deals, often displayed as a 2 x 2 box.\n\n1. If both confess, they will each receive a five-year prison sentence. \n2. If Prisoner 1 confesses, but Prisoner 2 does not, Prisoner 1 will get three years and Prisoner 2 will get nine years. \n3. If Prisoner 2 confesses, but Prisoner 1 does not, Prisoner 1 will get 10 years, and Prisoner 2 will get two years. \n4. If neither confesses, each will serve two years in prison. \n\nThe most favorable strategy is to not confess. However, neither is aware of the other's strategy and without certainty that one will not confess, both will likely confess and receive a five-year prison sentence. The Nash equilibrium suggests that in a prisoner's dilemma, both players will make the move that is best for them individually but worse for them collectively.\n\nThe expression \"[tit for tat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tit-for-tat.asp)\" has been determined to be the optimal strategy for optimizing a prisoner's dilemma. Tit for tat was introduced by Anatol Rapoport, who developed a strategy in which each participant in an iterated prisoner's dilemma follows a course of action consistent with their opponent's previous turn. For example, if provoked, a player subsequently responds with retaliation; if unprovoked, the player cooperates.\n\n### Dictator Game \n\nThis is a simple game in which Player A must decide how to split a cash prize with Player B, who has no input into Player A’s decision. While this is not a game theory strategy *per se*, it does provide some interesting insights into people’s behavior. Experiments reveal about 50% keep all the money to themselves, 5% split it equally, and the other 45% give the other participant a smaller share.\n\nThe dictator game is closely related to the ultimatum game, in which Player A is given a set amount of money, part of which has to be given to Player B, who can accept or reject the amount given. The catch is if the second player rejects the amount offered, both A and B get nothing. The dictator and ultimatum games hold important lessons for issues such as charitable giving and philanthropy.\n\n### Volunteer’s Dilemma\n\nIn a volunteer’s dilemma, someone has to undertake a chore or job for the common good. The worst possible outcome is realized if nobody volunteers. For example, consider a company in which [accounting fraud is rampant](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/detecting-financial-fraud.asp), though top management is unaware of it. Some junior employees in the accounting department are aware of the fraud but hesitate to tell top management because it would result in the employees involved in the fraud being fired and most likely prosecuted.\n\nBeing labeled as a whistleblower may also have some repercussions down the line. But if nobody volunteers, the large-scale fraud may result in the company’s eventual bankruptcy and the loss of everyone’s jobs.\n\n### The Centipede Game\n\nThe [centipede game](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centipede-game.asp) is an extensive-form game in game theory in which two players alternately get a chance to take the larger share of a slowly increasing money stash. It is arranged so that if a player passes the stash to their opponent who then takes the stash, the player receives a smaller amount than if they had taken the pot.\n\nThe centipede game concludes as soon as a player takes the stash, with that player getting the larger portion and the other player getting the smaller portion. The game has a pre-defined total number of rounds, which are known to each player in advance.\n\n## Limitations of Game Theory\n\nThe biggest issue with game theory is that, like most other economic models, it relies on the assumption that people are rational actors that are self-interested and utility-maximizing. Of course, we are social beings who do cooperate and do care about the welfare of others, often at our own expense. Game theory cannot account for the fact that in some situations we may fall into a Nash equilibrium, and other times not, depending on the social context and who the players are.\n\n## What Are the Games Being Played in Game Theory?\n\nIt is called game theory since the theory tries to understand the strategic actions of two or more \"players\" in a given situation containing set rules and outcomes. While used in several disciplines, game theory is most notably used as a tool within the study of business and economics. The \"games\" may involve how two competitor firms will react to price cuts by the other, whether a firm should acquire another, or how traders in a stock market may react to price changes. In theoretic terms, these [games may be categorized](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111113/advanced-game-theory-strategies-decisionmaking.asp) as prisoner's dilemmas, the dictator game, the hawk-and-dove, and Bach or Stravinsky.\n\n## What Are Some of the Assumptions About These Games?\n\nLike many economic models, game theory also contains a set of strict assumptions that must hold for the theory to make good predictions in practice. First, all players are utility-maximizing rational actors that have full information about the game, the rules, and the consequences. Players are not allowed to communicate or interact with one another. Possible outcomes are not only known in advance but also cannot be changed. The number of players in a game can theoretically be infinite, but most games will be put into the context of only two players.\n\n## What is a Nash Equilibrium?\n\nThe Nash equilibrium is an important concept referring to a stable state in a game where no player can gain an advantage by unilaterally changing a strategy, assuming the other participants also do not change their strategies. The Nash equilibrium provides the solution concept in a non-cooperative (adversarial) game. It is named after John Nash who received the Nobel in 1994 for his work.3\n\n## Who Came Up with Game Theory?\n\nGame theory is largely attributed to the work of mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s and was developed extensively by many other researchers and scholars in the 1950s.", "timestamp": 1654657006, "digest": "Ku769Wh_BdKWY3Xs12MVgtkzNHp9EAh8NgctIltQgDU", "contributor": "0xCA995bA5397441eB0EA7A24c11b02f8CdC2f18e7"}

真正链改意味着抛弃原有商业模式，那还不如不改全部推倒重来就好了，或者换个思路是：如果项目方真的想把这个crypto项目做好，而不是为了给原有项目借尸还魂或者蹭热点充估值，应该在评估各种“链改”的局限性后考虑放弃链改（当然不绝对）重新利用现有的流量资源做一个native web3的东西\n\\*\\*Andre Cronje, @AndreCronjeTech

当他的小说作品在发表后得到事实核查时，作者继续在 Twitter 上佩戴它作为荣誉徽章。 我们并不完美。我们过去曾犯过错误，正如您对一家在颠覆性新行业中运营的年轻公司所期望的那样。 但这并不能赋予他们忽视讲述客观故事的义务的权利。它甚至不必平衡。公平的。 随着政策制定者继续就应该如何监管这个行业进行辩论，我们将尽自己的一份力量，回应每一次询问，尽可能支持执法，并承认我们的错误。我每周与 5-10 名记者交谈。我有时不同意记者如何报道我们或我们行业的特定方面。没关系。大多数人都希望写一个客观的故事。外部批评是健康的。如果没有任何批评，那就更令人担忧了。只需要公平和向上。如果您在该文章发布之前没有阅读我们与路透社的电子邮件交流，我鼓励您阅读。

在此线程中，我将分解您需要了解的内容，2/ 首先，值得设置一些背景，因为 staking 是加密货币中的一个广义术语， Chainlink Staking 通过应用奖励和惩罚来激励网络的正常运行，引入了新的加密经济安全层，3/ 使用#Chainlink Staking，有四个长期目标， 这些是其发展的指导原则，也是确定 Staking 成功的支柱，4/ 目标一：增加 Chainlink 服务的加密经济安全性和用户保证 ， $LINK代币被锁定，如果预言机网络表现不佳，则$LINK权益可以被削减（带走）并重新分配给受影响的用户 ， 攻击变得更加昂贵，5/ 目标二：让社区参与到 Chainlink 网络中， 节点运营商和普通代币持有者都可以直接参与 Staking ， 这包括在预言机网络表现不佳时因发出警报而获得奖励 ， 非常需要代币和社区，6/ 目标三：从真正的长期使用中产生可持续的回报， $LINK中的原生代币排放将为质押者创造初始的基本奖励水平 ， 随着时间的推移，大部分奖励将来自用户费用和其他非排放来源，7/ 目标四：授权节点运营商通过质押获得更高价值的工作 ， 随着节点运营商在性能方面接近平价，他们将开始通过他们可以质押多少$LINK来争夺工作和收入 ， 这导致了一个高度稳健的信誉系统，8/ 考虑到这些目标，重要的是要注意 Chainlink 质押将随着时间的推移而发展 ， 计划于今年晚些时候进行的初步实施将侧重于创建一个简单而安全的基础 ， 这允许收集反馈并测试假设，<https://twitter.com/ChainLinkGod/status/1534310009743581184>\n$LINK在 Chainlink 宣布包括代币质押的新路线图后不久，价格突破了区间并上涨至 9 美元。\nStaking 是#Chainlink经济学的新时代， 从作为预言机服务的支付令牌转变为通过保护这些预言机服务来获得收入的权利 ， 这里的潜在市场不仅仅是区块链应用程序，还有全球经济，\n你可以说这是 Chainlink 的新时代，发布发布路线图是第一次， 质押时收到的推文线程\n新的#Chainlink博客文章刚刚发布了大量关于质押數的新信息， - 高达 5% APR 的年化奖励， - 初始池大小为 25M

{"id": "ZKecww1IO7UIc_OtyIi4viqnYEAUDPf1kDIgfg6p_bU", "title": "Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)", "body": "## What Is Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)?\n\nDays payable outstanding (DPO) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time (in days) that a company takes to pay its bills and invoices to its trade creditors, which may include suppliers, vendors, or financiers. The ratio is typically calculated on a quarterly or annual basis, and it indicates how well the company’s cash outflows are being managed.\n\nA company with a higher value of DPO takes longer to pay its bills, which means that it can retain available funds for a longer duration, allowing the company an opportunity to use those funds in a better way to maximize the benefits. A high DPO, however, may also be a red flag indicating an inability to pay its bills on time.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Days payable outstanding (DPO) computes the average number of days a company needs to pay its bills and obligations.\n* Companies that have a high DPO can delay making payments and use the available cash for short-term investments as well as to increase their working capital and free cash flow.\n* However, higher values of DPO, though desirable, may not always be a positive for the business as it may signal a cash shortfall and inability to pay.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 53 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:53\n\n#### Days Payable Outstanding\n\n## Formula for Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{DPO} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Accounts Payable}\\\\times\\\\text{Number of Days}}{\\\\text{COGS}}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{COGS}=\\\\text{Cost of Goods Sold} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad\\\\ \\\\ \\\\, \\\\,= \\\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\\\text{P} -\\\\text{Ending Inventory}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{P}=\\\\text{Purchases} \\\\end{aligned}​DPO=COGSAccounts Payable×Number of Days​where:COGS=Cost of Goods Sold  =Beginning Inventory+P−Ending InventoryP=Purchases​﻿\n\n## How To Calculate DPO\n\nTo manufacture a salable product, a company needs raw material, utilities, and other resources. In terms of accounting practices, the accounts payable represents how much money the company owes to its supplier(s) for purchases made on credit.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cost associated with manufacturing the salable product, and it includes payment for utilities like electricity and employee wages. This is represented by [cost of goods sold (COGS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp), which is defined as the cost of acquiring or manufacturing the products that a company sells during a period. Both of these figures represent cash outflows and are used in calculating DPO over a period of time.\n\nThe number of days in the corresponding period is usually taken as 365 for a year and 90 for a quarter. The formula takes account of the average per day cost being borne by the company for manufacturing a salable product. The numerator figure represents payments outstanding. The net factor gives the average number of days taken by the company to pay off its obligations after receiving the bills.\n\nTwo different versions of the DPO formula are used depending upon the accounting practices. In one of the versions, the accounts payable amount is taken as the figure reported at the end of the accounting period, like “at the end of fiscal year/quarter ending Sept. 30.” This version represents the DPO value as of the mentioned date.\n\nIn another version, the average value of beginning AP and ending AP is taken, and the resulting figure represents the DPO value during that particular period. COGS remains the same in both versions.\n\n## What Does DPO Tell You?\n\nGenerally, a company acquires inventory, utilities, and other necessary services on credit. It results in [accounts payable (AP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp), a key accounting entry that represents a company's obligation to pay off the short-term liabilities to its creditors or suppliers. Beyond the actual dollar amount to be paid, the timing of the payments*—*from the date of receiving the bill till the cash actually going out of the company’s account*—*also becomes an important aspect of the business. DPO attempts to measure this average time cycle for outward payments and is calculated by taking the standard accounting figures into consideration over a specified period of time.\n\nCompanies having high DPO can use the available cash for short-term investments and to increase their [working capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) and [free cash flow (FCF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp). However, higher values of DPO may not always be a positive for the business. If the company takes too long to pay its creditors, it risks jeopardizing its relations with the suppliers and creditors who may refuse to offer the trade credit in the future or may offer it on terms that may be less favorable to the company. The company may also be losing out on any discounts on timely payments, if available, and it may be paying more than necessary.\n\nAdditionally, a company may need to balance its outflow tenure with that of the inflow. Imagine if a company allows a 90-day period for its customers to pay for the goods they purchase but has only a 30-day window to pay its suppliers and vendors. This mismatch will result in the company being prone to cash crunch frequently. Companies must strike a delicate balance with DPO.\n\nA high DPO can indicate a company that is using capital resourcefully but it can also show that the company is struggling to pay its creditors.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nTypical DPO values vary widely across different industry sectors and it is not worthwhile comparing these values across different sector companies. A firm's management will instead compare its DPO to the average within its industry to see if it is paying its vendors too quickly or too slowly. Depending upon the various global and local factors, like the overall performance of the economy, region, and sector, plus any applicable seasonal impacts, the DPO value of a particular company can vary significantly from year to year, company to company, and industry to industry.\n\nDPO value also forms an integral part of the formula used for calculating the [cash conversion cycle (CCC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashconversioncycle.asp), another key metric that expresses the length of time that a company takes to convert the resource inputs into realized cash flows from sales. While DPO focuses on the current outstanding payable by the business, the superset CCC follows the entire cash time-cycle as the cash is first converted into inventory, expenses, and accounts payable, through to sales and accounts receivable, and then back into cash in hand when received.\n\n## Example of How DPO Is Used\n\nAs a historical example, the leading retail corporation Walmart [(WMT)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=wmt) had accounts payable worth $49.1 billion and cost of sales (cost of goods sold) worth $420.3 billion for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2021.1 These figures are available in the annual [financial statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) and [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) of the company. Taking the number of days as 365 for annual calculation, the DPO for Walmart comes to \\[ (49.1 x 365) / 420.1 \\] = 42.7 days.\n\nSimilar calculations can be used for technology leader Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=msft), which had $2.8 billion as AP and $41.3 billion as COGS, leading to a DPO value of 24.7 days.2\n\nIt indicates that during the fiscal year ending in 2021, Walmart paid its invoices around 43 days after receiving the bills, while Microsoft took around 25 days, on average, to pay its bills.\n\nA look at similar figures for the online retail giant Amazon [(AMZN)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn), which had an AP of $72.5 billion and COGS of $233.3 billion for the fiscal year 2020, reveals a very high value of 113.4 days. Such high value of DPO is attributed to the working model of Amazon, which roughly has 50% of its sales being supplied by third-party sellers.3 Amazon instantly receives funds in its account for the sale of goods that are actually supplied by third-party sellers using Amazon’s online platform.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t pay the sellers immediately after the sale but may send accumulated payments based on a weekly/monthly or threshold-based payment cycle. This working mechanism allows Amazon to hold onto the cash for a longer period of time, and the leading online retailer ends up with a significantly higher DPO.\n\n## Limitations of DPO\n\nWhile DPO is useful in comparing relative strength among companies, there is no clear-cut figure for what constitutes a healthy days payable outstanding, as the DPO varies significantly by industry, competitive positioning of the company, and its bargaining power. Large companies with a strong power of negotiation are able to contract for better terms with suppliers and creditors, effectively producing lower DPO figures than they would have otherwise.\n\n## What Does Days Payable Outstanding Mean in Accounting?\n\nAs a financial ratio, days of payable outstanding (DPO) shows the amount of time that companies take to pay financiers, creditors, vendors, or suppliers. The DPO may indicate a few things, namely, how a company is managing its cash, or the means for a company to utilize this cash towards short-term investments that in turn may amplify their cash flow. The DPO is measured on a quarterly or annual term.\n\n## How Do You Calculate Days Payable Outstanding?\n\nTo calculate days of payable outstanding (DPO), the following formula is applied: DPO = Accounts Payable X Number of Days/Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Here, COGS refers to beginning inventory plus purchases subtracting the ending inventory. Accounts payable, on the other hand, refers to company purchases that were made on credit that are due to its suppliers.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between DPO and DSO?\n\nDays payable outstanding (DPO) is the average time for a company to pay its bills. By contrast, days sales outstanding (DSO) is the average length of time for sales to be paid back to the company. When a DSO is high, it indicates that the company is waiting extended periods to collect money for products that it sold on credit. By contrast, a high DPO could be interpreted multiple ways, either indicating that the company is utilizing its cash on hand to create more working capital, or indicating poor management of free cash flow.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstE89rcVascvBR9cHY8-zhfOCxuZs9h7w3Yr-0uBj1N7edmJTpPXJsqNDE7sFGxwM33asbqTcyP6w63cl_U2XPhoRKRcYlFi_HFCsIZKTiX2rfaBaZcYpQqrmN_J5hysucJQ96Zb17coISdnbp_b8K-doZDYnULf5AjDJx2KZdQx1LnvAGpYJkiL8pNoqy-z48_xdvMuLDa5BV2rKc-00NFUHwirNlrOx-m8fCaqTBuA6su7GulCf-kS2pIXsccx7_4-hxi7Z5-lgj320Tel4uZOhU-lsUlreC2jGbOJitFkyUzpdYBKRe_yKdJJEINg4ouNCs-X5s8n_4hY9mY35tJ3Nb5IpGF-oP85w-shhO6t0w&sig=Cg0ArKJSzHcKfT6cNQ0zEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstE89rcVascvBR9cHY8-zhfOCxuZs9h7w3Yr-0uBj1N7edmJTpPXJsqNDE7sFGxwM33asbqTcyP6w63cl_U2XPhoRKRcYlFi_HFCsIZKTiX2rfaBaZcYpQqrmN_J5hysucJQ96Zb17coISdnbp_b8K-doZDYnULf5AjDJx2KZdQx1LnvAGpYJkiL8pNoqy-z48_xdvMuLDa5BV2rKc-00NFUHwirNlrOx-m8fCaqTBuA6su7GulCf-kS2pIXsccx7_4-hxi7Z5-lgj320Tel4uZOhU-lsUlreC2jGbOJitFkyUzpdYBKRe_yKdJJEINg4ouNCs-X5s8n_4hY9mY35tJ3Nb5IpGF-oP85w-shhO6t0w&sig=Cg0ArKJSzHcKfT6cNQ0zEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "AF4rjjpYrRW1BbARVghSWa_JZzyckST4rczCg2v9UB0", "title": "Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)", "body": "## What Is the Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)?\n\nThe debt-service coverage ratio applies to corporate, government, and personal finance. In the context of corporate finance, the debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) is a measurement of a firm's available [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) to pay current debt obligations. The DSCR shows investors whether a company has enough income to pay its debts. \n \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) is a measure of the cash flow available to pay current debt obligations.\n* DSCR is used to analyze firms, projects, or individual borrowers.\n* The minimum DSCR that a lender demands depends on macroeconomic conditions. If the economy is growing, lenders may be more forgiving of lower ratios.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 39 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:39\n\n#### The Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)\n\n## Formula and Calculation of the Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)\n\n### DSCR Formula and Calculation\n\nThe formula for the debt-service coverage ratio requires [net operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noi.asp) and the total [debt servicing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtservice.asp) for the entity. Net operating income is a company's revenue minus certain operating expenses (COE), not including taxes and interest payments. It is often considered the equivalent of [earnings before interest and tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT).\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{DSCR} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Net Operating Income} }{ \\\\text{Total Debt Service} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Net Operating Income} = \\\\text{Revenue} - \\\\text{COE} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{COE} = \\\\text{Certain operating expenses} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Total Debt Service} = \\\\text{Current debt obligations} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​DSCR=Total Debt ServiceNet Operating Income​where:Net Operating Income=Revenue−COECOE=Certain operating expensesTotal Debt Service=Current debt obligations​\n\nSome calculations include [non-operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-operating-income.asp) in EBIT. As a lender or investor comparing different companies' creditworthiness—or a manager comparing different years or quarters—it is important to apply consistent criteria when calculating DSCR. As a borrower, it is important to realize that lenders may calculate DSCR in slightly different ways.\n\nTotal debt service refers to current debt obligations, meaning any interest, principal, sinking fund, and [lease](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lease.asp) payments that are due in the coming year. On a [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp), this will include short-term debt and the [current portion of long-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentportionlongtermdebt.asp).\n\nIncome taxes complicate DSCR calculations because [interest payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp) are tax deductible, while [principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp) repayments are not. A more accurate way to calculate total debt service is, therefore, to compute the following:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{TDS} = ( \\\\text{Interest} \\\\times ( 1 - \\\\text{Tax Rate} ) ) + \\\\text{Principal} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{TDS} = \\\\text{Total debt service} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​TDS=(Interest×(1−Tax Rate))+Principalwhere:TDS=Total debt service​\n\n### Calculating DSCR Using Excel\n\nTo create a dynamic DSCR formula in Excel, you cannot simply run an equation that divides net operating income by debt service. Rather, you would title two successive cells, such as A2 and A3, \"net operating income\" and \"debt service.\" Then, adjacent to those cells, in B2 and B3, you would place the respective figures from the income statement.\n\nIn a separate cell, enter a formula for DSCR that uses the B2 and B3 cells rather than actual numeric values (e.g., B2 / B3).\n\nEven for a calculation this simple, it is best to use a dynamic formula that can be adjusted and recalculated automatically. One of the primary reasons to calculate DSCR is to compare it to other firms in the industry, and these comparisons are easier to run if you can simply plug in the numbers.\n\n## What Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) Can Tell You\n\nIn the context of government finance, the DSCR is the amount of [export](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp) earnings needed by a country to meet annual interest and principal payments on its external debt. In the context of personal finance, it is a ratio used by bank loan officers to determine [income property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income_property.asp) loans.\n\nWhether the context is corporate finance, government finance, or personal finance, the debt-service coverage ratio reflects the ability to service [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp) given a particular level of income. The ratio states net operating income as a multiple of debt obligations due within one year, including interest, principal, [sinking funds, ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sinkingfund.asp)and lease payments.\n\nLenders will routinely assess a borrower's DSCR before making a loan. A DSCR of less than 1 means negative cash flow, which means that the borrower will be unable to cover or pay current debt obligations without drawing on outside sources—in essence, borrowing more.\n\nFor example, a DSCR of 0.95 means that there is only sufficient net operating income to cover 95% of annual debt payments. In the context of personal finance, this would mean that the borrower would have to delve into their personal funds every month to keep the project afloat. In general, lenders frown on negative cash flow, but some allow it if the borrower has strong resources in addition to their income.\n\nIf the debt-service coverage ratio is too close to 1, for example, 1.1, the entity is vulnerable, and a minor decline in cash flow could render it unable to service its debt. Lenders may, in some cases, require that the borrower maintain a certain minimum DSCR while the loan is outstanding. Some agreements will consider a borrower who falls below that minimum to be in default. Typically, a DSCR greater than 1 means the entity—whether an individual, company, or government—has sufficient income to pay its current debt obligations.\n\nThe minimum DSCR a lender will demand can depend on macroeconomic conditions. If the economy is growing, credit is more readily available, and lenders may be more forgiving of lower ratios. A tendency to lend to less-qualified borrowers can, in turn, affect the economy's stability, as was the case leading up to the [2008 financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp). [Subprime borrowers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-borrower.asp) were able to obtain credit, particularly mortgages, with little scrutiny. When these borrowers began to default en masse, the financial institutions that had financed them collapsed.1\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nLet's say a real estate developer is looking to obtain a mortgage loan from a local bank. The lender will want to calculate the DSCR to determine the ability of the developer to borrow and pay off their loan as the rental properties they build generate income.\n\nThe developer indicates that net operating income will be $2,150,000 per year, and the lender notes that debt service will be $350,000 per year. The DSCR is calculated as 6.14x, which should mean the borrower can cover their debt service more than six times given their operating income.\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{DSCR} = \\\\frac{ \\\\$2,150,000 }{ \\\\$350,000 } = 6.14 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​DSCR=$350,000$2,150,000​=6.14​﻿\n\n### Interest Coverage Ratio vs. DSCR\n\nThe [interest coverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestcoverageratio.asp) indicates the number of times that a company's operating profit will cover the interest it must pay on all debts for a given period. This is expressed as a ratio and is most often computed on an annual basis.\n\nTo calculate the interest coverage ratio, simply divide the EBIT for the established period by the total interest payments due for that same period. The EBIT, often called net operating income or operating profit, is calculated by subtracting overhead and operating expenses, such as rent, cost of goods, freight, wages, and utilities, from revenue. This number reflects the amount of cash available after subtracting all expenses necessary to keep the business running.\n\nThe higher the ratio of EBIT to interest payments, the more financially stable the company. This metric only considers interest payments and not payments made on principal debt balances that may be required by lenders.\n\nThe debt-service coverage ratio is slightly more comprehensive. This metric assesses a company's ability to meet its minimum principal and interest payments, including sinking fund payments, for a given period. To calculate DSCR, EBIT is divided by the total amount of principal and interest payments required for a given period to obtain net operating income. Because it takes into account principal payments in addition to interest, the DSCR is a slightly more robust indicator of a company's financial fitness.\n\nIn either case, a company with a debt-service coverage ratio of less than 1.00 does not generate enough revenue to cover its minimum debt expenses. In terms of business management or investment, this represents a risky prospect since even a brief period of lower-than-average income could spell disaster.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nA limitation of the interest coverage ratio is that it does not explicitly consider the ability of the firm to repay its debts. Most long-term debt issues contain provisions for [amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp) with dollar sums involved comparable to the interest requirement, and failure to meet the sinking fund requirement is an act of [default ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp)that can force the firm into bankruptcy. A ratio that attempts to measure the repayment ability of a firm is the [fixed charge coverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-chargecoverageratio.asp).\n\n## How Do You Calculate the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)?\n\nThe DSCR is calculated by taking net operating income and dividing it by total debt service (which includes the principal and interest payments on a loan). For example, if a business has a net operating income of $100,000 and a total debt service of $60,000, its DSCR would be approximately 1.67.\n\n## Why Is the DSCR Important?\n\nDSCR is a commonly used metric when negotiating loan contracts between companies and banks. For instance, a business applying for a line of credit might be obligated to ensure that their DSCR does not dip below 1.25. If it does, the borrower could be found to have defaulted on the loan. In addition to helping banks manage their risks, DSCRs can also help analysts and investors when analyzing a company’s financial strength.\n\n## What Is a Good DSCR?\n\nA “good” DSCR depends on the company’s industry, competitors, and stage of growth. For instance, a smaller company that is just beginning to generate cash flow might face lower DSCR expectations compared to a mature company that is already well established. As a general rule, however, a DSCR above 1.25 is often considered “strong,” whereas ratios below 1.00 could indicate that the company is facing financial difficulties.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsu6iTKFqTYupuYBHH-wm3nWUPOemrvcbWa_bwSPPH7rGhaiuRKADRtlUIq0kbHGmkamvedoOsSITQAiF3nqgFymIrSvn-wEMcDuC3acGeSlB_dy94w3QkrJ5X8wOvNouZ_0-Xuxkvcflc-RU9DngrRT73SYqpXcBqul3EDwHEOt7ymk8OrpIKDVvRgHSfXi5Bvw6HJPAXcFFWh7qDJcy1tKrYUgF89WdeTG7fINCAh5Hg0qiMTlWocdUtCoAjYWZO6rHR2kf6S9meJL2Ih5D1VCfJP3H2cYQfHtZcz2ih8UfAv1_mmsbitQO1jTt2cVJ_hz3ASZsoNQ3YDSngOy6RC1-pxun61ldYYBmObwcpmVVgw&sig=Cg0ArKJSzIwqJw4Jd_UrEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsu6iTKFqTYupuYBHH-wm3nWUPOemrvcbWa_bwSPPH7rGhaiuRKADRtlUIq0kbHGmkamvedoOsSITQAiF3nqgFymIrSvn-wEMcDuC3acGeSlB_dy94w3QkrJ5X8wOvNouZ_0-Xuxkvcflc-RU9DngrRT73SYqpXcBqul3EDwHEOt7ymk8OrpIKDVvRgHSfXi5Bvw6HJPAXcFFWh7qDJcy1tKrYUgF89WdeTG7fINCAh5Hg0qiMTlWocdUtCoAjYWZO6rHR2kf6S9meJL2Ih5D1VCfJP3H2cYQfHtZcz2ih8UfAv1_mmsbitQO1jTt2cVJ_hz3ASZsoNQ3YDSngOy6RC1-pxun61ldYYBmObwcpmVVgw&sig=Cg0ArKJSzIwqJw4Jd_UrEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "BO28pg6jP3tVOmwPkD2t8N_ZN1XlOJ5e0NxNrZWsAmQ", "title": "Debt Ratio", "body": "## What Is the Debt Ratio?\n\nThe term debt ratio refers to a financial ratio that measures the extent of a company’s [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp). The debt ratio is defined as the ratio of [total debt to total assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebttototalassets.asp), expressed as a decimal or percentage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt. A ratio greater than 1 shows that a considerable portion of a company's debt is funded by assets, which means the company has more liabilities than assets. A high ratio indicates that a company may be at risk of default on its loans if interest rates suddenly rise. A ratio below 1 means that a greater portion of a company's assets is funded by equity.12\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A debt ratio measures the amount of leverage used by a company in terms of total debt to total assets.\n* This ratio varies widely across industries, such that capital-intensive businesses tend to have much higher debt ratios than others.\n* A company's debt ratio can be calculated by dividing total debt by total assets.\n* A debt ratio of greater than 1.0 or 100% means a company has more debt than assets while a debt ratio of less than 100% indicates that a company has more assets than debt.\n* Some sources consider the debt ratio to be total liabilities divided by total assets.\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 6 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n2:06\n\n#### Debt Ratio\n\n## Understanding Debt Ratios\n\nAs noted above, a company's debt ratio is a measure of the extent of its financial leverage. This ratio varies widely across industries. Capital-intensive businesses, such as utilities and pipelines tend to have much higher debt ratios than others like the [technology sector](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technology_sector.asp).\n\nThe formula for calculating a company's debt ratio is: \n \n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Debt ratio} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total debt}}{\\\\text{Total assets}} \\\\end{aligned}​Debt ratio=Total assetsTotal debt​​\n\nSo if a company has total assets of $100 million and total debt of $30 million, its debt ratio is 0.3 or 30%. Is this company in a better financial situation than one with a debt ratio of 40%? The answer depends on the [industry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp). \n \n\nA debt ratio of 30% may be too high for an industry with volatile [cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp), in which most businesses take on little [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp). A company with a high debt ratio relative to its peers would probably find it expensive to borrow and could find itself in a crunch if circumstances change. Conversely, a debt level of 40% may be easily manageable for a company in a sector such as utilities, where cash flows are stable and higher debt ratios are the norm.3\n\nA debt ratio greater than 1.0 (100%) tells you that a company has more debt than [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). Meanwhile, a debt ratio of less than 100% indicates that a company has more assets than debt. Used in conjunction with other measures of financial health, the debt ratio can help investors determine a company's [risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp) level.3 \n \n\n### \n\n*The [fracking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fracking.asp)​ industry experienced tough times beginning in the summer of 2014 due to high levels of debt and plummeting energy prices.4*\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nSome sources consider the debt ratio to be total [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp) divided by total assets. This reflects a certain ambiguity between the terms debt and liabilities that depends on the circumstance. The [debt-to-equity ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp), for example, is closely related to and more common than the debt ratio, instead, using total liabilities as the numerator.\n\nFinancial data providers calculate it using only [long-term](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermdebt.asp) and [short-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp) (including [current portions of long-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentportionlongtermdebt.asp)), excluding liabilities such as [accounts payable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp), [negative goodwill](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negativegoodwill.asp), and others.\n\nIn the consumer lending and mortgages business, two common debt ratios used to assess a borrower’s ability to repay a loan or mortgage are the gross [debt service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtservice.asp) ratio and the [total debt service ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebtserviceratio.asp).\n\nThe gross debt ratio is defined as the ratio of monthly housing costs (including [mortgage payments](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/payment-structure/), home insurance, and property costs) to monthly income, while the total debt service ratio is the ratio of monthly housing costs plus other debt such as car payments and credit card borrowings to monthly income.5 Acceptable levels of the total debt service ratio range from the mid-30s to the low-40s in percentage terms.6 \n \n\nThe higher the debt ratio, the more leveraged a company is, implying greater financial risk. At the same time, leverage is an important tool that companies use to grow, and many businesses find sustainable uses for debt. \n\n## Debt Ratio vs. Long-Term Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nWhile the total debt to total assets ratio includes all debts, the [long-term debt to assets ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-term-debt-to-total-assets-ratio.asp) only takes into account long-term debts. The debt ratio (total debt to assets) measure takes into account both long-term debts, such as mortgages and securities, and current or short-term debts such as rent, utilities, and loans maturing in less than 12 months.\n\nBoth ratios, however, encompass all of a business's assets, including tangible assets such as equipment and inventory and intangible assets such as accounts receivables. Because the total debt to assets ratio includes more of a company's liabilities, this number is almost always higher than a company's long-term debt to assets ratio. \n\n## Examples of the Debt Ratio\n\nLet's look at a few examples from different industries to contextualize the debt ratio.\n\n### Starbucks\n\nStarbucks ([SBUX](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=sbux)) listed $0 in short-term and current portion of long-term debt on its balance sheet for the fiscal year ended Oct. 1, 2017, and $3.93 billion in long-term debt. The company's total assets were $14.37 billion.7 This gives us a debt ratio of $3.93 billion ÷ $14.37 billion = 0.2734, or 27.34%.\n\nTo assess whether this is high, we should consider the [capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) that go into opening a Starbucks, including leasing commercial space, renovating it to fit a certain layout, and purchasing expensive specialty equipment, much of which is used infrequently. The company must also hire and train employees in an industry with exceptionally high employee turnover, adhere to food safety regulations for its more than 27,000 locations in 75 countries in 2017.8\n\nPerhaps 27% isn't so bad after all when you consider that the industry average was about 65% in 2017.9 The result is that Starbucks has an easy time borrowing money—creditors trust that it is in a solid financial position and can be expected to pay them back in full.\n\n### Meta\n\nWhat about a technology company? For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016, Meta ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=fb)), formerly Facebook, reported:\n\n* Short-term and current portion of long-term debt as $280 million\n* Long-term debt as $5.77 billion\n* Total assets as $64.96 billion10\n\nUsing these figures, Meta's debt ratio can be calculated as ($280 million + $5.7 billion) ÷ $64.96 billion = 0.092, or 9.2%. The company does not borrow from the [corporate bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp) market.11 It has an easy enough time raising capital through stock.\n\n### Arch Coal\n\nNow let's look at a [basic materials](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic_materials.asp) company. For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016, St. Louis-based miner Arch Coal ([ARCH](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=arch)) posted short-term and current portions of long-term debt of $11 million, long-term debt of $351.84 million, and total assets of $2.14 billion.12\n\nCoal mining is extremely capital-intensive, so the industry is forgiving of leverage: The average debt ratio was 61% in 2016.13 Even in this cohort, Arch Coal's debt ratio of ($11 million + $351.84 million) ÷ $2.14 billion = 16.95% is well below average. \n \n\n## What Are Some Common Debt Ratios?\n\nAll debt ratios analyze a company's relative debt position. Common debt ratios include debt-to-equity, debt-to-assets, long-term debt-to-assets, and leverage and gearing ratios.\n\n## What Is a Good Debt Ratio?\n\nWhat counts as a good debt ratio will depend on the nature of the business and its industry. Generally speaking, a debt-to-equity or debt-to-assets ratio below 1.0 would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would be considered risky. Some industries, such as banking, are known for having much higher debt-to-equity ratios than others.\n\n## What Does a Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.5 Indicate?\n\nA debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5 would indicate that the company in question has $1.50 of debt for every $1 of equity. To illustrate, suppose the company had assets of $2 million and liabilities of $1.2 million. Since equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, the company’s equity would be $800,000. Its debt-to-equity ratio would therefore be $1.2 million divided by $800,000, or 1.5.\n\n## Can a Debt Ratio Be Negative?\n\nIf a company has a negative debt ratio, this would mean that the company has negative shareholder equity. In other words, the company's liabilities outnumber its assets. In most cases, this is considered a very risky sign, indicating that the company may be at risk of bankruptcy.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssxDKQ932JdQBKQ8qfwBSebhU7jl6IhQSeagkxJrC7z71DJzca6wC02aXJ9eTD1p873c6TZ0D0BMoejJ4DrbWN_--JxQj2Rtb5_Oyn7Ex7mYvIZAwXU3ypFrbp2yd1tOuQrpbureajVJc_ifVbExnBtGTlF5Cv5MrKlXWtVhrzR_tMPL8JPWPhZyE1n3YxU9G0XGt0dhfOmdfZG1iKxgSCV4dQ1bbYO6DQsnP9UvuPso_NFyNl62D9j5FC_lI2PVUlEyLBQV_KjCLo25mYBCqeBz3JyU-eKa-GthJUSchiJ9Xzl8hH-5oq6sTDiI1bNsFM7qFnVZD-P_-EsJVD0E_iVMTWOVTjG02d_m-EZSS6vNkg&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKS4l0olhk-NEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssxDKQ932JdQBKQ8qfwBSebhU7jl6IhQSeagkxJrC7z71DJzca6wC02aXJ9eTD1p873c6TZ0D0BMoejJ4DrbWN_--JxQj2Rtb5_Oyn7Ex7mYvIZAwXU3ypFrbp2yd1tOuQrpbureajVJc_ifVbExnBtGTlF5Cv5MrKlXWtVhrzR_tMPL8JPWPhZyE1n3YxU9G0XGt0dhfOmdfZG1iKxgSCV4dQ1bbYO6DQsnP9UvuPso_NFyNl62D9j5FC_lI2PVUlEyLBQV_KjCLo25mYBCqeBz3JyU-eKa-GthJUSchiJ9Xzl8hH-5oq6sTDiI1bNsFM7qFnVZD-P_-EsJVD0E_iVMTWOVTjG02d_m-EZSS6vNkg&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKS4l0olhk-NEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

The Great Depression ran between 1929 and 1941, which was the same year that the United States entered World War II in 1941. This period was accentuated by a number of economic contractions, including the [stock market crash of 1929](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1929.asp) and banking panics that occurred in 1930 and 1931.\n\nEconomists and historians often cite the Great Depression as one of the largest—if not the most—catastrophic economic events of the 20th century.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Great Depression was the greatest and longest economic recession in modern world history that ran between 1929 and 1941.\n* Investing in the speculative market in the 1920s led to the stock market crash in 1929, which wiped out a great deal of nominal wealth.\n* Most historians and economists agree that the stock market crash of 1929 wasn't the only cause of the Great Depression.\n* Other factors including inactivity followed by overaction by the Fed also contributed to the Great Depression.\n* Both Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt tried to mitigate the impact of the depression through government policies.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 44 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:44\n\n#### What Is an Economic Depression?\n\n## The Stock Market Crash\n\nDuring the short depression that lasted from 1920 to 1921, known as the Forgotten Depression, the U.S. [stock market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp) fell by nearly 50%, and corporate profits declined by over 90%.1 The U.S. economy enjoyed robust growth during the rest of the decade. The Roaring Twenties, as the era came to be known, was a period when the American public discovered the stock market and dove in headfirst.\n\nSpeculative frenzies affected both the real estate markets and the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE).2 Loose money supply and high levels of [margin trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) by investors helped to fuel an unprecedented increase in asset prices.3\n\nThe lead-up to October 1929 saw equity prices rise to all-time high multiples of more than 19-times after-tax corporate earnings.4 This, coupled with the benchmark [Dow Jones Industrial Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp) (DJIA) increasing 500% in just five years, ultimately [caused the stock market crash](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/what-caused-stock-market-crash-1929-preceded-great-depression.asp).5\n\nThe NYSE bubble burst violently on Oct. 24, 1929, a day that came to be known as [Black Thursday](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackthursday.asp).6 A brief rally occurred Friday the 25th and during a half-day session Saturday the 26th. However, the following week brought Black Monday (Oct. 28) and Black Tuesday (Oct. 29). The DJIA fell more than 20% over those two days.7 The stock market would eventually fall almost 90% from its 1929 peak.5\n\nRipples from the crash spread across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe triggering other financial crises such as the collapse of the Boden-Kredit Anstalt, Austria’s most important bank. In 1931, the economic calamity hit both continents in full force.8\n\n## The U.S. Economy Tailspin\n\nThe 1929 stock market crash wiped out [nominal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominal.asp) wealth, both corporate and private, sending the U.S. economy into a tailspin. In early 1929, the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.2%. By 1933, it soared over 25%.910\n\nDespite unprecedented interventions and government spending by both the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations, the unemployment rate remained above 18.9% in 1938. Real [per capita gross domestic product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp) (GDP) was below 1929 levels by the time the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in late 1941. \n \n\nWhile the crash likely triggered the decade-long economic downturn, most historians and economists agree that the crash alone did not cause the Great Depression. Nor does it explain why the slump's depth and persistence were so severe. A variety of specific events and policies contributed to the Great Depression and helped to prolong it during the 1930s.\n\n## Mistakes by the Young Federal Reserve\n\nThe relatively new [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp) mismanaged the supply of money and credit before and after the crash in 1929. According to monetarists such as [Milton Friedman](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/milton-friedman.asp) and acknowledged by former Federal Reserve Chair [Ben Bernanke](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benbernanke.asp).11 \n \n\nCreated in 1913, the Fed remained fairly inactive throughout the first eight years of its existence. After the economy recovered from the 1920 to 1921 depression, the Fed allowed significant [monetary expansion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expansionary_policy.asp).12 The total money supply grew by $28 billion, a 61.8% increase between 1921 and 1928.13 Bank deposits increased by 51.1%, savings and loan shares rose by 224.3%, and net life insurance policy reserves jumped 113.8%. All of this occurred after the Federal Reserve cut required reserves to 3% in 1917. Gains in gold reserves via the Treasury and Fed were only $1.16 billion.14\n\nBy increasing the money supply and keeping the [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) low during the decade, the Fed instigated the rapid expansion that preceded the collapse. Much of the surplus money supply growth inflated the stock market and real estate bubbles.\n\nAfter the bubbles burst and the market crashed, the Fed took the opposite course by cutting the money supply by nearly a third. This reduction caused severe [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) problems for many small banks and choked off hopes for a quick recovery. \n \n\n### \n\n*Trade routes created during World War II remained open during the Great Depression and helped the market recover.*\n\n## The Fed's Tight Fist\n\nAs Bernanke noted in a November 2002 address, before the Fed existed, bank panics were typically resolved within weeks. Large private financial institutions would loan money to the strongest smaller institutions to maintain system integrity.11 That sort of scenario had occurred two decades earlier, during the [Panic of 1907](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-panic-of-1907.asp).\n\nWhen frenzied selling sent the NYSE spiraling downward and led to a bank run, investment banker [J.P. Morgan stepped in](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/federal-reserve.asp#jp-morgan-and-the-panic-of-1907) to rally [Wall Street](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wallstreet.asp) denizens to move significant amounts of [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) to banks lacking funds.15 Ironically, it was that panic that led the government to create the Federal Reserve to cut its reliance on individual financiers such as Morgan.\n\nAfter Black Thursday, the heads of several New York banks had tried to instill confidence by prominently purchasing large blocks of [blue-chip stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechipstock.asp) at above-market prices.16 While these actions caused a brief rally Friday, the panicked sell-offs resumed Monday. In the decades since 1907, the stock market grew beyond the ability of such individual efforts. Now, only the Fed was big enough to prop up the U.S. financial system.\n\nThe Fed failed to do so with a [cash injection](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-injection.asp) between 1929 and 1932. Instead, it watched the money supply collapse and let thousands of banks fail. At the time, banking laws made it very difficult for institutions to grow and diversify enough to survive a massive withdrawal of deposits or [run on the bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp).\n\nWhile difficult to understand, the Fed's harsh reaction may have been the result of its fear that [bailing out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bailout.asp) careless banks would only encourage fiscal irresponsibility in the future. Some historians argue that the Fed created the conditions that caused the economy to overheat and then exacerbated an already dire economic situation.\n\n## Hoover's Propped-Up Prices\n\nHerbert Hoover took action after the crash occurred even though he's often characterized as a \"do-nothing\" president.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1932, he implemented:\n\n* An increase to federal spending by 42%, which engaged in massive public works programs such as the [Reconstruction Finance Corporation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rfc.asp) (RFC)17\n* Taxes to pay for new programs\n* A ban on immigration in 1930 to keep low-skilled workers from flooding the [labor market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-market.asp)18\n\nHoover was mainly concerned with the fact that wages would be cut following the economic downturn. He reasoned that prices needed to stay high to ensure high paychecks in all industries. To keep prices high, consumers would need to pay more.\n\nBut the public was burned badly in the crash, leaving many people without the resources to spend lavishly on goods and services. Nor could companies count on overseas [trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade.asp), as foreign nations were not willing to buy overpriced American goods any more than Americans were. \n \n\nMany of his and Congress' other post-crash interventions, such as wage, labor, trade, and price controls, damaged the economy's ability to adjust and reallocate resources.18\n\n## U.S. Protectionism\n\nThis bleak reality forced Hoover to use legislation to prop up prices and hence wages by choking out cheaper foreign competition. Following the tradition of [protectionists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp), and against the protests of more than 1,000 of the nation's economists, Hoover signed into law the [Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smoot-hawley-tariff-act.asp).\n\nThe act was initially a way to protect agriculture but swelled into a multi-industry [tariff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp), imposing huge duties on more than 880 foreign products. Nearly three dozen countries retaliated, and imports fell from $7 billion in 1929 to just $2.5 billion in 1932. By 1934, international trade had declined by 66%. Not surprisingly, economic conditions worsened worldwide.19\n\nHoover's desire to maintain jobs and individual and corporate income levels was understandable. However, he encouraged businesses to raise wages, avoid [layoffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/layoff.asp), and keep prices high at a time when they naturally should have fallen. With previous cycles of recession/depression, the United States suffered one to three years of low wages and [unemployment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp) before dropping prices led to a recovery. Unable to sustain these artificial levels, and with global trade effectively cut off, the U.S. economy deteriorated from a recession to a depression.\n\n## The New Deal\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt promised massive change when he was voted-in in 1933. [The New Deal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/new-deal.asp) he initiated was an innovative, unprecedented series of domestic programs and acts designed to bolster American business, reduce unemployment, and protect the public.20\n\nLoosely based on [Keynesian economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp), it was based on the fact that the government could and should stimulate the economy. The New Deal set lofty goals to create and maintain the national [infrastructure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp), full employment, and healthy wages. The government set about achieving these goals through price, wage, and even production controls.21\n\nSome economists claim that Roosevelt continued many of Hoover's interventions, just on a larger scale. He kept in place a rigid focus on price supports and minimum wages and removed the country from the [gold standard](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldstandard.asp), forbidding individuals to hoard gold coins and bullion.22 He banned monopolistic business practices and instituted dozens of new public works programs and other job-creation agencies.\n\nThe Roosevelt administration paid farmers and ranchers to stop or cut back on production. One of the most heartbreaking conundrums of the period was the destruction of excess crops, despite the need for thousands of Americans to access affordable food.21\n\nFederal taxes tripled between 1933 and 1940 to pay for these initiatives as well as new programs such as [Social Security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialsecurity.asp). These increases included hikes in excise taxes, personal income taxes, inheritance taxes, corporate income taxes, and an excess profits tax.20\n\n## New Deal Success and Failure\n\nThe New Deal led to measurable results, such as financial system reform and stabilization, boosting public confidence. Roosevelt declared a bank holiday for an entire week in March 1933 to prevent institutional collapse due to panicked [withdrawals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withdrawal.asp). This was followed by a construction program for a network of dams, bridges, tunnels, and roads. These projects opened up federal work programs, employing thousands of people.\n\nAlthough the economy showed some recovery, the [rebound was far too weak ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011116/economic-effects-new-deal.asp)for the New Deal's policies to be unequivocally deemed successful in pulling America out of the Great Depression. Historians and economists disagree on the reason:\n\n* Keynesians blame a lack of federal spending, saying that Roosevelt did not go far enough in his government-centric recovery plans\n* Others claim that by trying to spark immediate improvement instead of letting the economic/[business cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp) follow its usual two-year course of hitting bottom and then rebounding, Roosevelt may have prolonged the depression, just like Hoover did before him\n\nA study by two economists at the University of California, Los Angeles estimated that the New Deal extended the Great Depression by at least seven years.23 But it is possible that the relatively quick recovery, which was characteristic of other post-depression recoveries, may not have occurred as rapidly post-1929. That's because it was the first time the general public (not just the [Wall Street](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100814/wall-streets-enduring-impact-economy.asp) elite) lost large amounts in the stock market.\n\nAmerican economic historian Robert Higgs argued that Roosevelt's new rules and regulations came so fast and were so revolutionary that businesses became afraid to hire or invest.24 Philip Harvey, a professor of law and economics at Rutgers University, suggested that Roosevelt was more interested in addressing social welfare concerns than creating a Keynesian-style macroeconomic [stimulus package](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stimulus-package.asp).\n\n### \n\n*Social Security policies enacted by the New Deal created programs for unemployment, disability insurance, old-age, and widows' benefits.*\n\n## The Impact of World War II\n\nThe Great Depression appeared to end suddenly around 1941 to 1942. That's if we look at employment and GDP figures. This was just around the time that the United States entered World War II. The unemployment rate fell from eight million in 1940 to just over one million in 1943.25 However, more than 16 million Americans were conscripted to fight in the Armed Services.26 In the [private sector](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp), the real unemployment rate grew during the war.\n\nThe [standard of living](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp) declined due to wartime shortages caused by [rationing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rationing.asp), and taxes rose dramatically to fund the war effort. Private investment dropped from $17.9 billion in 1940 to $5.7 billion in 1943, and total private-sector production fell by nearly 50%.27\n\nAlthough the notion that the war ended the Great Depression is a [broken window fallacy](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp), the conflict did put the United States on the road to recovery. The war opened international trading channels and reversed price and wage controls. Government demand opened up for inexpensive products, and the demand created a massive fiscal stimulus.\n\nIn the first 12 months after the war ended, private investments rose from $10.6 billion to $30.6 billion. The stock market broke into a [bull run](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) in a few short years.\n\n## What Really Caused the Great Depression?\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint exactly what specific factor caused the Great Depression. But economists and historians generally agree that there were several mitigating factors that led to this period of downturn. These include the stock market crash of 1929, the gold standard, a drop in lending and tariffs, as well as banking panics, and contracted monetary policies by the Fed.\n\n## When Did the Great Depression Start?\n\nThe Great Depression started following the stock market crash of 1929, which wiped out both private and corporate nominal wealth. This sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin and eventually trickled out beyond the U.S. border to Europe.\n\n## When Did the Great Depression End?\n\nThe Great Depression ended in 1941. This was around the same time that the United States entered World War II. Most economists cite this as the end date, as this was the time that unemployment dropped and GDP increased.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe Great Depression was the result of an unlucky combination of factors, including a flip-flopping Fed, [protectionist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp) tariffs, and inconsistently applied government interventionist efforts. This period could have been shortened or even avoided by a change in any one of these factors.\n\nWhile the debate continues as to whether the interventions were appropriate, many of the reforms from the New Deal, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, and agricultural [subsidies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp), exist to this day. The assumption that the federal government should act in times of national economic crisis is now strongly supported. This legacy is one of the reasons the Great Depression is considered one of the seminal events in modern American history.", "timestamp": 1654657217, "digest": "LR-egle4vtcS04ZOdjBN8mS0YCeqCgbVCEFl5khxuCw", "contributor": "0x47A6871C8f80e124Ad08E4F1fD89524065ec8276"}

These are just a few of the many large investors who have added FAANG stocks to their [portfolios](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) because of their perceived strength, growth, or [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp). \n\nEach of the FAANG stocks trades on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) exchange and is included in the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp). Since the S&P 500 is a broad representation of the market, the movement of the market mirrors the index's movement. As of August 2021, the FAANGs make up about 19% of the S&P 500—a staggering figure considering the S&P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the [United States economy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/042915/5-industries-driving-us-economy.asp) as a whole.\n\nThis large influence over the index means that [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) in the stock price of the FAANG stocks can have a substantial effect on the performance of the S&P 500 in general. In August 2018, for example, FAANG stocks were responsible for nearly 40% of the index’s gain from the lows reached in February 2018.\n\n## Example of FAANG Stocks\n\nThe extraordinary size and influence of the FAANG stocks have prompted concerns about a potential [bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp) in FAANG stocks. These concerns started gaining prominence in 2018, when technology stocks, which had been driving consistent gains in the stock market, began losing their former strength. In November 2018, several FAANG stocks lost more than 20% of their valuations and were declared to be in [bear territory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp).6 By some estimates, FAANG stocks lost more than a trillion dollars from their peak valuations as a result of the steep drop in the markets in November 2018.6\n\nAlthough their valuations have since recovered, the level of volatility sometimes shown by FAANG stocks—and the oversized influence these stocks can have on the market overall—is a source of concern for some investors.\n\nOn the other hand, those who believe in the fundamental strength of the FAANG stocks have abundant evidence for this claim. For example, Facebook is the world’s largest [social network](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-networking.asp) with approximately 2.8 billion users. In its 2021 annual report, Meta posted revenues of $118 billion and [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) of $39.4 billion.7\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, has become a seemingly insurmountable force in [business-to-consumer (B2C)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp) e-commerce. With over 120 million products for sale, it has over 300 million active customers in the United States, of whom more than half pay for monthly Amazon Prime memberships.8 With 2021 TTM revenues of $470 billion and a net income of $33.4 billion, it is not hard to understand why investors believe Amazon’s vast market capitalization is justified.9\n\nOverall, it is through strong financial performance such as this that the FAANG stocks have prospered recently. Over the past five years, for instance, Meta and Amazon have seen stock-price increases of 185% and 500%, respectively. For their part, Apple and Alphabet saw price increases of about 175% over that same timeframe, whereas Netflix saw its value rise by nearly 450%.\n\n## What Makes FAANG Stocks So Popular?\n\nThe five stocks that make up the “FAANG” acronym—Meta ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=FB)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AMZN)), Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL4)), Netflix ([NFLX](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=NFLX)), and Alphabet ([GOOG](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GOOG))—are all well-known brands among consumers. But they are also famous for their remarkable growth in recent years, with market capitalizations ranging from $166 billion (in the case of Netflix) to $2.7 trillion (in the case of Apple), as of Q1 2022.32 From an investment perspective, these five stocks are generally praised for their stellar historical track records and clear leadership positions within their industries.\n\n## Are FAANG Stocks Overvalued?\n\nInvestors disagree about whether the FAANG stocks are overvalued. Their proponents will argue that their valuations are justified based on their fundamental strength as businesses. But critics argue that, even with impressive business performance, the FAANG stocks’ prices have become so expensive that it may be difficult to realize attractive long-term profits from investing in them. Ultimately, this “debate” between investors is best captured by the buying and selling patterns in the FAANG stocks themselves.\n\n## Are FAANG Stocks Hard to Acquire?\n\nNo. The FAANG stocks are all easy to acquire, in the sense that they are publicly traded companies with substantial daily trading volumes. They are also routinely included in popular [exchange-traded funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETFs). However, investors who believe that the FAANG stocks may be overvalued would argue that they are difficult to acquire at an economical price. These investors may be tempted to delay purchasing FAANG stocks, waiting for their valuations to decline.\n\n## Who Coined the Term FANG Stocks?\n\nWhile Jim Cramer certainly popularized the term, he himself credits Bob Lang, a *Real Money* and *The Street* colleague of Cramer's, with identifying these four stocks and inventing the acronym.", "timestamp": 1654657287, "digest": "XEM0YNdnAkFrI03dlOQfua1ptmqjtz55vwo5FdfVQOU", "contributor": "0xd97952A550A92BA0989255EEEACca3f5C901fCE2"}

However, [Delivered Duty Paid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delivery-duty-paid.asp) (DDP) indicates that the seller must cover duties, import clearance, and any taxes.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) is an international trade term meaning the seller is responsible for ensuring goods arrive safely to a destination; the buyer is responsible for import duties.\n* By contrast, Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) indicates that the seller must cover duties, import clearance, and any taxes.\n* DDU is still commonly used in transportation contracts, even though the International Chamber of Commerce has officially replaced it with the term Delivered-at-Place (DAP).\n* The primary benefit of delivered duty unpaid (DDU) shipping is that it gives the buyer more control over the shipping procedures.\n* From the seller's perspective, DDU shipping provides the ability to take more of a \"hands-off\" approach when it comes to the destination country's shipping rules.\n* The biggest problem for buyers in DDU shipping is the possibility of surprise duties and/or tax charges when their shipment finally arrives.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:06\n\n#### Delivery Duty Unpaid (DDU)\n\n## Understanding Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU)\n\nThe [International Chamber of Commerce](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-chamber-of-commerce-icc.asp) (ICC) is an organization that was originally formed after World War I with the goal of fostering prosperity in Europe by setting standards for international trade. It was this group that, in 1936, published a set of standardized terms for different types of shipping agreements, known as Incoterms.1\n\nIncoterms are contract specifications outlining who bears the costs and risks of [international transactions](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/); they are subject to change at the discretion of the ICC. Because of the legal and logistical intricacies of international shipping, the ICC seeks to simplify matters for businesses by standardizing its terms.\n\nNotably, 2020 Incoterms revision is [available for purchase](https://2go.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2020-eng-config+book_version-eBook) direct from the site.\n\nDelivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) was actually not included in the most recent (2010) edition of the International Chamber of Commerce's [Incoterms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incoterms.asp); the current official term that best describes the function of DDU is [Delivered-at-Place](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delivered-place-dap.asp) (DAP).2\n\nHowever, DDU is still commonly used in international trade parlance. On paper, the term is followed by the location of delivery (e.g., \"DDU: Port of Los Angeles\"). \n\n### DPU Shipping\n\n*Delivered at Place Unloaded (DPU) is the third term used to differentiate between shipping methods. Under DPU, the seller is also responsible for unloading the goods at the place of destination.*\n\n## Responsibilities Under Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU)\n\nAccording to DDU arrangements, the seller secures licenses and takes care of other formalities involved in exporting a good; it is also responsible for all licenses and costs incurred in transit countries, as well as for providing an invoice at its own cost.\n\nThe seller assumes all risk until the goods are delivered to the specified location, but it has no obligation to obtain insurance on the goods. \n\nThe buyer is responsible for obtaining all necessary licenses for importing the goods and paying all relevant taxes, [duties](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duty.asp), and inspection costs. All risks involved in this process are borne by the buyer. Once the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer, all further transportation costs and risks fall on the buyer.\n\nSeller Obligations vs. Seller Obligations Under DDU**Seller ObligationsBuyer Obligations**Delivers the goods, as well as the documentation that proves the buyer can take legal possession of them.Pays for the delivered goods.Responsible for all documentation required to export the goods.Responsible for all documentation required for import clearance once the shipment has arrived.Once the goods are delivered to the destination country, all risk is transferred to the buyer.Once the goods are delivered alongside the ship, the buyer is responsible for any loss or damage from that point on.Seller pays for the delivery, loading, labor, and transportation costs up to the destination country.Buyer pays for the import duties and taxes, customs charges, unloading costs, and delivery costs to their own warehouses.\n\n## Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) vs. Delivered Duty Paid (DDP)\n\nIn the world of shipping, delivered duty unpaid (DDU) simply means that it's the customer's responsibility to pay for any of the destination country's customs charges, duties, or taxes. These must all be paid in order for customs to release the shipment after it arrives.\n\nOn the other hand, delivered duty paid (DDP) means it's the shipper's responsibility to pay any of the customs charges, duties, and/or taxes required to send the product to the destination country.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU)\n\nThe primary benefit of delivered duty unpaid (DDU) shipping is that it gives the buyer more control over the shipping procedures. For global buyers looking to keep a consistent flow of inventory, having a higher degree of control over the process can be paramount.\n\nFor instance, controlling costs and tracking shipments are typically easier to do under DDU shipping than in DDP shipping. Buyers are naturally more knowledgeable of their own country's shipping customs.\n\nFrom the seller's perspective, DDU shipping provides the ability to take more of a \"hands-off\" approach when it comes to the destination country's shipping rules. The seller is simply responsible for getting the cargo to its destination, where the buyer can handle all of the legal complications.\n\nOf course, there are also disadvantages to DDU shipping. The biggest problem for buyers is the possibility of surprise duties or tax charges when their shipment finally arrives. Obviously, that's a big negative for buyers. But it's not ideal for shippers, either, because disgruntled customers may refuse to pay for their parcel to be delivered.\n\n## DDU Shipping FAQs\n\n### Is DDU Shipping or DDP Shipping Better?\n\nAs we've discussed, there are pros and cons to each method of shipping. So it ultimately boils down to what the buyer or receiver wants out of their shipping experience.\n\nIf the receiver prioritizes control of the shipping process and doesn't mind the legal complications or surprise charges that come with more control, DDU is a good option. But if a buyer wants a streamlined process without the possibility of any surprise charges, DDP is probably the way to go.\n\n### Who Is Responsible for DDU Shipments?\n\nUnder DDU shipping rules, the seller is fully responsible for the delivery of the goods to the destination country. The seller assumes all risks involved up to unloading.\n\nThe buyer bears the risk and cost of the unloading.\n\n### Is DAP the Same as DDU?\n\nDelivery-at-place (DAP) was introduced in 2010 to basically replace the term delivery duty unpaid (DDU), so they're essentially the same.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuQOfUYFDi_h0nYVtXrwUtfVD4K5-UHv4qZaFAzbF_D32ZBEKjpHk1Dt231zL4ht1P2sfUabfqvoTYKN8AcTGc_COhfNylX5H14VvD7jM_a7HSaKo71B4c8gE1rBBVZuRga80eQdk_uKVttinS8dsJcuYx_t-YFkz_HZmMLYfLsZGM7mAu6hKTwHpD1gblOj2ifZBCfgeicqnoUTTjijNb82IlH0aoSXEnOWW57ErrayfHM7U9_d0AymEUscOc3FNSdxTRCRDT-3_5GauCH6ReiBoZCfkajhvHZPLawCikqHL6IrEtHgRBnaqjFcB92YxNk66SmpAowk313i3MinBk-SJqL4eznGyE5-SEgpQqj1Uo&sig=Cg0ArKJSzFhwFM5nkI3zEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuQOfUYFDi_h0nYVtXrwUtfVD4K5-UHv4qZaFAzbF_D32ZBEKjpHk1Dt231zL4ht1P2sfUabfqvoTYKN8AcTGc_COhfNylX5H14VvD7jM_a7HSaKo71B4c8gE1rBBVZuRga80eQdk_uKVttinS8dsJcuYx_t-YFkz_HZmMLYfLsZGM7mAu6hKTwHpD1gblOj2ifZBCfgeicqnoUTTjijNb82IlH0aoSXEnOWW57ErrayfHM7U9_d0AymEUscOc3FNSdxTRCRDT-3_5GauCH6ReiBoZCfkajhvHZPLawCikqHL6IrEtHgRBnaqjFcB92YxNk66SmpAowk313i3MinBk-SJqL4eznGyE5-SEgpQqj1Uo&sig=Cg0ArKJSzFhwFM5nkI3zEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "6Swe14ZpInlnElC9-U8FLtVC3FNxu9Gtjz5grXLYnSo", "title": "Deferred Compensation", "body": "## What Is Deferred Compensation?\n\nDeferred compensation is a portion of an employee's compensation that is set aside to be paid at a later date. In most cases, taxes on this income are deferred until it is paid out. Forms of deferred compensation include [retirement plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement-planning.asp), [pension plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp), and stock-option plans.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Deferred compensation plans are an incentive that employers use to hold onto key employees.\n* Deferred compensation can be structured as either qualified or non-qualified.\n* The attractiveness of deferred compensation is dependent on the employee's personal tax situation.\n* These plans are best suited for high earners.\n* The main risk of deferred compensation is if the company goes bankrupt you may lose everything put away in the plan.\n\n## How Deferred Compensation Works\n\nAn employee may opt for deferred compensation because it offers potential tax benefits. In most cases, income tax is deferred until the compensation is paid out, usually when the employee retires. If the employee expects to be in a lower [tax bracket](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp) after retiring than when they initially earned the compensation, they have a chance to reduce their tax burden.\n\n[Roth 401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roth401k.asp)s are an exception, requiring the employee to pay taxes on income when it is earned. They may be preferable, however, for employees who expect to be in a higher tax bracket when they retire and would therefore rather pay taxes in their current, lower bracket. There are many more factors that affect this decision, such as changes to the law. [Investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) should consult a financial advisor before making decisions based on tax considerations.\n\n## Types of Deferred Compensation\n\nThere are two broad categories of deferred compensation: qualified deferred compensation and non-qualified deferred compensation. These differ greatly in their legal treatment and, from an employer's perspective, the purpose they serve. Deferred compensation is often used to refer to non-qualified plans, but the term technically covers both.\n\n### Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans\n\nQualified deferred compensation plans are pension plans governed by the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erisa.asp) (ERISA), including 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans. A company that has such a plan in place must offer it to all employees, though not to independent contractors. Qualifying deferred compensation is set off for the sole benefit of its recipients, meaning that [creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp) cannot access the funds if the company fails to pay its debts. Contributions to these plans are capped by law.\n\n### Non-Qualifying Deferred Compensation Plans\n\n[Non-qualified deferred compensation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nqdc.asp) (NQDC) plans, also known as 409(a) plans and \"[golden handcuffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldenhandcuffs.asp),\" provide employers with a way to attract and retain especially valuable employees, since they do not have to be offered to all employees and have no caps on contributions.\n\nIn addition, independent contractors are eligible for NQDC plans. For some companies, they offer a way to hire expensive talent without having to pay their full compensation immediately, meaning they can postpone funding these obligations. That approach, however, can be a gamble.\n\nNQDCs are contractual agreements between employers and employees, so while their possibilities are limited by laws and regulations, they are more flexible than qualified plans. For example, an NQDC might include a [non-compete clause](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncompete-agreement.asp).\n\nCompensation is usually paid out when the employee retires, although payout can also begin on a fixed date, upon a change in ownership of the company, or due to disability, death, or a (strictly defined) emergency. Depending on the terms of the contract, deferred compensation might be retained by the company if the employee is fired, defects to a competitor, or otherwise forfeits the benefit. Early distributions on NQDC plans trigger heavy [IRS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) penalties.\n\nFrom the employee's perspective, NQDC plans offer the possibility of a reduced tax burden and a way to save for retirement. Due to contribution limits, highly compensated executives may only be able to invest tiny portions of their income in qualified plans; NQDC plans do not have this disadvantage.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a risk that if the company goes bankrupt, creditors will seize funds for NQDC plans, since these do not have the same protections qualified plans do. This can make NQDCs a risky option for employees whose distributions begin years down the line, or whose companies are in a weak financial position. \n\nNQDCs take different forms, including stock or options, deferred savings plans, and [supplemental executive retirement plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/serp.asp) (SERPs), otherwise known as \"top hat plans.\"\n\nAt the time of the deferral, the employee pays Social Security and Medicare taxes on the deferred income just as on the rest of their income but does not have to pay income tax on the deferred compensation until the funds are actually received.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Deferred Compensation\n\nDeferred compensation plans are best suited for high-income earners who want to put away funds for retirement. Like 401(k) plans or IRAs, the money in these plans grows tax-deferred and the contributions can be deducted from taxable income in the current period. Unlike 401(k)s or IRAs there are no contribution limits to a deferred compensation plan, so you can defer up to all of your annual bonus, for example, as retirement income.\n\nThere are, however, some drawbacks. Unlike a 401(k), with a deferred compensation plan you are effectively a creditor of the company, lending them the money you have deferred. If the company declares bankruptcy in the future, you may lose some or all of this money. Even if the company remains solid, your money is locked up in many cases until retirement, meaning that you cannot access it easily.\n\nDepending on the plan's structure, you also may find yourself with very limited investment options, for instance, it may only include company stock. Unlike with a 401(k) plan, when funds are received from a deferred compensation plan, they cannot be rolled over into an IRA account. Nor can deferred compensation funds be borrowed against.\n\nPros\n\n* No contribution limits\n* Tax-deferred asset growth\n* Current-period tax deduction\n\nCons\n\n* Can lose money if the company goes bankrupt\n* Illiquid\n* Only intended for high earners\n* No way to borrow against\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Is Deferred Compensation a Good Idea?\n\nIt all depends. For most employees, saving for retirement via a company's 401(k) is most appropriate. However, high-income employees may want to defer a greater amount of their income for retirement without the limits imposed by a 401(k) or IRA.\n\n### What Are the Benefits of a Deferred Compensation Plan?\n\nAside from no contribution limits, these plans offer tax-deferred growth and a tax deduction in the period that the contributions are made. This means that if you retire with a lower tax bracket, or in a state that does not levy income tax, you can greatly benefit in the future.\n\n### What Is the Difference Between a 401(k) and a Deferred Compensation Plan?\n\nDeferred compensation plans are more informal and less secure than 401(k) plans as a result. 401(k) plans are highly regulated and are sponsored by an employer. Deferred compensation is simply a plan in which an employee defers accepting a part of their compensation until a specified future date. Financial advisors usually suggest using a deferred compensation plan only after having made the maximum possible contribution to a 401(k) plan—and only if the company an individual is employed by is considered very financially solid.\n\n### How Is a Deferred Compensation Paid Out?\n\nThe distribution date, which may be at retirement or after a specified number of years, must be designated at the time the plan is set up and cannot be changed. It is generally advantageous for the employee to defer compensation to avoid having all of the deferred income distributed at the same time, as this typically results in the employee receiving enough money to put them in the highest possible tax bracket for that year. Note that distributions cannot be rolled into a qualified retirement plan.\n\n### How Does Deferred Compensation Affect Your Taxes?\n\nThose making contributions to a plan enjoy a tax deduction in that year, which can help one also avoid alternative minimum tax (AMT). The funds then grow tax-deferred until withdrawals are made at retirement. If you retire in a lower tax bracket or lower-tax jurisdiction you will benefit from the tax deferral upon retirement.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvGAXSLv38iP_BMkUz_eZlgyN0N_yT7xGhQNRJB6cmZIwPAlW8boSQpLu-SWX6gvtQH36wljSJV5qXJtfFd7IF8e70wyRU_7IieTVVgM8bz-zdcAojCDf9alVf17YMLuuLE197VoevrSd18wfOFHEDwHwtiTRQgwlInfbe8FuaEBzmKeYetFCml0_VCxbwG7KyLvLaX-rgxR6yugG5VmcWqvqw4RHBOPxQyiYgrT3-EpqXxLUrLS---dH7JadZdSqWmC71puVJ1qMdfSFfTYgKDTyhV_ZWTkXlCKLJu89cPMPjAviiPqBwZ47pDxLF5GX8pRIDdSyv_1PNiw_7--tID8lAt-g&sig=Cg0ArKJSzCOFNtun5i5AEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

Unlike variable-income securities, where payments change based on some underlying measure—such as short-term interest rates—the payments of a fixed-income security are known in advance.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Fixed-Income security provides investors with a stream of fixed periodic interest payments and the eventual return of principal upon its maturity.\n* Bonds are the most common type of fixed-income security, but others include CDs, money markets, and preferred shares.\n* Not all bonds are created equal. In other words, different bonds have different terms as well as credit ratings assigned to them based on the financial viability of the issuer.\n* The U.S. Treasury guarantees government fixed-income securities, making these very low risk, but also relatively low-return investments.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:17\n\n#### Fixed-Income Security\n\n## Fixed-Income Securities Explained\n\nFixed-Income securities are debt instruments that pay [a fixed amount of interest](https://www.investopedia.com/3-dividend-stocks-to-trade-as-interest-rate-cut-looms-4707419)—in the form of [coupon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) payments—to investors. The interest payments are typically made semiannually while the principal invested returns to the investor at [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp). Bonds are the most common form of [fixed-income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) securities. Companies raise capital by issuing [fixed-income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) products to investors.\n\nA [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) is an investment product that is issued by corporations and governments to raise funds to finance projects and fund operations. Bonds are mostly comprised of corporate bonds and [government bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp) and can have various maturities and face value amounts. The face value is the amount the investor will receive when the bond matures. Corporate and government bonds trade on major exchanges and usually are listed with $1,000 face values, also known as the par value.\n\n## Credit Rating Fixed Income Securities\n\nNot all bonds are created equal meaning they have different credit ratings assigned to them based on the financial viability of the issuer. Credit ratings are part of a grading system performed by [credit-rating agencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-rating-agencies.asp). These agencies measure the creditworthiness of corporate and government bonds and the entities ability to repay these loans. Credit ratings are helpful to investors since they indicate the risks involved in investing.\n\nBonds can either be investment grade on non-investment grade bonds. Investment grade bonds are issued by stable companies with a low risk of default and, therefore, have lower interest rates than non-investment grade bonds. Non-investment grade bonds, also known as [junk bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp) or high-yield bonds, have very low credit ratings due to a high probability of the corporate issuer defaulting on its interest payments.\n\nAs a result, investors typically require a higher rate of interest from junk bonds to compensate them for taking on the higher risk posed by these debt securities.\n\n## Types of Fixed-Income Securities\n\nAlthough there are many types of fixed-income securities, below we've outlined a few of the most popular in addition to corporate bonds.\n\n**[Treasury notes ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp)**(T-notes) are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are intermediate-term bonds that mature in two, three, five, or 10 years. T-Notes usually have a face value of $1,000 and pay semiannual interest payments at fixed coupon rates or interest rates. The interest payment and principal repayment of all Treasurys are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which issues these bonds to fund its debts.\n\nAnother type of fixed-income security from the U.S. Treasury is the **[Treasury bond ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp)**(T-bond) which matures in 30 years. Treasury bonds typically have par values of $10,000 and are sold on auction on TreasuryDirect.\n\nShort-term fixed-income securities include **[Treasury bills](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp)**. The T-bill matures within one year from issuance and doesn't pay interest. Instead, investors can buy the security at a lower price than its face value, or a [discount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-discount.asp). When the bill matures, investors are paid the face value amount. The interest earned or return on the investment is the difference between the purchase price and the face value amount of the bill.\n\nA **[municipal bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp)** is a government bond issued by states, cities, and counties to fund capital projects, such as building roads, schools, and hospitals. The interest earned from these bonds is tax exempt from federal income tax. Also, the interest earned on a \"muni\" bond might be exempt from state and local taxes if the investor resides in the state where the bond is issued. The muni bond has several maturity dates in which a portion of the principal comes due on a separate date until the entire principal is repaid. Munis are usually sold with a $5,000 face value.\n\nA bank issues a **[certificate of deposit ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp)**(CD). In return for depositing money with the bank for a predetermined period, the bank pays interest to the account holder. CDs have maturities of less than five years and typically pay lower rates than bonds, but higher rates than traditional savings accounts. A CD has Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ([FDIC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp)) insurance up to $250,000 per account holder. In order to get the most out of this kind of security, be sure to do your research to determine what [CDs offer the best rates](https://www.investopedia.com/best-cd-rates-4770214) currently available.\n\nCompanies issue **[preferred stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp)** that provide investors with a fixed [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp), set as a dollar amount or percentage of share value on a predetermined schedule. Interest rates and inflation influence the price of preferred shares, and these shares have higher yields than most bonds due to their longer duration.\n\n## Benefits of Fixed-Income Securities\n\nFixed-income securities provide steady interest income to investors throughout the life of the bond. Fixed-income securities can also reduce the overall risk in an investment portfolio and protect against [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) or wild fluctuations in the market. Equities are traditionally more volatile than bonds meaning their price movements can lead to bigger capital gains but also larger losses. As a result, many investors allocate a portion of their portfolios to bonds to reduce the risk of volatility that comes from stocks.\n\nIt's important to note that the prices of bonds and fixed income securities can increase and decrease as well. Although the interest payments of fixed-income securities are steady, their prices are not guaranteed to remain stable throughout the life of the bonds.\n\nFor example, if investors sell their securities before maturity, there could be gains or losses due to the difference between the purchase price and sale price. Investors receive the face value of the bond if it's held to maturity, but if it's sold beforehand, the selling price will likely be different from the face value.\n\nHowever, fixed income securities typically offer more stability of principal than other investments. Corporate bonds are more likely than other corporate investments to be repaid if a company declares bankruptcy. For example, if a company is facing bankruptcy and must liquidate its assets, bondholders will be repaid before common stockholders.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury guarantees government fixed-income securities and considered safe-haven investments in times of economic uncertainty. On the other hand, corporate bonds are backed by the financial viability of the company. In short, corporate bonds have a higher risk of default than government bonds. Default is the failure of a debt issuer to make good on their interest payments and principal payments to investors or bondholders.\n\nFixed-income securities are easily traded through a broker and are also available in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Mutual funds and ETFs contain a blend of many securities in their funds so that investors can buy into many types of bonds or equities.\n\nPros\n\n* Fixed-income securities provide steady interest income to investors throughout the life of the bond\n* Fixed-income securities are rated by credit rating agencies allowing investors to choose bonds from financially-stable issuers\n* Although stock prices can fluctuate wildly over time, fixed-income securities usually have less price volatility risk\n* Fixed-income securities such as U.S. Treasuries are guaranteed by the government providing a safe return for investors\n\nCons\n\n* Fixed-income securities have credit risk meaning the issuer can default on making the interest payments or paying back the principal\n* Fixed-income securities typically pay a lower rate of return than other investments such as equities\n* Inflation risk can be an issue if prices rise by a faster rate than the interest rate on the fixed-income security\n* If interest rates rise at a faster rate than the rate on a fixed-income security, investors lose out by holding the lower yielding security\n\n## Risks of Fixed-Income Securities\n\nAlthough there are many benefits to fixed-income securities and are often considered safe and stable investments, there are some risks associated with them. Investors must weigh the pros and cons of before investing in fixed-income securities.\n\nInvesting in fixed-income securities usually results in low returns and slow [capital appreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp) or price increases. The principal amount invested can be tied up for a long time, particularly in the case of long-term bonds with maturities greater than 10 years. As a result, investors don't have access to the cash and may take a loss if they need the money and cash in their bonds early. Also, since fixed-income products can often pay a lower return than equities, there's the opportunity of lost income.\n\nFixed-income securities have interest rate risk meaning the rate paid by the security could be lower than interest rates in the overall market. For example, an investor that purchased a bond paying 2% per year might lose out if interest rates rise over the years to 4%. Fixed-income securities provide a fixed interest payment regardless of where interest rates move during the life of the bond. If rates rise, existing bondholders might lose out on the higher rates.\n\nBonds issued by a high-risk company may not be repaid, resulting in loss of principal and interest. All bonds have credit risk or default risk associated with them since the securities are tied to the issuer's financial viability. If the company or government struggles financially, investors are at risk of default on the security. Investing in [international bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internationalbond.asp) can increase the risk of default if the country is economically or politically unstable.\n\nInflation erodes the return on fixed-rate bonds. Inflation is an overall measure of rising prices in the economy. Since the interest rate paid on most bonds is fixed for the life of the bond, inflation risk can be an issue if prices rise by a faster rate than the interest rate on the bond. If a bond pays 2% and inflation is rising by 4%, the bondholder is losing money when factoring in the rise in prices of goods in the economy. Ideally, investors want fixed-income security that pays a high enough interest rate that the return beats out inflation.\n\n## Real World Examples of Fixed-Income Securities\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Treasury bonds are long-term bonds with a maturity of 30 years. T-Bonds provide semiannual interest payments and usually have $1,000 face values. The 30-year Treasury bond that was issued March 15, 2019, paid a rate of [3.00%](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult.htm). In other words, investors would be paid 3.00% or $30 on their $1,000 investment each year. The $1,000 principal would be paid back in 30 years.\n\nOn the other hand, the 10-year Treasury note that was issued March 15, 2019, paid a rate of [2.625%.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult.htm) The bond also pays semiannual interest payments at fixed coupon rates and usually has a $1,000 face value. Each bond would pay $26.25 per year until maturity.\n\nWe can see that the shorter-term term bond pays a lower rate than the long-term bond because investors demand a higher rate if their money is going to be tied up longer in longer-term fixed-income security.", "timestamp": 1654657684, "digest": "Dzcto3ZURxD9nkgO-6Ts5ERoWrMbcGVTZjTvi5ZJiw8", "contributor": "0x9095A086909D24Dc0642339656011E4484C05d1B"}
{"id": "Cc1c8TbG5JCEQ438sbtsq2GVhRD7dXnMsOUW99m43-4", "title": "基于区块链技术的去中心化身份平台研究(上）", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_o7W5U9w6rYF339sUQA9e.gif?height=200&width=540)\n\n**一 、什么是去中心化身份**\n\n去中心化身份（DID）是基于身份管理的信任框架，**它允许用户在不依赖特定服务提供商的情况下生成和控制自己的数字身份**。根据Forrester的说法，“去中心化数字身份 (DID) 不仅仅是一个技术流行语：它承诺将当前中心化的物理和数字身份生态系统彻底重组为去中心化和民主化的架构。”\n\n在整Web3.0的架构中，去中心化身份（Decentralized Identity，DID）是至关重要的一环。DID与Web3.0的核心理念相符，允许用户拥有并控制自己的数字身份。\n\nDID中包含用户的身份信息和隐私数据，只有在经过用户授权的情况下才能使用，具有安全性、可验证和互操作性等特点。DID系统以去中心化的方式实现身份的发现、识别和验证，不依赖中心化身份系统的审核和许可。\n\n随着互联网的出现和普及，传统的身份有了另外一种表现形式，即数字身份。一般认为，数字身份的演进经历了四个阶段，分别是:中心化身份、联盟身份、以用户为中心的身份以及自我主权身份。\n\n**1、中心化身份**是由单一的权威机构进行管理和控制的，现在互联网上的大多数身份还是中心化身份。\n\n例如我们熟悉的支付宝、微信等账号。显然，中心化身份的使用权由中心主体和用户共同享有，但身份的生成权、解释权、存储权都集中在身体提供商，由此带来了身份不自主可控、隐私泄漏、可移植性差、互操作性差以及单点风险等一系列问题。\n\n**2、联盟身份**的出现解决了中心化身份中身份数据零碎混乱的弊端，此种身份是有多个机构或者联盟进行管理和控制的，用户的身份数据具备了一定程度的可移植性。\n\n例如允许用户登录某个网站时，可以使用其他网站的账户信息，类似于FB、GOOGLE或者APPLE的跨平台登录。\n\n**3、以用户为中心的身份**希望实现的是用户通过授权和许可，可以决定身份的存储和使用以及将身份从一个服务共享到另一个服务。\n\n因此侧重于三个元素：用户的许可、互操作性以及基于用户对数据的完全掌控。但是，以用户为中心的身份计划并没有获得成功。\n\n以OpenID为例，用户理论上可以注册属于自己的OpenID，但是由于技术门槛较高，普通的互联网用户更倾向于在一个公共的并且相对可靠的网站上注册OpenID来登录到其他的网站。\n\n因此，用户注册的OpenID有着随时被网络提供商剥夺的风险，这意味着，用户并没有完全取得自己身份数据的掌控权。\n\n**4、自我主权身份**才是真正意义上的去中心化的、完全由个人所拥有和控制的身份。要使身份具有真正的自我主权，这种基础设施必然需要驻留在分散信任的环境中。而随着区块链技术的出现，自我主权身份的实现找到了突破口。\n\n**分布式身份从根本上解决了中心化身份的问题，不依赖于中心身份提供商，真正具备身份的自主可控性、安全性、自解释性、可移植性、互操作性。**在分布式场景下赋予每个用户自主控制和使用数字身份的能力，并针对身份数据等敏感信息进行隐私保护。\n\nWeb3.0向我们描绘了一个万物互联的可信网络世界，**实现了数据的确权与授权、强隐私保护、开放的抗审查的自由数据交换。**以DID为基础构建去中心化运行的统一身份认证平台正是Web3.0发展的重要实践之一。\n\n**二 、去中心化身份的优势**\n\n通过区块链技术，使用自主权的数字身份允许用户真正拥有并控制自己的个人数据和资产。相对于传统的身份认证，基于区块链技术的数字身份认证具有保证数据真实有效、保护用户隐私安全、可实现跨部门、跨行业共享的特征，其优势在于：\n\n**分散化（去中心化）：**基于分布式账本进行使用和存储，避免了身份数据被单一的中心化的权威机构所控制。\n\n**防篡改：**基于区块链的不可篡改特性，身份数据也将难以篡改。\n\n**控制权回到用户手中：**用户掌握身份数据的控制权，是自我主权身份的特点和要求。\n\n**安全性：**除了用户行为之外，区块链分类账上的去中心化系统通过先进的加密和密码学本质上是安全的。\n\n在现实世界中，身份是一个社会能否良好运转的不可或缺的一部分。护照帮助政府用于识别公民，驾驶执照允许公民合法上路，大学学位则代表了资质授予等。同样，DID将促成更高价值的互联网经济活动。\n\n下面，我们重点介绍DID可以解决的一些当前Web3的痛点。\n\n**1、NFTs——身份与真实性**\n\n诈骗和抄袭问题也困扰着艺术家或创作者。例如，Marvel超级英雄故事的设计者，数字艺术家Derek Laufman看到他的作品在他不知情的情况下在NFT平台Rarible上被拍卖。类似这样的故事很常见。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BUAwEhR8Akgp7v6-Cv90z.png?height=210&width=640)\n\n而DID基础架构可以解决这个问题。应用程序可以基于DID构建，以允许创建者可以证明这一NFT是由他们创建的。买家和卖家也将能够验证数字艺术品的出处。DID还可以强化艺术家和社区之间的纽带，例如将NFT所有权限制在社区成员中，以此限制黄牛的投机行为，或向特定持有者提供独享NFT内容。\n\n更广泛地说，NFT可以作为去中心化身份的一个锚点。现在的一些用户不仅仅通过用户名来展示自己，NFT形象也是重要体现。例如，Manifold联合创始人 @richerd说自己曾经拒绝了950万美元的加密朋克NFT报价，因为他将加密朋克视为自己的身份和品牌。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rfXEAcPHV3NQDwqYoPI4f.png?height=431&width=640)\n\n**2、解锁DeFi的下一阶段**\n\n到目前为止，抵押借贷一直是DeFi增长的支柱。但由于加密金融协议旨在完全无需信任和许可，因此它们通常需要超额抵押。\n\n例如，MakerDAO上的ETH贷款要求抵押率在130-170%之间。这推动了去年DeFi的增长，但抵押品的要求将限制大多数希望利用杠杆的加密货币交易者。对于大多数人来说，他们想借钱的原因是他们还没有他们需要的钱。\n\n降低或完全取消抵押要求是将DeFi引入大规模采用的关键。DID层可以为“链上”信用评分，为用户提供基于信用的贷款。此外，由于用户直接控制自身的信用评分，可以更好地监控和调整自身的借贷行为。因此，DID提供了进一步民主化去中心化金融系统的机会。\n\n此外，为金融应用程序提供强大的身份验证层可以解决DeFi中当前的其他问题，例如：\n\n1）通过对实际成员进行身份验证来减少机器人稀释空投事件的可能来改善代币空投的公平分配。\n\n2）使用DID限制对DeFi池的访问，以减少垃圾邮件/女巫攻击。\n\n3）指引可以信任的参与者以正和游戏方式行事，引导用户穿越以太坊的黑暗森林。\n\n**3、去中心化自治组织 (DAOs)**\n\nDAOs通常使用基于代币的治理来进行投票、治理或判定优先级。这通常是有道理的——大型代币持有者在游戏中的利益最重——但它可能排除或取消没有大量资本的活跃贡献者的优先级。尽管成员可以在DAO中建立自己的声誉，但他们可能需要在新的环境中从头开始建立信誉。\n\nDID可以在多个DAO中维护用户的声誉。将凭证从一个DAO移植到另一个DAO，从而避免了积极的贡献者从零开始的无意义消耗。此外，在其他Web3应用方向，例如参与Gitcoin、向Mirror发布或向Radicle贡献代码，可以进一步帮助DAO找到合格的贡献者与参与者。\n\n**三 、去中心化身份生态系统**\n\nDID生态系统可以分为多层，其上的每一层都建立在底层的协议之上。DIF的4层去中心化身份模型如下图所示。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RPjxUN-gfpGokCTLquDZQ.png?height=494&width=640)\n\n**第 1 层：标识符和标准**\n\n标准、标识符和命名空间创建公共信任层，确保标准化、可移植性和互通性。它们还允许网络注册和管理DID方法，为开发人员和用户提供网络ID系统的规则。\n\n万维网联盟（W3C）和去中心化身份基金会（DIF）是这一层的关键参与者，也是生态系统的基石。它充当开发、讨论和管理为DID堆栈创建活动以及维护可互通和开放的生态系统活动的中心。\n\n**第 2 层：基础设施**\n\n基础设施和代理框架允许应用程序和可验证的数据注册表之间彼此直接交互。这些解决方案包括通信、存储和密钥管理。我们将Ceramic和ENS列为构建DID基础设施的前沿项目（尽管ENS的分类可能存在争议，但我们将其置于基础设施层，因为我们预计未来将在ENS之上构建凭证和应用程序）。\n\n**第 3 层：凭证**\n\n凭证必须有管理、更新和交换。这一层旨在解决DID如何协调控制证明和进行身份验证，也包括在不同身份之间安全地传递数据。\n\nBrightID是该领域的一个著名项目。这是一个拥有超过30,000名用户的社交身份网络，允许人们向应用程序证明他们没有使用多个帐户，从而最大限度地减少女巫攻击的机会。\n\n**第 4 层：应用程序、钱包和产品**\n\n这一层可能是读者最熟悉的，旨在为消费者提供真实的使用价值。一些项目，如Goldfinch（无抵押贷款），使用专有的唯一实体验证方式，但仍希望在成熟时利用DID解决方案。相比之下，其他应用程序已经利用了现有的DID技术，例如TrueFi（具有链上信用评分的无抵押贷款）、Gitcoin（公共产品资金）和Ethsign（去中心化电子协议）。\n\n**四 W3C的DID标准**\n\nW3C标准的DID系统主要包括以下层次要素：\n\n**基础层：**DID规范\n\nDID标识符（Identifier）\n\nDID文档（Document）\n\n**应用层：**可验证声明\n\n可验证声明（Verifiable Claims 或 Verifiable Credentials，简称VC。\n\n**1. DID 规范**\n\n1）DID标识符，是一个全局唯一的表示你身份的东西，就像你的身份证号码一样。其形式大致如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MYOvCtTnkpf3G0zi_T7h3.png?height=121&width=522)\n\nDID示例：did:eth:123456789abcdefg\n\nDID标识符不容易记忆。根据Zooko三角形理论，没有任何标识符能够同时实现易记忆、安全、去中心化。在这里，W3C的DID取了后两者。\n\nDID Infrastructure是一个全局键值对数据库，这个数据库要么是某个DID兼容的区块链，要么是某个DID兼容的分布式账本，或者是某个DID兼容的去中心化网络（其实这个数据库的位置就是DID标识符中的example字段，目前已经有非常多的合法地址）。在这个数据库中，DID标识符是键，而DID文档是值。\n\n2）DID文档是一个JSON-LD Object，包括6个部分（都是optional的）：\n\n1、DID标识符。\n\n2、一个加密材料的集合。比如公钥。\n\n3、一个加密协议的集合。\n\n4、一个服务端点的集合。\n\n5、时间戳。\n\n6、一个可选的JSON-LD签名。用来证明这个DID文档是合法的。\n\n文档内容示例：\n\n{\n\n\"@context\": \"https://w3id.org/did/v1\",\n\n\"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n\"authentication\": \\[{\n\n// used to authenticate as did:...fghi\n\n\"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1\",\n\n\"type\": \"RsaVerificationKey2018\",\n\n\"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n\"publicKeyPem\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\\\\r\\\\n\"\n\n}\\],\n\n\"service\": \\[{\n\n// used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID\n\n\"id\":\"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs\",\n\n\"type\": \"VerifiableCredentialService\",\n\n\"serviceEndpoint\": \"https://example.com/vc/\"\n\n}\\]\n\n}\n\n这里需要注意的是，DID文档中没有任何和你个人真实信息相关的内容，比如你的真实姓名、地址、手机号等。因此光靠DID规范是无法验证一个人的身份的，必须要靠DID应用层中的VC。\n\n**2. 可验证声明**\n\nW3C认为前面的DID规范是基础，而把可验证声明视作是next higher layer，并认为这一层才是建立DID整个体系的价值所在。因为在这个应用层中，DID既可以用来标识个体的身份、也可以用来标识组织的身份，甚至标识物品的身份。\n\n可验证声明类似于数字签名，要实现数字签名，需要有PKI体系，可验证声明也是一样，需要用一套系统来支持它。在可验证声明系统中，有以下几种参与者：\n\n**发行者：**拥有用户数据并能开具可验证声明的实体，如政府、银行、大学等机构和组织。\n\n**验证者**：接受可验证声明并进行验证，由此可以提供给出示可验证声明者某种类型的服务。\n\n**持有者：**向发行者请求、收到、持有可验证声明的实体。向验证者出示可验证声明。开具的可验证声明可以放在可验证声明钱包里，方便以后再次使用。\n\n**标识符注册机构：**维护去中心化身份数据库，如某条区块链、分布式账本。\n\n**免责声明：本文分享内容仅作学习交流，不构成任何投资建议。**", "timestamp": 1654657845, "digest": "F3AroTTo1cgxnr8NtyJXRfP43JisZ4zjvtW2sbkP270", "contributor": "0x251C9aBcF97B5135C7eB68D1B0E0f0C8D2e48ea2"}
{"id": "CqO4i24lsBnO2vfTh6clSGQPK_nFF6X_nJZMrtkEXDI", "title": "Earnest Money", "body": "## What Is Earnest Money?\n\nEarnest money is a deposit made to a seller that represents a buyer's good faith to buy a home. The money gives the buyer extra time to get financing and conduct the title search, property appraisal, and inspections before closing. In many ways, earnest money can be considered a deposit on a home, an escrow deposit, or [good faith money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodfaithmoney.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Earnest money is essentially a deposit a buyer makes on a home they want to purchase.\n* A contract is written up during the exchange of the earnest money that outlines the conditions for refunding the amount.\n* Earnest money deposits can be anywhere from 1–10% of the sales price, depending mostly on market interest.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:12\n\n#### Earnest Money\n\n## Understanding Earnest Money\n\nIn most cases, earnest money is delivered when the sales contract or purchase agreement is signed, but it can also be attached to the offer. Once deposited, the funds are typically held in an [escrow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp) account until closing, at which time the deposit is applied to the buyer's down payment and closing costs.\n\nWhen a buyer decides to purchase a home from a seller, both parties enter into a contract. The contract doesn't obligate the buyer to purchase the home, because reports from the [home appraisal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp) and inspection may later reveal problems with the house. The contract does, however, ensure the seller takes the house off the market while it's inspected and appraised. To prove the buyer's offer to purchase the property is made in good faith, the buyer makes an earnest money deposit (EMD).\n\nThe buyer might be able to reclaim the earnest money deposit if something that was specified ahead of time in the contract goes wrong. For instance, the earnest money would be returned if the house doesn't appraise for the sales price or the inspection reveals a serious defect—provided these contingencies are listed in the contract.\n\nHowever, earnest money isn't always refundable. For example, the seller gets to keep the earnest money if the buyer decides not to go through with the home purchase for [contingencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contingency.asp) not listed in the contract or if the buyer fails to meet the timeline outlined in the contract. The buyer forfeits the earnest money deposit if they simply have a change of heart and decide not to buy. \n\nEarnest money is always returned to the buyer if the seller terminates the deal.\n\nWhile the buyer and seller can negotiate the earnest money deposit, it often ranges between 1% and 2% of the home's purchase price, depending on the market. In hot housing markets, the earnest money deposit might range between 5% and 10% of a property's sale price.\n\nWhile the earnest money deposit is often a percentage of the sales price, some sellers prefer a fixed amount, such as $5,000 or $10,000. Of course, the higher the earnest money amount, the more serious the seller is likely to consider the buyer. Therefore, a buyer should offer a high enough earnest deposit to be accepted, but not one so high as to put extra money at risk.\n\nEarnest money is usually paid by certified check, personal check, or a wire transfer into a trust or escrow account that is held by a real estate brokerage, legal firm, or title company. The funds are held in the account until closing, when they are applied toward the buyer's down payment and closing costs. It's important to note that escrow accounts, like any other bank account, can earn interest. If the earnest funds in the escrow account earn interest of more than $600, the buyer must fill out tax [form W-9](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w9form.asp) with the IRS to receive the interest.1\n\nThose interested in learning more about earnest money may want to consider enrolling in one of the [best online real estate schools](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-real-estate-schools-4844110).\n\nProspective buyers forfeit their earnest money if they decide to back out of a purchase.\n\n## Protecting Your Earnest Money Deposit\n\nProspective buyers can do several things to protect their earnest money deposits.\n\n* **Make sure contingencies for financing and inspections are included in the contract.** Without these, the deposit could be forfeited if the buyer can't get financing or a serious defect is found during the inspection.\n* **Read, understand, and abide by the terms of the contract.** For example, if the contract states the home inspection must be completed by a certain date, the buyer must meet that deadline or risk losing the deposit—and the house.\n* **Make sure the deposit is handled appropriately.** The deposit should be payable to a reputable third party, such as a well-known real estate brokerage, escrow company, title company, or legal firm (never give the deposit directly to the seller). Buyers should verify the funds will be held in an escrow account and always obtain a receipt. \n\n## Example of Earnest Money\n\nSuppose Tom wants to buy a home worth $100,000 from Joy. To facilitate the transaction, the broker arranges to deposit $10,000 as a deposit in an escrow account. The terms of the subsequent agreement signed by both parties state that Joy, who is currently living in the home, will move out of it within the next six months.\n\nBut she is unable to find another place of residence by moving day. As a result, Tom cancels the transaction and gets his deposit money back. The deposit money has earned interest of $500 from the escrow account during this time period. Since the amount is less than $600, Tom is not required to fill out an IRS form to retrieve the amount.1\n\n## What Is Earnest Money Used for?\n\nIn real estate, earnest money is effectively a deposit to buy a home. Usually, it ranges between 1-10% of the home’s sale price. While earnest money doesn’t obligate a buyer to purchase a home, it does require the seller to take the property off of the market during the appraisal process. Earnest money is deposited to represent good faith in purchasing the home.\n\n## Does Earnest Money Get Returned?\n\nEarnest money gets returned if something goes awry during the appraisal that was predetermined in the contract. This could include an appraisal price that is lower than the sale price, or if there is a significant flaw with the house. Importantly, though, earnest money may not be returned if the flaw was not predetermined in the contract or if the buyer decides not to purchase the house during an agreed-upon time period. \n\n## How Can Earnest Money Be Protected?\n\nTo protect an earnest money deposit, prospective buyers can follow a number of precautionary steps. First, buyers can ensure that contingencies apply to defects, financing, and inspections. This protects the deposit from being forfeited in the case that a major flaw is discovered, or that financing is not secured. Second, carefully read and follow the terms of the contract. In some cases, the contract will indicate a certain date by which the inspection must be made. To prevent forfeiture, the buyer should abide by these terms accordingly. Finally, ensure the deposit is handled adequately, which means that the buyer should work with a reputable broker, title firm, escrow company, or legal firm. ", "timestamp": 1654657772, "digest": "WXA_h08ghm3yq40A0ZdyaINgoL51ETnT1oTtVR5rERI", "contributor": "0x7A74d8b2640b9daF687553f4Ec6F56aBAbE10828"}
{"id": "Cxv6tAXN9H0Yyfub4m9XN6fAYrVuBmebsmDBKaqvO-M", "title": "Goods and Services Tax (GST)", "body": "## What Is the Goods and Services Tax (GST)?\n\nThe goods and services tax (GST) is a value-added tax levied on most goods and services sold for [domestic consumption](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp). The GST is paid by consumers, but it is remitted to the government by the businesses selling the goods and services.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The goods and services tax (GST) is a tax on goods and services sold domestically for consumption.\n* The tax is included in the final price and paid by consumers at point of sale and passed to the government by the seller.\n* The GST is a common tax used by the majority of countries globally.\n* The GST is usually taxed as a single rate across a nation.\n\n## Understanding the Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nThe goods and services tax (GST) is an [indirect federal sales tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indirecttax.asp) that is applied to the cost of certain goods and services. The business adds the GST to the price of the product, and a customer who buys the product pays the sales price inclusive of the GST. The GST portion is collected by the business or seller and forwarded to the government. It is also referred to as [Value-Added Tax (VAT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp) in some countries.\n\n## How the Goods and Services Tax (GST) System Works\n\nMost countries with a GST have a single unified GST system, which means that a single tax rate is applied throughout the country. A country with a unified GST platform merges central taxes (e.g., sales tax, excise duty tax, and service tax) with state-level taxes (e.g., entertainment tax, entry tax, [transfer tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfertax.asp), [sin tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sin_tax.asp), and luxury tax) and collects them as one single tax. These countries tax virtually everything at a single rate.\n\n## Dual Goods and Services Tax (GST) Structures\n\nOnly a handful of countries, such as Canada and Brazil, have a dual GST structure.1 Compared to a unified GST economy where tax is collected by the federal government and then distributed to the states, in a dual system, the federal GST is applied in addition to the state sales tax. In Canada, for example, the federal government levies a 5% tax and some provinces/states also [levy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/levy.asp) a provincial state tax (PST), which varies from 8% to 10%.23 In this case, a consumer's receipt will clearly have the GST and PST rate that was applied to their purchase value.\n\nMore recently, the GST and PST have been combined in some provinces into a single tax known as the [Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harmonized-sales-tax.asp). Prince Edward Island was the first to adopt the HST in 2013, combining its federal and provincial sales taxes into a single tax.4 Since then, several other provinces have followed suit, including New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Ontario.2 \n\n## Which Countries Collect the Goods and Services Tax (GST)?\n\nFrance was the first country to implement the GST in 1954; since then, an estimated 140 countries have adopted this tax system in some form or another.5 Some of the countries with a GST include Canada, Vietnam, Australia, Singapore, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Nigeria, Brazil, and India.6\n\n## India's Adoption of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nIndia established a dual GST structure in 2017, which was the biggest reform in the country's tax structure in decades.7 The main objective of incorporating the GST was to eliminate tax on tax, or [double taxation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double_taxation.asp), which cascades from the manufacturing level to the consumption level.8\n\nFor example, a manufacturer that makes notebooks obtains the [raw materials](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp) for, say, Rs. 10, which includes a 10% tax. This means that they pay Rs. 1 in tax for Rs. 9 worth of materials. In the process of manufacturing the notebook, the manufacturer adds value to the original materials of Rs. 5, for a total value of Rs. 10 + Rs. 5 = Rs. 15. The 10% tax due on the finished good will be Rs. 1.50. Under a GST system, the previous tax paid can be applied against this additional tax to bring the effective tax rate to Rs. 1.50 – Rs. 1.00 = Rs. 0.50.\n\nIn turn, the wholesaler purchases the notebook for Rs. 15 and sells it to the retailer at a Rs. 2.50[ markup](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/markup.asp) value for Rs. 17.50. The 10% tax on the gross value of the good will be Rs. 1.75, which the wholesaler can apply against the tax on the original cost price from the manufacturer (i.e., Rs. 15). The wholesaler's effective tax rate will, thus, be Rs. 1.75 – Rs. 1.50 = Rs. 0.25.\n\nSimilarly, if the retailer's [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp) is Rs. 1.50, his effective tax rate will be (10% x Rs. 19) – Rs. 1.75 = Rs. 0.15. Total tax that [cascades](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cascade-tax.asp) from manufacturer to retailer will be Rs. 1 + Rs. 0.50 + Rs. 0.25 + Rs. 0.15 = Rs. 1.90.\n\nIndia has, since launching the GST on July 1, 2017, implemented the following tax rates:9 \n\n* A 0% tax rate applied to certain foods, books, newspapers, homespun cotton cloth, and hotel services.\n* A rate of 0.25% applied to cut and semi-polished stones.\n* A 5% tax on household necessities such as sugar, spices, tea, and coffee.\n* A 12% tax on computers and processed food.\n* An 18% tax on hair oil, toothpaste, soap, and industrial intermediaries.\n* The final bracket, taxing goods at 28%, applies to luxury products, including refrigerators, ceramic tiles, cigarettes, cars, and motorcycles.\n\nThe previous system with no GST implies that tax is paid on the value of goods and margin at every stage of the production process. This would translate to a higher amount of total taxes paid, which is carried down to the end consumer in the form of higher costs for goods and services. The implementation of the GST system in India is, therefore, a measure that is used to reduce [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) in the long run, as prices for goods will be lower.", "timestamp": 1654657441, "digest": "coeKSkxDZ53sCzaAHFvlW29qQYswfKi-8hQc2t1g3_4", "contributor": "0x23Ef48bb2d0F3B2139572AC1Ea1ba26BCc64dF3a"}

{"id": "fzKhlBx_Ss_2eFjvvLuIjBwLiYsbAkqAZ-IDT6mRShE", "title": "How does the Wormhole bridge work?", "body": "**So many chains, so little noise!**\n\nA lot of chains have spun up in the last three years, especially built on different infrastructures like EVM like Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, or Substrate-based chains like Polkadot, Cosmos-SDK chains like Terra and BNB. This makes it incredibly difficult to communicate between chains. This communication entails not just token transfers but also more generic messaging for applications like cross-chain voting or playing games where you could own assets on one chain and make your moves on another one. \n\nThis is where Wormhole comes in. From their docs,\n\n> *Wormhole is a generic message passing protocol that connects to multiple chains including Ethereum, Solana, Terra, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Oasis, and Fantom.*\n\nThis serves us perfectly. Wormhole operates with the help of a network of nodes called guardians which signs and verifies transactions on the origin chain and with relayers to relay the message to the target chain. More details here:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FsKgiki6H6tLUWmq83DVC.jpg?height=935&width=1571)\n\n* Wormhole has core bridge contracts deployed on all chains (published list available [here](https://docs.wormholenetwork.com/wormhole/contracts)). They implement `emitVAA()` and `verifyVAA()` functions. VAA or Verifiable Action Approval is a struct containing your message payload along with guardian signatures. `emitVAA` reads and publishes messages to the “mempool” of VAAs and `verifyVAA` takes VAA and matches the guardian signatures to make sure the proof is valid. This is the VAA payload:\n\n```\n// head\n\nbyte        version                  // VAA Version\nu32         guardian_set_index       // Indicates which guardian set is signing\nu8          len_signatures           // Number of signatures stored[][66]byte    signatures       // Collection of ecdsa signatures\n\n// body\n\nu32         timestamp\nu32         nonce\nu16         emitter_chain\n[32]byte    emitter_address\nu64         sequence\nu8          consistency_level\n[]byte      payload\n```\n\n* Once you send the transactions to the wormhole, each and every guardian will confirm and sign the payload in isolation and these signatures get collectively stored in `stored[][66]byte`. This is similar to users who independently sign transactions on a Gnosis multi-sig wallet. There are only [19 guardians](https://wormholenetwork.com/network/) on the network and most of these are Solana validators.\n* Upon reaching 2/3rd majority of guardian signatures, the `emitVAA` the function gets triggered and the VAAs are ready to be picked up from the Wormhole network and submit it to the target chain. \n* On the target chain, the VAA is processed by the core receiving contract. You can manually go fetch your message from the guardian RPC and submit the VAA on the target chain. Usually, this burden is abstracted away from the user by the dapps built on top of the core Wormhole bridge. In a lot of cases, they use “relayer” which acts as an automation script. Relayers can be run in an untrusted environment and cannot forge VAAs as they aren’t running any cryptographic function and if they taper with the code it gets rejected at the target chain bridge contracts.\n\n#### Who pays for the gas fees, on which chain, and in which token?\n\nSince the transaction is settled on the target chain, gas fees should be paid there. If a user doesn’t have the native currency on the target chain, the bridge lets users pay a portion of the token being transferred via relayers. The relayers then cover the gas expenditure on the target chain. Oftentimes, dapps built on Wormhole will pay on the user’s behalf as meta-transactions to improve ease of use.\n\n#### What if the target chain has a longer finality period than the lifetime of this message-passing? \n\nIn this case, messages on the origin chain may get slashed by a fork. Wormhole attempts to fix this by allowing the message emitting contract on the origin chain to specify the waiting period before sending it to the wormhole guardian network. If you’re on Ethereum, you need to wait for 13 network confirmations before assuming immutability of your transaction and as a dapp builder, you can specify this number as you deploy your contracts.\n\n#### How does a lock/mint token bridge work with Wormhole?\n\nThe token is locked on the origin chain and its wrapped version is minted on the target chain. The origin chain emits a message saying the tokens have been locked in the following structure:\n\n```\nu8      payload_id = 1          Transfer\nu256    amount                  Amount of tokens being transferred.\nu8[32]  token_address           Address on the origin chain.\nu16     token_chain             Numeric ID for the origin chain.\nu8[32]  to                      Address on the destination chain.\nu16     to_chain                Numeric ID for the destination chain.\nu256    fee                     Portion of amount paid to a relayer.\n```\n\nThis event however doesn’t specify the implementation of how the tokens were locked. They could have been locked in a smart contract or in a custody, this is up to the implementation of the token bridge.\n\n#### Is having 19 guardians pose a centralization risk?\n\nYes. In comparison to trustless liquidity bridges like Connext or light client bridges like LayerZero or Gravity, Wormhole falls in the “External validators” category of bridges which makes it one of the riskier ones and prone to centralization risk especially because these 19 validators are also validators for the Solana network.\n\n#### What if you can’t trust the guardian network?\n\nThis is a valid concern. On Feb 2nd, a hacker was able to spook guardian signatures by calling an outdated version of the `Secp256k1` contract for the `verify_signatures` function on Solana, generating a fake `SignatureSet` and signing fraudulent VAA to drain 120k ETH on Ethereum, making WETH on Solana worthless. Read more about this hack [here](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1489044939732406275). Lock/mint token bridges like the Wormhole Portal essentially behave as massive escrow accounts and aren’t supported by the economic security of the connecting L1s. And operating on multiple chains, they have multiple points of failure. This paints them as big targets for being exploited by hackers.\n\n#### Example code\n\nThis is how a user interacts and the bridge user flows:\n\n* Say you’ve deployed your contract on Eth mainnet but you want to send a message to Solana. So, using the Wormhole SDK, you can wrap your address in `IWormhole` and use `_wormhole.publishMessage()` with:\n\n```\nimport \"./interfaces/IWormhole.sol\";\n\ncontract Messenger {\n\n    // Hardcode the Wormhole Core Bridge contract address\n    // In a real contract, we would set this in a constructor\n    address a = address(0xC89Ce4735882C9F0f0FE26686c53074E09B0D550);\n    IWormhole _wormhole = IWormhole(a);\n\n    function sendStr(bytes memory str, uint32 nonce) public returns         (uint64 sequence) {\n        sequence = _wormhole.publishMessage(nonce, str, 1);\n        return sequence;\n    }\n\n    function wormhole() public view returns (IWormhole) {\n        return _wormhole;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nToken transfer from Ethereum to Solana:\n\n```\n// Submit transaction\nconst receipt = await transferFromEth(\n  ETH_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS, // specified in the doc\n  signer, \n  tokenAddress, // WETH token address\n  amount,\n  CHAIN_ID_SOLANA, \n  recipientAddress // already attested address on solana\n);\n\n// signedVAA needs to be fetched\nconst { signedVAA } = await getSignedVAA(\n  WORMHOLE_RPC_HOST,\n  CHAIN_ID_ETH,\n  emitterAddress,\n  sequence\n);\n\n// post signVAA\nawait postVaaSolana(\n  connection,\n  wallet,\n  SOL_BRIDGE_ADDRESS,\n  payerAddress,\n  signedVAA\n);\n\n// redeem WETH on Solana\nconst transaction = await redeemOnSolana(\n  connection,\n  SOL_BRIDGE_ADDRESS,\n  SOL_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS,\n  payerAddress,\n  signedVAA,\n  isSolanaNative,\n  mintAddress\n);\n```\n\n#### Unanswered questions\n\n* How does Wormhole handle multiple chains talking to each other at the same time? If chain A sends a message to chain B and also sends a different message to chain C which then sends it to chain B, which version will be considered to be accurate?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NnwHv3i7ObNFq4XVs-3J4.jpg?height=410&width=914)\n\n* Can Wormhole mitigate its centralization factor? Is there a way to get the counterparty validator set on either side of the bridge to behave as additional members of the guardian network?\n*  How does Wormhole deal with interactions between deterministic vs probabilistic consensus models?\n\n#### Other resources\n\n[Wormhole docs](https://docs.wormholenetwork.com/wormhole/)\n\n[Blockchain bridges](http://Blockchain%20bridges) by [Dmitriy Berenzon](https://medium.com/@dberenzon?source=post_page-----5db6afac44f8--------------------------------)\n\n[Validator vs Relayer](https://medium.com/teleportdao/bridges-validator-vs-relay-b8836b4b4cf0)\n\nThanks for reading and following me on Twitter [@auroraByKunal](https://twitter.com/auroraByKunal).

{"id": "gXEPbzinAfGzN3pNnwWq6PNcuyd6qLNpI1A3esYJOH8", "title": "Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio", "body": "## What Is the Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio?\n\nThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate [a company's financial leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-considered-good-net-debttoequity-ratio.asp) and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its [shareholder equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp). The D/E ratio is an important metric used in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds. More specifically, it reflects the ability of shareholder equity to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn. The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of [gearing ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gearingratio.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a company’s total liabilities to its shareholder equity and can be used to evaluate how much leverage a company is using.\n* Higher-leverage ratios tend to indicate a company or stock with higher risk to shareholders.\n* However, the D/E ratio is difficult to compare across industry groups where ideal amounts of debt will vary.\n* Investors will often modify the D/E ratio to focus on long-term debt only because the risks associated with long-term liabilities are different than short-term debt and payables.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 28 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:28\n\n#### The Debt To Equity Ratio\n\n## Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio Formula and Calculation\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Debt/Equity} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Total Liabilities} }{ \\\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity} } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=Total Shareholders’ EquityTotal Liabilities​​\n\nThe information needed for the D/E ratio is on a company's [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp). The balance sheet requires total shareholder equity to equal assets minus liabilities, which is a rearranged version of the balance sheet equation:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Assets} = \\\\text{Liabilities} + \\\\text{Shareholder Equity} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Assets=Liabilities+Shareholder Equity​\n\nThese balance sheet categories may contain individual accounts that would not normally be considered “debt” or “equity” in the traditional sense of a loan or the book value of an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by [retained earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp)/losses, intangible assets, and [pension plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp) adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand a company’s true leverage.\n\nBecause of the ambiguity of some of the accounts in the primary balance sheet categories, analysts and investors will often modify the D/E ratio to be more useful and easier to compare between different stocks. Analysis of the D/E ratio can also be improved by including short-term [leverage ratios](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverageratio.asp), profit performance, and growth expectations.\n\nMelissa Ling {Copyright} Investopedia, 2019. \n\n### How to Calculate the D/E Ratio in Excel\n\nBusiness owners use a variety of software to track D/E ratios and other financial metrics. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as the D/E ratio and [debt ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtratio.asp).1 However, even the amateur trader may want to calculate a company's D/E ratio when evaluating a potential investment opportunity, and it can be calculated without the aid of templates.\n\n## What Does the Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio Tell You?\n\nGiven that the D/E ratio measures a company’s debt relative to the value of its net assets, it is most often used to gauge the extent to which a company is taking on [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp) as a means of leveraging its [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). A high D/E ratio is often associated with high risk; it means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt.\n\nIf a lot of debt is used to finance growth, a company could potentially generate more [earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) than it would have without that [financing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp). If leverage increases earnings by a greater amount than the debt’s cost (interest), then shareholders should expect to benefit. However, if the cost of debt financing outweighs the increased income generated, share values may decline. The cost of debt can vary with market conditions. Thus, unprofitable borrowing may not be apparent at first.\n\nChanges in [long-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermdebt.asp) and assets tend to have the greatest impact on the D/E ratio because they tend to be larger accounts compared to [short-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp) and short-term assets. If investors want to evaluate a company’s short-term leverage and its ability to meet debt obligations that must be paid over a year or less, they can use other ratios.\n\nFor example, an investor who needs to compare a company’s short-term liquidity or solvency will use the [cash ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-ratio.asp):\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Cash Ratio} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Cash} + \\\\text{Marketable Securities} }{ \\\\text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Cash Ratio=Short-Term Liabilities Cash+Marketable Securities​​\n\nor the [current ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp):\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Current Ratio} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Short-Term Assets} }{ \\\\text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Current Ratio=Short-Term Liabilities Short-Term Assets​​\n\ninstead of a long-term measure of leverage such as the D/E ratio.\n\n## Modifications to the Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio\n\nThe [shareholders' equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp) portion of the balance sheet is equal to the total value of assets minus liabilities, but that isn’t the same thing as assets minus the debt associated with those assets. A common approach to resolving this issue is to modify the D/E ratio into the long-term D/E ratio. An approach like this helps an analyst focus on important risks.\n\nShort-term debt is still part of the overall [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) of a company, but because these liabilities will be paid in a year or less, they aren’t as risky. For example, imagine a company with $1 million in short-term payables (wages, [accounts payable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp), and notes, etc.) and $500,000 in long-term debt, compared to a company with $500,000 in short-term payables and $1 million in long-term debt. If both companies have $1.5 million in shareholder equity, then they both have a D/E ratio of 1.00. On the surface, the risk from leverage is identical, but in reality, the second company is riskier.\n\nAs a rule, short-term debt tends to be cheaper than long-term debt, and it is less sensitive to shifting [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp), meaning the second company’s interest expense and [cost of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp) are higher. If interest rates fall, long-term debt will need to be refinanced, which can further increase costs. Rising interest rates would seem to favor the company with more long-term debt, but if the debt can be redeemed by bondholders it could still be a disadvantage.\n\n## The Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio for Personal Finances\n\nThe D/E ratio can apply to [personal financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-financial-statement.asp) as well, in which case it is also known as the personal D/E ratio. Here, “equity” refers to the difference between the total value of an individual’s assets and the total value of their debt or liabilities. The formula for the personal D/E ratio is represented as:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Debt/Equity} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Total Personal Liabilities} }{ \\\\text{Personal Assets} - \\\\text{Liabilities} } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=Personal Assets−LiabilitiesTotal Personal Liabilities​​\n\nThe personal D/E ratio is often used when an individual or small business is applying for a [loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp). Lenders use the D/E to evaluate how likely it would be that the borrower is able to continue making loan payments if their income was temporarily disrupted.\n\nFor example, a prospective mortgage borrower who is out of a job for a few months is more likely to be able to continue making payments if they have more assets than debt. This is also true for an individual applying for a small business loan or line of credit. If the business owner has a good personal D/E ratio, it is more likely that they can continue making loan payments while their business is growing.\n\n## Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio vs. the Gearing Ratio\n\nGearing ratios constitute a broad category of financial ratios, of which the D/E ratio is the best example. \"Gearing\" simply refers to financial leverage.\n\nGearing ratios focus more heavily on the concept of leverage than other ratios used in accounting or investment analysis. This conceptual focus prevents gearing ratios from being precisely calculated or interpreted with uniformity. The underlying principle generally assumes that some leverage is good, but too much places an organization at risk.\n\nAt a fundamental level, gearing is sometimes differentiated from leverage. Leverage refers to the amount of debt incurred for the purpose of investing and obtaining a higher return, while gearing refers to debt along with total equity—or an expression of the percentage of company funding through borrowing. This difference is embodied in the difference between the debt ratio and the D/E ratio.\n\nThe real use of debt/equity is comparing the ratio for firms in the same industry—if a company's ratio varies significantly from its competitors' ratios, that could raise a red flag.\n\n## Limitations of the Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio\n\nWhen using the D/E ratio, it is very important to consider the industry in which the company operates. Because different industries have different capital needs and growth rates, a relatively high D/E ratio may be common in one industry, while a relatively low D/E may be common in another.\n\nUtility stocks often have a very high D/E ratio compared to market averages. A utility grows slowly but is usually able to maintain a steady income stream, which allows these companies to borrow very cheaply. High-leverage ratios in slow-growth industries with stable income represent an efficient use of capital. The [consumer staples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerstaples.asp) or consumer non-cyclical sector tends to also have a high D/E ratio because these companies can borrow cheaply and have a relatively stable income.2\n\nAnalysts are not always consistent about what is defined as debt. For example, [preferred stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) is sometimes considered equity, but the preferred dividend, par value, and liquidation rights make this kind of equity look a lot more like debt.\n\nIncluding preferred stock in total debt will increase the D/E ratio and make a company look riskier. Including preferred stock in the equity portion of the D/E ratio will increase the denominator and lower the ratio. It can be a big issue for companies such as [real estate investment trusts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) (REITs) when preferred stock is included in the D/E ratio.\n\n## Examples of the Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio\n\nAt the end of 2017, Apache Corporation (APA) had total liabilities of $13.1 billion, total shareholder equity of $8.79 billion, and a D/E ratio of 1.49.34 ConocoPhillips (COP) had total liabilities of $42.56 billion, total shareholder equity of $30.8 billion, and a D/E ratio of 1.38 at the end of 2017:5\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{APA} = \\\\frac{ \\\\$13.1 }{ \\\\$8.79 } = 1.49 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​APA=$8.79$13.1​=1.49​\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{COP} = \\\\frac{ \\\\$42.56 }{ \\\\$30.80 } = 1.38 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​COP=$30.80$42.56​=1.38​\n\nOn the surface, it appears that APA’s higher-leverage ratio indicates higher risk. However, this may be too generalized to be helpful at this stage, and further investigation would be needed.\n\nWe can also see how reclassifying preferred equity can change the D/E ratio in the following example, in which it is assumed that a company has $500,000 in preferred stock, $1 million in total debt (excluding preferred stock), and $1.2 million in total shareholder equity (excluding preferred stock).\n\nThe D/E ratio with preferred stock as part of total liabilities would be as follows:\n\n* D/E = ($1 million + $500,000) / $1.2 million = 1.25\n\nThe D/E ratio with preferred stock as part of shareholder equity would be:\n\n* D/E = $1 million / ($1.25 million + $500,000) = 0.57\n\nOther financial accounts, such as [unearned income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unearnedincome.asp), will be classified as debt and can distort the D/E ratio. Imagine a company with a prepaid contract to construct a building for $1 million. The work is not complete, so the $1 million is considered a liability. If this amount is included in the D/E calculation, the numerator will be increased by $1 million.\n\n## What Is a Good Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio?\n\nWhat counts as a “good” debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio will depend on the nature of the business and its industry. Generally speaking, a D/E ratio below 1.0 would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would be considered risky.\n\nSome industries, such as banking, are known for having much higher D/E ratios than others. Note that a D/E ratio that is too low may actually be a negative signal, indicating that the firm is not taking advantage of debt financing to expand and grow.\n\n## What Does a Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio of 1.5 Indicate?\n\nA debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5 would indicate that the company in question has $1.50 of debt for every $1 of equity. To illustrate, suppose the company had assets of $2 million and liabilities of $1.2 million. Because equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, the company’s equity would be $800,000. Its D/E ratio would therefore be $1.2 million divided by $800,000, or 1.5.\n\n## What Does It Mean for D/E to Be Negative?\n\nIf a company has a negative D/E ratio, this means that the company has negative shareholder equity. In other words, it means that the company has more liabilities than assets. In most cases, this is considered a very risky sign, indicating that the company may be at risk of bankruptcy. For instance, if the company in our earlier example had liabilities of $2.5 million, its D/E ratio would be -5.\n\n## What Industries Have High D/E Ratios?\n\nIn the banking and financial services sector, a relatively high D/E ratio is commonplace. Banks carry higher amounts of debt because they own substantial [fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp) in the form of branch networks. Other industries that commonly show a relatively higher ratio are capital-intensive industries, such as the airline industry or large manufacturing companies, which utilize a high level of debt financing as a common practice.\n\n## How Can the D/E Ratio Be Used to Measure a Company's Riskiness?\n\nA higher D/E ratio may make it harder for a company to obtain financing in the future. This means that the firm may have a harder time servicing its existing debts. Very high D/Es can be indicative of a credit crisis in the future, including defaulting on loans or bonds, or even bankruptcy.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuoQm8lKqBviRoM9yCcVKOxbKwk0IBCbQNWzsIAIAV181BkFlFauq9BFfvAs557eVCmu996dnFmWEZnCZuWLpJeBpCx7KeAw6cThmWfBF9pq-C5XMjhmH0Cd-daLzUgPqPHE9os6wIiG0YfOcJ19zEoN8hk5d3l1j1iJNHWMJQ32P4iiFPaLcp-RaVN0UUNc3CJdv3aTGl0yv_H_iKfjwofxlyNKhCvPWIKF4OU9kYAHTkmO5BQtG9HsLWe2ixGKzLsEY5hNhX9oBZyfQURFyraO7rNtCbnUMNPtvhsguYc2o5DSKLs7g9qFwNe4MxcgLHpYOs3WtKHiVpUQMETcd0DvKStYhoZs3p027emupUt91c&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEdq5AylH1ltEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuoQm8lKqBviRoM9yCcVKOxbKwk0IBCbQNWzsIAIAV181BkFlFauq9BFfvAs557eVCmu996dnFmWEZnCZuWLpJeBpCx7KeAw6cThmWfBF9pq-C5XMjhmH0Cd-daLzUgPqPHE9os6wIiG0YfOcJ19zEoN8hk5d3l1j1iJNHWMJQ32P4iiFPaLcp-RaVN0UUNc3CJdv3aTGl0yv_H_iKfjwofxlyNKhCvPWIKF4OU9kYAHTkmO5BQtG9HsLWe2ixGKzLsEY5hNhX9oBZyfQURFyraO7rNtCbnUMNPtvhsguYc2o5DSKLs7g9qFwNe4MxcgLHpYOs3WtKHiVpUQMETcd0DvKStYhoZs3p027emupUt91c&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEdq5AylH1ltEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

In delivered-at-place agreements, the buyer is responsible for paying [import duties](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import-duty.asp) and any applicable taxes, including clearance and local taxes, once the shipment has arrived at the specified destination.\n\nThe phrase \"delivered-at-place\" was introduced in the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) eighth publication of its [Incoterms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incoterms.asp)—international commercial terms—in 2010.1﻿\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Delivered-at-place (DAP) is an international trade term used to describe a deal in which a seller agrees to pay all costs and suffer any potential losses of moving goods sold to a specific location.\n* Delivered-at-place simply means that the seller takes on all the risks and costs of delivering goods to an agreed-upon location.\n* Delivered-at-place is an international trade term that was introduced in the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) eighth publication of its Incoterms.\n\n## How Delivered-at-Place (DAP) Works\n\nDelivered-at-place simply means that the seller takes on all the risks and costs of delivering goods to an agreed-upon location. This means the seller is responsible for everything, including packaging, documentation, export approval, loading charges, and ultimate delivery. The buyer, in turn, takes over risk and responsibility as of the unloading of the goods and clearing them for import.\n\nA delivered-at-place agreement is applicable for any form, or combination of forms, of transportation and usually lists the point at which the buyer takes on financial responsibilities—for example, “Delivered-at-place, Port of Oakland.”\n\nWhen it was introduced in 2010, DAP replaced the term [Delivery Duty Unpaid (DDU)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delivereddutyunpaid.asp) and, while DDU may still be used colloquially, DAP is now the official term used in international trade.1﻿\n\nThe opposite of Delivered-at-place (DAP) is [Delivered Duty Paid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delivery-duty-paid.asp), which indicates that the seller must cover duties, import clearance, and any taxes.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nThe main driver behind the ICC and the Incoterms is the need for a clear understanding of counter-party responsibilities in international contracts, particularly when it comes to who ships what to where. With the ICC issuing concrete definitions, contracts can refer to the Incoterms, and the signing parties have a shared understanding of responsibilities. The Incoterms are updated in order to simplify usages and remove obsolete terms. Delivered-at-place was one of those simplifications, as the definition applies regardless of the method of transport.\n\n### \n\n*The ICC was founded in 1919 and has released eight updates of its international commercial terms since 1936.*\n\nEven with the clear guidelines for DAP arrangements, there are still situations that result in disputes, such as when the carrier of the goods incurs [demurrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demurrage.asp)—a charge for failing to unload in time—as a result of not receiving the proper clearance from one of the parties. In these cases, the fault usually lies with whichever party was amiss in providing timely documentation, but determining that can be difficult, as documentation requirements are defined by the national and local authorities controlling ports and vary from country to country. Indeed, international trade law can be complex even with the benefit of defined contract terms.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

This agreement includes paying for shipping costs, export and import duties, [insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp), and any other expenses incurred during shipping to an agreed-upon location in the buyer's country.1\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 32 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:32\n\n#### Delivery Duty Paid (DDP)\n\n### \n\n* Delivered duty paid (DDP) is a delivery agreement whereby the seller assumes all responsibility of transporting the goods until they reach an agreed-upon destination.\n* The seller must arrange for all transportation and associated costs including export clearance and customs documentation required to reach the destination port.2\n* The risks to the seller are broad and include VAT charges, bribery, and storage costs if unexpected delays occur.2\n* A DDP benefits a buyer as the seller assumes most of the liability and costs for shipping.2\n\n## Understanding Delivered Duty Paid (DDP)\n\nDelivered duty paid (DDP) is a shipping agreement that places the maximum responsibility on the seller. In addition to shipping costs, the seller is obligated to arrange for [import](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import.asp) clearance, tax payment, and [import duty](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import-duty.asp). The risk transfers to the buyer once the goods are made available to the buyer at the port of destination. The buyer and seller must agree on all payment details and state the name of the place of destination before finalizing the transaction.1\n\nDDP was developed by the [International Chamber of Commerce](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-chamber-of-commerce-icc.asp) (ICC) which sought to standardize shipping globally; hence, DDP is most commonly used in international shipping transactions. The benefits of DDP lean in favor of the buyer as they assume less liability and fewer costs in the shipping process, this, therefore, places a great deal of burden on the seller.3\n\n## Seller's Responsibilities\n\nThe seller arranges for transportation through a carrier of any kind and is responsible for the cost of that carrier as well as acquiring customs clearance in the buyer's country, including obtaining the appropriate approvals from the authorities in that country. Also, the seller may need to acquire a license for importation. However, the seller is not responsible for unloading the goods.2\n\nThe seller’s responsibilities include providing the goods, drawing up a sales contract and related documents, export packaging, arranging for export clearance, satisfying all import, [export](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp), and customs requirements, and paying for all transportation costs including final delivery to an agreed-upon destination.2\n\nThe seller must arrange for proof of delivery and pay the cost of all inspections and must alert the buyer once the goods are delivered to the agreed-upon location. In a DDP transaction, if the goods are damaged or lost in transit, the seller is liable for the costs.2\n\n## Managing Customs\n\nIt is not always possible for the shipper to clear the goods through customs in foreign countries. Customs requirements for DDP shipments vary by country. In some countries, import clearance is complicated and lengthy, so it is preferable if the buyer, who has intimate knowledge of the process, manages this process.\n\nIf a DDP shipment does not clear customs, customs may ignore the fact that the shipment is DDP and delay the shipment. Depending on the customs' decision, this may result in the seller using different, more costly delivery methods.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nDDP is used when the cost of supply is relatively stable and easy to predict. The seller is subject to the most risk, so DDP is normally used by advanced suppliers; however, some experts believe that there are reasons U.S. exporters and importers should not use DDP.4\n\nU.S exporters, for example, may be subject to [value-added tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp) (VAT) at a rate of up to 20%.5 Moreover, the buyer is eligible to receive a VAT refund. Exporters are also subject to unexpected storage and [demurrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demurrage.asp) costs that might occur due to delays by customs, agencies, or carriers. Bribery is a risk that could bring severe consequences both with the U.S government and a foreign country.\n\nFor U.S. importers, because the seller and its forwarder are controlling the transportation, the importer has limited [supply chain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp) information. Also, a seller may pad their prices to cover the cost of liability for the DDP shipment or markup freight bills.\n\nIf DDP is handled poorly, inbound shipments are likely to be examined by customs, which causes delays. Late shipments may also occur because a seller may use cheaper, less reliable transportation services to reduce their costs.\n\nSince DDP is an important aspect of customer relationship management (CRM) for delivery companies, it's important for businesses to invest in the [best CRM software](https://www.investopedia.com/best-crm-software-5116883) currently available.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsv6EsK7_Zdx_QvcBWVOMEmGEGI6SdXtnqmeWDtWyCLF2mO_Rx4HBCE7np0qfjcpnNyVJtQMwuU851T0t3e5C-EBFJnVXtteMFFR--ujQdRYGHDeIS8oJ7Iz5uU4XNFVx63aMNZCh5LvetcveS8nwRE1oatG9k-4aPFSaoqG6eLFLTkHzom0mXtXnOYG5aEdLKrk5hT5TOxXsL9xtx55pXhIYm-t1qQDtxmQHDfP8KmqR5bFnu0Nk6cyBP6g6770jVji1IGmQ-B44LdxE8Y5iczZ4zIfZHw2_wHXmYt3xnVA1l-JbqgBy3l038Rm8Wc4dGWDBMgC8WhZGXTsBnrfPihUQUEWhp8&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKiAq4zr6c1BEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

{"id": "xsfbojLcqtHIrUmeOdw-6Q1C0_bEDumpz11RO3LcYRg", "title": "Factors of Production", "body": "## What Are Factors of Production?\n\nFactors of production are the inputs needed for creating a good or service, and the factors of production include [land](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/land.asp), labor, [entrepreneurship](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp), and [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Factors of production is an economic term that describes the inputs used in the production of goods or services to make an economic profit.\n* These include any resource needed for the creation of a good or service.\n* The factors of production are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.1\n* The state of technological progress can influence the total factors of production and account for any efficiencies not related to the four typical factors.\n* Land as a factor of production can mean agriculture and farming to the use of natural resources.\n\n#### Factors Of Production\n\n## How Factors of Production Work\n\nThe modern definition of factors of production is primarily derived from a [neoclassical](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neoclassical.asp) view of economics. It amalgamates past approaches to economic theory, such as the concept of labor as a factor of production from socialism, into a single definition. \n\nLand, labor, and capital as factors of production were originally identified by [early political economists](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/economists.asp) such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx. Today, capital and labor remain the two primary inputs for processes and profits. Production, such as manufacturing, can be tracked by certain indexes, including the [ISM manufacturing index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ism-mfg.asp).\n\n## 4 Factors of Production\n\nThere are four factors of production—land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020\n\n## Land As a Factor\n\nLand has a broad definition as a factor of production and can take on various forms, from agricultural land to commercial real estate to the resources available from a particular piece of land. Natural resources, such as oil and gold, can be extracted and refined for human consumption from the land.\n\nCultivation of crops on land by farmers increases its value and utility. For a group of early French economists called “the physiocrats,” who predated the [classical political economists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/classicaleconomics.asp), land was responsible for generating economic value.\n\nWhile land is an essential component of most ventures, its importance can diminish or increase based on industry. For example, a technology company can easily begin operations with zero investment in land. On the other hand, land is the most significant investment for a real estate venture.\n\n## Labor As a Factor\n\nLabor refers to the effort expended by an individual to bring a product or service to the market. Again, it can take on various forms. For example, the construction worker at a hotel site is part of labor, as is the waiter who serves guests or the receptionist who enrolls them into the hotel.\n\nWithin the [software industry](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050416/industry-handbook-software-industry.asp), labor refers to the work done by project managers and developers in building the final product. Even an artist involved in making art, whether it is a painting or a symphony, is considered labor. For the early political economists, labor was the [primary driver of economic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-theory-of-value.asp). Production workers are paid for their time and effort in wages that depend on their skill and training. Labor by an uneducated and untrained worker is typically paid at low prices. Skilled and trained workers are called “[human capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humancapital.asp)” and are paid higher wages because they bring more than their physical capacity to the task.\n\nFor example, an accountant’s job requires the analysis of financial data for a company. Countries that are rich in human capital experience increased productivity and efficiency. The difference in skill levels and terminology also helps companies and entrepreneurs create corresponding disparities in pay scales. This can result in a transformation of factors of production for entire industries. An example of this is the change in production processes in the information technology (IT) industry after jobs were outsourced to countries with lower salaries.\n\n## Capital As a Factor\n\nIn economics, capital typically refers to money. However, money is not a factor of production because it is not directly involved in producing a good or service. Instead, it facilitates the processes used in production by enabling entrepreneurs and company owners to purchase capital goods or land or to pay wages. For modern mainstream (neoclassical) economists, capital is the primary driver of value.\n\nIt is important to distinguish personal and private capital in factors of production. A personal vehicle used to transport family is not considered a capital good, but a commercial vehicle used expressly for official purposes is. During an economic contraction or when they suffer losses, companies cut back on capital expenditure to ensure profits. However, during periods of economic expansion, they invest in new machinery and equipment to bring new products to market.\n\nAn illustration of the above is the difference in markets for robots in China compared to the United States after the 2008 financial crisis. After the crisis, China experienced a multi-year growth cycle,2 and its manufacturers invested in robots to improve productivity at their facilities and meet growing market demands.3 As a result, the country became the biggest market for robots.4 Manufacturers within the United States, which had been in the throes of an economic recession after the financial crisis, cut back on their investments related to production due to tepid demand.5   \n\nAs a factor of production, capital refers to the purchase of goods made with money in production. For example, a tractor purchased for farming is capital. Along the same lines, desks and chairs used in an office are also capital.\n\n## Entrepreneurship As a Factor\n\nEntrepreneurship is the secret sauce that combines all the other factors of production into a product or service for the consumer market. An example of entrepreneurship is the evolution of the social media behemoth Meta ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=fb)), formerly Facebook.\n\n[Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mark-zuckerberg.asp) assumed the risk for the success or failure of his social media network when he began allocating time from his daily schedule toward that activity. When he coded the minimum viable product himself, Zuckerberg’s labor was the only factor of production. After Facebook, the social media site, became popular and spread across campuses, it realized it needed to recruit additional employees. He hired two people, an engineer (Dustin Moskovitz) and a spokesperson (Chris Hughes), who both allocated hours to the project, meaning that their invested time became a factor of production.6\n\nThe continued popularity of the product meant that Zuckerberg also had to scale technology and operations. He raised venture capital money to rent office space, hire more employees, and purchase additional server space for development. At first, there was no need for land. However, as business continued to grow, Meta built its own office space and data centers.7 Each of these requires significant real estate and capital investments.\n\n## Connecting the Factors\n\nAnother example of entrepreneurship is Starbucks Corporation ([SBUX](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=sbux)). The retail coffee chain needs land (prime real estate in big cities for its coffee chain), capital (large machinery to produce and dispense coffee), and labor (employees at its retail outposts for service). Entrepreneur Howard Schultz, the company’s founder, provided the fourth factor of production by being the first person to realize that a market for such a chain existed and figuring out the connections among the other three factors of production.8\n\nWhile large companies make for excellent examples, a majority of companies within the United States are small businesses started by entrepreneurs. Because entrepreneurs are vital for economic growth, countries are creating the necessary framework and policies to make it easier for them to start companies.\n\n## Ownership of Factors of Production\n\nThe definition of factors of production in economic systems presumes that ownership lies with households, who lend or lease them to entrepreneurs and organizations. But that is a theoretical construct and rarely the case in practice. Except for labor, ownership for factors of production varies based on industry and economic system.\n\nFor example, a firm operating in the real estate industry typically owns significant parcels of land, while retail corporations and shops lease land for extended periods of time. Capital also follows a similar model in that it can be owned or leased from another party. Under no circumstances, however, is labor owned by firms. Labor’s transaction with firms is based on wages.\n\nOwnership of the factors of production also differs based on the economic system. For example, private enterprises and individuals own most of the factors of production in capitalism. However, collective good is the predominating principle in socialism. As such, factors of production, such as land and capital, are owned and regulated by the community as a whole under socialism.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nWhile not directly listed as a factor, technology plays a vital role in influencing production. In this context, technology has a fairly broad definition and can refer to software, hardware, or a combination of both used to streamline organizational or manufacturing processes.\n\nIncreasingly, technology is responsible for the difference in efficiency among firms. To that end, technology—like money—is a facilitator of the factors of production. The introduction of technology into a labor or capital process makes it more efficient. For example, [the use of robots in manufacturing](https://www.investopedia.com/sectors-and-industries-analysis-4689756) has the potential to improve productivity and output. Similarly, the use of kiosks in self-serve restaurants can help firms cut back on their labor costs.\n\n[The Solow residual](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solow-residual.asp), also known as \"total factor productivity (TFP),\" measures the residual output that remains unaccounted for from the four factors of production and typically increases when technological processes or equipment are applied to production. Economists consider TFP to be the main factor driving economic growth for a country. The greater a firm's or country's TFP, the greater its growth.\n\n## What Are the Factors of Production?\n\nThe factors of production are an important economic concept outlining the elements needed to produce a good or service for sale. They are commonly broken down into four elements: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. However, commentators sometimes refer to labor and capital as the two primary factors of production. Depending on the specific circumstances, one or more factors of production might be more important than the others.\n\n## What Are Examples of the Factors of Production?\n\nLand refers to physical land, such as the acres used for a farm or the city block on which a building is constructed. Labor refers to all wage-earning activities, such as the work of professionals, retail workers, and so on. Entrepreneurship refers to the initiatives taken by entrepreneurs, who typically begin as the first workers in their firms and then gradually employ other factors of production to grow their businesses. Finally, capital refers to the cash, equipment, and other assets needed to start or grow a business.\n\n## Are All Factors of Production Equally Important?\n\nDepending on the context, some factors of production might be more important than others. For example, a software company that relies primarily on the labor of skilled software engineers might see labor as its most valuable factor of production. Meanwhile, a company that makes its money from building and renting out office space might see land and capital as its most valuable factors. As the demands of a business change over time, the relative importance of the factors of production will also change accordingly.", "timestamp": 1654657539, "digest": "xXLsUvMQzCkx940MGxXby6Mf8kxLvgFN0CKfHrXmK00", "contributor": "0x382FdEf874E2989f6eCE2C1cF960Dfe12bCda5Cd"}

{"id": "6qLa173spplWzoTodf1nTf6Pig34Bcn2fXzJX5nXbYE", "title": "Externality", "body": "## What Is an Externality?\n\nAn externality is a cost or benefit caused by a producer that is not financially incurred or received by that producer. An externality can be both positive or negative and can stem from either the production or [consumption](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/what-difference-between-induced-consumption-and-autonomous-consumption.asp) of a good or service. The costs and benefits can be both private—to an individual or an organization—or social, meaning it can affect society as a whole.\n\nExternalities by nature are generally environmental, such as natural resources or public health. For example, a negative externality is a business that causes pollution that diminishes the property values or health of people in the surrounding area. A positive externality includes actions that reduce transmission of disease or avoids the use of lawn treatments that runoff to rivers and thus contribute to excess plant growth in lakes. Externalities are different from donations of parkland or open-source software.\n\n## Understanding Externalities\n\nExternalities occur in an economy when the production or consumption of a specific good or service impacts a third party that is not directly related to the production or consumption of that good or service.\n\nAlmost all externalities are considered to be technical externalities. Technical externalities have an impact on the consumption and production opportunities of unrelated third parties, but the price of consumption does not include the externalities. This exclusion creates a gap between the gain or loss of private individuals and the aggregate [gain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gain.asp) or loss of society as a whole.\n\nThe action of an individual or organization often results in positive private gains but detracts from the overall economy. Many economists consider technical externalities to be market deficiencies, and this is the reason people advocate for government intervention to curb negative externalities through taxation and regulation.\n\nExternalities were once the responsibility of local governments and those affected by them. So, for instance, municipalities were responsible for paying for the effects of pollution from a factory in the area while the residents were responsible for their healthcare costs as a result of the pollution. After the late 1990s, governments enacted legislation imposing the cost of externalities on the producer. This legislation increased costs, which many corporations passed on to the consumer, making their goods and services more expensive.\n\n#### Externality\n\n### Positive and Negative Externalities\n\nMost externalities are negative. Pollution is a well-known negative externality. A corporation may decide to cut costs and increase profits by implementing new operations that are more harmful to the environment. The corporation realizes costs in the form of expanding operations but also generates returns that are higher than the costs.\n\nHowever, the externality also increases the aggregate cost to the economy and society making it a negative externality. Externalities are negative when the social costs outweigh the private costs.\n\nSome externalities are positive. Positive externalities occur when there is a positive gain on both the private level and social level. [Research and development](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp) (R&D) conducted by a company can be a positive externality. R&D increases the private profits of a company but also has the added benefit of increasing the general level of knowledge within a society.\n\nSimilarly, the emphasis on education is also a positive externality. Investment in education leads to a smarter and more intelligent workforce. Companies benefit from hiring employees who are educated because they are knowledgeable. This benefits employers because a better-educated workforce requires less investment in employee training and development costs.\n\n## Overcoming Externalities\n\nThere are solutions that exist to overcome the negative effects of externalities. These can include those from both the public and [private sectors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp).\n\nTaxes are one solution to overcoming externalities. To help reduce the negative effects of certain externalities such as pollution, governments can impose a tax on the goods causing the externalities. The tax, called a [Pigovian tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pigoviantax.asp)—named after economist Arthur C. Pigou, sometimes called a Pigouvian tax—is considered to be equal to the value of the negative externality. This tax is meant to discourage activities that impose a net cost to an unrelated third party. That means that the imposition of this type of tax will reduce the market outcome of the externality to an amount that is considered efficient.\n\n[Subsidies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp) can also overcome negative externalities by encouraging the consumption of a positive externality. One example would be to subsidize orchards that plant fruit trees to provide positive externalities to beekeepers.\n\nGovernments can also implement regulations to offset the effects of externalities. Regulation is considered the most common solution. The public often turns to governments to pass and enact legislation and regulation to curb the negative effects of externalities. Several examples include environmental regulations or health-related legislation.", "timestamp": 1654657877, "digest": "F_t920MR60uNef6Bomx2Nk6IvQL5hyb5EmMjFWOJw-4", "contributor": "0x1b33861855453bD8FBD4e9Eb309e5c202B82CF0f"}
{"id": "6u2g4ZHixKsMN81RAWInE9J37h5FJm72yQvAYlEhRBU", "title": "Price Elasticity of Demand", "body": "## What Is Price Elasticity of Demand?\n\nPrice elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in the consumption of a product in relation to a change in its price. Expressed mathematically, it is:\n\n> *Price Elasticity of Demand = Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded / Percentage Change in Price \n *\n\nEconomists use price elasticity to understand how supply and demand for a product change when its price changes.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Price elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in consumption of a product in relation to a change in its price.\n* A good is elastic if a price change causes a substantial change in demand or supply.\n* A good is inelastic if a price change does not cause demand or supply to change very much.\n* The availability of a substitute for a product affects its elasticity. If there are no good substitutes and the product is necessary, demand won’t change when the price goes up, making it inelastic.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 40 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:40\n\n#### What Is Elasticity?\n\n## Understanding Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nEconomists have found that the prices of some goods are very [inelastic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/inelastic.asp).2 That is, a reduction in price does not increase demand much, and an increase in price does not hurt demand either. For example, gasoline has little price elasticity of demand. Drivers will continue to buy as much as they have to, as will airlines, the trucking industry, and nearly every other buyer.\n\nOther goods are much more [elastic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elastic.asp), so price changes for these goods cause substantial changes in their demand or their supply.2\n\nNot surprisingly, this concept is of great interest to marketing professionals.1 It could even be said that their purpose is to create inelastic demand for the products they market. They achieve that by identifying a meaningful difference in their products from any others that are available.\n\nIf the [quantity demanded](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitydemanded.asp) of a product changes greatly in response to changes in its price, it is elastic. That is, the demand point for the product is stretched far from its prior point. If the quantity purchased shows a small change after a change in its price, it is inelastic. The quantity didn’t stretch much from its prior point. \n\n## Special Considerations\n\n### Availability of substitutes is a factor\n\nThe more easily a shopper can substitute one product for another, the more the price will fall. For example, in a world in which people like coffee and tea equally, if the price of coffee goes up, people will have no problem switching to tea, and the demand for coffee will fall. This is because coffee and tea are considered good [substitutes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substitution-effect.asp) for each other.\n\n### Urgency is a factor\n\nThe more [discretionary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionary-expense.asp) a purchase is, the more its quantity of demand will fall in response to price increases. That is, the product demand has greater elasticity.3\n\nSay you are considering buying a new washing machine, but the current one still works; it's just old and outdated. If the price of a new washing machine goes up, you’re likely to forgo that immediate purchase and wait until prices go down or the current machine breaks down.\n\nThe less discretionary a product is, the less its quantity demanded will fall. Inelastic examples include luxury items that people buy for their brand names. Addictive products are quite inelastic, as are required add-on products, such as ink-jet printer cartridges.\n\nOne thing all of these products have in common is that they lack good substitutes. If you really want an Apple iPad, a Kindle Fire won’t do. Addicts are not dissuaded by higher prices, and only HP ink will work in HP printers (unless you disable HP cartridge protection).\n\n### Sales skew the numbers\n\nThe length of time that the price change lasts also matters.3 [Demand response to price fluctuations](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-factors-influence-change-demand-elasticity.asp) is different for a one-day sale than for a price change that lasts for a season or a year.\n\nClarity of time sensitivity is vital to understanding the price elasticity of demand and for comparing it with different products. [Consumers may accept a seasonal price fluctuation](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/how-does-law-supply-and-demand-affect-prices.asp) rather than change their habits.\n\n## Example of Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if the quantity of a product demanded or purchased changes more than the price changes, the product is considered to be elastic. (For example, the price goes up by 5%, but the demand falls by 10%.)\n\nIf the change in quantity purchased is the same as the price change (say, 10%/10% = 1), the product is said to have unit (or unitary) price elasticity.\n\nFinally, if the quantity purchased changes less than the price (say, -5% demanded for a +10% change in price), then the product is deemed inelastic.\n\nTo calculate the elasticity of demand, consider this example: Suppose that the price of apples falls by 6% from $1.99 a bushel to $1.87 a bushel. In response, grocery shoppers increase their apple purchases by 20%. The elasticity of apples is thus: 0.20/0.06 = 3.33. The demand for apples is quite elastic.\n\n## What Is Price Elasticity of Demand?\n\nPrice elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded of a product to the percentage change in price. Economists employ it to understand how supply and demand change when a product’s price changes.\n\n## What Makes a Product Elastic?\n\nIf a price change for a product causes a substantial change in either its supply or demand, it is considered elastic. Generally, it means that there are acceptable substitutes for the product. Examples would be cookies, luxury automobiles, and coffee.\n\n## What Makes a Product Inelastic?\n\nIf a price change for a product doesn’t lead to much if any change in its supply or demand, it is considered inelastic. Generally, it means that the product is considered to be a necessity or a luxury item with addictive constituents. Examples would be gasoline, milk, and iPhones.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuGxVHP5kYVGZmb7ZWoWFmyAjpi09DiXWRg1rhhrt21CaAuVKG14WuRveav7kaRziqUBgzdBJRv4eAx5ck7DSp8DZwIwPZrh9Zbssdn_CoZXBrjDlEW7mcYcle5CpbHAMvEfZ2Js23DsU-cgJyRDjWrvMb6KiNvKpxzT1G-u5i8aJwaeIQmPbhrr11dodfxRMHV-MqG8jOPklIWo1Mh92RjoAQ7249-jWwLlnI2zEaNU4rR8ON8E4MTzx3q8rGb95kNbwrEMzHUuPVz6A6dFfZAAuQ9Q0u1mqhzXR3zNXlP-EDmOLncKWwNdZMuYksNXF2_fAiLRucuc4s-jGFK0zAHsmdpJ5_BZ6NggP6mmCrNs90&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAw7Lt2uMZEbEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuGxVHP5kYVGZmb7ZWoWFmyAjpi09DiXWRg1rhhrt21CaAuVKG14WuRveav7kaRziqUBgzdBJRv4eAx5ck7DSp8DZwIwPZrh9Zbssdn_CoZXBrjDlEW7mcYcle5CpbHAMvEfZ2Js23DsU-cgJyRDjWrvMb6KiNvKpxzT1G-u5i8aJwaeIQmPbhrr11dodfxRMHV-MqG8jOPklIWo1Mh92RjoAQ7249-jWwLlnI2zEaNU4rR8ON8E4MTzx3q8rGb95kNbwrEMzHUuPVz6A6dFfZAAuQ9Q0u1mqhzXR3zNXlP-EDmOLncKWwNdZMuYksNXF2_fAiLRucuc4s-jGFK0zAHsmdpJ5_BZ6NggP6mmCrNs90&sig=Cg0ArKJSzAw7Lt2uMZEbEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

Expressed mathematically, it is:\n\n> *Price Elasticity of Demand = Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded / Percentage Change in Price \n *\n\nEconomists use price elasticity to understand how supply and demand for a product change when its price changes.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Price elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in consumption of a product in relation to a change in its price.\n* A good is elastic if a price change causes a substantial change in demand or supply.\n* A good is inelastic if a price change does not cause demand or supply to change very much.\n* The availability of a substitute for a product affects its elasticity. If there are no good substitutes and the product is necessary, demand won’t change when the price goes up, making it inelastic.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 40 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:40\n\n#### What Is Elasticity?\n\n## Understanding Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nEconomists have found that the prices of some goods are very [inelastic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/inelastic.asp).2 That is, a reduction in price does not increase demand much, and an increase in price does not hurt demand either. For example, gasoline has little price elasticity of demand. Drivers will continue to buy as much as they have to, as will airlines, the trucking industry, and nearly every other buyer.\n\nOther goods are much more [elastic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elastic.asp), so price changes for these goods cause substantial changes in their demand or their supply.2\n\nNot surprisingly, this concept is of great interest to marketing professionals.1 It could even be said that their purpose is to create inelastic demand for the products they market. They achieve that by identifying a meaningful difference in their products from any others that are available.\n\nIf the [quantity demanded](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitydemanded.asp) of a product changes greatly in response to changes in its price, it is elastic. That is, the demand point for the product is stretched far from its prior point. If the quantity purchased shows a small change after a change in its price, it is inelastic. The quantity didn’t stretch much from its prior point. \n\n## Special Considerations\n\n### Availability of substitutes is a factor\n\nThe more easily a shopper can substitute one product for another, the more the price will fall. For example, in a world in which people like coffee and tea equally, if the price of coffee goes up, people will have no problem switching to tea, and the demand for coffee will fall. This is because coffee and tea are considered good [substitutes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substitution-effect.asp) for each other.\n\n### Urgency is a factor\n\nThe more [discretionary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionary-expense.asp) a purchase is, the more its quantity of demand will fall in response to price increases. That is, the product demand has greater elasticity.3\n\nSay you are considering buying a new washing machine, but the current one still works; it's just old and outdated. If the price of a new washing machine goes up, you’re likely to forgo that immediate purchase and wait until prices go down or the current machine breaks down.\n\nThe less discretionary a product is, the less its quantity demanded will fall. Inelastic examples include luxury items that people buy for their brand names. Addictive products are quite inelastic, as are required add-on products, such as ink-jet printer cartridges.\n\nOne thing all of these products have in common is that they lack good substitutes. If you really want an Apple iPad, a Kindle Fire won’t do. Addicts are not dissuaded by higher prices, and only HP ink will work in HP printers (unless you disable HP cartridge protection).\n\n### Sales skew the numbers\n\nThe length of time that the price change lasts also matters.3 [Demand response to price fluctuations](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-factors-influence-change-demand-elasticity.asp) is different for a one-day sale than for a price change that lasts for a season or a year.\n\nClarity of time sensitivity is vital to understanding the price elasticity of demand and for comparing it with different products. [Consumers may accept a seasonal price fluctuation](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/how-does-law-supply-and-demand-affect-prices.asp) rather than change their habits.\n\n## Example of Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if the quantity of a product demanded or purchased changes more than the price changes, the product is considered to be elastic.

{"id": "bZJwN9MaZhsq-bE7Oda7KMAmwmgTeQ29GcZ7o1tPbYg", "title": "Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)", "body": "## What Is Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)?\n\nDays payable outstanding (DPO) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time (in days) that a company takes to pay its bills and invoices to its trade creditors, which may include suppliers, vendors, or financiers. The ratio is typically calculated on a quarterly or annual basis, and it indicates how well the company’s cash outflows are being managed.\n\nA company with a higher value of DPO takes longer to pay its bills, which means that it can retain available funds for a longer duration, allowing the company an opportunity to use those funds in a better way to maximize the benefits. A high DPO, however, may also be a red flag indicating an inability to pay its bills on time.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Days payable outstanding (DPO) computes the average number of days a company needs to pay its bills and obligations.\n* Companies that have a high DPO can delay making payments and use the available cash for short-term investments as well as to increase their working capital and free cash flow.\n* However, higher values of DPO, though desirable, may not always be a positive for the business as it may signal a cash shortfall and inability to pay.\n\n#### Days Payable Outstanding\n\n## Formula for Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{DPO} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Accounts Payable}\\\\times\\\\text{Number of Days}}{\\\\text{COGS}}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{COGS}=\\\\text{Cost of Goods Sold} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad\\\\ \\\\ \\\\, \\\\,= \\\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\\\text{P} -\\\\text{Ending Inventory}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{P}=\\\\text{Purchases} \\\\end{aligned}​DPO=COGSAccounts Payable×Number of Days​where:COGS=Cost of Goods Sold  =Beginning Inventory+P−Ending InventoryP=Purchases​﻿\n\n## How To Calculate DPO\n\nTo manufacture a salable product, a company needs raw material, utilities, and other resources. In terms of accounting practices, the accounts payable represents how much money the company owes to its supplier(s) for purchases made on credit.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cost associated with manufacturing the salable product, and it includes payment for utilities like electricity and employee wages. This is represented by [cost of goods sold (COGS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp), which is defined as the cost of acquiring or manufacturing the products that a company sells during a period. Both of these figures represent cash outflows and are used in calculating DPO over a period of time.\n\nThe number of days in the corresponding period is usually taken as 365 for a year and 90 for a quarter. The formula takes account of the average per day cost being borne by the company for manufacturing a salable product. The numerator figure represents payments outstanding. The net factor gives the average number of days taken by the company to pay off its obligations after receiving the bills.\n\nTwo different versions of the DPO formula are used depending upon the accounting practices. In one of the versions, the accounts payable amount is taken as the figure reported at the end of the accounting period, like “at the end of fiscal year/quarter ending Sept. 30.” This version represents the DPO value as of the mentioned date.\n\nIn another version, the average value of beginning AP and ending AP is taken, and the resulting figure represents the DPO value during that particular period. COGS remains the same in both versions.\n\n## What Does DPO Tell You?\n\nGenerally, a company acquires inventory, utilities, and other necessary services on credit. It results in [accounts payable (AP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp), a key accounting entry that represents a company's obligation to pay off the short-term liabilities to its creditors or suppliers. Beyond the actual dollar amount to be paid, the timing of the payments*—*from the date of receiving the bill till the cash actually going out of the company’s account*—*also becomes an important aspect of the business. DPO attempts to measure this average time cycle for outward payments and is calculated by taking the standard accounting figures into consideration over a specified period of time.\n\nCompanies having high DPO can use the available cash for short-term investments and to increase their [working capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) and [free cash flow (FCF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp). However, higher values of DPO may not always be a positive for the business. If the company takes too long to pay its creditors, it risks jeopardizing its relations with the suppliers and creditors who may refuse to offer the trade credit in the future or may offer it on terms that may be less favorable to the company. The company may also be losing out on any discounts on timely payments, if available, and it may be paying more than necessary.\n\nAdditionally, a company may need to balance its outflow tenure with that of the inflow. Imagine if a company allows a 90-day period for its customers to pay for the goods they purchase but has only a 30-day window to pay its suppliers and vendors. This mismatch will result in the company being prone to cash crunch frequently. Companies must strike a delicate balance with DPO.\n\nA high DPO can indicate a company that is using capital resourcefully but it can also show that the company is struggling to pay its creditors.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nTypical DPO values vary widely across different industry sectors and it is not worthwhile comparing these values across different sector companies. A firm's management will instead compare its DPO to the average within its industry to see if it is paying its vendors too quickly or too slowly. Depending upon the various global and local factors, like the overall performance of the economy, region, and sector, plus any applicable seasonal impacts, the DPO value of a particular company can vary significantly from year to year, company to company, and industry to industry.\n\nDPO value also forms an integral part of the formula used for calculating the [cash conversion cycle (CCC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashconversioncycle.asp), another key metric that expresses the length of time that a company takes to convert the resource inputs into realized cash flows from sales. While DPO focuses on the current outstanding payable by the business, the superset CCC follows the entire cash time-cycle as the cash is first converted into inventory, expenses, and accounts payable, through to sales and accounts receivable, and then back into cash in hand when received.\n\n## Example of How DPO Is Used\n\nAs a historical example, the leading retail corporation Walmart [(WMT)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=wmt) had accounts payable worth $49.1 billion and cost of sales (cost of goods sold) worth $420.3 billion for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2021.1 These figures are available in the annual [financial statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) and [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) of the company. Taking the number of days as 365 for annual calculation, the DPO for Walmart comes to \\[ (49.1 x 365) / 420.1 \\] = 42.7 days.\n\nSimilar calculations can be used for technology leader Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=msft), which had $2.8 billion as AP and $41.3 billion as COGS, leading to a DPO value of 24.7 days.2\n\nIt indicates that during the fiscal year ending in 2021, Walmart paid its invoices around 43 days after receiving the bills, while Microsoft took around 25 days, on average, to pay its bills.\n\nA look at similar figures for the online retail giant Amazon [(AMZN)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn), which had an AP of $72.5 billion and COGS of $233.3 billion for the fiscal year 2020, reveals a very high value of 113.4 days. Such high value of DPO is attributed to the working model of Amazon, which roughly has 50% of its sales being supplied by third-party sellers.3 Amazon instantly receives funds in its account for the sale of goods that are actually supplied by third-party sellers using Amazon’s online platform.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t pay the sellers immediately after the sale but may send accumulated payments based on a weekly/monthly or threshold-based payment cycle. This working mechanism allows Amazon to hold onto the cash for a longer period of time, and the leading online retailer ends up with a significantly higher DPO.\n\n## Limitations of DPO\n\nWhile DPO is useful in comparing relative strength among companies, there is no clear-cut figure for what constitutes a healthy days payable outstanding, as the DPO varies significantly by industry, competitive positioning of the company, and its bargaining power. Large companies with a strong power of negotiation are able to contract for better terms with suppliers and creditors, effectively producing lower DPO figures than they would have otherwise.\n\n## What Does Days Payable Outstanding Mean in Accounting?\n\nAs a financial ratio, days of payable outstanding (DPO) shows the amount of time that companies take to pay financiers, creditors, vendors, or suppliers. The DPO may indicate a few things, namely, how a company is managing its cash, or the means for a company to utilize this cash towards short-term investments that in turn may amplify their cash flow. The DPO is measured on a quarterly or annual term.\n\n## How Do You Calculate Days Payable Outstanding?\n\nTo calculate days of payable outstanding (DPO), the following formula is applied: DPO = Accounts Payable X Number of Days/Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Here, COGS refers to beginning inventory plus purchases subtracting the ending inventory. Accounts payable, on the other hand, refers to company purchases that were made on credit that are due to its suppliers.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between DPO and DSO?\n\nDays payable outstanding (DPO) is the average time for a company to pay its bills. By contrast, days sales outstanding (DSO) is the average length of time for sales to be paid back to the company. When a DSO is high, it indicates that the company is waiting extended periods to collect money for products that it sold on credit. By contrast, a high DPO could be interpreted multiple ways, either indicating that the company is utilizing its cash on hand to create more working capital, or indicating poor management of free cash flow.", "timestamp": 1654657993, "digest": "r_Ub2WFggJl5NjpTVTic_STewk84d3j2zgqY1Lpdatk", "contributor": "0xA1Cfd6747f274900d8435c4cD4A0827E5e44f2Ca"}
{"id": "EepXPb14eUSkrrshA21X66Y575NdjywvP1mQ1fvRG6E", "title": "Demand", "body": "## What is Demand?\n\nDemand is an economic principle referring to a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services and willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service. Holding all other factors constant, an increase in the price of a good or service [will decrease the quantity demanded, and vice versa](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042815/which-economic-factors-most-affect-demand-consumer-goods.asp). Market demand is the total quantity demanded across all consumers in a market for a given good. Aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in an economy. Multiple [stocking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/make-to-stock.asp) strategies are often required to handle demand.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Demand refers to consumers' desire to purchase goods and services at given prices.\n* Demand can mean either market demand for a specific good or aggregate demand for the total of all goods in an economy.\n* Demand, along with supply, determines the actual prices of goods and the volume of goods that changes hands in a market.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 25 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:25\n\n#### What is Demand?\n\n## Understanding Demand\n\n[Businesses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business.asp) often spend a considerable amount of money to determine the amount of demand the public has for their products and services. How much of their goods will they actually be able to sell at any given price? Incorrect estimations either result in money left on the table if demand is underestimated or losses if demand is overestimated. Demand is what helps fuel the economy, and without it, businesses would not produce anything.\n\nDemand is closely related to [supply](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply.asp). While consumers try to pay the lowest prices they can for goods and services, suppliers try to maximize profits. If suppliers charge too much, the quantity demanded drops and suppliers do not sell enough product to earn sufficient profits. If suppliers charge too little, the quantity demanded increases but lower prices may not cover suppliers’ costs or allow for profits. Some factors affecting demand include the appeal of a good or service, the availability of competing goods, the availability of [financing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp), and the [perceived availability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratchet-effect.asp) of a good or service.\n\n## Supply and Demand Curves\n\nSupply and demand factors are unique for a given product or service. These factors are often summed up in demand and supply profiles plotted as slopes on a graph. On such a graph, the vertical axis denotes the price, while the horizontal axis denotes the [quantity demanded](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitydemanded.asp) or supplied. A demand curve slopes downward, from left to right. As prices increase, consumers demand less of a good or service. A [supply curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply-curve.asp) slopes upward. As prices increase, suppliers provide more of a good or service.\n\n## Market Equilibrium\n\nThe point where supply and demand curves intersect represents the market clearing or market equilibrium price. An increase in demand shifts the [demand curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand-curve.asp) to the right. The curves intersect at a higher price and consumers pay more for the product. [Equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp) prices typically remain in a state of flux for most goods and services because factors affecting supply and demand are always changing. Free, competitive markets tend to push prices toward market equilibrium.\n\n## Market Demand vs. Aggregate Demand\n\nThe market for each good in an economy faces a different set of circumstances, which vary in type and degree. In macroeconomics, we can also look at aggregate demand in an economy. [Aggregate demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp) refers to the total demand by all consumers for all good and services in an economy across all the markets for individual goods. Because aggregate includes all goods in an economy, it is not sensitive to competition or substitution between different goods or changes in consumer preferences between various goods in the same way that demand in individual good markets can be.\n\n## Macroeconomic Policy and Demand\n\nFiscal and monetary authorities, such as the [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp), devote much of their macroeconomic policy making toward managing aggregate demand. If the Fed wants to reduce demand, it will raise prices by curtailing the growth of the supply of money and credit and increasing interest rates. Conversely, the Fed can lower interest rates and increase the supply of money in the system, therefore increasing demand.1﻿ In this case, consumers and businesses have more money to spend. But in certain cases, even the Fed can’t fuel demand. When [unemployment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp) is on the rise, people may still not be able to afford to spend or take on cheaper debt, even with low interest rates.\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstc-y0CeHj0Nh1NhVtfqNGlIMreuOmSkEPqOyKX19C1CQQB0-QsAt7wBIP7M_diMv1rpgLXX6HHWvWYkrrEUmBKPOMk0OGZnU1pKE9NGmjd5BftsITVbe2uYhBPlDlSLsVjZSs00-wo2NM0nUhdnJa3gCMOysGnPgu9T1QBQ0SucJvUiKgD20-psdXnjP5wwThGShEHPX1Ib0ghWewm5wQeFn5NRm586ar3MAjzDzArjgsLQbfIqieRhovFjJQtc2Wqz9mukM81nnAj-V0Xt1pYaDJKCvGg1Bfgv_AdRtlOxy4jG_esZzhIr6xL6Xl5U-Unfw_L_xKTxBBi&sig=Cg0ArKJSzDdgawvGpFy4EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstc-y0CeHj0Nh1NhVtfqNGlIMreuOmSkEPqOyKX19C1CQQB0-QsAt7wBIP7M_diMv1rpgLXX6HHWvWYkrrEUmBKPOMk0OGZnU1pKE9NGmjd5BftsITVbe2uYhBPlDlSLsVjZSs00-wo2NM0nUhdnJa3gCMOysGnPgu9T1QBQ0SucJvUiKgD20-psdXnjP5wwThGShEHPX1Ib0ghWewm5wQeFn5NRm586ar3MAjzDzArjgsLQbfIqieRhovFjJQtc2Wqz9mukM81nnAj-V0Xt1pYaDJKCvGg1Bfgv_AdRtlOxy4jG_esZzhIr6xL6Xl5U-Unfw_L_xKTxBBi&sig=Cg0ArKJSzDdgawvGpFy4EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

Since debentures have no collateral backing, they must rely on the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer for support. Both corporations and governments frequently issue debentures to raise capital or funds.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A debenture is a type of debt instrument that is not backed by any collateral and usually has a term greater than 10 years.\n* Debentures are backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer.\n* Both corporations and governments frequently issue debentures to raise capital or funds.\n* Some debentures can convert to equity shares while others cannot.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 24 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:23\n\n#### Debentures\n\n## Understanding Debentures\n\nSimilar to most bonds, debentures may pay periodic interest payments called coupon payments. Like other types of bonds, debentures are documented in an [indenture](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indenture.asp). An indenture is a legal and binding contract between bond issuers and [bondholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp). The contract specifies features of a debt offering, such as the [maturity date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), the timing of interest or coupon payments, the method of interest calculation, and other features. Corporations and governments can issue debentures.\n\nGovernments typically issue long-term bonds—those with maturities of longer than 10 years. Considered low-risk investments, these government bonds have the backing of the government issuer.\n\nCorporations also use debentures as long-term loans. However, the debentures of corporations are unsecured.1 Instead, they have the backing of only the financial viability and creditworthiness of the underlying company. These debt instruments pay an interest rate and are redeemable or repayable on a fixed date. A company typically makes these scheduled debt interest payments before they pay stock dividends to shareholders. Debentures are advantageous for companies since they carry lower interest rates and longer repayment dates as compared to other types of loans and debt instruments.\n\n## Convertible vs. Nonconvertible\n\n[Convertible debentures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertibledebenture.asp) are bonds that can convert into equity shares of the issuing corporation after a specific period. Convertible debentures are hybrid financial products with the benefits of both debt and equity. Companies use debentures as fixed-rate loans and pay fixed interest payments. However, the holders of the debenture have the option of holding the loan until maturity and receive the interest payments or convert the loan into equity shares.\n\nConvertible debentures are attractive to investors that want to convert to equity if they believe the company's stock will rise in the long term. However, the ability to convert to equity comes at a price since convertible debentures pay a lower interest rate compared to other fixed-rate investments.\n\nNonconvertible debentures are traditional debentures that cannot be converted into equity of the issuing corporation. To compensate for the lack of convertibility investors are rewarded with a higher interest rate when compared to convertible debentures.\n\n## Features of a Debenture\n\nWhen issuing a debenture, first a trust indenture must be drafted. The first trust is an agreement between the issuing corporation and the trustee that manages the interest of the investors.\n\n### Interest Rate\n\nThe coupon rate is determined, which is the rate of interest that the company will pay the debenture holder or investor. This coupon rate can be either fixed or floating. A floating rate might be tied to a benchmark such as the yield of the 10-year Treasury bond and will change as the benchmark changes.\n\n### Credit Rating\n\nThe company's [credit rating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) and ultimately the debenture's credit rating impacts the interest rate that investors will receive. Credit-rating agencies measure the creditworthiness of corporate and government issues.2 These entities provide investors with an overview of the risks involved in investing in debt.\n\nCredit rating agencies, such as Standard and Poor's, typically assign letter grades indicating the underlying creditworthiness. The Standard & Poor’s system uses a scale that ranges from AAA for excellent rating to the lowest rating of C and D. Any debt instrument receiving a rating of lower than a BB is said to be of speculative grade.3 You may also hear these called junk bonds. It boils down to the underlying issuer being more likely to default on the debt.\n\n### Maturity Date\n\nFor nonconvertible debentures, mentioned above, the date of maturity is also an important feature. This date dictates when the company must pay back the debenture holders. The company has options on the form the repayment will take. Most often, it is as redemption from the capital, where the issuer pays a lump sum amount on the maturity of the debt. Alternatively, the payment may use a redemption reserve, where the company pays specific amounts each year until full repayment at the date of maturity.\n\n## Pros and Cons of Debentures\n\nPros\n\n* A debenture pays a regular interest rate or coupon rate return to investors.\n* Convertible debentures can be converted to equity shares after a specified period, making them more appealing to investors.\n* In the event of a corporation's bankruptcy, the debenture is paid before common stock shareholders.\n\nCons\n\n* Fixed-rate debentures may have interest rate risk exposure in environments where the market interest rate is rising.\n* Creditworthiness is important when considering the chance of default risk from the underlying issuer's financial viability.\n* Debentures may have inflationary risk if the coupon paid does not keep up with the rate of inflation.\n\n## Debenture Risks to Investors\n\nDebenture holders may face [inflationary risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflationrisk.asp).4 Here, the risk is that the debt's interest rate paid may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Inflation measures economy-based price increases. As an example, say inflation causes prices to increase by 3%, should the debenture coupon pay at 2%, the holders may see a net loss, in real terms.\n\nDebentures also carry [interest rate risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp).4 In this risk scenario, investors hold fixed-rate debts during times of rising market interest rates. These investors may find their debt returning less than what is available from other investments paying the current, higher, market rate. If this happens, the debenture holder earns a lower yield in comparison.\n\nFurther, debentures may carry credit risk and [default risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp).5 As stated earlier, debentures are only as secure as the underlying issuer's financial strength. If the company struggles financially due to internal or macroeconomic factors, investors are at risk of default on the debenture. As some consolation, a debenture holder would be repaid before common stock shareholders in the event of bankruptcy.\n\nThe three main features of a debenture are the interest rate, the credit rating and the maturity date.\n\n## Example of a Debenture\n\nAn example of a government debenture would be the U.S. [Treasury bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp) (T-bond). T-bonds help finance projects and fund day-to-day governmental operations. The U.S. Treasury Department issues these bonds during auctions held throughout the year. Some Treasury bonds trade in the secondary market. In the secondary market through a financial institution or broker, investors can buy and sell previously issued bonds. T-bonds are nearly risk-free since they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. However, they also face the risk of inflation and interest rates increase.6\n\n## Is a Debenture Different From a Bond?\n\nA debenture is a type of bond. In particular, it is an unsecured or non-collateralized debt issued by a firm or other entity and usually refers to such bonds with longer maturities.\n\n## Are Debentures Risky Investments?\n\nBecause debentures are debt securities, they tend to be less risky than investing in the same company's common stock or preferred shares. Debenture holders would also be considered more senior and take priority over those other types of investments in the case of bankruptcy.\n\n \n \n\nBecause these debts are not backed by any collateral, however, they are inherently riskier than secured debts. Therefore, these may carry relatively higher interest rates than otherwise similar bonds from the same issuer that are backed by collateral.\n\nIn fact, strictly speaking, a U.S. Treasury bond and a U.S. Treasury bill are both debentures. They are not secured by collateral, yet they are considered risk-free securities.\n\n## How Are Debentures Structured?\n\nAll debentures follow a standard structuring process and have common features. First, a trust indenture is drafted, which is an agreement between the issuing entity and the entity that manages the interests of the bondholders. Next, the coupon rate is decided, which is the rate of interest that the company will pay the debenture holder or investor.

的参与者，无论是作为开发者、矿工还是科学家等等，都有必要深入的了解此次升级所带来的影响，以及如何迅速融入升级后的 yield & defi。本文将系统的阐述 ETH1.0 到 ETH2.0 转型的始末，阐明 ETH2.0 所做出的改变内容，以及帮助参与者无缝过渡到 ETH2.0 生态中。`\n\n\n---\n\n##  01 \n\n### 拂晓：ETH2.0 出现的始末\n\n### 起因：为什么要合并？\n\n以太坊的目标是成为世界级计算机，但就目前而言，以太坊仍然面临交易速度缓慢、手续费高昂、PoW 不环保等诸多问题。\n\n* 首先老生常谈的是上面提到的低扩展性。以太坊网络支持数千个去中心化应用程序，每秒都需要处理大量交易，而采用 PoW 共识机制的以太坊 1.0，每秒只能处理约 10-50 笔交易，远小于 PayPal、Visa 等中心化网络，远无法满足用户对于交易速度的需求。\n* 2020 年，DeFi Summer 促使以太坊网络上的交易量大幅增加，DappRadar 2020 Q3 Dapp 报告中指出，以太坊交易量在 2020 年第三季度猛增至 1195 亿美元，与第二季度相比增长了近 1200%。但随着而来的是网络堵塞，交易费猛增。甚至一度平均交易费用达到 14 美元的高度，刷新历史记录。所以，手续费高昂一直是以太坊被诟病的一个重要的点。包括 EOS 创始人 BM 在内的不少人感叹称：对于大多数正常规模的交易来说，以太坊交易费用太高了。\n* 同时被诟病更多的，是 PoW 的高能耗等问题。PoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、布置矿池、消耗电力来获得相应收益。根据以太坊基金会 2021 年 5 月 18 日对 Digiconomist 研究成果的援引，以太坊矿工目前每年消耗 44.49 太瓦时的电量，相当于一个小型国家一年的耗电量。\n\n### 改变：合并可以带来什么？\n\n此次以太坊的合并，是解决以太坊可扩展性问题第 0 阶段，为后续可能到来的分片做铺垫。所以，这次合并升级并不涉及扩容技术，也不会降低以太坊主网高昂的 Gas 费（这个问题需要分片链与 Layer2 技术相结合才得以有效解决）。在当前阶段，将部署信标链，验证者使用权益证明来创建区块。\n\nThe Merge 后的以太坊，主要会增加以下三大特性：\n\n> **1）更公平**\n\n以太坊基金会认为，PoW（工作量证明）机制下，算力投资等级越高，硬件维护能力越高，这让大的资本相比散户来说，拥有更高的资本回报和优势；相比之下采用 PoS 机制，以太坊可以有效降低验证节点的准入门槛，任何用户只要质押 32 枚 ETH 即可加入验证者队伍（要知道 PoW 矿工的投入要远高于这个数字）。验证者的工作包括创建新区块（即矿工），以及检验新区块（未成为矿工），是由信标链随机分配的，不需要比拼算力，对硬件设备的要求大大降低，支持更多用户参与。只需一台普通的笔记本电脑以及一个可靠的、保持在线的互联网连接即可，所有质押者获得的投资回报率更平等，也由于质押者的数量更多，更去中心化。\n\n> **2）更安全**\n\nPoS 很容易从攻击中恢复。V神在《为什么要进行 PoS 》一文中论述到，在基于 GPU 挖矿的 PoW 中，攻击网络的成本仅仅是租用足够的 GPU 赶超现有矿工的成本，只需要花费少量的成本和时间就可以进行攻击工作。比如 ASIC 芯片挖矿需要 1/3 的持续成本(包括更新迭代硬件、维护、电力)和约 2/3 的资本成本。据计算，需要 487 美元左右。ASIC 以高昂的集中化成本提高安全级别，但这种高成本防范攻击使得整个网络趋于中心化，因为矿工加入的门槛也变高了。而在权益证明中，几乎全部是资本成本，即运行节点的成本。随着质押率的提高，攻击成本预计非常高，V神个人预计这个数字最终会上升到 10000 美元左右。\n\n在 PoW 网络中，如果遭到 51% 攻击，唯一的应对措施就是 “等到攻击者主动撤销攻击\"。但这忽略了一种更危险的攻击可能性，这种攻击叫做产卵营攻击(Pawn Camping Attack)，攻击者一次又一次地进行攻击，目的很明确，就是为了使整条链瘫痪。PoS 的情况会好很多。对于某些类型的 51% 攻击(特别是回滚最终确定的区块)，在权益证明中有一个内置的惩罚机制，通过这个机制，攻击者的大部分质押(并不包括其他人的)将被自动销毁。\n\n同时，此次合并升级也正是为最后的分片链上线做准备。分片链的安全性将影响着整个以太坊网络，所以只有当安全性得到有效保障后，才能逐渐上线，分片链的验证者将由信标链随机分配，因为是随机的，所以一条分片链上的验证者难以进行串谋作恶，据以太坊团队介绍，该作恶的可能性小于万亿分之一，分片链的安全得以保障。\n\n> **3）更节能**\n\nPoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、电力和矿池，这导致了对于能源的较大消耗，转化成 PoS 机制后，能够节约超过 95% 的能源消耗，原因是以太坊给质押者的收益只需要消耗少量的网络和电力费用。在全球减碳环保的大背景下，选择不消耗任何能源的 PoS 机制更符合以太坊网络可持续性发展的愿景。\n\n\n---\n\n# 02\n\n### 深入：从矿工到验证者\n\n### 验证者：ETH2.0 中的矿工\n\n在 ETH2.0 中，“矿工”将被“验证者” (validators) 取代，这些验证者需要将 ETH 存入某个以太坊智能合约中 (这一过程称为“质押”(staking))。验证者质押的 ETH 将作为抵押品，以激励他们正确地完成验证工作。不履行验证工作 (比如因为离线) 或进行恶意行为的验证者，将导致其质押的 ETH 的一部分被销毁。另一方面，如果验证者行为得当，那么将会获得 ETH 奖励。\n\n事实上，一个交易被敲定的过程要求验证者进行的“证明”(attestations) 实际上要比上文阐述的要更复杂一些。有两种类型的证明：一种是 LMD GHOST 投票，用于证明区块链的链头；第二种最为重要，是用于对两个检查点进行证明的 FFG 投票 (对区块链进行合理化和最终敲定)。如果验证者接收到的区块是有效的，那么验证者将对区块进行“证明”，实际上就是投票支持将该区块添加到区块链中。一个节点将不定期地被要求提议一个新区块，其他验证者将“证明”该区块。当区块链有多个分叉时，只有那条在其历史上积累了最多“证明” 的链才是正确的区块链。\n\n所有验证者都会对每个检查点进行 FFG 投票，而只有一个随机选中的验证者子集在每个 slot (将区块添加到信标链的机会，每 12 秒出现一次)进行 LMD GHOST 投票。\n\n此外，验证者还将不定期地参与到某个同步委员会 (sync committee) 中，同步委员会是一个由随机选择的 512 名验证者组成的小组，这些被随机选中的验证者将对区块头 (block headers) 进行签名，这样轻客户端就可以检索这些被验证过的区块，而无需访问整条历史链或整个验证者集。\n\n### 验证者参与结果：质押奖励、惩罚和罚没\n\n> **1）奖励** \n\n验证者需要质押的 ETH 用于作为“抵押品”，以激励验证者的诚实行为。随着验证者因为参与到保护网络中而获得奖励，这些被质押的 ETH 将随着时间的推移而增加。当确定验证者的投票合法并有效、且与大多数其他验证者一致时，那么验证者就会获得证明奖励。\n\n当验证者被选中作为“区块提议者”(block proposer) 时，如果其提议的区块被“敲定”， 那么该验证者也将获得奖励。区块提议者也可以通过将有关其他验证者行为不当的证明打包进自己提议的区块中，从而增加自己获得的奖励。\n\n> **2）惩罚**\n\n验证者可能受到的“惩罚”是以各种机制的形式来销毁一部分验证者质押的 ETH。当验证者未能提交一个 FFG 投票、提交延迟了或者提交了错误的 FFG 投票时，都会受到证明惩罚 (attestation penalties)。验证者余额被削减的数额，等同于如果他们提交正确的证明而本可以获得的奖励数额。这意味着，一个诚实但“懒惰”的验证者，他因为错过了证明而遭受到的最大惩罚，就是损失他如果以完美的方式进行证明时本可以获得的奖励金额的 3/4。注意，如果不参与 LMD GHOST 验证是不会受到惩罚的，只是无法得到相应的奖励。 \n  \n 此外，当验证者被分配至“同步委员会”(sync committee) 时，如果该验证者未能签名区块，那么其受到的惩罚将等同于如果他成功地签名区块时本可以获得的 ETH 价值。\n\n> **3）罚没**\n\n罚没 (slashing) 是一种更严重的行为，这会导致验证者被强制从网络中移除，并导致相关的 ETH 质押金损失。\n\n如果检测到严重的违规操作操作，验证者就会罚没。这意味着相当于其质押的 ETH 的 1/64 (最高可达 0.5 ETH) 将立即被销毁，然后进行一个为期 36 天的移除。在此期间，验证者的质押金将逐渐被削减；且在这段期间的中间点 (第18天)，该验证者还将受到额外的惩罚，惩罚大小将与此次罚没事件发生之前的 36 天内所有被罚没的验证者的 ETH 质押总额成比例。\n\n这意味着，当更多的验证者被罚没时，此次罚没的量级将会增加。最大的罚没是所有被罚没的验证者的全部有效余额 (比如，如果有大量验证者被罚没，那么某个验证者可能损失其全部的质押金)。\n\n\n---\n\n#  03\n\n### 浅出：不同参与者如何玩转 ETH2.0\n\n### 对开发者：无缝过渡\n\n在以太坊上工作的开发人员可以“高枕无忧”，因为用于合并前后架构的通用 API 以及对现有组件（如以太坊执行客户端 Geth）的重用，将确保无缝过渡的不间断开发体验。这意味着现有应用程序的返工率很低甚至没有。\n\nPoW 和 PoS 接口的相似之处意味着无需更改 API。利用现有组件还可以确保无需重写智能合约或 dapp 或迁移基础设施。对于依赖随机操作码的 Dapp，可能需要更新一些基础设施。如果您是以太坊开发人员并希望提前开始测试您的 Dapp 和基础设施，鼓励使用最近推出的 Kiln 测试网来进行。增加的客户端选择和灵活性将允许开发人员混合和匹配以满足他们的需求，例如在执行层使用轻量级客户端和在共识层使用重量级 Staking 客户端。\n\n迁移到 PoS 还意味着更可预测的区块时间和费用，这将减少在设计 12 秒区块时间和使用 EIP-1559 建立的 base 费用的高流量解决方案时的不确定性。\n\n### 对普通 Web3 玩家：质押挖矿\n\n在完全切换共识后，以太坊的增发率会低至 2% 以下，增发会远低于目前。PoS 共识下的挖矿和理财比较相近，长期稳定下来的年化收益率预期在 10% 以下，传统矿工一年回本、两年翻倍的模式将不复存在。\n\n可能很多玩家会说，质押 32 ETH 的门槛太高，会导致大部分 PoW 矿工无法参与其中。常言道，有求必有应，需求驱动供给的产生，诸如 Lido 等 Dapp 可以从门槛上进一步降低参与者的准入条件。如今 Lido 的 TVL 已达 195 亿美元，在 DeFi 项目 TVL 总榜中稳居第二，仅次于 Curve。\n\n\n---\n\n **最后**\n\n根据 Bankless 以太坊第一季度报告，仅在 EIP1559 燃烧情况下，ETH 通胀率从 1.10% 下降 至 0.51%。按照目前的质押率，仅考虑转换 PoS，通胀率为 0.5-1% 左右，低于比特币的通胀率。两者叠加，ETH 既有可能进入通缩状态，将利好 ETH 价格。\n\n合并过程或许不会一切顺利。首先合并后 PoW 矿机节点将全部下线，许多矿工可能会在合并之前退出网络，合并发生后也极有可能出现分叉。其次，如此重大的技术升级，也可能出现服务错误和黑客攻击。\n\n在过去几年中，我们看到以太坊引领了 DeFi、NFT 等创新趋势，同时以太坊在提升性能方面从未停止脚步，PoS 合并会是这一进程中的重要一步。在元宇宙叙事的 Web3.0 下，以太坊是否能保持龙头公链的地位，建立一个更强壮的体验与生态，引入更多用户的参与，期待以太坊生态会有更好的表现。\n\n\n---\n\n**参考**\n\nhttps://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/state-of-ethereum-q1-2022?s=r \n

{"id": "PpgPWlOn8gH0YVi-l_LtWjqsigaEj_kRbd8ReppRPHU", "title": "Derivative", "body": "## What Is a Derivative?\n\nThe term derivative refers to a type of financial contract whose value is dependent on an [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp), group of assets, or benchmark. A derivative is set between two or more parties that can trade on an exchange or [over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC). These contracts can be used to trade any number of assets and carry their own risks. Prices for derivatives derive from fluctuations in the underlying asset.

Traders use derivatives to access specific [markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp) and trade different assets. The most common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds, [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), [currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp), interest rates, and market indexes. Contract values depend on changes in the prices of the underlying asset.\n\nDerivatives can be used to hedge a position, speculate on the directional movement of an underlying asset, or give leverage to holdings. These assets are commonly traded on exchanges or [over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) and are purchased through brokerages. The [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp) (CME) is among the world's largest derivatives exchanges.1\n\nOTC-traded derivatives generally have a greater possibility of [counterparty risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp), which is the danger that one of the parties involved in the transaction might [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp). These contracts trade between two private parties and are unregulated. To hedge this risk, the investor could purchase a currency derivative to lock in a specific exchange rate. Derivatives that could be used to hedge this kind of risk include [currency futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyfuture.asp) and [currency swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyswap.asp).\n\nExchange-traded derivatives are standardized and more heavily regulated than those that are traded over the counter.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nDerivatives were originally used to ensure balanced exchange rates for internationally traded goods. International traders needed a system to account for the differing values of national [currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp).\n\nAssume a European investor has investment accounts that are all denominated in euros (EUR). Let's say they purchase shares of a U.S. company through a U.S. exchange using U.S. dollars (USD). This means they are now exposed to [exchange rate risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreignexchangerisk.asp) while holding that stock. Exchange rate risk is the threat that the value of the euro will increase in relation to the USD. If this happens, any profits the investor realizes upon selling the stock become less valuable when they are converted into euros.\n\nA [speculator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculator.asp) who expects the euro to appreciate compared to the dollar could profit by using a derivative that rises in value with the euro. When using derivatives to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset, the investor does not need to have a holding or [portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) presence in the underlying asset.\n\n### \n\n*Many derivative instruments are leveraged, which means a small amount of capital is required to have an interest in a large amount of value in the underlying asset.*\n\n## Types of Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are now based on a wide variety of [transactions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp) and have many more uses. There are even derivatives based on weather data, such as the amount of rain or the number of sunny days in a region.\n\nThere are many different types of derivatives that can be used for [risk management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp), [speculation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp), and leveraging a position. The derivatives market is one that continues to grow, offering products to fit nearly any need or [risk tolerance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp). The most common types of derivatives are futures, forwards, swaps, and options.\n\n### Futures\n\nA [futures contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp), or simply futures, is an agreement between two parties for the purchase and delivery of an asset at an agreed-upon price at a future date. Futures are standardized contracts that trade on an exchange. Traders use a futures contract to hedge their risk or speculate on the price of an underlying asset. The parties involved are obligated to fulfill a commitment to buy or sell the underlying asset.\n\nFor example, say that on Nov. 6, 2021, Company A buys a futures contract for oil at a price of $62.22 per barrel that expires Dec. 19, 2021. The company does this because it needs oil in December and is concerned that the price will rise before the company needs to buy. Buying an oil futures contract hedges the company's risk because the seller is obligated to deliver oil to Company A for $62.22 per barrel once the contract expires. Assume oil prices rise to $80 per barrel by Dec. 19, 2021. Company A can accept delivery of the oil from the seller of the futures contract, but if it no longer needs the oil, it can also sell the contract before expiration and keep the profits.\n\nIn this example, both the futures buyer and seller hedge their risk. Company A needed oil in the future and wanted to offset the risk that the price may rise in December with a long position in an oil futures contract. The seller could be an oil company concerned about falling oil prices and wanted to eliminate that risk by selling or [shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) a futures contract that fixed the price it would get in December.\n\nIt is also possible that one or both of the parties are speculators with the opposite opinion about the direction of December oil. In that case, one might benefit from the contract, and one might not. Take, for example, the futures contract for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil that trades on the CME and represents 1,000 barrels of oil. If the price of oil rose from $62.22 to $80 per barrel, the trader with the long position—the buyer—in the futures contract would have profited $17,780 \\[($80 - $62.22) x 1,000 = $17,780\\].2 The trader with the short position—the seller—in the contract would have a loss of $17,780.\n\n### Cash Settlements of Futures\n\nNot all futures contracts are settled at expiration by delivering the underlying asset. If both parties in a futures contract are speculating investors or [traders](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0312/how-to-become-a-day-trader.aspx), it is unlikely that either of them would want to make arrangements for the delivery of several barrels of crude oil. Speculators can end their obligation to purchase or deliver the underlying commodity by closing (unwinding) their contract before expiration with an offsetting contract.\n\nMany derivatives are in fact cash-settled, which means that the gain or loss in the trade is simply an accounting cash flow to the trader's brokerage account. Futures contracts that are cash-settled include many interest rate futures, [stock index futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfutures.asp), and more unusual instruments like volatility futures or weather futures. \n \n\n### Forwards\n\n[Forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp) or forwards are similar to futures, but they do not trade on an exchange. These contracts only trade over-the-counter. When a forward contract is created, the buyer and seller may customize the terms, size, and settlement process. As OTC products, forward contracts carry a greater degree of counterparty risk for both parties.\n\nCounterparty risks are a type of [credit risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) in that the parties may not be able to live up to the obligations outlined in the contract. If one party becomes insolvent, the other party may have no recourse and could lose the value of its position.\n\nOnce created, the parties in a forward contract can offset their position with other counterparties, which can increase the potential for counterparty risks as more traders become involved in the same contract.\n\n### Swaps\n\n[Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp) are another common type of derivative, often used to exchange one kind of cash flow with another. For example, a trader might use an [interest rate swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp) to switch from a variable interest rate loan to a fixed interest rate loan, or vice versa.\n\nImagine that Company XYZ borrows $1,000,000 and pays a [variable interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableinterestrate.asp) on the loan that is currently 6%. XYZ may be concerned about rising interest rates that will increase the costs of this loan or encounter a lender that is reluctant to extend more credit while the company has this variable rate risk.\n\nAssume XYZ creates a swap with Company QRS, which is willing to exchange the payments owed on the variable-rate loan for the payments owed on a fixed-rate loan of 7%. That means that XYZ will pay 7% to QRS on its $1,000,000 principal, and QRS will pay XYZ 6% interest on the same principal. At the beginning of the swap, XYZ will just pay QRS the 1% difference between the two [swap rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swaprate.asp).\n\nIf interest rates fall so that the variable rate on the original loan is now 5%, Company XYZ will have to pay Company QRS the 2% difference on the loan. If interest rates rise to 8%, then QRS would have to pay XYZ the 1% difference between the two swap rates. Regardless of how interest rates change, the swap has achieved XYZ's original objective of turning a variable-rate loan into a [fixed-rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp) loan.\n\nSwaps can also be constructed to exchange currency exchange rate risk or the risk of default on a loan or cash flows from other business activities. Swaps related to the cash flows and potential defaults of mortgage bonds are an extremely popular kind of derivative. In fact, they've been a bit too popular in the past. It was the counterparty risk of swaps like this that eventually spiraled into the [credit crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-crisis.asp) of 2008.\n\n### Options\n\nAn [options contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) is similar to a futures contract in that it is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date for a specific price. The key difference between options and futures is that with an option, the buyer is not obliged to exercise their agreement to buy or sell. It is an opportunity only, not an obligation, as futures are. As with futures, options may be used to hedge or speculate on the price of the underlying asset.\n\nIn terms of timing your right to buy or sell, it depends on the \"style\" of the option. An American option allows holders to exercise the option rights at any time before and including the day of expiration. A European option can be executed only on the day of expiration. Most stocks and exchange-traded funds have American-style options while equity indices, including the S&P 500, have European-style options.\n\n \n \n\nImagine an investor owns 100 shares of a stock worth $50 per share. They believe the stock's value will rise in the future. However, this investor is concerned about potential risks and decides to hedge their position with an option. The investor could buy a put option that gives them the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock for $50 per share—known as the [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)—until a specific day in the future—known as the [expiration date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp).\n\nAssume the stock falls in value to $40 per share by expiration and the put option buyer decides to exercise their option and sell the stock for the original strike price of $50 per share. If the put option cost the investor $200 to purchase, then they have only lost the cost of the option because the strike price was equal to the price of the stock when they originally bought the put. A strategy like this is called a [protective put](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protective-put.asp) because it hedges the stock's downside risk.\n\nAlternatively, assume an investor doesn't own the stock currently worth $50 per share. They believe its value will rise over the next month. This investor could buy a call option that gives them the right to buy the stock for $50 before or at expiration. Assume this call option cost $200 and the stock rose to $60 before expiration. The buyer can now exercise their option and buy a stock worth $60 per share for the $50 strike price for an initial profit of $10 per share. A call option represents 100 shares, so the real profit is $1,000 less the cost of the option—the [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-premium.asp)—and any brokerage commission fees.\n\nIn both examples, the sellers are obligated to fulfill their side of the contract if the buyers choose to exercise the contract. However, if a stock's price is above the strike price at expiration, the put will be worthless and the seller (the option writer) gets to keep the premium as the option expires. If the stock's price is below the strike price at expiration, the call will be worthless and the call seller will keep the premium.\n\n Melissa Ling {Copyright} Investopedia, 2019.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of Derivatives\n\n### Advantages\n\nAs the above examples illustrate, derivatives can be a useful tool for businesses and investors alike. They provide a way to do the following:\n\n* Lock in prices\n* Hedge against unfavorable movements in rates\n* Mitigate risks\n\nThese pluses can often come for a limited cost.\n\nDerivatives can also often be purchased on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp), which means traders use borrowed funds to purchase them. This makes them even less expensive.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\nDerivatives are difficult to value because they are based on the price of another asset. The risks for OTC derivatives include counterparty risks that are difficult to predict or value. Most derivatives are also sensitive to the following:\n\n* Changes in the amount of time to expiration\n* The cost of holding the underlying asset\n* Interest rates\n\nThese variables make it difficult to perfectly match the value of a derivative with the underlying asset.\n\nSince the derivative has no intrinsic value (its value comes only from the underlying asset), it is vulnerable to [market sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp) and market risk. It is possible for supply and demand factors to cause a derivative's price and its [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) to rise and fall, regardless of what is happening with the price of the underlying asset.\n\nFinally, derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, and using leverage cuts both ways. While it can increase the rate of return, it also makes losses mount more quickly.\n\nPros\n\n* Lock in prices\n* Hedge against risk\n* Can be leveraged\n* Diversify portfolio\n\nCons\n\n* Hard to value\n* Subject to counterparty default (if OTC)\n* Complex to understand\n* Sensitive to supply and demand factors\n\n## What Are Derivatives?\n\nDerivatives are securities whose value is dependent on or derived from an underlying asset. For example, an [oil futures contract](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/040615/introduction-trading-oil-futures.asp) is a type of derivative whose value is based on the market price of oil. Derivatives have become increasingly popular in recent decades, with the [total value of derivatives outstanding](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052715/how-big-derivatives-market.asp) currently estimated at over $600 trillion.3\n\n## What Are Some Examples of Derivatives?\n\nCommon examples of derivatives include futures contracts, options contracts, and [credit default swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp). Beyond these, there is a vast quantity of derivative contracts tailored to meet the needs of a diverse range of counterparties. In fact, since many derivatives are traded over the counter (OTC), they can in principle be infinitely customized.\n\n## What Are the Main Benefits and Risks of Derivatives?\n\nDerivatives can be a very convenient way to achieve financial goals. For example, a company that wants to hedge against its exposure to commodities can do so by buying or selling energy derivatives such as crude oil futures. Similarly, a company could hedge its currency risk by purchasing currency forward contracts.\n\n \n \n\nDerivatives can also help investors leverage their positions, such as by buying equities through stock options rather than shares. The main drawbacks of derivatives include counterparty risk, the inherent risks of leverage, and the fact that complicated webs of derivative contracts can lead to [systemic risks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systemic-risk.asp).\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "SvBM-6DCQ_ugCAuriz0p0pFSRsH-sjOwavncWdYSOao", "title": "Dilution", "body": "## What Is Dilution?\n\nDilution occurs when a company issues new shares that result in a decrease in existing stockholders' ownership percentage of that company. Stock dilution can also occur when holders of [stock options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp), such as company employees, or holders of other optionable securities [exercise](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp) their options. When the number of shares outstanding increases, each existing stockholder owns a smaller, or diluted, percentage of the company, making each share less valuable.\n\nA share of stock represents [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) ownership in that company. When a firm's board of directors decides to take their company public, usually through an initial public offering ([IPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp)), they authorize the number of shares that will be initially offered. This amount of outstanding stock is commonly referred to as the \"[float](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-difference-between-shares-outstanding-and-floating-stock.asp).\" If that company later issues additional stock (often called [secondary offerings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp)) they have increased the float and therefore diluted their stock: the shareholders who bought the original IPO now have a smaller ownership stake in the company than they did prior to the new shares being issued.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Dilution is the reduction in shareholders' equity positions due to the issuance or creation of new shares.\n* Dilution also reduces a company's earnings per share (EPS), which can have a negative impact on share prices.\n* Dilution can occur when a firm raises additional equity capital, though existing shareholders are usually disadvantaged.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 10 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:10\n\n#### Dilution\n\n## Understanding Dilution\n\nDilution is simply a case of cutting the equity \"cake\" into more pieces. There will be more pieces but each will be smaller. So, you will still get your piece of the cake only that it will be a smaller proportion of the total than you had been expecting, which is often not desired.\n\nWhile it primarily affects equity ownership positions, dilution also reduces the company's earnings per share ([EPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp), or net income divided by the float), which often depresses stock prices in the market. For this reason, many public companies publish estimates of both non-diluted and diluted EPS, which is essentially a \"what-if-scenario\" for investors in the case new shares are issued. Diluted EPS assumes that potentially [dilutive](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102714/what-are-differences-between-dilutive-securities-and-antidilutive-securities.asp) securities have already been converted to outstanding shares.\n\nShare dilution may happen any time a company raises additional equity capital, as newly created shares are issued to new investors. The potential upside of raising capital in this way is that the funds the company receives from selling additional shares can improve the company's profitability and growth prospects, and by extension the value of its stock.\n\nUnderstandably, share dilution is not often viewed favorably by existing shareholders, and companies sometimes initiate [share repurchase](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharerepurchase.asp) programs to help curb the effects of dilution. Note that [stock splits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.asp) do not create dilution. In situations where a company splits its stock, current investors receive additional shares while the price of the shares is adjusted accordingly, keeping their percentage ownership in the company static.\n\n## General Example of Dilution\n\nSuppose a company has issued 100 shares to 100 individual shareholders. Each [shareholder](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) owns 1% of the company. If the company then has a secondary offering and issues 100 new shares to 100 more shareholders, each shareholder only owns 0.5% of the company. The smaller ownership percentage also diminishes each investor's voting power.\n\n## Real-World Example of Dilution\n\nOften times a public company disseminates its intention to issue new shares, thereby diluting its current pool of equity long before it actually does. This allows investors, both new and old, to plan accordingly. For example, MGT Capital filed a proxy statement on July 8, 2016, that outlined a stock option plan for the newly appointed CEO, John McAfee. Additionally, the statement disseminated the structure of recent company acquisitions, purchased with a combination of cash and stock.\n\nBoth the executive stock option plan as well as the acquisitions are expected to dilute the current pool of outstanding shares. Further, the proxy statement had a proposal for the issuance of newly authorized shares, which suggests the company expects more dilution in the near-term.\n\n## Dilution Protection\n\nShareholders typically resist dilution as it devalues their existing equity. [Dilution protection](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution-protection.asp) refers to contractual provisions that limit or outright prevent an investor's stake in a company from being reduced in later [funding rounds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downround.asp). The dilution protection feature kicks in if the actions of the company will decrease the investor's percentage claim on assets of the company.\n\nFor example, if an investor's stake is 20%, and the company is going to hold an additional funding round, the company must offer discounted shares to the investor to at least partially make up for the dilution of the overall ownership stake. Dilution protection provisions are generally found in [venture capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp) funding agreements.

This allows an investor to determine what financial activities are contributing the most to the changes in ROE. An investor can use analysis like this to compare the [operational efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operationalefficiency.asp) of two similar firms. Managers can use DuPont analysis to identify strengths or weaknesses that should be addressed.1\n\nThere are three major financial metrics that drive return on equity (ROE): [operating efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operationalefficiency.asp), asset use efficiency, and financial leverage. Operating efficiency is represented by [net profit margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net_margin.asp) or net income divided by total sales or revenue. Asset use efficiency is measured by the [asset turnover ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetturnover.asp). [Leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) is measured by the equity multiplier, which is equal to average assets divided by average equity.\n\n## DuPont Analysis Components\n\nDuPont analysis breaks ROE into its constituent components to determine which of these factors are most responsible for changes in ROE.\n\n### Net Profit Margin\n\nThe net profit margin is the ratio of bottom line profits compared to total revenue or total sales. This is one of the most basic measures of profitability.\n\nOne way to think about the net margin is to imagine a store that sells a single product for $1.00. After the costs associated with buying inventory, maintaining a location, paying employees, taxes, interest, and other expenses, the store owner keeps $0.15 in profit from each unit sold. That means the owner's profit margin is 15%, which can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Profit Margin} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Net Income} }{ \\\\text{Revenue} } = \\\\frac{ \\\\$0.15 }{ \\\\$1.00 } = 15\\\\% \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Profit Margin=RevenueNet Income​=$1.00$0.15​=15%​﻿\n\nThe profit margin can be improved if costs for the owner were reduced or if prices were raised, which can have a large impact on ROE. This is one of the reasons that a company's stock will experience high levels of [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) when management makes a change to its [guidance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guidance.asp) for future margins, costs, and prices.\n\n### Asset Turnover Ratio\n\nThe asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) to generate revenue. Imagine a company had $100 of assets, and it made $1,000 of total revenue last year. The assets generated 10 times their value in total revenue, which is the same as the asset turnover ratio and can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Revenue} }{ \\\\text{Average Assets} } = \\\\frac{ \\\\$1,000 }{ \\\\$100 } = 10 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Asset Turnover Ratio=Average AssetsRevenue​=$100$1,000​=10​\n\nA normal asset turnover ratio will vary from one industry group to another. For example, a discount retailer or grocery store will generate a lot of revenue from its assets with a small margin, which will make the asset turnover ratio very large. On the other hand, a utility company owns very expensive [fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp) relative to its revenue, which will result in an asset turnover ratio that is much lower than that of a retail firm.2\n\nThe ratio can be helpful when comparing two companies that are very similar. Because average assets include components like [inventory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp), changes in this ratio can signal that sales are slowing down or speeding up earlier than it would show up in other financial measures. If a company's asset turnover rises, its ROE will improve.\n\n### Financial Leverage\n\nFinancial leverage, or the equity multiplier, is an indirect analysis of a company's use of debt to finance its assets. Assume a company has $1,000 of assets and $250 of owner's equity. The [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) equation will tell you that the company also has $750 in debt (assets - liabilities = equity). If the company borrows more to purchase assets, the ratio will continue to rise. The accounts used to calculate financial leverage are both on the balance sheet, so analysts will divide average assets by average equity rather than the balance at the end of the period, as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Financial Leverage} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Average Assets} }{ \\\\text{Average Equity} } = \\\\frac{ \\\\$1,000 }{ \\\\$250 } = 4 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Financial Leverage=Average EquityAverage Assets​=$250$1,000​=4​﻿\n\nMost companies should use debt with equity to fund operations and growth. Not using any leverage could put the company at a disadvantage compared with its peers. However, using too much [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp) in order to increase the financial leverage ratio—and therefore increase ROE—can create disproportionate risks.\n\n## Example of DuPont Analysis Use\n\nAn investor has been watching two similar companies, SuperCo and Gear Inc., that have recently been improving their return on equity compared to the rest of their [peer group](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-group.asp). This could be a good thing if the two companies are making better use of assets or improving profit margins.\n\nIn order to decide which company is a better opportunity, the investor decides to use DuPont analysis to determine what each company is doing to improve its ROE and whether that improvement is sustainable.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020\n\nAs you can see in the table, SuperCo improved its profit margins by increasing net income and reducing its total assets. SuperCo's changes improved its profit margin and asset turnover. The investor can deduce from the information that SuperCo also reduced some of its debt since average equity remained the same.\n\nLooking closely at Gear Inc., the investor can see that the entire change in ROE was due to an increase in financial leverage. This means Gear Inc. borrowed more money, which reduced average equity. The investor is concerned because the additional borrowings didn't change the company's net income, revenue, or profit margin, which means the leverage may not be adding any real value to the firm.\n\nOr, as a real-life example, consider Walmart Stores (NYSE: [WMT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=wmt)). Walmart has a net income over the [trailing twelve months](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) of $4.75 billion, revenue of $559.2 billion, assets of $252.5 billion, and shareholders' equity of $80.9 billion.3\n\nThe company's profit margin is 0.8%, or $4.75 billion / $559.2 billion. Its asset turnover is 2.22, or $559.2 billion / $252.5 billion. The financial leverage (or equity multiplier) is 3.12, or $252.5 billion / $80.9 billion. Thus, its return or equity (ROE) is 5.5%, or 0.8% x 2.22 x 3.12.\n\n## DuPont Analysis vs. ROE\n\nThe return on equity (ROE) metric is net income divided by shareholders’ equity. The Dupont analysis is still the ROE, just an expanded version. The ROE calculation alone reveals how well a company utilizes capital from shareholders.\n\nWith a Dupont analysis, investors and analysts can dig into what drives changes in ROE, or why an ROE is considered high or low. That is, a Dupont analysis can help deduce whether its profitability, use of assets, or debt that’s driving ROE.\n\n## Limitations of Using DuPont Analysis\n\nThe biggest drawback of the DuPont analysis is that, while expansive, it still relies on accounting equations and data that can be manipulated. Plus, even with its comprehensiveness, the Dupont analysis lacks context as to why the individual ratios are high or low, or even whether they should be considered high or low at all.4\n\n## What Does DuPont Analysis Tell You?\n\nDuPont analysis is a useful technique used to decompose the different drivers of return on equity (ROE) for a business. This allows an investor to determine what financial activities are contributing the most to the changes in ROE. An investor can use analysis like this to compare the operational efficiency of two similar firms.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between 3-Step and 5-Step DuPont Analysis?\n\nThere are two versions of DuPont analysis, one utilizing decomposition of ROE via 3 steps and another utilizing 5 steps. The three-step equation breaks up ROE into three very important components:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{ROE} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Net Income} }{ \\\\text{Sales} } \\\\times \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Sales} }{ \\\\text{Assets} } \\\\times \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Assets} }{ \\\\text{Shareholders' Equity} } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​ROE=SalesNet Income​×AssetsSales​×Shareholders’ EquityAssets​​\n\nThe five-step version instead is:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{ROE} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{EBT} }{ \\\\text{S} } \\\\times \\\\frac{ \\\\text{S} }{ \\\\text{A} } \\\\times \\\\frac{ \\\\text{A} }{ \\\\text{E} } \\\\times ( 1 - \\\\text{TR} ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EBT} = \\\\text{Earnings before tax} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{S} = \\\\text{Sales} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{A} = \\\\text{Assets} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{E} = \\\\text{Equity} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{TR} = \\\\text{Tax rate} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​ROE=SEBT​×AS​×EA​×(1−TR)where:EBT=Earnings before taxS=SalesA=AssetsE=EquityTR=Tax rate​\n\n## Why Is It Called DuPont Analysis?\n\nIn the 1920s, the American chemicals and manufacturing giant, DuPont Corporation, created an internal management tool to better understand where its operating efficiency was coming from and where it was falling short. By breaking down ROE into a more complex equation, DuPont analysis shows the causes of shifts in this number.5\n\n## What Are Some Limitations of Using DuPont analysis?\n\nWhile DuPont analysis can be a very helpful tool for managers, analysts, and investors, it is not without its weaknesses. The expansive nature of the DuPont equations means that it requires several inputs. As with any calculation, the results are only as good as the accuracy of the inputs. DuPont analysis utilizes data from a company's income statement and balance sheet, some of which may not be entirely accurate. Even if the data used for calculations are reliable, there are still additional potential problems, such as the difficulty of determining the [relative values](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relative-value.asp) of ratios as good or bad compared to industry norms. Seasonal factors, depending on the industry, can also be an important consideration, since these factors can distort ratios. Some companies always carry a higher level of inventory at certain times of the year, for example. Different [accounting practices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-practice.asp) between companies can also make accurate comparisons difficult.", "timestamp": 1654658312, "digest": "CHdrbCf6cbwhaLHTgNH7qB7X1zXipRF2JRCb8znkD48", "contributor": "0x7f0c19D5539360531fE37Aef7070E746846D0432"}

让我们称之为熊市作业。\n\n## 许多输家和一些赢家\n\n随着 DeFi 的老化，我们已经看到庞氏游戏成熟并变得更加复杂/隐蔽，掩盖了旨在剥夺交易者宝贵资金的多层经济炼金术。无论是 DeFi 遥远过去的食品农场，还是 DeFi 相对较近的过去的 OHM 分叉，还是现在难以平息的长期持续的庞氏骗局，DeFi 都是建立在与经济结构混合的赌场式趋势的背后那会让伯尼麦道夫从他的坟墓里跳出来。\n\n在 UST 和 Anchor Protocol 倒闭后，TVL 从 Terra 中消失，让以太坊在 DeFi 上拥有大约 65% 的主导地位，而币安智能链和 Tron 并没有紧随其后。这是如何发生的，为什么尽管以太坊的汽油费和 Solana、Avalanche 和 Polygon 等替代 L1 的竞争激烈，但资金仍继续流回以太坊？答案不是那么简单，而事实是我没有太多答案。我最好的猜测涉及到 DeFi 是在以太坊上创建的，并且或多或少注定要在链上度过其生命周期以击败所有其他链。以太坊已经看到其像 Arbitrum、Optimism、zkSync 和 Starknet 这样的 L2 越来越受欢迎和使用，这在一定程度上说明了 DeFi TVL 最终仍然 100% 集中在互联网赌场的几乎不可避免的可能性。\n\nDeFi TVL 目前由一些相当有信誉的协议代表（参见：提到的前五名），如果你只停留在前 25 名左右，看起来很负责任。过去，我们开始看到真正的庞氏骗局出现。如果您在过去几周内搜索过任何 defillama，您会注意到许多协议正在经历极端的 TVL 波动。一天流入 25%，下一天流出 -40%，过去 7 天流出 -65% - 随便你说，DeFi 已经做到了。虽然那些希望长期（可能）赚取收益的人缺乏机会，但目前的情况看起来相当黯淡。如果幸运的话，许多协议的稳定收益率在 3-6% 范围内，在连续几个月定期运行超过两位数之后。如果我们不能为我们珍贵的支持稳定币提供流动性，\n\n我相信 DeFi 将在明年向以下几个类别倾斜：\n\n借贷\n\n结构化产品\n\n衍生品\n\n跨链自助餐\n\n“但是 Knower，你可以借用 Aave 或 Compound 之类的协议，然后——”\n\n不，这是不同的。如果我们想从大男孩那里吸引机构资本，我们必须向大男孩推销自己。\n\n## 借贷\n\n我认为我们将看到 Maple、Goldfinch 和 Clearpool 等协议的 TVL 大幅增长，因为在不幸的 Terra 事件之后，更多加密原生协议之间的信任度下降。是的，我是说 DeFi 将变得不那么去中心化。这很糟糕，但如果你有一个“玻璃半满”的视角，它可能会很好。Maple 在 TVL 强度、代币价格和相对引人注目（我已经编造的指标）方面已经超越了许多同行，而大量协议一直在争先恐后地收回他们宝贵的 TVL。Goldfinch 和 Clearpool 也是如此，尽管 Maple 做得更好，就这么简单。顺便说一句，您仍然可以在 Maple 上获得两位数的稳定收益。\n\n借贷是巨大的，因为许多人有很多钱，但不能总是使用它——用你的抵押品借贷是一种方法。Aave 和 Compound 的增长是因为加密鲸鱼获得更多资金的内在需求，存款激励措施首先获得了这些神奇的资金。这种模式在很大程度上促成了 DeFi 的当前状态，因为 99.9% 的协议必须首先启动 LP 激励措施才能吸引任何牵引力/注意力/存款。这并不总是一件坏事，但它确实可以防止加密货币中的大量垃圾仅仅因为可以经常进行的农场和转储游戏而被取出。DeFi 目前并没有真正的主要用例，除了让一些人赚钱，一些人赚很多钱，还有很多人根本没有钱。这可能是由于无常损失、糟糕的代币经济学、缺乏 PMF 或三者的某种组合，以及其他更多的定性因素。哦，TradFi 拥有数万亿美元，而其中只有 1% 的追随者进入 DeFi，我们都会变得富有。继续。\n\n## 结构性产品\n\n结构化产品是一个有趣的故事，主要是因为迄今为止它们在 DeFi 中的营销方式。DeFi 的全部内容就是收益率，而结构化产品从根本上就是为了提供高收益而设计的，只是更难让它们坚持下去。当然，您可以跳上其中一个协议，并看到 ETH cc 或 csp 的理论收益率为 42% - 但是为什么要在如此动荡的市场中这样做，如果它下跌或限制您的价格，您有义务购买大幅上涨的上行空间？是的，我知道这些产品主要用于对冲，但加密仍处于其生命周期的早期阶段，随着时间的推移这些将变得更加重要。不管它们的效用如何，可以看出它们确实在当前市场上占有一席之地。如果您无法从其他任何地方获得所需的收益，结构化产品可能会成为您的朋友。\n\n也许我们不会看到大量过度退化的结构化产品策略，但我们很有可能会看到。如果加密进入下一个周期，结构化产品仍然存在（厌倦了每十秒输入一次结构化产品），那么将有很多机会将庞氏经济学和 theta 组合成数百万散户投资者的包装毁灭性武器。想象一下，如果 DeFi 创始人在下个月以 > 2000 万美元 && < 2500 万美元的价格出售他的项目，同时出售项目代币上的 CSP，希望大型基金在同一时间救助用户资金，那么这种可能性是有可能的天。\n\n这是赌场 GCR 经常引用的 - 拥抱它。\n\n在这个领域努力工作的一些协议是 Ribbon、Friktion 和 Timeless；当然，还有很多其他的。我认为，如果这些协议能够生存并保持优质的产品供应 + 一致的 TVL 流入，它们有一天会变得非常大。随心所欲地处理这些信息。结构化产品在 Solana 上也非常重要，部分原因是我如此看好 L1 作为以太坊背后的共识 #2 选择。我看到 Solana 的唯一问题是它的网络中断、许多旧 alt 的当前糟糕的代币经济学、验证链的高硬件要求以及这种相对集中化。衍生品现在在 Solana 上也非常重要，这将我带入下一部分。\n\n## 衍生品\n\nCrypto 一直在努力看到其许多链上期权协议在使用和 TVL 方面起飞，从而导致 GMX、dYdX 和 Drift 等协议的复兴。尽管市场低迷且普遍缺乏流动性，但 GMX 还是看到新用户疯狂涌入。看看这张图表，它实际上是向上的：\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ktqFoheSa-REOaq6r7Klv.png?height=934&width=1364)\n\nGMX 并不孤单，因为 perp 交易的交易量一直很好，我只是不想在这个可爱的星期六晚上提取所有数据。\n\n资源？相信我。\n\n链上业务并没有像往常一样进行，但这些 perp 平台各自的代币一直保持良好，尽管大多数其他 alt 周围都存在混乱。像 dYdX 这样的项目具有非常糟糕的代币经济学和良好的使用情况，这意味着不购买代币可能会变得很愚蠢，因为它很可能会被更大的玩家作为“价值”游戏挖走。我们有 DeFi 蓝筹股，为什么没有永久蓝筹股？像 Drift、Perpetual Protocol（它的名字）和 01 Exchange 之类的协议都非常有趣，并且引起了极大的兴趣，他们有责任保持他们的交易量，让用户满意并确保他们不会破产。\n\n看看其他衍生协议，有一些在我们的雷达之下飞行，比如 Cega、Vega 和 Zeta（我知道这些名字很愚蠢）。许多相对较新的链上衍生平台的使用情况无法与我提到的一些大品牌相提并论，但它们为愿意涉足未知领域的用户提供了一些非常酷、有价值和独特的产品。举个例子，看看这张来自 Cega Finance 文档的图片：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72xe2ZX9215-OawFXL4lt.png?height=1279&width=1456)\n\n参考上述内容，我认为可以公平地假设我们会在加密货币领域看到更多此类产品。这更多地属于结构性产品，但它是一个衍生品平台，衍生品与结构性产品相关联——等等等等，不会彻底改变文章的结构——我希望你能明白它的要点。回到我关于选项的观点，DeFi 中没有足够的资金以令人满意的规模实现这一目标。做市商采取交易另一方的理由并不多，因为通常有更具货币吸引力的方式在不涉及去中心化期权协议的市场上赚钱。这是否意味着我们将永远看不到我们宝贵的链上宝石的选择？不，它不会像我们想要的那样立即发生。\n\n从定性和定量的角度来看，Perps 似乎是王者。它们相当容易理解，并且杠杆是每个人都喜欢的东西，即使他们在 10 次中亏损 9.9 次也是如此。预计 perp 交易量将继续上升并向右移动。\n\n## 跨链\n\n我决定包含一个与跨链相关的部分（非常简短，将大部分内容留到以后的文章中），因为它直接与 DeFi 的增长相吻合。在 2021 年期间，我们看到“alt L1 szn”一次又一次地上演。说真的，同样的剧本运行了 10 次，并且几乎没有失败（直到没有失败）。以太坊在 DeFi TVL 中的主导地位被进一步削弱，因为仅向上的 L1 代币、生态系统基金和看涨的 VC 的组合导致 TVL 在从 Avalanche 到 Fantom 的所有领域迅速崛起。\n\n虽然这些链中的许多现在已经远离地球表面（参见：Fantom），但仍有大量理由看好由 Synapse、LayerZero、Wormhole、Axelar 等协议支持的多链未来， Celer 和其他很多我不想一一列举的。其中许多在交换费用中赚了很多钱，持有巨额 TVL 并提供在当前状态下对加密至关重要的服务——没有太多不喜欢桥和使 dApp 能够在桥上本地构建的功能。更不用说许多这些跨链解决方案计划在不久的将来某个时候过渡到自己的链，从而导致潜在的“替代桥/跨链作为被低估的 L1s szn”（是的，当然这是我编造的），它可以以类似于 alt L1 的方式发送其中一些令牌和这些协议的未来令牌。但这是我的一个主要梦想，希望我们都能分享。\n\n当您考虑 DeFi 的未来以及它在大规模采用方面可能最终走向何方时，链不可知论的未来很有意义。当我们在肉类世界与支付进行交互时，我们不知道哪些底层服务正在为我们的交易提供动力和处理——我们只是照常做。这可能会成为 DeFi 的情况，远在全球 70 亿人口都在 DeFi 庞氏骗局上赌博 UBI 的时期之后，DeFi TVL 使今天的 TradFi 相形见绌。但我离题了。\n\n【welcome to join us】 \n WeChat1：victeam005 \n WeChat2：shijie20170405 \n Telegream：[https://t.me/VICOINDAOCHAT](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2FVICOINDAOCHAT) \n Twitter：[@VICOINDAO](https://weibo.com/n/VICOINDAO)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654658312, "digest": "q1U-_xKnVj6zdaf-Sh5SZwFnIlql-Xq65feUp9ofbgM", "contributor": "0xf6e546668c397dcb64767efe331904Ba147D5025"}

{"id": "MAtY_0S-eNJnmPf8EMZXeXT0fkmgVcnVh44BkAhvke4", "title": "Contribution Margin", "body": "## What Is Contribution Margin?\n\nThe contribution margin can be stated on a gross or per-unit basis. It represents the incremental money generated for each product/unit sold after deducting the variable portion of the firm's costs.\n\nThe contribution margin is computed as the selling price per unit, minus the [variable cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variablecost.asp) per unit. Also known as dollar contribution per unit, the measure indicates how a particular product contributes to the overall profit of the company.\n\nIt provides one way to show the profit potential of a particular product offered by a company and shows the portion of sales that helps to cover the company's fixed costs. Any remaining revenue left after covering fixed costs is the profit generated.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The contribution margin represents the portion of a product's sales revenue that isn't used up by variable costs, and so contributes to covering the company's fixed costs.\n* The concept of contribution margin is one of the fundamental keys in break-even analysis.\n* Low contribution margins are present in labor-intensive companies with few fixed expenses, while capital-intensive, industrial companies have higher fixed costs and thus, higher contribution margins.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n2:07\n\n#### Contribution Margin\n\n## Formula and Calculation of Contribution Margin\n\nThe contribution margin is computed as the difference between the sale price of a product and the variable costs associated with its production and sales process. \n \n\n## What Contribution Margin Can Tell You\n\nThe contribution margin is the foundation for [break-even analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakevenanalysis.asp) used in the overall cost and sales price planning for products. The contribution margin helps to separate out the fixed cost and profit components coming from product sales and can be used to determine the selling price range of a product, the profit levels that can be expected from the sales, and structure sales commissions paid to sales team members, distributors, or commission agents.\n\n## Fixed Cost vs. Variable Cost\n\nOne-time costs for items such as machinery are a typical example of a fixed cost that stays the same regardless of the number of [units sold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unitsales.asp), although it becomes a smaller percentage of each unit's cost as the number of units sold increases.\n\nOther examples include services and utilities that may come at a fixed cost and do not have an impact on the number of units produced or sold. For example, if the government offers unlimited electricity at a [fixed monthly cost](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-difference-between-variable-cost-and-fixed-cost-economics.asp) of $100, then manufacturing 10 units or 10,000 units will have the same fixed cost towards electricity.\n\nAnother example of fixed cost is a website hosting provider that offers unlimited hosting space to its clients at a fixed cost. Whether the client puts one or 10 websites, and whether the client uses 100 MB or 2 GB of hosting space, the hosting cost remains the same.\n\nIn these kinds of scenarios, electricity and web-hosting cost(s) will not be considered in the contribution margin formula as it represents a fixed cost. Fixed monthly rents or salaries paid to administrative staff also fall in the fixed cost category.\n\nHowever, if the same electricity cost increases in proportion to the consumption, and the [web-host charges](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090715/8-best-cloud-storage-solutions-small-business.asp) increase on the basis of the number of sites hosted and the space consumed, then the costs will be considered as variable costs.\n\nSimilarly, wages paid to employees who are getting paid based on the number of units they manufacture (or any of its variations) are variable costs. Each such item will be considered for contribution margin calculations.\n\nFixed costs are often considered [sunk costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp) that once spent cannot be recovered. These cost components should not be considered while taking decisions about cost analysis or profitability measures.\n\n## Example of Contribution Margin\n\nSay a machine for manufacturing ink pens comes at a cost of $10,000. Manufacturing one ink pen requires $0.2 worth of raw materials like plastic, ink and nib, another $0.1 goes towards the electricity charges for running the machine to produce one ink pen, and $0.3 is the labor charge to manufacture one ink pen.\n\nThese three components constitute the variable cost per unit. The total variable cost of manufacturing an ink pen comes to ($0.2 + $0.1 + $0.3) = $0.6 per unit. If a total of 100 ink pens are manufactured, the total variable cost will come to ($0.6 \\* 100 units) = $60, while manufacturing 10,000 ink pens will lead to a total variable cost of ($0.6 \\* 10,000 units) = $6,000. Such total variable cost increases in direct proportion to the number of units of the product getting manufactured.\n\nHowever, the ink pen production will be impossible without the manufacturing machine which comes at a fixed cost of $10,000. This cost of machine represents a [fixed cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedcost.asp) (and not a variable cost) as its charges do not increase based on the units produced. Such fixed costs are not considered in the contribution margin calculations.\n\nIf a total of 10,000 ink pens are manufactured using the machine at a variable cost of $6,000 and at a fixed cost of $10,000, the total manufacturing cost comes to $16,000. The per-unit cost will then be computed as $16,000/10,000 = $1.6 per unit. If each ink pen is sold at a price of $2 per unit, the profit per unit comes to\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &(SC - \\\\text{Total Costs}) = (\\\\$2.0 - \\\\$1.6) = \\\\$0.4 \\\\text{ per Unit}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &SC\\\\ =\\\\text{ Sales price} \\\\end{aligned}​(*SC*−Total Costs)=($2.0−$1.6)=$0.4 per Unitwhere:*SC* = Sales price​﻿\n\nHowever, contribution margin does not account for fixed cost components and considers only the variable cost components. The incremental profit earned for each unit sold as represented by contribution margin will be:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{(Sale Price} - \\\\text{TVC)} = (\\\\$2.0 - \\\\$0.6) = \\\\$1.4 \\\\text{ per Unit}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &TVC=\\\\text{ Total variable costs} \\\\end{aligned}​(Sale Price−TVC)=($2.0−$0.6)=$1.4 per Unitwhere:*TVC*= Total variable costs​﻿\n\nA key characteristic of the contribution margin is that it remains fixed on a per unit basis irrespective of the number of units manufactured or sold. On the other hand, the net profit per unit may increase/decrease non-linearly with the number of units sold as it includes the fixed costs.\n\nIn the above example, if the total number of ink pens manufactured and sold doubles to 20,000, the total cost (fixed + variable) will be ($10,000/20,000 + 0.6) = $1.1 per unit. The profit per unit will come to:\n\n(SC - \\\\text{Total Costs)} = (\\\\$2.0 - \\\\$1.1) = \\\\$0.9 \\\\text{ per Unit}(*SC*−Total Costs)=($2.0−$1.1)=$0.9 per Unit﻿\n\nEssentially, doubling the number of units sold from 10,000 to 20,000 (two times) has increased the net profit per unit from $0.4 to $0.9 (that is, 2.25 times).\n\nHowever, the contribution margin, which gets calculated with respect to only the variable cost, will be:\n\n\\\\text{(Sale Price} - \\\\text{TVC)} = (\\\\$2.0 - \\\\$0.6) = \\\\$1.4 \\\\text{ per Unit}(Sale Price−TVC)=($2.0−$0.6)=$1.4 per Unit﻿\n\nThe contribution margin remains the same, even when the number of units produced and sold has doubled. It provides another dimension to assess how much profits can be realized by scaling up sales.\n\n## Uses of Contribution Margin\n\nThe contribution margin can help company management select from among several possible products that compete to use the same set of manufacturing resources. Say that a company has a pen-manufacturing machine that is capable of producing both ink pens and ball-point pens, and management must make a choice to produce only one of them.\n\nIf the contribution margin for an ink pen is higher than that of a ball pen, the former will be given production preference owing to its higher [profitability](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/what-difference-between-profitability-and-profit.asp) potential. Such decision-making is common to companies that manufacture a diversified portfolio of products, and management must allocate available resources in the most efficient manner to products with the highest profit potential.\n\n### Contribution Margin for Investors\n\nInvestors and analysts may also attempt to calculate the contribution margin figure for a company's blockbuster products. For instance, a beverage company may have 15 different products but the bulk of its profits may come from one specific beverage.\n\nAlong with the company management, vigilant investors may keep a close eye on the contribution margin of a high-performing product relative to other products in order to assess the company's dependence on its star performer.\n\nThe company steering its focus away from investing or expanding the manufacturing of the star product, or the emergence of a competitor product, may indicate that the profitability of the company and eventually its share price may get impacted.\n\nVery low or negative contribution margin values indicate economically nonviable products whose manufacturing and sales should be discarded. Low values of contribution margins can be observed in the labor-intensive industry sectors like manufacturing as the variable costs are higher, while high values of contribution margins are prevalent in the [capital-intensive sectors](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/which-types-industries-have-largest-capital-expenditures.asp).\n\nThe concept of contribution margin is applicable at various levels of [manufacturing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/manufacturing.asp), business segments, and products. The figure can be computed for an entire corporation, for a particular [subsidiary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidiary.asp), for a particular business division or unit, for a particular center or facility, for distribution or sales channel, for a product line, or for individual products.\n\n## How Do You Calculate Contribution Margin?\n\nContribution margin is calculated as Revenue - Variable Costs. The contribution margin ratio is calculated as (Revenue - Variable Costs) / Revenue.\n\n## What Is a Good Contribution Margin?\n\nThe best contribution margin is 100%, so the closer the contribution margin is to 100%, the better. The higher the number, the better a company is at covering its overhead costs with money on hand.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between Contribution Margin and Profit Margin?\n\nProfit margin is the amount of revenue that remains after the direct production costs are subtracted. Contribution margin is a measure of the profitability of each individual product that a business sells.", "timestamp": 1654658379, "digest": "RpWNohUe48M9uKi4zUhAIBHb72NSN3Uwhq4cPvqZUnI", "contributor": "0xf12D9484B42BCBB6AE338566aa1C17254460dEDe"}
{"id": "MQHmmn0SAc6N_cbllzhwi6nF9YGbXd7r0MayXY5fuUo", "title": "Disbursement", "body": "## What Is Disbursement?\n\nDisbursement means paying out money. The term disbursement may be used to describe money paid into a business' operating budget, the delivery of a loan amount to a borrower, or the payment of a dividend to shareholders. Money paid by an intermediary, such as a lawyer's payment to a third party on behalf of a client, may also be called a disbursement.\n\nTo a business, disbursement is part of [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp). It is a record of day-to-day expenses. If cash flow is negative, meaning that disbursements are higher than revenues, it can be an early warning of insolvency.\n\nA disbursement is the actual delivery of funds from a bank account.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A disbursement is the actual delivery of funds from one party's bank account to another.\n* In business accounting, a disbursement is a payment in cash during a specific time period and is recorded in the general ledger of the business.\n* This record of disbursements shows how the business is spending cash over time.\n* Payments of dividends to shareholders are often termed disbursements.\n* Student loan money paid into a school's account on behalf of a student is termed a disbursement.\n\n## How Disbursement Works\n\nIn bookkeeping, [a disbursement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-disbursement-journal.asp) is a payment made by the company in cash or cash equivalents during a set time period, such as a quarter or a year. A bookkeeper records each transaction and posts it to one or more ledgers, such as a cash disbursement journal and the [general ledger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalledger.asp).\n\nAn entry for a disbursement includes the date, the payee name, the amount debited or credited, the payment method, and the purpose of the payment. The overall cash balance of the business is then adjusted to account for the disbursement.\n\nDisbursements are a record of the money flowing out of the business and may differ from actual profit or loss. For example, a company using the [accrual method of accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrualaccounting.asp) reports expenses when they occur, not necessarily when they are paid, and reports income when it is earned, not when it is received.\n\nThe type of items listed in the ledger depends on the business. A retailer has payments for inventory, [accounts payable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp), and salaries. A manufacturer has transactions for raw materials and production costs.\n\nManagers use the ledgers to determine how much cash has been disbursed and to track it. For example, management can see how much cash is being spent on inventory compared to other costs. Since the ledger records the numbers of the checks issued, the managers also can see whether any checks are missing or wrongly recorded.\n\nA disbursement is a cash outflow. It can be any form of payment.\n\n## Types of Disbursement\n\nThere are other, more obscure uses of the word disbursement, including the controlled disbursement and the delayed disbursement (also called the remote disbursement).\n\n### Controlled Disbursement\n\n[Controlled disbursement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/controlled-disbursement.asp) is a type of cash flow management service that banks make available to their corporate clients. It allows them to review and reschedule disbursements on a day-to-day basis. That gives them the opportunity to maximize the interest they earn on the cash in their accounts by delaying the precise time that an amount of money is debited from the account.\n\n### Delayed Disbursement\n\n[Delayed disbursement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delayed-disbursement.asp), also called remote disbursement, is deliberately dragging out the payment process by paying with a check drawn on a bank located in a remote region. In the days when a bank could process a payment only when the original paper check was received, this could delay the debit to the payer's account by up to five business days.\n\nThe widespread acceptance of an electronic copy of a check in lieu of the original paper check has made this tactic hard to pull off.\n\n## Disbursement vs. Drawdown\n\n### \n\n*A withdrawal from a retirement account is termed a disbursement. Once the money is disbursed, it is recorded on the account as a drawdown of the balance.*\n\nAs noted above, a disbursement is a payment. A [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/what-difference-between-drawdown-and-disbursement.asp), however, is a consequence of a particular type of disbursement.\n\nIf you take money out of a retirement account, you receive a disbursement of money. That disbursement represents a drawdown on the balance in your account.\n\nSay you're a retiree, and you withdraw 10% of a $100,000 balance in a traditional IRA account. That $10,000 you receive is a disbursement from your IRA. It also represents a drawdown of $10,000, or 10%, from your account, which now has a balance of $90,000.\n\nIn general, a drawdown is a measure of a decline from a historical peak. A 10% reduction in the size of a military force might be described as a 10% drawdown of forces. An oil company that exploits 3% of its proven oil reserves will record a 3% drawdown of its supply.\n\n## Examples of Disbursements\n\nWhile pursuing a legal case, an attorney must keep a record of disbursements made on behalf of a client. This may include payments to various [third parties](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/third-party.asp) for costs incurred in the case, including court fees, private investigator services, courier services, and expert reports.\n\nProperly documenting these costs is crucial in a legal case in order to make an accurate determination of the client’s losses and create an understanding of claimed damages. The attorney must notify the client and the insurance company before incurring high disbursement costs, and the client must reimburse the attorney.\n\n### Student Loan Disbursement\n\nA student loan disbursement is the payout of loan proceeds on behalf of a borrower, who is the student. Schools and loan servicers notify students of the expected receipt of the disbursements in writing, including the amount of the loan and its effective date.\n\nFederal and private student loans are generally disbursed two or more times during the academic year. The student receives a credit to pay tuition and fees and will receive any remaining balance by check or direct deposit.\n\n### Positive and Negative Disbursement\n\nA loan disbursement may be positive or negative. A positive disbursement results in a credit to an account, while a negative disbursement results in an account debit. A negative disbursement may occur if financial aid funds are overpaid and later withdrawn from the student's account.\n\n## Disbursement FAQs\n\nHere are the answers to some commonly asked questions about disbursement.\n\n### What Is a Loan Disbursement?\n\nA loan is disbursed when the agreed-upon amount is actually paid into the borrower's account and is available for use. The cash has been debited from the lender's account and credited to the borrower's account.\n\n### Is a Disbursement a Refund?\n\nIn the lingo of the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid, a disbursement is the actual payment of the funds into an account that will support a student's studies in the upcoming semester. If the loan amount exceeds the actual costs of tuition and fees, a refund of the excess is paid directly to the student.1\n\n### What Is the Difference Between a Disbursement and a Payment?\n\nA disbursement is a payment. The word disbursement implies a payment that has been finalized. That is, it has been properly recorded as a debit on the payer's side and a credit on the payee's side.\n\n### What Is a Disbursement Fee?\n\nA disbursement fee is usually a vendor's charge to cover payments made by the vendor in the course of its work on behalf of a customer. For example, FedEx may pay duty and tax charges for a shipment on behalf of a customer, and then add a disbursement fee to its bill to the customer to cover the payments.2\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nA disbursement is a payment that has been completed and recorded as such. That is, it has been debited from the payer's account and credited to the payee's account.\n\nIn business, the regular recording of all disbursements of cash is a crucial method of keeping tabs on the expenditures of the business.\n\nIn the wider world, the word disbursement is used in a variety of contexts, from the crediting of student loan money to the finalization of a withdrawal from a retirement account.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstisR_fA1wsqph5I0KP0PPq3AeG3krH7Xix3ZxFvmuqJnQh7KjPgCoqoFYfRvBKBKioL9uzjiEhMwTPstbFkPwYi1kP6pxw_MKPA_kVHvugnwahcQW9N6Q99TOHHKK9fbA6sAdQWhtqaTiYZDEFdsGNAVAkJ_j7t9V5PCinWnFtbJCN0QJtWxISagJSQt380kzTSn7iitNjj87j2mle36v1QRMv1tTQoCFUxWn-1CMcE9Z-WJm1Abvzioha2RKfRQQ5C8b1QLjrhqkyHuocRiYeWkDxaiGmNxXvBHtgFzu_GLj58arQvauD9JX1knyXrexvuNUv0HGGcg&sig=Cg0ArKJSzG9Ql39XFVIkEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

PNG\n\n世界上哪有这么便宜的东西会自动找你？\n\n如果你真的相信了他们\n\n可能你就是被占便宜的那个人\n\nNFT 由上年年末一直火热到现在\n\n相信十个人里 九个都有买 NFT 的经验\n\n剩下的一个正在考虑要不要买 NFT\n\n至于买了 NFT 的你们\n\n有没有尝试过把 NFT 卖出去变现呢？\n\n或者是曾经透过 NFT 赚到钱甚至是几倍利润的呢？\n\n又或者是你制作了一个 NFT 项目\n\n但不知道怎样卖出去 以及有什么地方需要留意\n\n今天就跟大家分享4个为什么 NFT 卖不出去的原因\n\n第一个 NFT 卖不出去的原因是\n\nNFT 的艺术性与知名度低\n\n就好像一些名人或者知名品牌\n\n他们推出的产品或者艺术品很容易就卖得出去\n\n他们推出 NFT 也会比较容易以更高的价格卖出\n\n因为作品本身已经有一群粉丝支持\n\n还有比较高的知名度\n\n就例如蒙罗丽沙的微笑\n\n如果它变为 NFT\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O-VmPhXc8T7qffifFdPVX.png?height=733&width=852)\n\n本身不觉得漂亮\n\n或不懂得欣赏它也好\n\n当它推出后 它升值那么多也是有理由的\n\n你也不会质疑它的价值\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K5fj2yu9zuOQMRSulCn4V.png?height=848&width=725)\n\n又例如村上隆与Gucci\n\n推出 NFT 的时候自然有不少人会捧场\n\n以村上隆为例\n\n他与上次跟 Nike 收购的 NFT 收藏品新创公司\n\nRTFKT Studios 合作推出的大型项目“CLONEX”为例\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aTsfgd40zFHo9xnaDUleK.png?height=915&width=880)\n\n在12月1日公开发售 它以荷兰拍的方式进行\n\n以3个 ETH 起标\n\n每30分钟便会下降 0.1 ETH\n\n这项 NFT 专案的名气很高\n\n推特关注人数高达 15万人\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NbW07PjiG5--InErrMeA6.png?height=753&width=1080)\n\nCLONEX 现时地板价是13.5 ETH\n\n35万多 RMB 是一个比较昂贵的 NFT\n\n图片\n\nGucci 推出 NFT “Super Gucci”\n\n这个联名 Superplastic 的 NFT\n\n赠送 NFT 持有者\n\n一个 Gucci 共同设计的意大利手工陶瓷\n\n这是它其中一个特点\n\n现在市面上任何人都可以推出自己的 NFT\n\n特别是 Solana 区块链上 NFT 质量参差不齐\n\n所以一些艺术性或知名度比较低的也很可能滞销\n\n目前的 NFT 实在太多太多\n\n每一天都有新的 NFT 专案推出\n\n如此多人想制作 NFT\n\n如此多人涌入这个市场\n\n特别是如此多不了解或不熟悉的人\n\n都令我担心起这个泡沫会越来越厉害\n\n甚至令我觉得有大部分的 NFT 可能只能炒作一下子\n\n以后它们的价值便会蒸发\n\n甚至完全消失 个人也完全不会奇怪\n\n所以 懂得如何选择、创造有价值的 NFT 其实十分重要\n\n第二个 NFT 滞销的原因 便是因为缺乏团队宣传\n\n很多 NFT 项目开始时也没有知名度\n\n因此非常需要制作团队协助他们宣传\n\n制造市场上的需求\n\n如果项目什么都不做\n\n自身没有名气\n\n当然不会有人购买你的 NFT 作品\n\n现在有一些 NFT 项目都会找名人或网红宣传\n\n甚至购买广告牌进行宣传\n\n大家最近都在 Instagram 和推特上看到\n\n看到很多人分享 NFT Giveaway 活动\n\n大部分都是叫人分享至限时动态还有标注朋友\n\n这些方法除了能在短时间内有粉丝群以外\n\n还可以增加他们的曝光率\n\n算是一个挺成功 且可以贴近大众的方法\n\n或者在 Discord 上 会有一些提升等级的活动\n\n等级足够高便能加入白名单或 Giveaway 活动\n\n让更多人愿意在群组内踊跃发言\n\n也可以持续保持项目有一定的讨论度\n\n有一些做得比较好的 NFT 项目\n\n可能还可以令 NFT 变得更有用途\n\n凝聚出一个团结的社群\n\n不过 不免还是会有许多虎头蛇尾的 NFT 项目\n\n开始时大张旗鼓 准备 mint 的时段更是大规模宣传\n\n不过一会后

{"id": "43OD2gpDIlrxgy8paw53QHio5I9rA5TIraSJ_xzzqlU", "title": "Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n", "body": "## What Is the Capital Asset Pricing Model?\n\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk and [expected return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) for assets, particularly stocks.1 CAPM is widely used throughout finance for pricing risky [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) and generating expected returns for assets given the risk of those assets and [cost of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp).\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 39 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n2:39\n\n#### Capital Asset Pricing Model - CAPM\n\n## Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n\nThe formula for calculating the expected return of an asset given its risk is as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &ER_i = R_f + \\\\beta_i ( ER_m - R_f ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &ER_i = \\\\text{expected return of investment} \\\\\\\\ &R_f = \\\\text{risk-free rate} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\beta_i = \\\\text{beta of the investment} \\\\\\\\ &(ER_m - R_f) = \\\\text{market risk premium} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​*ERi*​=*Rf*​+*βi*​(*ERm*​−*Rf*​)where:*ERi*​=expected return of investment*Rf*​=risk-free rate*βi*​=beta of the investment(*ERm*​−*Rf*​)=market risk premium​﻿\n\nInvestors expect to be compensated for risk and the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp). The [risk-free rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp) in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. The other components of the CAPM formula account for the investor taking on additional risk.\n\nThe [beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) of a potential investment is a measure of how much risk the investment will add to a portfolio that looks like the market. If a stock is riskier than the market, it will have a beta greater than one. If a stock has a beta of less than one, the formula assumes it will reduce the risk of a portfolio.\n\nA stock’s beta is then multiplied by the [market risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketriskpremium.asp), which is the return expected from the market above the risk-free rate. The [risk-free rate](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/how-riskfree-rate-determined-when-calculating-market-risk-premium.asp) is then added to the product of the stock’s beta and the market risk premium. The result should give an investor the [required return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredrateofreturn.asp) or [discount rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp) they can use to find the value of an asset.\n\nThe goal of the CAPM formula is to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when its risk and the time value of money are compared to its expected return.\n\nFor example, imagine an investor is contemplating a stock worth $100 per share today that pays a 3% annual dividend. The stock has a beta compared to the market of 1.3, which means it is riskier than a market portfolio. Also, assume that the risk-free rate is 3% and this investor expects the market to rise in value by 8% per year.\n\nThe expected return of the stock based on the CAPM formula is 9.5%:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &9.5\\\\% = 3\\\\% + 1.3 \\\\times ( 8\\\\% - 3\\\\% ) \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​9.5%=3%+1.3×(8%−3%)​﻿\n\nThe expected return of the CAPM formula is used to discount the expected dividends and capital appreciation of the stock over the expected holding period. If the discounted value of those future cash flows is equal to $100 then the CAPM formula indicates the stock is fairly valued relative to risk.\n\n## Problems With the CAPM\n\nThere are several assumptions behind the CAPM formula that have been shown not to hold in reality. Modern financial theory rests on two assumptions: One, securities markets are very competitive and efficient (that is, relevant information about the companies is quickly and universally distributed and absorbed) and two, these markets are dominated by rational, risk-averse investors, who seek to maximize satisfaction from returns on their investments.\n\nDespite these issues, the CAPM formula is still widely used because it is simple and allows for easy comparisons of investment alternatives.\n\nIncluding beta in the formula assumes that risk can be measured by a stock’s price [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp). However, price movements in both directions are not equally risky. The look-back period to determine a stock’s volatility is not standard because stock returns (and risk) are not [normally distributed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp).\n\nThe CAPM also assumes that the risk-free rate will remain constant over the discounting period. Assume in the previous example that the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds rose to 5% or 6% during the 10-year holding period. An increase in the risk-free rate also increases the cost of the capital used in the investment and could make the stock look [overvalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp).\n\nThe market portfolio that is used to find the market risk premium is only a theoretical value and is not an asset that can be purchased or invested in as an alternative to the stock. Most of the time, investors will use a major stock index, like the S&P 500, to substitute for the market, which is an imperfect comparison.\n\nThe most serious critique of the CAPM is the assumption that future cash flows can be estimated for the discounting process. If an investor could estimate the future return of a stock with a high level of accuracy, the CAPM would not be necessary.\n\n## The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier\n\nUsing the CAPM to build a portfolio is supposed to help an investor manage their risk. If an investor were able to use the CAPM to perfectly optimize a portfolio’s return relative to risk, it would exist on a curve called the [efficient frontier](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp), as shown in the following graph.\n\nImage by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019\n\nThe graph shows how greater expected returns (y-axis) require greater expected risk (x-axis). [Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) suggests that starting with the risk-free rate, the expected return of a portfolio increases as the risk increases. Any portfolio that fits on the [Capital Market Line (CML)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cml.asp) is better than any possible portfolio to the right of that line, but at some point, a theoretical portfolio can be constructed on the CML with the best return for the amount of risk being taken.\n\nThe CML and efficient frontier may be difficult to define, but it illustrates an important concept for investors: there is a trade-off between increased return and increased risk. Because it isn’t possible to perfectly build a portfolio that fits on the CML, it is more common for investors to take on too much risk as they seek additional return.\n\nIn the following chart, you can see two portfolios that have been constructed to fit along the efficient frontier. Portfolio A is expected to return 8% per year and has a 10% [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) or risk level. Portfolio B is expected to return 10% per year but has a 16% standard deviation. The risk of portfolio B rose faster than its expected returns.\n\nImage by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019\n\nThe efficient frontier assumes the same things as the CAPM and can only be calculated in theory. If a portfolio existed on the efficient frontier it would be providing the maximal return for its level of risk. However, it is impossible to know whether a portfolio exists on the efficient frontier or not because future returns cannot be predicted.\n\nThis trade-off between risk and return applies to the CAPM and the efficient frontier graph can be rearranged to illustrate the trade-off for individual assets. In the following chart, you can see that the CML is now called the [Security Market Line (SML)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sml.asp). Instead of expected risk on the x-axis, the stock’s beta is used. As you can see in the illustration, as beta increases from one to two, the expected return is also rising.\n\nImage by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019\n\nThe CAPM and SML make a connection between a stock’s beta and its expected risk. A higher beta means more risk but a portfolio of high beta stocks could exist somewhere on the CML where the trade-off is acceptable, if not the theoretical ideal.\n\nThe value of these two models is diminished by assumptions about beta and market participants that aren’t true in the real markets. For example, beta does not account for the relative riskiness of a stock that is more volatile than the market with a high frequency of downside shocks compared to another stock with an equally high beta that does not experience the same kind of price movements to the downside.\n\n## Practical Value of the CAPM\n\nConsidering the critiques of the CAPM and the assumptions behind its use in portfolio construction, it might be difficult to see how it could be useful. However, using the CAPM as a tool to evaluate the reasonableness of future expectations or to conduct comparisons can still have some value.\n\nImagine an advisor who has proposed adding a stock to a portfolio with a $100 share price. The advisor uses the CAPM to justify the price with a discount rate of 13%. The advisor’s investment manager can take this information and compare it to the company’s past performance and its peers to see if a 13% return is a reasonable expectation.\n\nAssume in this example that the peer group’s performance over the last few years was a little better than 10% while this stock had consistently underperformed with 9% returns. The investment manager shouldn’t take the advisor’s recommendation without some justification for the increased expected return.\n\nAn investor can also use the concepts from the CAPM and efficient frontier to evaluate their portfolio or individual stock performance compared to the rest of the market. For example, assume that an investor’s portfolio has returned 10% per year for the last three years with a standard deviation of returns (risk) of 10%. However, the market averages have returned 10% for the last three years with a risk of 8%.\n\nThe investor could use this observation to reevaluate how their portfolio is constructed and which holdings may not be on the SML. This could explain why the investor’s portfolio is to the right of the CML. If the holdings that are either dragging on returns or have increased the portfolio’s risk disproportionately can be identified, the investor can make changes to improve returns.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe CAPM uses the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory to determine if a security is fairly valued. It relies on assumptions about investor behaviors, risk and return distributions, and market fundamentals that don’t match reality. However, the underlying concepts of CAPM and the associated efficient frontier can help investors understand the relationship between expected risk and reward as they make better decisions about adding securities to a portfolio.", "timestamp": 1654658558, "digest": "ZVKDzujKeitr-ekhEkiHlM9Kj2xHKUxlbbe7PQ-DbWg", "contributor": "0x0Df9Ed3d8e88B53046415B4Cc57f8C4A55EFFc77"}

The [customer service representatives](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/110315/considering-career-client-service-associate.asp) are the ones who have direct contact with the buyers. The buyers' perceptions of the company and the product are shaped in part by their experience in dealing with that person.\n\nFor this reason, many companies work hard to increase their customer satisfaction levels.\n\n### The Cost of Customer Satisfaction\n\nFor decades, businesses in many industries have sought to reduce personnel costs by automating their processes to the greatest extent possible.\n\nIn [customer service](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/07/multi-service.asp), that has led many companies to implement systems online and by phone that answer as many questions or resolve as many problems as they can without a human presence.\n\nBut in the end, there are customer service issues for which human interaction is indispensable, creating a [competitive advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp).\n\nAmazon is an example of a company that is doing all it can to automate a vast and complex operation. It has to, given that it delivered 4.2 billion packages to customers' doors in 2020.1\n\nNevertheless, Amazon still offers 24-hour customer service by phone, in addition to email and live chat services.\n\nMost successful businesses recognize the importance of providing outstanding customer service. Courteous and empathetic interaction with a trained customer service representative can mean the difference between losing or retaining a customer.\n\nCustomer service should be a one-stop process for the consumer whenever possible.\n\n### Key Components of Good Customer Service\n\n[Successful small business owners](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/make-money-in-business.asp) understand the need for good customer service instinctively. Larger businesses study the subject in-depth, and they have some basic conclusions about the key components:\n\n* Timely attention to issues raised by customers is critical. Requiring a customer to wait in line or sit on hold sours an interaction before it begins.\n* Customer service should be a single-step process for the consumer. If a customer calls a helpline, the representative should whenever possible follow the problem through to its resolution.\n* If a customer must be transferred to another department, the original representative should follow up with the customer to ensure that the problem was solved.\n\n### $35,830\n\n*The average annual salary for a customer service representative in 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.2*\n\n## Customer Services Job Requirements\n\nMuch is expected of customer service representatives. Yet the pay for the job is low. The average salary in 2020 was about $35,830, according to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/092204.asp).2\n\nSome of the job expectations:\n\n* Customer service representatives must be accessible, knowledgeable, and courteous. They require excellent listening skills and a willingness to talk through a resolution. Training in conflict resolution can be beneficial.\n* Strong speaking skills are important. For phone staff, this means speaking clearly and slowly while maintaining a calm demeanor even if the customer doesn't.\n\n### \n\n*The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected customer service representative job growth to show little or no change from 2020 to 2030.2*\n\n## Customer Services Employer Responsibilities\n\nPoor management can doom any customer service operation. A couple of important tips for managers:\n\n* Make sure your customer service representatives are fully informed and have the latest information and the company's products and policies.\n* Periodically assess the customer service experience you are providing to ensure that it's an asset to the company.\n* Consider conducting regular surveys to give customers the chance to provide feedback about the service they receive and suggest areas for improvement.\n\n## Using Mobile Services Effectively\n\nIn recent years, studies of customer service have centered on creating the perfect [online experience](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/11/benefits-and-drawbacks-of-internet-banks.asp).3\n\nThe first and most difficult factor is the multiplicity of channels. Today's customers expect to get service through whatever app or device they happen to be using at the moment. That may be a mobile device or a laptop, a social media site, text app, or live chat.\n\nOnce again, the focus has been on packaging how-to content and related resources that are designed for self-service. Increasingly [sophisticated data analytics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pareto-analysis.asp) also are being used to identify dissatisfied or low-engagement customers.\n\nBut, as always, the most effective customer service apps need to incorporate human contact, if only as a last resort.", "timestamp": 1654658483, "digest": "t7zbOeX5v_wy-EBmyqVkVzeyqDnPXNyXy-UiXbRrVz8", "contributor": "0x6F355185A3Eb84F7f489C596C8C828a4E29827DA"}

{"id": "LsfVHtxBKtcScVrNQ7VhPnrw_QpcUtN7VlhsAubAuis", "title": "Diversification", "body": "## What Is Diversification?\n\nDiversification is a [risk management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp) strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\n\nPortfolio holdings can be diversified not just across asset classes, but also within classes by investing in foreign markets as well as domestic markets. The idea is that the positive performance of one area of a portfolio will outweigh the negatives in another.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Diversification is a strategy that mixes a [wide variety](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wide-variety.asp) of investments within a portfolio.\n* Portfolio holdings can be diversified across asset classes and within classes, and also geographically—by investing in both domestic and foreign markets.\n* Diversification limits portfolio risk but can also mitigate performance, at least in the short term.\n\n## The Basics of Diversification\n\nStudies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. The investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, albeit at a drastically smaller rate.\n\nDiversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the [negative performance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-return.asp) of others. The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly [correlated](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp)—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.\n\n## Diversification by Asset Class\n\nFund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. Classes can include:\n\n* Stocks—shares or equity in a publicly traded company\n* [Bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp)—government and corporate fixed-income debt instruments\n* Real estate—land, buildings, natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and water and mineral deposits\n* Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—a marketable basket of securities that follow an index, commodity, or sector\n* [Commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp)—basic goods necessary for the production of other products or services\n* Cash and short-term cash-equivalents (CCE)—Treasury bills, certificate of deposit (CD), money market vehicles, and other short-term, low-risk investments\n\nThey will then diversify among investments within the assets classes, such as by selecting stocks from various sectors that tend to have low return correlation, or by choosing stocks with different [market capitalizations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp). In the case of bonds, investors can select from investment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. Treasuries, state and municipal bonds, high-yield bonds and others. \n\n## Foreign Diversification\n\nInvestors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities because they tend to be less closely correlated with domestic ones. For example, forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japan's economy in the same way. Therefore, holding Japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn.\n\n## Diversification and the Retail Investor\n\nTime and budget constraints can make it difficult for noninstitutional investors—i.e., individuals—to create an adequately diversified portfolio. This challenge is a key reason why [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/introduction-mutual-funds/) are so popular with retail investors. Buying shares in a mutual fund offers an inexpensive way to diversify investments.\n\nWhile mutual funds provide diversification across various asset classes, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) afford investor access to narrow markets such as commodities and international plays that would ordinarily be difficult to access. An individual with a $100,000 portfolio can spread the investment among ETFs with no overlap.\n\n## Disadvantages of Diversification\n\nReduced risk, a volatility buffer: The pluses of diversification are many. However, there are drawbacks, too. The more holdings a portfolio has, the more time-consuming it can be to manage—and the more expensive, since buying and selling many different holdings incurs more transaction fees and brokerage commissions. More fundamentally, diversification's spreading-out strategy works both ways, lessening both the risk and the reward.\n\nSay you've invested $120,000 equally among six stocks, and one stock doubles in value. Your original $20,000 stake is now worth $40,000. You've made a lot, sure, but not as much as if your entire $120,000 had been invested in that one company. By protecting you on the downside, diversification limits you on the upside—at least, in the short term. Over the long term, diversified portfolios do tend to post higher returns (see example below).\n\nPros\n\n* Reduces portfolio risk\n* Hedges against market volatility\n* Offers higher returns long-term\n\nCons\n\n* Limits gains short-term\n* Time-consuming to manage\n* Incurs more transaction fees, commissions\n\n## Diversification and Smart Beta\n\n[Smart beta strategies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta.asp) offer diversification by tracking underlying indices but do not necessarily weigh stocks according to their market cap. ETF managers further screen equity issues on fundamentals and rebalance portfolios according to objective analysis and not just company size. While smart beta portfolios are unmanaged, the primary goal becomes outperformance of the index itself.\n\nFor example, as of March 2019, the iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF holds 125 large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks. By focusing on return on equity (ROE), debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio, and not solely market cap, the ETF has returned 90.49% cumulatively since its inception in July 2013. A similar investment in the S&P 500 Index grew by 66.33%.\n\n## Real World Example\n\nSay an [aggressive investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggressiveinvestmentstrategy.asp) who can assume a higher level of risk, wishes to construct a portfolio composed of Japanese equities, Australian bonds, and cotton futures. He can purchase stakes in the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, the Vanguard Australian Government Bond Index ETF, and the iPath Bloomberg Cotton Subindex Total Return ETN, for example.\n\nWith this mix of ETF shares, due to the specific qualities of the targeted asset classes and the transparency of the holdings, the investor ensures true diversification in their holdings. Also, with different correlations, or responses to outside forces, among the securities, they can slightly lessen their risk exposure.

CapEx is often used to undertake new projects or [investments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-investment.asp) by a company. Making capital expenditures on fixed assets can include repairing a roof, purchasing a piece of equipment, or building a new factory. This type of financial outlay is made by companies to increase the scope of their operations or add some economic benefit to the operation.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Capital expenditure (CapEx) is a payment for goods or services recorded—or capitalized—on the balance sheet instead of expensed on the income statement.\n* CapEx spending is important for companies to maintain existing property and equipment, and invest in new technology and other assets for growth.\n* If an item has a useful life of less than one year, it must be expensed on the income statement rather than capitalized (i.e., cannot be considered CapEx).\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 36 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:36\n\n#### Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)\n\n## Formula and Calculation of Capital Expenditures (CapEx)\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{CapEx} = \\\\Delta \\\\text{PP\\\\&E} + \\\\text{Current Depreciation} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CapEx} = \\\\text{Capital expenditures} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\Delta \\\\text{PP\\\\&E} = \\\\text{Change in property, plant, and equipment} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​CapEx=ΔPP&E+Current Depreciationwhere:CapEx=Capital expendituresΔPP&E=Change in property, plant, and equipment​﻿\n\n## What CapEx Can Tell You\n\nCapEx can tell you how much a company is investing in existing and new [fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp) to maintain or grow the business. Put differently, CapEx is any type of expense that a company capitalizes, or shows on its balance sheet as an investment, rather than on its income statement as an expenditure. Capitalizing an asset requires the company to spread the cost of the expenditure over the [useful life](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usefullife.asp) of the asset.\n\nThe amount of capital expenditures a company is likely to have is dependent on the industry. Some of the most capital-intensive industries have the highest levels of capital expenditures including oil exploration and production, telecommunication, manufacturing, and utility industries.\n\nCapEx can be found in the cash flow from investing activities in a company's [cash flow statement](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/what-is-a-cash-flow-statement/). Different companies highlight CapEx in a number of ways, and an analyst or investor may see it listed as capital spending, purchases of [property, plant, and equipment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppe.asp) (PP&E), or acquisition expense.\n\nYou can also calculate capital expenditures by using data from a company's income statement and balance sheet. On the income statement, find the amount of [depreciation expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) recorded for the current period. On the balance sheet, locate the current period's property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) line-item balance.\n\nLocate the company's prior-period PP&E balance, and take the difference between the two to find the change in the company's PP&E balance. Add the change in PP&E to the current-period depreciation expense to arrive at the company's current-period CapEx spending.\n\n## The Difference Between CapEx and Operating Expenses (OpEx)\n\nCapital expenditure should not be confused with [operating expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp) (OpEx). Operating expenses are shorter-term expenses required to meet the ongoing operational costs of running a business. Unlike capital expenditures, operating expenses can be fully deducted from the company's taxes in the same year in which the expenses occur.\n\nIn terms of accounting, an expense is considered to be CapEx when the asset is a newly purchased capital asset or an investment that has a life of more than one year, or which improves the useful life of an existing capital asset. If, however, the expense is one that maintains the asset at its current condition, such as a repair, the cost is typically deducted fully in the year the expense is incurred.1\n\nThe greater the CapEx for a firm, the lower the FCFE.\n\n## Example of How to Use Capital Expenditures\n\nAside from analyzing a company's investment in its fixed assets, the CapEx metric is used in several ratios for company analysis. The [cash-flow-to-capital-expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow_capex.asp) (CF-to-CapEx) ratio relates to a company's ability to acquire long-term assets using free cash flow. The CF-to-CapEx ratio will often fluctuate as businesses go through cycles of [large and small capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/112814/what-are-some-examples-main-types-capital-expenditures-capex.asp).\n\nA ratio greater than 1 could mean that the company's operations are generating the [cash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-available-for-distribution.asp) needed to fund its asset acquisitions. On the other hand, a low ratio may indicate that the company is having issues with cash inflows and, hence, its purchase of capital assets. A company with a ratio of less than one may need to borrow money to fund its purchase of capital assets.\n\nFor example, ABC Company, for the fiscal year had $7.46 billion in capital expenditures, compared to XYZ Corporation, which purchased PPE worth $1.25 billion for the same fiscal year.\n\nCF-to-CapEx is calculated as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{CF/CapEx} = \\\\frac { \\\\text{Cash Flow from Operations} }{ \\\\text{CapEx} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CF/CapEx} = \\\\text{Cash flow to capital expenditure ratio} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​CF/CapEx=CapExCash Flow from Operations​where:CF/CapEx=Cash flow to capital expenditure ratio​\n\nUsing this formula, ABC's CF-to-CapEx is as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\frac { \\\\$14.51\\\\ \\\\text{Billion} }{ \\\\$7.46\\\\ \\\\text{Billion} } = 1.94 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​$7.46 Billion$14.51 Billion​=1.94​\n\nABC's CF-to-CapEx is as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\frac { \\\\$6.88\\\\ \\\\text{Billion} }{ \\\\$1.25\\\\ \\\\text{Billion} } = 5.49 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​$1.25 Billion$6.88 Billion​=5.49​\n\nIt is important to note that this is an industry-specific ratio and should only be compared to a ratio derived from another company that has similar CapEx requirements.\n\nCapital expenditures are also used in calculating [free cash flow to equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflowtoequity.asp) (FCFE). FCFE is the amount of cash available to equity shareholders. The formula FCFE is:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{FCFE} = \\\\text{EP} - ( \\\\text{CE} - \\\\text{D} ) \\\\times ( 1 - \\\\text{DR} ) - \\\\Delta \\\\text{C} \\\\times ( 1 - \\\\text{DR} ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{FCFE} = \\\\text{Free cash flow to equity} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EP} = \\\\text{Earnings per share} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CE} = \\\\text{CapEx} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{D} = \\\\text{Depreciation} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{DR} = \\\\text{Debt ratio} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\Delta \\\\text{C} = \\\\Delta \\\\text{Net capital, change in net working capital} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​FCFE=EP−(CE−D)×(1−DR)−ΔC×(1−DR)where:FCFE=Free cash flow to equityEP=Earnings per shareCE=CapExD=DepreciationDR=Debt ratioΔC=ΔNet capital, change in net working capital​\n\nOr, alternatively, it can be calculated as: \n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{FCFE} = \\\\text{NI} - \\\\text{NCE} - \\\\Delta \\\\text{C} + \\\\text{ND} - \\\\text{DR} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{NI} = \\\\text{Net income} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{NCE} = \\\\text{Net CapEx} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{ND} = \\\\text{New debt} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{DR} = \\\\text{Debt repayment} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​FCFE=NI−NCE−ΔC+ND−DRwhere:NI=Net incomeNCE=Net CapExND=New debtDR=Debt repayment​\n\n## What Type of Investment Are Capital Expenditures?\n\nCapital expenditures (CapEx) are the investments that companies make to grow or maintain their business operations. Unlike operating expenses, which recur consistently from year to year, capital expenditures are less predictable. For example, a company that buys expensive new equipment would account for that investment as a capital expenditure. Accordingly, it would depreciate the cost of the equipment over the course of its useful life. \n\n## Are Capital Expenditures Tax Deductible?\n\nCapital expenditures are not directly tax deductible. However, they can reduce a company’s taxes indirectly by way of the depreciation that they generate.12 For example, if a company purchases a $1 million piece of equipment that has a useful life of 10 years, it could include $100,000 of depreciation expense each year for 10  years. This depreciation would reduce the company’s pre-tax income by $100,000 per year, thereby reducing their income taxes.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses?\n\nThe key difference between capital expenditures and operating expenses is that operating expenses recur on a regular and predictable basis, such as in the case of rent, wages, and utility costs. Capital expenses, on the other hand, occur much less frequently and with less regularity. Operating expenses are shown on the income statement and are fully tax-deductible, whereas capital expenditures only reduce taxes through the depreciation that they generate.", "timestamp": 1654658771, "digest": "rlL55JACO3ROFtYAznxTfSEp_tbIqmlQsI_uUhEbs_Y", "contributor": "0xD519004F43ccDAD5E429D2478Bd3F001F0880Fb1"}

ETH2.0 生态中。`\n\n\n---\n\n## 01\n\n### 拂晓：ETH2.0 出现的始末\n\n### 起因：为什么要合并？\n\n以太坊的目标是成为世界级计算机，但就目前而言，以太坊仍然面临交易速度缓慢、手续费高昂、PoW 不环保等诸多问题。\n\n* 首先老生常谈的是上面提到的低扩展性。以太坊网络支持数千个去中心化应用程序，每秒都需要处理大量交易，而采用 PoW 共识机制的以太坊 1.0，每秒只能处理约 10-50 笔交易，远小于 PayPal、Visa 等中心化网络，远无法满足用户对于交易速度的需求。\n* 2020 年，DeFi Summer 促使以太坊网络上的交易量大幅增加，DappRadar 2020 Q3 Dapp 报告中指出，以太坊交易量在 2020 年第三季度猛增至 1195 亿美元，与第二季度相比增长了近 1200%。但随着而来的是网络堵塞，交易费猛增。甚至一度平均交易费用达到 14 美元的高度，刷新历史记录。所以，手续费高昂一直是以太坊被诟病的一个重要的点。包括 EOS 创始人 BM 在内的不少人感叹称：对于大多数正常规模的交易来说，以太坊交易费用太高了。\n* 同时被诟病更多的，是 PoW 的高能耗等问题。PoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、布置矿池、消耗电力来获得相应收益。根据以太坊基金会 2021 年 5 月 18 日对 Digiconomist 研究成果的援引，以太坊矿工目前每年消耗 44.49 太瓦时的电量，相当于一个小型国家一年的耗电量。\n\n### 改变：合并可以带来什么？\n\n此次以太坊的合并，是解决以太坊可扩展性问题第 0 阶段，为后续可能到来的分片做铺垫。所以，这次合并升级并不涉及扩容技术，也不会降低以太坊主网高昂的 Gas 费（这个问题需要分片链与 Layer2 技术相结合才得以有效解决）。在当前阶段，将部署信标链，验证者使用权益证明来创建区块。\n\nThe Merge 后的以太坊，主要会增加以下三大特性：\n\n> **1）更公平**\n\n以太坊基金会认为，PoW（工作量证明）机制下，算力投资等级越高，硬件维护能力越高，这让大的资本相比散户来说，拥有更高的资本回报和优势；相比之下采用 PoS 机制，以太坊可以有效降低验证节点的准入门槛，任何用户只要质押 32 枚 ETH 即可加入验证者队伍（要知道 PoW 矿工的投入要远高于这个数字）。验证者的工作包括创建新区块（即矿工），以及检验新区块（未成为矿工），是由信标链随机分配的，不需要比拼算力，对硬件设备的要求大大降低，支持更多用户参与。只需一台普通的笔记本电脑以及一个可靠的、保持在线的互联网连接即可，所有质押者获得的投资回报率更平等，也由于质押者的数量更多，更去中心化。\n\n> **2）更安全**\n\nPoS 很容易从攻击中恢复。V神在《为什么要进行 PoS 》一文中论述到，在基于 GPU 挖矿的 PoW 中，攻击网络的成本仅仅是租用足够的 GPU 赶超现有矿工的成本，只需要花费少量的成本和时间就可以进行攻击工作。比如 ASIC 芯片挖矿需要 1/3 的持续成本(包括更新迭代硬件、维护、电力)和约 2/3 的资本成本。据计算，需要 487 美元左右。ASIC 以高昂的集中化成本提高安全级别，但这种高成本防范攻击使得整个网络趋于中心化，因为矿工加入的门槛也变高了。而在权益证明中，几乎全部是资本成本，即运行节点的成本。随着质押率的提高，攻击成本预计非常高，V神个人预计这个数字最终会上升到 10000 美元左右。\n\n在 PoW 网络中，如果遭到 51% 攻击，唯一的应对措施就是 “等到攻击者主动撤销攻击\"。但这忽略了一种更危险的攻击可能性，这种攻击叫做产卵营攻击(Pawn Camping Attack)，攻击者一次又一次地进行攻击，目的很明确，就是为了使整条链瘫痪。PoS 的情况会好很多。对于某些类型的 51% 攻击(特别是回滚最终确定的区块)，在权益证明中有一个内置的惩罚机制，通过这个机制，攻击者的大部分质押(并不包括其他人的)将被自动销毁。\n\n同时，此次合并升级也正是为最后的分片链上线做准备。分片链的安全性将影响着整个以太坊网络，所以只有当安全性得到有效保障后，才能逐渐上线，分片链的验证者将由信标链随机分配，因为是随机的，所以一条分片链上的验证者难以进行串谋作恶，据以太坊团队介绍，该作恶的可能性小于万亿分之一，分片链的安全得以保障。\n\n> **3）更节能**\n\nPoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、电力和矿池，这导致了对于能源的较大消耗，转化成 PoS 机制后，能够节约超过 95% 的能源消耗，原因是以太坊给质押者的收益只需要消耗少量的网络和电力费用。在全球减碳环保的大背景下，选择不消耗任何能源的 PoS 机制更符合以太坊网络可持续性发展的愿景。\n\n\n---\n\n# 02\n\n### 深入：从矿工到验证者\n\n### 验证者：ETH2.0 中的矿工\n\n在 ETH2.0 中，“矿工”将被“验证者” (validators) 取代，这些验证者需要将 ETH 存入某个以太坊智能合约中 (这一过程称为“质押”(staking))。验证者质押的 ETH 将作为抵押品，以激励他们正确地完成验证工作。不履行验证工作 (比如因为离线) 或进行恶意行为的验证者，将导致其质押的 ETH 的一部分被销毁。另一方面，如果验证者行为得当，那么将会获得 ETH 奖励。\n\n事实上，一个交易被敲定的过程要求验证者进行的“证明”(attestations) 实际上要比上文阐述的要更复杂一些。有两种类型的证明：一种是 LMD GHOST 投票，用于证明区块链的链头；第二种最为重要，是用于对两个检查点进行证明的 FFG 投票 (对区块链进行合理化和最终敲定)。如果验证者接收到的区块是有效的，那么验证者将对区块进行“证明”，实际上就是投票支持将该区块添加到区块链中。一个节点将不定期地被要求提议一个新区块，其他验证者将“证明”该区块。当区块链有多个分叉时，只有那条在其历史上积累了最多“证明” 的链才是正确的区块链。\n\n所有验证者都会对每个检查点进行 FFG 投票，而只有一个随机选中的验证者子集在每个 slot (将区块添加到信标链的机会，每 12 秒出现一次)进行 LMD GHOST 投票。\n\n此外，验证者还将不定期地参与到某个同步委员会 (sync committee) 中，同步委员会是一个由随机选择的 512 名验证者组成的小组，这些被随机选中的验证者将对区块头 (block headers) 进行签名，这样轻客户端就可以检索这些被验证过的区块，而无需访问整条历史链或整个验证者集。\n\n### 验证者参与结果：质押奖励、惩罚和罚没\n\n> **1）奖励**\n\n验证者需要质押的 ETH 用于作为“抵押品”，以激励验证者的诚实行为。随着验证者因为参与到保护网络中而获得奖励，这些被质押的 ETH 将随着时间的推移而增加。当确定验证者的投票合法并有效、且与大多数其他验证者一致时，那么验证者就会获得证明奖励。\n\n当验证者被选中作为“区块提议者”(block proposer) 时，如果其提议的区块被“敲定”， 那么该验证者也将获得奖励。区块提议者也可以通过将有关其他验证者行为不当的证明打包进自己提议的区块中，从而增加自己获得的奖励。\n\n> **2）惩罚**\n\n验证者可能受到的“惩罚”是以各种机制的形式来销毁一部分验证者质押的 ETH。当验证者未能提交一个 FFG 投票、提交延迟了或者提交了错误的 FFG 投票时，都会受到证明惩罚 (attestation penalties)。验证者余额被削减的数额，等同于如果他们提交正确的证明而本可以获得的奖励数额。这意味着，一个诚实但“懒惰”的验证者，他因为错过了证明而遭受到的最大惩罚，就是损失他如果以完美的方式进行证明时本可以获得的奖励金额的 3/4。注意，如果不参与 LMD GHOST 验证是不会受到惩罚的，只是无法得到相应的奖励。\n\n此外，当验证者被分配至“同步委员会”(sync committee) 时，如果该验证者未能签名区块，那么其受到的惩罚将等同于如果他成功地签名区块时本可以获得的 ETH 价值。\n\n> **3）罚没**\n\n罚没 (slashing) 是一种更严重的行为，这会导致验证者被强制从网络中移除，并导致相关的 ETH 质押金损失。\n\n如果检测到严重的违规操作操作，验证者就会罚没。这意味着相当于其质押的 ETH 的 1/64 (最高可达 0.5 ETH) 将立即被销毁，然后进行一个为期 36 天的移除。在此期间，验证者的质押金将逐渐被削减；且在这段期间的中间点 (第18天)，该验证者还将受到额外的惩罚，惩罚大小将与此次罚没事件发生之前的 36 天内所有被罚没的验证者的 ETH 质押总额成比例。\n\n这意味着，当更多的验证者被罚没时，此次罚没的量级将会增加。最大的罚没是所有被罚没的验证者的全部有效余额 (比如，如果有大量验证者被罚没，那么某个验证者可能损失其全部的质押金)。\n\n\n---\n\n# 03\n\n### 浅出：不同参与者如何玩转 ETH2.0\n\n### 对开发者：无缝过渡\n\n在以太坊上工作的开发人员可以“高枕无忧”，因为用于合并前后架构的通用 API 以及对现有组件（如以太坊执行客户端 Geth）的重用，将确保无缝过渡的不间断开发体验。这意味着现有应用程序的返工率很低甚至没有。\n\nPoW 和 PoS 接口的相似之处意味着无需更改 API。利用现有组件还可以确保无需重写智能合约或 dapp 或迁移基础设施。对于依赖随机操作码的 Dapp，可能需要更新一些基础设施。如果您是以太坊开发人员并希望提前开始测试您的 Dapp 和基础设施，鼓励使用最近推出的 Kiln 测试网来进行。增加的客户端选择和灵活性将允许开发人员混合和匹配以满足他们的需求，例如在执行层使用轻量级客户端和在共识层使用重量级 Staking 客户端。\n\n迁移到 PoS 还意味着更可预测的区块时间和费用，这将减少在设计 12 秒区块时间和使用 EIP-1559 建立的 base 费用的高流量解决方案时的不确定性。\n\n### 对普通 Web3 玩家：质押挖矿\n\n在完全切换共识后，以太坊的增发率会低至 2% 以下，增发会远低于目前。PoS 共识下的挖矿和理财比较相近，长期稳定下来的年化收益率预期在 10% 以下，传统矿工一年回本、两年翻倍的模式将不复存在。\n\n可能很多玩家会说，质押 32 ETH 的门槛太高，会导致大部分 PoW 矿工无法参与其中。常言道，有求必有应，需求驱动供给的产生，诸如 Lido 等 Dapp 可以从门槛上进一步降低参与者的准入条件。如今 Lido 的 TVL 已达 195 亿美元，在 DeFi 项目 TVL 总榜中稳居第二，仅次于 Curve。\n\n\n---\n\n**最后**\n\n根据 Bankless 以太坊第一季度报告，仅在 EIP1559 燃烧情况下，ETH 通胀率从 1.10% 下降 至 0.51%。按照目前的质押率，仅考虑转换 PoS，通胀率为 0.5-1%

Assuming the dividend is not raised or lowered, the yield will rise when the price of the stock falls. And conversely, it will fall when the price of the stock rises. Because dividend yields change relative to the stock price, it can often look unusually high for stocks that are falling in value quickly.\n\nNew companies that are relatively small, but still growing quickly, may pay a lower average dividend than mature companies in the same sectors. In general, [mature companies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mature-firm.asp) that aren't growing very quickly pay the highest dividend yields. Consumer non-cyclical stocks that market [staple](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerstaples.asp) items or [utilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utilities_sector.asp) are examples of entire sectors that pay the highest average yield.\n\nAlthough the dividend yield among technology stocks is lower than average, the same general rule that applies to mature companies also applies to the technology sector. For example, as of June 2021, Qualcomm Incorporated ([QCOM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=QCOM)), an established telecommunications equipment manufacturer, had a trailing twelve months ([TTM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp)) dividend of $2.63.1 Using its current price of $144.41 on August 17, 2021, its dividend yield would be 1.82%.2 Meanwhile, Square, Inc. ([SQ](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=SQ)), a relatively newer mobile payments processor, pays no dividends at all.3\n\nIn some cases, the dividend yield may not provide that much information about what kind of dividend the company pays. For example, the average dividend yield in the market is very high amongst [real estate investment trusts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) (REITs). However, those are the yields from [ordinary dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinary-dividends.asp), which are different than [qualified dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp) in that the former is taxed as regular income while the latter is taxed as capital gains.4\n\nAlong with REITs, master limited partnerships (MLPs) and [business development companies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bdc.asp) (BDCs) typically have very high dividend yields. The structure of these companies is such that the U.S. Treasury requires them to pass on the majority of their income to their shareholders.56 This is referred to as a \"pass-through\" process, and it means that the company doesn't have to pay [income taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp) on profits that it distributes as dividends. However, the shareholder has to treat the dividend payments as [ordinary income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp) and pay taxes on them. Dividends from these types of companies (MLPs and BDCs) do not qualify for [capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) treatment.78\n\nWhile the higher tax liability on dividends from ordinary companies lowers the [effective yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectiveyield.asp) the investor has earned, even when adjusted for taxes, REITs, [MLPs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mlp.asp), and BDCs still pay dividends with a higher-than-average yield.\n\n## Calculating the Dividend Yield\n\nThe formula for dividend yield is as follows:\n\nHow to calculate dividend yield. Investopedia \n\nThe dividend yield can be calculated from the last full year's financial report. This is acceptable during the first few months after the company has released its annual report; however, the longer it has been since the annual report, the less relevant that data is for investors. Alternatively, investors can also add the last four quarters of dividends, which captures the trailing 12 months of dividend data. Using a trailing dividend number is acceptable, but it can make the yield too high or too low if the dividend has recently been cut or raised.\n\nBecause dividends are paid quarterly, many investors will take the last quarterly dividend, multiply it by four, and use the product as the annual dividend for the yield calculation. This approach will reflect any recent changes in the dividend, but not all companies pay an even quarterly dividend. Some firms, especially outside the U.S., pay a small quarterly dividend with a large annual dividend. If the dividend calculation is performed after the large dividend distribution, it will give an inflated yield.\n\nFinally, some companies pay a dividend more frequently than quarterly. A monthly dividend could result in a dividend yield calculation that is too low. When deciding how to calculate the dividend yield, an investor should look at the history of dividend payments to decide which method will give the most accurate results.\n\n## Advantages of Dividend Yields\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that a focus on dividends may amplify returns rather than slow them down. For example, according to analysts at Hartford Funds, since 1970, 84% of the total returns from the [S&P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) are from dividends. This assumption is based on the fact that investors are likely to reinvest their dividends back into the S&P 500, which then compounds their ability to earn more dividends in the future.9\n\nFor example, suppose an investor buys $10,000 worth of a stock with a dividend yield of 4% at a rate of a $100 share price. This investor owns 100 shares that all pay a dividend of $4 per share (100 x $4 = $400 total). Assume that the investor uses the $400 in dividends to purchase four more shares. The price would be adjusted on the ex-dividend date by $4 per share to $96 per share. Reinvesting would purchase 4.16 shares; dividend reinvestment programs allow for fractional share purchases. If nothing else changes, the next year the investor will have 104.16 shares worth $10,416. This amount can be reinvested into more shares once a dividend is declared, thus compounding gains similar to a savings account.\n\n## Disadvantages of Dividend Yields\n\nWhile high dividend yields are attractive, it's possible they may be at the expense of the potential growth of the company. It can be assumed that every dollar a company is paying in dividends to its shareholders is a dollar that the company is not reinvesting to grow and generate more [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp). Even without earning any dividends, shareholders have the potential to earn higher returns if the value of their stock increases while they hold it as a result of company growth.\n\nIt's not recommended that investors evaluate a stock based on its dividend yield alone. Dividend data can be old or based on erroneous information. Many companies have a very high yield as their stock is falling. If a company's stock experiences enough of a decline, they may reduce the amount of their dividend, or eliminate it altogether.\n\nInvestors should exercise caution when evaluating a company that looks distressed and has a higher-than-average dividend yield. Because the stock's price is the denominator of the dividend yield equation, a strong [downtrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp) can increase the quotient of the calculation dramatically.\n\nFor example, General Electric Company's ([GE](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GE)) manufacturing and energy divisions began underperforming from 2015 through 2018, and the stock's price fell as [earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) declined. The dividend yield jumped from 3% to more than 5% as the price dropped.10 As you can see in the following chart, the decline in the share price and eventual cut to the dividend offset any benefit of the high dividend yield.\n\n## Dividend Yield vs. Dividend Payout Ratio\n\nWhen [comparing measures of corporate dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111314/what-difference-between-dividend-yield-and-dividend-payout-ratio.asp), it's important to note that the dividend yield tells you what the simple rate of return is in the form of [cash dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashdividend.asp) to shareholders. However, the dividend payout ratio represents how much of a company's net earnings are paid out as dividends. While the dividend yield is the more commonly used term, many believe the dividend payout ratio is a better indicator of a company's ability to distribute dividends consistently in the future. The dividend payout ratio is highly connected to a company's [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp).\n\nThe dividend yield shows how much a company has paid out in dividends over the course of a year. The yield is presented as a percentage, not as an actual dollar amount. This makes it easier to see how much return the shareholder can expect to receive per dollar they have invested.\n\nWhat if you had started investing years ago?\n\nFind out what a hypothetical investment would be worth today.\n\nSELECT A STOCK\n\nTSLA\n\nTESLA INC\n\nAAPL\n\nAPPLE INC\n\nCOKE\n\nCOCA-COLA CONSOLIDATED INC\n\nAMZN\n\nAMAZON.COM, INC\n\nWMT\n\nWALMART INC\n\nSELECT INVESTMENT AMOUNT\n\n$\n\nSELECT A PURCHASE DATE\n\n              2 years ago                      5 years ago                      10 years ago         \n\nCALCULATE\n\n## Example of Dividend Yield \n\nSuppose Company A’s stock is trading at $20 and pays annual dividends of $1 per share to its shareholders. Suppose that Company B's stock is trading at $40 and also pays an annual dividend of $1 per share. \n\nThis means Company A's dividend yield is 5% ($1 / $20), while Company B's dividend yield is only 2.5% ($1 / $40). Assuming all other factors are equivalent, an investor looking to use their [portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) to supplement their income would likely prefer Company A over Company B because it has double the dividend yield.\n\n## What Does the Dividend Yield Tell You?\n\nThe dividend yield is a financial ratio that tells you the percentage of a company’s share price that it pays out in dividends each year. For example, if a company has a $20 share price and pays a dividend of $1 per year, its dividend yield would be 5%. If a company’s dividend yield has been steadily increasing, this could be because they are increasing their dividend, because their share price is declining, or both. Depending on the circumstances, this may be seen as either a positive or a negative sign by investors.\n\n## Is a High Dividend Yield Good?\n\nYield-oriented investors will generally look for companies that offer high dividend yields, but it is important to dig deeper in order to understand the circumstances leading to the high yield. One approach taken by investors is to focus on companies that have a long track record of maintaining or raising their dividends, while also verifying that those companies have the underlying financial strength to continue paying dividends well into the future. To do so, investors can refer to other metrics such as the [current ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp) and the [dividend payout ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendpayoutratio.asp).\n\n## Why Is Dividend Yield Important?\n\nSome investors, such as retirees, are heavily reliant on dividends for their income. For these investors, the dividend yield of their portfolio could have a meaningful effect on their personal finances, making it very important for these investors to select dividend-paying companies with long track records and clear financial strength. For other investors, dividend yield may be less significant, such as for younger investors who are more interested in growth companies that can retain their earnings and use them to finance their growth.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "zkRDCTbHaACFjwhnmdrRcxIgz_q1T8DkJUMniaqbxlQ", "title": "Dividend Payout Ratio", "body": "## What Is a Dividend Payout Ratio?\n\nThe dividend payout ratio is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company. It is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders via dividends. The amount that is not paid to shareholders is retained by the company to pay off debt or to reinvest in core operations. It is sometimes simply referred to as simply the payout ratio.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The dividend payout ratio is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, typically expressed as a percentage. \n* Some companies pay out all their earnings to shareholders, while some only pay out a portion of their earnings.\n* If a company pays out some of its earnings as dividends, the remaining portion is retained by the business—to measure the level of earnings retained, the retention ratio is calculated.\n* Several considerations go into interpreting the dividend payout ratio, most importantly the company's level of maturity.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 27 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:27\n\n#### Dividend Payout Ratio\n\n## Formula and Calculation of Dividend Payout Ratio\n\nThe dividend payout ratio can be calculated as the yearly dividend per share divided by the earnings per share (EPS), or equivalently, the dividends divided by net income (as shown below).\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Dividend Payout Ratio} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Dividends Paid} }{ \\\\text{Net Income} } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Dividend Payout Ratio=Net IncomeDividends Paid​​\n\nAlternatively, the dividend payout ratio can also be calculated as:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Dividend Payout Ratio} = 1 - \\\\text{Retention Ratio} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Dividend Payout Ratio=1−Retention Ratio​\n\nOn a per-share basis, the [retention ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retentionratio.asp) can be expressed as:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{Retention Ratio} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{EPS}-\\\\text{DPS} }{ \\\\text{EPS} } \\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{EPS}=\\\\text{Earnings per share} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{DPS}=\\\\text{Dividends per share}\\\\end{aligned}​Retention Ratio=EPSEPS−DPS​where:EPS=Earnings per shareDPS=Dividends per share​\n\nThe dividend payout ratio provides an indication of how much money a company is returning to [shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) versus how much it is keeping on hand to [reinvest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestment.asp) in growth, pay off debt, or add to cash reserves (retained earnings). \n\n## What the Dividend Payout Ratio Tells You\n\nSeveral considerations go into interpreting the dividend payout ratio, most importantly the company's level of [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp). A new, growth-oriented company that aims to expand, develop new products, and move into new markets would be expected to reinvest most or all of its earnings and could be forgiven for having a [low or even zero payout ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/irrvsnpvcapitalbudgeting.asp). The payout ratio is 0% for companies that do not pay dividends and is 100% for companies that pay out their entire net income as dividends.\n\nOn the other hand, an older, established company that returns a pittance to shareholders would test investors' patience and could tempt [activists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholderactivist.asp) to intervene. In 2012 and after nearly twenty years since its last paid dividend, Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)) began to pay a dividend when the new CEO felt the company's enormous cash flow made a 0% payout ratio difficult to justify.12 Since it implies that a company has moved past its initial growth stage, a high payout ratio means share prices are unlikely to appreciate rapidly.\n\n### Dividend Sustainability\n\nThe payout ratio is also useful for assessing a dividend's sustainability. Companies are extremely reluctant to cut dividends since it can drive the stock price down and reflect poorly on management's abilities. If a company's payout ratio is over 100%, it is returning more money to shareholders than it is earning and will probably be forced to lower the dividend or stop paying it altogether. That result is not inevitable, however.\n\nA company endures a bad year without suspending payouts, and it is often in their interest to do so. It is therefore important to consider future earnings expectations and calculate a forward-looking payout ratio to contextualize the backward-looking one.\n\nLong-term trends in the payout ratio also matter. A steadily rising ratio could indicate a healthy, maturing business, but a spiking one could mean the dividend is heading into unsustainable territory.\n\nThe retention ratio is a converse concept to the dividend payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio evaluates the percentage of profits earned that a company pays out to its shareholders, while the retention ratio represents the percentage of profits earned that are retained by or reinvested in the company.\n\n### Dividends Are Industry Specific\n\nDividend payouts vary widely by industry, and like most ratios, they are most useful to compare within a given industry. [Real estate investment partnerships](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) (REITs), for example, are legally obligated to distribute at least 90% of earnings to shareholders as they enjoy special tax exemptions.3 Master limited partnerships (MLPs) tend to have high payout ratios, as well. \n\nDividends are not the only way companies can return value to shareholders; therefore, the payout ratio does not always provide a complete picture. The augmented payout ratio incorporates share [buybacks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp) into the metric; it is calculated by dividing the sum of dividends and buybacks by net income for the same period. If the result is too high, it can indicate an emphasis on short-term boosts to share prices at the expense of [reinvestment](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/which-option-better-mutual-fund-growth-option-dividend-reinvestment-option/) and long-term growth.\n\nAnother adjustment that can be made to provide a more accurate picture is to subtract [preferred stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) dividends for companies that issue preferred shares.\n\n## How to Calculate the Payout Ratio in Excel\n\nFirst, if you are given the sum of the dividends over a certain period and the outstanding shares, you can calculate the [dividends per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend-per-share.asp) (DPS). Suppose you are invested in a company that paid a total of $5 million last year and it has 5 million shares outstanding. On Microsoft Excel, enter \"Dividends per Share\" into cell A1. Next, enter \"=5000000/5000000\" in cell B1; the dividend per share in this company is $1 per share.\n\nThen, you need to calculate the [earnings per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS) if it is not given. Enter \"Earnings per Share\" into cell A2. Suppose the company had a net income of $50 million last year. The formula for earnings per share is (net income - dividends on preferred stock) ÷ (shares outstanding). Enter \"=(50000000 - 5000000)/5000000\" into cell B2. The EPS for this company is $9.\n\nFinally, calculate the payout ratio: Enter \"Payout Ratio\" into cell A3. Next, enter \"=B1/B2\" into cell B3; the payout ratio is 11.11%. Investors use the ratio to gauge whether dividends are appropriate and sustainable. The payout ratio depends on the sector; for example, startup companies may have a low payout ratio because they are more focused on reinvesting their income to grow the business. \n \n\n## Example of How to Use the Payout Ratio\n\nCompanies that make a profit at the end of a fiscal period can do several things with the profit they earned. They can pay it to shareholders as [dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp), they can retain it to reinvest in the growth of its business, or they can do both. The portion of the profit that a company chooses to pay out to its shareholders can be measured with the payout ratio.\n\nFor example, Apple (AAPL) has paid $0.87 per share in dividends over the [trailing 12 months](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) (TTM) as of Jan. 3, 2022.1 Apple's EPS over the TTM has been as follows:\n\n* **Q1 2021:** $1.704\n* **Q2 2021:** $1.415\n* **Q3 2021:** $1.316\n* **Q4 2021:** $1.257\n\nThe TTM EPS for Apple is $5.67 as of Jan. 3, 2022. Thus, its payout ratio is 15.3%, or $0.87 divided by $5.67.\n\n## Dividend Payout vs. Dividend Yield\n\nWhen [comparing these two measures](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111314/what-difference-between-dividend-yield-and-dividend-payout-ratio.asp), it's important to know that the [dividend yield](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/understanding-dividend-yields/) tells you what the simple rate of return is in the form of [cash dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashdividend.asp) to shareholders, but the dividend payout ratio represents how much of a company's net earnings are paid out as dividends.\n\nWhile the dividend yield is the more commonly known and scrutinized term, many believe the dividend payout ratio is a better indicator of a company's ability to distribute dividends consistently in the future. The dividend payout ratio is highly connected to a company's [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp).\n\nThe dividend yield shows how much a company has paid out in dividends over the course of a year about the stock price. The yield is presented as a percentage, not as an actual dollar amount. This makes it easier to see how much return per dollar invested the shareholder receives through dividends.\n\nThe yield is calculated as:\n\n*\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Dividend Yield} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Annual Dividends per Share} }{ \\\\text{Price per Share} } \\\\end{aligned}​Dividend Yield=Price per ShareAnnual Dividends per Share​​*\n\nFor example, a company that paid out $10 in annual dividends per share on a stock trading at $100 per share has a dividend yield of 10%. You can also see that an [increase in share price](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/how-companys-share-price-determined.asp) reduces the dividend yield percentage and vice versa for a price decline.\n\n## Why Is the Dividend Payout Ratio Important?\n\nThe dividend payout ratio is a key financial metric used to determine the sustainability of a company’s dividend payment program. It is the amount of dividends paid to shareholders relative to the total net income of a company. \n\n## How Do You Calculate the Dividend Payout Ratio?\n\nIt is commonly calculated on a per-share basis by dividing annual dividends per common share by earnings per share (EPS).\n\n## Is a High Dividend Payout Ratio Good?\n\nA high dividend payout ratio is not always valued by active investors. An unusually high dividend payout ratio can indicate that a company is trying to mask a bad business situation from investors by offering extravagant dividends, or that it simply does not plan to aggressively use [working capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) to expand.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between the Dividend Payout Ratio and Dividend Yield?\n\nWhen comparing the two measures of dividends, it's important to know that the dividend yield tells you what the simple rate of return is in the form of cash dividends to shareholders, but the dividend payout ratio represents how much of a company's net earnings are paid out as dividends.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsshGYBt8snAT4CT2A09HTt8lN32HiCbtqFj6mZooRdLnvIRkK2RIi9IJGng4mrfZFoLvk-AJX-JNMuvRp_IzoGySh0YjpUtTErpCwojPLj8uVzcK7QNJW0DRXOp_7THR9ZM5wYJovQ5nVwxOquAm3V3SZhTSBoyc6BEANnE9LBwg0aOQwqpeJROSfGGWGBn0En_bFr0-m71FrhyEHPdqG1sqKFtIkaXBq_IPAE01jK1elFF7s0-4LIrrLuJR5TiNF1wrwb3XhSgXmyUgwlGvb9oXDGfirLQyGdsFC6mg3ZDcIwjGCbKcoIzEX_rsQJJ9hshQo9jLMM3vWceL_1wWKcuUlqWudaAmhcNoZmaVe_KpyE&sig=Cg0ArKJSzBox17Et6Ig3EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsshGYBt8snAT4CT2A09HTt8lN32HiCbtqFj6mZooRdLnvIRkK2RIi9IJGng4mrfZFoLvk-AJX-JNMuvRp_IzoGySh0YjpUtTErpCwojPLj8uVzcK7QNJW0DRXOp_7THR9ZM5wYJovQ5nVwxOquAm3V3SZhTSBoyc6BEANnE9LBwg0aOQwqpeJROSfGGWGBn0En_bFr0-m71FrhyEHPdqG1sqKFtIkaXBq_IPAE01jK1elFF7s0-4LIrrLuJR5TiNF1wrwb3XhSgXmyUgwlGvb9oXDGfirLQyGdsFC6mg3ZDcIwjGCbKcoIzEX_rsQJJ9hshQo9jLMM3vWceL_1wWKcuUlqWudaAmhcNoZmaVe_KpyE&sig=Cg0ArKJSzBox17Et6Ig3EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "0bA1r3UteCZfr8F6abtOO85fPm6-StqBg6LSm4fcOhM", "title": "Due Diligence", "body": "## What Is Due Diligence?\n\nDue diligence is an investigation, [audit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp), or review performed to confirm facts or details of a matter under consideration. In the financial world, due diligence requires an examination of financial records before entering into a proposed transaction with another party.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Due diligence is a systematic way to analyze and mitigate risk from a business or investment decision.\n* An individual investor can conduct due diligence on any stock using readily available public information.\n* The same due diligence strategy will work on many other types of investments.\n* Due diligence involves examining a company's numbers, comparing the numbers over time, and benchmarking them against competitors.\n* Due diligence is applied in many other contexts, for example, conducting a background check on a potential employee or reading product reviews.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 38 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:38\n\n#### Due Diligence\n\n## Understanding Due Diligence\n\nDue diligence became common practice (and a common term) in the United States with the passage of the [Securities Act of 1933](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitiesact1933.asp). With that law, securities dealers and [brokers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) became responsible for fully disclosing material information about the instruments they were selling. Failing to disclose this information to potential investors made dealers and brokers liable for criminal prosecution.1\n\nThe writers of the act recognized that requiring full [disclosure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disclosure.asp) left dealers and brokers vulnerable to unfair prosecution for failing to disclose a material fact they did not possess or could not have known at the time of sale. Thus, the act included a legal defense: as long as the dealers and brokers exercised \"due diligence\" when investigating the companies whose equities they were selling, and fully disclosed the results, they could not be held liable for information that was not discovered during the investigation.\n\n## Types of Due Diligence\n\nDue diligence is performed by [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) research analysts, fund managers, broker-dealers, individual investors, and companies that are considering acquiring other companies. Due diligence by individual investors is voluntary. However, broker-dealers are legally obligated to conduct due diligence on a security before selling it.\n\n## How to Perform Due Diligence for Stocks\n\nBelow are 10 steps for individual investors undertaking due diligence. Most are related to stocks, but, in many cases, they can be applied to [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), real estate, and many other investments.\n\nAfter those 10 steps, we offer some tips when considering an investment in a startup company.\n\nAll of the information you need is readily available in the company's quarterly and [annual reports](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annualreport.asp) and in the company profiles on financial news and discount brokerage sites.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Capitalization of the Company \n\nA company’s [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), or total value, indicates how volatile the stock price is, how broad its ownership is, and the potential size of the company's target markets.\n\nLarge-cap and mega-cap companies tend to have stable revenue streams and a large, diverse investor base, which tends to lead to less volatility. Mid-cap and small-cap companies typically have greater fluctuations in their stock prices and [earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) than large corporations.\n\n### Step 2: Revenue, Profit, and Margin Trends\n\nThe company's income statement will list its revenue or its [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) or profit. That's the bottom line. It's important to monitor trends over time in a company's revenue, operating expenses, [profit margins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp), and [return on equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp).\n\nThe company's profit margin is calculated by dividing its net income by its revenue. It's best to analyze profit margin over several quarters or years and compare those results to companies within the same industry to gain some perspective.\n\n### Step 3: Competitors and Industries\n\nNow that you have a feel for how big the company is and how much it earns, it's time to size up the industry in which it operates and its competition. Every company is defined in part by its competition. Due diligence involves comparing the profit margins of a company with two or three of its competitors. For example, questions to ask are: Is the company a leader in its industry or its specific target markets? Is the company's industry growing?\n\nPerforming due diligence on several companies in the same industry can give an investor significant insight into how the industry is performing and which companies have the leading edge in that industry.\n\n### Step 4: Valuation Multiples\n\nMany [ratios](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0910/6-basic-financial-ratios-and-what-they-tell-you.aspx) and financial metrics are used to evaluate companies, but three of the most useful are the [price-to-earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) (P/E) ratio, the [price/earnings to growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) (PEGs) ratio, and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. These ratios are already calculated for you on websites such as Yahoo! Finance.\n\nAs you research ratios for a company, compare several of its competitors. You might find yourself becoming more interested in a competitor.\n\n* The P/E ratio gives you a general sense of how much expectation is built into the company's stock price. It's a good idea to examine this ratio over a few years to make sure that the current quarter isn't an aberration.\n* The [price-to-book (P/B) ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp), the enterprise multiple, and the price-to-sales (or revenue) ratio measure the valuation of the company in relation to its debt, annual revenues, and balance sheet. Peer comparison is important here because the healthy ranges differ from industry to industry.\n* The PEG ratio suggests expectations among investors for the company's future earnings growth and how it compares to the current earnings multiple. Stocks with PEG ratios close to one are considered fairly valued under normal market conditions.\n\n### Step 5: Management and Share Ownership\n\nIs the company still run by its founders, or has the board shuffled in a lot of new faces? Younger companies tend to be founder-led. Research the bios of management to find out their level of expertise and experience. Bio information can be found on the company's website.\n\n### P/E ratio\n\n*The P/E ratio gives a sense of the expectations that investors have for the stock's near-term performance.*\n\nWhether founders and executives hold a high proportion of shares and whether they have been selling shares recently is a significant factor in due diligence. High ownership by top managers is a plus, and low ownership is a red flag. Shareholders tend to be best served when those running the company have a vested interest in stock performance.\n\n### Step 6: Balance Sheet\n\nThe company's consolidated [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) will show its assets and liabilities as well as how much cash is available.\n\nCheck the company's level of [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp) and how it compares to others in the industry. Debt is not necessarily a bad thing, depending on the company's business model and industry. But make sure those debts are highly rated by the rating agencies.\n\nSome companies and whole industries, like oil and gas, are very [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) intensive while others require few fixed assets and capital investment. Determine the debt-to-equity ratio to see how much positive equity the company has. Typically, the more cash a company generates, the better an investment it's likely to be because the company can meet its debts and still grow.\n\nIf the figures for total assets, total liabilities, and [stockholders' equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockholdersequity.asp) change substantially from one year to the next, try to figure out why. Reading the footnotes that accompany the [financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) and the management's discussion in the quarterly or annual reports can shed light on what's really happening in a company. The firm could be preparing for a new product launch, accumulating [retained earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp), or in a state of financial decline.\n\n### Step 7: Stock Price History\n\nInvestors should research both the short-term and long-term price movements of the stock and whether the stock has been volatile or steady. Compare the profits generated historically and determine how it correlates with the price movement.\n\nKeep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future price movements. If you're a retiree looking for dividends, for example, you might not want a volatile stock price. Stocks that are continuously volatile tend to have short-term shareholders, which can add extra risk for certain investors.\n\n### Step 8: Stock Dilution Possibilities\n\nInvestors should know how many shares outstanding the company has and how that number relates to the competition. Is the company planning on issuing more shares? If so, the stock price might take a hit.\n\n### Step 9: Expectations\n\nInvestors should find out what the [consensus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensusestimate.asp) of Wall Street analysts is for earnings growth, revenue, and profit estimates for the next two to three years. Investors should also look for discussions of long-term trends affecting the industry and company-specific news about partnerships, [joint ventures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp), [intellectual property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp), and new products or services.\n\n### Step 10: Examine Long and Short-Term Risks\n\nBe sure to understand both the industry-wide risks and company-specific risks. Are there outstanding legal or regulatory matters? Is there unsteady management?\n\nInvestors should play devil's advocate at all times, picturing worst-case scenarios and their potential outcomes on the stock. If a new product fails or a competitor brings a new and better product forward, how would this affect the company? How would a jump in interest rates affect the company?\n\nOnce you've completed the steps outlined above, you'll have a better sense of the company's performance and how it stacks up to the competition. You will be better informed to make a sound decision.\n\n## Due Diligence Basics for Startup Investments\n\nWhen considering investing in a [startup](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp), some of the 10 steps above are appropriate while others just aren't possible because the company doesn't have the track record. Here are some startup-specific moves.\n\n* Include an exit strategy. More than 90% of [startups fail](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp#:\\~:text=Key%20Takeaways&text=In%202019%2C%20the%20failure%20rate,70%25%20in%20their%2010th%20year.&text=Ways%20to%20avoid%20failing%20include,the%20work%2C%20and%20not%20quitting.).2 Plan a strategy to recover your money should the business fail.\n* Consider entering into a partnership: Partners split the capital and risk, so they lose less if the business fails.\n* Figure out the [harvest strategy ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harvest-strategy.asp)for your investment. Promising businesses may fail due to a change in technology, government policy, or market conditions. Be on the lookout for new trends, technologies, and brands, and get ready to harvest when you find that the business may not thrive with the changes.\n* Choose a startup with promising products. Since most investments are harvested after five years, it is advisable to invest in products that have an increasing [return on investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) (ROI) for that period.\n* In lieu of hard numbers on past performance, look at the growth plan of the business and evaluate whether it appears to be realistic.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nIn the [mergers and acquisitions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) (M&A) world, there is a delineation between \"hard\" and \"soft\" forms of due diligence.\n\n\"Hard\" due diligence is concerned with the numbers. \"Soft\" due diligence is concerned with the people within the company and in its customer base.\n\nIn traditional M&A activity, the acquiring firm deploys risk analysts who perform due diligence by studying costs, benefits, structures, assets, and liabilities. That's known colloquially as hard due diligence.\n\nIncreasingly, however, M&A deals are also subject to the study of a company's culture, management, and other human elements. That's known as soft due diligence.\n\nHard due diligence, which is driven by mathematics and legalities, is susceptible to rosy interpretations by eager salespeople. Soft due diligence acts as a counterbalance when the numbers are being manipulated or overemphasized.\n\nThere are many drivers of business success that numbers cannot fully capture, such as employee relationships, corporate culture, and leadership. When M&A deals fail, as more than 50% of them do, it is often because the human element is ignored.\n\nThe contemporary business analysis calls this element [human capital](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/younginvestors/09/human-capital.asp). The corporate world started taking notice of its significance in the mid-2000s. In 2007, the *Harvard Business Review* dedicated part of its April issue to what it called \"human capital due diligence,\" warning that companies ignore it at their peril.3\n\n### Performing Hard Due Diligence\n\nIn an M&A deal, hard due diligence is the battlefield of lawyers, accountants, and negotiators. Typically, hard due diligence focuses on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the aging of receivables, and payables, cash flow, and capital expenditures.\n\nIn sectors such as technology or manufacturing, additional focus is placed on intellectual property and [physical capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physical-capital.asp).\n\nOther examples of hard due diligence activities include:\n\n* Reviewing and auditing financial statements\n* Scrutinizing projections for future performance\n* Analyzing the consumer market\n* Seeking operating redundancies that can be eliminated\n* Reviewing potential or ongoing litigation\n* Reviewing antitrust considerations\n* Evaluating subcontractor and other third-party relationships\n\n### Performing Soft Due Diligence\n\nConducting soft due diligence is not an exact science. It should focus on how well a targeted workforce will mesh with the acquiring corporation's culture.\n\nHard and soft due diligence intertwine when it comes to compensation and incentive programs. These programs are not only based on real numbers, making them easy to incorporate into post-acquisition planning, but they can also be discussed with employees and used to gauge cultural impact.\n\nSoft due diligence is concerned with employee motivation, and compensation packages are specifically constructed to boost those motivations. It is not a panacea or a cure-all, but soft due diligence can help the acquiring firm predict whether a compensation program can be implemented to improve the success of a deal.\n\nSoft due diligence can also concern itself with the target company's customers. Even if the target employees accept the cultural and operational shifts from the takeover, the target customers and clients may well resent a change in service, products, or procedures. This is why many M&A analyses now include customer reviews, supplier reviews, and test market data.\n\n## Due Diligence FAQs\n\n### What Exactly Is Due Diligence?\n\nDue diligence is a process or effort to collect and analyze information before making a decision. It is a process often used by investors to assess risk. It involves examining a company's numbers, comparing the numbers over time, and benchmarking them against competitors to assess an investment's potential in terms of growth.\n\n### What Is the Purpose of Due Diligence?\n\nDue diligence is primarily a way to reduce exposure to risk. The process ensures that a party is aware of all the details of a transaction before they agree to it. For example, a broker-dealer will give an investor the results of a due diligence report so that the investor is fully informed and cannot hold the broker-dealer responsible for any losses.\n\n### What Are the Types of Due Diligence?\n\nDepending on its purpose, due diligence takes different forms. A company that is considering an M&A will perform a financial analysis on a target company. The due diligence might also include an analysis of future growth. The acquirer may ask questions that address the structuring of the acquisition. The acquirer is also likely to look at the current practices and policies of the target company and perform a shareholder value analysis. Due diligence can be categorized as \"hard\" due diligence, which is concerned with the numbers on the financial statements, and \"soft\" due diligence, which is concerned with the people within the company and its customer base.\n\n### What Is a Due Diligence Checklist?\n\nA [due diligence checklist](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/due-diligence.asp) is an organized way to analyze a company. The checklist will include all the areas to be analyzed, such as ownership and organization, assets and operations, the financial ratios, shareholder value, processes and policies, future growth potential, management, and human resources.\n\n### What Is a Due Diligence Example?\n\nExamples of due diligence can be found in many areas of our daily lives. For example, conducting a property inspection before completing a purchase to assess the risk of the investment, an acquiring company that examines a target firm before completing a merger or acquisition, and an employer performing a background check on a potential recruit.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nDue diligence is a process or effort to collect and analyze information before making a decision or conducting a transaction so a party is not held legally liable for any loss or damage. The term applies to [many situations](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfunds/09/hedge-fund-due-diligence.asp) but most notably to business transactions. Due diligence is performed by investors who want to minimize risk, broker-dealers who want to ensure that a party to any transaction is fully informed of the details so that the broker-dealer is not held responsible, and companies who are considering acquiring another firm. Fundamentally, doing your due diligence means that you have gathered the necessary facts to make a wise and informed decision.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "0QULUZtompAQ8GwrXjEsykjg8cI7BLxhGNNVwTgll9Q", "title": "Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)", "body": "## What Is a Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)?\n\nA zero-coupon inflation swap (ZCIS) is a type of [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) in which a fixed-rate payment on a notional amount is exchanged for a payment at the rate of inflation. It is an exchange of cash flows that allows investors to either reduce or increase their exposure to the changes in the purchasing power of money.\n\nA ZCIS is sometimes known as a breakeven inflation swap.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A zero-coupon inflation swap (ZCIS) is a type of inflation derivative, where an income stream that is tied to the rate of inflation is exchanged for an income stream with a fixed interest rate.\n* With a ZCIS, both income streams are paid as a single lump sum when the swap reaches maturity and the inflation level is known, instead of exchanging periodic payments.\n* As inflation rises, the inflation buyer receives more from the inflation seller than what they paid.\n* Conversely, if inflation falls, the inflation buyer receives less from the inflation seller than what they paid.\n\n## Understanding a Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)\n\nAn [inflation swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation-swap.asp) is a contract used to transfer inflation risk from one party to another through an exchange of fixed cash flows. In a ZCIS, which is a basic type of inflation derivative, an income stream tied to the rate of inflation is exchanged for an income stream with a fixed interest rate. A [zero-coupon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp) security does not make periodic interest payments during the life of the investment. Instead, a lump sum is paid on the [maturity date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp) to the holder of the security.\n\nLikewise, with a ZCIS, both income streams are paid as one lump-sum payment when the swap reaches maturity and the inflation level is known. The payoff at maturity depends on the [inflation rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) realized over a given period of time, as measured by an inflation index. In effect, the ZCIS is a bilateral contract used to provide a [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) against inflation.\n\nWhile payment is typically exchanged at the end of the swap term, a buyer may choose to sell the swap on the [over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) market prior to maturity.\n\nUnder a ZCIS, the inflation receiver, or buyer, pays a predetermined fixed rate and, in return, receives an inflation-linked payment from the inflation payer, or seller. The side of the contract that pays a fixed rate is referred to as the fixed leg, while the other end of the derivatives contract is the inflation leg. The fixed-rate is called the breakeven swap rate.\n\nThe payments from both legs capture the difference between expected and actual inflation. If actual inflation exceeds expected inflation, the resulting positive return to the buyer is considered a [capital gain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp). As inflation rises, the buyer earns more; if inflation falls, the buyer earns less.\n\n## Computing the Price of a Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)\n\nThe inflation buyer pays a fixed amount, known as the fixed leg. This is:\n\n> *Fixed Leg = A \\* \\[(1 + r)t – 1\\]*\n\nThe inflation seller pays an amount given by the change in the inflation index, known as the inflation leg. This is:\n\n> *Inflation Leg = A \\* \\[(IE ÷ IS) – 1\\]*\n\nwhere**:**\n\n* A = Reference [notional](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalvalue.asp) of the swap\n* r = The fixed rate\n* t = The number of years\n* IE = Inflation index at the end (maturity) date\n* IS = Inflation index at the start date\n\n## Example of a Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)\n\nAssume that two parties enter into a five-year ZCIS with a notional amount of $100 million, a 2.4% fixed rate, and the agreed-upon inflation index, such as the [Consumer Price Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp) (CPI), at 2.0% when the swap is agreed upon. At maturity, the inflation index is at 2.5%.\n\n*Fixed Leg* = $100,000,000 \\* \\[(1.024)5 – 1)\\] = $100,000,000 \\* \\[1.1258999 – 1\\]\n\n= $12,589,990.68\n\n*Inflation Leg* = $100,000,000 \\* \\[(0.025 ÷ 0.020) – 1\\] = $100,000,000 \\* \\[1.25 – 1\\]\n\n= $25,000,000.00\n\nSince the compounded inflation rate rose above 2.4%, the inflation buyer profited; otherwise, the inflation seller would have profited.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nThe currency of the swap determines the price index that is used to calculate the rate of inflation. For example, a swap denominated in U.S. dollars would be based on the CPI, a proxy for inflation that measures price changes in a basket of goods and services in the United States. A swap denominated in British pounds, meanwhile, would typically be based on Great Britain's [Retail Price Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rpi.asp) (RPI).\n\nLike every debt contract, a ZCIS is subject to the [risk of default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp) from either party, either because of temporary liquidity problems or more significant structural issues, such as insolvency. To mitigate this risk, both parties may agree to put up [collateral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp) for the amount due.\n\nOther financial instruments that can be used to hedge against inflation risk are real yield inflation swaps, price index inflation swaps, [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp) (TIPS), municipal and corporate [inflation-linked securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation-indexedsecurity.asp), inflation-linked certificates of deposit, and inflation-linked savings bonds.\n\n## Benefits of Inflation Swaps\n\nThe advantage of an inflation swap is that it provides an analyst with a fairly accurate estimation of what the market considers to be the 'break-even' inflation rate. Conceptually, it is very similar to the way that a market sets the price for any commodity, namely the agreement between a buyer and a seller (between demand and supply), to transact at a specified rate. In this case, the specified rate is the expected rate of inflation.\n\nSimply put, the two parties to the swap come to an agreement based on their respective takes on what the inflation rate is likely to be for the period of time in question. As with [interest rate swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp), the parties exchange cash flows based on a notional principal amount (this amount is not actually exchanged), but instead of hedging against or speculating on [interest rate risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp), their focus is solely on the inflation rate.", "timestamp": 1654659074, "digest": "fbaIN-Wy6Lbme6t_WgvdeLHHzx7xVD4mEn8cMGoifGM", "contributor": "0x1E31CCC863220CBBC6aBC9454151ddBfdEfd6Cf2"}

通过更深入地将我们联系在一起和消除权力中心及其固有的缺点，将使 Web3 社会更加繁荣。`\n>\n> `作为区块链或者说 Web3 的参与者，无论是作为开发者、矿工还是科学家等等，都有必要深入的了解此次升级所带来的影响，以及如何迅速融入升级后的 yield & defi。本文将系统的阐述 ETH1.0 到 ETH2.0 转型的始末，阐明 ETH2.0 所做出的改变内容，以及帮助参与者无缝过渡到 ETH2.0 生态中。`\n\n\n---\n\n## 01\n\n### 拂晓：ETH2.0 出现的始末\n\n### 起因：为什么要合并？\n\n以太坊的目标是成为世界级计算机，但就目前而言，以太坊仍然面临交易速度缓慢、手续费高昂、PoW 不环保等诸多问题。\n\n* 首先老生常谈的是上面提到的低扩展性。以太坊网络支持数千个去中心化应用程序，每秒都需要处理大量交易，而采用 PoW 共识机制的以太坊 1.0，每秒只能处理约 10-50 笔交易，远小于 PayPal、Visa 等中心化网络，远无法满足用户对于交易速度的需求。\n* 2020 年，DeFi Summer 促使以太坊网络上的交易量大幅增加，DappRadar 2020 Q3 Dapp 报告中指出，以太坊交易量在 2020 年第三季度猛增至 1195 亿美元，与第二季度相比增长了近 1200%。但随着而来的是网络堵塞，交易费猛增。甚至一度平均交易费用达到 14 美元的高度，刷新历史记录。所以，手续费高昂一直是以太坊被诟病的一个重要的点。包括 EOS 创始人 BM 在内的不少人感叹称：对于大多数正常规模的交易来说，以太坊交易费用太高了。\n* 同时被诟病更多的，是 PoW 的高能耗等问题。PoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、布置矿池、消耗电力来获得相应收益。根据以太坊基金会 2021 年 5 月 18 日对 Digiconomist 研究成果的援引，以太坊矿工目前每年消耗 44.49 太瓦时的电量，相当于一个小型国家一年的耗电量。\n\n### 改变：合并可以带来什么？\n\n此次以太坊的合并，是解决以太坊可扩展性问题第 0 阶段，为后续可能到来的分片做铺垫。所以，这次合并升级并不涉及扩容技术，也不会降低以太坊主网高昂的 Gas 费（这个问题需要分片链与 Layer2 技术相结合才得以有效解决）。在当前阶段，将部署信标链，验证者使用权益证明来创建区块。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9-n_FT_hG3Jo7GCOLQjoV.png?height=611&width=1080)\n\nThe Merge 后的以太坊，主要会增加以下三大特性：\n\n> **1）更公平**\n\n以太坊基金会认为，PoW（工作量证明）机制下，算力投资等级越高，硬件维护能力越高，这让大的资本相比散户来说，拥有更高的资本回报和优势；相比之下采用 PoS 机制，以太坊可以有效降低验证节点的准入门槛，任何用户只要质押 32 枚 ETH 即可加入验证者队伍（要知道 PoW 矿工的投入要远高于这个数字）。验证者的工作包括创建新区块（即矿工），以及检验新区块（未成为矿工），是由信标链随机分配的，不需要比拼算力，对硬件设备的要求大大降低，支持更多用户参与。只需一台普通的笔记本电脑以及一个可靠的、保持在线的互联网连接即可，所有质押者获得的投资回报率更平等，也由于质押者的数量更多，更去中心化。\n\n> **2）更安全**\n\nPoS 很容易从攻击中恢复。V神在《为什么要进行 PoS 》一文中论述到，在基于 GPU 挖矿的 PoW 中，攻击网络的成本仅仅是租用足够的 GPU 赶超现有矿工的成本，只需要花费少量的成本和时间就可以进行攻击工作。比如 ASIC 芯片挖矿需要 1/3 的持续成本(包括更新迭代硬件、维护、电力)和约 2/3 的资本成本。据计算，需要 487 美元左右。ASIC 以高昂的集中化成本提高安全级别，但这种高成本防范攻击使得整个网络趋于中心化，因为矿工加入的门槛也变高了。而在权益证明中，几乎全部是资本成本，即运行节点的成本。随着质押率的提高，攻击成本预计非常高，V神个人预计这个数字最终会上升到 10000 美元左右。\n\n在 PoW 网络中，如果遭到 51% 攻击，唯一的应对措施就是 “等到攻击者主动撤销攻击\"。但这忽略了一种更危险的攻击可能性，这种攻击叫做产卵营攻击(Pawn Camping Attack)，攻击者一次又一次地进行攻击，目的很明确，就是为了使整条链瘫痪。PoS 的情况会好很多。对于某些类型的 51% 攻击(特别是回滚最终确定的区块)，在权益证明中有一个内置的惩罚机制，通过这个机制，攻击者的大部分质押(并不包括其他人的)将被自动销毁。\n\n同时，此次合并升级也正是为最后的分片链上线做准备。分片链的安全性将影响着整个以太坊网络，所以只有当安全性得到有效保障后，才能逐渐上线，分片链的验证者将由信标链随机分配，因为是随机的，所以一条分片链上的验证者难以进行串谋作恶，据以太坊团队介绍，该作恶的可能性小于万亿分之一，分片链的安全得以保障。\n\n> **3）更节能**\n\nPoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、电力和矿池，这导致了对于能源的较大消耗，转化成 PoS 机制后，能够节约超过 95% 的能源消耗，原因是以太坊给质押者的收益只需要消耗少量的网络和电力费用。在全球减碳环保的大背景下，选择不消耗任何能源的 PoS 机制更符合以太坊网络可持续性发展的愿景。\n\n\n---\n\n# 02\n\n### 深入：从矿工到验证者\n\n### 验证者：ETH2.0 中的矿工\n\n在 ETH2.0 中，“矿工”将被“验证者” (validators) 取代，这些验证者需要将 ETH 存入某个以太坊智能合约中 (这一过程称为“质押”(staking))。验证者质押的 ETH 将作为抵押品，以激励他们正确地完成验证工作。不履行验证工作 (比如因为离线) 或进行恶意行为的验证者，将导致其质押的 ETH 的一部分被销毁。另一方面，如果验证者行为得当，那么将会获得 ETH 奖励。\n\n事实上，一个交易被敲定的过程要求验证者进行的“证明”(attestations) 实际上要比上文阐述的要更复杂一些。有两种类型的证明：一种是 LMD GHOST 投票，用于证明区块链的链头；第二种最为重要，是用于对两个检查点进行证明的 FFG 投票 (对区块链进行合理化和最终敲定)。如果验证者接收到的区块是有效的，那么验证者将对区块进行“证明”，实际上就是投票支持将该区块添加到区块链中。一个节点将不定期地被要求提议一个新区块，其他验证者将“证明”该区块。当区块链有多个分叉时，只有那条在其历史上积累了最多“证明” 的链才是正确的区块链。\n\n所有验证者都会对每个检查点进行 FFG 投票，而只有一个随机选中的验证者子集在每个 slot (将区块添加到信标链的机会，每 12 秒出现一次)进行 LMD GHOST 投票。\n\n此外，验证者还将不定期地参与到某个同步委员会 (sync committee) 中，同步委员会是一个由随机选择的 512 名验证者组成的小组，这些被随机选中的验证者将对区块头 (block headers) 进行签名，这样轻客户端就可以检索这些被验证过的区块，而无需访问整条历史链或整个验证者集。\n\n### 验证者参与结果：质押奖励、惩罚和罚没\n\n> **1）奖励**\n\n验证者需要质押的 ETH 用于作为“抵押品”，以激励验证者的诚实行为。随着验证者因为参与到保护网络中而获得奖励，这些被质押的 ETH 将随着时间的推移而增加。当确定验证者的投票合法并有效、且与大多数其他验证者一致时，那么验证者就会获得证明奖励。\n\n当验证者被选中作为“区块提议者”(block proposer) 时，如果其提议的区块被“敲定”， 那么该验证者也将获得奖励。区块提议者也可以通过将有关其他验证者行为不当的证明打包进自己提议的区块中，从而增加自己获得的奖励。\n\n> **2）惩罚**\n\n验证者可能受到的“惩罚”是以各种机制的形式来销毁一部分验证者质押的 ETH。当验证者未能提交一个 FFG 投票、提交延迟了或者提交了错误的 FFG 投票时，都会受到证明惩罚 (attestation penalties)。验证者余额被削减的数额，等同于如果他们提交正确的证明而本可以获得的奖励数额。这意味着，一个诚实但“懒惰”的验证者，他因为错过了证明而遭受到的最大惩罚，就是损失他如果以完美的方式进行证明时本可以获得的奖励金额的 3/4。注意，如果不参与 LMD GHOST 验证是不会受到惩罚的，只是无法得到相应的奖励。\n\n此外，当验证者被分配至“同步委员会”(sync committee) 时，如果该验证者未能签名区块，那么其受到的惩罚将等同于如果他成功地签名区块时本可以获得的 ETH 价值。\n\n> **3）罚没**\n\n罚没 (slashing) 是一种更严重的行为，这会导致验证者被强制从网络中移除，并导致相关的 ETH 质押金损失。\n\n如果检测到严重的违规操作操作，验证者就会罚没。这意味着相当于其质押的 ETH 的 1/64 (最高可达 0.5 ETH) 将立即被销毁，然后进行一个为期 36 天的移除。在此期间，验证者的质押金将逐渐被削减；且在这段期间的中间点 (第18天)，该验证者还将受到额外的惩罚，惩罚大小将与此次罚没事件发生之前的 36 天内所有被罚没的验证者的 ETH 质押总额成比例。\n\n这意味着，当更多的验证者被罚没时，此次罚没的量级将会增加。最大的罚没是所有被罚没的验证者的全部有效余额 (比如，如果有大量验证者被罚没，那么某个验证者可能损失其全部的质押金)。\n\n\n---\n\n# 03\n\n### 浅出：不同参与者如何玩转 ETH2.0\n\n### 对开发者：无缝过渡\n\n在以太坊上工作的开发人员可以“高枕无忧”，因为用于合并前后架构的通用 API 以及对现有组件（如以太坊执行客户端 Geth）的重用，将确保无缝过渡的不间断开发体验。这意味着现有应用程序的返工率很低甚至没有。\n\nPoW 和 PoS 接口的相似之处意味着无需更改 API。利用现有组件还可以确保无需重写智能合约或 dapp 或迁移基础设施。对于依赖随机操作码的 Dapp，可能需要更新一些基础设施。如果您是以太坊开发人员并希望提前开始测试您的 Dapp 和基础设施，鼓励使用最近推出的 Kiln 测试网来进行。增加的客户端选择和灵活性将允许开发人员混合和匹配以满足他们的需求，例如在执行层使用轻量级客户端和在共识层使用重量级 Staking 客户端。\n\n迁移到 PoS 还意味着更可预测的区块时间和费用，这将减少在设计 12 秒区块时间和使用 EIP-1559 建立的 base 费用的高流量解决方案时的不确定性。\n\n### 对普通 Web3 玩家：质押挖矿\n\n在完全切换共识后，以太坊的增发率会低至 2% 以下，增发会远低于目前。PoS 共识下的挖矿和理财比较相近，长期稳定下来的年化收益率预期在 10% 以下，传统矿工一年回本、两年翻倍的模式将不复存在。\n\n可能很多玩家会说，质押 32 ETH 的门槛太高，会导致大部分 PoW 矿工无法参与其中。常言道，有求必有应，需求驱动供给的产生，诸如 Lido 等 Dapp 可以从门槛上进一步降低参与者的准入条件。如今 Lido 的 TVL 已达 195 亿美元，在 DeFi 项目 TVL 总榜中稳居第二，仅次于 Curve。\n\n\n---\n\n**最后**\n\n根据 Bankless 以太坊第一季度报告，仅在 EIP1559 燃烧情况下，ETH 通胀率从 1.10% 下降 至 0.51%。按照目前的质押率，仅考虑转换 PoS，通胀率为 0.5-1% 左右，低于比特币的通胀率。两者叠加，ETH 既有可能进入通缩状态，将利好 ETH 价格。\n\n合并过程或许不会一切顺利。首先合并后 PoW 矿机节点将全部下线，许多矿工可能会在合并之前退出网络，合并发生后也极有可能出现分叉。其次，如此重大的技术升级，也可能出现服务错误和黑客攻击。\n\n在过去几年中，我们看到以太坊引领了 DeFi、NFT 等创新趋势，同时以太坊在提升性能方面从未停止脚步，PoS 合并会是这一进程中的重要一步。在元宇宙叙事的 Web3.0 下，以太坊是否能保持龙头公链的地位，建立一个更强壮的体验与生态，引入更多用户的参与，期待以太坊生态会有更好的表现。\n\n\n---\n\n**参考**\n\nhttps://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/state-of-ethereum-q1-2022?s=r\n[https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PNXIzQdaMmLMyn7f7WMeuw](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUyNzE4MDM2MA==&mid=2247517370&idx=1&sn=b8e003a93fd2b4ad7bdfb78ec74399c9&scene=21#wechat_redirect)\n\n\n---\n\n**END**\n\n· **关于 SnapFingers

Corresponde a cerca de 3x e 9x o número de processos em 2018 e 2017, respectivamente*\n\nA **Amazon** e a **Google** foram os principais alvos de activismo tecnológico entre 2006 e 2019. Quando agrupadas, as empresas de taxi **Uber**, Lyft e Bolt seguiram-se na lista. Enquanto que a **Amazon** e as empresas de taxi foram maioritariamente denunciadas por trabalhadores de colarinho azul, a **Google** e a **Microsoft** foram-o por trabalhadores de colarinho branco (e.g, lê sobre a grande manifestação 2018 dos trabalhadores da Google [neste artigo](https://mirror.xyz/0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b/W8HwwSOAR8joT3q2mHuUmoMIiHaNEe6Fuc-_gciVrGE)).\n\n> *Tem-se discutido que as ações dos **trabalhadores de colarinho branco** têm sido motivadas por razões **morais /** éticas*\n\nEm 2019, a **Facebook** foi atingida por uma multa de 5 Biliões $, a mais elevada alguma vez cobrada pela *Federal Trade Commission* (FTC), por “enganarem” os utilizadores sobre a possibilidade de manter privada a sua informação pessoal, depois de um longo ano de investigações àcerca da fuga de dados pela Cambridge Analytica ([ref](https://archive.ph/Du9OS)). **Cambridge Analytica** é a empresa de análise de dados que trabalhou com a equipa eleitoral de Donald Trump (e com a campanha vencedora do Brexit) para recolher dados **do Facebook de 50 milhões de eleitores Americanos**, com o objectivo de influenciar, via anúncios políticos personalizados, a decisão dos eleitores nas urnas.\n\nEm 2019, um grupo de criadores do YouTube processou a **YouTube** por alegada discriminação contra os seus vídeos sobre a **LGBTQ**, suprimindo a sua recomendação a outros utilizadores e dificultando a receita resultante de anúncios. O processo judicial alegou também que tanto as ferramentas de *Machine Learning* como os moderadores de conteúdo visavam, de forma injusta, canais que exibissem as palavras “gay”, “bisexual” ou “transgénero” no título ([ref](https://archive.ph/Xmoxk)).\n\nEm 2019, a Google concordou em pagar perto de 1 Bilião de Euros às autoridades Francesas para resolver um caso de fraude fiscal que começou 4 anos atrás ([ref](https://archive.ph/fGwEF)).\n\nEm 2020, um grupo de YouTubers processou a **YouTube** e a sua empresa mãe, **Google**, reivindicando que utiliza ferramentas automáticas para \"restringir, censurar e denegrir\" com base na **raça** ([ref](https://archive.ph/vzRCx)).\n\n## **Web 3.0**\n\nDo Airbnb ao YouTube, todos os dias usamos plataformas digitais privadas e tipicamente centralizadas, i.e controladas por uma única entidade (e.g, empresa global), o que apresenta sérios problemas relacionados com a sua infraestrutura, gestão, e economia. Recentemente, uma nova geração de tecnologias descentralizadas (Web 3.0) emergiu com o potencial de ultrapassar estes problemas estruturais.\n\nA **descentralização** significa que o controle de uma rede informática (conceção, hospedagem, manutenção) é dividido entre múltiplas pessoas e organizações. Não há nenhum grupo com controle pleno e é necessário um alargado consenso para que se possa efectuar alguma alteração na rede. A **PayPal é um bom exemplo de uma rede que não é descentralizada**. A empresa PayPal tem controlo completo sobre tudo o que se passa na sua rede – eles podem congelar contas, impedir os utilizadores de aceder ao seu dinheiro, ou mesmo reverter transações.\n\nGraças à democratização da potência de computação e armazenamento descentralizados, os utilizadores podem hoje aceder a uma internet mais fiável e justa, construida para as massas.\n\n> *Melhor tecnologia, experiência de utilização, e **educação** dos utilizadores são chave para a próxima alteração de paradigma*\n\nA tecnologia *blockchain* (ver introdução em \"Conceitos chave sobre redes descentralizadas e a tecnologia *blockchain*\") tem permitido **(i)** novos instrumentos financeiros — [criptomoedas](https://www.coingecko.com/pt) (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, etc – mais de 13000 moedas já foram criadas até ao momento), **(ii)** a criação de contratos inteligentes, e **(iii)** o desenvolvimento de *frameworks* para programação de aplicações descentralizadas (**dApps**). Os modelos propostos são tipicamente alinhados com os seguintes vectores:\n\n* Distribuição de recursos\n* (Micro-)Pagamento aos utilizadores por ações realizadas\n* Minimização do uso de dados privados\n\nEm 2015, Brewster Kahle, o fundador do [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), foi convocado para apresentar “uma internet inovadora” a cinco filantropos Americanos, e ele desafiou a comunidade tecnológica a construir uma nova e distribuida Web. Pouco tempo depois, pioneiros da Web Descentralizada (DWeb em Inglês) começaram a responder à chamada e em Junho de 2016 a Internet Archive acolheu o primeiro ***Decentralized Web Summit***.\n\n### Princípios da DWeb\n\nSe quiseres que o teu nome seja listado em [getdweb.net/principles](https://getdweb.net/principles/) como apoiante, clica dentro da página para preencheres o formulário requerido.\n\n**01.

O protocolo faz a correspondência entre pessoas com memória disponível em disco com aquelas que necessitam guardar algo na web de forma permanente. Tal é conseguido através de uma tecnologia **descentralizada** chamada **blockweave**.\n\nConstruída sobre este protocolo está a **permaweb**: Uma web de websites e aplicações que ‘vivem’ para sempre.\n\nA comunidade Arweave tem desenvolvido um kit completo de ferramentas e serviços que permitem a construção de aplicações 100% descentralizadas alojadas na permaweb.\n\n### IPFS\n\n[https://dweb.link/ipns/ipfs.io/](https://dweb.link/ipns/ipfs.io/)\n\n**Interplanetary File System** (IPFS) é um projecto [open-source](https://github.com/ipfs/) (de código aberto), um protocolo par-a-par de arquivo e sistema de ficheiros desenvolvido por [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/). Em ciência da computação, a informação partilhada entre máquinas através de uma rede é gerida por regras e convenções estabelecidas em **protocolos** de comunicação.

{"id": "e_IdrDOeBRhgnAgzjdanWrzdP2Jij6SlCl9W57SS9ec", "title": "Zero-Bound", "body": "## What Is Zero-Bound?\n\nZero-bound is an [expansionary monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expansionary_policy.asp) tool where a [central bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) lowers short-term interest rates to zero, if needed, to stimulate the economy. A central bank that is forced to enact this policy must also pursue other, often unconventional, methods of stimulus to resuscitate the economy.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Zero-bound is an expansionary monetary policy tool where a central bank lowers short-term interest rates to zero, if needed, to stimulate the economy.\n* Central banks will manipulate interest rates to either stimulate a stagnating economy or dampen an overheating one.\n* The Great Recession forced some international central banks to push the limits of zero-bound below the numerical level and implement negative rates to spur growth and spending.1\n\n## Understanding Zero-Bound\n\nZero-bound refers to the lowest level that [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) can fall to, and logic dictates that zero would be that level. The main arrow in a central bank's monetary policy quiver is interest rates. The bank will manipulate interest rates to either stimulate a stagnating economy or dampen an overheating one. Clearly, there are limits, especially at the lower end of the range.\n\nThe zero-bound is the lower limit that rates can be cut to, but no further. When this level is reached, and the economy is still underperforming, then the central bank can no longer provide [stimulus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-stimulus.asp) via interest rates. Economists use the term [liquidity trap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquiditytrap.asp) to describe this scenario.\n\nWhen faced with a liquidity trap, alternative procedures for monetary stimulus often become necessary. Conventional wisdom was that interest rates could not move into negative territory, meaning once interest rates reach zero or are close to zero, for example, 0.01%, [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) has to be altered to continue to stabilize or stimulate the economy.\n\nThe most familiar alternative monetary policy tool is perhaps [quantitative easing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp) (QE). This is where a central bank engages in a large-scale asset-buying program, often involving treasuries and other [government bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp). Not only will this keep short-term rates low, but it will push down longer-term rates, which further incentivizes borrowing.2\n\n### Negative Rates\n\nSince the [Great Recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp) of 2008 and 2009, some central banks pushed the limits of zero-bound below the numerical level and implemented [negative rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-interest-rate.asp).3 As the global economy plummeted, central banks slashed rates to spur growth and spending. However, as the recovery remained slow, central banks began entering the uncharted territory of negative rates. \n\nSweden was the first country to enter this territory, when in 2009 the Riksbank cut the [repo rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repurchaseagreement.asp) to 0.25%, which pushed the deposit rate to -0.25%.4 Since then, the [European Central Bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeancentralbank.asp) (ECB), the [Bank of Japan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankofjapan.asp) (BOJ), and a handful of others followed suit at one time or another. \n\nThere are instances where negative rates have been implemented during normal times. Switzerland is one such example; through much of the 2010s, its [target interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/target-rate.asp) was-0.75%, which was raised to -0.50% in 2021.5 Japan similarly had adopted a [negative interest rate policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-interest-rate-policy-nirp.asp) (NIRP), with a target rate of -0.1%.\n\n## Example of Zero-Bound and Negative Interest Rates in Switzerland\n\nThe [Swiss National Bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swiss-national-bank.asp) (SNB) maintains a negative interest-rate policy. While there are other examples of negative interest rates, the Swiss example is rather unique in that the country is opting to keep rates very low (and negative) to prevent its [currency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp) from rising too significantly.\n\nIn the Swiss example, negative interest rates are only applied to Swiss franc bank balances over a certain threshold.\n\nSwitzerland is viewed as a [safe-haven](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-haven.asp), with low political and [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) risk. Other examples of negative and zero-bound interest rate policies have often come about because of economic turmoil, which requires cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy.

{"id": "kn7QbSJwUYsJFrUNND9nJIp1AVxKlBVmlDrja_BLxwM", "title": "Zacks Investment Research", "body": "## What Is Zacks Investment Research?\n\n[Zacks Investment Research](https://www.zacks.com/) is an American company dedicated to the production of independent research and investment-related content. It was founded in 1978 by Len Zacks, based on his insights while pursuing his Ph.D. at MIT.\n\nThe company provides professional investors with financial data and analysis to help make better investment decisions for proprietary accounts and the investment accounts of clients. Zacks is probably known best known for its extensive array of consensus earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates. More recently, the company has moved into other related areas including [research reports](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/research-report.asp), recommendation summaries on various [stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp), stock prices, funds, charts and tables, and a host of other investment tools and data.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Zacks Investment Research is an American company that produces independent research and investment content.\n* Zacks was founded in 1978 by Len Zacks, a Ph.D. scholar from MIT.\n* Zacks Research is known for its focus on earnings estimate revisions, which Len Zacks described as \"the most powerful force impacting stock prices.\"\n* The company is known for \"Zacks Ranks,\" stock ratings on a scale of one to five. A rank of #1 means \"Strong Buy.\"\n* In addition to \"Zacks Ranks\" for stock prices, the company has also introduced ratings for mutual funds and ETFs. \n \n\n## Understanding Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks uses a quantitative stock-rating system that is purely mathematical, meaning they're not influenced by the biases or preferences of individual analysts. The rating system relies heavily on [Earnings per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS) related metrics, such as revisions to a company's projected earnings.\n\nThese ratings are based on research produced by U.S. brokerage firms. Every day, the company collects electronic data feeds and printed research on more than 8,500 North American publicly traded companies from 185 brokerage firms. By combining and aggregating the opinions of thousands of analysts, the company is able to identify expert consensus on the earnings potential of certain stocks.1\n\n## Zacks Ranks\n\nA key element of Zacks research products is Zacks Ranks, a set of investment ratings that groups equity products according to their earnings potential. Originally launched for stock rankings, Zacks Ranks is now available for mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and other vehicles.\n\nZacks Ranks assigns stocks into five categories ranging from \"Strong Buy\" to \"Strong Sell,\" based on the aggregate analysis of multiple brokerage assessments. According to the company, Zacks \"Strong Buy\" stocks have generated better than 25% annual average returns and outperformed the S&P 500 in 26 years out of 30.2\n\nZacks Ranks uses four criteria to assess earnings potential:\n\n* **Agreement**: the extent to which brokerage analysts are unanimous in assessing the change in a stock's valuation.\n* **Magnitude**: the size of the latest change in analysts' consensus.\n* **Upside**: the difference between the estimated change, as calculated by Zacks, compared with the consensus estimate.\n* **Surprise**: the occurrence of positive [earnings surprises](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningssurprise.asp#:\\~:text=A%20surprise%20occurs%20when%20a,a%20gradual%20increase%20over%20time.) in the last few quarters.3\n\nThese rankings are based on Len Zacks' insight that \"earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices.\" When a stocks' earnings estimates are revised upwards, institutional buyers will typically enlarge their positions, thereby buoying the prices of that security. Since large buyers take a long time to enlarge their positions, a small individual investor can quickly take advantage of the anticipated price bump.4\n\nZacks Ranks is a system that rates stocks between one to five. Unlike most ratings systems, a #1 Zacks Rank means \"Strong Buy.\"\n\n## Zacks vs. Morningstar\n\nZacks Investment Research is frequently compared with [Morningstar Inc](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/morningstarinc.asp)., a Chicago-based investment research firm that compiles data on mutual funds and ETFs. Like Zacks, Morningstar publishes analysis and rates funds on a five-tiered scale.\n\nHowever, the two companies take [different approaches](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/041916/zacks-vs-morningstar-comparing-mf-research-providers.asp) to investment research. While Zacks relies on quantitative analysis of fund performance, Morningstar has a larger focus on fundamental analysis. Morningstar also uses a proprietary mathematical formula, based on past performance, to determine how each fund ranks in its respective category. Both companies offer free and paid products, with different levels of access at each tier.\n\n## Example of Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks lists several cases of successful predictions to demonstrate the success of their investment model. One example is LSB Industries (LSX), which was given a \"Strong Buy\" in July of 2012 in anticipation of a potential breakout over the next three months.\n\nThe \"Strong Buy\" rating indicated that brokerage analysts had revised their earnings estimates for LSX, and were likely to continue revising their projections upwards. Within three months, following several more upward revisions, LSX had returned 36% gains to investors who used Zacks Research, compared to 5% returns by the S&P 500.5 \n \n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nZacks Investment Research is one of many firms that publish data and analysis of mutual funds, stocks, and other investment vehicles. However, Zacks stands out for its unique quantitative approach, focusing on revised earnings estimates as the key to identifying strong performers. Because brokerage analysts tend to be extremely conservative when it comes to revising their estimates, these revisions can be indicators of strong future performance.\n\n## What Is Zacks Stock Screener?\n\nThe Stock Screener is a paid product by Zacks Investment Research that allows an investor to sort and search for stocks according to desirable metrics, such as price changes, dividends, or return on investment. In keeping with their focus on earnings estimates, the Zacks Stock Screener also allows investors to sort stocks according to their Zacks Rank and changes to their earnings per share.6\n\n## How Much Does Zacks Stock Screener Cost?\n\nZacks Premium Screens are available with a premium membership, priced at $249 per year. This product is also available for higher tiers, with prices ranging as high as $2995 per year.7\n\n## What Is the Zacks Industry Rank?\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is the average Zacks Rank of all the companies in a specific industry sector. This metric can be used to identify favorable industry-wide conditions that could benefit similar companies.8\n\n## What Is the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank?\n\nThe Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is a rating that is applied to mutual funds, in the same way that Zacks Ranks are assigned to individual stocks. Each quarter, the Zacks Quantitative Research Department calculates a rating for 19,000 different mutual funds, based on the average Zacks Rank of the stocks held by each fund, as well as other quantitative factors.9 \n \n\n## What Is the Zacks ETF Rank?\n\nZacks ETF Rank is a similar ranking system that seeks to identify exchange-traded funds that have a favorable one-year outlook. These rankings are based on a wide range of quantitative metrics, such as expense ratio, momentum, yields, and the assets contained in each ETF.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654658916, "digest": "w3tcHP5ZGkUFUKAh9hEXr9hQydZPGXuvHPUnntC_qy0", "contributor": "0x5cD221E404Da08eA9d50CEEfD7F22EBa2549a2C4"}
{"id": "qj-_Dq_YnQhGkgdrOQVzN1SKAH8tVU__4LAtsngvE-0", "title": "Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)", "body": "What Is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)?\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), also known as the Dow 30, is a stock market index that tracks 30 large, publicly-owned blue-chip companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. The Dow Jones is named after Charles Dow, who created the index in 1896 along with his business partner Edward Jones.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a widely-watched benchmark index in the U.S. for blue-chip stocks.\nThe DJIA is a price-weighted index that tracks 30 large, publicly-owned companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.\nThe index was created by Charles Dow in 1896 to serve as a proxy for the broader U.S. economy.\n1:36\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average\nUnderstanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average\nThe DJIA is the second-oldest U.S. market index; the first was the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA).1 The DJIA was designed to serve as a proxy for the health of the broader U.S. economy. Often referred to simply as \"the Dow,\" the DJIA is one of the most-watched stock market indexes in the world. While the Dow includes a range of companies, all can be described as blue-chip companies with consistently stable earnings.\n\nWhen the index initially launched in 1896, it included only 12 companies. Those companies were primarily in the industrial sector, including railroads, cotton, gas, sugar, tobacco, and oil.2\n\nIn the early 20th century, the performance of industrial companies was typically tied to the overall growth rate in the economy. That cemented the relationship between the Dow's performance and the overall economy. Even today, for many investors, a strong-performing Dow equals a strong economy (while a weak-performing Dow indicates a slowing economy).\n\nAs the economy changes over time, so does the composition of the index. A component of the Dow may be dropped when a company becomes less relevant to current trends of the economy, to be replaced by a new name that better reflects the shift.\n\nA company that loses a large percentage of its market capitalization due to financial distress might be removed from the Dow. Market capitalization is a method of measuring the value of a company by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by its stock price.\n\nStocks with higher share prices are given greater weight in the index. So a higher percentage move in a higher-priced component will have a greater impact on the final calculated value. At the Dow's inception, Charles Dow calculated the average by adding the prices of the twelve Dow component stocks and dividing by twelve. The result was a simple average. Over time, there have been additions and subtractions to the index, such as mergers and stock splits that had to be accounted for. At that point, a simple mean calculation no longer made sense.\n\nThe Dow Divisor and Index Calculation\nThe Dow Divisor was created to address the simple average issue. The divisor is a predetermined constant that is used to determine the effect of a one-point move in any of the approximately 30 stocks that comprise the Dow. There have been instances when the divisor needed to be changed so that the value of the Dow stayed consistent. The Dow Divisor as of April 20, 2022, was 0.15172752595384.3\n\nThe Dow is not calculated using a weighted arithmetic average and it does not represent its component companies' market capitalization (unlike the S&P 500). Rather, it reflects the sum of the price of one share of stock for all the components, divided by the divisor. Thus, a one-point move in any of the component stocks will move the index by an identical number of points.\n\nDJIA Price = SUM (Component stock prices) / Dow Divisor\nDow Index Components\nThe Dow is often re-evaluated to replace companies that no longer meet the listing criteria with those that do. By 1928, the index had grown to 30 components. Its composition has changed many times since then.2\n\nThe first change came just three months after the 30-component index was launched. In its first few years until roughly the Great Depression, there were numerous changes to its components. The first large-scale change was in 1932 when eight stocks in the Dow were replaced.4\n\nThe most recent large-scale change to the composition of the Dow before 2020 took place in 1997. At this time, four of the index's components were replaced: Travelers' Group replaced Westinghouse Electric; Johnson & Johnson replaced Bethlehem Steel; Hewlett-Packard took over Texaco's spot, and Wal-Mart replaced Woolworth's.5\n\nTwo years later, in 1999, four more components of the Dow were changed, when Chevron, Sears Roebuck, Union Carbide, and Goodyear Tire were dropped while Home Depot, Intel, Microsoft, and SBC Communications were added.5\n\nOn June 26, 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. replaced General Electric Company.6 In addition, United Technologies merged with Raytheon Company and the new corporation entered the index as Raytheon Technologies, while DowDuPont spun off DuPont and was replaced by Dow Chemical Company in 2020 and 2019, respectively.78\n\nOn Aug. 24, 2020, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added to the Dow, replacing ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies.9\n\nThe table below alphabetically lists the companies included in the DJIA as of April 2022.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average Components\nCompany\tSymbol\tYear Added\n3M\tMMM\t1976\nAmerican Express\tAXP\t1982\nAmgen\tAMGN\t2020\nApple Inc.\tAAPL\t2015\nBoeing\tBA\t1987\nCaterpillar\tCAT\t1991\nChevron\tCVX\t2008\nCisco Systems\tCSCO\t2009\nThe Coca-Cola Company\tKO\t1987\nDow Inc.\tDOW\t2019\nGoldman Sachs\tGS\t2013\nThe Home Depot\tHD\t1999\nHoneywell\tHON\t2020\nIBM\tIBM\t1979\nIntel\tINTC\t1999\nJohnson & Johnson\tJNJ\t1997\nJPMorgan Chase\tJPM\t1991\nMcDonald's\tMCD\t1985\nMerck & Co.\tMRK\t1979\nMicrosoft\tMSFT\t1999\nNIKE\tNKE\t2013\nProctor & Gamble\tPG\t1932\nSalesforce\tCRM\t2020\nThe Travelers Companies\tTRV\t2009\nUnitedHealth Group\tUNH\t2012\nVerizon\tVZ\t2004\nVisa\tV\t2013\nWalmart\tWMT\t1997\nWalgreens Boots Alliance\tWBA\t2018\nThe Walt Disney Company\tDIS\t1991\n30 DJIA companies as of April 2022\nHistorical Milestones\nThe following are some important historical milestones achieved by the Dow:\n\nMarch 15, 1933: The largest one-day percentage gain in the index happened during the 1930s bear market, totaling 15.34%. The Dow gained 8.26 points and closed at 62.10.10\nOct. 19, 1987: The largest one-day percentage drop took place on Black Monday. The index fell 22.61%. There was no evident explanation for the crash, although program trading may have been a contributing factor.11\nSept. 17, 2001: The fourth-largest one-day point drop—and the largest at the time—took place on the first day of trading following the 9/11 attacks in New York City. The Dow dropped 684.81 points or about 7.1%.12 However, it is important to note that the index had been dropping before Sept. 11, losing more than 1,000 points between Jan. 2 and Sept. 10. The DJIA started to make traction after the attacks and regained all of what it lost, closing above 10,000 for the year.\nMay 3, 2013: The Dow surpassed the 15,000 mark for the first time in history.13\nJan. 25, 2017: The Dow closed above 20,000 points for the first time.14\nJan. 4, 2018: The index closed at 25,075.13, the first close above 25,000 points.15\nJan. 17, 2018: The Dow closed at 26,115.65, the first close above 26,000 points.16\nFeb. 5, 2018: The Dow fell a record 1,175.21 points.17\nDec. 26, 2018: The Dow recorded its largest one-day point gain of 1,086.25.18\nJuly 11, 2019: The Dow broke above 27,000 for the first time in its history.19\nFeb. 12, 2020: The Dow hits its pre-pandemic high of 29,551.20\nMarch 2020: The Dow Jones crashes with the back-to-back record down days amid the global coronavirus pandemic, breaking below 20,000 and falling 3,000 points in a single day amid several 2,000 and 1,500 up and down moves. It officially entered bear market territory on March 11, 2020, ending the longest bull market in history that began in March 2009.21\nNov. 16, 2020: The Dow finally breaks its pre-COVID-19 high, reaching 29,950.44 points.22\nNov. 24, 2020: The Dow breaks the 30,000 level for the first time, closing at 30,045.84.23\nJuly 2021: On July 12, 2021, the Dow trades above 35,000 for the first time. On July 23, 2021, it closes above 35,000 for the first time.24\nIndividuals can invest in the Dow, which would mean gaining exposure to all of the companies listed in it, through exchange traded funds (ETFs), such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA).\nLimitations of the DJIA\nMany critics of the Dow argue that it does not significantly represent the state of the U.S. economy as it consists of only 30 large-cap U.S. companies. They believe the number of companies is too small and it neglects companies of different sizes. Many critics believe the S&P 500 is a better representation of the economy as it includes significantly more companies, 500 versus 30.\n\nThe S&P 500 has outperformed the DIJA on an annualized basis over the last one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods.2526\nFurthermore, critics believe that factoring only the price of a stock in the calculation does not accurately reflect a company, as much as considering a company's market cap would. In this manner, a company with a higher stock price but a smaller market cap would have more weight than a company with a smaller stock price but a larger market cap, which would poorly reflect the true size of a company.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

This allows an investor to determine what financial activities are contributing the most to the changes in ROE. An investor can use analysis like this to compare the [operational efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operationalefficiency.asp) of two similar firms. Managers can use DuPont analysis to identify strengths or weaknesses that should be addressed.1\n\nThere are three major financial metrics that drive return on equity (ROE): [operating efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operationalefficiency.asp), asset use efficiency, and financial leverage. Operating efficiency is represented by [net profit margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net_margin.asp) or net income divided by total sales or revenue. Asset use efficiency is measured by the [asset turnover ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetturnover.asp). [Leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) is measured by the equity multiplier, which is equal to average assets divided by average equity.\n\n## DuPont Analysis Components\n\nDuPont analysis breaks ROE into its constituent components to determine which of these factors are most responsible for changes in ROE.\n\n### Net Profit Margin\n\nThe net profit margin is the ratio of bottom line profits compared to total revenue or total sales. This is one of the most basic measures of profitability.\n\nOne way to think about the net margin is to imagine a store that sells a single product for $1.00. After the costs associated with buying inventory, maintaining a location, paying employees, taxes, interest, and other expenses, the store owner keeps $0.15 in profit from each unit sold. That means the owner's profit margin is 15%, which can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Profit Margin} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Net Income} }{ \\\\text{Revenue} } = \\\\frac{ \\\\$0.15 }{ \\\\$1.00 } = 15\\\\% \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Profit Margin=RevenueNet Income​=$1.00$0.15​=15%​﻿\n\nThe profit margin can be improved if costs for the owner were reduced or if prices were raised, which can have a large impact on ROE. This is one of the reasons that a company's stock will experience high levels of [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) when management makes a change to its [guidance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guidance.asp) for future margins, costs, and prices.\n\n### Asset Turnover Ratio\n\nThe asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) to generate revenue. Imagine a company had $100 of assets, and it made $1,000 of total revenue last year. The assets generated 10 times their value in total revenue, which is the same as the asset turnover ratio and can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Revenue} }{ \\\\text{Average Assets} } = \\\\frac{ \\\\$1,000 }{ \\\\$100 } = 10 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Asset Turnover Ratio=Average AssetsRevenue​=$100$1,000​=10​\n\nA normal asset turnover ratio will vary from one industry group to another. For example, a discount retailer or grocery store will generate a lot of revenue from its assets with a small margin, which will make the asset turnover ratio very large. On the other hand, a utility company owns very expensive [fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp) relative to its revenue, which will result in an asset turnover ratio that is much lower than that of a retail firm.2\n\nThe ratio can be helpful when comparing two companies that are very similar. Because average assets include components like [inventory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp), changes in this ratio can signal that sales are slowing down or speeding up earlier than it would show up in other financial measures. If a company's asset turnover rises, its ROE will improve.\n\n### Financial Leverage\n\nFinancial leverage, or the equity multiplier, is an indirect analysis of a company's use of debt to finance its assets. Assume a company has $1,000 of assets and $250 of owner's equity. The [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) equation will tell you that the company also has $750 in debt (assets - liabilities = equity). If the company borrows more to purchase assets, the ratio will continue to rise. The accounts used to calculate financial leverage are both on the balance sheet, so analysts will divide average assets by average equity rather than the balance at the end of the period, as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Financial Leverage} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Average Assets} }{ \\\\text{Average Equity} } = \\\\frac{ \\\\$1,000 }{ \\\\$250 } = 4 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​Financial Leverage=Average EquityAverage Assets​=$250$1,000​=4​﻿\n\nMost companies should use debt with equity to fund operations and growth. Not using any leverage could put the company at a disadvantage compared with its peers. However, using too much [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp) in order to increase the financial leverage ratio—and therefore increase ROE—can create disproportionate risks.\n\n## Example of DuPont Analysis Use\n\nAn investor has been watching two similar companies, SuperCo and Gear Inc., that have recently been improving their return on equity compared to the rest of their [peer group](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-group.asp). This could be a good thing if the two companies are making better use of assets or improving profit margins.\n\nIn order to decide which company is a better opportunity, the investor decides to use DuPont analysis to determine what each company is doing to improve its ROE and whether that improvement is sustainable.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020\n\nAs you can see in the table, SuperCo improved its profit margins by increasing net income and reducing its total assets. SuperCo's changes improved its profit margin and asset turnover. The investor can deduce from the information that SuperCo also reduced some of its debt since average equity remained the same.\n\nLooking closely at Gear Inc., the investor can see that the entire change in ROE was due to an increase in financial leverage. This means Gear Inc. borrowed more money, which reduced average equity. The investor is concerned because the additional borrowings didn't change the company's net income, revenue, or profit margin, which means the leverage may not be adding any real value to the firm.\n\nOr, as a real-life example, consider Walmart Stores (NYSE: [WMT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=wmt)). Walmart has a net income over the [trailing twelve months](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) of $4.75 billion, revenue of $559.2 billion, assets of $252.5 billion, and shareholders' equity of $80.9 billion.3\n\nThe company's profit margin is 0.8%, or $4.75 billion / $559.2 billion. Its asset turnover is 2.22, or $559.2 billion / $252.5 billion. The financial leverage (or equity multiplier) is 3.12, or $252.5 billion / $80.9 billion. Thus, its return or equity (ROE) is 5.5%, or 0.8% x 2.22 x 3.12.\n\n## DuPont Analysis vs. ROE\n\nThe return on equity (ROE) metric is net income divided by shareholders’ equity. The Dupont analysis is still the ROE, just an expanded version. The ROE calculation alone reveals how well a company utilizes capital from shareholders.\n\nWith a Dupont analysis, investors and analysts can dig into what drives changes in ROE, or why an ROE is considered high or low. That is, a Dupont analysis can help deduce whether its profitability, use of assets, or debt that’s driving ROE.\n\n## Limitations of Using DuPont Analysis\n\nThe biggest drawback of the DuPont analysis is that, while expansive, it still relies on accounting equations and data that can be manipulated. Plus, even with its comprehensiveness, the Dupont analysis lacks context as to why the individual ratios are high or low, or even whether they should be considered high or low at all.4\n\n## What Does DuPont Analysis Tell You?\n\nDuPont analysis is a useful technique used to decompose the different drivers of return on equity (ROE) for a business. This allows an investor to determine what financial activities are contributing the most to the changes in ROE. An investor can use analysis like this to compare the operational efficiency of two similar firms.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between 3-Step and 5-Step DuPont Analysis?\n\nThere are two versions of DuPont analysis, one utilizing decomposition of ROE via 3 steps and another utilizing 5 steps. The three-step equation breaks up ROE into three very important components:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{ROE} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Net Income} }{ \\\\text{Sales} } \\\\times \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Sales} }{ \\\\text{Assets} } \\\\times \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Assets} }{ \\\\text{Shareholders' Equity} } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​ROE=SalesNet Income​×AssetsSales​×Shareholders’ EquityAssets​​\n\nThe five-step version instead is:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{ROE} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{EBT} }{ \\\\text{S} } \\\\times \\\\frac{ \\\\text{S} }{ \\\\text{A} } \\\\times \\\\frac{ \\\\text{A} }{ \\\\text{E} } \\\\times ( 1 - \\\\text{TR} ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EBT} = \\\\text{Earnings before tax} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{S} = \\\\text{Sales} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{A} = \\\\text{Assets} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{E} = \\\\text{Equity} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{TR} = \\\\text{Tax rate} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}​ROE=SEBT​×AS​×EA​×(1−TR)where:EBT=Earnings before taxS=SalesA=AssetsE=EquityTR=Tax rate​\n\n## Why Is It Called DuPont Analysis?\n\nIn the 1920s, the American chemicals and manufacturing giant, DuPont Corporation, created an internal management tool to better understand where its operating efficiency was coming from and where it was falling short. By breaking down ROE into a more complex equation, DuPont analysis shows the causes of shifts in this number.5\n\n## What Are Some Limitations of Using DuPont analysis?\n\nWhile DuPont analysis can be a very helpful tool for managers, analysts, and investors, it is not without its weaknesses. The expansive nature of the DuPont equations means that it requires several inputs. As with any calculation, the results are only as good as the accuracy of the inputs. DuPont analysis utilizes data from a company's income statement and balance sheet, some of which may not be entirely accurate. Even if the data used for calculations are reliable, there are still additional potential problems, such as the difficulty of determining the [relative values](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relative-value.asp) of ratios as good or bad compared to industry norms. Seasonal factors, depending on the industry, can also be an important consideration, since these factors can distort ratios. Some companies always carry a higher level of inventory at certain times of the year, for example. Different [accounting practices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-practice.asp) between companies can also make accurate comparisons difficult.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsv8Weml7jLBnUh19Mm8msbd4As7-4LQjVoDO46aaB_49Y9YF1ktlrDAGtY_fNEojAHefOaP4M69rbXh-kvrPPuLF_ffZ7YsXbdgZ0eIxk9o1i3Wjeea0lPDu0GD_bzHbSbd4QiKhDsiseCy9T3H-rwoAataTHJkxpVw3OSo_PXsM_nvuYDx72DvE_HM0zch8wZA7GAlhCqhLGWwf1RELgZsvEnwSuwwG-BIbEEY9M0-aP2DdrbOaHlTooFIeH7tcpkwAaWa7PTy069mthDDKkRodM6yXgvi-IJ3KumdpgI_OkmK3D27QqJ1QqzyBJQFNQweVuBunycZs4NTz2Z5tfVKjFoV_Mp1Iyrkrhoy_gvYgXk&sig=Cg0ArKJSzP-YO8zgDB86EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsv8Weml7jLBnUh19Mm8msbd4As7-4LQjVoDO46aaB_49Y9YF1ktlrDAGtY_fNEojAHefOaP4M69rbXh-kvrPPuLF_ffZ7YsXbdgZ0eIxk9o1i3Wjeea0lPDu0GD_bzHbSbd4QiKhDsiseCy9T3H-rwoAataTHJkxpVw3OSo_PXsM_nvuYDx72DvE_HM0zch8wZA7GAlhCqhLGWwf1RELgZsvEnwSuwwG-BIbEEY9M0-aP2DdrbOaHlTooFIeH7tcpkwAaWa7PTy069mthDDKkRodM6yXgvi-IJ3KumdpgI_OkmK3D27QqJ1QqzyBJQFNQweVuBunycZs4NTz2Z5tfVKjFoV_Mp1Iyrkrhoy_gvYgXk&sig=Cg0ArKJSzP-YO8zgDB86EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

Because they offer the entire payment at maturity, zero-coupon bonds tend to fluctuate in price, much more so than [coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/couponbond.asp).1\n\nA bond is a portal through which a corporate or governmental body raises capital. When bonds are issued, investors purchase those bonds, effectively acting as lenders to the issuing entity. The investors earn a return in the form of [coupon payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp), which are made semiannually or annually, throughout the life of the bond.\n\nWhen the [bond matures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), the bondholder is repaid an amount equal to the [face value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp) of the bond. The par or face value of a corporate bond is typically stated as $1,000. If a corporate bond is issued at a discount, this means investors can purchase the bond below its par value. For example, an investor who purchases a bond for $920 at a discount will receive $1,000. The $80 return, plus coupon payments received on the bond, is the investor's earnings or return for holding the bond.\n\nBut not all bonds have coupon payments. Those that do not are referred to as zero-coupon bonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount and repay the par value, at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value represents the investor's return. The payment received by the investor is equal to the principal invested plus the interest earned, compounded semiannually, at a stated yield.\n\nThe interest earned on a zero-coupon bond is an [imputed interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imputedinterest.asp), meaning that it is an estimated interest rate for the bond and not an established interest rate. For example, a bond with a face amount of $20,000, that matures in 20 years, with a 5.5% yield, may be purchased for roughly $6,855. At the end of the 20 years, the investor will receive $20,000. The difference between $20,000 and $6,855 (or $13,145) represents the [interest that compounds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp) automatically until the bond matures. Imputed interest is sometimes referred to as \"phantom interest.\"\n\nThe imputed interest on the bond is subject to [income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp), according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Therefore, although no coupon payments are made on zero-coupon bonds until maturity, investors may still have to pay federal, state, and local income taxes on the imputed interest that accrues each year. Purchasing a municipal zero-coupon bond, buying zero-coupon bonds in a tax-exempt account, or purchasing a corporate zero-coupon bond that has tax-exempt status are a few ways to avoid paying income taxes on these securities.1\n\n## Pricing a Zero-Coupon Bond\n\nThe price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated as:\n\nPrice = M ÷ (1 + r)n\n\nwhere:\n\n* M = Maturity value or face value of the bond\n* r = required rate of interest\n* n = number of years until maturity\n\nIf an investor wishes to make a 6% return on a bond, with $25,000 par value, that is due to mature in three years, they will be willing to pay the following:\n\n> *$25,000 / (1 + 0.06)3 = $20,991.*\n\nIf the debtor accepts this offer, the bond will be sold to the investor at $20,991 / $25,000 = 84% of the face value. Upon maturity, the investor gains $25,000 - $20,991 = $4,009, which translates to 6% interest per year.\n\nThe greater the length of time until the bond matures, the less the investor pays for it, and vice versa. The maturity dates on zero-coupon bonds are usually long-term, with initial maturities of at least 10 years. These long-term maturity dates let investors plan for long-range goals, such as saving for a child’s college education. With the bond's deep discount, an investor can put up a small amount of money that can grow over time.\n\nZero-coupon bonds can be issued from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Treasury, state and local government entities, and corporations. Most zero-coupon bonds trade on the major exchanges.1\n\nZero-coupon bonds are like other bonds, in that they do carry various types of risk, because they are subject to interest rate risk if investors sell them before maturity.\n\n## How Does a Zero-Coupon Bond Differ From a Regular Bond?\n\nPayment of interest, or coupons, is the [key differentiator](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/zerocouponregularbond.asp) between a zero-coupon and regular bond. Regular bonds, which are also called coupon bonds, pay interest over the life of the bond and also repay the principal at maturity. A zero-coupon bond does not pay interest but instead trades at a deep discount, giving the investor a profit at maturity when they redeem the bond for its full face value.\n\n## How Does an Investor Price a Zero-Coupon Bond?\n\nAn investor chooses the zero-coupon bond they would like to purchase based on several criteria, but one of the main ones will be the imputed interest rate that they can earn at maturity. The price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated with the following equation:\n\nZero-coupon bond price = Maturity value ÷ (1 + required interest rate)^number years to maturity\n\n## How Does the IRS Tax Zero-Coupon Bonds?\n\nImputed interest, sometimes referred to as \"phantom interest,\" is an estimated interest rate. The imputed interest on the bond is subject to income tax. The IRS uses an accretive method when calculating the imputed interest on Treasury bonds and has applicable federal rates that set a minimum interest rate in relation to imputed interest and original issue discount rules.", "timestamp": 1654659242, "digest": "MZ9NK4IGc9MYE3t7PcLzKMA2GPAcy83jysOO_pJ99yE", "contributor": "0x959D92bCD3CADEc9eb35a8F6eB07578537fB9c50"}

That is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ([EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp)).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* EBITA removes from the earnings equation the taxes owed, the interest on company debt, and the effects of amortization, which is the accounting practice of writing off the cost of an intangible asset over a period of years\n* This measure can provide a more accurate view of a company's real performance over time.\n* EBITA may also allow for easier comparison of one company to another in the same industry.\n\n## Understanding EBITA\n\nA company's EBITA is considered by some analysts and investors to be a more accurate representation of its real earnings. It removes from the equation the taxes owed, the interest on company debt, and the effects of amortization, which is the accounting practice of writing off the cost of an intangible asset over a period of years.1\n\nOne benefit is that it more clearly indicates how much cash flow a company has on hand to reinvest in the business or pay dividends. It also is seen as an indicator of the efficiency of a company's operations. \n \n\n## EBITA vs. EBITDA\n\nEBITA is not used as commonly as EBITDA, which adds [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) into the calculation. Depreciation, in company accounting, is the recording of the reduced value of the company's tangible assets over time. It's a way of accounting for the wear and tear on assets such as equipment and facilities. Some companies, such as those in the utilities, manufacturing, and telecommunications industries, require significant expenditures in equipment and infrastructure, which are reflected in their books.\n\nBoth EBITA and EBITDA are useful tools in gauging a company's operating profitability. Profitability is earnings generated throughout the ordinary course of doing business. A clearer picture of the company's profitability may be gained if capital expenditures and financing costs are subtracted from the official earnings total.\n\nAnalysts generally consider both EBITA and EBITDA to be reliable indicators of a company’s [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp). However, some industries require significant investment in fixed assets. Using EBITA to evaluate companies in those industries may distort a company's profitability by ignoring the depreciation of those assets. EBITDA is deemed to be a more appropriate measure of its operating profitability.\n\nIn other words, the EBITA measurement may be used instead of EBITDA for companies that do not have substantial [capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) that may skew the numbers.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 15 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:14\n\n#### Earnings\n\n## EBITA and GAAP Earnings vs. Non-GAAP Earnings\n\n[GAAP earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-analysis/062716/gaap-vs-nongaap-which-should-you-consider-evaluation.asp)—those based on \"generally accepted accounting principles\"—are, as their name suggests, a common set of standards that are accepted and used by companies and their accounting departments. The use of GAAP earnings standardizes the financial reporting of publicly traded companies.\n\nMany companies report GAAP earnings as well as [non-GAAP earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-gaap-earnings.asp), which exclude \"one-time\" transactions. The rationale for reporting non-GAAP earnings is that substantial one-off costs such as organizational restructuring can distort the true picture of a company's financial performance and should therefore not be thought of as normal operational costs. EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBITA, and EBITDA are examples of commonly used non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nInvestors need to be careful to take GAAP earnings into consideration when making investment decisions. Standardized accounting rules allow for the comparison of financial results between competitive companies. The [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) has been putting pressure on companies to be more transparent about their GAAP versus non-GAAP earnings. One issue of SEC concern is that economic conditions related to the coronavirus pandemic have forced companies to account for unusual gains, charges, and losses that have complicated their financial reporting.23\n\n## Calculation of EBITA\n\nTo calculate a company's EBITA, an analyst must first determine the company’s [earnings before tax (EBT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebt.asp). This figure appears in the company's income statements and other investor relations materials. Add to this figure any interest and amortization costs. So the formula is:\n\n**EBITA = EBT + interest expense + amortization expense**\n\n## What's the Difference Between EBITA and EBITDA?\n\nEach of these is a measure of profitability used by investors: earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Both are useful in gauging a company's profitability. EBITDA is the more commonly used measure of the two.\n\n## Where Can You Find a Company's EBITA?\n\nIf a company doesn't provide this metric (there's no legal requirement to do so), you find it by looking at the firm's financial statements. Look for the earnings, tax, and interest figures on the income statement; the amortization is normally found in the notes to operating profit or on the cash flow statement. A shortcut to calculating EBITA is to start with operating profit, also called [earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp), then add back amortization.\n\n## How Is EBITA Useful?\n\nIt is thought to be a reliable indicator of how much cash flow a company has on hand to put back into the business or to pay dividends. It also can indicate how efficient a company's operations are.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjst5HjA8S2qe7oS_Aqy4I0IoWlJXGEf1GNPcT20VhtKIzrLtNCb5PAAA7H7guhzHv7gfWF76KtaV8G67lr3pHSvIWX2SsjnS8cDh_9i-ENLsAjSIRmP5K3iJ-f-cQ7HwqyfqhsmSovUSNFaIFBFxRr0ITQxmq7L_vltiLpfPo0OWWxRuNioeA90gvTFeXXpjZsnm4RJQw97015u3OqDYbJ0hi7-WCbZJLVF_vyOPV60Bvs6Rn0JLrexobhbsx9zG7U1IAM4RgA3f_P8hfVs1qBK5-foCIHH8F6Vp0FvjrOI1f5WmTo_skB9hh28cHnMb0kgmbGdeYWJmasOLDoeZw7zRNOXh9nxAf05zm5d45x4aGHw&sig=Cg0ArKJSzJgFbMg9Ll4TEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjst5HjA8S2qe7oS_Aqy4I0IoWlJXGEf1GNPcT20VhtKIzrLtNCb5PAAA7H7guhzHv7gfWF76KtaV8G67lr3pHSvIWX2SsjnS8cDh_9i-ENLsAjSIRmP5K3iJ-f-cQ7HwqyfqhsmSovUSNFaIFBFxRr0ITQxmq7L_vltiLpfPo0OWWxRuNioeA90gvTFeXXpjZsnm4RJQw97015u3OqDYbJ0hi7-WCbZJLVF_vyOPV60Bvs6Rn0JLrexobhbsx9zG7U1IAM4RgA3f_P8hfVs1qBK5-foCIHH8F6Vp0FvjrOI1f5WmTo_skB9hh28cHnMb0kgmbGdeYWJmasOLDoeZw7zRNOXh9nxAf05zm5d45x4aGHw&sig=Cg0ArKJSzJgFbMg9Ll4TEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

在 The OEC Dapps上面获得了第四名的成绩\n\n*OEC

{"id": "FZobwck6TVb7TFU4ReiSpJP7RnGPCN3koXLWCCkEFQ0", "title": "Zero-One Integer Programming", "body": "## What Is Zero-One Integer Programming?\n\nZero-one integer programming (which can also be written as '0-1' integer programming) is a mathematical method of using a series of binary functions; in particular, yes ('1') and no ('0') answers to arrive at a solution when there are two [mutually exclusive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutuallyexclusive.asp) options.\n\nIn the world of finance, zero-one integer programming is often used to provide answers to [capital rationing problems](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalrationing.asp), as well as to optimize investment returns and assist in planning, production, transportation, and other issues.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Zero-one integer programming relies on mutually exclusive yes (1) and no (0) decisions to find solutions to logic problems.\n* In zero-one integer problems, each variable is represented only by 0 ('no') or 1 ('yes'), and could represent selecting or rejecting an option, turning on or off electronic switches, or a straight-forward yes or no answer used in various other applications.\n* This type of programming can be useful for companies making decisions on issues like what to invest in or which of two proposed products are easiest to manufacture.\n\n## Understanding Zero-One Integer Programming\n\nInteger programming is a branch of mathematical programming or optimization, which involves creating equations in order to solve problems. The term \"mathematical programming\" is connected with the fact that the goal of solving various problems is choosing programs of action. Assigning a simple yes/no value can be a powerful way to establish a linear problem-solving framework to identify inefficiencies.\n\nFundamentally, the most basic instructions executed by a computer are binary codes, consisting only of ones and zeros. Those codes are directly translated into the “on” and “off” states of the electricity moving through the computer’s physical circuits. In essence, these simple codes form the basis of “machine language”, the most fundamental variety of programming languages. These on and off positions can also be construed as assigning a \"yes\" or \"no\" to a logical function.\n\nOf course, no human would be able to construct modern software programs by explicitly programming ones and zeros. Instead, human programmers must rely on various layers of abstraction that can allow them to articulate their commands in a format that is more intuitive to humans. Specifically, modern programmers issue commands in so-called “high-level languages”, which utilize intuitive syntax such as whole English words and sentences, as well as logical operators such as “And”, “Or”, and “Else” that are familiar to everyday usage.\n\nUltimately, however, these high-level commands need to be translated into machine language. Rather than doing so manually, programmers rely on [assembly languages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assembly-language.asp) whose purpose is to automatically translate between these high-level and low-level languages.\n\n## Real-World Example of Zero-One Integer Programming\n\nA simple example of how zero-one integer [programming](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/application-programming-interface.asp) might be used in capital rationing would be in determining the number of product development projects that can be completed by a company by a certain date or within a certain budget. For example, a number of variables for each project can be given values that ultimately result in a 1 (yes) or 0 (no) binary decision about whether or not to include the project in a budget. This can be helpful to companies that are unsure about a specific business decision and are looking for a straightforward way to assess the possibilities.", "timestamp": 1654659393, "digest": "Gg3So5PamtDMethFnDdZ9eXvxZYIExhholxCItFK8uQ", "contributor": "0x2F6696DAf4CedB63620ca9fE244e70E770dDcc9f"}

{"id": "K68HUP5l0Z1BByLpXeMBSNWySz38Sz-KGID_gpzK0Ko", "title": "Earnings Per Share (EPS)", "body": "## What Is Earnings Per Share (EPS)?\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is calculated as a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. The resulting number serves as an indicator of a company's profitability. It is common for a company to report EPS that is adjusted for [extraordinary items](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extraordinaryitem.asp) and potential share dilution.\n\nThe higher a company's EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Earnings per share (EPS) is a company's net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding.1\n* EPS indicates how much money a company makes for each share of its stock and is a widely used metric for estimating corporate value.\n* A higher EPS indicates greater value because investors will pay more for a company's shares if they think the company has higher profits relative to its share price.1\n* EPS can be arrived at in several forms, such as excluding extraordinary items or discontinued operations, or on a diluted basis.\n* Like other financial metrics, earnings per share is most valuable when compared against competitor metrics, companies of the same industry, or across a period of time.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 10 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:10\n\n#### Earnings Per Share Explained\n\n## Formula and Calculation for EPS\n\nEarnings per share value is calculated as net income (also known as profits or earnings) divided by available shares. A more refined calculation adjusts the numerator and denominator for shares that could be created through options, convertible debt, or warrants. The numerator of the equation is also more relevant if it is adjusted for continuing operations.1\n\n> *\\\\text{Earnings per Share}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Net Income }-\\\\text{ Preferred Dividends}}{\\\\text{End-of-Period Common Shares Outstanding}}Earnings per Share=End-of-Period Common Shares OutstandingNet Income − Preferred Dividends​*\n\nTo calculate a company's EPS, the balance sheet and income statement are used to find the period-end number of common shares, dividends paid on preferred stock (if any), and the net income or earnings. It is more accurate to use a weighted average number of common shares over the reporting term because the number of shares can change over time.\n\nAny stock dividends or splits that occur must be reflected in the calculation of the weighted average number of [shares outstanding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp). Some data sources simplify the calculation by using the number of shares outstanding at the end of a period.\n\nEPS for FAANG Stocks\n\n## Example of EPS\n\nSay that the calculation of EPS for three companies at the end of the fiscal year was as follows:\n\nEPS Example**CompanyNet IncomePreferred DividendsWeighted Common SharesBasic EPS**Ford$7.6B$03.98B$7.6/3.98 = $1.91Bank of America$18.23B$1.61B10.2B$18.23-$1.61/10.2 = $1.63NVIDIA$1.67B$00.541B$1.67/0.541 = $3.09\n\n## How Is EPS Used?\n\nEarnings per share is one of the most important metrics employed when determining a firm's profitability on an absolute basis. It is also a major component of calculating the [price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp), where the E in P/E refers to EPS. By dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share, an investor can see the value of a stock in terms of how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.2\n\nEPS is one of the many indicators you could use to pick stocks. If you have an interest in stock trading or investing, your next step is to choose a [broker](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-brokers-4587872) that works for your investment style.\n\nComparing EPS in absolute terms may not have much meaning to investors because ordinary shareholders do not have direct access to the earnings. Instead, investors will compare EPS with the share price of the stock to determine the value of earnings and how investors feel about future growth.\n\n## Basic EPS vs. Diluted EPS\n\nThe [formula](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070114/what-formula-calculating-earnings-share-eps.asp) in the table above calculates the [basic EPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic-earnings-per-share.asp) of each of these select companies. Basic EPS does not factor in the dilutive effect of shares that could be issued by the company. When the capital structure of a company includes items such as stock options, warrants, or restricted stock units (RSU), these investments—if exercised—could increase the total number of shares outstanding in the market.\n\nTo better illustrate the effects of additional securities on per-share earnings, companies also report the [diluted EPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilutedeps.asp), which assumes that all shares that could be outstanding have been issued.\n\nFor example, the total number of shares that could be created and issued from NVIDIA's convertible instruments for the fiscal year that ended in 2017 was 23 million. If this number is added to its total shares outstanding, its diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 541 million + 23 million = 564 million shares. The company's diluted EPS is, therefore, $1.67 billion /.564 million = $2.96.3\n\nSometimes an adjustment to the numerator is required when calculating a fully diluted EPS. For example, sometimes a lender will provide a loan that allows them to convert the debt into shares under certain conditions. The shares that would be created by the convertible debt should be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation, but if that happened, then the company wouldn’t have paid interest on the debt. In this case, the company or analyst will add the interest paid on convertible debt back into the numerator of the EPS calculation so the result isn’t distorted.\n\n## EPS Excluding Extraordinary Items\n\nEarnings per share can be distorted, both intentionally and unintentionally, by several factors. Analysts use variations of the basic EPS formula to avoid the most common ways that EPS may be inflated.\n\nImagine a company that owns two factories that make cellphone screens. The land on which one of the factories sits has become very valuable as new developments have surrounded it over the past few years. The company’s management team decides to sell the factory and build another one on less valuable land. This transaction creates a windfall profit for the firm.\n\nThough this land sale has created real profits for the company and its shareholders, it is considered an “extraordinary item” because there is no reason to believe the company can repeat that transaction in the future. Shareholders might be misled if the windfall is included in the numerator of the EPS equation, so it is excluded.\n\nA similar argument could be made if a company had an [unusual loss](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unusual-item.asp)—maybe the factory burned down—which would have temporarily decreased EPS and should be excluded for the same reason. The calculation for EPS excluding extraordinary items is:\n\n> *\\\\text{EPS}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Net Income }-\\\\text{ Pref.Div. }\\\\left(+or-\\\\right)\\\\text{ Extraordinary Items}}{\\\\text{Weighted Average Common Shares}}EPS=Weighted Average Common SharesNet Income − Pref.Div. (+or−) Extraordinary Items​*\n\n## EPS From Continuing Operations\n\nA company started the year with 500 stores and had an EPS of $5.00. However, assume that this company closed 100 stores over that period and ended the year with 400 stores. An analyst will want to know what the EPS was for just the 400 stores the company plans to continue with into the next period.\n\nIn this example, that could increase the EPS because the 100 closed stores were perhaps operating at a loss. By evaluating EPS from continuing operations, an analyst is better able to compare prior performance to current performance\n\n## EPS and Capital\n\nAn important aspect of EPS that is often ignored is the capital that is required to generate the earnings (net income) in the calculation. Two companies could generate the same EPS, but one could do so with fewer net assets; that company would be more efficient at using its capital to generate income and, all other things being equal, would be a \"better\" company in terms of efficiency. A metric that can be used to identify more efficient companies is the [return on equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE).\n\n## EPS and Dividends\n\nAlthough EPS is widely used as a way to track a company’s performance, shareholders do not have direct access to those profits. A portion of the earnings may be distributed as a dividend, but all or a portion of the EPS can be retained by the company. Shareholders, through their representatives on the [board of directors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp), would have to change the portion of EPS that is distributed through dividends to access more of those profits.4\n\n## EPS and Price-to-Earnings (P/E)\n\nMaking a comparison of the P/E ratio within an industry group can be helpful, though in unexpected ways. Although it seems like a stock that costs more relative to its EPS when compared to peers might be “overvalued,” the opposite tends to be the rule. Regardless of its historical EPS, investors are willing to pay more for a stock if it is expected to grow or outperform its peers. In a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp), it is normal for the stocks with the highest P/E ratios in a stock index to outperform the average of the other stocks in the index.\n\n## What Is a Good EPS?\n\nWhat counts as a good EPS will depend on factors such as the recent performance of the company, the performance of its competitors, and the expectations of the analysts who follow the stock. Sometimes, a company might report growing EPS, but the stock might decline in price if analysts were expecting an even higher number.\n\nLikewise, a shrinking EPS figure might nonetheless lead to a price increase if analysts were expecting an even worse result. It is important to always judge EPS in relation to the company’s share price, such as by looking at the company’s P/E or [earnings yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsyield.asp).\n\n## What Is the Difference Between Basic EPS and Diluted EPS?\n\nAnalysts will sometimes distinguish between basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS consists of the company’s net income divided by its outstanding shares. It is the figure most commonly reported in the financial media and is also the simplest definition of EPS.\n\nDiluted EPS, on the other hand, will always be equal to or lower than basic EPS because it includes a more expansive definition of the company’s shares outstanding. Specifically, it incorporates shares that are not currently outstanding but could become outstanding if stock options and other convertible securities were to be exercised.1\n\n## What Is the Difference Between EPS and Adjusted EPS?\n\nAdjusted EPS is a type of EPS calculation in which the analyst makes adjustments to the numerator. Typically, this consists of adding or removing components of net income that are deemed to be non-recurring. For instance, if the company’s net income was increased based on a one-time sale of a building, the analyst might deduct the proceeds from that sale, thereby reducing net income. In that scenario, adjusted EPS would be lower than basic EPS.\n\n## What Are Some Limitations of EPS?\n\nWhen looking at EPS to make an investment or trading decision, be aware of some possible drawbacks. For instance, a company can game its EPS by buying back stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding, and inflating the EPS number given the same level of earnings. Changes to accounting policy for reporting earnings can also change EPS. EPS also does not take into account the price of the share, so it has little to say about whether a company's stock is over or undervalued.\n\n## How Do You Calculate EPS Using Excel?\n\nAfter collecting the necessary data, input the net income, preferred dividends, and number of common shares outstanding into three adjacent cells, say B3 through B5. In cell B6, input the formula \"=B3-B4\" to subtract preferred dividends from net income. In cell B7, input the formula \"=B6/B5\" to render the EPS ratio.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvXoa2v6SStekcCcfTIk_USSNix69fWzkpAh0ZS07OsOsirshvOenFqhyRcx7cStuqkpzplF9RMZ9vN1SIHTvQoROVEkBvti0kLh7F8jK8t4eD3tFgj2C3DS4VEumVnEnZFdCO-58c05JZVNBNp9YUT-hfo01mBODCR9pDIs17wHVA9c2JHPThoLICFbT1Ee3zsBTMFaQR3w_1wRLSVsA68QP6PCGNNAhOgE4ZU7QG5Dgau4d438DXBimdZcvMPmD3JuExCj5c1fQ0tYO_tNXjCXxXzg2mumawVrjFeCHNyqPKzp1Smv6c1o92ooXJVKWGaYUviHRICuAR9gJ4piqEEkavR8GY9kVPWfpz0CwjrOqc&sig=Cg0ArKJSzBrskCm2x4R6EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvXoa2v6SStekcCcfTIk_USSNix69fWzkpAh0ZS07OsOsirshvOenFqhyRcx7cStuqkpzplF9RMZ9vN1SIHTvQoROVEkBvti0kLh7F8jK8t4eD3tFgj2C3DS4VEumVnEnZFdCO-58c05JZVNBNp9YUT-hfo01mBODCR9pDIs17wHVA9c2JHPThoLICFbT1Ee3zsBTMFaQR3w_1wRLSVsA68QP6PCGNNAhOgE4ZU7QG5Dgau4d438DXBimdZcvMPmD3JuExCj5c1fQ0tYO_tNXjCXxXzg2mumawVrjFeCHNyqPKzp1Smv6c1o92ooXJVKWGaYUviHRICuAR9gJ4piqEEkavR8GY9kVPWfpz0CwjrOqc&sig=Cg0ArKJSzBrskCm2x4R6EAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

{"id": "rzDmWrPqnyQz0KKF-UjvGMwICMNpGSiGaDH_OU5EdKo", "title": "Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)", "body": "## What Is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)?\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an indicator of a company's profitability. EBIT can be calculated as [revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) minus expenses excluding tax and [interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp). EBIT is also referred to as operating earnings, operating profit, and profit before interest and taxes.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is a company's net income before income tax expense and interest expenses are deducted. \n* EBIT is used to analyze the performance of a company's core operations without the costs of the capital structure and tax expenses impacting profit. \n* EBIT is also known as operating income since they both exclude interest expenses and taxes from their calculations. However, there are cases when operating income can differ from EBIT.\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 3 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n2:03\n\n#### EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)\n\n## Formula and Calculation for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{EBIT}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Revenue}\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\text{COGS}\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\text{Operating Expenses}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Or}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EBIT}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Net Income}\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\text{Interest}\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\text{Taxes}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{COGS}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Cost of goods sold} \\\\end{aligned}​EBIT = Revenue − COGS − Operating ExpensesOrEBIT = Net Income + Interest + Taxeswhere:COGS = Cost of goods sold​﻿\n\nThe EBIT calculation takes a company's cost of manufacturing including [raw materials](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp) and total [operating expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp), which include employee wages. These items and then subtracted from revenue. The steps are outlined below:\n\n1. Take the value for revenue or sales from the top of the income statement.\n2. Subtract the [cost of goods sold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) from revenue or sales, which gives you [gross profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp).\n3. Subtract the [operating expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp) from the gross profit figure to achieve EBIT.\n\n## Understanding EBIT\n\nEBIT measures the profit a company generates from its operations making it synonymous with operating profit. By ignoring taxes and interest expense, EBIT focuses solely on a company's ability to generate earnings from operations, ignoring variables such as the tax burden and [capital structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp). EBIT is an especially useful metric because it helps to identify a company's ability to generate enough earnings to be profitable, pay down [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp), and fund ongoing operations.\n\n### EBIT and Taxes\n\nEBIT is also helpful to investors who are comparing multiple companies with different tax situations. For example, let's say an investor is thinking of buying [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) in a company, EBIT can help to identify the operating profit of the company without taxes being factored into the analysis. If the company recently received a tax break or there was a cut in corporate taxes in the United States, the company's [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) or profit would increase.\n\nHowever, EBIT removes the benefits from the tax cut out of the analysis. EBIT is helpful when investors are comparing two companies in the same industry but with different tax rates.\n\n### EBIT and Debt\n\nEBIT is helpful in analyzing companies that are in [capital-intensive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalintensive.asp) industries, meaning the companies have a significant amount of [fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp) on their balance sheets. Fixed assets are physical property, plant, and equipment and are typically financed by debt. For example, companies in the oil and gas industry are capital-intensive because they have to finance their drilling equipment and oil rigs.\n\nAs a result, capital-intensive industries have high-interest expenses due to a large amount of debt on their balance sheets. However, the debt, if managed properly, is necessary for the long-term growth of companies in the industry.\n\nCompanies in capital-intensive industries might have more or less debt when compared to each other. As a result, the companies would have more or fewer interest expenses when compared to each other. EBIT helps investors to analyze companies' operating performance and [earnings potential](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earning-potential.asp) while stripping out debt and the resulting interest expense.\n\n## Using EBIT\n\nLet's say you're thinking of investing in a company that manufactures machine parts. At the end of the company's fiscal year last year, the following financial information was on their income statement:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Revenue: } \\\\$10,000,000\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Cost Of Goods Sold: } \\\\$3,000,000\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Gross Profit: } \\\\$7,000,000 \\\\end{aligned}​Revenue: $10,000,000Cost Of Goods Sold: $3,000,000Gross Profit: $7,000,000​﻿\n\nThe company's gross profit would equal $7,000,000 or the profit before overhead expenses are subtracted. The company had the following overhead expenses, which are listed as sales, general, and administrative expenses:\n\nSG\\\\&A: \\\\$2,000,000*SG*&*A*:$2,000,000﻿\n\nThe operating income or EBIT for the company would be gross profit minus SG&A:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\text{EBIT: } &\\\\$5,000,000\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{or }(\\\\$10,000,000\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\$3,000,000\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\$2,000,000) \\\\end{aligned}EBIT: ​$5,000,000or ($10,000,000 − $3,000,000 − $2,000,000)​﻿\n\n### EBIT Applications\n\nThere are different ways to calculate EBIT, which is not a GAAP​ metric, and so is not usually labeled specifically as EBIT in financial statements (it may be reported as operating profits in a company's income statement).1 Always begin with total revenue or total sales and subtract [operating expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp), including the cost of goods sold. You may take out one-time or extraordinary items, such as the revenue from the sale of an asset or the cost of a lawsuit, as these do not relate to the business's core operations.\n\nAlso, if a company has [non-operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-operating-income.asp), such as income from investments, this may be (but does not have to be) included. In this case, EBIT is distinct from operating income, which, as the name implies, does not include non-operating income.\n\nOften, companies include interest income in EBIT, but some may exclude it depending on its source. If the company extends credit to its customers as an integral part of its business, then this interest income is a component of operating income, and a company will always include it. If, on the other hand, the interest income is derived from [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) investments, or charging fees to customers that pay their bills late, it may be excluded. As with the other adjustments mentioned, this adjustment is at the investor's discretion and should be applied consistently to all companies being compared.\n\nAnother way to calculate EBIT is by taking the net income figure (profit) from the income statement and adding the [income tax expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-expense.asp) and [interest expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp) back into net income.\n\n## EBIT vs. EBITDA\n\nEBIT is a company's operating profit without interest expense and taxes. However, EBITDA or (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) takes EBIT and strips out [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp), and [amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp) expenses when calculating profitability. Like EBIT, EBITDA also excludes taxes and interest expenses on debt. But, there are [differences between EBIT and EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020215/what-difference-between-ebit-and-ebitda.asp).\n\nFor companies with a significant amount of fixed assets, they can depreciate the expense of purchasing those assets over their useful life. In other words, depreciation allows a company to spread the cost of an asset over many years or the life of the asset. Depreciation saves a company from recording the cost of the asset in the year the asset was purchased. As a result, depreciation expense reduces profitability.\n\nFor company's with a significant amount of fixed assets, depreciation expense can impact net income or the bottom line. EBITDA measures a company's profits by removing depreciation. As a result, EBITDA helps to drill down to the profitability of a company's operational performance. EBIT and EBITDA each have their merits and uses in financial analysis.\n\n## Limitations of EBIT\n\nAs stated earlier, depreciation is included in the EBIT calculation and can lead to varying results when comparing companies in different industries. If an investor is comparing a company with a significant amount of fixed assets to a company that has few fixed assets, the depreciation expense would hurt the company with the fixed assets since the expense reduces net income or profit.\n\nAlso, companies with a large amount of debt will likely have a high amount of interest expense. EBIT removes the interest expense and thus inflates a company's earnings potential, particularly if the company has substantial debt. Not including debt in the analysis can be problematic if the company increases its debt due to a lack of cash flow or poor sales performance. It is also important to consider that in a rising rate environment, interest expense will rise for companies that carry debt on their balance sheet and must be considered when analyzing a company's financials.\n\nLastly, calculating EBIT can be difficult, especially for those who might be unfamiliar with it. Anyone struggling with determining this value may want to consider reaching out to one of the [best online accounting firms](https://www.investopedia.com/best-accounting-firms-5094262).\n\n## Real-World Example of EBIT\n\nAs an example, below is Procter & Gamble Co's income statement from the year ending June 30, 2016 (all figures in millions of USD):2\n\n**Net sales**65,299     Cost of products sold32,909**Gross profit**32,390     Selling, general and administrative expense18,949**Operating income**13,441     Interest expense579     Interest income182     Other non-operating income, net325Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes13,369     Income taxes on continuing operations3,342Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations577Net earnings10,604     Less: net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests96Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble10,508\n\nTo calculate EBIT, we subtract the cost of goods sold and the SG&A expense from the net sales. However, P&G had other types of income that can be included in the EBIT calculation. P&G had non-operating income and interest income, and in this case, we calculate EBIT as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{EBIT}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{NS}\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\text{COGS}\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\text{SG\\\\&A}\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\text{NOI}\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\text{II}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\text{EBIT}\\\\ &=\\\\ \\\\$65,299\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\$32,909\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\$18,949\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\$325\\\\\\\\ &\\\\quad+\\\\ \\\\$182\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\$13,948 \\\\end{aligned}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{NS}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Net sales}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{SG\\\\&A}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Selling, general, and administrative expenses}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{NOI}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Non-operating income}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{II}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Interest income} \\\\end{aligned}​EBIT = NS − COGS − SG&A + NOI + IIEBIT ​= $65,299 − $32,909 − $18,949 + $325+ $182 = $13,948​where:NS = Net salesSG&A = Selling, general, and administrative expensesNOI = Non-operating incomeII = Interest income​\n\nFor the fiscal year ended 2015, P&G had a Venezuelan charge. Whether to include the Venezuela charge raises questions. As mentioned above, a company can exclude one-time expenses. In this case, a note in the 2015 earnings release explained that the company was continuing to operate in the country through subsidiaries. Due to [capital controls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_conrol.asp) in effect at the time, P&G was taking a one-time hit to remove Venezuelan assets and [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp) from its balance sheet.\n\nSimilarly, we can make an argument for excluding interest income and other non-operating income from the equation. These considerations are to some extent subjective, but we should apply consistent criteria to all companies being compared. For some companies, the amount of interest income they report might be negligible, and it can be omitted. However, other companies, such as banks, generate a substantial amount of interest income from the investments they hold in bonds or debt instruments.\n\nAnother way to calculate P&G's fiscal 2015 EBIT is to work from the bottom up, beginning with net earnings. We ignore [non-controlling interests](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncontrolling_interest.asp), as we are only concerned with the company's operations and subtract net earnings from [discontinued operations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discontinued-operations.asp) for the same reason. We then add income taxes and interest expense back in to obtain the same EBIT we did via the top-down method:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{EBIT}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{NE}\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\text{NEDO}\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\text{IT}\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\text{IE}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\text{Therefore, EBIT}\\\\ &=\\\\ \\\\$10,604\\\\ -\\\\ \\\\$577\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\$3,342\\\\\\\\ &\\\\quad +\\\\ \\\\$579\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\$13,948\\\\end{aligned}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{NE}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Net earnings}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{NEDO}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Net earnings from discontinued operations}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{IT}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Income taxes}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{IE}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\text{Interest expense} \\\\end{aligned}​EBIT = NE − NEDO + IT + IETherefore, EBIT ​= $10,604 − $577 + $3,342+ $579 = $13,948​where:NE = Net earningsNEDO = Net earnings from discontinued operationsIT = Income taxesIE = Interest expense​\n\n## Why Is EBIT Important?\n\nEBIT is an important measure of a firm's operating efficiency. Because it does not take into account indirect expenses such as taxes and interest due on debts, it shows how much the business makes from its core operations.\n\n## How Is EBIT Calculated?\n\nEBIT is calculated by subtracting a company's cost of goods sold (COGS) and its operating expenses from its revenue. EBIT can also be calculated as operating revenue and non-operating income, less operating expenses.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between EBIT and EBITDA?\n\nBoth EBIT and EBITDA strip out the cost of debt financing and taxes, while EBITDA takes another step by putting depreciation and amortization expenses back into the profit of a company. Since depreciation is not captured in EBITDA, it can lead to profit distortions for companies with a sizable amount of fixed assets and subsequently substantial depreciation expenses. The larger the depreciation expense, the more it will boost EBITDA. \n\n## How Do Analysts and Investors Use EBIT?\n\nAside from getting an idea of profitability from operations, EBIT is used in several financial ratios used in fundamental analysis.

{"id": "RZMlvNhVW-tKKMV_BRd8PyruA_NAa-Wd7vW6oY6n2C4", "title": "EBITDA — Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization", "body": "## What Is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)?\n\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a measure of a company’s overall [financial performance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialperformance.asp) and is used as an alternative to [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) in some circumstances. EBITDA, however, can be misleading because it does not reflect the cost of capital investments like property, plants, and equipment.\n\nThis metric also excludes expenses associated with debt by adding back [interest expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp) and taxes to earnings. Nonetheless, it is a more precise measure of corporate performance since it is able to show earnings before the influence of accounting and financial deductions.\n\nSimply put, EBITDA is a measure of profitability. While there is no legal requirement for companies to disclose their EBITDA, according to U.S. [generally accepted accounting principles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) (GAAP), it can be worked out and reported using the information found in a company’s [financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp).\n\nThe earnings, tax, and interest figures are found on the income statement, while the depreciation and amortization figures are normally found in the notes to operating profit or on the cash flow statement. The usual shortcut to calculating EBITDA is to start with operating profit, also called [earnings before interest and tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT), then add back depreciation and amortization.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is a widely used metric of corporate profitability.\n* EBITDA can be used to compare companies against each other and industry averages.\n* EBITDA is a good measure of core profit trends because it eliminates some extraneous factors and provides a more accurate comparison between companies.\n* EBITDA can be used as a shortcut to estimate the cash flow available to pay the debt of long-term assets.\n\n0 seconds of 25 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n0:25\n\n#### EBITDA\n\n## EBITDA Formula and Calculation\n\n[EBITDA is calculated in a straightforward manner](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031815/what-formula-calculating-ebitda.asp), with information that is easily found on a company’s [income statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp) and [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp). There are two formulas used to calculate EBITDA, one that uses operating income and the other net income. The two EBITDA calculations are:\n\n> *EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + Depreciation & Amortization*\n\nand\n\n> *EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization*\n\n## Understanding EBITDA\n\nEBITDA is essentially net income (or earnings) with [interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp), [taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxes.asp), [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp), and [amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp) added back. EBITDA can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries, as it eliminates the effects of financing and capital expenditures. EBITDA is often used in valuation ratios and can be compared to [enterprise value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) and [revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp).\n\nInterest expenses and (to a lesser extent) interest income are added back to net income, which neutralizes the [cost of debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofdebt.asp) and the effect that interest payments have on taxes. Income taxes are also added back to net income, which does not always increase EBITDA if the company has a [net loss](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netloss.asp). Companies tend to spotlight their EBITDA performance when they do not have very impressive (or even positive) net income. It’s not always a telltale sign of malicious market trickery, but it can sometimes be used to distract investors from the lack of real profitability.\n\nCompanies use depreciation and amortization accounts to expense the cost of property, plants, and equipment, or [capital investments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-investment.asp). Amortization is often used to expense the cost of software development or other [intellectual property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp). This is one of the reasons why early-stage technology and research companies feature EBITDA when communicating with investors and analysts.\n\nManagement teams will argue that using EBITDA gives a better picture of profit growth trends when the expense accounts associated with capital are excluded. While there is nothing necessarily misleading about using EBITDA as a growth metric, it can sometimes overshadow a company’s actual financial performance and [risks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp). \n \n\n## EBITDA and Leveraged Buyouts\n\nEBITDA first came to prominence in the mid-1980s, when [leveraged buyout](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp) investors examined [distressed companies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distressedsecurities.asp) that needed financial [restructuring](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restructuring.asp). They used EBITDA to calculate quickly whether these companies could pay back the interest on these financed deals.\n\nLeveraged buyout bankers promoted EBITDA as a tool to determine whether a company could service its debt in the short term. These bankers claimed that looking at the company’s [EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitdacoverinterestratio.asp) would give investors a sense of whether a company could meet the heavier interest payments that it would face after restructuring. For instance, bankers might argue that a company with EBITDA of $5 million and interest charges of $2.5 million had interest coverage of two—more than enough to pay off debt.\n\nEBITDA was a popular metric in the 1980s to measure a company’s ability to service the debt used in a leveraged buyout. Using a limited measure of profits before a company has become fully leveraged in a leveraged buyout is appropriate. EBITDA was popularized further during the [dotcom bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp), when companies had very expensive assets and debt loads that were obscuring what analysts and managers felt were legitimate growth numbers.\n\n## The Drawbacks of EBITDA\n\nEBITDA does not fall under the above-mentioned GAAP as a measure of financial performance. Because EBITDA is a “non-GAAP” measure, its calculation can vary from one company to the next. It is not uncommon for companies to emphasize EBITDA over net income because it is more flexible and can distract from other problem areas in the financial statements.\n\nAn important red flag for investors to watch is when a company starts to report EBITDA prominently but hasn’t done so in the past. This can happen when companies have borrowed heavily or are experiencing rising capital and development costs. In this circumstance, EBITDA can serve as a distraction for investors and may be misleading.\n\n### Ignores Costs of Assets\n\nA common misconception is that EBITDA represents cash earnings. However, unlike [free cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp), EBITDA ignores the cost of assets. One of the most common criticisms of EBITDA is that it assumes profitability is a function of sales and operations alone—almost as if the assets and financing the company needs to survive were a gift.\n\n### Ignores Working Capital\n\nEBITDA also leaves out the cash required to fund [working capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) and the replacement of old equipment. For example, a company may be able to sell a product for a profit, but what did it use to acquire the [inventory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp) needed to fill its sales channels? In the case of a software company, EBITDA does not recognize the expense of developing the current software versions or upcoming products.\n\n### Varying Starting Points\n\nWhile subtracting interest payments, tax charges, depreciation, and amortization from earnings may seem simple enough, different companies use different earnings figures as the starting point for EBITDA. In other words, EBITDA is susceptible to the earnings accounting games found on the income statement. Even if we account for the distortions that result from interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization, the earnings figure in EBITDA is still unreliable.\n\n### Obscures Company Valuation\n\nWorst of all, [EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061515/which-metric-should-i-pay-more-attention-evebitda-or-pe.asp) can make a company look less expensive than it really is. When analysts look at stock price multiples of EBITDA rather than at bottom-line earnings, they produce lower multiples.\n\nConsider the historical example of wireless telecom operator Sprint Nextel. On April 1, 2006, the stock was trading at 7.3 times its forecast EBITDA. That might sound like a low multiple, but it doesn’t mean the company is a bargain. As a multiple of forecast operating profits, Sprint Nextel traded at a much-higher 20 times. The company traded at 48 times its estimated net income.\n\nInvestors need to consider other price multiples than EBITDA when assessing a company’s value. \n \n\n## EBITDA vs. EBT and EBIT\n\nThe above-mentioned EBIT (**e**arnings **b**efore **i**nterest and **t**axes) is a company’s net income before income tax expense and interest expense have been deducted. EBIT is used to analyze the performance of a company’s core operations without tax expenses and the costs of the capital structure influencing profit. The following formula is used to calculate EBIT: \n\n\\\\textit{EBIT} = \\\\text{Net Income} + \\\\text{Interest Expense} + \\\\text{Tax Expense}*EBIT*=Net Income+Interest Expense+Tax Expense\n\nSince net income includes the deductions of interest expense and tax expense, they need to be added back into net income to calculate EBIT. EBIT is often referred to as operating income since they both exclude taxes and interest expenses in their calculations. However, there are times when [operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp) can differ from EBIT.\n\n[Earnings before tax (EBT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebt.asp) reflects how much of an operating profit has been realized before accounting for taxes, while EBIT excludes both taxes and interest payments. EBT is calculated by taking net income and adding taxes back in to calculate a company’s profit.\n\nBy removing [tax liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp), investors can use EBT to evaluate a firm’s operating performance after eliminating a variable outside of its control. In the United States, this is most useful for comparing companies that might have different state taxes or federal taxes. EBT and EBIT are similar to each other and are both variations of EBITDA.\n\nSince depreciation is not captured in EBITDA, it can lead to profit distortions for companies with a sizable amount of fixed assets and subsequently substantial depreciation expenses. The larger the depreciation expense, the more it will boost EBITDA.\n\n## EBITDA vs. Operating Cash Flow\n\n[Operating cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingcashflow.asp) is a better measure of how much cash a company is generating because it adds non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization) back to net income and includes the changes in working capital that also use or provide cash (such as changes in receivables, payables, and inventories).\n\nThese working-capital factors are the key to determining how much cash a company is generating. If investors do not include changes in working capital in their analysis and [rely solely on EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012015/what-difference-between-cash-flow-and-ebidta.asp), they will miss clues that indicate whether a company is struggling with cash flow because it’s not collecting on its receivables.\n\n## Examples of EBITDA\n\nA retail company generates $100 million in revenue and incurs $40 million in [production costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production-cost.asp) and $20 million in [operating expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp). Depreciation and amortization expenses total $10 million, yielding an operating profit of $30 million. Interest expense is $5 million, which equals earnings before taxes of $25 million. With a 20% tax rate, net income equals $20 million after $5 million in taxes are subtracted from pretax income. If depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes are added back to net income, EBITDA equals $40 million.\n\nNet Income**$20,000,000**Depreciation Amortization+$10,000,000Interest Expense+$5,000,000Taxes+$5,000,000EBITDA**$40,000,000**\n\nMany investors use EBITDA to make comparisons between companies with different [capital structures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp) or tax jurisdictions. Assuming that two companies are both profitable on an EBITDA basis, a comparison like this could help investors identify a company that is growing more quickly from a product sales perspective.\n\nFor example, imagine two companies with different capital structures but a similar business. Company A has a current EBITDA of $20 million, and Company B has EBITDA of $17.5 million. An analyst is evaluating both firms to determine which has the most attractive value.\n\nFrom the information presented so far, it makes sense to assume that Company A should be trading at a higher total value than Company B. However, once the operational expenses of depreciation and amortization are added back in, along with interest expense and taxes, the relationship between the two companies is clearer.\n\n **Company ACompany B**EBITDA**$20,000,000$17,500,000**Depreciation Amortization-$2,000,000-$2,500,000Interest Expense-$8,000,000-$5,000,000Taxes-$2,000,000-$2,000,000Net Income**$8,000,000$8,000,000**\n\nIn this example, both companies have the same net income largely because Company B has a smaller interest expense account. There are a few possible conclusions that can help the analyst dig a little deeper into the true value of these two companies:\n\n* Is it possible that Company B could borrow more and increase both EBITDA and net income? If the company is underutilizing its ability to borrow, this could be a source of potential growth and value.\n* If both companies have the same amount of debt, perhaps Company A has a lower [credit rating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) and must pay a higher [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp). This may indicate additional risk compared with Company B and a lower value.\n* Based on the amount of depreciation and amortization, Company B is generating less EBITDA with more [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) than Company A. This could indicate an inefficient management team and a problem for Company B’s valuation.\n\n## How Do You Calculate Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)?\n\nYou can calculate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) by using the information from a company’s income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet. The formula is as follows:\n\nEBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization\n\n## What Is a Good EBITDA?\n\nEBITDA is a measure of a company’s financial performance and profitability, so relatively high EBITDA is clearly better than lower EBITDA. Companies of different sizes in different sectors and industries vary widely in their financial performance. Therefore, the best way to determine whether a company’s EBITDA is good is to compare its number with that of its peers—companies of similar size in the same industry and sector.\n\n## What Is Amortization in EBITDA?\n\nAs it relates to EBITDA, amortization is an accounting technique used to periodically lower the book value of intangible assets over a set period of time. Amortization is reported on a company’s financial statements. Examples of intangible assets include intellectual property such as patents or trademarks, or goodwill derived from past acquisitions.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstZzE45kKCjcsRnAt3xl6v0IsF__NgmFqD9JHARtwGqQY2fFC_MIcwQruBZLDk0yrfdVSO9cLYzNBu9Gyc0DIDmknUkFl0jSl5r8RbcvjvY9iSj0jYXpUTXjVy2A2m4PXVofqZ7jKeGoEWO3DXYXfO3mZqWN0FYPIYaBRZqR6nbk-9ZFl-hmWyJHjdLpm94vBgqh6krImBY_wOsvMEZSLDkTELTTf_AJP6cpIsArjifp-2H1vH3vVyF7lIogZu7x3TMFUIgdQSVIJIIKEP1LJQbxJ4qdmnYcvzhUv8LV1bK2YKtncA6C-HuRjD4iVDd1frCARvl92YwMcZoVkjN19KbivbNXawEEqjEsT6xMtQ9ItE&sig=Cg0ArKJSzGRsUTTgE0cQEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjstZzE45kKCjcsRnAt3xl6v0IsF__NgmFqD9JHARtwGqQY2fFC_MIcwQruBZLDk0yrfdVSO9cLYzNBu9Gyc0DIDmknUkFl0jSl5r8RbcvjvY9iSj0jYXpUTXjVy2A2m4PXVofqZ7jKeGoEWO3DXYXfO3mZqWN0FYPIYaBRZqR6nbk-9ZFl-hmWyJHjdLpm94vBgqh6krImBY_wOsvMEZSLDkTELTTf_AJP6cpIsArjifp-2H1vH3vVyF7lIogZu7x3TMFUIgdQSVIJIIKEP1LJQbxJ4qdmnYcvzhUv8LV1bK2YKtncA6C-HuRjD4iVDd1frCARvl92YwMcZoVkjN19KbivbNXawEEqjEsT6xMtQ9ItE&sig=Cg0ArKJSzGRsUTTgE0cQEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

That leads to an increase in [incomes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp), inspiring consumers to open up their wallets and buy more, which means a higher material [quality of life](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quality-of-life.asp) or standard of living.\n\nIn economics, growth is commonly modeled as a function of [physical capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physical-capital.asp), human capital, labor force, and technology. Simply put, increasing the quantity or quality of the working age population, the tools that they have to work with, and the recipes that they have available to combine [labor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand_for_labor.asp), [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp), and [raw materials](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp), [will lead to increased economic output](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/how-does-total-capital-investment-influence-economic-growth.asp).\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia 2020\n\nThere are a few ways to generate economic growth. The first is an increase in the amount of physical [capital goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgoods.asp) in the economy. Adding capital to the economy tends to increase productivity of labor. Newer, better, and more tools mean that workers can produce more output per time period. For a simple example, a fisherman with a net will catch more fish per hour than a fisherman with a pointy stick. However two things are critical to this process. Someone in the economy must first engage in some form of saving (sacrificing their current consumption) in order to free up the resources to create the new capital, and the new capital must be the right type, in the right place, at the right time for workers to actually use it productively.\n\nA second method of producing economic growth is technological improvement. An example of this is the invention of gasoline fuel; prior to the discovery of the energy-generating power of gasoline, the economic value of [petroleum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/petroleum.asp) was relatively low. The use of gasoline became a better and more productive method of transporting goods in process and distributing final goods more efficiently. Improved technology allows workers to produce more output with the same stock of capital goods, by combining them in novel ways that are more productive. Like capital growth, the rate of technical growth is highly dependent on the rate of savings and investment, since savings and investment are necessary to engage in research and development.\n\nAnother way to generate economic growth is to grow the labor force. All else equal, more workers generate more economic goods and services. During the 19th century, a portion of the robust U.S. economic growth was due to a high influx of cheap, productive immigrant labor. Like capital driven growth however, there are some key conditions to this process. Increasing the labor force also necessarily increases the amount of output that must be consumed in order to provide for the basic subsistence of the new workers, so the new workers need to be at least productive enough to offset this and not be net consumers. Also just like additions to capital, it is important for the right type of workers to flow to the right jobs in the right places in combination with the right types of complementary capital goods in order to realize their productive potential.\n\nThe last method is increases in human capital. This means laborers become more skilled at their crafts, raising their productivity through skills training, trial and error, or simply more practice. Savings, investment, and specialization are the most consistent and easily controlled methods. Human capital in this context can also refer to social and institutional capital; behavioral tendencies toward higher social trust and reciprocity and political or economic innovations like improved protections for property rights are in effect types of human capital that can increase the productivity of the economy.\n\n## Measured in Dollars, Not Goods and Services\n\nA growing or more productive economy makes more goods and provides more services than before. However, some goods and services are considered more valuable than others. For example, a smartphone is considered more valuable than a pair of socks. Growth has to be measured in the value of goods and services, not only the quantity.\n\nAnother problem is not all individuals place the same value on the same goods and services. A heater is more valuable to a resident of Alaska, while an air conditioner is more valuable to a resident of Florida. Some people value steak more than fish, and vice versa. Because value is subjective, measuring for all individuals is very tricky.\n\nThe common approximation is to use the [current market value.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmv.asp) In the United States, this is measured in terms of U.S. dollars and added all together to produce aggregate measures of output including [Gross Domestic Product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp).\n\nThe Complete Introduction to Economics\n\nLearning the basics of economics is easier than you think, especially when [courses are taught by instructors from all over the world.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuivaQCXeYtNtRxXJOQ6k34JirNElzFyCc6BH5kZ3DqCqSR5I70NWGBLSCXWRVKotPAGmggQiQxnlMhSZn0WFVmzvozOczg3R75bzGfsE8GD09-NW9cG7D4n3NwPhBg573iTpaz6GcSx4QNH-chV0-NBJI2VoS4g9zEQBGMEwI-_dOtxH_RrTSPry5_0tov9jQMV-DnatNsttoUHiJZNVOVRvMgMoZXtHiyVPVI2H0987cUF1BBaXkYYu5fkh5nIyRmnqUV54JEPLv9E7zOtfBSYGCckpOs3T8HA2v7aBwg1_a7VcSDWahiJ0nta8quTlLhHPm-szBDOw7X&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEgPp7zVpYhBEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [understand what economics is all about](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsuivaQCXeYtNtRxXJOQ6k34JirNElzFyCc6BH5kZ3DqCqSR5I70NWGBLSCXWRVKotPAGmggQiQxnlMhSZn0WFVmzvozOczg3R75bzGfsE8GD09-NW9cG7D4n3NwPhBg573iTpaz6GcSx4QNH-chV0-NBJI2VoS4g9zEQBGMEwI-_dOtxH_RrTSPry5_0tov9jQMV-DnatNsttoUHiJZNVOVRvMgMoZXtHiyVPVI2H0987cUF1BBaXkYYu5fkh5nIyRmnqUV54JEPLv9E7zOtfBSYGCckpOs3T8HA2v7aBwg1_a7VcSDWahiJ0nta8quTlLhHPm-szBDOw7X&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEgPp7zVpYhBEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Feconomics%2F) and the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

Rowhouses, garden homes, patio homes, and townhomes are all types of properties that may be zero-lot-line homes. They may be attached (as in a townhouse) or a detached single story or multistory residence.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A zero-lot-line house is a piece of residential real estate in which the structure comes up to, or very near to, the edge of the property line.\n* Zero-lot-line houses can be attached or detached, and are especially popular in urban areas.\n* Noise and proximity to neighbors can be disadvantages to zero-lot-line homes.\n* Low maintenance and lower prices are advantages of zero-lot-line homes.\n\n## Understanding a Zero-Lot-Line House\n\nZero-lot-line houses are built very close to their boundary lines to create more usable space for the residence. Because there is virtually no space left over they are called \"zero lot.\" With a zero-lot-line house, the buyer only has to pay for a lot large \n enough to hold the house. Such a home confers savings to purchasers who \n cannot afford a larger lot or do not feel they need one enough to \n justify the expense.\n\nThese homes are especially popular in urban renewal settings. In places with high population density, such as the urban core of a large metropolitan area, zero-lot-line houses impart buyers with options beyond the typical lofts and condos while maintaining the ability to provide housing for large numbers of people in a tightly circumscribed area.\n\n## Zero-Lot-Line House Advantages\n\nThough they cost less than homes with lots of extra acreage, zero-lot-line homes are not just for low-income homebuyers; they are an attractive option for anyone who doesn't have the time or inclination to maintain landscaping. Not leaving room in the property plot for a yard allows for maximum square footage in the home. Zero-lot homes offer many of the advantages of actual \n houses—without the time-consuming demands of upkeep and the expense of \n large backyards or front lawns.\n\nThese homes are also an appealing alternative to [condos](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/09/issues-purchasing-condo.asp) because they offer greater privacy and independence while still being low-maintenance. A common complaint in condominium settings is that a homeowner shares walls with as many as five neighbors, increasing the chances of noise disturbances from neighbors and eroding any sense of privacy. While certain zero-lot-line homes, such as townhouses and rowhouses, still include shared walls, there are fewer of them. Other zero-lot-line options, such as garden homes, offer homeowners the freedom of a standalone structure.\n\nBecause zero lot developments often incorporate shared spaces into their design—features such as shared back alleys and front porches right at the street—many of these home encourage a real sense of community among neighbors.\n\n## Zero-Lot-Line House Disadvantages\n\nWindow placement, noise, and a lack of privacy can be issues with these types of homes since there is little to no buffer zone surrounding them. Moreover, because zero-lot-line homes typically feature less setback from the road compared to homes on larger lots, noise from passing cars may be of constant concern, particularly if the home is situated on a busy thoroughfare.\n\nZero-lot-line houses can create challenges among neighbors, especially in areas where people are used to having larger buffer zones. In traditionally dense neighborhoods where residents are used to living in close quarters, smaller buffer zones are less of a challenge.\n\nFinally, zero-lot-line homes might fetch less on the real estate market, especially in boom times. Lots of land around a home still connote luxury and value, and provide homeowners with flexibility to expand. To some, a zero-lot-line home could represent the worst of all worlds: all the noise and lack of privacy of an apartment, with the upkeep of a free-standing structure, but without compensatory acreage and space.", "timestamp": 1654659298, "digest": "hFIBLlg4Uif9QBcYqCzmWYUO5xxnbj51l6OK6tExAdw", "contributor": "0xF17EA66eE519b2E871db6af203b0C8182C115da5"}

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hnaBZ0bPIF0rSL7I_JjQv.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n价值有多种形式。我们根据自己的世界观，可能会高估或贬低某物的价值。尽管如此，价值依旧代表了无法估量的变量纠缠。而且从根本上讲，这些变量始终是主观的。\n\n \n\n但是我不仅是一个创作者，还是一位商人。我想找出那些增加价值的因素，这样我就可以增加我的艺术、产品和服务的价值。虽然我永远无法掌控其他人的感受，但是我可以控制我创造的东西的价值，然后通过扩展去塑造人们在市场上的看法。\n\n \n\n这种复杂且有些难以理解的价值表述在 NFT 市场中具有新的意义。Beeple 的 NFT 杰作《Everydays: The First 5000 Days》怎么能卖到超过 69,000,000 美元？有人会说“它只是一个jpeg”。但事实证明他们是错误的，因为市场确定它确实价值 69,000,000 美元。\n\n \n\n这是一个事实。也许它被高估了，也许花 69,000,000 美元购买食物和建造工厂以达到严格的功利目的会更好。但是，这并非是一个令人满意的答案。我们有时买东西并不是为了达到功利的满足。有时我们会对传说和审美艺术如此着迷，相比之下，金钱就显得一文不值。\n\n \n\n《Everydays: The First 5000 Days》中包含了很多艺术深度。无论是 NFT 还是传说中的文艺复兴时期的油画，很少有艺术品能达到如此高的市场价值。这些作品的某些方面还赋予了它们在人类生活背景下的意义，并由此延伸到以人类为中心的人类资本估值。\n\n \n\n以下的 10 个属性对于任何希望将 NFT 项目作为其生态系统一部分的创作人员来说都是一个福音。如今有太多的骗子进入了 NFT 领域，人们忽视了艺术的基本经济学规律。是时候应用这些简单而永恒的真理来构建新一代的重要项目了。\n\n \n\n**1.效用**\n\n \n\n世界各地的经济学家和流行语爱好者现在可能会欣喜若狂，因为我们在谈论效用。在深入研究效用在 NFT 项目中的真正含义之前，让我们先探讨一下经济学中效用的标准概念。全世界经济学学生学到的最著名的效用模型是将效用定义为三种基本资源（土地、劳动力和资本）中任何一种的内在价值。当我们谈到艺术品和 NFT 时，我们显然在谈论一种资本形式。这意味着 NFT 具有多少内在价值的问题取决于其效用。\n\n \n\n### \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0EHq-9lv2hFI00oKKq0rJ.png?height=362&width=480)\n\n###  \n\n效用对不同的人可能意味着不同的事情。尤其是当我们面对的是无形资产时。在 NFT 社区中，“效用”通常指的是NFT 会赋予它的拥有者所能做的很酷的事情。比如能够转移 NFT，成为该NFT项目的独家社区的一部分，甚至可以参加私人活动。更进一步，我相信我们对像 Beeple's Everydays这样的作品，它所赋予的美学意义也是一种效用的形式。它是一种与人类灵魂产生共鸣的效用形式，为我们的日常生活增添了一层意义。\n\n \n\n我认为艺术实用性的这些更微妙和人道主义甚至是精神的方面，往往会被许多经济学家在更务实的观点中所忽略。谈到 NFT，我们确实会将其在经济学规律和形而上学的艺术体验之间划清界限。此列表的其余部分将着眼于如何将这两个方面最大化。\n\n \n\n**2.社区**\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NnnI1epZrKbs4aESdVtLn.png?height=480&width=480)\n\n \n\n当我们看到像 Beeple's Everydays这样的作品时，会很容易理解这就是艺术市场的现状。这与已达到天文价格的毕加索或班克斯的作品并没有什么不同。\n\n \n\n但是当卡通猴子卖到几十万美元时呢？Cryptopunks和Bored Ape Yacht Club等项目目前在以疯狂的溢价出售。使这些项目以如此高的溢价销售的原因是围绕着他们所形成的名人和影响者社区。Bored Ape 游艇俱乐部拥有令人难以置信的排他性，这似乎可以称之为一个秘密社团。\n\n \n\n值得一提的是，对象的效用会随着时间而变化。“领主”的头衔在现代英国并不像在 15 世纪的英国那么有价值。社区起起落落。尽管如此，这仍然是效用方程的重要组成部分。在许多方面，我将社区建设视为营销的核心活动。\n\n \n\n即使在 Beeple's Everydays 的案例中，它之所以能引起如此富有的艺术品收藏家的关注，也是因为 Beeple 通过连续 5000 天持续推出高质量艺术品而建立的社区和声誉。每天都是人类坚韧潜力的证明。这种坚韧的精神建立了一个愿意支付 69,000,000 美元的社区。\n\n \n\n对于今天寻求构建 NFT 项目的创意人士来说，我相信社区是决定项目成败的第一因素。这就是为什么我认为 NFT 非常适合音乐家和影响者。它成为连接那些已经非常忠诚的社区并为其增值的强大工具。\n\n \n\n**3.多平台生态系统**\n\n \n\n好吧，老实说，这只是用不同的词来表述的“社区”。我所说的“多平台生态系统”是指在多个不同渠道中培养一个充满活力的社区。在围绕去中心化、Web 3.0 和 NFT 的所有炒作中，我看到许多爱好者忽略了与人实际联系的重要性，而只是关注概念。\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dwShah7UwlhyLWtoRYy_V.png?height=212&width=499)\n\n \n\n平台在不断变化，并且人们存在对某个平台产生情感依赖或反感的趋势。如果在拥抱 NFT 和 Web 3.0愿景的过程中，你忽略了一些可以帮助你创造性工作的社区，放弃了他们赖以生存的平台，那将会是一个巨大的损失。我看到许多音乐家如此坚决地淘汰 Spotify，以至于他们失去了绝大多数潜在的粉丝。\n\n \n\n我也是 Spotify 和 Web 2.0 的批评者。但是，我在试图做一个公正的批评者。事实是，如果您是创作者、影响者或企业家，在多个平台上为您的社区创造有意义的体验是符合您的最大利益的。\n\n \n\n我的文章《10 个构建社区的平台》，介绍了如何最优地建立您的多平台生态系统足迹。通过利用多平台生态系统的力量，无论身在何处，拥有创建社区的最佳技能的创作者也将创建出最好的 NFT 社区。\n\n \n\n**4.正确的区块链**\n\n \n\n我有时会谈论一个虽然不幸但真实的现实，这让我在加密社区中遇到很多麻烦。那就是普通消费者并不想了解 Avalanche、以太坊、Stellar 或最新的shitcoin 之间的细微差别。\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OEQKV-u29L4xXd3hV-ieK.png?height=368&width=480)\n\n \n\n老实说，目前还没有关于什么是“正确”区块链的标准。实际上，很有可能一些新标准还会完全抹去我们目前为区块链制定的每一个“标准”。例如，以太坊现在已经得到了大众的认可。但仅在该网络上进行交易也是非常的昂贵。对于许多涉足 NFT 的独立创作者来说，在以太坊上构建该项目是零意义的。可能是因为“贫穷的艺术家”没有 500,000 美元来铸造新的 NFT 产品线。这同时意味着许多其他更便宜，但标准化程度较低的加密货币（例如 Stellar Lumens）填补了这一空白。\n\n \n\n除了费用和受欢迎程度的影响之外，还要考虑在将 NFT 艺术品、收藏品和财产带入元宇宙时，这些区块链是否会支持。例如需要了解 Meta (Facebook)，他们选择构建一个开放的区块链系统，甚至支持更流行的基于区块链的 NFT 的可能性有多大。我认为他们更有可能建立一个封闭的系统，其中只支持专门的基于“Meta”或“Libra”的 NFT。这当然还有待观察，但对于那些只想为他们的社区建立 NFT 项目的独立创作者来说，这一切都让他们陷入了困境。\n\n \n\n我的建议是，选择一个当前对您的特定社区而言易于访问且负担得起的区块链。只要您将社区放在首位并完全致力于您的项目，他们就会明白您是否需要迁移到一个新的区块链或创建一个多链兼容的系统。\n\n \n\n**5.长期关注**\n\n \n\n对于任何花了数年甚至数十年时间专注于自己的工艺的艺术家来说，长期关注的必要性应该是很自然的。为了让你的NFT项目在多年以后看来依然有价值，我相信长期的关注非常重要。\n\n \n\n您需要长期关注信息，使您的NFT项目能在不仅12个月后对收藏家来说有价值，而且能够在12年后依然对收藏家有价值。当然，随着时间流逝，很多事情必然会发生变化，但你作为创作者，必须承担起让收藏家感到难忘、有意义和有价值的体验的重担。\n\n \n\n**6.流动性**\n\n \n\n我真的不想在这个列表中对属性进行排名。但是，老实说，流动性需要排在列表的底部附近。因为如果您专注于其他所有事情，流动性就会自然而然地到来。如果你过分关注流动性，项目就会受到影响。\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dFpSvVEn8V3C-qzc_gDnQ.png?height=374&width=500)\n\n \n\n简而言之，流动性代表了人们在投资 NFT 时可以期望的有形投资回报。对于创作者来说，这实际上并不重要。让自己的NFT提供值得收藏的效用价值显然是更重要的。尽管如此，由于有足够的需求为项目产生更大的流动性，收藏家会本能地认为该项目具有更高的效用。\n\n \n\n增加项目需求和流动性的唯一方法是增强项目周围的社区和整体效用。但是，请记住，那些在这个领域过分关注流动性的人大概率是骗子。\n\n \n\n**7.知识产权**\n\n \n\n除了像 Bored Ape Yacht Club 这样的项目社区之外，一些项目还开发了一种独特的知识产权为公众所认可。该 IP 既存在于区块链上，也存在于区块链之外。诸如 Pokemon、Disney 和 Magic: The Gathering 等 IP 在任何它所代表的形式中都具有内在价值。\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vbg7afqGF4UXBIyHydMdc.png?height=480&width=480)\n\n \n\n强大的知识产权是由许多因素组成的。当谈到这些重要因素时，立即浮现在我们脑海中的大多是知名度、受欢迎程度、视觉艺术性和持久的遗产。虽然最知名的知识产权可能会在一年的改编和销售中创造数十亿美元，但实际上任何人都可以创造知识产权。\n\n \n\n要建立知识产权，您所要做的就是运用您的思想，将富有想象力的创造转化为可传播的媒介。知识产权是一种罕见的资本形式，可以完全在您的脑海中创造。事实上，人类历史上每一项最伟大的发明都最初来源于你的内心。\n\n \n\n对于任何希望将 NFT 带入社区的创作者来说，投入大量精力来创建强大的 IP 并创造可收藏的代币是非常值得的。\n\n \n\n**8.诚信**\n\n \n\n社区第一。没有什么比这更需要说的了。\n\n \n\n**9.美学**\n\n \n\n诚然，我不是一个伟大的视觉艺术家。我在设计方面功底很扎实，但我绝不是一个受过专业训练和实践的视觉艺术家。通常，我会委托其他艺术家为我自己的个人品牌工作。尽管如此，我自己也会尽可能多地尝试并继续发展这项技能。\n\n \n\n无论您的视觉艺术能力怎么样，重要的是要对自己保持透明。认清自己的长处和短处。NFT 在这个时候是一个非常直观的媒介。NFT 的视觉样式将是决定 NFT 价值的最大因素之一。无论您是否是一位才华横溢的视觉艺术家，都需要关注美学。\n\n \n\n**10.直觉**\n\n \n\n我在本文中已经尽我所能将一个非常经验和直观的过程归结为一个客观模型。有了这些知识，你会找到自己创造所需要的灵感和直觉。\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Tw-Bji9cclPEAlu9pcl0R.png?height=360&width=480)\n\n \n\n为了成为一名成功的创造者，你必须愿意承担风险，必须愿意相信自己的直觉，并且充分了解并非所有事情每次都会按您期望的方式进行。但是，如果你继续通过行动和迭代来培养你的创造力，你将大大增加你成功的几率。\n\n \n\n继续用知识、艺术和观点来充实你的思想。您可以合成的越多，您就越会提升自己的原创创意。只有这样，当直觉来临时，您将准备好抓住它。\n\n \n\n**原文链接：https://medium.com/[@bendsoundwaves](https://weibo.com/n/bendsoundwaves)/10-attributes-of-a-highly-effective-nft-project-ed5f79c9779c**\n\n**翻译：千帆**\n\n**审编：XL**\n\n \n\n**加入欧科链讯社区，掌握区块链世界最新动态！**\n\n**电报频道：https://t.me/ok_telegraph**\n\n**电报社区：https://t.me/ok_telegraph_forum**\n\n**Twitter：欧科链讯**\n\n**电报搜索“欧科链讯”关注我们不迷路哦\\~​**",

{"id": "3EuuSd0ZtKtJuEI9yAoqwr_9FYi5Xh6gl2bXkoDG2Xg", "title": "Economic Moat", "body": "## What is an Economic Moat?\n\nConceptualized and named by [Warren Buffett](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp), an economic moat is a distinct advantage a company has over its competitors which allows it to protect its market share and profitability. It is often an advantage that is difficult to mimic or duplicate (brand identity, patents) and thus creates an effective barrier against competition from other firms.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 10 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:10\n\n#### Moat: My Favorite Financial Term\n\n## Understanding an Economic Moat\n\nEvery successful company understands that the main threat to their continued success will be from competitors, and keeping them at bay is critical to sustaining their dominance. With the passage of time, they are likely to see an erosion to their bottom line as competitors eat away at their market share. Which is why a business that intends to remain dominant has to establish an economic moat. Economic moat describes a company's competitive advantage derived as a result of various business tactics that allow it to earn above-average profits for a sustainable period of time.\n\nThis is important not only to the company's bottom line but also to potential investors seeking to maximize their portfolios by including companies that will maintain their performance edge. By establishing a defensible competitive advantage a company can fashion a wide enough economic moat that effectively curbs competition within their industry. Essentially, the wider the economic moat, the larger and more sustainable the competitive advantage of a firm.\n\nAn intangible asset, such as a company crafting a well-known brand name (Nike), [pricing power](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricingpower.asp) edge (Apple), cost advantages (Walmart), making it costly for customers to switch products (cell phone companies), [efficient scale](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_efficiency_scale.asp), and [network effects](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp) are all advantages that businesses can utilize to create a [wide economic moat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wide-economic-moat.asp).\n\nThe most obvious financial characteristics that companies with a wide economic moat have is that they usually generate large amounts of free cash flow and have a track record of strong returns.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* An economic moat is a distinct advantage a company has over its competitors which allows it to protect its market share and profitability.\n* It is often an advantage that is difficult to mimic or duplicate (brand identity, patents) and thus creates an effective barrier against competition from other firms.\n* The most obvious financial characteristics that companies with a wide economic moat have is that they usually generate large amounts of free cash flow and have a track record of strong returns.\n\n## Sources of Economic Moats\n\nA company that is able to maintain low operating expenses in relation to its sales compared to its peers has cost advantages, and it can undercut its competition by lowering prices and keeping rivals at bay. Consider Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has an immense volume of sales and negotiates low prices with its suppliers, resulting in low-cost products in its stores that are hard to replicate by its competitors.\n\nIntangible assets refer to the patents, brands and licenses that allow a company to protect its production process and charge premium prices. While brands are typically derived from superior product offerings and marketing, patents are obtained as a result of companies' filings with governments to protect know-hows for a specific period of time, typically 20 years. Pharmaceutical companies earn high profits due to patented drugs after spending billions on research and development.\n\nEfficient scale arises when a particular market is best served by a limited number of companies, giving them near [monopoly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp) statuses. Utility firms are examples of companies with efficient scale that is necessary to serve electricity and water to their customers in a single geographic area. Building a second utility company in the same area would be too costly and inefficient.\n\nSwitching costs is another type of economic moat, which make it very time-consuming and expensive for consumers to switch products or brands. Autodesk Inc. offers various software solutions for engineers and designers that are very difficult to learn. Once an Autodesk customer starts using its software, he is unlikely to switch, allowing Autodesk to charge premium prices for its products.\n\nThe network effect can further fortify a company's economic moat by making its products more valuable the more people use them. An example of a network effect is online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, which are widely popular among consumers because of the large quantity of people buying and selling various products through their platforms.\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "_5fG8LmeGGqjRxHCjoixP0cYBJBNQT-ZqYgZiA94D40", "title": "Economies of Scale", "body": "## What Are Economies of Scale?\n\nEconomies of scale are cost advantages reaped by companies when production becomes efficient. Companies can achieve economies of scale by increasing production and lowering costs. This happens because costs are spread over a larger number of goods. Costs can be both fixed and variable.1 \n \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Economies of scale are cost advantages companies experience when production becomes efficient, as costs can be spread over a larger amount of goods.\n* A business's size is related to whether it can achieve an economy of scale—larger companies will have more cost savings and higher production levels.\n* Economies of scale can be both internal and external. Internal economies are caused by factors within a single company while external factors affect the entire industry.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 14 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:14\n\n#### Explaining Economies Of Scale\n\n## Understanding Economies of Scale\n\nThe size of the business generally matters when it comes to economies of scale. The larger the business, the more the cost savings. Economies of scale can be both internal and external. Internal economies of scale are based on management decisions, while external ones have to do with outside factors.\n\nInternal functions include accounting, information technology, and marketing, which are also considered operational efficiencies and synergies.\n\nEconomies of scale are an important concept for any business in any industry and represent the cost-savings and competitive advantages larger businesses have over smaller ones.\n\nMost consumers don't understand why a smaller business charges more for a similar product sold by a larger company. That's because the cost per unit depends on how much the company produces. Larger companies can produce more by spreading the cost of production over a larger amount of goods. An industry may also be able to dictate the cost of a product if several different companies are producing similar goods within that industry.\n\nThere are several reasons why economies of scale give rise to lower per-unit costs. First, specialization of labor and more integrated technology boost production volumes. Second, lower per-unit costs can come from bulk orders from suppliers, larger advertising buys, or lower [costs of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp). Third, spreading internal function costs across more units produced and sold helps to reduce costs.\n\nA company can create a diseconomy of scale when it becomes too large and chases an economy of scale.2\n\n## Internal vs. External Economies of Scale\n\nAs mentioned above, there are two different types of economies of scale. Internal economies are borne from within the company. External ones are based on external factors.\n\nInternal economies of scale happen when a company cuts costs internally, so they're unique to that particular firm. This may be the result of the sheer size of a company or because of decisions from the firm's management. Larger companies may be able to achieve internal economies of scale—lowering their costs and raising their production levels—because they can buy resources in bulk, have a patent or special technology, or because they can access more capital.\n\nExternal economies of scale, on the other hand, are achieved because of external factors, or factors that affect an entire industry. That means no one company controls costs on its own. These occur when there is a highly-skilled labor pool, subsidies and/or tax reductions, and partnerships and joint ventures—anything that can cut down on costs to many companies in a specific industry.\n\n## Limits to Economies of Scale\n\nManagement techniques and technology have been focusing on limits to economies of scale for decades.\n\nSet-up costs are lower due to more flexible technology. Equipment is priced more closely to match production capacity, enabling smaller producers such as steel mini-mills and craft brewers to compete more easily.\n\nOutsourcing functional services make costs more similar across businesses of various sizes. These functional services include accounting, human resources, marketing, treasury, legal, and information technology.\n\nMicro-manufacturing, hyper-local manufacturing, and additive manufacturing ([3D printing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/3d-printing.asp)) can lower both set-up and production costs. Global trade and logistics have contributed to lower costs, regardless of the size of an individual plant. \n\nAccording the International Monetary Fund, the prices of both capital goods and the cost of machinery and equipment have been falling in emerging, developed, and even industrial countries for the past three decades.3\n\n## Examples of Economies of Scale\n\nIn a hospital, it is still a 20-minute visit with a doctor, but all the business [overhead](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overhead.asp) costs of the hospital system are spread across more doctor visits and the person assisting the doctor is no longer a degreed nurse, but a technician or nursing aide. \n\nJob shops produce products in groups such as shirts with your company logo. A significant element of the cost is the setup. In job shops, larger production runs lower unit costs because the set-up costs of designing the logo and creating the silk-screen pattern are spread across more shirts. In an assembly factory, per-unit costs are reduced by more seamless technology with robots.\n\nA restaurant kitchen is often used to illustrate how economies of scale are limited: more cooks in a small space get into each other's way. In economics charts, this has been illustrated with some flavor of a U-shaped curve, in which the average cost per unit falls and then rises. Costs rising as production volume grows is termed \"dis-economies of scale.\" \n\n## What Are Economies of Scale?\n\nEconomies of scale are the advantages that can sometimes occur as a result of increasing the size of a business. For example, a business might enjoy an economy of scale concerning its bulk purchasing. By buying a large number of products at once, it could negotiate a lower price per unit than its competitors.\n\n## What Causes Economies of Scale?\n\nGenerally speaking, economies of scale can be achieved in two ways. First, a company can realize internal economies of scale by reorganizing the way their resources—such as equipment and personnel—are distributed and used within the company. Second, a company can realize external economies of scale by growing in size relative to their competitors using that increased scale to engage in competitive practices such as negotiating discounts for bulk purchases.\n\n## Why Are Economies of Scale Important?\n\nEconomies of scale are important because they can help provide businesses with a competitive advantage in their industry. Companies will therefore try to realize economies of scale wherever possible, just as investors will try to identify economies of scale when selecting investments. One particularly famous example of an economy of scale is known as the network effect.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssLBlEbzXUYKcHMkHRFudNg2it2tXUjARx4Juqd8n0hoM1nNNRFrQR_wN0eNPKstcOmUWYvxZkg-N5opfftA9bxE_mJXBC8Blb5RUJSCnpu6IioSwLwGl6DOODDJdMbhYqSYA6_4f02SiR47xSxOL3v74J19vLrhsyUQqSDkhbTpxoF29-qJ-msArP3dgdlBwSnqdB5bYPbzByE9kuWedE5VvDEag2yycZLU7H-XsuV9z2wzT30FyLkhSJeCJzediUwfmTWMFXiYmyEfbQwZkSUfUdHm-vLwoDjl6LGD6fDvbbjAXKnjyvGpk8Q4M4FWCbL1hmKwI9T3P3nN-WrnzSo9BSxYA&sig=Cg0ArKJSzFNJrp5G4eAOEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

{"id": "92KkBKLFfwRPydewUICoTSGNbBk_z1dN17OQPWXuRmA", "title": "Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)", "body": "## What Is Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)?\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) is a process used by companies to manage and integrate the important parts of their businesses. Many ERP software applications are important to companies because they help them implement resource planning by integrating all of the processes needed to run their companies with a single system. An ERP software system can also integrate planning, purchasing inventory, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and more.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* ERP software can integrate all of the processes needed to run a company.\n* ERP solutions have evolved over the years, and many are now typically web-based applications that users can access remotely.\n* Some benefits of ERP include the free flow of communication between business areas, a single source of information, and accurate, real-time data reporting.\n* An ERP system can be ineffective if a company doesn't implement it carefully.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 34 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:34\n\n#### Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n\n## Understanding Enterprise Resource Planning\n\nYou can think of an enterprise resource planning system as the glue that binds together the different computer systems for a large organization. Without an ERP application, each department would have its system optimized for its specific tasks. With ERP software, each department still has its system, but all of the systems can be accessed through one application with one interface.\n\nERP applications also allow the different departments to communicate and share information more easily with the rest of the company. It collects information about the activity and state of different divisions, making this information available to other parts, where it can be used productively.\n\nERP applications can help a corporation become more self-aware by linking information about the production, finance, distribution, and human resources together. Because it connects different technologies used by each part of a business, an ERP application can eliminate costly duplicate and incompatible technology. The process often integrates accounts payable, stock control systems, order-monitoring systems, and customer databases into one system.\n\nERP offerings have evolved over the years from traditional software models that make use of physical client servers to cloud-based software that offers remote, web-based access.\n\nA company could experience cost overruns if its ERP system is not implemented carefully.\n\n## Benefits of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n\nBusinesses employ enterprise resource planning (ERP) for various reasons, such as expanding business, reducing costs, and improving operations. The benefits sought and realized by one company may be different from another; however, there are some worth noting.\n\nIntegrating and automating business processes eliminates redundancies, improves accuracy, and improves productivity. Departments with interconnected processes can now synchronize work to achieve faster and better outcomes.\n\nSome businesses benefit from enhanced reporting of real-time data from a single source system. Accurate and complete reporting help companies adequately plan, budget, forecast, and communicate the state of operations to the organization and interested parties, such as shareholders.\n\nERPs allow businesses to quickly access needed information for clients, vendors, and business partners, contributing to improved customer and employee satisfaction, quicker response rates, and increased accuracy rates. Associated costs often decrease as the company operates more efficiently.\n\nDepartments are better able to collaborate and share knowledge; a newly synergized workforce can improve productivity and employee satisfaction as employees are better able to see how each functional group contributes to the mission and vision of the company. Also, menial, manual tasks are eliminated, allowing employees to allocate their time to more meaningful work.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nAn ERP system doesn't always eliminate inefficiencies within the business. The company needs to rethink the way it's organized, or else it will end up with incompatible technology.\n\nERP systems usually fail to achieve the objectives that influenced their installation because of a company's reluctance to abandon old working processes that are incompatible with the software. Some companies are also reluctant to let go of old software that worked well in the past. The key is to prevent ERP projects from being split into many smaller projects, which can result in cost overruns.\n\nEmploying change management principles throughout the ERP life cycle can prevent or reduce failures that compromise full implementation.\n\n## ERP Solutions Providers\n\nSome familiar names are leaders in ERP software. Oracle Corp. ([ORCL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=orcl)) originally supplied a relational database that integrated with ERP software developed by SAP ([SAP](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=sap)) before entering the broader enterprise market in a big way in the early 2000s. Microsoft ([MSFT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=msft)) has long been an industry leader, with many customers using multiple software applications from the company.\n\nAs cloud-based solutions have grown in popularity in recent years, the traditional ERP industry leaders have seen challenges from upstarts such as Bizowie and WorkWise.\n\n## Examples of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n\nMen's grooming product maker Fulton & Roark successfully implemented enterprise resource planning to better track inventory and financial data. The North Carolina company, like many other businesses, used spreadsheets to track inventory and accounting software to record financial data.1﻿\n\nAs the company grew, its processes lagged behind. Their antiquated inventory tracking system did not account for changing costs, and the accounting software could not record metrics needed for key financial statements. These breakdowns created manual processes, which further compromised time and resources.\n\nTo eliminate unnecessary processes and centralize work, they chose the Oracle Netsuite ERP system. Immediately, Fulton & Rourk was better able to identify accounting errors related to inventory, eliminate costs from employing third-parties to evaluate their financial records, and better report financial positions.\n\nCadbury, global confectioner and maker of the popular chocolate Cadbury egg, also successfully implemented an ERP system. It operated thousands of systems that could not keep pace with its rapid growth, as well as used ineffective warehouse management systems. Previously, it implemented a failed SAP ERP system, which resulted in an overproduction of products.\n\nTrying its hand at enterprise resource planning again, it implemented a system that integrated its thousands of applications,2﻿ standardized processes across 16 locations, and restructured warehouse management systems—breaking down silos for a seamless, integrated coordination of work—to name a few.3﻿\n\nThere are many [case studies](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111214/lg-case-study-successful-enterprise-resource-planning-system.asp) that support the need for properly executed enterprise resource planning. The system should match the needs and goals of the company.\n\n## Enterprise Resource Planning FAQs\n\n### What Is an ERP and How Does It Work?\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) consists of technologies and systems companies use to manage and integrate their core business processes. Enterprise resource planning software offers single system solutions that integrate processes across the business. Such applications allow for users to interact within a single interface, share information, and enable cross-functional collaboration.\n\n### What Is an Example of an ERP?\n\nWith the explosion of the Internet of things (IoT), it's no secret that Internet-fueled or cloud-based applications are on the rise. As a result, more companies are moving away from on-site ERP systems to adopt the more agile, cloud-based ERP system, managed and maintained by the host or vendor. Oracle, widely known in the tech industry, offers several cloud-based ERP products used by many household brands, such as FedEx, Blue Cross, and Blue Shield.\n\n### What Are the Benefits of an ERP?\n\nAn ERP promotes the free flow of communication across an organization and results in increased synergies between different business areas, increased efficiencies as processes are streamlined and information is readily accessible to those that need it; and reduced costs associated with outdated and ineffective technology. Adopting an ERP may be a costly endeavor, but the return on investment (ROI) may be achieved quickly. Most certainly, the benefits realized (e.g., increased productivity and reduced administrative costs) may far outweigh the costs to introduce an ERP.\n\n### What Should an ERP System Include?\n\nThe components of an ERP system are dependent on the needs of the organization. However, there are key features that each ERP should include. An ERP system should be automated—to reduces errors—and flexible, allowing for modifications as the company changes or grows. More people are mobile; therefore, the ERP platform should allow users to access it from their mobile devices. Lastly, an ERP system should provide a means for productivity to be analyzed and measured. [Other tools](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110614/top-tools-erp-enterprise-resource-planning.asp) can be integrated within the system to improve a company's capabilities.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) manages and integrates business processes through a single system. With a better line of sight, companies are better able to plan and allocate resources. Without ERP, companies tend to operate in a siloed approach, with each department operating its own disconnected system.\n\nERP systems promote the free flow of communication and sharing of knowledge across an organization, the integration of systems for improved productivity and efficiencies, and increased synergies across teams and departments. However, moving to an ERP system will be counterproductive if the company's culture does not adjust with the change and the company does not review how the structure of its organization can support it.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvEQwpZNTdwhUsoBtxTuukc6aZFyBBpbxse2o_0e6Zwnlr_P-T7oLxFzlvLS8-fEm4zFGbN2Zi9IslkyEG7uzC2RkBKk1UgSvp30T95BFexsGuMdkREJcyClOy3lECkhjSQ49YrXbzAOjl17bnrLwX9K22gLm56ShmU1wszmDVSlowvTvPXKWtANgGE1xLHiUC64L1y3H9NZr8P47aWWhlTz9OQ6zUKCFPC_8yTI5cbK5Uo4tUHuFi94QB6nwSqPYjYqWuXUrpiD4q6Q9uxm03AkQp7d1UCjaagzM2CUj2fbdVVq3TQTk625qcHtfjICyh5WGq8Bti-6xfhiNc3&sig=Cg0ArKJSzL7JlVzuHcqXEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

{"id": "cWYSzBRzbqR14aGED1qNRRykFuyuMR-kfxxVoalewFQ", "title": "EndowmentEndowment", "body": "## What Is an Endowment?\n\nAn endowment is a donation of money or property to a [nonprofit organization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp), which uses the resulting investment income for a specific purpose. An endowment can also refer to the total of a nonprofit institution’s investable assets, also known as its “[principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp)” or “corpus,” which is meant to be used for operations or programs that are consistent with the wishes of the donor(s). Most endowments are designed to keep the principal amount intact while using the investment income for charitable efforts.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Most endowments are designed to keep the principal amount intact while using the investment income for charitable efforts.\n* Endowments tend to be organized as a trust, private foundation, or public charity.\n* Educational institutions, cultural institutions, and service-oriented organizations typically administer endowments.\n\n## Understanding Endowments\n\nEndowments are typically organized as a [trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp), [private foundation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatefoundation.asp), or public charity.23 Many endowments are administered by educational institutions, such as colleges and universities. Others are overseen by cultural institutions, such as art museums, libraries, religious organizations, private secondary schools, and service-oriented organizations, such as retirement homes or hospitals.4\n\nIn some cases a certain percent of an endowment’s assets are allowed to be used each year so the amount withdrawn from the endowment could be a combination of interest income and principal.5 The ratio of principal to income would change year to year based on prevailing market rates.\n\n## Policies of Endowments\n\nMost endowment funds have the following three components, which govern investments, withdrawals, and use of the funds. \n \n\n### Investment Policy\n\nThe investment policy lays out which types of investments a manager is permitted to make and dictates how aggressive the manager can be when seeking to meet return targets. Many endowment funds have specific investment policies built into their legal structure so that the pool of money must be managed for the long term.6\n\nEndowment funds of larger universities can have hundreds, if not thousands, of smaller funds that invest the pools of money in various securities or [asset classes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp). The funds typically have long-term investment goals, such as a specific rate of return or yield. As a result of the investment goals, the [asset allocation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp) (or types of investments within the fund) is designed to meet the long-term returns set forth in the fund’s objectives.6 \n \n\n### Withdrawal Policy\n\nThe withdrawal policy establishes the amount the organization or institution is permitted to take out from the fund at each period or installment. The withdrawal policy can be based on the needs of the organization and the amount of money in the fund. However, most endowments have an annual withdrawal limit. For example, an endowment might limit the withdrawals to 5% of the total amount in the fund. The reason the percentage of withdrawal is typically so low is that most university endowments are established to last forever and, therefore, have annual spending limits.7 \n \n\n### Usage Policy\n\nThe usage policy explains the purposes for which the fund can be used and also serves to ensure that all funding is adhering to these purposes and being used appropriately and effectively. Endowments, whether set up by an institution or given as a gift by donors, can have multiple uses. These include ensuring the financial health of specific departments, awarding scholarships or fellowships on the basis of merit to students, or providing assistance to students from a background of economic hardship.89\n\nChair positions or endowed professorships can be paid with the revenue from an endowment and free up capital that institutions can use to hire more faculty, reducing professor-to-student ratios. These chair positions are considered prestigious and are reserved for senior faculty.10\n\nEndowments can also be established for specific disciplines, departments, or programs within universities. Smith College, for example, has an endowment for its botanical gardens, and Harvard University has more than 14,000 separate endowment funds.1112 \n \n\n## Endowment Types\n\nThere are four different types of endowments:13\n\n* **Unrestricted Endowment** – This consists of assets that can be spent, saved, invested, and distributed at the discretion of the institution receiving the gift.\n* **Term Endowment** – This setup usually stipulates that, only after a period of time or a certain event, can the principal be expended.\n* **Quasi Endowment** – This is a donation made by an individual or institution and given with the intent of having that fund serve a specific purpose. The principal is typically retained, while the earnings are expended or distributed per specifications of the donor. These endowments are usually started by the institutions that benefit from them via internal transfers or by using unrestricted endowments already given to the institution.14\n* **Restricted Endowment** – This has its principal held in perpetuity, while the earnings from the invested assets are expended per the donor’s specifications.\n\nExcept in a few circumstances, the terms of endowments cannot be violated. If an institution is near bankruptcy or has declared it but still has assets in endowments, a court can issue a [cy pres doctrine](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cy-pres-doctrine.asp), allowing the institution to use those assets toward better financial health while still honoring the wishes of the donor as closely as possible.15\n\nDrawing down the corpus of the endowment to pay debts or operating expenses is known as “invading” or “endowment fund invasion,” and sometimes requires court approval.16\n\n## Requirements for Endowments\n\nManagers of endowments have to deal with the push and pull of interests to make use of assets to forward their causes or sustainably grow their respective foundation, institution, or university. The goal of any group given the task of managing a university’s endowments, for example, is to sustainably grow the funds by [reinvestment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestment.asp) of the endowment’s earnings while also contributing to the operating cost of the institution and its goals.\n\nManagement of an endowment is a discipline unto itself. An outline of considerations compiled by a leading management team includes setting objectives, developing a payout policy, building an asset allocation policy, selecting managers, managing risks systematically, cutting costs, and defining responsibilities.17\n\nPhilanthropies, or, more specifically, private nonoperating foundations, a category that includes the majority of grant-making foundations, are required by federal law to pay out 5% of their investment assets on their endowments every year for charitable purposes in order to keep their tax-exempt status.18 Private operating foundations must pay substantially all—85% or more—of their investment income.19 Community foundations have no requirement.20\n\nUnder the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/), substantially large university endowments must pay a tax of 1.4% on net investment income. This tax is levied on endowments held by private colleges and universities with at least 500 students and net assets of $500,000 per student.21\n\n## Endowments and Higher Education\n\nEndowments are [such an integral part of Western academic institutions](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-do-university-endowments-work/) that the size of a school’s endowment can be a fair measure of its well-being. They provide colleges and universities with the ability to fund their operating costs with sources other than tuition and ensure a level of stability by using them as a potential rainy-day fund.13 Older educational institutions, such as the Ivy League schools in the United States, have been particularly successful in building extremely robust endowment funds, having the advantages of continued donations from wealthy graduates and good fund management.22  \n \n\n### \n\n*Marcus Aurelius established the first recorded endowment, circa 176 AD, for the major schools of philosophy in Athens, Greece.23*\n\n## Criticism of Endowments\n\nHarvard and other elite higher educational institutions have come under criticism for the size of their endowments. Critics have questioned the utility of large, multibillion-dollar endowments, likening it to hoarding.24 Large endowments had been thought of as rainy-day funds for educational institutions, but during the [Great Recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp) many endowments cut their payouts. A 2014 study published in the American Economic Review looked closely at the incentives behind this behavior and found a trend toward an overemphasis on the health of an endowment rather than the institution as a whole.25\n\nIt’s not unusual for student activists to look with a critical eye at where their colleges and universities invest their endowments. In 1977 Hampshire College divested from South African investments in protest of apartheid, a move that a large number of educational institutions in the United States followed.26 Advocating for divestment from industries and countries that students find morally compromised is still prevalent among student activists, though the practice is evolving to improve efficacy, according to reporting by *The New Yorker*.27\n\nMore recently, three Ivy League universities with multibillion-dollar endowments—Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford—declined to accept millions they were set to receive as part of a $14 billion federal aid package for higher education included in the [CARES Act](https://www.investopedia.com/coronavirus-aid-relief-and-economic-security-cares-act-4800707), according to reporting by the New York Times.28 Indeed, Harvard University has now declined emergency COVID-19 relief money from the federal government three times, most recently $25.5 million from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan.29\n\n## Real World Examples of Endowments\n\nThe oldest endowments still active today were established by King Henry VIII and his relatives. His grandmother, Countess of Richmond,30 established endowed chairs in divinity at both Oxford and Cambridge, while Henry VIII established professorships in a variety of disciplines at Oxford and Cambridge.3132\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics article from 2020, the top 10 U.S. universities by endowment size at the end of the [fiscal year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp) 2020 were:22\n\n 1. Harvard University – $41,894,380,000\n 2. Yale University – $31,201,686,000\n 3. University of Texas System Office - $30,522,120,000\n 4. Stanford University – $28,948,111,000\n 5. Princeton University – $25,944,283,000\n 6. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – $18,381,518,000\n 7. University of Pennsylvania – $14,877,363,000\n 8. Texas A&M University – $12,720,530,000\n 9. University of Notre Dame (IN) – $12,319,422,000\n10. University of Michigan—Ann Arbor – $12,308,473,000\n\n### Harvard University Endowment\n\nHarvard officials had expected the endowment to shrink in 2020 due to [the impact of the pandemic on the economy and financial markets](https://www.investopedia.com/special-economic-impact-of-pandemics-4800597).33 They were wrong, though, as it returned 7.3% on its investments and actually increased a bit.34 Similar fears about 2021 proved even more unfounded. Powered by a rising stock market, the endowment returned a whopping 33.6% on its investments and grew by $11.3 billion to $53.2 billion.35 This made it the largest amount in the endowment’s history.36 And that is saying something, as, according to *The New York Times*, Harvard in 2020 was already “the most well-heeled university in the world.”3738\n\nThere are thousands of specific funds within the overall endowment fund for Harvard. The funds’ asset allocation was spread out through various types of investments, including:35\n\n* Equities: 14%\n* Hedge funds: 33%\n* Private equity investments: 34%\n* Real estate: 5%\n* Bonds: 4%\n\nThe endowment’s annual payout rate is typically capped. Harvard’s payout rate was 5.2% in 2021, which totaled $2.0 billion.39 Distributions provided 35% of total revenue for 2021, and another 10% of revenue came from current gifts of philanthropy. Cash gifts to the endowment totaled $541 million.38Approximately 70% of the annual distribution is restricted to specific departments, programs, or other purposes. In other words, the funds need to be spent according to the terms established by the donors. Only 30% of the fund can be used by Harvard for flexible spending.40\n\nIn 2021 Harvard paid nearly $161 million from the endowment to undergraduates for scholarships.41 Approximately 55% of the students receive need-based scholarships and pay, on average, $12,700 per year to attend Harvard.

{"id": "IWhOMu3E5I8LYpJ1-Ch0tiR-AGrIzhI60YEUEdKg-Nk", "title": "Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)", "body": "## What Is an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)?\n\nAn employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is an employee benefit plan that gives workers ownership interest in the company; this interest takes the form of shares of stock. ESOPs give the sponsoring company—the selling [shareholder](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp)—and participants various tax benefits, making them qualified plans. Employers often use ESOPs as a [corporate-finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatefinance.asp) strategy to align the interests of their employees with those of their shareholders.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) gives workers ownership interest in the company.\n* An ESOP is usually formed to allow employees the opportunity to buy stock in a closely held company to facilitate succession planning.\n* ESOPs encourage employees to do what's best for shareholders since the employees themselves own stock.\n* ESOPs provide companies with tax benefits, thus incentivizing owners to offer them to employees.\n* Companies typically tie distributions from the plan to vesting.\n\n## Understanding Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP)\n\nAn ESOP is usually formed to facilitate succession planning in a closely held company by allowing employees the opportunity to buy shares of the corporate stock. ESOPs are set up as trust funds and can be funded by companies putting newly issued shares into them, putting cash in to buy existing company shares, or borrowing money through the entity to buy company shares. ESOPs are used by companies of all sizes, including a number of large publicly traded corporations.\n\nSince ESOP shares are part of the employees' remuneration package, companies can use ESOPs to keep plan participants focused on corporate performance and share price appreciation. By giving plan participants an interest in seeing the company's stock perform well, these plans supposedly encourage participants to do what's best for shareholders, since the participants themselves are shareholders.\n\n### Upfront Costs and Distributions\n\nCompanies often provide employees with such ownership with no upfront costs. The company may hold the provided shares in a trust for safety and growth until the employee retires or resigns. Companies typically tie distributions from the plan to [vesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp), which gives employees rights to employer-provided assets over time; typically, they earn an increasing proportion of shares for each year of their service.\n\nWhen a fully vested employee retires or resigns from the company, the firm \"purchases\" the vested shares back from them. The money goes to the employee in a lump sum or equal periodic payments, depending on the plan. Once the company purchases the shares and pays the employee, the company redistributes or voids the shares. Employees who leave the company voluntarily cannot take the shares of stock with them, only the cash payment.\n\nFired employees often only qualify for the amount they have vested in the ESOP.\n\nEmployee-owned corporations are companies with majority holdings held by their own employees. These organizations are like cooperatives, except that the company does not distribute its capital equally. Many of these companies only provide voting rights to particular shareholders. Companies may also give senior employees the benefit of more shares compared to new employees.\n\n## ESOP and Other Forms of Employee Ownership\n\nStock ownership plans provide packages that act as additional benefits for employees to prevent hostility and keep a specific corporate culture that company managements want to maintain.\n\nOther versions of employee ownership include direct-purchase programs, stock options, [restricted stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp), phantom stock, and stock appreciation rights. Direct-purchase plans let employees purchase shares of their respective companies with their personal after-tax money. Some countries provide special tax-qualified plans that let employees purchase company stock at discounted prices. \n\n### Restricted Stock, Stock Options, and Phantom Stock\n\nRestricted stock gives the employees the right to receive shares as a gift or a purchased item after meeting particular restrictions, such as working for a specific period or hitting specific performance targets. Stock options provide employees with the opportunity to buy shares at a fixed price for a set period, while phantom stock provides [cash bonuses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-bonus.asp) for good employee performance.\n\nThese bonuses equate to the value of a particular number of shares. Stock appreciation rights give employees the right to raise the value of an assigned number of shares. Companies usually pay these shares in cash.\n\n## What Does ESOP Stand for?\n\nESOP stands for employee stock ownership plan. An ESOP grants employees company stock, often based on the duration of their employment. Typically, it is part of a compensation package, where shares will vest over a period of time. ESOPs are designed so that employees' motivations and interests are aligned with those of the company's shareholders. From a management perspective, ESOPs have certain tax advantages, along with incentivizing employees to focus on company performance.\n\n## How Does an Employee Stock Ownership Plan Work?\n\nFirst, an employee stock ownership plan is set up as a trust fund. Here, companies may place newly issued shares, borrow money to buy company shares, or fund the trust with cash to purchase company shares. Meanwhile, employees can accumulate a growing number of shares, an amount that can rise over time depending on their employment term. These shares are meant to be sold only at or after the time of retirement or termination, and the employee is remunerated the cash value of their shares.\n\n## What Is an Example of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan?\n\nConsider an employee who has worked at a large tech firm for five years. Under the company’s employee stock ownership plan, they have the right to receive 20 shares after the first year, and 100 shares total after five years. When the employee retires, they will receive the share value in cash. Stock ownership plans may include stock options, restricted shares, and stock appreciation rights, among others. \n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\n\nPut your trading skills to the test with our [FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssRRBCCer8ZJ8qo7fUY5m4AzMGybnclNo0PTnrbZayRUVpVal-XzgfAQ3P3sPgTkOu_TdqaYYiB73yfKXqPGlI5L_rKuWe5A46GxopiN6RW2LcsuD6jk6oU4KPFMW4rQWtmd-oH-x3ynMT_hwY_9YhRy0c-9-fR7MHgT1QV_OzhxiQnbYxVwiYCoCoe6UKnBFl6_tLSk_QI_KjgwjCMC_FjmI-7a2QBxMcm0ij3hcDZd00r9up8aNKoPGw5F92S-pk7I9RqdYWgCFo5L-umWbBukHZyF6iNqyIoEzsysdj221OmykoNII-vX4Z9JX16lButex35y0bDXxNY120pxUak69UhgA&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKu2orpUwiobEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim&subid=dfp-ros-sim) Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!

EV includes in its calculation the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt as well as any cash on the company's balance sheet. Enterprise value is a popular metric used to value a company for a potential takeover.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nEnterprise value (EV) is a measure of a company's total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalization.\nEnterprise value includes in its calculation the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt as well as any cash on the company's balance sheet.\nEnterprise value is used as the basis for many financial ratios that measure the performance of a company.\n2:01\nIntroduction To Enterprise Value\nFormula and Calculation for Enterprise Value (EV)\n\\\\begin{aligned} &EV=MC+Total\\~Debt-C\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &MC=\\\\text{\\\\small Market capitalization; equal to the current stock}\\\\ &\\\\text{\\\\small price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares}\\\\ &Total\\~debt =\\\\text{\\\\small Equal to the sum of short-term and}\\\\ &\\\\text{\\\\small long-term debt}\\\\ &C=\\\\text{\\\\small Cash and cash equivalents; the liquid assets of}\\\\ &\\\\text{\\\\small a company, but may not include marketable securities}\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}\n​\n\nEV=MC+Total Debt−C\nwhere:\nMC=Market capitalization; equal to the current stock\nprice multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares\nTotal debt=Equal to the sum of short-term and\nlong-term debt\nC=Cash and cash equivalents; the liquid assets of\na company, but may not include marketable securities\n​\n\nTo calculate the market capitalization if not readily available you would multiply the number of outstanding shares by the current stock price. Next, total all debt on the company's balance sheet including both short-term and long-term debt. Finally, add the market capitalization to the total debt and subtract any cash and cash equivalents from the result.\n\nWhat Does EV Tell You?\nEnterprise value (EV) could be thought of like the theoretical takeover price if a company were to be bought. EV differs significantly from simple market capitalization in several ways, and many consider it to be a more accurate representation of a firm's value. The value of a firm's debt, for example, would need to be paid off by the buyer when taking over a company. As a result, enterprise value provides a much more accurate takeover valuation because it includes debt in its value calculation.\n\nWhy doesn't market capitalization properly represent a firm's value? It leaves a lot of important factors out, such as a company's debt on the one hand and its cash reserves on the other. Enterprise value is basically a modification of market cap, as it incorporates debt and cash for determining a company's valuation.\n\nMarket capitalization is not intended to represent a company's book value. Instead, it represents a company's value as determined by market participants.\nEV as a Valuation Multiple\nEnterprise value is used as the basis for many financial ratios that measure the performance of a company. An enterprise multiple that contains enterprise value relates the total value of a company as reflected in the market value of its capital from all sources to a measure of operating earnings generated, such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nEBITDA is a measure of a company's ability to generate revenue and is used as an alternative to simple earnings or net income in some circumstances. EBITDA, however, can be misleading because it strips out the cost of capital investments like property, plant, and equipment. Another figure, EBIT, can be used as a similar financial metric without the drawback of removing depreciation and amortization expenses related to property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). EBITDA is calculated using the following formula:\n\nEBITDA = recurring earnings from continuing operations + interest + taxes + depreciation + amortization\nThe enterprise value/EBITDA metric is used as a valuation tool to compare the value of a company, debt included, to the company’s cash earnings less non-cash expenses. It's ideal for analysts and investors looking to compare companies within the same industry.\n\nEV/EBITDA is useful in a number of situations:\n\nThe ratio may be more useful than the P/E ratio when comparing firms with different degrees of financial leverage (DFL).\nEBITDA is useful for valuing capital-intensive businesses with high levels of depreciation and amortization.\nEBITDA is usually positive even when earnings per share (EPS) is not.\nEV/EBITDA also has a number of drawbacks, however:\n\nIf working capital is growing, EBITDA will overstate cash flows from operations (CFO or OCF). Further, this measure ignores how different revenue recognition policies can affect a company's OCF.\nBecause free cash flow to the firm captures the number of capital expenditures (CapEx), it is more strongly linked with valuation theory than EBITDA. EBITDA will be a generally adequate measure if capital expenses equal depreciation expenses.\nAnother commonly used multiple for determining the relative value of firms is the enterprise value to sales ratio or EV/sales. EV/sales is regarded as a more accurate measure than the price/sales ratio since it takes into account the value and amount of debt a company must repay at some point.\n\nGenerally, the lower the EV/sales multiple, the more attractive or undervalued the company is believed to be valued. The EV/sales ratio can actually be negative at times when the cash held by a company is more than the market capitalization and debt value, implying that the company can essentially be by itself with its own cash.\n\nP/E Ratio vs. EV\nThe price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple. The P/E ratio doesn't consider the amount of debt that a company has on its balance sheet.\n\nHowever, EV includes debt when valuing a company and is often used in tandem with the P/E ratio to achieve a comprehensive valuation.\n\nLimitations of Using EV\nAs stated earlier, EV includes total debt, but it's important to consider how the debt is being utilized by the company's management. For example, capital-intensive industries such as the oil and gas industry typically carry significant amounts of debt, which is used to foster growth. The debt could be used to purchase plant and equipment. As a result, the EV would be skewed for companies with a large amount of debt as compared to industries with little or no debt.\n\nAs with any financial metric, it's best to compare companies within the same industry to get a better sense of how the company is valued relative to its peers.\n\nExample of EV\nAs stated earlier, the formula for EV is essentially the sum of the market value of equity (market capitalization) and the market value of debt of a company, less any cash. The market capitalization of a company is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. The net debt is the market value of debt minus cash. A company acquiring another company keeps the cash of the target firm, which is why cash needs to be deducted from the firm's price as represented by the market cap.\n\nLet's calculate the enterprise value for Macy's (M). For its 2020 fiscal year, Macy's recorded the following:\n\nMacy's Data Pulled from 2020 10-K Statement\n1\t# Outstanding Shares\t308.5 million\t\n2\tShare Price close on 1/29/21\t$20.22\t\n3\tMarket Capitalization\t$7.79 billion\tItem 1 x 2\n4\tShort-Term Debt\t$452 million\t\n5\tLong-Term Debt \t$4.41 billion\t\n6\tTotal Debt\t$4.86 billion\tItem 4+ 5\n7\tCash and Cash Equivalents\t$1.58 billion\t\nEnterprise Value\t$8.086 billion\tItem 3 + 6 - 7\nWe can calculate Macy's market cap from the information above. Macy's has 308.5 million outstanding shares valued at $20.22 per share:1\n\nMacy's market capitalization was $7.79 billion (308.5 million x $20.22).\nMacy's had short-term debt of $452 million and long-term debt of $4.41 billion for a total debt of $4.86 billion.\nMacy's had $1.58 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nMacy's enterprise value is calculated as $4.806 billion (market cap) + $4.86 billion (debt) - $1.58 billion (cash).\nMacy's EV = $8.086 billion\nEnterprise value is considered comprehensive when valuing a company because, if a company were to purchase Macy's outstanding shares for $4.8 billion, it would also have to settle Macy's outstanding debts.\n\nIn total, the acquiring company will spend closer to $10 billion to purchase Macy's. However, since Macy's has $1.3 billion in cash, this amount can be added to repay the debt.\n\nWhat Is Enterprise Value and How Does It Differ From Market Capitalization?\nEnterprise value is a popular measurement of the total value of a company. It can be seen as the theoretical price that would need to be paid in order to fully acquire a company in a going-private transaction. Unlike market capitalization, which reflects only the value of the company’s equity, enterprise value reflects the size of the company’s debts as well as its cash reserves. It is a popular figure among investors and analysts and is often used in financial ratios.\n\nWhy Is Cash Deducted From Enterprise Value?\nTo understand why cash is deducted from enterprise value, suppose that you are a private investor wishing to purchase 100% of a publicly-traded company. When planning your purchase, you note that the company’s market capitalization is $100 million, meaning you will need $100 million to buy all the shares from its existing shareholders. But what if the company also has $20 million in cash? In that scenario, your real “cost” for purchasing the company would only be $80 million, since buying the company would immediately give you access to its $20 million in cash. All else being equal, a higher cash balance leads to a lower enterprise value, and vice-versa.\n\nWhy Is Debt Added to Enterprise Value?\nHigher debt leads to a higher enterprise value because it represents an added cost that must be paid by any would-be acquirer. For instance, in our previous example, suppose that the company has $10 million in debt. With that in mind, you now know that in addition to the $100 million you need to purchase the shares from its existing shareholders, you also need an additional $10 million to pay off the company’s debts. Putting these figures together, your total enterprise value would be $100 million in market capitalization, plus $10 million in debt, minus $20 million in cash, for a total of $90 million.\n\nCorrection—March 12, 2022: A previous version of this article quoted incorrect numbers from the Macy's 10-K filing.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can choose from 183,000 online video courses.

{"id": "F5sWJYQ3uW54-YneOe0As2SE5aTlIdVPE_jcwy5RKGg", "title": "Entrepreneur\n", "body": "What Is an Entrepreneur?\nAn entrepreneur is an individual who creates a new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards. The process of setting up a business is known as entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator, a source of new ideas, goods, services, and business/or procedures.\n\nEntrepreneurs play a key role in any economy, using the skills and initiative necessary to anticipate needs and bringing good new ideas to market. Entrepreneurship that proves to be successful in taking on the risks of creating a startup is rewarded with profits, fame, and continued growth opportunities. Entrepreneurship that fails results in losses and less prevalence in the markets for those involved.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nA person who undertakes the risk of starting a new business venture is called an entrepreneur.\nAn entrepreneur creates a firm to realize their idea, known as entrepreneurship, which aggregates capital and labor in order to produce goods or services for profit.\nEntrepreneurship is highly risky but also can be highly rewarding, as it serves to generate economic wealth, growth, and innovation.\nEnsuring funding is key for entrepreneurs: Financing resources include SBA loans and crowdfunding.\nThe way entrepreneurs file and pay taxes will depend on how the business is set up in terms of structure.\n1:37\nEntrepreneur\nHow Entrepreneurship Works\nEntrepreneurship is one of the resources economists categorize as integral to production, the other three being land/natural resources, labor, and capital. An entrepreneur combines the first three of these to manufacture goods or provide services. They typically create a business plan, hire labor, acquire resources and financing, and provide leadership and management for the business.\n\nEntrepreneurs commonly face many obstacles when building their companies. The three that many of them cite as the most challenging are as follows:\n\nOvercoming bureaucracy\nHiring talent\nObtaining financing\nEconomists have never had a consistent definition of \"entrepreneur\" or \"entrepreneurship\" (the word \"entrepreneur\" comes from the French verb entreprendre, meaning \"to undertake\"). Though the concept of an entrepreneur existed and was known for centuries, the classical and neoclassical economists left entrepreneurs out of their formal models: They assumed that perfect information would be known to fully rational actors, leaving no room for risk-taking or discovery. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that economists seriously attempted to incorporate entrepreneurship into their models.\n\nThree thinkers were central to the inclusion of entrepreneurs: Joseph Schumpeter, Frank Knight, and Israel Kirzner. Schumpeter suggested that entrepreneurs—not just companies—were responsible for the creation of new things in the search for profit. Knight focused on entrepreneurs as the bearers of uncertainty and believed they were responsible for risk premiums in financial markets. Kirzner thought of entrepreneurship as a process that led to the discovery.\n\nHow to Become an Entrepreneur\nAfter retiring her professional dancing shoes, Judi Sheppard Missett became an entrepreneur by teaching a dance class to civilians in order to earn some extra cash. But she soon learned that women who came to her studio were less interested in learning precise steps than they were in losing weight and toning up. Sheppard Missett then trained instructors to teach her routines to the masses, and Jazzercise was born. A franchise deal followed. Today, the company has more than 8,300 locations worldwide.1\n\nFollowing an ice cream making correspondence course, two entrepreneurs, Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen paired $8,000 in savings with a $4,000 loan, leased a Burlington, Vt., gas station, and purchased equipment to create uniquely flavored ice cream for the local market.2 Today, Ben & Jerry’s hauls in millions in annual revenue.\n\nAlthough the self-made person has always been a popular figure in American society, entrepreneurship has gotten greatly romanticized in the last few decades. In the 21st century, the example of Internet companies like Alphabet, formerly Google (GOOG), and Meta (FB), formerly Facebook, both of which have made their founders wildly wealthy, have made people enamored with the idea of becoming entrepreneurs.\n\nUnlike traditional professions, where there is often a defined path to follow, the road to entrepreneurship is mystifying to most. What works for one entrepreneur might not work for the next and vice versa. That said, there are seven general steps that most, if not all, successful entrepreneurs have followed:\n\nEnsure Financial Stability\nThis first step is not a strict requirement but is definitely recommended. While entrepreneurs have built successful businesses while being less than financially flush (think of Facebook, now Meta, founder Mark Zuckerberg as a college student), starting out with an adequate cash supply and ensuring ongoing funding can only help an aspiring entrepreneur, increasing their personal runway and giving them more time to work on building a successful business, rather than worrying about making quick money.\n\nBuild a Diverse Skill Set\nOnce a person has strong finances, it is important to build a diverse set of skills and then apply those skills in the real world. The beauty of step two is it can be done concurrently with step one.\n\nBuilding a skill set can be achieved through learning and trying new tasks in real-world settings. For example, if an aspiring entrepreneur has a background in finance, they can move into a sales role at their existing company to learn the soft skills necessary to be successful. Once a diverse skill set is built, it gives an entrepreneur a toolkit that they can rely on when they are faced with the inevitability of tough situations.\n\nMuch has been discussed about if going to college is necessary to become a successful entrepreneur. Many famous entrepreneurs are famous for having dropped out of college: Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry Ellison, to name a few.\n\nThough going to college isn't necessary to build a successful business, it can teach young individuals a lot about the world in many other ways. And these famous college dropouts are the exception rather than the norm. College may not be for everyone and the choice is personal, but it is something to think about, especially with the high price tag of a college education in the U.S.\n\nIt is not true that majoring in entrepreneurship is necessary to start a business. People that have built successful businesses have majored in many different subjects and doing so can open your eyes to a different way of thinking that can help you in establishing your business.\n\nConsume Content Across Multiple Channels\nAs important as building a diverse skill set is, the need to consume a diverse array of content is equally so. This content can be in the form of podcasts, books, articles, or lectures. The important thing is that the content, no matter the channel, should be varied in what it covers. An aspiring entrepreneur should always familiarize themself with the world around them so they can look at industries with a fresh perspective, giving them the ability to build a business around a specific sector.\n\nIdentify a Problem to Solve\nThrough the consumption of content across multiple channels, an aspiring entrepreneur is able to identify various problems to solve. One business adage dictates that a company's product or service needs to solve a specific pain point; either for another business or for a consumer group. Through the identification of a problem, an aspiring entrepreneur is able to build a business around solving that problem.\n\nIt is important to combine steps three and four so it is possible to identify a problem to solve by looking at various industries as an outsider. This often provides an aspiring entrepreneur with the ability to see a problem others might not.\n\nSolve That Problem\nSuccessful startups solve a specific pain point for other companies or for the public. This is known as \"adding value within the problem.\" Only through adding value to a specific problem or pain point does an entrepreneur become successful.\n\nSay, for example, you identify the process for making a dentist appointment is complicated for patients, and dentists are losing customers as a result. The value could be to build an online appointment system that makes it easier to book appointments.\n\nNetwork Like Crazy\nMost entrepreneurs can't do it alone. The business world is a cutthroat one and getting any help you can will always help and reduce the time it takes to achieve a successful business. Networking is critical for any new entrepreneur. Meeting the right people that can introduce you to contacts in your industry, such as the right suppliers, financiers, and even mentors can be the difference between success and failure.\n\nAttending conferences, emailing and calling people in the industry, speaking to your cousin's friend's brother who is in a similar business, will help you get out into the world and discover people that can guide you. Once you have your foot in the door with the right people, conducting a business becomes a lot easier.\n\nLead by Example\nEvery entrepreneur needs to be a leader within their company. Simply doing the day-to-day requirements will not lead to success. A leader needs to work hard, motivate, and inspire their employees to reach their best potential, which will lead to the success of the company.\n\nLook at some of the greatest and most successful companies; all of them have had great leaders. Apple and Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Microsoft, Bob Iger and Disney, and so on. Study these people and read their books to see how to be a great leader and become the leader that your employees can follow by the example you set.\n\nEntrepreneurship Financing\nGiven the riskiness of a new venture, the acquisition of capital funding is particularly challenging, and many entrepreneurs deal with it via bootstrapping: financing a business using methods such as using their own money, providing sweat equity to reduce labor costs, minimizing inventory, and factoring receivables.\n\nWhile some entrepreneurs are lone players struggling to get small businesses off the ground on a shoestring, others take on partners armed with greater access to capital and other resources. In these situations, new firms may acquire financing from venture capitalists, angel investors, hedge funds, crowdfunding, or through more traditional sources such as bank loans.\n\nResources for Entrepreneurs\nThere are a variety of financing resources for entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. Obtaining a small business loan through the Small Business Administration (SBA) can help entrepreneurs get the business off the ground with affordable loans. SBA helps connect businesses to loan providers.\n\nIf entrepreneurs are willing to give up a piece of equity in their business, then they may find financing in the form of angel investors and venture capitalists. These types of investors also provide guidance, mentorship, and connections in addition to just capital.\n\nCrowdfunding has also become a popular way for entrepreneurs to raise capital, particularly through Kickstarter. An entrepreneur creates a page for their product and a monetary goal to reach while promising certain givebacks to those who donate, such as products or experiences.\n\nBootstrapping for Entrepreneurs\nBootstrapping refers to building a company solely from your savings as an entrepreneur as well as from the initial sales made from your business. This is a difficult process as all the financial risk is placed on the entrepreneur and there is little room for error. If the business fails, the entrepreneur also may lose all of their life savings.\n\nThe advantage of bootstrapping is that an entrepreneur can run the business with their own vision and no outside interference or investors demanding quick profits. That being said, sometimes having an outsider's assistance can help a business rather than hurt it. Many companies have succeeded with the bootstrapping strategy, but it is a difficult path.\n\nSmall Business vs. Entrepreneurship\nA small business and entrepreneurship have a lot in common but they are different. A small business is a company, usually, a sole-proprietorship or partnership, that is not a medium-sized or large-sized business, operates locally, and does not have access to a vast amount of resources or capital.\n\nEntrepreneurship refers to an individual that has an idea and intends to execute on that idea, usually to disrupt the current market with a new product or service. Entrepreneurship usually starts as a small business but the long-term vision is much greater, to seek high profits and capture market share with an innovative new idea.\n\nHow Entrepreneurs Make Money\nEntrepreneurs make money like any business: they seek to generate revenues that are greater than costs. Increasing revenues is the goal and that can be achieved through marketing, word-of-mouth, and networking. Keeping costs low is also critical as it results in higher profit margins. This can be achieved through efficient operations and eventually economies of scale.\n\nTaxes for Entrepreneurs\nThe taxes you will pay as an entrepreneur will depend on how you set up your business in terms of structure.\n\nSole Proprietorship: A business set up this way is an extension of the individual. Business income and expenses are filed on Schedule C on your personal tax return and you are taxed at your individual tax rate.3\n\nPartnership: For tax purposes, a partnership functions the same way as a sole proprietorship, with the only difference being that income and expenses are split amongst the partners.\n\nThere are many benefits entrepreneurs can achieve through taxes, such as deducting their home office and utilities, mileage for business travel, advertising, and travel expenses.4\nC-Corporation: A C-corporation is a separate legal entity and has separate taxes filed with the IRS from the entrepreneur. The business income will be taxed at the corporate tax rate rather than the personal income tax rate.5\n\nLimited Liability Company (LLC) or S-Corporation: These two options are taxed in the same manner as a C-corporation but usually at lower amounts.6\n\n7 Characteristics of Entrepreneurs\nWhat else do entrepreneurial success stories have in common? They invariably involve industrious people diving into things they’re naturally passionate about.\n\nGiving credence to the adage, “find a way to get paid for the job you’d do for free,” passion is arguably the most important component startup business owners must have, and every edge helps.\n\nWhile the prospect of becoming your own boss and raking in a fortune is alluring to entrepreneurial dreamers, the possible downside to hanging one’s own shingle is vast. Income isn’t guaranteed, employer-sponsored benefits go by the wayside, and when your business loses money, your personal assets can take a hit; not just a corporation’s bottom line. But adhering to a few tried and true principles can go a long way in diffusing risk. The following are a few characteristics required to be a successful entrepreneur.\n\n1. Versatile\n   When starting out, it’s essential to personally handle sales and other customer interactions whenever possible. Direct client contact is the clearest path to obtaining honest feedback about what the target market likes and what you could be doing better. If it’s not always practical to be the sole customer interface, entrepreneurs should train employees to invite customer comments as a matter of course. Not only does this make customers feel empowered, but happier clients are more likely to recommend businesses to others.\n\nPersonally answering phones is one of the most significant competitive edges home-based entrepreneurs hold over their larger competitors. In a time of high-tech backlash, where customers are frustrated with automated responses and touch-tone menus, hearing a human voice is one surefire way to entice new customers and make existing ones feel appreciated; an important fact, given that some 80% of all business is generated from repeat customers.\n\nParadoxically, while customers value high-touch telephone access, they also expect a highly polished website. Even if your business isn’t in a high-tech industry, entrepreneurs still must exploit internet technology to get their message across. A startup garage-based business can have a superior website than an established $100 million company. Just make sure a live human being is on the other end of the phone number listed.\n\n1. Flexible\n   Few successful business owners find perfect formulas straight out of the gate. On the contrary: ideas must morph over time. Whether tweaking product design or altering food items on a menu, finding the perfect sweet spot takes trial and error.\n\nFormer Starbucks Chair and CEO Howard Schultz initially thought playing Italian opera music over store speakers would accentuate the Italian coffeehouse experience he was attempting to replicate. But customers saw things differently and didn’t seem to like arias with their espressos. As a result, Schultz jettisoned the opera and introduced comfortable chairs instead.\n\n1. Money Savvy\n   Through the heart of any successful new business, a venture beats the lifeblood of steady cash flow, which is essential for purchasing inventory, paying rent, maintaining equipment, and promoting the business. The key to staying in the black is rigorous bookkeeping of income versus expenses. And since most new businesses don’t make a profit within the first year, by setting money aside for this contingency, entrepreneurs can help mitigate the risk of falling short of funds. Related to this, it’s essential to keep personal and business costs separate, and never dip into business funds to cover the costs of daily living.\n\nOf course, it’s important to pay yourself a realistic salary that allows you to cover essentials, but not much more; especially where investors are involved. Of course, such sacrifices can strain relationships with loved ones who may need to adjust to lower standards of living and endure worry over risking family assets. For this reason, entrepreneurs should communicate these issues well ahead of time, and make sure significant loved ones are spiritually on board.\n\n1. Resilient\n   Running your own business is extremely difficult, especially getting one started from scratch. It requires a lot of time, dedication, and failure. A successful entrepreneur must show resilience to all the difficulties on the road ahead. Whenever they meet with failure or rejection they must keep pushing forward.\n\nStarting your business is a learning process and any learning process comes with a learning curve, which can be frustrating, especially when money is on the line. It's important never to give up through the difficult times if you want to succeed.\n\n1. Focused\n   Similar to resilience, a successful entrepreneur must stay focused and eliminate the noise and doubts that come with running a business. Becoming sidetracked, not believing in your instincts and ideas, and losing sight of the end goal is a recipe for failure. A successful entrepreneur must always remember why they started the business and remain on course to see it through.\n2. Business Smart\n   Knowing how to manage money and understanding financial statements are critical for anyone running their own business. Knowing your revenues, your costs, and how to increase or decrease them, respectively, is important. Making sure you don't burn through cash will allow you to keep the business alive.\n\nImplementing a sound business strategy, knowing your target market, your competitors, your strengths and weaknesses, will allow you to maneuver the difficult landscape of running your business.\n\n1. Communicators\n   Successful communication is important in almost every facet of life, regardless of what you do. It is also of the utmost importance in running a business. From conveying your ideas and strategies to potential investors to sharing your business plan with your employees to negotiating contracts with suppliers all require successful communication.\n\nTypes of Entrepreneurs\nNot every entrepreneur is the same and not all have the same goals. Here are a few types of entrepreneurs:\n\nBuilder\nBuilders seek to create scalable businesses within a short time frame. Builders typically pass $5 million in revenue in the first two to four years and continue to build up until $100 million or beyond. These individuals seek to build out a strong infrastructure by hiring the best talent and seeking the best investors. They have temperamental personalities that are suited to the fast growth they desire but can make personal and business relationships difficult.7\n\nOpportunist\nOpportunistic entrepreneurs are optimistic individuals with the ability to pick out financial opportunities, getting in at the right time, staying on board during the time of growth, and exiting when a business hits its peak.\n\nThese types of entrepreneurs are concerned with profits and the wealth they will build, so they are attracted to ideas where they can create residual or renewal income. Because they are looking to find well-timed opportunities, opportunistic entrepreneurs can be impulsive.7\n\nInnovator\nInnovators are those rare individuals that come up with a great idea or product that no one has thought of before. Think of Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg. These individuals worked on what they loved and found business opportunities through that.\n\nRather than focusing on money, innovators care more about the impact that their products and services have on society. These individuals are not the best at running a business as they are idea-generating individuals, so often they leave the day-to-day operations to those more capable in that respect.7\n\nSpecialist\nThese individuals are analytical and risk-averse. They have a strong skill set in a specific area obtained through education or apprenticeship. A specialist entrepreneur will build out their business through networking and referrals, resulting in slower growth than a builder entrepreneur.7\n\n4 Types of Entrepreneurship\nAs there are different types of entrepreneurs, there are also different types of businesses they create. Below are the main different types of entrepreneurship.\n\nSmall Business Entrepreneurship\nSmall business entrepreneurship is the idea of opening a business without turning it into a large conglomerate or opening many chains. A single-location restaurant, one grocery shop, or a retail shop to sell your handmade goods would all be an example of small business entrepreneurship.\n\nThese individuals usually invest their own money and succeed if their business turns a profit, which they live off of. They don't have outside investors and will only take a loan if it helps continue the business.\n\nScalable Startup\nThese are companies that start with a unique idea; think Silicon Valley. The hopes are to innovate with a unique product or service and continue growing the company, continuously scaling up as time moves on. These types of companies often require investors and large amounts of capital to grow their idea and reach multiple markets.\n\nLarge Company\nLarge company entrepreneurship is a new business division created within an existing company. The existing company may be well placed to branch out into other sectors or it may be well placed to become involved in new technology.\n\nCEOs of these companies either foresee a new market for the company or individuals within the company generate ideas that they bring to senior management to start the process.\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship\nThe goal of social entrepreneurship is to create a benefit to society and humankind. They focus on helping communities or the environment through their products and services. They are not driven by profits but rather by helping the world around them.\n\nEntrepreneurs and the Economy\nIn economist-speak, an entrepreneur acts as a coordinating agent in a capitalist economy. This coordination takes the form of resources being diverted toward new potential profit opportunities. The entrepreneur moves various resources, both tangible and intangible, promoting capital formation.\n\nAs of 2021, there are 32.5 million small businesses in the United States.8\n\nIn a market full of uncertainty, it is the entrepreneur who can actually help clear up uncertainty, as they make judgments or assume the risk. To the extent that capitalism is a dynamic profit-and-loss system, entrepreneurs drive efficient discovery and consistently reveal knowledge.\n\nEstablished firms face increased competition and challenges from entrepreneurs, which often spurs them toward research and development efforts as well. In technical economic terms, the entrepreneur disrupts the course toward steady-state equilibrium.\n\nHow Entrepreneurship Helps Economies\nNurturing entrepreneurship can have a positive impact on an economy and a society in several ways. For starters, entrepreneurs create new businesses. They invent goods and services, resulting in employment, and often create a ripple effect, resulting in more and more development. For example, after a few information technology companies began in India in the 1990s, businesses in associated industries, like call center operations and hardware providers, began to develop too, offering support services and products.\n\nEntrepreneurs add to the gross national income. Existing businesses may remain confined to their markets and eventually hit an income ceiling. But new products or technologies create new markets and new wealth. And increased employment and higher earnings contribute to a nation’s tax base, enabling greater government spending on public projects.\n\nEntrepreneurs create social change. They break tradition with unique inventions that reduce dependence on existing methods and systems, sometimes rendering them obsolete. Smartphones and their apps, for example, have revolutionized work and play across the globe.\n\nEntrepreneurs invest in community projects and help charities and other non-profit organizations, supporting causes beyond their own. Bill Gates, for example, has used his considerable wealth for education and public health initiatives.\n\nEntrepreneurial Ecosystems\nThere is research that shows high levels of self-employment can stall economic development: Entrepreneurship, if not properly regulated, can lead to unfair market practices and corruption, and too many entrepreneurs can create income inequalities in society. Overall, though, entrepreneurship is a critical driver of innovation and economic growth. Therefore, fostering entrepreneurship is an important part of the economic growth strategies of many local and national governments around the world.\n\nTo this end, governments commonly assist in the development of entrepreneurial ecosystems, which may include entrepreneurs themselves, government-sponsored assistance programs, and venture capitalists. They may also include non-government organizations, such as entrepreneurs' associations, business incubators, and education programs.\n\nFor example, California's Silicon Valley is often cited as an example of a well-functioning entrepreneurial ecosystem. The region has a well-developed venture capital base, a large pool of well-educated talent, especially in technical fields, and a wide range of government and non-government programs fostering new ventures and providing information and support to entrepreneurs.\n\nQuestions for Entrepreneurs\nEmbarking on the entrepreneurial career path to “being your own boss” is exciting. But along with all your research, make sure to do your homework about yourself and your situation.\n\nA Few Questions to Ask Yourself:\nDo I have the personality, temperament, and mindset of taking on the world on my own terms?\nDo I have the required ambiance and resources to devote all my time to my venture?\nDo I have an exit plan ready with a clearly defined timeline in case my venture does not work?\nDo I have a concrete plan for the next \"x\" number of months or will I face challenges midway due to family, financial, or other commitments? Do I have a mitigation plan for those challenges?\nDo I have the required network to seek help and advice as needed?\nHave I identified and built bridges with experienced mentors to learn from their expertise?\nHave I prepared the rough draft of a complete risk assessment, including dependencies on external factors?\nHave I realistically assessed the potential of my offering and how it will figure in the existing market?\nIf my offering is going to replace an existing product in the market, how will my competitors react?\nTo keep my offering secure, will it make sense to get a patent? Do I have the capacity to wait that long?\nHave I identified my target customer base for the initial phase? Do I have scalability plans ready for larger markets?\nHave I identified sales and distribution channels?\nQuestions That Delve into External Factors:\nDoes my entrepreneurial venture meet local regulations and laws? If not feasible locally, can I and should I relocate to another region?\nHow long does it take to get the necessary license or permissions from concerned authorities? Can I survive that long?\nDo I have a plan about getting the necessary resources and skilled employees, and have I made cost considerations for the same?\nWhat are the tentative timelines for bringing the first prototype to market or for services to be operational?\nWho are my primary customers?\nWho are the funding sources I may need to approach to make this big? Is my venture good enough to convince potential stakeholders?\nWhat technical infrastructure do I need?\nOnce the business is established, will I have sufficient funds to get resources and take it to the next level? Will other big firms copy my model and kill my operation?\nFrequently Asked Questions About Entrepreneurship\nWhat Does It Mean to Be an Entrepreneur?\nAn entrepreneur is an individual who takes the risk to start their own business based on an idea they have or a product they have created while assuming most of the risks and reaping most of the rewards of the business.\n\nWhat Is the Best Definition of Entrepreneurship?\nEntrepreneurship is the process of setting up a business, taking it from an idea to realization.\n\nWhat Are the 4 Types of Entrepreneurs?\nSmall business, scalable startup, large company, and social.\n\nWhat Are the 7 Characteristics of Entrepreneurs?\nVersatile, resilient, flexible, money-savvy, business smart, focused, and communicators.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nAn entrepreneur is an individual who takes an idea or product and creates a business, a process known as entrepreneurship. Creating a business requires a lot of work and dedication, which not everyone is cut out for. Entrepreneurs are highly motivated risk-takers that have a vision and sacrifice a lot to achieve that vision.\n\nEntrepreneurs enter the market because they love what they do, believe their product will have a positive impact, and hope to make profits from their efforts. The steps entrepreneurs take fuel the economy; they create businesses that employ people and make products and services that consumers buy.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

{"id": "tYDvIyHxpxgIdO4t5qz7glOyNpWcHgUDt58bWFA1B74", "title": "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)", "body": "## What Is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)?\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in December 1970 by the executive order of President Richard Nixon. It is an agency of the United States federal government whose mission is to protect human and environmental health. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the EPA is responsible for creating standards and laws promoting the health of individuals and the environment.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* The Environmental Protection Agency is a United States federal government agency whose mission is to protect human and environmental health. \n* The EPA regulates the manufacturing, processing, distribution, and use of chemicals and other pollutants.\n* The agency enforces its findings through fines, sanctions, and other procedures. \n* It oversees programs to promote energy efficiency, environmental stewardship, sustainable growth, air and water quality, and pollution prevention. \n* Some of the areas that aren’t covered by the EPA include wildlife, wetlands, food safety, and nuclear waste.\n\n## Understanding the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\nWhy was the EPA created? It was formed in response to widespread public environmental concerns that gained momentum in the 1950s and 1960s. From the EPA’s creation, it has sought [to protect and conserve the natural environment](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021815/how-does-government-regulation-impact-metals-and-mining-sector.asp) and improve the health of humans by researching the effects of and mandating limits on the use of pollutants.\n\nThe EPA regulates the [manufacturing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/manufacturing.asp), processing, [distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp), and use of chemicals and other pollutants. Also, the EPA is charged with determining safe tolerance levels for chemicals and other pollutants in food, animal feed, and water.\n\nThe EPA enforces its findings through fines, [sanctions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/10/economic-sanctions.asp), and other procedures. Under the Trump administration, the EPA’s regulations of carbon emissions from power plants, automobiles, and other contributors to climate change, instituted by President Obama, were significantly [rolled back](https://www.investopedia.com/news/automakers-score-win-fuelefficiency-rules/). The EPA’s size and influence have also been diminished, and criminal prosecutions for those who aren’t following regulations are at a 30-year low.\n\nThe EPA is led by the EPA administrator, a cabinet-level post nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. That position is currently held by [Michael Regan](https://www.investopedia.com/michael-regan-5095184), the first Black man to ever hold that position. He is expected to reverse many of the regulatory rollbacks of the Trump administration.\n\n## Examples of EPA Programs\n\nThe EPA oversees several programs intended to promote energy efficiency, environmental stewardship, sustainable growth, air and water quality, and pollution prevention. These programs include:\n\n* **The EPA Safer Choice program**—formerly Design for the Environment—a product-labeling program that allows consumers to select the chemically safest products available, without sacrificing function or quality\n* **The Energy Star program**, which helps consumers choose energy-efficient appliances\n* **The Smart Growth program**, which supports sustainable community development\n* **WaterSense**, which encourages efficiency in water use via high-efficiency toilets, faucets, and irrigation equipment\n* **The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System**, which regulates the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters\n\nThe EPA protects human health and the environment with programs such as Safer Choice and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.\n\nThe EPA also runs programs to\n\n* Prevent, control, and respond to oil spills\n* Control air pollution and forecast air pollution levels\n* Foster the manufacturing of more fuel-efficient vehicles\n\n## How the EPA Enforces Laws\n\nTo protect communities and the environment, the EPA works to enforce laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the National Environmental Education Act, and the Clean Water Act, some of which predate the formation of the agency itself.\n\nThe EPA is also responsible for the detection and prevention of environmental crimes, monitoring pollution levels, and setting standards for the handling of hazardous chemicals and waste. As part of its strategic plan, when violations occur, the EPA investigates and pursues action against violators.\n\nEnvironmental offenses are categorized as civil or criminal. Civil offenses arise when environmental violations occur and no consideration is given to whether the offender knew of their transgression.1﻿ Criminal offenses, which comprise most of what the EPA investigates, arise when a violation occurs and the offender knew that their action caused it. Because of the severity of charges and punishment, criminal convictions require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nViolators can be held civilly and/or criminally responsible, with punishments for civil offenses ranging from monetary fines to repairing environmental damage and punishments for criminal offenses ranging from monetary relief to imprisonment.\n\n### $83.4 million\n\n*The largest civil penalty assessed for violating environmental law.2*﻿\n\nFor civil violations, the EPA may enforce actions by issuing orders or seeking court rulings. Criminal violations are enforced by the EPA or the governing state, with punishments imposed by a judge.\n\n## Examples of What the EPA Doesn’t Do\n\nBecause of its name, there tends to be some confusion about [what the EPA does and doesn’t do](https://publicaccess.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/212071687-Does-EPA-handle-all-environmental-concerns-). It doesn’t handle every issue or concern that affects the environment. The agency suggests contacting local, state, or other federal agencies to find out who is responsible.\n\nFor example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for the Endangered Species Act, while local and state wildlife officers are responsible for concerns about foxes, birds, rabbits, and other animals. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the agency that determines and issues permits for wetland areas. Food safety is the responsibility of the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fda.asp) (FDA), while issues about nuclear waste are handled by the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management.\n\n## Criticism of the EPA\n\nNot everyone supports the EPA. Some critics argue that the EPA's environmental regulations are too expensive and offer little benefits. Others claim that the EPA stifles the economy, contributes to unemployment rates, and adversely affects international trade.\n\nThese opponents believe that the associated costs for companies to remain in compliance with environmental laws and standards erode profits and cause widespread layoffs, contributing to unemployment. These absorbent costs also prevent companies from being competitive globally. They suggest that the costs are inflated and that those earmarked funds could be used for more productive ways to advance the economy and trade.\n\nSome proponents for environmental regulation disfavor the EPA for not acting swiftly on matters that concern the environment. For example, in 2020, Congress and environmentalists criticized the EPA for moving slowly on limiting the use of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances—toxic chemicals found to cause cancer, infertility, and other diseases.3﻿ Research shows that these toxins are contaminating the nation's drinking water and have been found in lifesaving equipment and household items. These critics claim that, in light of the research, the EPA is not doing enough or moving fast enough to protect public health.\n\nThe EPA responded with action plans to address how communities monitor and address PFAS contamination. However, critics argue that their plan lacks action and, as a result, is detrimental to the environment and the nation's citizens.\n\n## Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) FAQs\n\n### What Is the EPA and Why Was It Created?\n\nEstablished by President Nixon in December 1970, the EPA—a U.S. federal agency designed to protect human and environmental health— was created in response to heightened concerns about pollution and its negative externalities.\n\n### What Does the Environmental Protection Agency Do?\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) creates and enforces laws designed to protect the environment and human health.4 As part of their mission, they seek to ensure that Americans have a clean environment, including the air, water, and land they use and enjoy. In addition to creating and enforcing environmental laws, they provide education and guidance on protecting the environment, conduct research and development, issue grants to state programs, schools, and other non-profit organizations to further their mission, and more.\n\n### How Do I Get in Touch With the EPA?\n\nYou can contact the EPA online, by phone, or in writing. How to contact them depends on the nature of your concern or question. For more information, visit their website, [epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/forms/contact-epa).\n\n### What Is an EPA Violation?\n\nEPA violations consist of intentional and nonintentional violations of environmental laws. Common examples include illegal disposal of hazardous chemicals or products, illegal discharge of pollutants in bodies of water in the U.S., and tampering with water supplies.5﻿\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a federal government agency, created by the Nixon Administration, to protect human health and the environment. The EPA creates and enforces environmental laws, inspects the environment, and provides technical support to minimize threats and support recovery planning.\n\nIt consists of different programs—such as The Energy Star program, The Smart Growth Program, and Water Sense—that promote energy efficiency, environmental care, and pollution prevention. Not all concerns with the environment are handled by the EPA, however. For example, protecting endangered species falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and protecting our nation's wetlands is under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nCritics argue that the EPA imposes unnecessary and large costs on corporations and strains the economy and international trade.

{"id": "2IADrRu7yqFfYPz6Qwwct6fblUldCBdaHR7p_zuKHR4", "title": "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria", "body": "## What Are Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria?\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s behavior used by socially conscious investors to screen [potential investments](https://www.investopedia.com/mid-cap-esg-investing-5225784). Environmental criteria consider how a company safeguards the environment, including corporate policies addressing climate change, for example. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, [audits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp), [internal controls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internalcontrols.asp), and shareholder rights.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are used to screen investments based on corporate policies and to encourage companies to act responsibly.\n* Many mutual funds, brokerage firms, and robo-advisors now offer investment products that employ ESG criteria.\n* ESG criteria can also help investors avoid investment losses when companies engaged in risky or unethical practices are held accountable.\n* The rapid growth of ESG investment funds in recent years has led to claims that companies have been insincere or misleading in touting their ESG accomplishments.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 21 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:21\n\n#### Click Play to Learn What ESG Criteria Are\n\n## How Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria Work\n\nInvestors have, in recent years, shown interest in putting their money where their values are.\n\nAs a result, brokerage firms and mutual fund companies have started offering [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) and other financial products that follow ESG criteria. [Robo-advisors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp) including [Betterment](https://www.investopedia.com/betterment-review-4587887) and [Wealthfront](https://www.investopedia.com/wealthfront-review-4587933) have promoted these ESG-themed offerings to younger investors.\n\nESG criteria are also increasingly informing the investment choices of large institutional investors such as public pension funds. According to the most recent report from US SIF Foundation, investors held $17.1 trillion in assets chosen according to ESG criteria at the end of 2019, up from $12 trillion just two years earlier.1\n\nESG investing is sometimes referred to as [sustainable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp) investing, responsible investing, [impact investing](https://www.investopedia.com/investing-for-sustainability-impact-5210477), or [socially responsible investing (SRI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sri.asp). To assess a company based on ESG criteria, investors look at a broad range of behaviors and policies.\n\n### 58%\n\n*The share of respondents to a survey by Investopedia and Treehugger who indicated [increased interest in ESG investments](https://www.investopedia.com/demand-for-esg-investments-soars-emerging-from-covid-19-pandemic-5193532) in 2020. 19% reported using ESG considerations in selecting investments.*\n\n## Types of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria\n\nESG investors seek to ensure the companies they fund are responsible stewards of the environment, good corporate citizens and are led by accountable managers. \n \n\n### Environmental\n\nEnvironmental criteria may include corporate climate policies, energy use, waste, pollution, natural resource conservation, and treatment of animals. The criteria can also help evaluate any environmental risks a company might face and how the company is managing those risks.\n\nConsiderations may include direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, management of toxic waste, and compliance with environmental regulations.2\n\nHuman influence is unequivocally to blame for the warming of the planet and some forms of climate disruption are now locked in for centuries, according to a report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.3 \"This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels before they destroy our planet,\" said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.\n\n### Social\n\nSocial criteria look at the company’s relationships with [stakeholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stakeholder.asp).4\n\nDoes it hold suppliers to its own ESG standards? Does the company donate a percentage of its profits to the local community or encourage employees to perform volunteer work there?\n\nDo workplace conditions reflect high regard for employees’ health and safety? Or does the company take unethical advantage of its customers?\n\nOn May 18, S&P Dow Jones Indices published a blog post in which it explained its reasoning for removing Tesla from its S&P 500 ESG index. The company cited Tesla's \"lack of low carbon strategy,\" codes of business conduct, and its response to allegations of racism, poor working conditions, and investigations into accidents linked to autopilot features as primary reasons for its removal.5\n\n### Governance\n\nESG governance standards ensure a company uses accurate and transparent accounting methods, pursues integrity and diversity in selecting its leadership, and is accountable to shareholders.6\n\nESG investors may require assurances that companies avoid [conflicts of interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-of-interest.asp) in their choice of board members and senior executives, don't use political contributions to obtain preferential treatment, or engage in illegal conduct.\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nInvestment firms following ESG criteria often set their own priorities. For example, Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, with $5.6 billion under management as of December 2021, uses a variety of ESG factors to help identify companies positioned for strong long-term performance.7 \n\nThe criteria are set by analysts who identify the relevant issues facing specific sectors, industries, and companies. Trillium's ESG criteria preclude investments in the following:\n\n* Companies that operate in higher-risk areas or have exposure to coal or hard rock mining, nuclear or coal power, private prisons, agricultural biotechnology, tobacco, tar sands, or weapons and firearms.\n* Companies involved in major or recent controversies over human rights, animal welfare, environmental concerns, governance issues, or product safety.\n\nIn contrast, Trillium looks for investments meeting the following ESG criteria:\n\n### Environment\n\n* Publishes a carbon or sustainability report\n* Limits harmful pollutants and chemicals\n* Seeks to lower greenhouse gas emissions\n* Uses renewable energy sources \n \n\n### Social\n\n* Operates an ethical supply chain\n* Supports LGBTQ rights and encourages diversity\n* Has policies to protect against sexual misconduct\n* Pays fair wages \n \n\n### Governance\n\n* Embraces diversity on board of directors\n* Embraces corporate transparency\n* Someone other than the CEO is chair of the board\n\n## Pros and Cons of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria\n\nIn years past, the socially responsible investor was assumed to be sacrificing self-interest to some degree by avoiding some investments based on non-financial criteria. After all, tobacco and defense, two industries avoided by many ESG investors, have historically produced well-above-average market returns.\n\nMore recently, some have argued that, in addition to their social value, ESG criteria can help investors avoid the blowups that occur when companies operating in a risky or unethical manner are ultimately held accountable for its consequences. Examples include BP's ([BP](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=BP)) 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill and Volkswagen's emissions scandal, which rocked the companies' stock prices and cost them billions of dollars.\n\nAs ESG-minded business practices gain more traction, investment firms are increasingly tracking their performance. Financial services companies such as JPMorgan Chase ([JPM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm)), Wells Fargo ([WFC](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=wfc)), and Goldman Sachs ([GS](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=gs)) have published annual reports that extensively review their ESG approaches and the bottom-line results.8910\n\nThe ultimate value of ESG criteria will depend on whether they encourage companies to drive real change for the common good, or merely check boxes and publish reports.11 That, in turn, will depend on whether the investment flows follow ESG criteria that are realistic, measurable, and actionable. \n \n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

{"id": "bKkqDVnpl-5EZKYJJjBHzEqOGvZwGk1ewcTr5F4MOy4", "title": "A Boss Girl's Guide to Buying their First NFT", "body": "## Every boss girl assesses their income each year as well as investment opportunities. \n\n## In 2022, add NFT’s to your list.\n\n![Sell me this pen, it's an NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AgltfX9T5IMDGQVS3IV45.png?height=426&width=452)\n\nIn the last year, NFT’s or *‘non fungible tokens’* captured the spotlight of web3 enthusiasts and general folks around the world. For tech diehards, NFT’s were the first type of ‘social’ utility that blockchain could support that went beyond the tech community. For us less non technical people, it was the first time we saw the blockchain in action.\n\n### So you may ask yourself, why, as a non technical person, would I get involved in NFT’s in the first place? \n\nDon’t worry, I have asked myself this in the last year that I’ve been exploring the Web3. From **crypto**, the **Metaverse** to **NFT’s**, the world of the Web3 can be a demanding yet challenging learning curve that keeps getting deeper and deeper for those that dare to understand. I found myself in this exact position just over a year ago so let me share with you my own experience and why, as a non technical person, I invest in NFT’s. \n\n![You Wouldn't Screenshot an NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yIDuZHScUTwBOPwZtvQes.jpeg?height=389&width=750)\n\n### 1. Let’s start with defining what NFT’s are in the first place. \n\nNFT stands for **Non Fungible Token.**\n\nI know right, it still doesn’t make sense. Basically, when something is “Non Fungible”, it means that the item or '“thing” is unique and cannot be replaced with something else. If we use bitcoin for comparison, a bitcoin is *fungible* - because when you trade a bitcoin for another, you will have exactly the same thing. Bitcoin. \n\nBasically, in girl boss’ terms, let’s say you own a vintage Chanel bag. A vintage Chanel bag is also non fungible as when you trade it for another Chanel vintage bag, it’s different. It could be the same make from the same year but all vintage Chanel bags have different values due to wear, tear & simply, popularity. Many vintage Chanel bags are now super rare and are no longer in the market. This makes each one valuable. \n\n**Check out Kayla Trivieri known for her Tiktok videos on ‘NFT’s for Hot Girls’ explain NFT’s in action.**\n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@ktrivz/video/7044353616055995653?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1](https://www.tiktok.com/@ktrivz/video/7044353616055995653?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1)\n\n### 2. So now you know what non fungible means, let’s get into NFT’s. \n\nNow that you understand what ‘non-fungible’ items are, let’s add the last bit in that mentions ‘tokens’. NFT = non fungible tokens. \n\nBasically, the new internet also known as the ‘Web3’ is a token economy meaning that the way we exchange information and digital assets is by way of ‘tokens’. Still doesn’t make sense? It’s totally fine, there’s a bit of a learning curve so here’s a quick video on the history of the internet and why technologists are building a token based economy. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1vosF3cGOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1vosF3cGOE)\n\nHere’s my girl boss breakdown of it. The reason why technologists started the new internet AKA Web3 is because people, like you & me, were being taken advantaged off by Big tech. This is what is known as the ‘platform economy’ where most of our content had to be published on a platform and our data was sold behind our backs. \n\nNow with the Web3, the blockchain is the main network and when we publish articles like this one for example, it’s automatically published to the blockchain. This means that no one else owns this article I am writing, rather, I own it myself and the blockchain is the network I am publishing on. This means, as a whole, I own 100% of this article (ofcourse videos & images taken from others are owned by them).\n\nSo now that you have an understanding of what NFT’s are, non fungible tokens ‘*aka, one of a kind digital assets traded in Web3’*, let us go through its functionality. \n\n### 3. What are NFT’s used for?\n\nThis is probably the most important part. \n\nMany know NFT’s as JPEGs of random avatars that weirdly rose to popularity as the profile pictures for celebrities. We’ve seen Justin Bieber, Snoop Dogg, Steve Aoki and even Reese Whiterspoon talk about their love for NFT’s as well as their extensive investment in the space. So what exactly is it about these weird JPEG avatars that has attracted **over $17.6 billion in total sales** worldwide?\n\n![Bored Ape Yacht Club Avatars ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/61Glp6B8NCNkbMyXHYS2o.webp?height=1260&width=1890)\n\n**Investing in Art**\n\nFor many, an investment in the NFT space is an investment in the artist as well as the art itself. NFT’s have made it a lot easier to invest in art pieces that are generally only targeted to the 1% in the world due to gatekept events by large art curators like Sotheby’s and Christie’s. So unless you’re part of ‘that’ world, owning expensive and valuable art would not really be a possibility since membership is also based on invites. \n\nWith NFT’s, well known artists like [Beeple](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million) or [Banksy](https://www.artfixdaily.com/artwire/release/7931-historic-banksy%C2%A0-work-offered-as-an-nft-edition---with-a-chance-t) are able to share their art to millions more people around the world for a fraction of the cost. In fact, the most expensive NFT in the world was Beeple’s collage called ‘[Everydays: The First 5000 Days’](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-milli) which was auctioned at Christie’s for a whopping $69 million. This was a big statement in the NFT world to show everyone that NFT’s were worth something.\n\n**Investment in Musicians**\n\nHowever, NFT’s go beyond simply just ‘art’ or images. NFT’s as you know, is just a digital asset traded in the token economy ie the Web3, therefore the same structure can be applied to let’s say, music. Music is one of the world’s well known digital assets so it was only a step away from being formed into an NFT. \n\nFor investors, many do love to support indie musicians who they believe will be the next IT artist. As many know, music labels do take a very large % of a musicians profit and that’s why the industry has turned their heads to NFTs. With NFT’s, a musician can release their songs as an NFT, allowing people like you and I known as the “community” to purchase it and receive royalties as the song gains popularity. \n\n**Investment in Tech Products**\n\nSo this is the investment method I follow. \n\nReason being is I do not have the eye for art nor do I follow indie artists that I would love to support. However, being in the startup space for 5 years, I definitely have a more developed eye on tech products I believe can go the distance. I buy NFT’s released by startups who are building tech products for the Metaverse and the Web3 that I believe will transform the way we socialise.\n\nHere is the first NFT I bought from [Some Place Social](https://some.place/en-au), a startup building a mobile Metaverse that houses digital collections and transforms 3D communities. \n\n![Potion NFT from Some Place Social](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZvO0EBvOxaTg7RzmHy0pR.png?height=904&width=918)\n\nAnd here’s a quick look at what this NFT has unlocked for me. **This is my very own mobile Metaverse space that enables me to house ALL of my digital assets.** For transparency purposes, my Some Place Social NFT’s cost me around $700AUD which enabled me to access my own space in a Metaverse that could cost much more than this in the future. \n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@sharineleah/video/7091058213080026370?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en](https://www.tiktok.com/@sharineleah/video/7091058213080026370?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en)\n\nSo there are definitely different reasons why NFT’s are valuable but as an investor in the space, I definitely see NFT’s as a long term investment in a **project, person or idea** that you believe will grow long term. But you may ask yourself, if NFT’s are just a mechanism for investment, why are people saying it will change the internet?\n\n### 4. NFT’s is how we will trade in the future. \n\nBeyond investment or the general art/music/product assets attached to the NFT, NFT as tech is groundbreaking technology. The reason why NFT’s first entered the world as JPEG’s and art is because technologists needed to create something that could relate to everybody. This was the reason behind the birth of PFP’s or digital avatar NFT’s. \n\nBut beyond JPEG NFT’s or NFT’s launched by startups, non fungible tokens is truly remarkable technology that will enable transparent trade of digital assets around the world. In a world where intellectual property is still sooooo hard to prove, blockchain and NFT’s are now a mechanism to track IP for creators who build digital assets. \n\nAs content creators, we need this.\n\nAs technologists, we love this. \n\nAs lawyers, judiciary requires this. \n\nAnd as innovators, we empower this. \n\n### So what should you consider when buying your ever first ever NFT? \n\n✅ **CONSIDER THE TEAM/ARTIST**\n\nThe first thing to consider is who is the artist or the team behind the NFT. This is very important because generally ‘rugpulls’ which are fake NFT projects are done by a team that is not transparent of who they are. So what you’re looking for here are fully ‘doxxed’ teams, meaning teams that are proud of who they are, what they are building and their past experience to show why they can pull off this NFT collection or product.\n\n***New language:***\n\n**[Rugpulls: ](https://fortune.com/2022/03/02/crypto-scam-rug-pull-what-is-it/)**lucrative scams in which a crypto developer promotes a new project—usually a new token—to investors, and then disappears with tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n**[Fully Doxxed:](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/cryptocurrency-anonymity-alarm.html)** founder/s and crypto entrepreneurs that use their real names and publicise their backgrounds to the public to show transparency of the project or startup. This term rose as many in the Web3 space are anonymous. \n\n✅ **CONSIDER COMMUNITY**\n\nThe second thing to consider is whether or not the NFT project or startup is building a strong community. Since social media became a part of our lives, we all understand how important it is to build a strong community that backs your idea. NFT’s are no exceptions. \n\nKey strategies you can take here is to follow the NFT project or startup on **Twitter** and join their **discord channel**. If they are active on other social media platforms, this is great because it gives you an insight into who they are. I also like to check comments from their community to see if there are any red flags with the project. \n\n✅ **CONSIDER UTILITY**\n\nNow this item varies differently across people because the understanding of ‘valuable’ to each one of us is different. For myself, I like to see utility in terms of a product, real life one or a tech product, however this is where I find the most benefits and value. Some are okay with great merchandise and a strong community and many are okay with supporting the artist and the art itself. \n\nAs I previously mentioned, I do not have an eye for artists or art, so I generally gravitate towards projects or startups that are building technical products. Prior to my first NFT investment, I had been following the project for over a year and the founder was someone I followed from a previous startup she exited. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nUltimately, investing in NFT’s can be a time consuming yet enthralling experience especially because there are not a lot of investment opportunities that 10x within a few months. However, NFT’s are a very risky investment and can take many hours of research and community building in order to find the right one for you.\n\nIn my opinion, I love NFT’s not just for the startups I am able to support but also because I feel like I am part of the development of a piece of technology that will transform commerce. I do talk a lot about NFT’s and the Web3 on my Tiktok, so if you want to learn more, be sure to follow @sharineleah AKA Your Web3 Girl. \n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@sharineleah?lang=en](https://www.tiktok.com/@sharineleah?lang=en)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654660460, "digest": "xAZRCTkTrok3O1nv7JS4KKT45u7S7dN0X-go4j74xoI", "contributor": "0x817BBe6516e3e3f3732290261b351052698c8d97"}

{"id": "NOSlEiv8MKWAmj6YoqkYpDEuEmk-ha7MW6ZwLCsA7ns", "title": "Equity", "body": "## What Is Equity?\n\nEquity, typically referred to as shareholders' equity (or owners' equity for privately held companies), represents the amount of money that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the company's debt was paid off in the case of liquidation. In the case of acquisition, it is the value of company sales minus any liabilities owed by the company not transferred with the sale.\n\nIn addition, shareholder equity can represent the book value of a company. Equity can sometimes be offered as [payment-in-kind](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentinkind.asp). It also represents the pro-rata ownership of a company's shares.\n\nEquity can be found on a company's [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) and is one of the most common pieces of data employed by analysts to assess a company's financial health.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Equity represents the value that would be returned to a company’s shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the company's debts were paid off.\n* We can also think of equity as a degree of residual ownership in a firm or asset after subtracting all debts associated with that asset.\n* Equity represents the shareholders’ stake in the company, identified on a company's balance sheet.\n* The calculation of equity is a company's total assets minus its total liabilities, and it's used in several key financial ratios such as ROE.\n* Home equity is the value of a homeowner's property (net of debt) and is another way the term equity is used.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 2 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:02\n\n#### Equity\n\n## How Shareholder Equity Works\n\nBy comparing concrete numbers reflecting everything the company owns and everything it owes, the \"assets-minus-liabilities\" shareholder equity equation paints a clear picture of a company's finances, easily interpreted by investors and analysts. Equity is used as capital raised by a company, which is then used to purchase assets, invest in projects, and fund operations. A firm typically can raise capital by issuing debt (in the form of a loan or via bonds) or equity (by selling stock). Investors usually seek out equity investments as it provides greater opportunity to share in the profits and growth of a firm.\n\nEquity is important because it represents the value of an investor's stake in a company, represented by the proportion of its shares. Owning stock in a company gives shareholders the potential for capital gains and [dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinary-dividends.asp). Owning equity will also give shareholders the right to vote on corporate actions and elections for the board of directors. These equity ownership benefits promote shareholders' ongoing interest in the company.\n\nShareholder equity can be either negative or positive. If positive, the company has enough assets to cover its liabilities. If [negative](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/negative-shareholder-equity.asp), the company's liabilities exceed its assets; if prolonged, this is considered balance sheet insolvency. Typically, investors view companies with negative shareholder equity as risky or unsafe investments. Shareholder equity alone is not a definitive indicator of a company's financial health; used in conjunction with other tools and metrics, the investor can accurately analyze the health of an organization. \n \n\n## Formula and Calculation for Shareholder Equity\n\nThe following formula and calculation can be used to determine the equity of a firm, which is derived from the [accounting equation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-equation.asp):\n\n\\\\text{Shareholders' Equity} = \\\\text{Total Assets} - \\\\text{Total Liabilities}Shareholders’ Equity=Total Assets−Total Liabilities\n\nThis information can be found on the balance sheet, where these four steps should be followed:\n\n1. Locate the company's total assets on the balance sheet for the period.\n2. Locate total liabilities, which should be listed separately on the balance sheet.\n3. Subtract total liabilities from total assets to arrive at shareholder equity.\n4. Note that total assets will equal the sum of liabilities and total equity.\n\nShareholder equity can also be expressed as a company's share capital and [retained earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp) less the value of [treasury shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurystock.asp). This method, however, is less common. Though both methods yield the exact figure, the use of total assets and total liabilities is more illustrative of a company's financial health. \n \n\n## Components of Shareholder Equity\n\nRetained earnings are part of shareholder equity and are the percentage of net earnings that were not paid to shareholders as dividends. Think of retained earnings as savings since it represents a cumulative total of [profits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profits-interest.asp) that have been saved and put aside or retained for future use. Retained earnings grow larger over time as the company continues to reinvest a portion of its income.\n\nAt some point, the amount of accumulated retained earnings can exceed the amount of equity capital contributed by stockholders. Retained earnings are usually the largest component of stockholders' equity for companies operating for many years.\n\nTreasury shares or stock (not to be confused with U.S. Treasury bills) represent stock that the company has bought back from existing shareholders. Companies may do a repurchase when management cannot deploy all of the available equity capital in ways that might deliver the best returns. Shares bought back by companies become treasury shares, and the dollar value is noted in an account called treasury stock, a [contra account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contraaccount.asp) to the accounts of investor capital and retained earnings. Companies can reissue treasury shares back to stockholders when companies need to raise money.\n\nMany view stockholders' equity as representing a company's net assets—its net value, so to speak, would be the amount shareholders would receive if the company liquidated all of its assets and repaid all of its debts.\n\n## Example of Shareholder Equity\n\nUsing a historical example below is a portion of Exxon Mobil Corporation's [(XOM)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=xom) balance sheet as of September 30, 2018:\n\n* Total assets were $354,628.\n* Total liabilities were $157,797.\n* Total equity was $196,831.1\n\nThe accounting equation whereby Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder Equity is calculated as follows:\n\n> *Shareholder Equity = $354,628, (Total Assets) - $157,797 (Total Liabilities) = $196,8311*\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020\n\n## Other Forms of Equity\n\nThe concept of equity has applications beyond just evaluating companies. We can more generally think of equity as a degree of ownership in any asset after subtracting all debts associated with that asset.\n\nBelow are several common variations on equity:\n\n* A [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/083115/4-signs-penny-stock-worth-millions.asp) or any other security representing an ownership interest in a company.\n* On a company's balance sheet, the amount of funds contributed by the owners or shareholders plus the retained earnings (or losses). One may also call this stockholders' equity or shareholders' equity.\n* The value of securities in a margin account minus what the account holder borrowed from the brokerage in margin trading.\n* In real estate, the difference between the property's current [fair market value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp) and the amount the owner still owes on the mortgage. It is the amount that the owner would receive after selling a property and paying any liens. Also referred to as \"[real property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-property.asp) value.\"\n* When a business goes bankrupt and has to [liquidate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp), equity is the amount of money remaining after the business repays its creditors. This is often called \"ownership equity,\" also known as risk [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033015/what-difference-between-paidup-capital-and-share-capital.asp) or \"liable capital.\"\n\n## Private Equity \n\nWhen an investment is publicly traded, the [market value of equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-value-of-equity.asp) is readily available by looking at the company's share price and its [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/). For private entitles, the market mechanism does not exist, so other valuation forms must be done to estimate value.\n\n[Private equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp) generally refers to such an evaluation of companies that are not publicly traded. The accounting equation still applies where stated equity on the balance sheet is what is left over when subtracting liabilities from assets, arriving at an estimate of [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp). Privately held companies can then seek investors by selling off shares directly in private placements. These private equity investors can include institutions like pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies, or accredited individuals.\n\nPrivate equity is often sold to funds and investors that specialize in direct investments in private companies or that engage in [leveraged buyouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp) (LBOs) of public companies. In an LBO transaction, a company receives a loan from a private equity firm to fund the acquisition of a division of another company. Cash flows or the assets of the company being acquired usually secure the loan. Mezzanine debt is a private loan, usually provided by a commercial bank or a mezzanine venture capital firm. Mezzanine transactions often involve a mix of debt and equity in a subordinated loan or warrants, common stock, or preferred stock.\n\nPrivate equity comes into play at different points along a company's life cycle. Typically, a young company with no revenue or earnings can't afford to borrow, so it must get capital from friends and family or individual \"[angel investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/angelinvestor.asp).\" Venture capitalists enter the picture when the company has finally created its product or service and is ready to bring it to market. Some of the largest, most successful corporations in the tech sector, like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta, formerly Facebook—or what is referred to as BigTechs or [GAFAM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gafam-stocks.asp)—all began with venture capital funding.\n\n## Types of Private Equity Financing\n\n[Venture capitalists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapitalist.asp) (VCs) provide most private equity financing in return for an early minority stake. Sometimes, a venture capitalist will take a seat on the board of directors for its portfolio companies, ensuring an active role in guiding the company. Venture capitalists look to hit big early on and exit investments within five to seven years. An LBO is one of the most common types of private equity financing and might occur as a company matures.\n\nA final type of private equity is a Private Investment in a Public Company (PIPE). A [PIPE](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp) is a private investment firm's, a mutual fund's, or another qualified investors' purchase of stock in a company at a discount to the current market value (CMV) per share to raise capital.\n\nUnlike shareholder equity, private equity is not accessible for the average individual. Only \"accredited\" investors, those with a net worth of at least $1 million, can take part in private equity or venture capital partnerships. Such endeavors might require [form 4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form4.asp), depending on their scale.2 For investors who don't meet this marker, there is the option of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on investing in private companies.\n\n## Home Equity \n\n[Home equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/home_equity.asp) is roughly comparable to the value contained in homeownership. The amount of equity one has in their residence represents how much of the home they own outright by subtracting from the mortgage debt owed. Equity on a property or home stems from payments made against a mortgage, including a down payment and increases in property value.\n\nHome equity is often an individual’s greatest source of collateral, and the owner can use it to get a home equity loan, which some call a [second mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondmortgage.asp) or a [home equity line of credit](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/) (HELOC). An equity takeout is taking money out of a property or borrowing money against it.\n\nFor example, let’s say Sam owns a home with a mortgage on it. The house has a current market value of $175,000, and the mortgage owed totals $100,000. Sam has $75,000 worth of equity in the home or $175,000 (asset total) - $100,000 (liability total).\n\n## Brand Equity \n\nWhen determining an asset's equity, particularly for larger corporations, it is important to note these assets may include both tangible assets, like property, and intangible assets, like the company's reputation and brand identity. Through years of advertising and the development of a customer base, a company's brand can come to have an inherent value. Some call this value \"[brand equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brandequity.asp),\" which measures the value of a brand relative to a generic or store-brand version of a product.\n\nFor example, many soft-drink lovers will reach for a Coke before buying a store-brand cola because they prefer the taste or are more familiar with the flavor. If a 2-liter bottle of store-brand cola costs $1 and a 2-liter bottle of Coke costs $2, then Coca-Cola has brand equity of $1.\n\nThere is also such a thing as negative brand equity, which is when people will pay more for a generic or store-brand product than they will for a particular brand name. Negative brand equity is rare and can occur because of bad publicity, such as a [product recall](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product_recall.asp) or a disaster.\n\n## Equity vs. Return on Equity\n\n[Return on equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholder equity. Because shareholder equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE could be considered the return on net assets. ROE is considered a measure of how effectively management uses a company’s assets to create profits.\n\nEquity, as we have seen, has various meanings but usually represents ownership in an asset or a company, such as stockholders owning equity in a company. ROE is a financial metric that measures how much profit is generated from a company’s shareholder equity.\n\n## What Is Equity in Finance?\n\nEquity is an important concept in finance that has different specific meanings depending on the context. Perhaps the most common type of equity is “shareholders’ equity,\" which is calculated by taking a company’s total assets and subtracting its total liabilities.\n\nShareholders’ equity is, therefore, essentially the net worth of a corporation. If the company were to liquidate, shareholders’ equity is the amount of money that would theoretically be received by its shareholders.\n\n## What Are Some Other Terms Used to Describe Equity?\n\nOther terms that are sometimes used to describe this concept include shareholders’ equity, book value, and net asset value. Depending on the context, the precise meanings of these terms may differ, but generally speaking, they refer to the value of an investment that would be left over after paying off all of the liabilities associated with that investment. This term is also used in real estate investing to refer to the difference between a property’s fair market value and the outstanding value of its mortgage loan.\n\n## How Is Equity Used by Investors?\n\nEquity is a very important concept for investors. For instance, in looking at a company, an investor might use shareholders’ equity as a benchmark for determining whether a particular purchase price is expensive. If that company has historically traded at a price to book value of 1.5, for instance, then an investor might think twice before paying more than that valuation unless they feel the company’s prospects have fundamentally improved. On the other hand, an investor might feel comfortable buying shares in a relatively weak business as long as the price they pay is sufficiently low relative to its equity.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\n\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can [choose from 183,000 online video courses.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssLXl_Jh2mkqv8Gn_oc1fqVWG5odSlQWx41I9hjuBkRlcOkeN2hlvBX-KXYePZcV8nIG3NCG7kNw3yYsbeviwanyEAUUhqMTVWxCmcd2e1HKsF1mDVZe5U_uKDk7_-STgBKd9oakbPZhOq7vg71he6qEE_MtFA9flahaBo3RCqMsosjBftjPas4_kG2UxvseTBK0wReGHdwZYsMYfHq1H99miIfssn0FIqLil6T0rxJrx4uc-NkZMQixkuM62fdXUhlUSc6oUqp8HuyXPk7LdbA_zec_1DJPRqDrCP3XPIAR0B_tTP2iMPrK3LsxnuO4ySvdFTZg4kMoM3vJJM7bAQqgpGz4fz_sAfip5ZuHwQVbmk&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMx4i8PRYzMbEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) With Udemy, you’ll be able to [learn accounting terminology](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjssLXl_Jh2mkqv8Gn_oc1fqVWG5odSlQWx41I9hjuBkRlcOkeN2hlvBX-KXYePZcV8nIG3NCG7kNw3yYsbeviwanyEAUUhqMTVWxCmcd2e1HKsF1mDVZe5U_uKDk7_-STgBKd9oakbPZhOq7vg71he6qEE_MtFA9flahaBo3RCqMsosjBftjPas4_kG2UxvseTBK0wReGHdwZYsMYfHq1H99miIfssn0FIqLil6T0rxJrx4uc-NkZMQixkuM62fdXUhlUSc6oUqp8HuyXPk7LdbA_zec_1DJPRqDrCP3XPIAR0B_tTP2iMPrK3LsxnuO4ySvdFTZg4kMoM3vJJM7bAQqgpGz4fz_sAfip5ZuHwQVbmk&sig=Cg0ArKJSzMx4i8PRYzMbEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RL7M2q\\*4kuk&mid=39197&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftopic%2Faccounting%2F) and how to prepare financial statements and analyze business transactions.

Firms often use EAC for capital budgeting decisions, as it allows a company to compare the cost-effectiveness of various assets with unequal lifespans.\n\n0:46\nEquivalent Annual Cost (EAC)\nUnderstanding the Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC)\nEquivalent annual cost (EAC) is used for a variety of purposes, including capital budgeting. But it is used most often to analyze two or more possible projects with different lifespans, where costs are the most relevant variable.\n\nOther uses of EAC include calculating the optimal life of an asset, determining if leasing or purchasing an asset is the better option, determining the magnitude of which maintenance costs will impact an asset, determining the necessary cost savings to support purchasing a new asset, and determining the cost of keeping existing equipment.\n\nThe EAC calculation factors in a discount rate or the cost of capital. Cost of capital is the required return necessary to make a capital budgeting project—such as building a new factory—worthwhile. Cost of capital includes the cost of debt and the cost of equity and is used by companies internally to judge whether a capital project is worth the expenditure of resources.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nEquivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annual cost of owning, operating, and maintaining an asset over its entire life.\nEAC is often used by firms for capital budgeting decisions, as it allows a company to compare the cost-effectiveness of various assets that have unequal lifespans.\nEAC allows managers to compare the net present values of different projects over different periods, to accurately determine the best option.\nThe Formula for the Equivalent Annual Cost\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{EAC} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Asset Price} \\\\times \\\\text{Discount Rate} }{ 1 - ( 1 + \\\\text{Discount Rate})^{-n} } \\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\\\text{Discount Rate} = \\\\text{Return required to make project} \\\\ &\\\\text{worthwhile} \\\\ &n = \\\\text{Number of periods} \\\\ \\\\end{aligned}\n​\n\nEAC=\n1−(1+Discount Rate)\n−n\n\nAsset Price×Discount Rate\n​\n\nwhere:\nDiscount Rate=Return required to make project\nworthwhile\nn=Number of periods\n​\n\nHow to Calculate the Equivalent Annual Cost\nTake the asset price or cost and multiply it by the discount rate.\nThe discount rate is also called the cost of capital, which is the required return necessary to make a capital budgeting project, such as building a new factory, worthwhile.\nIn the denominator add 1 + the discount rate and raise the result as an exponent to the number of years for the project. Subtract the result by 1 and divide the numerator figure by the denominator.\nMany financial online calculators are available to calculate EAC.\nExample of the Equivalent Annual Cost\nAs stated earlier, EAC allows managers to compare NPVs of different projects over different periods, to accurately determine the best option. Consider two alternative investments in machinery equipment:\n\n1. Machine A has the following:\n\nAn initial capital outlay of $105,000\nAn expected lifespan of three years\nAn annual maintenance expense of $11,000\n2\\. Machine B has the following:\n\nAn initial capital outlay of $175,000\nAn expected lifespan of five years\nAn annual maintenance expense of $8,500\nThe cost of capital for the company making the decision is thus 5%.\n\nNext, we calculate the EAC, which is equal to the net present value (NPV) divided by the present value annuity factor or A(t,r), while taking into account the cost of capital or r, and the number of years in question or t.\n\nThe annuity factor is calculated as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Annuity Factor} = \\\\frac{ 1 - \\\\frac{ 1 }{ ( 1 + r ) ^ t} }{ r } \\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &r = \\\\text{Cost of capital} \\\\ &t = \\\\text{Number of periods} \\\\ \\\\end{aligned}\n​\n\nAnnuity Factor=\nr\n1−\n(1+r)\nt\n\n1\n​\n\n​\n\nwhere:\nr=Cost of capital\nt=Number of periods\n​\n\nUsing the formula above, the annuity factor or A(t,r) of each project must be calculated. These calculations would be as follows:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Machine A, A(t, r)} = \\\\frac{ 1 - \\\\frac{ 1 }{ ( 1 + .05) ^ 3 } }{ .05 } = 2.72 \\\\ \\\\end{aligned}\n​\n\nMachine A, A(t, r)=\n.05\n1−\n(1+.05)\n3\n\n1\n​\n\n​\n=2.72\n​\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Machine B, A(t, r)} = \\\\frac{ 1 - \\\\frac{ 1 }{ ( 1 + .05) ^ 5 } }{ .05 } = 4.33 \\\\ \\\\end{aligned}\n​\n\nMachine B, A(t, r)=\n.05\n1−\n(1+.05)\n5\n\n1\n​\n\n​\n=4.33\n​\n\nNext, the initial costs must be divided by the annuity factor or A(t,r) while adding in the annual maintenance cost. The calculation for EAC is:\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{EAC Machine A} = \\\\frac{ $105,000 }{ 2.72 } + $11,000 = $49,557 \\\\ \\\\end{aligned}\n​\n\nEAC Machine A=\n2\\.72\n$105,000\n​\n\\+$11,000=$49,557\n​\n\n\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{EAC Machine B} = \\\\frac{ $175,000 }{ 4.33 } + $8,500 = $48,921 \\\\ \\\\end{aligned}\n​\n\nEAC Machine B=\n4\\.33\n$175,000\n​\n\\+$8,500=$48,921\n​\n\nBy standardizing the annual cost, a manager in charge of a capital budgeting decision where cost is the only issue would select Machine B because it has an EAC that is $636 lower than Machine A.\n\nThe Difference Between the Equivalent Annual Cost and the Whole-life Cost\nWhole-life cost is the total expense of owning an asset over its entire life, from purchase to disposal, as determined by financial analysis. It is also known as a \"life-cycle\" cost, which includes purchase and installation, design and building costs, operating costs, maintenance, associated financing costs, depreciation, and disposal costs.\n\nWhole-life cost also takes into account certain costs that are usually overlooked, such as those related to environmental and social impact factors.\n\nThe equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annual cost of owning, operating, and maintaining an asset over its entire life while the whole life cost is the total cost of the asset over its entire life.\n\nLimitations of Using the Equivalent Annual Cost\nA limitation with EAC, as with many capital budgeting decisions, is that the discount rate or cost of capital must be estimated for each project. Unfortunately, the forecast can turn out to be inaccurate, or variables can change over the life of the project or life of the asset that's be considered.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Accounting\nWhatever your learning style, understanding corporate finance and accounting is easy when you can choose from 183,000 online video courses.

People looking at each-other (not the camera) allow for **well composed observational action moments** creating beautiful photos with emphasis on body language and expression from often subtly lit and challenging environments.\n\n![A bit of laughter](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/62JlzeDkge5fX9S8mZ-1-.png?height=580&width=1480&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n![new friends...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lp54KH8F9IFWh867NuDzS.png?height=533&width=1482&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n![and a variety of expressions ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1Sq19jiql-EI-vrFCekV9.png?height=569&width=1471&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n*(credits to [Mervin](https://www.instagram.com/surrephoto/) for 3 excellent examples)*\n\n## Benefits\n\nWe give official status to out top eagle-eyed shooters, to those who show artistic flair and ingenuity in their photography.\n\nCapturing people when they’re deep in their most memorable moments without them noticing is a fine art that deserves recognition when done well.\n\n**Benefits include:**\n\n* Certificate of recommendation.\n* ML Official Photographer watermark.\n* Access to our inner community networks\n* Access to paid assignments from our international team.\n* Join our team at local private events.\n\n## Equipment & Settings\n\n### DSLR\n\nAll photographers should use a DSLR camera. Cell phone or point-and-shoot/pocket camera photography is not acceptable.\n\n### Available Light Photography\n\nOur venues are often dimly lit, taking photos with available light is challenging. However, the benefits are that you can capture attractive images of the vibe and ambience in a place.\n\n1. **Camera:** Be sure to have a camera that performs well at very high ISO sensitivity. For instance, the Canon 6D or 5D Mark III will allow you to go up to ISO 10,000 and still get crisp photos. Of course, there will be noise, but with the right noise reduction, you can convert it into a non-distracting grain when you retouch your photos.\n2. **Lens:** Ideally, use a 50mm f/1.4 lens. These very popular lenses are also known as “nifty fifty” lenses, and are available quite affordably for both Nikon and Canon. Presumably, the same applies for other camera brands.\n3. **Shutter speed:** at high ISO and wide openings, you should be able to get anywhere between 1/30 and 1/100 even in low-light environments. Note that for anything longer than 1/30, you will need a very very steady hand.\n4. **Focus:** careful: at f/1.4, your depth of field will be extremely shallow. Manually select your AF point when shooting, point it over an area with good light/dark contrast so the camera can focus, then shoot. Afterwards, check our images for sharpness by zooming in on the spot you wanted in focus (preferably a person's eyes) when you review them.\n\n### Flash Photography\n\n**Shutter Speed:** It’s advisable to work with a shutter speed between 1/15 and 1/30 allowing for plenty of exposure to background light and not just the exposure of your flash victim's face.\n\n**Flash:** Don’t shoot straight into people’s faces. It will annoy them and make them look flat. Some photographers point their flash at the ceiling or find inventive ways to disperse the light around the room. Photos with obright faces and dark backgrounds are not okay for publication.\n\n**AF Points:** If you give the camera automatic control over autofocus (AF) points, it may focus on things you don’t want it to.\n\nIn this shot, the guy's hair on the right (red box) is sharp and crisp, but it’s not the intended subject. Instead, we should focus on the well-lit guy's face (green).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WGHoS31EbnZJKR7xUvFt1.png?height=667&width=1000)\n\n\\*\\*Here is a mock-up of the Canon EOS 6D’s AF point layout:\\*\\*In this example, it’s best to manually select the top AF point (in red, as above) so that the camera focuses on the subject’s eye.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YWJavSolFno_cAWq-df2s.png?height=692&width=1000)\n\nAlternately, leave the middle AF point always selected, use that to focus, and then recompose the shot before triggering the shutter.\n\n## Learn from others.\n\nThe Internet is full of videos and tutorials offering advice and technique for developing and expanding your skill set. Keep educating yourself and compare tips with your colleagues.\n\n## The Candid Sniper’s Guide\n\n### Camouflage |\n\nTo capture people looking natural and not posing, we blend into the background like a world-class ninja. Only by passing by unnoticed do we capture participants off-guard, looking natural and not posing.\n\n### Sniper |\n\n* Try from a high-bar stool, the door, behind the bar, a DJ booth, **a tree, get up there!**\n* Shots from a distance or a high vantage point help achieve natural shots.\n* If there's enough light available, go with a zoom or telephoto lens.\n\n**Step by step, candid photos:**\n\n1. Walk around, observe light **sources**.\n2. Find light falling on **faces**.\n3. Study that **person**. How do they carry themselves, where do they stand in relation to the rest of the group?\n4. Study the **surroundings**. Are there people nearby? Are they distracting because they, too, face your camera? If it’s an empty part of the bar, can you get more people will be in the frame?\n5. Look through the camera at the scene and look at **everything in the frame**. How is your angle? Can you move up or down, left or right for a changed picture? Can you move closer or further away for a better picture?\n6. Now, select the **AF point** in your camera that lies over the subject you want to have in focus (see “AF Points” above for more info).\n7. Focus and take **photos** of the scene. 4, 5, more if necessary.\n8. **Review** these photos closely in your camera. Look at the frame, zoom in to see if your focus is on, look at everybody's faces. If somebody looks dumb, blurry or badly under/overexposed, try again.\n9. **Repeat this** until you have a great shot of the scene.\n\n## Post Production\n\nUse post production software, even if just to tweak the white balance. Recommended programs:\n\n* **[Adobe Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html)** (paid, available by subscription to Adobe Cloud)\n* **[Darktable](http://www.darktable.org/)** (free open-source alternative to Lightroom.

These are just a few of the many large investors who have added FAANG stocks to their [portfolios](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) because of their perceived strength, growth, or [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp). \n\nEach of the FAANG stocks trades on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) exchange and is included in the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp). Since the S&P 500 is a broad representation of the market, the movement of the market mirrors the index's movement. As of August 2021, the FAANGs make up about 19% of the S&P 500—a staggering figure considering the S&P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the [United States economy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/042915/5-industries-driving-us-economy.asp) as a whole.\n\nThis large influence over the index means that [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) in the stock price of the FAANG stocks can have a substantial effect on the performance of the S&P 500 in general. In August 2018, for example, FAANG stocks were responsible for nearly 40% of the index’s gain from the lows reached in February 2018.\n\n## Example of FAANG Stocks\n\nThe extraordinary size and influence of the FAANG stocks have prompted concerns about a potential [bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp) in FAANG stocks. These concerns started gaining prominence in 2018, when technology stocks, which had been driving consistent gains in the stock market, began losing their former strength. In November 2018, several FAANG stocks lost more than 20% of their valuations and were declared to be in [bear territory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp).6 By some estimates, FAANG stocks lost more than a trillion dollars from their peak valuations as a result of the steep drop in the markets in November 2018.6\n\nAlthough their valuations have since recovered, the level of volatility sometimes shown by FAANG stocks—and the oversized influence these stocks can have on the market overall—is a source of concern for some investors.\n\nOn the other hand, those who believe in the fundamental strength of the FAANG stocks have abundant evidence for this claim. For example, Facebook is the world’s largest [social network](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-networking.asp) with approximately 2.8 billion users. In its 2021 annual report, Meta posted revenues of $118 billion and [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) of $39.4 billion.7\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, has become a seemingly insurmountable force in [business-to-consumer (B2C)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp) e-commerce. With over 120 million products for sale, it has over 300 million active customers in the United States, of whom more than half pay for monthly Amazon Prime memberships.8 With 2021 TTM revenues of $470 billion and a net income of $33.4 billion, it is not hard to understand why investors believe Amazon’s vast market capitalization is justified.9\n\nOverall, it is through strong financial performance such as this that the FAANG stocks have prospered recently. Over the past five years, for instance, Meta and Amazon have seen stock-price increases of 185% and 500%, respectively. For their part, Apple and Alphabet saw price increases of about 175% over that same timeframe, whereas Netflix saw its value rise by nearly 450%.\n\n## What Makes FAANG Stocks So Popular?\n\nThe five stocks that make up the “FAANG” acronym—Meta ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=FB)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AMZN)), Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL4)), Netflix ([NFLX](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=NFLX)), and Alphabet ([GOOG](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GOOG))—are all well-known brands among consumers. But they are also famous for their remarkable growth in recent years, with market capitalizations ranging from $166 billion (in the case of Netflix) to $2.7 trillion (in the case of Apple), as of Q1 2022.32 From an investment perspective, these five stocks are generally praised for their stellar historical track records and clear leadership positions within their industries.\n\n## Are FAANG Stocks Overvalued?\n\nInvestors disagree about whether the FAANG stocks are overvalued. Their proponents will argue that their valuations are justified based on their fundamental strength as businesses. But critics argue that, even with impressive business performance, the FAANG stocks’ prices have become so expensive that it may be difficult to realize attractive long-term profits from investing in them. Ultimately, this “debate” between investors is best captured by the buying and selling patterns in the FAANG stocks themselves.\n\n## Are FAANG Stocks Hard to Acquire?\n\nNo. The FAANG stocks are all easy to acquire, in the sense that they are publicly traded companies with substantial daily trading volumes. They are also routinely included in popular [exchange-traded funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETFs). However, investors who believe that the FAANG stocks may be overvalued would argue that they are difficult to acquire at an economical price. These investors may be tempted to delay purchasing FAANG stocks, waiting for their valuations to decline.\n\n## Who Coined the Term FANG Stocks?\n\nWhile Jim Cramer certainly popularized the term, he himself credits Bob Lang, a *Real Money* and *The Street* colleague of Cramer's, with identifying these four stocks and inventing the acronym.10\n\nLearn the Basics of Trading and Investing\n\nLooking to learn more about trading and investing?

After reading through the latest proposal he put forth, it’s looking likely that it will be $LUNA/$UST that dies instead. I read it multiple times & still can’t believe how he thought that was a good idea. If i was a $LUNA/$UST holder that got rekt, it feels more like a slap in the face more than anything. The only ones that stood to win from that was them. Forget about killing 2 birds with 1 stone. This was intended to kill multiple with 1/4 of a stone. Below is an excerpt from the proposal, the last 2 points in bold is mindblowing.\n\n> Token Distribution\n>\n> 1,000,000,000 Luna tokens\n>\n> 25% - Community pool, controlled by staked governanc 1% - Essential Developers emergency allocation. No lockup 4% - Essential developers (1 year cliff, 4 year vesting thereafter, granted after launch traction) 35% - All bonded / unbonded Luna, minus **TFL at “Pre-attack” snapshot** For wallets with < 1M Luna: 1 year cliff, 2 year vesting thereafter For wallets with > 1M Luna: 1 year cliff, 4 year vesting thereafter **10% - Luna holders (staking derivatives included) at the “Launch” snapshot - 10% unlocked at genesis, 90% vested over 2 years thereafter 25% - UST holders at the “Launch” snapshot - 10% unlocked at genesis, rest vested over 2 years thereafter**\n\nNot sure how i would feel if i was a $LUNA / $UST holder that got rekt, seeing people who buy & hold either right now at these prices getting rewarded for it, even if it was a small %.\n\nMy interpretation of that is, trying to incentivize new money with the promise of an airdrop. Puts buy pressure for both assets. making it a little more palatable for those that got burned hard to exit at a relatively better price. 35% of total tokens, for leeches (maybe like me) getting rewarded for basically buying at shib like prices.\n\nSo existing holders will be made partly whole & best part is, this requires nothing from TFL’s end. Who knows, maybe a good time for insiders to exit stage left as well. Talk about a great deal. oooooh weee does that sound good.\n\nThe other point, looks like a gesture of goodwill to exclude the TFL wallet, but is it really? Though Do mentioned that he sold no LUNA / UST during the debacle, its just his word against yours. remember trust but verify? Also, it almost certain that even with this insane drawdown, its safe to assume that Do (& probably team?) personally is still wealthy. **Of course, its not his personal responsibility to reimburse everyone that got rekt** but also don’t fit something in there to make it seem like it’s some big sacrifice.\n\n1 other thing to point out, the unfortunate part. is that the protocols building on terra are now, forgive my french, but fucked. everything revolved around LUNA/UST & if it goes to shit(even more than already is), they’ll have to rebuild elsewhere. but i’m already seeing a couple publicly reaching out (FTM/OSMOSIS) who will be more than happy to onboard them & im more than happy to use them if there’s value.\n\nFinally, my ****uneducated opinion**** of what will happen:\n\n*   Proposal completely backfires on him, because of the reasons i stated above.\n*   Exisiting holders who baghold it down feels insulted & just dumps it all. accepting defeat.\n*   Which then leads to even lower prices, too much for most to withstand.\n*   Puke again\n*   Trust completely decimated\n*   A mass migration of protocols\n*   Goblin town, ghost chain city\n*   The end.\n\nQuestion is, by whose hand did luna/ust die from?\n", "timestamp": 1654661171, "digest": "ZQ2KsAOU2KkrEmvsNqxBupXEx-NCwLAnVi9ySdAJgr4", "contributor": "0x5f73a24771940b8c80b3570694072f606DF913cc"}

While reading Rich man's proposal, a couple paragraphs stood out.\n\n1\\)\"While a decentrailized economy does need decentralized money, UST has lost too much trust with its users to play the role.\n\nSo what remains? While UST has been the central narrative of Terra’s growth story over the last year, the Terra ecosystem and its community is what is worth preserving.\"\n\n*   My brain: things that are noteworthy? Do admits that UST has lost trust & has no role to play in the ecosystem, with that comes \"wtf is UST used for now?\" Besides scalping irresponsibly on low time frames. Lol. The founder saying it's a lost cause & of no use. That's telling.\n\n2.  \"But the priority now should be to preserve this amazing ecosystem and to make as many users and builders as possible. Terra should first preserve its L1, and the community should gather to discuss decentralized money once the dust has settled.\n\n*   My brain: Rich man emphasizes the **priority**: the terra ecosystem & community. But what does community mean? Unless people are made whole or partly, those badly burnt by this ain't staying nor coming back. No mention of a UST & certainly not LUNA compensation. Preserving L1, who does that benefit?\\*\n\nWith regards to the allocation of how the new tokens are to be distributed based on the proposal, while he does say to exclude the TFL wallet, it doesn't talk about his own.Dont know how much he owns personally but still, he would stand to benefit nicely via his personal holdings does he not?\n\n\\*Side note: i haven't looked into it & might be wrong. But from the outside, it looks as though TFL has its hands inside a lot of cookie jars, well most of the dapps at least. So don't quote me.\n\n\\==Personal opinion==: while he does make comments about making ust holders whole. It feels more like a passing comment rather than a priority. Rich man admits defeat to UST now being useless(not even fit for a paperweight). Regardless of what proposal goes through, highly unlikely that should there be a new chain, that anyone who bought after the meltdown would be entitled to much. If any. Also I'm sure the \"10% proposed for Luna holders at the final moment of the chain halt\" would be based on balances on-chain. Not on CEXs.\n\nI'm just ranting on my phone. There will be spelling,grammar & factual mistakes. It is what it is. Though I should make it clear i feel for those that lost it all or majority of their holdings. I don't take pleasure in seeing others fail.\n\nHowever, you might see me constantly rubbing it in whenever this specific person tweets but that's only because, in the words of Tony Montana \"I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it coming to them.\"\n", "timestamp": 1654661063, "digest": "Xn6fVjxSm17M3KLNTQUCOTTyQBKZyq0poy4RvVyYsC4", "contributor": "0x5f73a24771940b8c80b3570694072f606DF913cc"}

Everyday that it is left in limbo is another day that an anon has to deal with the ambiguity of the situation. As harsh as it sounds, it would be better imo to just announce that this mess has spiraled out of control and is now too big for Terra / LFG / Rich man to handle. Kill it, shut it down, start afresh. It will hurt but it will take a lot of the ambiguity away & people can start making plans on how to deal with their own personal situation.\n\nRebuild, use multiple snapshots to carefully distribute the tokens of this new ecosystem. And for the love of the moon, please don’t announce that anyone that buys & holds luna/ust right now, today up till the date of a proposed snapshot should be entitled to any. Its downright stupid & makes it look like an even bigger ponzi. New money to be used to pay the old holders.\n\nBased on terra station, there is currently 6.9 TRILLION luna in circulation. insanity. but let’s do some quick math.\n\n6900000000000 x 0.000181 = 1,235,100,000\n\nSo roughly about 1.2Billion to buyback all the luna in circulation. im sure they “could” somehow raise or get that but what then? Buying back all the luna and burning them doesn’t automagically repegs UST or shoot luna back to $100.\n\nTo end, though i have no horse in this race, i would urge the people at TFL to make a swift decision instead of staying silent and leaving people in the lurch.\n\nGodspeed friends.\n", "timestamp": 1654661327, "digest": "VOlCvrEzkuUmizgzkDa-HaRPF4Pm7JFaeltkiGHSwyQ", "contributor": "0x5f73a24771940b8c80b3570694072f606DF913cc"}
{"id": "wDc_MvKldZ-xsYf836ZLiu6A5r47SPmha4xjNN-zFOY", "title": "HashMap原理解析", "body": "一、hashmap的数据结构\n底层数组+单向链表，jdk1.8后，链表长度大于8，并且数组长度大于64，将转为用红黑树存储\n\n二、hashmap用了hash为什么还要equals\n因为hash也会重复，hash重复但是值不一定相等，所以要使用equals进行判断\n\n三、hashmap中put方法的过程\n计算hash值， key.hashCode()>>>16，用高16位和低16位进行异或运算（二进制按位比较，如果相同则为 0，不同则为 1）。\n然后根据hash值计算出数组下标（跟数组长度进行与运算），将元素放入数组中，如果没有出现哈希冲突，则直接放入数组，如果出现哈希冲突，则以链表的方式放在链表最后（jdk1.7使用头插法，也就是放在链表最前面，jdk1.8使用了尾插法，放在了链表最后面）。\n如果链表的长度超过8，并且数组长度大于64，就把链表转成红黑树，如果链表长度低于6，就把红黑树转回链表；\n如果数组中键值对的总量超过了阈值（负载因子0.75），会进行动态扩容。\n四、负载因子是什么\n负载因子用来实现hashmap动态扩容，默认0.75是在时间和空间上折中的一个选择。\n\n扩容阈值计算公式：threshold = capacity \\* loadFactor （capacity是数组容量，初始化默认16，loadFactor是负载因子，初始化默认0.75）\n\n负载因子对hashmap的影响\n\n负载因子越大，意味着容器中元素存得越满，虽然节省了空间，但是也增加了元素哈希冲突的概率\n负载因子越小，容器中空余的位置越多，虽然减少了元素哈希冲突的概率，但也造成了大量的空间浪费\n默认的负载因子 DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR = 0.75，这是 jdk 设置的一个比较合适的负载因子，一般情况下不推荐去修改它。特殊情况下：\n\n对内存空间要求比较苛刻，而对元素查找速度要求不高，可以把负载因子调高（时间换空间）\n对程序运行速度要求苛刻，而内存空间充足的情况，可以把负载因子调低（空间换时间）\n五、hash冲突有什么解决方式\n开放定址法：当冲突发生时，使用某种探查（探测）技术再散列表中形成一个探查（探测）序列。沿此序列逐个单元的查找，直到找到给定的关键字，或者碰到一个开放的地址（地址单元为空）为止。\n\n线性探查法\n线性补偿探测法\n随机探测\n链地址法（拉链法）：将所有冲突的值，都存到同一个链表里。（HashMap就是用的这种方式）\n\n再哈希法：当发生冲突时，使用第二个、第三个…等哈希函数计算地址，一直到不冲突为止。\n\n公共溢出区：将哈希表分为基本表和溢出表两部分，凡是和基本表发生冲突的元素，都记录到溢出表。\n\n六、hashmap为什么在jdk1.8后引入了红黑树？为什么不一直使用？\n之所以引入红黑树是为了解决二分查找树的缺陷，二分查找树在特殊情况下会变成一条线性结构（这就跟原来的链表结构一样了，造成很深的问题），遍历查询会非常慢。\n\n而红黑树在插入新数据后会通过左旋、右旋、变色这些操作来保持平衡，引入红黑树就是为了查询数据快，解决链表查询深度的问题，红黑树属于平衡二叉树，但是为了保持“平衡”是要付出代价的，但是该代价所损耗的资源要比遍历线性链表要少，所以当长度大于8的时候，会使用红黑树，如果链表长度很短的话，根本不需要引入红黑树，引入反而会慢。\n\n七、为什么hashmap的容量必须是2的n次幂\n数组大小必须为 2 的 n 次幂，也就是 16、32、64….不能为其他值。因为如果不是 2 的 n 次幂，那么经过计算的数组下标会增大碰撞的几率。\n\n如果hash值的二进制是：\n10000（十进制16）\n10001（十进制17）\n10010（十进制18）\n\n和10100做&运算后（与运算，二进制按位比较，都为1结果才为1，否则为0），结果都是10000，也就是都被映射到数组16这个下标上。这三个值会以链表的形式存储在数组16下标的位置。这显然不是我们想要的结果。\n\n但如果数组长度n为2的n次幂，2进制的数值为10，100，1000，10000……n-1后对应二进制为1，11，111，1111……这样和hash值低位&后，会保留原来hash值的低位数值，那么只要hash值的低位不一样，就不会发生碰撞。\n\n同时 (n - 1) & hash 等价于 hash%n，那么为什么不直接用hash%n呢？这是因为按位的操作效率会更高。\n\n为什么不直接用 key 的 hashCode？\n其实说到底还是为了减少碰撞的概率。我们先看看 计算hash值方法中的代码做了什么事情：\n\nh ^ (h >>> 16)\n\n这个意思是把 h 的二进制数值向右移动 16 位。我们知道整形为 32 位，那么右移 16 位后，就是把高 16 位移到了低 16 位。而高 16 位清0了。\n\n^为异或操作，二进制按位比较，如果相同则为 0，不同则为 1。\n这行代码的意思就是把高低16位做异或。如果两个hashCode值的低16位相同，但是高位不同，经过如此计算，低16位会变得不一样了。\n\n为什么要把低位变得不一样呢？\n这是由于哈希表数组长度n会是偏小的数值，那么进行 (n - 1) & hash 运算时，一直使用的是hash较低位的值。那么即使hash值不同，但如果低位相当，也会发生碰撞。而进行 h ^ (h >>> 16) 加工后的hash值，让hashCode高位的值也参与了哈希运算，因此减少了碰撞的概率。\n\n八、红黑树特点\n红黑树是一种近似平衡的二叉查找树，他并非绝对平衡，但是可以保证任何一个节点的左右子树的高度差不会超过二者中较低的那个的一倍。\n\n每个节点要么是红色，要么是黑色。\n根节点必须是黑色。叶子节点必须是黑色NULL节点。\n红色节点不能连续。\n对于每个节点，从该点至叶子节点的任何路径，都含有相同个数的黑色节点。\n能够以O(log2(N))的时间复杂度进行搜索、插入、删除操作。此外,任何不平衡都会在3次旋转之内解决。\n九、hashmap扩容机制\n如果table == null, 则为HashMap的初始化, 生成空table返回即可;\n如果table不为空, 需要重新计算table的长度, newLength = oldLength << 1(注, 如果原oldLength已经到了上限, 则newLength = oldLength);\n遍历oldTable:\n\n1. 首节点为空, 本次循环结束;\n2. 无后续节点, 重新计算hash位, 本次循环结束;\n3. 当前是红黑树, 走红黑树的重定位;\n4. 当前是链表, JAVA7时还需要重新计算hash位, 但是JAVA8做了优化, 通过 (e.hash & oldCap) == 0 来判断是否需要移位; 如果为真则在原位不动, 否则则需要移动到当前 hash槽位 + oldCap 的位置;\n   再来看下 e.hash & oldCap == 0为什么可以判断当前节点是否需要移位, 而不是再次计算hash;\n\n首先我们知道 HashMap 计算 key 所对应数组下标的公式是 (length - 1) & hash，其中 length 是数组长度，hash 是 hash值，这个公式等价于 hash % length (当 length 是 2 的 n 次幂时) 。\n\n从下图中我们可以看出，hash % length 的结果只取决于小于数组长度的部分，这个 key 的 hash 值的低四位就是当前所在数组的下标。扩容后 新数组长度 = 旧数组长度 \\* 2，也就是左移 1 位，而此时 hash % length 的结果只取决于 hash 值的低五位，前后两者之间的差别就差在了第五位上。\n\n如果第五位是 0，那么只要看低四位 (也就是当前下标)；如果第五位是 1，只要把二进制数 10000+1110 ，就可以得到新数组下标。前面的部分刚好等于 旧数组长度 ，后面的部分刚好是 当前的下标 。那么我们就得出来了为什么把 low 插入扩容后 新数组\\[当前坐标\\] 的位置，把 high 插入扩容后 新数组\\[当前坐标 + 旧数组长度\\] 的位置。\n\n那为什么根据 (e.hash & oldCap) == 0 来做判断条件呢？是因为旧数组的长度 length 的二进制数的第五位刚好是 1 其它位全为 0，而 & 运算相同为 1 不同为 0，因此 hash & length 的目的就是为了计算 hash 值的第五位是 0 还是 1。\n\n源码\n\n```\n//把原链表中的元素插入到 low 和 high 链表中，依靠 (e.hash & oldCap) == 0 判断\ndo {\nnext = e.next;\nif ((e.hash & oldCap) == 0) {\n    if (loTail == null)\n        loHead = e;\n    else\n        loTail.next = e;\n    loTail = e;\n}\nelse {\n    if (hiTail == null)\n        hiHead = e;\n    else\n        hiTail.next = e;\n    hiTail = e;\n}\n\n\n//把 low 的头结点插入到当前数组下标的位置，\nif (loTail != null) {\n    loTail.next = null;\n    newTab[j] = loHead;\n}\n//把 high 的头结点插入  新数组中 [当前数组下标 + 旧数组长度] 的位置\nif (hiTail != null) {\n    hiTail.next = null;\n    newTab[j + oldCap] = hiHead;\n}\n```", "timestamp": 1654661554, "digest": "uMoFWHbTZHEJ19Iht_0wysSegU2ZFbTrCCPcxww5-H8", "contributor": "0x20ed5FBc8a97b61678b6987F16EBc6C7e167e5D8"}

After reading through the latest proposal he put forth, it’s looking likely that it will be $LUNA/$UST that dies instead. I read it multiple times & still can’t believe how he thought that was a good idea. If i was a $LUNA/$UST holder that got rekt, it feels more like a slap in the face more than anything. The only ones that stood to win from that was them. Forget about killing 2 birds with 1 stone. This was intended to kill multiple with 1/4 of a stone. Below is an excerpt from the proposal, the last 2 points in bold is mindblowing.\n\n> Token Distribution\n>\n> 1,000,000,000 Luna tokens\n>\n> 25% - Community pool, controlled by staked governanc 1% - Essential Developers emergency allocation. No lockup 4% - Essential developers (1 year cliff, 4 year vesting thereafter, granted after launch traction) 35% - All bonded / unbonded Luna, minus **TFL at “Pre-attack” snapshot** For wallets with < 1M Luna: 1 year cliff, 2 year vesting thereafter For wallets with > 1M Luna: 1 year cliff, 4 year vesting thereafter **10% - Luna holders (staking derivatives included) at the “Launch” snapshot - 10% unlocked at genesis, 90% vested over 2 years thereafter 25% - UST holders at the “Launch” snapshot - 10% unlocked at genesis, rest vested over 2 years thereafter**\n\nNot sure how i would feel if i was a $LUNA / $UST holder that got rekt, seeing people who buy & hold either right now at these prices getting rewarded for it, even if it was a small %.\n\nMy interpretation of that is, trying to incentivize new money with the promise of an airdrop. Puts buy pressure for both assets. making it a little more palatable for those that got burned hard to exit at a relatively better price. 35% of total tokens, for leeches (maybe like me) getting rewarded for basically buying at shib like prices.\n\nSo existing holders will be made partly whole & best part is, this requires nothing from TFL’s end. Who knows, maybe a good time for insiders to exit stage left as well. Talk about a great deal. oooooh weee does that sound good.\n\nThe other point, looks like a gesture of goodwill to exclude the TFL wallet, but is it really? Though Do mentioned that he sold no LUNA / UST during the debacle, its just his word against yours. remember trust but verify? Also, it almost certain that even with this insane drawdown, its safe to assume that Do (& probably team?) personally is still wealthy. **Of course, its not his personal responsibility to reimburse everyone that got rekt** but also don’t fit something in there to make it seem like it’s some big sacrifice.\n\n1 other thing to point out, the unfortunate part. is that the protocols building on terra are now, forgive my french, but fucked. everything revolved around LUNA/UST & if it goes to shit(even more than already is), they’ll have to rebuild elsewhere. but i’m already seeing a couple publicly reaching out (FTM/OSMOSIS) who will be more than happy to onboard them & im more than happy to use them if there’s value.\n\nFinally, my ****uneducated opinion**** of what will happen:\n\n*   Proposal completely backfires on him, because of the reasons i stated above.\n*   Exisiting holders who baghold it down feels insulted & just dumps it all. accepting defeat.\n*   Which then leads to even lower prices, too much for most to withstand.\n*   Puke again\n*   Trust completely decimated\n*   A mass migration of protocols\n*   Goblin town, ghost chain city\n*   The end.\n\nQuestion is, by whose hand did luna/ust die from?\n", "timestamp": 1654661271, "digest": "evHFOakOhXQa_Fsu9xQRnuofyIooqJTUQl1f3IPAngo", "contributor": "0x5f73a24771940b8c80b3570694072f606DF913cc"}

I want to tell you that this is also the place where dreams are broken. Brother Zheng said she was too pessimistic, and his girlfriend blamed him for being unrealistic. So she turned and left without even formally saying goodbye to him.\n\nFor a long time, Brother Zheng would hold her photo every day when he woke up and when he went to sleep. When he was most uncomfortable, he once ran into the snow, swallowed a few mouthfuls of cold snow, and wrote on the snow: I'm coming, coming, coming... until his fingers were frozen and unconscious.\n\nSince then, Brother Zheng has cherished his life, arranged all the time on weekdays properly, and squeezed out some time to recharge. I remember that summer when we went on a business trip together for training, when we were on the plane, brother Zheng was reading a book; after seeing clients, he went to play ball with his friends; on the street at night, when everyone was exhausted, he still went to the bookstore with great interest; when we returned to the hotel, we All fell asleep, only his bedside lamp was still on, and he was nibbling on a string of strange Italian. Before that, he was eager to learn Japanese and French.\n\nIn the end, Brother Zheng was admitted to the master and doctorate program at that prestigious school. At the celebration party, Brother Zheng still kept a low profile and still remembered his ex-girlfriend, thinking that she would come back if she was injured outside. We have long lost interest in his relationship, but we feel that over the years, Brother Zheng has gradually become a charming man, just like \"Superman\".\n\nOver the past few years, he would get up at 4:30 in the morning to read every day, and insist on running at night. In the passage of time, he suddenly lost weight from a fat man of more than 200 pounds to a handsome man, and jumped from a man with glasses in a lattice to read to the male blog.\n\nBrother Zheng is no longer as inferior as he used to be, he can stand proudly among a group of girls and talk freely; when he is sad, look at the vast and distant Milky Way galaxy and imagine that he is just a speck of dust, and that little sadness will be gone in an instant; Being confused and listening to quantum mechanics, it turns out that every cell in the body contains power and can obey the command of the mind. Most of the things that are not done are because of the lack of continuous force... In short, every messy thing, He can straighten it out very quickly. I always feel that this rare \"Superman\" is standing in our future. He is rational in his thinking and emotional in his words.\n\nBrother Zheng, who is so intelligent and knowledgeable, misses the time of struggling in the snow the most. After all, some dark nights can only be passed through alone, and some colds can only be understood by one person.\n\nBrother Zheng often said that, in fact, human time is not equal. For example, at 4:30 in the morning, most people are still having fun in their dreams, but Harvard University is already brightly lit. And the slam dunker Kobe Bryant replied to reporters that he would wake up at this time every day to play, and it would never end if he didn't make a thousand shots. This inequality will pull us further and further apart over time.\n\nI think, it is probably this kind of unequal value that pushes Brother Zheng again and again, and pushes him to another height that we can't even hope to reach!\n\nI have also read an article saying that the best rest is not to sleep, but to do other things in exchange. In fact, this is a true portrayal of hard work. If there is no spiritual support and no upward heart, how can it be possible to go so resolutely and so far?\n\nWhen we worship \"Superman\" and have full respect for the legendary brother Zheng, if we look back at the past, it is not difficult to find that they used to be just ordinary people, and they walked step by step to become who they are now. It is those unequal times that make those who work extra hard to look clear after many years, the world is bigger, and the vision is wider, because hard work is the best talent. So, don't pay too much attention to the results, learning itself is the meaning, and in this process, you have received the best gift.\n\nI have been thinking, apart from the unequal value of time, what other inequalities can make us so different. I remember when they returned from the training, everyone shouted liberation, as if they had completed a difficult exam. Those who had taken the exam said they were too lucky, and those who had not taken the exam complained that the questions were too difficult. Brother Zheng sighed in the circle of friends: the course is over, the learning has just begun, a period of time has passed, and life has to continue to work hard...\n\nThese few words from brother Zheng made me suddenly feel that people are different: the quality of starting has long since become irrelevant. The point is whether you are the one who has been running hard all your life, and whether you have realized and agreed with it. The harder you work, the luckier you get.\n\nAfterwards, it was not until Brother Zheng was sent by the company to study in the United States that we suddenly realized the gap between ourselves and a person who worked hard in silence. It turns out that the years slip away silently, in addition to taking away the boring time of some people, it can also precipitate the life of a hard worker.\n\nHearing everyone's unanimous congratulations, Brother Zheng said humbly, it's just good luck. Others may think that he was just lucky to hit a golden egg, but we who have been by his side all the time understand that Brother Zheng has tried his best to win this prize with seemingly effortless laughter. Lucky.\n\nFarewell to the airport, a male colleague said that he wanted to cry a lot. It is not that the parting scene is sentimental, but that we had the same dream and goal many years ago. When we couldn't achieve it and then laughed at our persistent self , but someone really did it, and quietly \"won the championship\" without making a sound.\n\nI suddenly remembered that when we first joined the company, we were all very keen to watch the stage shows of various speakers. After being encouraged or warmed by the enthusiasm of the speakers, most of us would still return to the original laziness. Repeatedly, there is no end. And those who have walked farther and walked more steadily than us, after embracing the enthusiasm for those three seconds, can still rely on the residual warmth to move on. Now, I understand that the residual warmth comes from the hearts of those who keep moving forward.\n\nThey know better than anyone that doing a little thing well requires hard work and patience, and more importantly, they need to take it slow;\n\nFor the rest of the time, take advantage of the good times, with enthusiasm in your heart, and move forward in the direction of your heart! I believe that the world has never owed everyone who worked hard and will remember everyone's dreams.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RhMsE4ODanU-cJkEyqvCI.jpg?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654662083, "digest": "MpG1VKoccNtf3yo5bB7RrKMn5HU-i5Zs3l20LplG0s0", "contributor": "0x675485Db534CDC3933a00837Ec8AF33b73c3bfeF"}

First of all, I have never been smooth sailing. I have a nickname among my friends called \"the survivor who has died a hundred times\". My father passed away since I was a child, and my family was so poor that I had to join the martial arts team and support the whole family with a meager monthly subsidy. Since I was 11 years old, I have won the championship of the national martial arts competition for 5 consecutive times. , but immediately, I broke my leg the next year and almost became a cripple; I finally waited for the \"Once Upon a Time\" series to be a big hit, my agent was shot by the underworld again, and my career fell into a slump again... these Not to mention, during the tsunami in Indonesia in 2004, my wife and children almost lost their lives in different places. When the flood raged right in front of you, how many people have faced that kind of inner panic and reluctance?\n\nIt is also understandable that the person who asked this question probably only knew me in the movie, and felt that I was one of those tough guys in the movie. In fact, I am just an ordinary person made of flesh and blood, and I am even more vulnerable than many people. For a period of time, I thought about becoming a monk every day.\n\nHowever, an eminent monk from the Shaolin Temple did not agree with me doing this, because becoming a monk cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Buddhists also pay attention to joining the WTO for cultivation! Later, when I went to Hollywood to develop, he asked me to remember a sentence: all difficulties are to help me become stronger!\n\nIt really doesn't sound like a blessing. Sure enough, things didn’t go smoothly when I arrived in Hollywood. Although Taiwanese boss Yang Dengkui spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help me build an image and create opportunities, the arrogant Hollywood refused to accept me, a Chinese who is only 170cm tall. I endured it until one time on the set, the director threw the script on my face and asked me coldly: Do you understand English, so the script didn't understand?\n\nThat night, I called the eminent monk. He said lightly: You have suffered a lot over the years, but when you look back and think about it, are you stronger now, or are you stronger in the past? I was stunned for a moment, thinking about my own half-life experience. Indeed, those difficulties seem to be not worth mentioning now, but at that time, why didn't I force myself to have no way to escape? It can be seen that difficulties are indeed making me stronger, at least, making me more and more bearable!\n\nSince then, I am no longer afraid of any predicament, and even hold a \"welcome\" attitude towards it both inside and outside. Friends say I am crazy, but I know in my heart that this is just cultivating myself in the midst of difficulties.\n\nDuring the filming of \"Hero\", Zhang Ziyi was criticized very much, and was even isolated by some people in the crew. In her, I saw the self who just debuted: impulsive, clear love and hatred, and there is something in my heart that I can never hide on my face... So, I told her about my experience, and slowly, she also changed from rumors She was reborn and began to show a strong Zhang Xiaomei.\n\nIn the past two years, I have become more and more interested in the way of martial arts, and I really want to share this idea with the audience, so I asked someone to write a film \"Tibetan Monk in New York\" that promotes peace. Many filmmakers are very interested in the name, but they are unwilling to invest when they see the script, because there are too few fighting scenes in it and it is not commercialized enough. Where can I find investors? Every night, this problem tortured me to the point of being unable to sleep. I really had no choice. I found the famous French director Luc Besson and wanted to make my own film. After the filming, I watched the first 90 minutes of the movie, which was wonderful and refined, but after 30 minutes I fell into the routine of a martial arts film, and I asked to change the ending. Others thought I was crazy. Changing the ending was a suicide act, which would make the box office plummet. Luc Besson also asked me in surprise: \"Do you really want to offend all your audience?\" I smiled and said, \"Then try it once.\"\n\nThe fact is that before the film was released to the public, it attracted the attention of many film experts and the media. Slowly, with the re-chasing of \"Huo Yuanjia\", everyone began to know: Oh, it turns out that Jet Li is not a martial arts machine. , he also has his own ideas; in addition to being practical, Chinese martial arts also has broad and profound things in it!\n\nThat's my purpose. It is indeed too difficult to express one's heart and guarantee the box office, but I know that difficulties will always pass, and those who experience difficulties become more optimistic and more powerful in the process.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7sF8aNfFFnRP3Y1CuXqZ.jpg?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654662349, "digest": "RwdoG5IDtfv8j1X0bLRTH5yJdAD46mHRL8jgFT7ffvQ", "contributor": "0x24dBB5171FD186E7d711F3D97436839B0eF0D67C"}

年也就是本年度年末完成 PoS 的合并（TheMerge）。截至目前，以太坊信标链 Beacon Chain 上的总质押量已经达到 1300 万枚 Ether，验证者数量也已经突破 35 万。`\n>\n> `可以说，今年是作为“公链之首”的以太坊的变革之年，与权益证明 (PoS) 的合并将是迄今为止对以太坊最深刻的技术升级，其重要性仅次于创世区块的诞生。我们相信，PoS 通过更深入地将我们联系在一起和消除权力中心及其固有的缺点，将使 Web3 社会更加繁荣。`\n>\n> `作为区块链或者说 Web3 的参与者，无论是作为开发者、矿工还是科学家等等，都有必要深入的了解此次升级所带来的影响，以及如何迅速融入升级后的 yield & defi。本文将系统的阐述 ETH1.0 到 ETH2.0 转型的始末，阐明 ETH2.0 所做出的改变内容，以及帮助参与者无缝过渡到 ETH2.0 生态中。`\n\n\n***\n\n## 01\n\n### 拂晓：ETH2.0 出现的始末\n\n### 起因：为什么要合并？\n\n以太坊的目标是成为世界级计算机，但就目前而言，以太坊仍然面临交易速度缓慢、手续费高昂、PoW 不环保等诸多问题。\n\n* 首先老生常谈的是上面提到的低扩展性。以太坊网络支持数千个去中心化应用程序，每秒都需要处理大量交易，而采用 PoW 共识机制的以太坊 1.0，每秒只能处理约 10-50 笔交易，远小于 PayPal、Visa 等中心化网络，远无法满足用户对于交易速度的需求。\n* 2020 年，DeFi Summer 促使以太坊网络上的交易量大幅增加，DappRadar 2020 Q3 Dapp 报告中指出，以太坊交易量在 2020 年第三季度猛增至 1195 亿美元，与第二季度相比增长了近 1200%。但随着而来的是网络堵塞，交易费猛增。甚至一度平均交易费用达到 14 美元的高度，刷新历史记录。所以，手续费高昂一直是以太坊被诟病的一个重要的点。包括 EOS 创始人 BM 在内的不少人感叹称：对于大多数正常规模的交易来说，以太坊交易费用太高了。\n* 同时被诟病更多的，是 PoW 的高能耗等问题。PoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、布置矿池、消耗电力来获得相应收益。根据以太坊基金会 2021 年 5 月 18 日对 Digiconomist 研究成果的援引，以太坊矿工目前每年消耗 44.49 太瓦时的电量，相当于一个小型国家一年的耗电量。\n\n### 改变：合并可以带来什么？\n\n此次以太坊的合并，是解决以太坊可扩展性问题第 0 阶段，为后续可能到来的分片做铺垫。所以，这次合并升级并不涉及扩容技术，也不会降低以太坊主网高昂的 Gas 费（这个问题需要分片链与 Layer2 技术相结合才得以有效解决）。在当前阶段，将部署信标链，验证者使用权益证明来创建区块。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F9-n_FT_hG3Jo7GCOLQjoV.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nThe Merge 后的以太坊，主要会增加以下三大特性：\n\n> **1）更公平**\n\n以太坊基金会认为，PoW（工作量证明）机制下，算力投资等级越高，硬件维护能力越高，这让大的资本相比散户来说，拥有更高的资本回报和优势；相比之下采用 PoS 机制，以太坊可以有效降低验证节点的准入门槛，任何用户只要质押 32 枚 ETH 即可加入验证者队伍（要知道 PoW 矿工的投入要远高于这个数字）。验证者的工作包括创建新区块（即矿工），以及检验新区块（未成为矿工），是由信标链随机分配的，不需要比拼算力，对硬件设备的要求大大降低，支持更多用户参与。只需一台普通的笔记本电脑以及一个可靠的、保持在线的互联网连接即可，所有质押者获得的投资回报率更平等，也由于质押者的数量更多，更去中心化。\n\n> **2）更安全**\n\nPoS 很容易从攻击中恢复。V神在《为什么要进行 PoS 》一文中论述到，在基于 GPU 挖矿的 PoW 中，攻击网络的成本仅仅是租用足够的 GPU 赶超现有矿工的成本，只需要花费少量的成本和时间就可以进行攻击工作。比如 ASIC 芯片挖矿需要 1/3 的持续成本(包括更新迭代硬件、维护、电力)和约 2/3 的资本成本。据计算，需要 487 美元左右。ASIC 以高昂的集中化成本提高安全级别，但这种高成本防范攻击使得整个网络趋于中心化，因为矿工加入的门槛也变高了。而在权益证明中，几乎全部是资本成本，即运行节点的成本。随着质押率的提高，攻击成本预计非常高，V神个人预计这个数字最终会上升到 10000 美元左右。\n\n在 PoW 网络中，如果遭到 51% 攻击，唯一的应对措施就是 “等到攻击者主动撤销攻击\"。但这忽略了一种更危险的攻击可能性，这种攻击叫做产卵营攻击(Pawn Camping Attack)，攻击者一次又一次地进行攻击，目的很明确，就是为了使整条链瘫痪。PoS 的情况会好很多。对于某些类型的 51% 攻击(特别是回滚最终确定的区块)，在权益证明中有一个内置的惩罚机制，通过这个机制，攻击者的大部分质押(并不包括其他人的)将被自动销毁。\n\n同时，此次合并升级也正是为最后的分片链上线做准备。分片链的安全性将影响着整个以太坊网络，所以只有当安全性得到有效保障后，才能逐渐上线，分片链的验证者将由信标链随机分配，因为是随机的，所以一条分片链上的验证者难以进行串谋作恶，据以太坊团队介绍，该作恶的可能性小于万亿分之一，分片链的安全得以保障。\n\n> **3）更节能**\n\nPoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、电力和矿池，这导致了对于能源的较大消耗，转化成 PoS 机制后，能够节约超过 95% 的能源消耗，原因是以太坊给质押者的收益只需要消耗少量的网络和电力费用。在全球减碳环保的大背景下，选择不消耗任何能源的 PoS 机制更符合以太坊网络可持续性发展的愿景。\n\n\n***\n\n## 02\n\n### 深入：从矿工到验证者\n\n### 验证者：ETH2.0 中的矿工\n\n在 ETH2.0 中，“矿工”将被“验证者” (validators) 取代，这些验证者需要将 ETH 存入某个以太坊智能合约中 (这一过程称为“质押”(staking))。验证者质押的 ETH 将作为抵押品，以激励他们正确地完成验证工作。不履行验证工作 (比如因为离线) 或进行恶意行为的验证者，将导致其质押的 ETH 的一部分被销毁。另一方面，如果验证者行为得当，那么将会获得 ETH 奖励。\n\n事实上，一个交易被敲定的过程要求验证者进行的“证明”(attestations) 实际上要比上文阐述的要更复杂一些。有两种类型的证明：一种是 LMD GHOST 投票，用于证明区块链的链头；第二种最为重要，是用于对两个检查点进行证明的 FFG 投票 (对区块链进行合理化和最终敲定)。如果验证者接收到的区块是有效的，那么验证者将对区块进行“证明”，实际上就是投票支持将该区块添加到区块链中。一个节点将不定期地被要求提议一个新区块，其他验证者将“证明”该区块。当区块链有多个分叉时，只有那条在其历史上积累了最多“证明” 的链才是正确的区块链。\n\n所有验证者都会对每个检查点进行 FFG 投票，而只有一个随机选中的验证者子集在每个 slot (将区块添加到信标链的机会，每 12 秒出现一次)进行 LMD GHOST 投票。\n\n此外，验证者还将不定期地参与到某个同步委员会 (sync committee) 中，同步委员会是一个由随机选择的 512 名验证者组成的小组，这些被随机选中的验证者将对区块头 (block headers) 进行签名，这样轻客户端就可以检索这些被验证过的区块，而无需访问整条历史链或整个验证者集。\n\n### 验证者参与结果：质押奖励、惩罚和罚没\n\n> **1）奖励**\n\n验证者需要质押的 ETH 用于作为“抵押品”，以激励验证者的诚实行为。随着验证者因为参与到保护网络中而获得奖励，这些被质押的 ETH 将随着时间的推移而增加。当确定验证者的投票合法并有效、且与大多数其他验证者一致时，那么验证者就会获得证明奖励。\n\n当验证者被选中作为“区块提议者”(block proposer) 时，如果其提议的区块被“敲定”， 那么该验证者也将获得奖励。区块提议者也可以通过将有关其他验证者行为不当的证明打包进自己提议的区块中，从而增加自己获得的奖励。\n\n> **2）惩罚**\n\n验证者可能受到的“惩罚”是以各种机制的形式来销毁一部分验证者质押的 ETH。当验证者未能提交一个 FFG 投票、提交延迟了或者提交了错误的 FFG 投票时，都会受到证明惩罚 (attestation penalties)。验证者余额被削减的数额，等同于如果他们提交正确的证明而本可以获得的奖励数额。这意味着，一个诚实但“懒惰”的验证者，他因为错过了证明而遭受到的最大惩罚，就是损失他如果以完美的方式进行证明时本可以获得的奖励金额的 3/4。注意，如果不参与 LMD GHOST 验证是不会受到惩罚的，只是无法得到相应的奖励。\n\n此外，当验证者被分配至“同步委员会”(sync committee) 时，如果该验证者未能签名区块，那么其受到的惩罚将等同于如果他成功地签名区块时本可以获得的 ETH 价值。\n\n> **3）罚没**\n\n罚没 (slashing) 是一种更严重的行为，这会导致验证者被强制从网络中移除，并导致相关的 ETH 质押金损失。\n\n如果检测到严重的违规操作操作，验证者就会罚没。这意味着相当于其质押的 ETH 的 1/64 (最高可达 0.5 ETH) 将立即被销毁，然后进行一个为期 36 天的移除。在此期间，验证者的质押金将逐渐被削减；且在这段期间的中间点 (第18天)，该验证者还将受到额外的惩罚，惩罚大小将与此次罚没事件发生之前的 36 天内所有被罚没的验证者的 ETH 质押总额成比例。\n\n这意味着，当更多的验证者被罚没时，此次罚没的量级将会增加。最大的罚没是所有被罚没的验证者的全部有效余额 (比如，如果有大量验证者被罚没，那么某个验证者可能损失其全部的质押金)。\n\n\n***\n\n## 03\n\n### 浅出：不同参与者如何玩转 ETH2.0\n\n### 对开发者：无缝过渡\n\n在以太坊上工作的开发人员可以“高枕无忧”，因为用于合并前后架构的通用 API 以及对现有组件（如以太坊执行客户端 Geth）的重用，将确保无缝过渡的不间断开发体验。这意味着现有应用程序的返工率很低甚至没有。\n\nPoW 和 PoS 接口的相似之处意味着无需更改 API。利用现有组件还可以确保无需重写智能合约或 dapp 或迁移基础设施。对于依赖随机操作码的 Dapp，可能需要更新一些基础设施。如果您是以太坊开发人员并希望提前开始测试您的 Dapp 和基础设施，鼓励使用最近推出的 Kiln 测试网来进行。增加的客户端选择和灵活性将允许开发人员混合和匹配以满足他们的需求，例如在执行层使用轻量级客户端和在共识层使用重量级 Staking 客户端。\n\n迁移到 PoS 还意味着更可预测的区块时间和费用，这将减少在设计 12 秒区块时间和使用 EIP-1559 建立的 base 费用的高流量解决方案时的不确定性。\n\n### 对普通 Web3 玩家：质押挖矿\n\n在完全切换共识后，以太坊的增发率会低至 2% 以下，增发会远低于目前。PoS 共识下的挖矿和理财比较相近，长期稳定下来的年化收益率预期在 10% 以下，传统矿工一年回本、两年翻倍的模式将不复存在。\n\n可能很多玩家会说，质押 32 ETH 的门槛太高，会导致大部分 PoW 矿工无法参与其中。常言道，有求必有应，需求驱动供给的产生，诸如 Lido 等 Dapp 可以从门槛上进一步降低参与者的准入条件。如今 Lido 的 TVL 已达 195 亿美元，在 DeFi 项目 TVL 总榜中稳居第二，仅次于 Curve。\n\n\n***\n\n**最后**\n\n根据 Bankless 以太坊第一季度报告，仅在 EIP1559 燃烧情况下，ETH 通胀率从 1.10% 下降 至 0.51%。按照目前的质押率，仅考虑转换 PoS，通胀率为 0.5-1% 左右，低于比特币的通胀率。两者叠加，ETH 既有可能进入通缩状态，将利好 ETH 价格。\n\n合并过程或许不会一切顺利。首先合并后 PoW 矿机节点将全部下线，许多矿工可能会在合并之前退出网络，合并发生后也极有可能出现分叉。其次，如此重大的技术升级，也可能出现服务错误和黑客攻击。\n\n在过去几年中，我们看到以太坊引领了 DeFi、NFT 等创新趋势，同时以太坊在提升性能方面从未停止脚步，PoS 合并会是这一进程中的重要一步。在元宇宙叙事的 Web3.0 下，以太坊是否能保持龙头公链的地位，建立一个更强壮的体验与生态，引入更多用户的参与，期待以太坊生态会有更好的表现。\n\n\n***\n\n**参考**\n\n<https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/state-of-ethereum-q1-2022?s=r>[https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PNXIzQdaMmLMyn7f7WMeuw](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUyNzE4MDM2MA==&mid=2247517370&idx=1&sn=b8e003a93fd2b4ad7bdfb78ec74399c9&scene=21#wechat_redirect)\n\n\n***\n\n**END**\n\n· **关于 SnapFingers

{"id": "gd9XWDNaQmw2h-0eBaS9PRt74IwQsIaqWrhXQXINSIk", "title": "Anti-epidemic", "body": "At the beginning of 2020, the start is really difficult. Locust plagues are spreading around the world, African swine fever, new crown pneumonia are sweeping the world, and Australian wildfires. But most of them have nothing to do with me. Except for the increase in pork prices and the infrequent eating of pork, it should be an ordinary 2020 for me. When the new crown pneumonia occurred, I think it should be over soon. Now the country's medical facilities are much better than before, and it will not cause social panic like SARS in 2003. But it backfired, and the number of infections and deaths increased rapidly, and it also spread around the world, becoming a virus that spreads worldwide.\n\nThe rapid and ferocity of the virus caused global panic, but China quickly stabilized its position and implemented the unprecedented emergency measures such as the closure of Wuhan, which brought the epidemic under control in a short period of time and then spread widely. As far as this time is concerned, the response capability of the Chinese government has been very good. The response speed and capability of the national health system are also the best in the world. In comparison, other countries are dwarfed. For example, the United States, one catches a cold and dies. thousands of people.\n\nIn this fight against the epidemic, many ordinary heroes have emerged. As Mr. Lu Xun said, \"Since ancient times, we have had people who worked hard, those who worked hard, those who asked for their lives for the people, and those who sacrificed their lives to seek the law... They are the backbone of the nation.\" It is not clear that people who \"work hard\" and \"work hard\" include celebrities like Zhong Nanshan who have experienced two epidemics, and martyrs like Li Wenliang who were posthumously awarded the \"May 4th Medal for Youth in China\", but still There are many people we don't know who are also on the front line of the disaster. They may not be known, but they all have their own careers, their own families, and their families and children are praying for them. They are heroes of the fight against the epidemic and national Backbone, salute them.\n\nUnder the global epidemic, the epidemic is ruthless, and people have feelings. In a situation where Western countries are in a panic, China perfectly interprets that there is a kind of power called Chinese power, a speed called China speed, and a spirit called Chinese spirit. When one side is in difficulty, all parties support, and go all out to overcome the difficulties together. The whole country is fighting the epidemic together, united as one, constantly transporting medicines and substances to the front line, and constantly supporting the medical staff on the front line. At this moment, the people of the whole country are twisted together. The miracles of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital show what is called the speed of China, but in fact, there is no such thing as speed and miracles, there are only the most ordinary Chinese workers who are dying. Under the world epidemic, although the domestic epidemic has not yet ended, China still provides a large amount of aid materials to countries around the world, and also sends medical teams to the front line of the fight against the epidemic, showing the world the responsibility of a major country and the spirit of China.\n\nAfter this epidemic, there is also the fact that, except for smallpox, human beings have never eliminated any virus. Yuval Harari, the author of \"A Brief History of the World\", once said that there are three major disasters in human history: hunger, war and plague. These three disasters have run through the entire human development process, and have been experienced by all human beings in the past 100 years. Over the past 100 years, whether it is Spanish flu, bird flu, SARS, or Ebola virus, they have come to the world like a ghost to toss, and then human beings have tried their best to drive it away, but it has never Disappeared, maybe it reappeared that day. So disaster is very close to us, no one knows which will come first tomorrow or accident, but happiness is not far from us. As long as we are united and united, what cannot defeat us will only make us stronger.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qZeDxLl8SqEVjLXoqiDmk.jpg?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654662917, "digest": "LJBvLDLvffWfQgSsuaeaSvaFbSxt4UxLilW-xgcvuhQ", "contributor": "0x992DD87a55DB64ce3E2810fb241107Fa5fA75406"}

He found that the boy was kicking like that, so he offered to give him a football.

ETH2.0 生态中。`\n\n\n***\n\n## 01\n\n### 拂晓：ETH2.0 出现的始末\n\n### 起因：为什么要合并？\n\n以太坊的目标是成为世界级计算机，但就目前而言，以太坊仍然面临交易速度缓慢、手续费高昂、PoW 不环保等诸多问题。\n\n* 首先老生常谈的是上面提到的低扩展性。以太坊网络支持数千个去中心化应用程序，每秒都需要处理大量交易，而采用 PoW 共识机制的以太坊 1.0，每秒只能处理约 10-50 笔交易，远小于 PayPal、Visa 等中心化网络，远无法满足用户对于交易速度的需求。\n* 2020 年，DeFi Summer 促使以太坊网络上的交易量大幅增加，DappRadar 2020 Q3 Dapp 报告中指出，以太坊交易量在 2020 年第三季度猛增至 1195 亿美元，与第二季度相比增长了近 1200%。但随着而来的是网络堵塞，交易费猛增。甚至一度平均交易费用达到 14 美元的高度，刷新历史记录。所以，手续费高昂一直是以太坊被诟病的一个重要的点。包括 EOS 创始人 BM 在内的不少人感叹称：对于大多数正常规模的交易来说，以太坊交易费用太高了。\n* 同时被诟病更多的，是 PoW 的高能耗等问题。PoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、布置矿池、消耗电力来获得相应收益。根据以太坊基金会 2021 年 5 月 18 日对 Digiconomist 研究成果的援引，以太坊矿工目前每年消耗 44.49 太瓦时的电量，相当于一个小型国家一年的耗电量。\n\n### 改变：合并可以带来什么？\n\n此次以太坊的合并，是解决以太坊可扩展性问题第 0 阶段，为后续可能到来的分片做铺垫。所以，这次合并升级并不涉及扩容技术，也不会降低以太坊主网高昂的 Gas 费（这个问题需要分片链与 Layer2 技术相结合才得以有效解决）。在当前阶段，将部署信标链，验证者使用权益证明来创建区块。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F9-n_FT_hG3Jo7GCOLQjoV.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nThe Merge 后的以太坊，主要会增加以下三大特性：\n\n> **1）更公平**\n\n以太坊基金会认为，PoW（工作量证明）机制下，算力投资等级越高，硬件维护能力越高，这让大的资本相比散户来说，拥有更高的资本回报和优势；相比之下采用 PoS 机制，以太坊可以有效降低验证节点的准入门槛，任何用户只要质押 32 枚 ETH 即可加入验证者队伍（要知道 PoW 矿工的投入要远高于这个数字）。验证者的工作包括创建新区块（即矿工），以及检验新区块（未成为矿工），是由信标链随机分配的，不需要比拼算力，对硬件设备的要求大大降低，支持更多用户参与。只需一台普通的笔记本电脑以及一个可靠的、保持在线的互联网连接即可，所有质押者获得的投资回报率更平等，也由于质押者的数量更多，更去中心化。\n\n> **2）更安全**\n\nPoS 很容易从攻击中恢复。V神在《为什么要进行 PoS 》一文中论述到，在基于 GPU 挖矿的 PoW 中，攻击网络的成本仅仅是租用足够的 GPU 赶超现有矿工的成本，只需要花费少量的成本和时间就可以进行攻击工作。比如 ASIC 芯片挖矿需要 1/3 的持续成本(包括更新迭代硬件、维护、电力)和约 2/3 的资本成本。据计算，需要 487 美元左右。ASIC 以高昂的集中化成本提高安全级别，但这种高成本防范攻击使得整个网络趋于中心化，因为矿工加入的门槛也变高了。而在权益证明中，几乎全部是资本成本，即运行节点的成本。随着质押率的提高，攻击成本预计非常高，V神个人预计这个数字最终会上升到 10000 美元左右。\n\n在 PoW 网络中，如果遭到 51% 攻击，唯一的应对措施就是 “等到攻击者主动撤销攻击\"。但这忽略了一种更危险的攻击可能性，这种攻击叫做产卵营攻击(Pawn Camping Attack)，攻击者一次又一次地进行攻击，目的很明确，就是为了使整条链瘫痪。PoS 的情况会好很多。对于某些类型的 51% 攻击(特别是回滚最终确定的区块)，在权益证明中有一个内置的惩罚机制，通过这个机制，攻击者的大部分质押(并不包括其他人的)将被自动销毁。\n\n同时，此次合并升级也正是为最后的分片链上线做准备。分片链的安全性将影响着整个以太坊网络，所以只有当安全性得到有效保障后，才能逐渐上线，分片链的验证者将由信标链随机分配，因为是随机的，所以一条分片链上的验证者难以进行串谋作恶，据以太坊团队介绍，该作恶的可能性小于万亿分之一，分片链的安全得以保障。\n\n> **3）更节能**\n\nPoW 机制下，矿工需要购买矿机硬件、电力和矿池，这导致了对于能源的较大消耗，转化成 PoS 机制后，能够节约超过 95% 的能源消耗，原因是以太坊给质押者的收益只需要消耗少量的网络和电力费用。在全球减碳环保的大背景下，选择不消耗任何能源的 PoS 机制更符合以太坊网络可持续性发展的愿景。\n\n\n***\n\n## 02\n\n### 深入：从矿工到验证者\n\n### 验证者：ETH2.0 中的矿工\n\n在 ETH2.0 中，“矿工”将被“验证者” (validators) 取代，这些验证者需要将 ETH 存入某个以太坊智能合约中 (这一过程称为“质押”(staking))。验证者质押的 ETH 将作为抵押品，以激励他们正确地完成验证工作。不履行验证工作 (比如因为离线) 或进行恶意行为的验证者，将导致其质押的 ETH 的一部分被销毁。另一方面，如果验证者行为得当，那么将会获得 ETH 奖励。\n\n事实上，一个交易被敲定的过程要求验证者进行的“证明”(attestations) 实际上要比上文阐述的要更复杂一些。有两种类型的证明：一种是 LMD GHOST 投票，用于证明区块链的链头；第二种最为重要，是用于对两个检查点进行证明的 FFG 投票 (对区块链进行合理化和最终敲定)。如果验证者接收到的区块是有效的，那么验证者将对区块进行“证明”，实际上就是投票支持将该区块添加到区块链中。一个节点将不定期地被要求提议一个新区块，其他验证者将“证明”该区块。当区块链有多个分叉时，只有那条在其历史上积累了最多“证明” 的链才是正确的区块链。\n\n所有验证者都会对每个检查点进行 FFG 投票，而只有一个随机选中的验证者子集在每个 slot (将区块添加到信标链的机会，每 12 秒出现一次)进行 LMD GHOST 投票。\n\n此外，验证者还将不定期地参与到某个同步委员会 (sync committee) 中，同步委员会是一个由随机选择的 512 名验证者组成的小组，这些被随机选中的验证者将对区块头 (block headers) 进行签名，这样轻客户端就可以检索这些被验证过的区块，而无需访问整条历史链或整个验证者集。\n\n### 验证者参与结果：质押奖励、惩罚和罚没\n\n> **1）奖励**\n\n验证者需要质押的 ETH 用于作为“抵押品”，以激励验证者的诚实行为。随着验证者因为参与到保护网络中而获得奖励，这些被质押的 ETH 将随着时间的推移而增加。当确定验证者的投票合法并有效、且与大多数其他验证者一致时，那么验证者就会获得证明奖励。\n\n当验证者被选中作为“区块提议者”(block proposer) 时，如果其提议的区块被“敲定”， 那么该验证者也将获得奖励。区块提议者也可以通过将有关其他验证者行为不当的证明打包进自己提议的区块中，从而增加自己获得的奖励。\n\n> **2）惩罚**\n\n验证者可能受到的“惩罚”是以各种机制的形式来销毁一部分验证者质押的 ETH。当验证者未能提交一个 FFG 投票、提交延迟了或者提交了错误的 FFG 投票时，都会受到证明惩罚 (attestation penalties)。验证者余额被削减的数额，等同于如果他们提交正确的证明而本可以获得的奖励数额。这意味着，一个诚实但“懒惰”的验证者，他因为错过了证明而遭受到的最大惩罚，就是损失他如果以完美的方式进行证明时本可以获得的奖励金额的 3/4。注意，如果不参与 LMD GHOST 验证是不会受到惩罚的，只是无法得到相应的奖励。\n\n此外，当验证者被分配至“同步委员会”(sync committee) 时，如果该验证者未能签名区块，那么其受到的惩罚将等同于如果他成功地签名区块时本可以获得的 ETH 价值。\n\n> **3）罚没**\n\n罚没 (slashing) 是一种更严重的行为，这会导致验证者被强制从网络中移除，并导致相关的 ETH 质押金损失。\n\n如果检测到严重的违规操作操作，验证者就会罚没。这意味着相当于其质押的 ETH 的 1/64 (最高可达 0.5 ETH) 将立即被销毁，然后进行一个为期 36 天的移除。在此期间，验证者的质押金将逐渐被削减；且在这段期间的中间点 (第18天)，该验证者还将受到额外的惩罚，惩罚大小将与此次罚没事件发生之前的 36 天内所有被罚没的验证者的 ETH 质押总额成比例。\n\n这意味着，当更多的验证者被罚没时，此次罚没的量级将会增加。最大的罚没是所有被罚没的验证者的全部有效余额 (比如，如果有大量验证者被罚没，那么某个验证者可能损失其全部的质押金)。\n\n\n***\n\n## 03\n\n### 浅出：不同参与者如何玩转 ETH2.0\n\n### 对开发者：无缝过渡\n\n在以太坊上工作的开发人员可以“高枕无忧”，因为用于合并前后架构的通用 API 以及对现有组件（如以太坊执行客户端 Geth）的重用，将确保无缝过渡的不间断开发体验。这意味着现有应用程序的返工率很低甚至没有。\n\nPoW 和 PoS 接口的相似之处意味着无需更改 API。利用现有组件还可以确保无需重写智能合约或 dapp 或迁移基础设施。对于依赖随机操作码的 Dapp，可能需要更新一些基础设施。如果您是以太坊开发人员并希望提前开始测试您的 Dapp 和基础设施，鼓励使用最近推出的 Kiln 测试网来进行。增加的客户端选择和灵活性将允许开发人员混合和匹配以满足他们的需求，例如在执行层使用轻量级客户端和在共识层使用重量级 Staking 客户端。\n\n迁移到 PoS 还意味着更可预测的区块时间和费用，这将减少在设计 12 秒区块时间和使用 EIP-1559 建立的 base 费用的高流量解决方案时的不确定性。\n\n### 对普通 Web3 玩家：质押挖矿\n\n在完全切换共识后，以太坊的增发率会低至 2% 以下，增发会远低于目前。PoS 共识下的挖矿和理财比较相近，长期稳定下来的年化收益率预期在 10% 以下，传统矿工一年回本、两年翻倍的模式将不复存在。\n\n可能很多玩家会说，质押 32 ETH 的门槛太高，会导致大部分 PoW 矿工无法参与其中。常言道，有求必有应，需求驱动供给的产生，诸如 Lido 等 Dapp 可以从门槛上进一步降低参与者的准入条件。如今 Lido 的 TVL 已达 195 亿美元，在 DeFi 项目 TVL 总榜中稳居第二，仅次于 Curve。\n\n\n***\n\n**最后**\n\n根据 Bankless 以太坊第一季度报告，仅在 EIP1559 燃烧情况下，ETH 通胀率从 1.10% 下降 至 0.51%。按照目前的质押率，仅考虑转换 PoS，通胀率为 0.5-1% 左右，低于比特币的通胀率。两者叠加，ETH 既有可能进入通缩状态，将利好 ETH 价格。\n\n合并过程或许不会一切顺利。首先合并后 PoW 矿机节点将全部下线，许多矿工可能会在合并之前退出网络，合并发生后也极有可能出现分叉。其次，如此重大的技术升级，也可能出现服务错误和黑客攻击。\n\n在过去几年中，我们看到以太坊引领了 DeFi、NFT 等创新趋势，同时以太坊在提升性能方面从未停止脚步，PoS 合并会是这一进程中的重要一步。在元宇宙叙事的 Web3.0 下，以太坊是否能保持龙头公链的地位，建立一个更强壮的体验与生态，引入更多用户的参与，期待以太坊生态会有更好的表现。\n\n\n***\n\n**参考**\n\n<https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/state-of-ethereum-q1-2022?s=r>[https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PNXIzQdaMmLMyn7f7WMeuw](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUyNzE4MDM2MA==&mid=2247517370&idx=1&sn=b8e003a93fd2b4ad7bdfb78ec74399c9&scene=21#wechat_redirect)\n\n\n***\n\n**END**\n\n· **关于 SnapFingers

{"id": "towVlIuUHXz6YkTYFvuCFmNkTWMXe37eUTh0P7R1rFY", "title": "DeFi 去风险：分析去中心化系统中的系统性风险", "body": "**从来没有避免金融灾难的万能方法。**\n\n在不可预测的社会中，系统性风险被只能部分处理。经济条件、技术和人类行为都会随着时间而变化，因此应对系统性风险的方法也必须保持可变。这种发展不一定会带来更有效和更稳定的状态，因为它会不断受到创新、监管行动、金融市场参与者不断变化的心理模式和行为的影响。在传统金融和去中心化金融中都是如此。\n\n\\*\\*我们将系统性风险定义为：相互关联的代理网络中的风险，其中一个或多个代理造成的痛苦可传播给网络中的其他几个代理，从而产生广泛的危机。系统性风险传统上与制度失灵有关。\\*\\*其中，违约可能导致资本成本的催化性增加，银行挤兑就是一个例子，这会使得银行被迫破产。由于银行经常相互借贷，违约行为可能会引发多米诺骨牌效应。\n\n一般来说，有3种情况被认为是系统性风险。\n\n* **信息传染——储户对危机可能性的预期导致银行挤兑。**\n* **直接传染——通过银行间层面和系统产生的债务/信用关系等金融联系，或公司间信用链等其他风险敞口传播。**\n* **共同风险——资产价值下降，风险在于持有相同或相关资产的代理人。**\n\n## 传染图理论\n\n让我们从图论的角度分析默认传染的影响。如果额外的链接有助于在网络中的节点之间分配与它们的吸收能力成比例的损失流，那么就抵御传染的能力而言，网络将变得更加健壮。只有在以下非常严格的要求下，才能保证轻微的特殊冲击，才能保证连通性的有利效果：\n\n1. 损失流在网络N上展开，沿着有向树\n\n2）所有节点具有相同的吸收能力和向外扩张能力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3NvBjR87FGspB6WDELgjH.png?height=198&width=600)\n\n在上图中，特异性冲击击中虚线的起始节点。链接的添加对以前未触及的网络部分造成了一些损害。因此，损失的负担由更多的节点承担，从而减少了流量对每个单个节点的影响。但是，如果影响太大，则增加的连接性会导致连级故障。\n\n在闭合路径和循环中，网络会产生不均匀的损失分配。\n\n![闭合路径情况](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/61v-e2WOaDFxzO1Ig2XHA.png?height=353&width=600)\n\n将 B 连接到 E 的虚线创建了一条闭合路径，使 E 承载损失，同时减少可能流向 C 和 D 的流量。如果 C、D 和 E 具有相同的吸收能力，则虚线的作用使系统能够更好地处理传染。\n\n同样的原因也适用于循环路径。在下图中，虚线创建了 A => B => D => A 的循环，损失减少到 E。\n\n![循环路径情况](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XrS5d0o3PycCvc-I0crlN.png?height=360&width=600)\n\n因此，连接度低的网络更可能是树状网络，而连接度高的网络更可能是循环和闭合路径。更高程度的连通性导致借贷行为更加多样化。将链接添加到具有高度连通性的网络会增加循环和封闭路径的数量，因此会降低去中心化多样性的好处。因此，当网络的连通性达到顶峰时，多样化的好处也得到了最大化。\n\n基于以上情况，我们可以提出一个理论：\n\n**在有向链路数量与节点数量比例较低的网络中，连接将会增加。对传染最具弹性的网络结构，则是具有最高连接可能性的网络结构。**\n\n![显示高阶网络对银行所经历的最大冲击的影响](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4jZsBi5dtlckMp-mBjOlA.png?height=349&width=600)\n\n为了展示高阶网络与所经历的最小/最大冲击之间的关系，我们使用传统的银行网络来模拟市场冲击和传染事件，其灵感来自Stuart Gordon Reid。我们创建了一个包含大约 50 家银行的银行间网络模型。然后我们统一生成一个介于 50 到 2500 之间的随机数来表示网络中的连接数（节点是随机选择的）。当连接数等于 50 时，每个 bank 仅连接到另一个 bank。理论上，当连接数等于 2500 时，所有 bank 都是互连的。\n\n创建网络后，模拟对系统的冲击并观察传染传播。随着冲击通过网络传播，冲击的影响与连接到每家银行的邻居数量成正比。\n\n这些图表有助于可视化趋势并且已经过平滑处理。从这个初步的实验中，我们可以看到网络规模的增加与网络稳定性的整体增加呈正相关，但在某个点之后，稳定性会恶化。这是相当直观的，因为完全连接的网络最容易受到系统性风险传染的影响。这是一些方面，也可以转化为加密网络，每个验证节点代表每个银行节点，尽管这个模型非常简单。\n\n![显示高阶网络对银行所经历的最小冲击的影响](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/13mnj5k7dg3NCCIKGr95r.png?height=334&width=600)\n\n## 区块链环境中的系统性风险\n\n到目前为止，我们只讨论了广义节点网络的系统性风险，这些风险可以归因于各种网络，宏观和微观等。但是，系统性风险只会随着系统变得更加复杂而增加。区块链技术已经从根本上改变了衍生品的市场结构。相比之下，中央交易对手通过创建容易失败的大型实体来创造风险。区块链去中心化清算功能可以降低过度中心化带来的风险。理想的基于区块链的系统将清算功能去中心化，并将这些任务分配给网络成员，而不会造成不平等的压力。\n\n让我们考虑一个去中心化清算系统，它通过默认传染来减轻系统性风险。实际清算功能的主要挑战是确定可用资金和解决对支付资历的分歧。在区块链清算机制中，这两个问题是自动解决的，而不是通过中介，从而减少了摩擦。因此，区块链系统既提高了违约资产的回收率，又增加了银行对风险交易的责任。\n\n唉，我们发现自己在重复一句古老的格言：闪光的不是金子。由于对中心化治理形式不可避免的需求，以及共识机制具有具体权力的趋势，区块链系统只有一种去中心化的错觉。**由于高杠杆和流动性不匹配，DeFi 尤其表现出许多漏洞。在某些应用中，如果发生冲击，内置的互连性会导致级联故障的可能性很高。**\n\n![DeFi 和 CeFi 在加密领域的主要区别在于，金融服务是通过智能合约实现自动化，还是由中心化中介机构处理以及稳定币设计的处理](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XFTt9ibtWO0nAukLxYpzr.png?height=424&width=600)\n\n## 系统性风险缓解\n\n预言机系统是智能合约的喉舌，这经常被认为是一个关键的故障点。可以在流行的去中心化预言机服务 Chainlink 中找到最好地检验这一主张的案例研究。\n\nChainlink 通过三管齐下的方法有效地将我们的理论应用于风险效率高的去中心化系统：\n\n1. 分布式数据源\n2. 分布式预言机\n3. 使用受信任的硬件。\n\n我们现在将更仔细地研究分布式预言机如何帮助使其成为一个传染性风险容忍系统。\n\nChainlink 构建了一个模块化而非单一的系统，以确保风险不会集中在一个预言机中。这将创建n 个不同的预言机节点 { O 1 , O 2 , ..., O n } 的集合，每个预言机都联系自己不同的数据集源。\n\nChainlink 防止级联故障的最佳方法之一是防止预言机相互复制。想象一个预言机O z 观察另一个预言机O i的响应并复制它。这可能会通过减少数据源的多样性导致安全性减弱，从而导致整个系统产生错误的响应。Chainlink 通过提交/显示算法避免了这种情况。下面的算法显示了一个保证可用性的协议，给定 3 f + 1 个节点。只有在做出所有承诺之后，Oracle 响应才会重新提交，并暴露于潜在的复制中。这排除了作弊预言机复制另一个预言机的响应。\n\n![来源：chainlink白皮书](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_B63atgzWPtmVg9ni1W14.png?height=217&width=600)\n\n给定总共 3f + 1 个节点，最多f将有缺陷，这意味着至少有 2 f + 1 将在步骤 4 中发送承诺。这些承诺中最多f来自有问题的节点，因此至少有f + 1 来来自可信赖的节点。由于单个值A上的至少一个f + 1 承诺必须来自诚实节点，因此很明显，A或聚合响应将作为算法的结果是准确的。\n\n在认识到可能存在故障节点的同时，难以就值A达成共识，这类似于拜占庭将军的问题。\n\n## 缺乏共识是系统性风险\n\n拜占庭容错（BFT）共识协议是拜占庭式的解决方案。\n\n拜占庭将军问题，由Lamport、Shostak 和 Pease在 1982 年提出。该问题指出，有一支军队散布在城市周围，由一名将军和 n-1 名中尉组成。军队正准备攻击一个共同的敌人，但尚未决定何时发动攻击。只有全军同时冲锋，攻击才会成功。通过来回发送信号，将军和他的副手必须就最佳打击时机达成一致。然而，有些副官是叛徒，这意味着他们可以对自己的决定撒谎。\n\n拜占庭将军的问题与区块链问题类似，网络（将军和他的副手）必须就广播交易（攻击的时间）达成一致，即使某些节点不可靠（副手背叛）。拜占庭容错是系统的一种属性，它允许容忍来自拜占庭将军问题的给定数量的故障，从而降低通信故障的风险。\n\n传统的金融系统不是 BFT 系统。TradFi 仍然成为不诚实或错误信息输入的牺牲品，因此，灾难接踵而至。这个问题是如此普遍，以至于墙上的一个裂缝最终可能升级为整个房子的破坏，可以这么说。\n\n## 如何保障未来\n\n改善 DeFi 的底层基础设施，需要公共监管机构和私营部门参与者的广泛努力。过去，监管倾向于将两者结合起来，更全面的政府监管时期源于系统性危机，或私营部门未能执行自我强加的标准。\n\n一般而言，自我监管在限制危机和保护客户方面越有效，国家监管就越难获得政治支持。因此，整个 DeFi 监管框架将受到私营部门自我监管举措的类型和有效性的重大影响。风险保险公司、DeFi 服务提供商和最终用户都将从系统安全水平的提高中受益，这会产生很多激励机制。保险提供商已经在指导智能合约安全最佳实践方面做出了贡献，但是，深思熟虑的尝试永远是有空间的，开发保险产品，开发标准和技术以降低灾难性的可能性事件及其附带损害都是值得的。\n\n最后，**与传统金融相比，更高程度的数字化、透明度、自动化和拜占庭容错是 DeFi 在缓解系统性风险方面的主要技术优势**。去中心化清算功能并以成比例的方式在网络成员之间分配这些杂务（即：定向链接≤节点）是理想的基于区块链的风险缓解解决方案。DeFi 中使用的开源代码和可公开验证的账本越多，就越容易构建自动化风险模拟、压力测试、监控、预警信号、断路器、保险范围、索赔处理、报告和其他集成形式的风险管理。", "timestamp": 1654662810, "digest": "ENm4vJM4Ndn72fEP1zbqtatU8CFBb3eVOyqFexvJWsI", "contributor": "0x31d61b448700D321536FF36A2cd299a1dea14CA2"}

{"id": "3Snx8q6CijNZ6M7pNRqHvf-4YmihqYZ31AD1LCDw9e8", "title": "Is Zombie Club Dead ？", "body": "Zombie Club跌破發行價了，Is Zombie Club Dead ? \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JS5yidHbIirysqaMWBK4W.png?height=1142&width=1848)\n\n我的回答是，Not yet。我去看了看lok666的IG，還有416萬粉絲；去看了看Zombie Club的twitter，還有58.6K的follower。回憶了一下當初加入ZC的一些基本邏輯：\n\n1，lok666 shawn是明星裡最會玩NFT的，在潮流趨勢和品牌方面有比較大的影響力，有粉絲的基本盤，有流量； \n 2，相比較其他明星的流量收割，ZC定位在智庫和教育方面，獨樹一幟，讓人相信有一些新的期待； \n 3，Founder裡有disco.eth，一個在BAYC和其他社區都很有影響力的大玩家，無論是思想上還是認知上，都是一流的； \n 4，相比較一般的NFT項目，ZC在產業鏈條的佈局上，也頗有計畫和準備，無論是和HTC的合作，還是佈局技術公司上，都屬於較為預見性的規劃。\n\n回過頭去看，這些基本邏輯都還在，有些邏輯還在最新的一些項目的推進中得到驗證。應該說從項目一開始就加入ZC Discord並成為MOD的人員來說，對社區還是非常有感情的。拋開感情因素，想客觀的聊一聊ZC怎麼了，儘量的讓一些描述可以準確一些。雖然我也有簽NDA，不過我想我還是相對安全的，因為我努力的做到不知道，這叫做🙉。所以本文是基本基於我的一些觀察和小結，不代表任何項目觀點。\n\n1，ZC社群的構成。我在ZC社群裡認識了很多朋友，素質非常的高，尤其我喜歡去逛自我介紹的欄目，每篇每篇的去看，那裡有一個個ID背後鮮活的靈魂。NFT社區大概的構成主要有肝者，dirty flipper，小白新手，KOL，Fuder，科學家，少量的死忠信仰者、以及運營團隊 mod等，還有大量的超乎想像的bots。這些身分有時候是互相交錯的，就像一個人可以有不同的性格和身分一樣，他們也是動態轉化的。比如藍籌holder們也可以很肝，KOL也可以是dirty flipper，Fuder們只是想拿到低價籌碼，諸如此類，這就是這個社區自由帶來的多元化。ZC社群的構成，起點很高，在項目白名單分配階段，有很多非常高質量的文章，這也讓整個社區充滿了活力和期待。\n\n2，毫無疑問，“肝白”工作室，“打金”工作室對項目的傷害遠遠大於貢獻。因此在ZC早期的社區裡，按照fair launch的理念，mod團隊做了很多anti-bot的工作，這其中包括一人多號，以及手工“肝”的高級bot行為。相比較那些一眼就可以看出來的工作室機器人，手工“肝”是一個比較高級的，又有智商又勤奮工作的行為，他們能夠準確把握團隊選擇偏好，雖然在最後的階段也被偵測出來，但主要考量到1，他們成功獲得了mod的認可，拿到了白名單；2，尊重勞動和尊重規則 ，那些ID的白名單最終得以保留。最多的一個互相關聯的ID，大概拿到了10多個WL，嘆為觀止。NFT項目/社區裡只能觀察到持有地址數，至於有到底有多少個真人holder，這個數量只能估計。ZC項目在anti bot方面，已經盡到了最大的努力，極大的做到了fair launch。我當初的保守的初略估計，45k的社區依然有50%-70%是bots或者重複用戶馬甲小號等等；儘管如此，ZC社區在同向的項目裡，依然是做的很不錯的。但值得注意的是，可能受到了shawn的個人魅力的影響，ZC社區裡新手或者接觸NFT不久的用戶，也佔到了相當大的一部分，我猜想這可能和傳統媒體的幾次宣傳有關係。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0w_VyaEn9gLahmV7wQM5.png?height=412&width=1011)\n\n3，應該說pre launch階段，有一個明確的目標，社區成員之間充滿了緊張又活潑的競爭合作關係，社區的活力非常足，也基本上不存在FUD的情緒。正所謂攻城容易守城難，launch以後的ZC社區面臨了轉型和發展的問題。基本表現為，社區逐漸出現很多FUD和不滿意的聲音，有一些holder高買低賣割肉離場，有一些由愛及恨，FP和成交量量價齊跌，以至於連空投和自己claim都要拿出來fud一下是否大氣。其實社區裡有很多聰明的大腦已經注意到了這些現象，在整理他們的觀察基礎上，我試圖從不同的角度，來分析一下社區目前存在的問題和改進措施：\n\n3\\.1 Launch以前和launch以後社區型態的轉型問題，項目方和社區從買賣關係轉型到合作關係過程：在lauch以前，項目方和社區成員是買賣關係，在賺錢效應的激勵下，不停的有玩家進來社區來試圖獲得白名單，項目方則選擇理想的成員授予白名單，這一切在NFT發行以後，買賣交易完成後，即告一段落了。發行以後，按照web3的敘事，社區holder成了項目的持份者，從買賣關係變成了合作關係。而當下的ZC社區，正處在這樣的轉型期間，似乎項目方與社區成員之間，都需要重新定位找到自己相對舒適的位置。然而雙方思維的慣性，可能是當下社區存在的最大問題。ZC社區在pre launch以前有很清晰的fair launch和donate your brain的概念，在launch以後則變得模糊了，戰略的定位和措施不夠清晰，項目方面又專注於新領域和metaverse的開發，這是目前最大的尷尬階段。一個和尚挑水喝，兩個和尚抬水喝，三個和尚沒水喝。現在的ZC社區大腦們都還在，卻扎扎實實遇到了三個和尚沒水喝的困境。社區的激勵機制的缺乏導致成員參與程度的不夠，項目方扎實推進的項目不受社區認可，社區缺乏新生的力量，這是社區轉型過程中常見的通病，這也在ZC裡也都有了影子；現在的ZC社區就像是一座大金礦，而很多礦工只是站在地面互相指責，沒有人真正的在哪裡挖掘社區的能量和潛力。如何改進？需要所有的holder回到初心上，捫心自問，如果我是zc holder，我為什麼要加入這個社區，我理想的社區是什麼樣的，我希望項目方能夠提供什麼樣的資源和幫助，沒有項目方，我們社區的holder之間可以做些什麼？沒有人可以阻止你想這些問題，而這些建設性的想法，才可能讓ZC重新出發。知道自己需要什麼特別重要，這一點也同樣適用於ZC的core team，需要社區怎麼支持，如何共同建設藍籌初心；\n\n3\\.2 成也founders ，founders就像是蕭何，也在我的購買NFT的核心邏輯裡。我們看到Lok666的明星邊際效應是遞減的，這在DC裡面的666欄目裡的reaction就可以看到。毫無疑問，lok666是zc項目 core中core ，4個founders理解為1+3的配置也是理所當然的。我們從上文知道了，ZC club是一個多元的社區，不像其他明星社區以粉絲為主，這可能也是社區目前存在的一些問題。ZC holders多元的背景，和目前觀察到的lok666的邊際效應相互印證。什麼意思呢？就是ZC holder裡不完全是lok666叔的無腦粉絲，他們有著各種各樣不同的訴求和期望，這種多元化即是優勢，也是目前社區狀態的必然。ZC的team客觀上也無法完全聽到或者滿足這些多元的、有些甚至還是怪異的訴求；lok666依然是zc的靈魂，如何駕馭這個多元社區，對於6叔是個挑戰，對於社區本身，也是一個挑戰，如何重新找到一個舒適的位置？或許經過一些自然選擇的過程，不久的將來ZC們一起聊聊天，喝喝酒，玩玩手錶，看看車，不也是挺舒服的嗎？\n\n3\\.3 一些過往的傷疤。🐟的記憶有三秒，不知道web3的記憶能有多久。OOG 算是一個ZC過往比較大的一個疤痕。這件事情已經有了定論，但每次FUD總少不了。相信其實都從整個事件的發展中學習到了經驗，總結吸取了教訓。如何讓過往的傷疤翻篇，儘管這件事情對holder本身可能沒有太大傷害，但如果阻礙了新鮮力量的加入，那的確還是需要重新思考和評估的。\n\n3\\.4 ZC可能會成為一個DAO組織嗎？我不知道。個人對於DAO非常的有興趣。DAO或許是可以成為ZC的一個出路和解決方案，當然前提是ZC社區重新找回到自己的位置。讓項目方專注於帶領社區進入metaverse，讓社區成為自治組織繼續自由生長，讓ZC成為一塊社區成員自由生長的肥沃土壤，讓資源在社區裡自由公平的流動，讓社區充滿開放包容的自由空氣【包括FUD】，或許是這我所期待的ZC社區。\n\n愛一個人不需要理由，罵一個人也不需要任何藉口。獻給ZC club。", "timestamp": 1654663437, "digest": "f6XsBuRHpxXwTDbHGrb4Gjq9Qr41WyHXRm8hyCWKDqA", "contributor": "0xaC2c874f01914C89601abDDc6320ee36bB396D47"}

{"id": "FuI6r9sMtqVuffYiRVV66tCw90z_ZI6qa3Toxge0Xcc", "title": "Is Zombie Club Dead ？", "body": "Zombie Club跌破發行價了，Is Zombie Club Dead ? \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JS5yidHbIirysqaMWBK4W.png?height=1142&width=1848)\n\n我的回答是，Not yet。我去看了看lok666的IG，還有416萬粉絲；去看了看Zombie Club的twitter，還有58.6K的follower。回憶了一下當初加入ZC的一些基本邏輯：\n\n1，lok666 shawn是明星裡最會玩NFT的，在潮流趨勢和品牌方面有比較大的影響力，有粉絲的基本盤，有流量； \n 2，相比較其他明星的流量收割，ZC定位在智庫和教育方面，獨樹一幟，讓人相信有一些新的期待； \n 3，Founder裡有disco.eth，一個在BAYC和其他社區都很有影響力的大玩家，無論是思想上還是認知上，都是一流的； \n 4，相比較一般的NFT項目，ZC在產業鏈條的佈局上，也頗有計畫和準備，無論是和HTC的合作，還是佈局技術公司上，都屬於較為預見性的規劃。\n\n回過頭去看，這些基本邏輯都還在，有些邏輯還在最新的一些項目的推進中得到驗證。應該說從項目一開始就加入ZC Discord並成為MOD的人員來說，對社區還是非常有感情的。拋開感情因素，想客觀的聊一聊ZC怎麼了，儘量的讓一些描述可以準確一些。雖然我也有簽NDA，不過我想我還是相對安全的，因為我努力的做到不知道，這叫做🙉。所以本文是基本基於我的一些觀察和小結，不代表任何項目觀點。\n\n1，ZC社群的構成。我在ZC社群裡認識了很多朋友，素質非常的高，尤其我喜歡去逛自我介紹的欄目，每篇每篇的去看，那裡有一個個ID背後鮮活的靈魂。NFT社區大概的構成主要有肝者，dirty flipper，小白新手，KOL，Fuder，科學家，少量的死忠信仰者、以及運營團隊 mod等，還有大量的超乎想像的bots。這些身分有時候是互相交錯的，就像一個人可以有不同的性格和身分一樣，他們也是動態轉化的。比如藍籌holder們也可以很肝，KOL也可以是dirty flipper，Fuder們只是想拿到低價籌碼，諸如此類，這就是這個社區自由帶來的多元化。ZC社群的構成，起點很高，在項目白名單分配階段，有很多非常高質量的文章，這也讓整個社區充滿了活力和期待。\n\n2，毫無疑問，“肝白”工作室，“打金”工作室對項目的傷害遠遠大於貢獻。因此在ZC早期的社區裡，按照fair launch的理念，mod團隊做了很多anti-bot的工作，這其中包括一人多號，以及手工“肝”的高級bot行為。相比較那些一眼就可以看出來的工作室機器人，手工“肝”是一個比較高級的，又有智商又勤奮工作的行為，他們能夠準確把握團隊選擇偏好，雖然在最後的階段也被偵測出來，但主要考量到1，他們成功獲得了mod的認可，拿到了白名單；2，尊重勞動和尊重規則 ，那些ID的白名單最終得以保留。最多的一個互相關聯的ID，大概拿到了10多個WL，嘆為觀止。NFT項目/社區裡只能觀察到持有地址數，至於有到底有多少個真人holder，這個數量只能估計。ZC項目在anti bot方面，已經盡到了最大的努力，極大的做到了fair launch。我當初的保守的初略估計，45k的社區依然有50%-70%是bots或者重複用戶馬甲小號等等；儘管如此，ZC社區在同向的項目裡，依然是做的很不錯的。但值得注意的是，可能受到了shawn的個人魅力的影響，ZC社區裡新手或者接觸NFT不久的用戶，也佔到了相當大的一部分，我猜想這可能和傳統媒體的幾次宣傳有關係。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0w_VyaEn9gLahmV7wQM5.png?height=412&width=1011)\n\n3，應該說pre launch階段，有一個明確的目標，社區成員之間充滿了緊張又活潑的競爭合作關係，社區的活力非常足，也基本上不存在FUD的情緒。正所謂攻城容易守城難，launch以後的ZC社區面臨了轉型和發展的問題。基本表現為，社區逐漸出現很多FUD和不滿意的聲音，有一些holder高買低賣割肉離場，有一些由愛及恨，FP和成交量量價齊跌，以至於連空投和自己claim都要拿出來fud一下是否大氣。其實社區裡有很多聰明的大腦已經注意到了這些現象，在整理他們的觀察基礎上，我試圖從不同的角度，來分析一下社區目前存在的問題和改進措施：\n\n3\\.1 Launch以前和launch以後社區型態的轉型問題，項目方和社區從買賣關係轉型到合作關係過程：在lauch以前，項目方和社區成員是買賣關係，在賺錢效應的激勵下，不停的有玩家進來社區來試圖獲得白名單，項目方則選擇理想的成員授予白名單，這一切在NFT發行以後，買賣交易完成後，即告一段落了。發行以後，按照web3的敘事，社區holder成了項目的持份者，從買賣關係變成了合作關係。而當下的ZC社區，正處在這樣的轉型期間，似乎項目方與社區成員之間，都需要重新定位找到自己相對舒適的位置。然而雙方思維的慣性，可能是當下社區存在的最大問題。ZC社區在pre launch以前有很清晰的fair launch和donate your brain的概念，在launch以後則變得模糊了，戰略的定位和措施不夠清晰，項目方面又專注於新領域和metaverse的開發，這是目前最大的尷尬階段。一個和尚挑水喝，兩個和尚抬水喝，三個和尚沒水喝。現在的ZC社區大腦們都還在，卻扎扎實實遇到了三個和尚沒水喝的困境。社區的激勵機制的缺乏導致成員參與程度的不夠，項目方扎實推進的項目不受社區認可，社區缺乏新生的力量，這是社區轉型過程中常見的通病，這也在ZC裡也都有了影子；現在的ZC社區就像是一座大金礦，而很多礦工只是站在地面互相指責，沒有人真正的在哪裡挖掘社區的能量和潛力。如何改進？需要所有的holder回到初心上，捫心自問，如果我是zc holder，我為什麼要加入這個社區，我理想的社區是什麼樣的，我希望項目方能夠提供什麼樣的資源和幫助，沒有項目方，我們社區的holder之間可以做些什麼？沒有人可以阻止你想這些問題，而這些建設性的想法，才可能讓ZC重新出發。知道自己需要什麼特別重要，這一點也同樣適用於ZC的core team，需要社區怎麼支持，如何共同建設藍籌初心；\n\n3\\.2 成也founders ，founders就像是蕭何，也在我的購買NFT的核心邏輯裡。我們看到Lok666的明星邊際效應是遞減的，這在DC裡面的666欄目裡的reaction就可以看到。毫無疑問，lok666是zc項目 core中core ，4個founders理解為1+3的配置也是理所當然的。我們從上文知道了，ZC club是一個多元的社區，不像其他明星社區以粉絲為主，這可能也是社區目前存在的一些問題。ZC holders多元的背景，和目前觀察到的lok666的邊際效應相互印證。什麼意思呢？就是ZC holder裡不完全是lok666叔的無腦粉絲，他們有著各種各樣不同的訴求和期望，這種多元化即是優勢，也是目前社區狀態的必然。ZC的team客觀上也無法完全聽到或者滿足這些多元的、有些甚至還是怪異的訴求；lok666依然是zc的靈魂，如何駕馭這個多元社區，對於6叔是個挑戰，對於社區本身，也是一個挑戰，如何重新找到一個舒適的位置？或許經過一些自然選擇的過程，不久的將來ZC們一起聊聊天，喝喝酒，玩玩手錶，看看車，不也是挺舒服的嗎？\n\n3\\.3 一些過往的傷疤。🐟的記憶有三秒，不知道web3的記憶能有多久。OOG 算是一個ZC過往比較大的一個疤痕。這件事情已經有了定論，但每次FUD總少不了。相信其實都從整個事件的發展中學習到了經驗，總結吸取了教訓。如何讓過往的傷疤翻篇，儘管這件事情對holder本身可能沒有太大傷害，但如果阻礙了新鮮力量的加入，那的確還是需要重新思考和評估的。\n\n3\\.4 ZC可能會成為一個DAO組織嗎？我不知道。個人對於DAO非常的有興趣。DAO或許是可以成為ZC的一個出路和解決方案，當然前提是ZC社區重新找回到自己的位置。讓項目方專注於帶領社區進入metaverse，讓社區成為自治組織繼續自由生長，讓ZC社區成長成為一塊成員生長的肥沃土壤，保持開放包容的自由空氣，或許是我所期待的ZC社區。\n\n愛一個人不需要理由，罵一個人也不需要任何藉口。獻給ZC club。", "timestamp": 1654663332, "digest": "f6XsBuRHpxXwTDbHGrb4Gjq9Qr41WyHXRm8hyCWKDqA", "contributor": "0xaC2c874f01914C89601abDDc6320ee36bB396D47"}

NFT**：由Ward进行操作，但在NFT无Guardian条件下才可以进行转移操作。NFT在发生转移行为前，智能合约会验证NFT是否具有Guardian地址，如果有，则拒绝发起转移；如果无，则可以进行转移。\n\n**设置Guardian**：由Ward设置。请注意，Ward只可以在Guardian地址为空时，设置Guardian地址和个数。在NFT已有Guardian情况下，Ward不可以对Guardian的地址和数量进行更改。只有当NFT不具有任何Guardian时，Ward才可以进行设置。当具有Guardian时，Ward不能够对NFT进行转移操作。\n\n**取消Guardian**：由Guardian完成操作。当Ward地址想要转移NFT时，需要所有Guardian都取消自己的Guardian身份。\n\n**销毁在ward地址中的原来的NFT并重新铸造新的NFT(新旧两个NFT具有相同的Token ID)**：由Guardian完成操作。当Ward设置好Guardian后，如果很不幸，Ward地址私钥发生泄露或丢失，由于此时原来的NFT无法被Ward转移，不会出现因NFT转移对任何人造成损失的可能。此时，Guardian调用智能合约，智能合约将原来的NFT从原地址进行销毁，并铸造新的NFT，同时指定新的NFT的接收地址，新的NFT将转移到指定的地址。新旧两个NFT的Token ID相同，新的NFT的元数据指向原有的NFT的元数据。因此，新的NFT具有与原NFT相同的属性。当新的NFT生成后，原有NFT的Guardian可能失去了价值，新NFT的Ward可以重新设置Guardian（亦可在新NFT生成时，保留原Guardian设置）。\n\n**某NFT设置Guardian地址后，几种场景下的使用。**\n\nWard对不安全智能合约进行了授权或者被黑客盗取了私钥：由于此时NFT具有Guardian，当黑客在Ward的地址发起转移NFT要求时，该举动会被智能合约拒绝，黑客无法盗取该NFT。当NFT所有者意识到自己的授权存在危险或者自己的私钥泄露后，可以有时间取消对不安全智能合约的授权或直接通过Guardian地址销毁原有NFT，并生成新的具有相同的Token ID的NFT。\n\n转移NFT：Guardian需解除自身Guardian身份，当NFT的Guardian的地址和数量为空时，Ward可以进行NFT转移。\n\n**补充**\n\n**ENS已经使用类似方法,设计了到期的ENS的重新注册机制。我们也从中找到了灵感，改进了ERC721QS-1P。下面是一个实例。**\n\n**<https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf5a4f4039c7e5690f220d2752fe83efd5ca37e61137b5334ea968e0c859a8483>**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mN-Y386ff8QIMq-pF36nm.png?height=349&width=865)\n\n**NFT防盗及NFT租赁协议：ERC721QS-2**\n\n**角色或者地址设置**\n\nWard :被监护人地址。NFT持有者，一般为NFT所在的钱包地址。当Guardian地址和数量为空时，Ward可以进行NFT的转移操作，也可以设置Guardian地址和数量。但NFT已存在Guardian地址时，不经Guardian允许，Ward无法修改Guardian地址和数量，且无法对NFT进行转移操作。\n\nGuardian: 监护人地址。NFT的监护人，一般为NFT持有者的冷钱包地址，或者是NFT持有者信任的地址。Guardian可以自行解除自己的Guardian身份，或者在NFT所在的Ward地址出现异常后，调用NFT智能合约，将 NFT转移到指定的地址。\n\n两个角色可能涉及的操作\n\n**Mint NFT**：由Ward进行操作。\n\n**转移 NFT：**\n\n1，由Ward进行操作，但在NFT无Guardian条件下才可以进行转移操作。NFT在发生转移行为前，智能合约会验证NFT是否具有Guardian，如果有，则拒绝发起转移；如果无，则可以进行转移。\n\n2，由Guardian操作。当NFT有Guardian条件下，经所有Guardian同意，将 NFT转移到指定的地址。\n\n**设置Guardian**：由Ward设置。请注意，Ward只可以**在**Guardian地址为空时，设置**Guardian**地址和个数。在NFT已有Guardian情况下，Ward不可以对Guardian的地址和数量进行更改。只有当NFT不具有任何Guardian时，Ward才可以进行设置。当具有Guardian时，Ward不能够对NFT进行转移操作。\n\n**移除Guardian**：由Guardian完成操作。当Ward想要转移NFT时，需要所有Guardian都移除自己的Guardian身份。\n\n**Ward地址不可用，需要转移NFT**：由Guardian进行操作。当Ward设置好Guardian后，如果很不幸，Ward地址私钥发生泄露或丢失，由于此时NFT无法被Ward转移，不会出现因NFT转移对任何人造成损失的可能。此时，Guardian调用智能合约将NFT转移到新的地址。\n\n**某NFT设置Guardian地址后，几种场景下的使用。**\n\nWard对不安全智能合约进行了授权或者被黑客盗取了私钥：由于此时NFT具有Guardian，当黑客在Ward地址发起转移NFT要求时，该举动会被智能合约拒绝，黑客无法盗取该NFT。当用户意识到自己的授权存在危险或者自己的私钥泄露后，可以有时间取消对不安全智能合约的授权或直接通过Guardian将 NFT转移到指定的安全地址。\n\n转移NFT（特别是需要转移给他人的情况，如通过OpenSea卖出）：Guardian地址需解除自身Guardian身份，当NFT的Guardian的地址和数量为空时，Ward可以进行NFT转移。\n\n一个比喻：当NFT需要转移给其他人或者被卖出时，我们理解为NFT这个孩子长大了，它需要组建新的家庭了，所以当前监护人就应该放手了。\n\n**进一步改进：**\n\nWard在设置Guardian时，可以对Guardian设置有效期（expires），到期后Guardian的设置可自动解除，Ward可以进行NFT转移。避免因Guardian私钥丢失等问题导致NFT损失。\n\n部分Guardian同意亦可转移NFT，如设置了4个Guardian，只需3个Guardian同意即可转移NFT。\n\n**NFT租赁和NFT抵押借贷**\n\n这种机制为NFT租赁市场的开启打通了渠道。将持有权与转移权进行分离，则实际拥有者可以设置若干个Guardian地址来控制转移权，当存在租赁需求时，实际拥有者可以将NFT转移至租赁者地址（更进一步的，Guardian可以设置转移时间间隔，比如3个月，此时，三个月内，Guardian不能够调用智能合约转移NFT，以保障租赁者的权益）。同时，为了和以后潜在的NFT租赁平台用例相结合，Guardian角色既可以授予个人，也可以授予智能合约，或两者综合形式。\n\n同时，它还提出了一种新的NFT抵押借贷模型。\n\n**说明**\n\nGuardian的地址设置非常灵活，这使得它能使得协议导向不同的应用方向和场景，同时也能兼容未来的NFT的一些应用场景。我们有一篇不那么严肃的《Guardian地址的一百种玩法》，将不断完善，仅供参考。例如，我们想了一种很有意思的场景：如果你想成为某个NFT的钻石手，你也可以对Guardian设置期限，并将Guardian设置为一些特殊地址，那么，在期限之内，你就不会因市场波动导致的心理压力而卖出自己的NFT。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/5660.eth/0TKe6Ere091ZuGWN1QEzyB6FFyjun42c0BYVSLrsHWQ](https://mirror.xyz/5660.eth/0TKe6Ere091ZuGWN1QEzyB6FFyjun42c0BYVSLrsHWQ)\n\n在不具有Guardian情况下，遵循ERC721QS协议的NFT的操作与目前普通的NFT操作没有任何不同。\n\n设置Guardian确实增加了用户资金成本和操作步骤。但这需要持有者自行权衡考虑，比如对于高价值的NFT，持有者如果倾向于长期持有（多签也是一种保存NFT的方式，但它的可操作性更差，对用户更加不友好，且满足不了NFT的某些使用场景，比如NFT租赁、NFT抵押借贷等），那么用户就可以设置Guardian。对于低价值的NFT，也许用户不愿意设置Guardian。但是，我们不能单从价格来判断NFT对一个持有者的价值，也许某个没有市场价值的NFT，对持有者也非常重要，比如他一生中重要时刻的照片或录像做成的NFT，持有者也可以对此NFT设置Guardian。同时，由于NFT大部分时间都处于静止状态，发生转移的频率并不高，因此在需要转移NFT时解除Guardian身份设置即可，相较于资产安全性的大幅提升，操作便利性的降低影响不大。\n\n可能出现的一种新型诈骗手段：即不道德的Guardian与购买者达成线下交易，将NFT转入购买者的地址，收款之后将NFT再次转出，从而达到了诈骗目的。\n\n对此的解决方案：在协议层或NFT智能合约中，可以考虑对有Guardian设置的和无Guardian设置的NFT在显示上作以明显区分和提示；对于行业参与者，比如NFT查看平台或者NFT交易平台，可以将上述两者分为不同的类别进行显示和进行操作。此外，目前NFT交易的主要途径仍然是通过NFT交易平台，在NFT交易平台完成的交易，不会出现此类被诈骗的情况。我们认为线下交易本身对双方信任程度要求就比较高，诈骗者想通过这种方式获得不法收入的难度较高。但出于对用户利益的考虑，我们需要将预防诈骗纳入到我们的考虑当中。\n\n该协议通常建议写进NFT自身智能合约中，也建议已发行的NFT考虑升级智能合约。\n\n**其他几种方案（但认为目前不够好）**\n\n抵押申诉方案：一旦持有者的NFT被盗，他可以向某组织（比如项目方设置的DAO组织）提起被盗申诉，但这需要抵押一定资金。如果该组织认定原持有者申诉成功，则该持有者取回自己的NFT或获得新的具有相同属性的NFT，且退还押金（某组织可以从申诉者那里收取一定的服务费用，用来激励那些参与对申诉的评判的人们）,如果该组织认定申诉失败，则该持有者的押金将会被全部没收。\n\n区块链警察DAO或审判官DAO：如果未来Web3形成了此类比较具有公信力的组织，则可以将NFT智能合约接入该组织的预言机，由该组织判定是否存在被盗情况且对被盗资产进行一定程度的限制和处理。\n\nChallenger Research观点\n\n区块链是去中心化的，但不是去正义化的。维护人们的安全需要，是促进更多人加入区块链、使用区块链的关键。\n\nWeb2是通过行政和法律手段治理黑客，但目前往往收效不佳。Web3实际上缺乏有效方式治理黑客，但我们可以将黑客获益降低。实际上黑客们组成非常强大的安全团队和开发组织，我们通过赏金计划或者让他们满意的灵活的招聘方式，也能够吸引他们做出对区块链行业有益的事，而不是只做出伤害行业利益的事。\n\n本协议发布后，迎来了很多技术方面的讨论。希望大家不仅站在技术的角度考虑问题，也需要切换一下身份，从不同区块链行业参与者角度，思考这套协议的必要性。\n\n**SBT设计机制：ERC721QS-3**\n\nQS-3建立在QS-2的改进上，实际上，由于Guardian地址的设置非常灵活，实现所谓的SBT（我们实际更愿意称之为身份证明NFT，但似乎SBT应用更广，在QS-3中不再进行具体区分），只需要对QS-2的机制做一些调整即可。调整如下\n\n1，SBT发行时就可以带有Guardian角色，同一系列的SBT可以具有相同的Guardian。此时Ward可以mint SBT，但mint SBT后无转移权。或者Ward不需要mint SBT，直接由Guardian分发SBT。\n\n2，Guardian可以合谋重设新的Guardian（引入新成员，比如公司管理层扩张），或者取消某Guardian身份（剔除某成员，比如某成员去世或者不尽职）。\n\n3，不同Guardian的履职期限可以不同，且不必立即开始，某Guardian可以在未来才起作用（比如，议会选举出的新议员身份已经确定，但尚未进入履职周期）。\n\n4，可选的。关闭Ward的转移权限。即，即使所有Guardian都自行取消了身份（比如公司破产解散），Ward也无法转移该NFT或者SBT。\n\n举个应用例子。比如哈佛大学学士学位SBT。当一个哈佛学生顺利通过答辩并毕业后，**学校的Guardian就向他的地址转移具有唯一编码的学位SBT**，这样就证明他从该学校毕业并获得学士学位了。他能够通过验证自己钱包的所有权，证明自己获得了哈佛大学学士学位，进而可以用于求职、社交等场景。如果他的地址私钥泄露或丢失了，他可以向学校提起申请，**学校Guardian可以将他的学位SBT转移到他的新地址**。如果该学生后续被查出学术不端或者存在违背哈佛大学宗旨的行为，**学校Guardian也可以收回他的学位SBT**。对于该SBT，学生只有使用权，而没有转移权或者交易权，因为该学位SBT的价值来源于哈佛大学的背书，所以哈佛大学对它的分发和转移有着重要权利。\n\n**角色或者地址设置**\n\nWard :被监护人。SBT（比如某大学学位证书、某公司CEO身份证明、某国总统身份证明或者某银行信贷承诺额度证明）持有者，一般为SBT所在的钱包地址。当SBT已存在Guardian地址时，不经Guardian允许，Ward无法修改Guardian地址和数量，且无法对SBT进行转移操作。当Guardian地址和数量为空时，Ward可以进行SBT的转移操作，也可以设置Guardian地址和数量。\n\nGuardian: 监护人。SBT的监护人，一般为相应社会组织或个人的若干地址（比如某大学、某公司董事会、比如某国家的议会、某银行、某DAO组织），或者是SBT持有者信任的地址（比如信贷担保人）。Guardian可以自行解除自己的Guardian身份（比如，辞职），经规定数量的Guardian同意，SBT可以增加或者移除Guardian。在SBT所在的Ward地址出现异常后，Guardian可调用SBT智能合约，将 SBT转移到指定的地址。\n\n**两个角色可能涉及的操作**\n\n**Mint SBT**：由Ward进行操作。或者Ward无需mint。智能合约生成SBT后，SBT直接由Guardian支配并分发。\n\n**转移 SBT：**\n\n1，由Guardian操作。当SBT有Guardian条件下，经所有或部分Guardian同意，将SBT转移到指定的地址。\n\n2，由Ward进行操作，但在SBT无Guardian条件下才可以进行转移操作。Ward在发起转移行为前，智能合约会验证SBT是否具有Guardian地址，如果有，则拒绝发起转移；如果无，则可以进行转移（可选的，此权限可以关闭）。\n\n**设置Guardian**：\n\nSBT初始发行时，由智能合约设定Guardian。或者在SBT转移至Ward地址后，由Ward设置。\n\n**增加或移除Guardian：**\n\n经规定数量的Guardian同意，SBT可以增加Guardian，或者移除Guardian。\n\n此外，不同Guardian可以具有不同履职时间区间，也不必在当前时间节点就进行履职，某一Guardian可能在未来才进行履职。\n\n**移除Guardian**：由Guardian自行完成操作。\n\n**Ward地址不可用，需要转移SBT至新的地址**：由Guardian进行操作。如果很不幸，Ward地址私钥发生泄露或丢失，由于此时SBT无法被Ward转移，不会出现因SBT转移对任何人造成损失的可能（但需要谨慎，可能存在SBT被冒用的可能）。此时，Guardian调用智能合约将SBT转移到新的地址。\n\n**对SBT进行升级**\n\n如果Guardian需要对原有的SBT智能合约进行升级，发行新的SBT（例如，更换身份证或使得大学毕业证书更加美观）。Guardian无需通知和要求Ward进行一些复杂操作。Guardian只需对原有SBT持有的地址进行快照，然后再向他们发放新的SBT即可。对于原来的SBT，如果Guardian认为有必要，也可以从Ward地址中收回。或者不进行收回，作为Ward的纪念品。\n\nChallenger Research观点\n\nGuardian越多，成员组成成分越复杂，操作难度越大，成本越高。设计上确实如此，但这不值得诟病，因为符合社会学理论。对于越高价值的SBT（比如，“总统身份SBT”），Guardian将该SBT转移给特定地址这一行为，应该是愈发谨慎的，gas支出也是必要的治理成本，以免SBT被滥用和滥发。如果仅仅是比较低价值的SBT，比如你的一场非正式聚会的邀请函的发放，你可以只设置一个Guardian。如果目标集中在降低操作成本，我们也可以将其建立在layer2上，甚至可以建立layer3上（此概念最早由StarkNet提出。不同于layer2，layer3更加灵活，可仅用于比较广泛或者比较重要的特定用途和满足特殊需求，比如SBT以后可能的隐私需求）。或者，也可以考虑新的公链。但目前我们认为使用Layer2、Layer3或者建立新的公链的需求，可以研究，但并不急迫。原因有两点：一是市场对SBT的需求尚未充分扩展，对SBT的功能需求也需要进一步研究；二是随着ETH2.0的实现，ETH主网的性能也有所提升。\n\nQS-3对Guardian赋予了更大权限，这对Guardian组织本身的治理提出了更高要求，这个组织可以是议会、公司，也可以最新兴起的DAO。对于Guardian的治理，是个值得深入研究的问题。也有很多Web3的治理方式被提出，比如我们利用博弈论理论提出的“三角形架构”和“相互确保摧毁机制”。行业可以在这方面展开更深层次的讨论和研究。\n\n通过进一步设计，在某种机制下，只有使用权的SBT自身所在的地址，也可以成为另一种SBT的Guardian。比如，某国家的公民身份认证机关Guardian对公民授出了“公民身份SBT”，但在总统直接选举上，持有公民身份SBT的地址就可以成为选民Guardian。选民可以将自己的选票投给某一个总统候选人（调用智能合约，要求将“总统身份SBT”或“候任总统SBT”转移给某个候选人的地址），当某个候选人的地址获得足够的选民Guardian支持后，“总统身份SBT”将自动转移到他的地址。而该候选人持有“总统身份SBT”后，将凭借“总统身份SBT”解锁一系列相关权限，比如军队指挥权、核武器使用授权（如果SBT将来可能具有这种权限，你就应该理解，将某些SBT转移至指定地址的操作，即使是再复杂再谨慎，也是不过分的）等。\n\n对于SBT的制作和发行，我们应该设计出更简单更便利的方式。比如设计一个网站，当一个晚会发起者想要做一个SBT作为自己的晚会邀请函时，他只需要登录网站，连接自己的钱包地址，输入Guardian地址，输入要生成SBT的的名称、内容和数量等，他就可以生成自己想要的SBT了。如果他想将SBT转移给某个晚会参与者，他也可以在这个网站进行操作；或者他想认识一些新朋友，就取消自己的Guardian身份，让SBT可以自由转移。技术的先进性和技术的普及性不具有必然联系，两者之间的纽带是可用性和便利性。\n\n**增强隐私保护和安全 QS-X**\n\n在QS-1、QS-2和QS-3中，Guardian的身份是公开的，且他们的操作行为是公开的，这可能不利于保护Guardian的隐私和安全。比如在社会舆论和强权压力下，Guardian可能做出不符合自己意愿的选择。如果Guardian有隐私保护和安全方面的需求，进一步的我们可以采用MPC或零知识证明之类的技术完善它。这可以用于无记名投票，匿名亿万富翁俱乐部慈善基金的使用等场景。\n\n**补充**\n\n需要注意的是， 在ERC721QS中，由于增加了NFT租赁、NFT抵押借贷和SBT等使用场景的支持，NFT的持有者不一定就是NFT的所有权的拥有者，持有者可以是承租人、贷款人和使用者等。\n\n我们注意到有些EIPS(以太坊改进提案)致力于解决NFT租赁问题，但研究后认为它们并不符合现实社会中的惯例。比如一种做法是，利用NFT租赁智能合约，owner将NFT质押进入租赁智能合约地址，然后给租赁者赋予user这一身份。从技术上看当然是行的通的，但不符合现实中的租赁和使用关系。举个例子，这相当于是租客和房东签了一个租赁合同（通过智能合约），我们可以通过房产证证明房东身份（owner），也可以通过租赁合同证明租客身份(user)。但是，我们却没有把房子的钥匙交给租客，租客证明自己有对房子使用权的方式，是拿着租赁合同告诉大家，我签了一份租赁合同，并付了款。而房子呢，既不在房东那里，也不在租客手里，却在中介（NFT租赁智能合约地址）手里。这听起来十分奇怪。\n\n有人提出了一种简单的SBT设计方式，即利用现有的ERC721协议，生成SBT，但将owner对SBT的转移权关闭（却没有QS-3中提到的，Guardian可以转移SBT的设计）。这种方式也不满足现实中的某些应用场景，比如前文提到的哈佛大学学士学位SBT，如果一名哈佛大学学生被查出了学术不端行为，理论上是应该收回他的学士学位的，但上面的方式是做不到的，因此这名学术不端的哈佛毕业生，仍然可以拿着哈佛大学学士学位SBT继续招摇撞骗,这对哈佛大学的声誉会造成不良影响。\n\n研究支持：By

{"id": "KrbntE7mQSLBlRySQ6EmgSpiXsQfpIAsdIbg1C8ip5k", "title": "Is Zombie Club Dead ？", "body": "Zombie Club跌破發行價了，Is Zombie Club Dead ? \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JS5yidHbIirysqaMWBK4W.png?height=1142&width=1848)\n\n我的回答是，Not yet。我去看了看lok666的IG，還有416萬粉絲；去看了看Zombie Club的twitter，還有58.6K的follower。回憶了一下當初加入ZC的一些基本邏輯：\n\n1，lok666 shawn是明星裡最會玩NFT的，在潮流趨勢和品牌方面有比較大的影響力，有粉絲的基本盤，有流量； \n 2，相比較其他明星的流量收割，ZC定位在智庫和教育方面，獨樹一幟，讓人相信有一些新的期待； \n 3，Founder裡有disco.eth，一個在BAYC和其他社區都很有影響力的大玩家，無論是思想上還是認知上，都是一流的； \n 4，相比較一般的NFT項目，ZC在產業鏈條的佈局上，也頗有計畫和準備，無論是和HTC的合作，還是佈局技術公司上，都屬於較為預見性的規劃。\n\n回過頭去看，這些基本邏輯都還在，有些邏輯還在最新的一些項目的推進中得到驗證。應該說從項目一開始就加入ZC Discord並成為MOD的人員來說，對社區還是非常有感情的。拋開感情因素，想客觀的聊一聊ZC怎麼了，儘量的讓一些描述可以準確一些。雖然我也有簽NDA，不過我想我還是相對安全的，因為我努力的做到不知道，這叫做🙉。所以本文是基本基於我的一些觀察和小結，不代表任何項目觀點。\n\n1，ZC社群的構成。我在ZC社群裡認識了很多朋友，素質非常的高，尤其我喜歡去逛自我介紹的欄目，每篇每篇的去看，那裡有一個個ID背後鮮活的靈魂。NFT社區大概的構成主要有肝者，dirty flipper，小白新手，KOL，Fuder，科學家，少量的死忠信仰者、以及運營團隊 mod等，還有大量的超乎想像的bots。這些身分有時候是互相交錯的，就像一個人可以有不同的性格和身分一樣，他們也是動態轉化的。比如藍籌holder們也可以很肝，KOL也可以是dirty flipper，Fuder們只是想拿到低價籌碼，諸如此類，這就是這個社區自由帶來的多元化。ZC社群的構成，起點很高，在項目白名單分配階段，有很多非常高質量的文章，這也讓整個社區充滿了活力和期待。\n\n2，毫無疑問，“肝白”工作室，“打金”工作室對項目的傷害遠遠大於貢獻。因此在ZC早期的社區裡，按照fair launch的理念，mod團隊做了很多anti-bot的工作，這其中包括一人多號，以及手工“肝”的高級bot行為。相比較那些一眼就可以看出來的工作室機器人，手工“肝”是一個比較高級的，又有智商又勤奮工作的行為，他們能夠準確把握團隊選擇偏好，雖然在最後的階段也被偵測出來，但主要考量到1，他們成功獲得了mod的認可，拿到了白名單；2，尊重勞動和尊重規則 ，那些ID的白名單最終得以保留。最多的一個互相關聯的ID，大概拿到了10多個WL，嘆為觀止。NFT項目/社區裡只能觀察到持有地址數，至於有到底有多少個真人holder，這個數量只能估計。ZC項目在anti bot方面，已經盡到了最大的努力，極大的做到了fair launch。我當初的保守的初略估計，45k的社區依然有50%-70%是bots或者重複用戶馬甲小號等等；儘管如此，ZC社區在同向的項目裡，依然是做的很不錯的。但值得注意的是，可能受到了shawn的個人魅力的影響，ZC社區裡新手或者接觸NFT不久的用戶，也佔到了相當大的一部分，我猜想這可能和傳統媒體的幾次宣傳有關係。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0w_VyaEn9gLahmV7wQM5.png?height=412&width=1011)\n\n3，應該說pre launch階段，有一個明確的目標，社區成員之間充滿了緊張又活潑的競爭合作關係，社區的活力非常足，也基本上不存在FUD的情緒。正所謂攻城容易守城難，launch以後的ZC社區面臨了轉型和發展的問題。基本表現為，社區逐漸出現很多FUD和不滿意的聲音，有一些holder高買低賣割肉離場，有一些由愛及恨，FP和成交量量價齊跌，以至於連空投和自己claim都要拿出來fud一下是否大氣。其實社區裡有很多聰明的大腦已經注意到了這些現象，在整理他們的觀察基礎上，我試圖從不同的角度，來分析一下社區目前存在的問題和改進措施：\n\n3\\.1 Launch以前和launch以後社區型態的轉型問題，項目方和社區從買賣關係轉型到合作關係過程：在lauch以前，項目方和社區成員是買賣關係，在賺錢效應的激勵下，不停的有玩家進來社區來試圖獲得白名單，項目方則選擇理想的成員授予白名單，這一切在NFT發行以後，買賣交易完成後，即告一段落了。發行以後，按照web3的敘事，社區holder成了項目的持份者，從買賣關係變成了合作關係。而當下的ZC社區，正處在這樣的轉型期間，似乎項目方與社區成員之間，都需要重新定位找到自己相對舒適的位置。然而雙方思維的慣性，可能是當下社區存在的最大問題。ZC社區在pre launch以前有很清晰的fair launch和donate your brain的概念，在launch以後則變得模糊了，戰略的定位和措施不夠清晰，項目方面又專注於新領域和metaverse的開發，這是目前最大的尷尬階段。一個和尚挑水喝，兩個和尚抬水喝，三個和尚沒水喝。現在的ZC社區大腦們都還在，卻扎扎實實遇到了三個和尚沒水喝的困境。社區的激勵機制的缺乏導致成員參與程度的不夠，項目方扎實推進的項目不受社區認可，社區缺乏新生的力量，這是社區轉型過程中常見的通病，這也在ZC裡也都有了影子；現在的ZC社區就像是一座大金礦，而很多礦工只是站在地面互相指責，沒有人真正的在哪裡挖掘社區的能量和潛力。如何改進？需要所有的holder回到初心上，捫心自問，如果我是zc holder，我為什麼要加入這個社區，我理想的社區是什麼樣的，我希望項目方能夠提供什麼樣的資源和幫助，沒有項目方，我們社區的holder之間可以做些什麼？沒有人可以阻止你想這些問題，而這些建設性的想法，才可能讓ZC重新出發。知道自己需要什麼特別重要，這一點也同樣適用於ZC的core team，需要社區怎麼支持，如何共同建設藍籌初心；\n\n3\\.2 成也founders ，founders就像是蕭何，也在我的購買NFT的核心邏輯裡。我們看到Lok666的明星邊際效應是遞減的，這在DC裡面的666欄目裡的reaction就可以看到。毫無疑問，lok666是zc項目 core中core ，4個founders理解為1+3的配置也是理所當然的。我們從上文知道了，ZC club是一個多元的社區，不像其他明星社區以粉絲為主，這可能也是社區目前存在的一些問題。ZC holders多元的背景，和目前觀察到的lok666的邊際效應相互印證。什麼意思呢？就是ZC holder裡不完全是lok666叔的無腦粉絲，他們有著各種各樣不同的訴求和期望，這種多元化即是優勢，也是目前社區狀態的必然。ZC的team客觀上也無法完全聽到或者滿足這些多元的、有些甚至還是怪異的訴求；lok666依然是zc的靈魂，如何駕馭這個多元社區，對於6叔是個挑戰，對於社區本身，也是一個挑戰，如何重新找到一個舒適的位置？或許經過一些自然選擇的過程，不久的將來ZC們一起聊聊天，喝喝酒，玩玩手錶，看看車，不也是挺舒服的嗎？\n\n3\\.3 一些過往的傷疤。🐟的記憶有三秒，不知道web3的記憶能有多久。OOG 算是一個ZC過往比較大的一個疤痕。這件事情已經有了定論，但每次FUD總少不了。相信其實都從整個事件的發展中學習到了經驗，總結吸取了教訓。如何讓過往的傷疤翻篇，儘管這件事情對holder本身可能沒有太大傷害，但如果阻礙了新鮮力量的加入，那的確還是需要重新思考和評估的。\n\n3\\.4 ZC可能會成為一個DAO組織嗎？我不知道。個人對於DAO非常的有興趣。DAO或許是可以成為ZC的一個出路和解決方案，當然前提是ZC社區重新找回到自己的位置。讓項目方專注於帶領社區進入metaverse，讓社區成為自治組織繼續自由生長，讓ZC成為一塊社區成員自由生長的肥沃土壤，讓資源在社區裡自由公平的流動，讓社區充滿開放包容的自由空氣【包括FUD】，或許是這我所期待的ZC社區。\n\n愛一個人不需要理由，罵一個人也不需要任何藉口。以此篇，獻給ZC club。", "timestamp": 1654663452, "digest": "f6XsBuRHpxXwTDbHGrb4Gjq9Qr41WyHXRm8hyCWKDqA", "contributor": "0xaC2c874f01914C89601abDDc6320ee36bB396D47"}

{"id": "Z0kNaJ9alAnt3b4HGSbe1EOyTcN25-w55QodcIHcPMU", "title": "Growing up in suffering", "body": "Life is the gift of nature and a miracle. All living things in the world are working hard to live their own wonderful life. Suffering is an indispensable scenery in the journey of life, and it is a practice in life. Only through the trials and tribulations can we climb to the peak of the journey of life and reach the other side of the ideal.\n\nAll living things in the world practice and recreate in the midst of suffering, adapt to the ever-changing situation, and strive to become a better version of yourself. It understands the true meaning of all things in the world overcoming suffering, surpassing ourselves, and transforming perfectly; it also enlightens us when we encounter difficulties and twists and turns in life, do not escape, accept suffering, only then can we open a road in the mountains and build bridges in the water; withstand hardships and endure hardships. It is only possible to wait for the beautiful blueprint of \"Liu Yin Hua Ming You Village\" if you have to endure the hardships.\n\nYes, if a small sapling can't stand the raging wind, it can't grow into a towering tree, but die in the cold wind; If the splendid flowers cannot withstand the baptism of the sun and the wind and rain, there will be no ripe fruits hanging on the branches; if the wheat cannot withstand the severe cold of the snow, there will be no golden mats. The ears of wheat nodded in the wind, bringing the joy of harvest; if people can't stand the various hardships and hardships in life, they can't enjoy a good life without food and clothing.\n\nYes, life is a miracle. In the face of hardships, whether it is plants, animals, or people, they all show extraordinary adaptability and resilience. People can survive in desperation, and flowers can be rolled on mountains and rocks. How can you see the rainbow without going through wind and rain, how can you become a great weapon without going through untold hardships, life is a practice in suffering, life is a competition between pain and joy. If you can stand it, you can endure it, you can endure it, you can endure it, you will be reborn as a phoenix, and you will reach the height and breadth of another life.\n\nIf you have not witnessed a young life from birth to growth, you are not qualified to say that life is really precious; if you have not experienced the hardships and hardships in life, you are not qualified to say how wonderful your life is. If you don't try your best to face the hardships in life, you are not qualified to say that I really can't do it; if you encounter hardships in life and choose to escape, you are not qualified to say that life is deceiving Me; if you didn't think that suffering made you who you are now, you have no right to say that God is unfair to you and gave you too little. Perhaps the beauty of life lies in this, with pain and tears, joy and laughter. When encountering difficulties and hardships, it can be viewed with a developmental perspective; when encountering misfortune, it can be treated with a growth mindset. Treat society as a platform for learning, treat life as a life practice, and treat suffering as a driving force for growth. Your life will be a different scene. Another taste, another height.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Id8RGByh2PfTN1lWsYwBu.jpg?height=2560&width=3840)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654663383, "digest": "6EZqN1Z2lykdO30-yeCr6Hy0GZr5BQQKpuoI8EqbfGQ", "contributor": "0x9fB86Eab8FbabEaB84050c5eAD5fD6e66e79bF5e"}

{"id": "OG0OJ4DcvincbESd7IAa-PrwghJyN2a_WpM7lWkqQC4", "title": "Is Zombie Club Dead ？ZC涼涼了嗎？", "body": "Zombie Club跌破發行價了，Is Zombie Club Dead ? \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JS5yidHbIirysqaMWBK4W.png?height=1142&width=1848)\n\n我的回答是，Not yet。我去看了看lok666的IG，還有416萬粉絲；去看了看Zombie Club的twitter，還有58.6K的follower。回憶了一下當初加入ZC的一些基本邏輯：\n\n1，lok666 shawn是明星裡最會玩NFT的，在潮流趨勢和品牌方面有比較大的影響力，有粉絲的基本盤，有流量； \n 2，相比較其他明星的流量收割，ZC定位在智庫和教育方面，獨樹一幟，讓人相信有一些新的期待； \n 3，Founder裡有disco.eth，一個在BAYC和其他社區都很有影響力的大玩家，無論是思想上還是認知上，都是一流的； \n 4，相比較一般的NFT項目，ZC在產業鏈條的佈局上，也頗有計畫和準備，無論是和HTC的合作，還是佈局技術公司上，都屬於較為預見性的規劃。\n\n回過頭去看，這些基本邏輯都還在，有些邏輯還在最新的一些項目的推進中得到驗證。應該說從項目一開始就加入ZC Discord並成為MOD的人員來說，對社區還是非常有感情的。拋開感情因素，想客觀的聊一聊ZC怎麼了，儘量的讓一些描述可以準確一些。雖然我也有簽NDA，不過我想我還是相對安全的，因為我努力的做到不知道，這叫做🙉。所以本文是基本基於我的一些觀察和小結，不代表任何項目觀點。\n\n1，ZC社群的構成。我在ZC社群裡認識了很多朋友，素質非常的高，尤其我喜歡去逛自我介紹的欄目，每篇每篇的去看，那裡有一個個ID背後鮮活的靈魂。NFT社區大概的構成主要有肝者，dirty flipper，小白新手，KOL，Fuder，科學家，少量的死忠信仰者、以及運營團隊 mod等，還有大量的超乎想像的bots。這些身分有時候是互相交錯的，就像一個人可以有不同的性格和身分一樣，他們也是動態轉化的。比如藍籌holder們也可以很肝，KOL也可以是dirty flipper，Fuder們只是想拿到低價籌碼，諸如此類，這就是這個社區自由帶來的多元化。ZC社群的構成，起點很高，在項目白名單分配階段，有很多非常高質量的文章，這也讓整個社區充滿了活力和期待。\n\n2，毫無疑問，“肝白”工作室，“打金”工作室對項目的傷害遠遠大於貢獻。因此在ZC早期的社區裡，按照fair launch的理念，mod團隊做了很多anti-bot的工作，這其中包括一人多號，以及手工“肝”的高級bot行為。相比較那些一眼就可以看出來的工作室機器人，手工“肝”是一個比較高級的，又有智商又勤奮工作的行為，他們能夠準確把握團隊選擇偏好，雖然在最後的階段也被偵測出來，但主要考量到1，他們成功獲得了mod的認可，拿到了白名單；2，尊重勞動和尊重規則 ，那些ID的白名單最終得以保留。最多的一個互相關聯的ID，大概拿到了10多個WL，嘆為觀止。NFT項目/社區裡只能觀察到持有地址數，至於有到底有多少個真人holder，這個數量只能估計。ZC項目在anti bot方面，已經盡到了最大的努力，極大的做到了fair launch。我當初的保守的初略估計，45k的社區依然有50%-70%是bots或者重複用戶馬甲小號等等；儘管如此，ZC社區在同向的項目裡，依然是做的很不錯的。但值得注意的是，可能受到了shawn的個人魅力的影響，ZC社區裡新手或者接觸NFT不久的用戶，也佔到了相當大的一部分，我猜想這可能和傳統媒體的幾次宣傳有關係。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0w_VyaEn9gLahmV7wQM5.png?height=412&width=1011)\n\n3，應該說pre launch階段，有一個明確的目標，社區成員之間充滿了緊張又活潑的競爭合作關係，社區的活力非常足，也基本上不存在FUD的情緒。正所謂攻城容易守城難，launch以後的ZC社區面臨了轉型和發展的問題。基本表現為，社區逐漸出現很多FUD和不滿意的聲音，有一些holder高買低賣割肉離場，有一些由愛及恨，FP和成交量量價齊跌，以至於連空投和自己claim都要拿出來fud一下是否大氣。其實社區裡有很多聰明的大腦已經注意到了這些現象，在整理他們的觀察基礎上，我試圖從不同的角度，來分析一下社區目前存在的問題和改進措施：\n\n3\\.1 Launch以前和launch以後社區型態的轉型問題，項目方和社區從買賣關係轉型到合作關係過程：在lauch以前，項目方和社區成員是買賣關係，在賺錢效應的激勵下，不停的有玩家進來社區來試圖獲得白名單，項目方則選擇理想的成員授予白名單，這一切在NFT發行以後，買賣交易完成後，即告一段落了。發行以後，按照web3的敘事，社區holder成了項目的持份者，從買賣關係變成了合作關係。而當下的ZC社區，正處在這樣的轉型期間，似乎項目方與社區成員之間，都需要重新定位找到自己相對舒適的位置。然而雙方思維的慣性，可能是當下社區存在的最大問題。ZC社區在pre launch以前有很清晰的fair launch和donate your brain的概念，在launch以後則變得模糊了，戰略的定位和措施不夠清晰，項目方面又專注於新領域和metaverse的開發，這是目前最大的尷尬階段。一個和尚挑水喝，兩個和尚抬水喝，三個和尚沒水喝。現在的ZC社區大腦們都還在，卻扎扎實實遇到了三個和尚沒水喝的困境。社區的激勵機制的缺乏導致成員參與程度的不夠，項目方扎實推進的項目不受社區認可，社區缺乏新生的力量，這是社區轉型過程中常見的通病，這也在ZC裡也都有了影子；現在的ZC社區就像是一座大金礦，而很多礦工只是站在地面互相指責，沒有人真正的在哪裡挖掘社區的能量和潛力。如何改進？需要所有的holder回到初心上，捫心自問，如果我是zc holder，我為什麼要加入這個社區，我理想的社區是什麼樣的，我希望項目方能夠提供什麼樣的資源和幫助，沒有項目方，我們社區的holder之間可以做些什麼？沒有人可以阻止你想這些問題，而這些建設性的想法，才可能讓ZC重新出發。知道自己需要什麼特別重要，這一點也同樣適用於ZC的core team，需要社區怎麼支持，如何共同建設藍籌初心；\n\n3\\.2 成也founders ，founders就像是蕭何，也在我的購買NFT的核心邏輯裡。我們看到Lok666的明星邊際效應是遞減的，這在DC裡面的666欄目裡的reaction就可以看到。毫無疑問，lok666是zc項目 core中core ，4個founders理解為1+3的配置也是理所當然的。我們從上文知道了，ZC club是一個多元的社區，不像其他明星社區以粉絲為主，這可能也是社區目前存在的一些問題。ZC holders多元的背景，和目前觀察到的lok666的邊際效應相互印證。什麼意思呢？就是ZC holder裡不完全是lok666叔的無腦粉絲，他們有著各種各樣不同的訴求和期望，這種多元化即是優勢，也是目前社區狀態的必然。ZC的team客觀上也無法完全聽到或者滿足這些多元的、有些甚至還是怪異的訴求；lok666依然是zc的靈魂，如何駕馭這個多元社區，對於6叔是個挑戰，對於社區本身，也是一個挑戰，如何重新找到一個舒適的位置？或許經過一些自然選擇的過程，不久的將來ZC們一起聊聊天，喝喝酒，玩玩手錶，看看車，不也是挺舒服的嗎？\n\n3\\.3 一些過往的傷疤。🐟的記憶有三秒，不知道web3的記憶能有多久。OOG 算是一個ZC過往比較大的一個疤痕。這件事情已經有了定論，但每次FUD總少不了。相信其實都從整個事件的發展中學習到了經驗，總結吸取了教訓。如何讓過往的傷疤翻篇，儘管這件事情對holder本身可能沒有太大傷害，但如果阻礙了新鮮力量的加入，那的確還是需要重新思考和評估的。\n\n3\\.4 ZC可能會成為一個DAO組織嗎？我不知道。個人對於DAO非常的有興趣。DAO或許是可以成為ZC的一個出路和解決方案，當然前提是ZC社區重新找回到自己的位置。讓項目方專注於帶領社區進入metaverse，讓社區成為自治組織繼續自由生長，讓ZC成為一塊社區成員自由生長的肥沃土壤，讓資源在社區裡自由公平的流動，讓社區充滿開放包容的自由空氣【包括FUD】，或許是這我所期待的ZC社區。\n\n愛一個人不需要理由，罵一個人也不需要任何藉口。我眼中的ZC，處在一個社區轉型階段，無論是選擇了哪條道路，都依然生機勃勃。所謂不破不立，否極泰來，只要還有淡水，我們就有希望走的更遠。所以ZC涼涼了嗎？一點也沒有，相反，社區還在螺旋上升🔝的階段，只是需要一點點更多的共識。\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xjingle/status/1534318678824693761?s=20&t=FWMXA4y9CvwapgP0JUbfiQ](https://twitter.com/0xjingle/status/1534318678824693761?s=20&t=FWMXA4y9CvwapgP0JUbfiQ)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654663854, "digest": "f6XsBuRHpxXwTDbHGrb4Gjq9Qr41WyHXRm8hyCWKDqA", "contributor": "0xaC2c874f01914C89601abDDc6320ee36bB396D47"}
{"id": "sNzP94qQ3RdEtlcjcnNNeAxNmk58-u7-0AuaFFSjGJ8", "title": "we are all loved", "body": "That day, I saw such an advertisement on NetEase Cloud: A female college student who just graduated was working in a company, but due to lack of work experience, the plan she wrote was not particularly perfect. One day, the supervisor said fiercely to the female student, \"You Look at the broken plan you wrote! If there are many loopholes, please correct it for me, and if you can’t correct it, don’t leave work today!” The supervisor scolded the girl again, and when the supervisor left, the female colleague next to her comforted her and said, “Another Was murdered? It's okay, it was like this when I first came.\" The girl nodded, but in a blink of an eye, she saw the supervisor nodded and bowed in front of the boss, like a dog.\n\nThe girl curled her lips in dissatisfaction and whispered, \"Bull the soft and fear the hard! She nodded and bowed in front of the boss, like a dog!\" But the girl only saw the supervisor nodding and bowing in front of the boss, but she didn't know that behind the girl who couldn't see, the supervisor In order to keep the girl from being fired by the boss, she nodded and bowed in front of the boss. The supervisor said that the girl was very smart, but she just graduated from college and lacked some experience. She hoped that the boss could give the girl another chance not to fire the girl.\n\nIn fact, there are many very warm cases in life, but these things seem to be very common, but they are actually heart-warming, but we have not paid much attention to them.\n\nTake me as an example, one day when I was bored, I went to chat with a more humorous teacher, and then I followed the teacher, and the teacher was silent for a long time before saying: \"Then invite a 1-pound little bee to go to more. Drink some water.\" I frowned and said, \"Teacher, make sure you understand the key points!\" I'm tricking you, you're a pig! She looked at me for a long time and said, \"Well, I know, your lips are very dry, you need more water...\" At first, I thought she was focusing on the wrong focus, but then I thought about it, it turned out that she cared about me, the focus of attention It's me too, there's a warmth in my heart. Later, I quarreled with her class representative. She knew that in the future, no matter who was at fault, she directly called her class representative to the office and scolded her. She even went out of her way to find out something she didn't know before.\n\nIn fact, these are all secretly told to me by others. She has always been silently loving me behind the scenes that I can't see. I was very moved and said a lot of thanks to her. Later, many people were very envious of me. I was dumbfounded. They just shook their heads and said, \"Don't forget, you are still loved.\"\n\nYes, we seem to have forgotten that there are people in this world who love us silently and carefully. Some seemingly ordinary things are very warm. We always like to see the bad side of things, but we always forget the valuable side. We always see the strictness of teachers and the strictness of parents...but we all forget their love and expectations for us!\n\nI saw a post on the Internet that day, a female teacher who had just graduated from college stood in the class, she scanned every classmate in the class and said, \"I have found that you are better than the previous class during the month I spent with you. Excellent, your class is also very quiet, and your grades are also good... However, none of you are as warm as the previous class. There is one classmate who is warmer than all of you, because she will remind me to take care of myself, and she will also help me Give me medicine when I have a cold... Even if she knows that my physical resistance is not good, she will go online to find out how to increase my resistance, and she will help me block the edge of the desk for me when I am looking for the test paper to prevent me from bumping into it. \"...\" The female teacher choked up as she spoke, her eyes moist. And all the classmates below you look at me, I look at you, but none of them went up to comfort the female teacher.\n\n\"I just hope you can understand that we are all loved.\" After saying that, the teacher started to cry...\n\nDear people, a lot of love is hidden in the heart, but those loves are too deep, but it does not mean that no one loves us, I hope you will always remember that no matter strangers, there are always people in this world who are in love us! We are all loved too!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/McXzdJ25h7kNiab8ehFfw.jpg?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654663697, "digest": "YhGaWWv-Vzhvsyw3bV8T4RIRVi8hfvgQbYU_m6nLxRU", "contributor": "0x7589DaFEB02b168e95E409f2343B1fd64BFc4689"}

14 世纪的意大利扎根。它以每个人的个人潜力和自由能力为中心，呼吁庆祝智力成就。强大的美第奇家族，当时的佛罗伦萨统治者，接受了这场运动，并领导了意大利资产阶级支持艺术和文化的冲锋。再加上古腾堡印刷机的发明，这一时期见证了文艺复兴：欧洲艺术、科学和文化的生动重生。\n\n> *区块链和 NFT 空间已经为艺术和文化的爆发做好了准备。*\n\n让我们推翻 NFT 是富人玩物的说法。该声明背后的真相来自这样一个事实，即由于投资的性质、法定转换的痛苦以及缺乏加密销售点系统，无法轻易花掉令人难以置信的加密鲸财富。这里需要一个警告：这是一个庞大的资金池，除了 NFT 之外，不能轻易花在很多钱上。这不一定是坏事——每一次文化革命都需要意大利富有的支持者。NFT 领域是历史上第一次我们看到艺术、社区、尖端技术的交叉点，以及接触如此巨大的自由流动性。在这样的环境下，一场完美的艺术文化风暴正在酝酿，一场属于我们自己的现代文艺复兴。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KCtQBcaQdzXYpCOStZKd6.png?height=700&width=1400)\n\n# 人们为什么要购买艺术品，为什么要购买 NFT？\n\n对艺术 NFT 的一个常见贬义是，除了下一个人愿意为它支付的费用之外，它们没有任何价值。假设这个说法是正确的，那么花费 6930 万美元购买 Beeple 产品的人就创下了有史以来最糟糕的交易记录。但同样的批评也适用于传统艺术。达芬奇的《救世主》是如何以*4.503*亿美元的价格售出，或者安迪·沃霍尔的*《Shot Sage Blue Marilyn*》以 1.95 亿美元的价格售出的？\n\n迈克尔·芬德利（Michael Findlay）在他的著作*[《艺术的价值：金钱、权力、美丽》 ](https://lfpress.com/2013/02/20/what-gives-a-work-of-art-its-value#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20concluded%20that%20what%20gives,important%20%E2%80%94%20originality%20and%20quality.%E2%80%9D)*中断言，这完全取决于供求关系。\n\n> *“无论是真实的还是想象的，当艺术品出售时，稀有性是净加超。它不仅证明了价格合理，而且还暗示了一个专属的所有权俱乐部。”*\n\n在同一本书中，Findlay 讲述了与资深艺术品经销商 William Acquavella 的对话，后者告诉他的客户“你可以重新赚钱，但不能重新制作这幅画。” Findlay 直截了当地翻译。以这个价格购买作品的机会只存在一次，当它消失时——它消失了。\n\n现在，任何 NFT 交易者都会熟悉这两个主题。FOMO（害怕错过）现象导致许多交易者购买价格过高的 NFT，认为这是他们在它迅速变得无法负担之前购买它的最后机会。对于富有、稀有和昂贵的艺术品，也早已成为身份的象征。一位英国老贵族在将他的推特头像设置为罕见的 BAYC 时，从在壁炉上欣赏莫奈的客人那里得到的满足感与加密鲸鱼（用于对持有大量加密货币的人进行分类的非正式术语）相同.\n\n因此，可收藏的 NFT 可以归类为 Veblen 商品。凡勃伦商品是价格上涨时需求增加的商品。像设计师珠宝或劳力士这样的产品，由于其令人难以置信的价格标签而被高度觊觎为身份象征，就是很好的例子。\n\n当然，艺术品和 NFT 都是出于其他原因购买的。首先，人们购买艺术品是为了艺术——他们欣赏艺术背后的美感或工艺。其次，他们这样做可能是为了支持艺术家或它可能支持的事业（想到慈善拍卖）。\n\n我们通过比较购买艺术品的心理和社会动机，确立了艺术品 NFT 价值的合法性。很明显，对艺术 NFT 的需求确实存在，并将继续健康地存在。买家可以安全地花钱，创作者可以继续将区块链技术整合到他们的作品中。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ywcL8hU9f1thurx0kP--j.png?height=1400&width=1400)\n\n \n NFT 如何使艺术家受益并让创作变得更容易？\n\n饥饿艺术家的想法在我们的社会中根深蒂固，甚至有[自己的维基百科页面](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starving_artist)。不幸的是，对于艺术家来说，艺术毕业生的平均工资通常排在最后，视觉和美术艺术家以及音乐家的平均工资为 40,000 美元（相比之下，工程领域的平均工资为 100,000 美元）。一个可悲的事实是，虽然艺术品收藏家和经销商往往过着奢侈的生活，但大多数艺术家却在贫困中苦苦挣扎。\n\n在我们之前的文章中，我们谈到了 NFT 技术如何通过内置版税帮助艺术家享受他们二级市场销售的一部分。艺术家在铸造 NFT 时，可能会在代码中包含一个智能合约，将转售的百分比发送到他们指定的钱包。\n\n虽然很简单，但这给艺术家带来的好处是巨大的。特许权使用费的征收传统上是不透明的，行政成本高且繁琐。\n\n> *[Ivors Academy 报告称](https://ivorsacademy.com/news/data-issues-are-at-the-heart-of-half-a-billion-pounds-a-year-of-unallocated-or-misallocated-streaming-royalties-for-songwriters-and-rightsholders/)，来自流媒体服务的糟糕数据在 2020 年使艺术家损失了超过 6 亿美元。*\n\n英国议会向政府提出建议，将元数据附加到歌曲中，以建立最低可行数据标准并审计“黑匣子”版税。这让人们明白，按照现行版税标准造成的收入损失对艺术来说是至关重要的。\n\n即使完全透明，音乐家也只能赚取音乐带来的一小部分收入。大部分资金流向了流媒体服务和唱片公司等中间商。流媒体平台 Spotify 为自己保留 25%，并向唱片公司支付 59.9%。唱片公司负责营销和出版（以及其他），然后根据他们与艺术家签订的合同支付剩余的款项。之后，艺人的经理会减薪（通常为 15-20%）。只有一小部分原始人像最终进入了艺术家的口袋。\n\n即便如此，厂牌和艺人之间的合同仍然是片面的。它在实践中的运作方式是，艺术家与唱片公司达成协议，通过出售他们音乐的版权来换取一笔预付款。鉴于机构的主导地位，除非你是超级明星，否则不难想象唱片公司在谈判合同时的权力平衡。同样的把关也发生在视觉艺术中，作为艺术画廊和出版商存在。\n\n这就是 NFT 发挥作用的地方。NFT 为音乐家提供了超越常规的巨大优势。首先，铸币厂可以作为音乐家的种子轮融资。现在有了资金来资助他们的工作，艺术家们在谈判合同时不再需要接受繁重的要求。拥有一个稳固的粉丝社区可以通过多种方式赋予艺术家权力。1000[名忠实粉丝](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)文章指出，对于一个艺术家来说，拥有一千名粉丝，每人花费 100 美元，从而在给定年份净赚 100,000 美元是很现实的。拥有一个粉丝社区作为投资者还可以通过其他方式赋予艺术家权力，例如促销和营销，从而减少对唱片公司等营销人员的需求。此外，这使艺术家可以直接与他们最忠实的支持者建立联系，并使建立关系变得容易。\n\n> *对艺术家的另一个激励是他们可以分享版税。*\n\n虽然 NFT 不会自动授予版权或音乐版税（仅链上所有权认证），但 Royal 和 Audius 等平台的目标是在歌曲播放时自动分配版税。Audius 以 500 万美元的融资成为头条新闻，Katy Perry、Pusha T 和 Jason Derulo 等超级巨星倾注了他们的精力（和金钱）。基于区块链的流媒体平台真正准备好颠覆 Spotify 和 iTunes 等传统巨头。\n\n元宇宙革命对于崭露头角的艺术家来说是天赐之物。Metaverses 是虚拟世界，需要人们开发它们。从 VFX 艺术家到音响工程师，具有创造能力的人都将在职业生涯中获得成功。一些元节，如 Enviro，采用艺术画廊的形式。艺术家不再受时间或空间等不便的束缚，现在能够向全球观众展示他们的作品。\n\n说到全球推广，NFT 让传统上贫穷艺术场景的人们发展成为艺术家。以前，艺术家可能会通过搬到巴黎等昂贵的文化中心来为自己的职业生涯做出牺牲，但现在他们享受了空间无限的延伸。\n\n这不是 NFT 实现艺术多样性的唯一方式。较小的目标受众较少受到主要利益在于盈利的公司机构的关注。例如，与针对广泛受众的项目相比，风险资本家不太可能选择专门针对非裔美国人的项目。这背后的原因是它的目标受众较小。NFT 允许艺术家直接接触他们的社区，而无需通过这些看门人。这使社区和以多样性为中心的艺术蓬勃发展。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DqGEoEWSfZ06Xh6pyUV9Q.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n# 艺术、文化和 NFT——它们是如何相互关联的？\n\n艺术不仅仅是画布上的笔触。它可以是对现实的描述，也可以是情感的交流，甚至是表情。它反映了我们周围的社会，讲述了我们的故事。\n\n另一方面，文化被理解为不同人的独特生活方式，以及他们用符号表达经验的能力。例如，枫树是加拿大文化的代表，就像和服是日本文化的象征一样。\n\n> *艺术和文化存在于一个相互影响的循环中。艺术，作为社会集体记忆的缓存，在形成社区文化方面发挥着重要作用——随着时间的推移，它会改变观点、灌输价值观并让经验永垂不朽。*\n\n展望未来，NFT 将在这个周期中发挥作用。降低进入艺术的门槛、实现公平支付并为艺术家提供强大的支持者——将促进一场艺术革命。同时，NFT 也将重新唤起公众对艺术的兴趣（由于其易于获取），这将增加艺术对文化的影响。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j7tv8RuB68AVshul_vH40.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\n# 结论\n\n在过去的几十年里，人类见证了前所未有的高水平生产力或创新。原因很简单：我们已经从过去专注于通过笨重的机械进行工业生产转向现在，信息的生产和管理至高无上。进入成本很低——任何拥有笔记本电脑的人都可以参与。\n\n同样，当艺术界的传统进入壁垒和守门人被克服时，我们将看到人类创造力的狂热；通过不同的媒介涌入的情感故事。这将塑造整个社区的文化景观，使我们走向一个更加相互联系、更善解人意的世界。

等平台的目标是在歌曲播放时自动分配版税。Audius 以 500 万美元的融资成为头条新闻，Katy Perry、Pusha T 和 Jason Derulo 等超级巨星倾注了他们的精力（和金钱）。基于区块链的流媒体平台真正准备好颠覆 Spotify 和 iTunes 等传统巨头。\n\n元宇宙革命对于崭露头角的艺术家来说是天赐之物。Metaverses 是虚拟世界，需要人们开发它们。从 VFX 艺术家到音响工程师，具有创造能力的人都将在职业生涯中获得成功。一些元节，如 Enviro，采用艺术画廊的形式。艺术家不再受时间或空间等不便的束缚，现在能够向全球观众展示他们的作品。\n\n说到全球推广，NFT 让传统上贫穷艺术场景的人们发展成为艺术家。以前，艺术家可能会通过搬到巴黎等昂贵的文化中心来为自己的职业生涯做出牺牲，但现在他们享受了空间无限的延伸。\n\n这不是 NFT 实现艺术多样性的唯一方式。较小的目标受众较少受到主要利益在于盈利的公司机构的关注。例如，与针对广泛受众的项目相比，风险资本家不太可能选择专门针对非裔美国人的项目。这背后的原因是它的目标受众较小。NFT 允许艺术家直接接触他们的社区，而无需通过这些看门人。这使社区和以多样性为中心的艺术蓬勃发展。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DqGEoEWSfZ06Xh6pyUV9Q.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n# 艺术、文化和 NFT——它们是如何相互关联的？\n\n艺术不仅仅是画布上的笔触。它可以是对现实的描述，也可以是情感的交流，甚至是表情。它反映了我们周围的社会，讲述了我们的故事。\n\n另一方面，文化被理解为不同人的独特生活方式，以及他们用符号表达经验的能力。例如，枫树是加拿大文化的代表，就像和服是日本文化的象征一样。\n\n> *艺术和文化存在于一个相互影响的循环中。艺术，作为社会集体记忆的缓存，在形成社区文化方面发挥着重要作用——随着时间的推移，它会改变观点、灌输价值观并让经验永垂不朽。*\n\n展望未来，NFT 将在这个周期中发挥作用。降低进入艺术的门槛、实现公平支付并为艺术家提供强大的支持者——将促进一场艺术革命。同时，NFT 也将重新唤起公众对艺术的兴趣（由于其易于获取），这将增加艺术对文化的影响。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j7tv8RuB68AVshul_vH40.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\n# 结论\n\n在过去的几十年里，人类见证了前所未有的高水平生产力或创新。原因很简单：我们已经从过去专注于通过笨重的机械进行工业生产转向现在，信息的生产和管理至高无上。进入成本很低——任何拥有笔记本电脑的人都可以参与。\n\n同样，当艺术界的传统进入壁垒和守门人被克服时，我们将看到人类创造力的狂热；通过不同的媒介涌入的情感故事。这将塑造整个社区的文化景观，使我们走向一个更加相互联系、更善解人意的世界。

It's hard to find knowledge. In one life, one knowledge is enough. And the confidante knows already, it is more to meet and not ask.\n\nThere is a saying: Those who can have a confidante must be a wise man among men, and those who can be a confidante must be the best among women. Right now, people in Man Street are looking for what to do with blue and red faces, and the feelings between people are delicate and subtle. Who can understand? ! And the confidante knows already, it is more to meet and not ask. I once thought I had it, but it turned out to be empty.\n\nA man who knows what he already has died, and a woman who is happy with him, is easy to obtain, but hard to find if he knows what he already has. From ancient times to the present, it seems that everyone is looking for a soulmate in the dark world. Who can really find a soulmate? Who can truly resonate with themselves? In everyone's life, it is impossible to keep words, deeds, deeds, and deeds the same. Even we can't fully understand our own psychology, and how dare we expect others to understand us.\n\nA person's life cannot be smooth sailing, nor can everything be perfect. After going through the vicissitudes of life, life has made us without any edges and corners. Maybe there is a little depression in our heart, maybe a little trouble, I don't want to say it to my other half, but I just want to say it to my own knowledge.\n\nNot everyone can meet a known one. What is a known one? Generally, they are friends of the opposite sex. Is there really a pure friendship between men and women? I don't know this. Knowing is a very delicate relationship. It is between love and friendship. The next step is a lover, and the next step is a stranger. It’s hard to grasp this kind of measure, because when you want to tell your thoughts to you, it is often when you encounter troubles in your life. When people are in pain and sadness, they are the most helpless. Your people, your heart is undefended and most easily moved. Maybe when you are most vulnerable, knowing has become a lover, and friendship will transition into love.\n\nIs there really any knowledge in the network? How far can this feeling go? How long will this relationship last? How long can we stay on each other's Q? How long does it take us to forget the feeling of knowing each other? What kind of feeling is there between you and you? Unclear, unclear, more than friendship, less than love. Now I rarely chat online, I don't have that mood anymore, I don't have that feeling anymore.\n\nThere are always many disappointments in life, and it is so difficult to have a loved one! Acquaintance is a kind of fate, no matter how far this relationship can go, and cherish today's fate! It is already rare to have a confidant, and it is even more rare to find a confidante.\n\nLife is a kind of predestined relationship, and so are feelings. The things you deliberately pursue may not be available for the rest of your life, but the brilliance you never expected will come unexpectedly in your indifference...\n\nIn the depths of loneliness, no one knows, and he laughs at the drunken poet;\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gd6I9vOTJ8BtHIXmREhA4.jpg?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654664074, "digest": "-0JXbiGAdH7zP7EONHSk17w2IggvwFplBS7OzEmM9Ts", "contributor": "0x7fA062a316d0484dFBCb4C3C0bc9F1004d347CCA"}

{"id": "8PrBCGY-UgJ_OvNQTJubow-w6xwIMsojbCaBZKYEUp4", "title": "most precious friendship", "body": "Life is like a dream, time is like a song. Thousands of worlds, the red dust is rolling, the ups and downs year after year, a few smiles, a few traces of sadness, with the flow of time, many people and things are lost, but there is a kind of people who change with time. As time goes on, your interaction with him (her) is like the fragrance of aged wine, which is refreshing. Your friendship with him or her is the most precious emotion in the world. This kind of friendship is the purest, noblest, simplest and most ordinary feeling, and also the most romantic, moving, solid and eternal feeling. Whether in life or on the Internet, everyone will have friends. If there is no friendship, there will be no pleasant harmony in life, just like a pool of dead water; friendship is everywhere, she accompanies you, lingers around you, and You spend a lifetime together.\n\nThe most precious friendship What is a friend? Friends are people who are friends with each other, people who are good to each other. However, \"people's acquaintance is the most important thing in each other's acquaintance; people's acquaintance is the most important thing in knowing each other.\" In terms of making friends, the ancients paid attention to not going against the heart, so they were friends with each other.\n\nLu Xun also said: \"It is enough to have a confidant in life, and the world should treat it with the same heart.\" \"Fame, honor, happiness, and wealth, if compared with friendship, they are all dust.\" Darwin said this.\n\nOnly by fate can we meet, and only by heart can we know each other. It is fate that friends can meet each other, come together, get to know each other, understand each other, and get close to each other. In the life journey of people coming and going, gathering and separation, on their different life trajectories, in the heart sea of ​​different experiences, it can be said that it is a kind of luck to meet each other, get together, and meet each other. Fate is not always there. Yes, you should cherish the hard-won fate.\n\nGetting along with friends is a process of mutual recognition, mutual admiration, mutual appreciation and mutual perception. The other party's advantages, strengths, highlights, and beauty will be reflected in your mind, and you will have a panoramic view. Even a little precious friend will become your upward energy, and become the motivation and source of your lifelong benefits. The wisdom, knowledge, ability, passion of a friend is the magnetism and force that draws you close. At the same time, everything about you is also a process of friend recognition and perception. The most important thing among friends is to treat each other with sincerity. If you are sincere, you will leave them. If you are doubtful, you will leave them. Those who are selfish and have bad intentions may wish to abandon them.\n\nSincere friendship is eternal. \"People can't always be on time. When you are behind the times, someone still understands you, which is a confidant.\"\n\nThe most important thing between friends is to forgive each other. \"Good people are good people.\" The advantages of friends should not be avoided but not learned; Or biased views, as long as they are kind to themselves, they can't be angry and ridiculed.\n\nA person, in order to gain more sincere friendship, in addition to being sincere to his friends, he must also be able to tolerate each other's shortcomings, pay attention to how he behaves, and live up to his friend's confidant.\n\n\"It's rare to have a confidant in life, and a confidant is the hardest to find throughout the ages.\" I think this is also a kind of chance in life, which can be met but cannot be found. It is a great blessing in life to have a \"Three Changes\" gentleman who \"looks like, is gentle, and listens to his words\" as a confidant!\n\nIt's hard to say how much you are in my heart! Just know that the journey of life cannot be without you! In the wind and rain of life, friends can protect you from the wind and cold, share your sorrows for you, and solve your pain and difficulties. Friends will always extend a hand of friendship. She is an escalator when you ascend, a good medicine when you are injured, a bowl of boiled water when you are hungry and thirsty, and a boat when you cross the river; she cannot be bought by money, nor by orders.

So, we conducted in-depth research to prevent such things. At the same time, with our in-depth research on ERC721QS and the inspiration from the latest papers of E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Vitalik Buterin, we found that its application scenarios is greatly beyond our imagination and even can solve the difficult problems in Web3 industry. Mr. FAN and 0007.eth also provide us with inspiration.We are very grateful to them!\n\n**Advantages**\n\nMake NFT holders safer ,protect their interests, and retrieve losses in case of account theft.\n\nReduce hackers’ benefits, so that they can return to the normal track and work with us to promote faster progress in the industry.\n\nNew NFT projects can adopt this mechanism to reduce the risk of NFT theft and improve own security.\n\nPrevious NFT projects can consider upgrading the contract to reduce user’s insecurity (recommended).\n\nApplicable to NFT leasing scenarios.\n\nFind the soul of Web3 and solve the problem of SBT design mechanism.\n\n**Core Problems Solved**\n\nHackers no longer benefit from theft.\n\nNot only to prevent NFT theft, but also to retrieve NFT in a safe and harmless way when NFT may be stolen.\n\nTake NFT lease support in consideration in contract.\n\nPropose the design mechanism of SBT.\n\n**NFT Anti-theft Contract ：ERC721QS-1P**\n\nERC721QS-1 is our basic version, but it is not considered optimal and we will not show it anymore. Later, we made further improvements and proposed the ERC721QS-1P.\n\n**Role or Address Settings**\n\n**Ward**: The holder of NFT, generally the wallet address of NFT. When the Guardian address and quantity are empty, the Ward can transfer NFT or set the Guardian address and quantity. However, when the Guardian address already exists in NFT, the Ward cannot modify the Guardian address and quantity without the permission of the Guardian, and cannot transfer NFT.\n\n**Guardian**: The NFT Guardian is generally the NFT owner’s cold wallet or trusted address. **The Guardian can remove its Guardian identity by itself, or when the NFT Ward address is abnormal, call the NFT smart contract, burn the original NFT, and re-mint the NFT with the same Token ID to the specified address.**\n\n**Possible Operations Related to the Two Roles**\n\n**Mint NFT**: Operated by the Ward.\n\n**Transfer NFT**: Operated by the Ward, but can only be carried out when NFT has no Guardian. Before NFT transfers, the smart contract will verify whether the NFT has a Guardian address. If so, it will refuse to initiate the transfer; If not, the transfer can be operated.\n\n**Set Guardian**: Set by the Ward. Please note that the Ward can only set the address and quantity of the Guardian when the Guardian address is empty. When NFT already has a Guardian, the Ward cannot change the address and quantity of the Guardian. The Ward can only set the two when the NFT does not have any Guardian(s). When there is a Guardian, the Ward cannot transfer NFT.\n\n**Remove Guardian**: Operated by the Guardian. When the Ward address wants to transfer NFT, all Guardians need to remove their Guardian identities.\n\n**Burn the original NFT in the Ward address and re-mint a new NFT and transfer it to the specified address( the old and new NFT has the same Token ID)** : Operated by the Guardian. After the Ward has set the Guardian, when the private key of the Ward address is unfortunately disclosed or lost, there will be no loss to anyone due to NFT transfer because the original NFT cannot be transferred by the Ward at this time. At this time, the Guardian calls the smart contract to burn the original NFT in the Ward address and re-mint a new NFT ,and then the new one will be transferred to the specified address. The old and new NFT has the same Token ID , the new NFT’s metadata link points to that of the original one. Therefore, the new NFT has the same properties as the original one. When a new NFT is generated, the Guardian of the original NFT may lose its value, and the Ward of the new NFT can reset one or more Guardians (or retain the original Guardian setting when a new NFT is generated).\n\n**After an NFT sets the Guardian address, it can generate several scenarios.**\n\nThe Ward has authorized an unsafe smart contract or the private key has been stolen by hackers: At this time, the NFT has a Guardian. When the hacker requests to transfer the NFT in the Ward address, the action will be rejected by the smart contract, and the hacker cannot steal the NFT. When the NFT owner realizes that his/her authorization is dangerous or his/her private key has been disclosed, his/her has time to cancel the authorization of the unsafe smart contract or directly burn the original NFT through the Guardian address, and generates a new one with the same Token ID.\n\nTransfer NFT: The Guardian needs to remove its Guardian identity. When the address and quantity of NFT Guardian are empty, the Ward can transfer NFT.\n\n**Supplement**\n\n**ENS has designed a re-registration mechanism for expired ENS using a similar approach. We also found inspiration from it and improved the ERC721QS-1P.Below is an example.**\n\n**<https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf5a4f4039c7e5690f220d2752fe83efd5ca37e61137b5334ea968e0c859a8483>**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WUHBa1zrUtmy5_dPJ6Tqe.png?height=349&width=865)\n\n**NFT Anti-theft and NFT Lease Contract: ERC721QS-2**\n\n**Role or Address settings**\n\n**Ward:** The Ward address. The holder of NFT, generally the wallet address of NFT. When the Guardian address and quantity are empty, the Ward can transfer NFT, or set the Guardian address and quantity. When the Guardian address already exists in NFT, the Ward cannot modify the Guardian address and quantity without the permission of the Guardian, and cannot transfer NFT.\n\n**Guardian:** The Guardian address. The NFT Guardian is generally the NFT holder’s cold wallet or trusted address. The Guardian can remove its Guardian identity by itself, or call the NFT smart contract to transfer the NFT to the specified address after the Ward address where the NFT is located is abnormal.\n\n**Possible Operations Related to the Two Roles**\n\n**Mint NFT**: Operated by the Ward.\n\n**Transfer NFT**:\n\n1. Operated by the Ward, but can only be carried out when NFT has no Guardian. Before NFT transfers, the smart contract will verify whether the NFT has a Guardian. If so, it will refuse to initiate the transfer; If not, the transfer can be operated.\n2. Operated by the Guardian. When the NFT has a Guardian, with the permission of all the Guardian(s), the NFT can be transferred to a specific address.\n\n**Set Guardian:** Set by the Ward. Please note that the Ward can only set the address and quantity of the Guardian when the Guardian address is empty. When NFT already has a Guardian, the Ward cannot change the address and quantity of the Guardian. The Ward can only set the two when the NFT does not have any Guardian(s). When there is a Guardian, the Ward cannot transfer NFT.\n\n**Remove  Guardian:** Operated by the Guardian. When the Ward address wants to transfer NFT, all Guardians need to remove their Guardian identity.\n\n**Ward address is unavailable, the NFT needs to be transferred**: Operated by the Guardian. After the Ward has set the Guardian, when the private key of the Ward address is unfortunately disclosed or lost, there will be no loss to anyone due to NFT transfer because the NFT cannot be transferred by the Ward then. At this time, the Guardian calls the smart contract to transfer the NFT to a new address.\n\n**After an NFT sets the Guardian address, it can generate several scenarios.**\n\nThe Ward has authorized an unsafe smart contract or the private key has been stolen by hackers: At this time, the NFT has a Guardian. When the hacker requests to transfer the NFT at the Ward address, the action will be rejected by the smart contract, and the hacker cannot steal the NFT. When user realizes that the authorization is dangerous or the private key has been disclosed, the user has time to cancel  the authorization of the unsafe smart contract or directly transfer the NFT to a specific new safe address through the Guardian.\n\n**Transfer NFT** (especially if it needs to be transferred to others, such as selling on OpenSea): The Guardian address needs to remove  its Guardian identity. When the address and quantity of NFT Guardian are empty, the Ward can transfer NFT.\n\n**An analogy**: When NFT needs to be transferred to others or sold, we consider that NFT needs to form a new family like a child grows up, so the current Guardian should let go.\n\n**Further Improvements**:\n\nWhen the Ward sets the Guardian, it can set the validity period or expiration time of the Guardian. After the expiration, the Guardian setting can be automatically removed, and the Ward then can transfer NFT. It is a way to retrieve NFT due to problems such as the loss of the Guardian private key.\n\nWhen part of Guardians agrees, the NFT can be transferred. If 4 Guardians are set, the NFT can be transferred with the permission of 3 of them.\n\n**NFT lease and NFT mortgage lending**\n\nThis mechanism opens a channel for the opening of NFT lease market. By separating the holding right from the transfer right, the actual owner can set several Guardian addresses to control the transfer right. When will be a lease, the actual owner can transfer the NFT to the lessee address (Further, the Guardian can set the transfer time interval, for example 3 months. On this occasion, within 3 months, the Guardian cannot call the smart contract to transfer the NFT in order to protect the interests of the lessee). At the same time, in order to combine with potential NFT lease platform cases in the future, the Guardian roles can be granted to individuals, smart contracts, or a combination of both.\n\nAt the same time, it also proposes a new NFT mortgage lending model.\n\n**Supplements**\n\nGuardian address setting is very flexible, which makes it possible for the contract of different application directions and scenarios, and is also compatible with some future NFT application scenarios. We have more casual article, named “100 Ways to Play with Guardian Address”, which will be continuously improved for reference. For example, we think of a very interesting scenario: if you want to become a diamond hand of a certain NFT, you can set an expiration time for the Guardian and set some special addresses. Within the expiration, you will not sell your NFT due to the psychological pressure caused by market fluctuations.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/5660.eth/0TKe6Ere091ZuGWN1QEzyB6FFyjun42c0BYVSLrsHWQ](https://mirror.xyz/5660.eth/0TKe6Ere091ZuGWN1QEzyB6FFyjun42c0BYVSLrsHWQ)\n\nWithout a Guardian, the operation of NFT following ERC721QS contract is no different from the current ordinary NFT operation.\n\nSetting a Guardian does increase the user’s capital cost and operation steps. Thus, this needs to be weighed by the holder. For example, for high-value NFT, if the holder prefers to hold it for a long time (multiple signatures is also a way to store NFT, but it is less operable, more unfriendly to users, and cannot meet some NFT use scenarios, such as NFT lease, NFT mortgage lending, etc.), the user can set a Guardian. For low-value NFT, user may not be willing to set a Guardian. However, we cannot judge the NFT value to a holder only from the price. Perhaps an NFT without market value is also very important to the holder, such as the NFT made of photos or videos of important moments in his/her life. The holder can also set a Guardian for this kind of NFT. At the same time, since NFT is in a static state most of the time, the transfer frequency is not high. Therefore, when NFT needs to be transferred, the Guardian identity setting can be removed. With the significant improvement of asset security, the reduction of operation convenience has little impact.\n\nA new type of fraud may occur, that is, an unethical Guardian makes an offline transaction with the purchaser, transfers the NFT to the purchaser’s address, and transfers it out after receiving the payment, thus achieving the purpose of fraud.\n\nSolution: In the perspective of contract or NFT smart contract, we can consider making a clear distinction and tip on the display for NFTs with and without Guardian settings. For industry participants, such as NFT viewing platforms or NFT trade platforms, the above two can be divided into different categories for display and operation. In addition, the main way of NFT transaction is still through NFT trade platforms, and transaction completed on the platforms will not occur in such cases of fraud. We believe that offline transaction has higher trust requirements for both parties, and it is more difficult for fraudsters to obtain illegal income in this way. However, out of the interests of users, we need to take fraud prevention into our consideration.\n\nThe contract is usually recommended to be written into NFT smart contract, and also in upgrading issued NFT smart contract.\n\n**Other Proposals (but not good enough at present)**\n\n**Mortgage Appeal**: Once the holder’s NFT is stolen, he/she can file a theft appeal to an organization (such as the DAO set up by the project party), but it requires a certain amount of mortgage deposit. If the organization affirms that the appeal of the original holder is successful, the holder will take back his/her own NFT or obtain a new NFT with same properties, and refund the deposit (the organization may charge a fee for the services of the appellant to incentivize those involved in judging the appeal). If the organization affirms that the appeal fails, the holder’s deposit will be confiscated.\n\nBlockchain Police DAO or Judge Dao: If Web3 forms such a credible organization in the future, it can connect the NFT smart contract to the Oracle of the organization, and the organization will determine whether there is theft, restrict and treat the stolen assets to a certain extent.\n\n**Challenger Research Opinions**\n\nBlockchain is decentralized, but not de-justified. Maintaining people’s security needs is the key to promoting more people to participate and use the blockchain.\n\nWeb2 governs hackers through administrative and legal means, but often has poor results at present. Web3 actually lacks an effective way to govern hackers, but we can reduce the benefits of hackers. In fact, hackers form a very strong security team and development organization. We can attract them to do things that are beneficial to the blockchain industry, rather than only doing things that harm the industry interests through reward plans or flexible recruitment methods that satisfy them.\n\nAfter this contract released, there were many technical discussions. We hope you will not only consider issues from the perspective of technology, but also switch identities and consider the necessity of this set of contracts from the perspective of different blockchain industry participants.\n\n**SBT Design Mechanism: ERC721QS-3**\n\nQS-3 is based on the improvement of QS-2. In fact, because the setting of Guardian address is very flexible, the so-called SBT (we prefer to call it identity proof NFT, but it seems that SBT is more widely used, so we won’t distinguish it in detail in QS-3). We only need to make some adjustments to the QS-2 mechanism. Adjustments are as follows:\n\n1. The SBT can be issued with a Guardian role. SBTs of the same series can have the same Guardian. At this time, the Ward can mint NFT, but has no transfer right after mint. Or the Ward doesn’t need to mint SBT, and SBT is distributed directly by Guardian.\n2. The Guardian(s) can together reset a new Guardian (introduce new members, like the expansion of the company’s management), or remove the identity of a Guardian (eliminate a member, such as a member’s death or lack of due diligence).\n3. The performance period of different Guardian(s) can be different, and it does not need to start immediately. A Guardian can work in the future (for example, the identity of the new member elected by the parliament has been determined, but has not yet entered the performance cycle).\n4. Optional. Turn off the Ward’s transfer permission. That is, even if all Guardian(s) remove their identity by themselves (like the company’s bankruptcy and dissolution), the Ward still cannot transfer the NFT or SBT.\n\nFor example, a Harvard bachelor’s degree SBT. When a Harvard student successfully passes the oral defense and graduates, **the Guardian of the University transfers the degree SBT with unique code to his/her address**, which proves that he/she graduated from the University and obtained his/her bachelor’s degree. He/she can prove that he/she has obtained a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University by verifying the ownership of wallet, which can be used in job hunting, social networking and other scenarios. If the private key of the address is disclosed or lost, the student can apply to the school, and **the University Guardian will transfer his/her degree SBT to a new address**. If the student is later found to have academic misconduct or acts contrary to the purposes of Harvard University, **the University Guardian can also withdraw the degree SBT**. For this SBT, students only have the right to use, but not the right of transfer or transaction. Because the value of this degree SBT comes from the endorsement of Harvard University, the University has important rights to its distribution and transfer.\n\n**Role or Address Settings**\n\n**Ward**: The holder of SBT (such as a university degree certificate, a company CEO identity certificate, a country President identity certificate, or a credit commitment certificate), generally the wallet address of SBT. When the Guardian address already exists in SBT, the Ward cannot modify the Guardian address and quantity without the permission of the Guardian, and cannot transfer SBT. When the Guardian address and quantity are empty, the Ward can transfer SBT and set the Guardian address and quantity.\n\n**Guardian:** The Guardian of SBT, generally refers to several addresses of corresponding social organizations or individuals (such as a university, a company board of directors, a country Parliament, a bank, a DAO), or addresses trusted by SBT holders (such as credit guarantors). The Guardian can remove its Guardian identity by itself (e.g., resignation). SBT can be added or removed the Guardian(s) with the permission of a specified number of Guardian(s). The Guardian can call SBT smart contract and transfer the SBT to a specified address .\n\n**Possible Operations Related to the Two Roles**\n\n**Mint SBT**: Operated by the Ward. Or the Ward doesn’t need to mint SBT. After the SBT is generated by smart contract, it is directly controlled and distributed by the Guardian.\n\n**Transfer SBT**:\n\n1. Operated by the Guardian. When the SBT has Guardian(s), with the permission of all or part of the Guardian(s), the SBT can be transferred to a specified address.\n2. Operated by the Ward, but can only be carried out when SBT has no Guardian. Before SBT transfers, the smart contract will verify whether the SBT has a Guardian address. If so, it will refuse to initiate the transfer; If not, the transfer can be operated (Optional, can be turned off).\n\n**Set Guardian**: When the SBT is initially issued, the Guardian is set by the smart contract. Or set by the Ward after the SBT is transferred to the Ward address.\n\n**Add or Remove Guardian:**\n\nWith the permission of a specified number of Guardian(s), SBT can be added or removed Guardian(s).\n\nIn addition, different Guardian(s) can have different time period for performing their duties, and it is not necessary to perform their duties at the current timing. A Guardian may perform its duties in the future.\n\n**Remove** **Guardian**: Operated by the Guardian by itself.\n\n**Ward address is unavailable, the SBT needs to be transferred to new address**: Operated by the Guardian. When the private key of the Ward address is unfortunately disclosed or lost, there will be no loss to anyone due to SBT transfer because the SBT cannot be transferred by the Ward at this time (but caution should be taken, there may be the possibility of SBT being used fraudulently). At this time, the Guardian calls the smart contract to transfer the SBT to a new address.\n\n**Upgrade SBT**\n\nIf the Guardian needs to upgrade the original SBT smart contract to issue a new SBT (for example, change the ID card or make the university diploma more artistic). The Guardian does not need to notify the Ward and requires the Ward to perform some complex operations. The Guardian only needs to take a snapshot of the address held by the original SBT, and then issue a new SBT to the Ward. The original SBT can also be retrieved from the Ward address if the Guardian considers necessary. Or do not take it back as a souvenir of the Ward.\n\n**Challenger Research Opinion**\n\nThe more Guardians, the more complex composition of members, the more difficult operation and the higher cost. This is true in design, but it is not worth criticizing because it conforms to sociological theory. For higher-value SBT (for example, “President identity SBT”), the Guardian should be more cautious in transferring the SBT to a specified address, and gas expenditure is also a necessary governance cost to avoid the abuse and excessive issuance of SBT. For low-value SBT, such as the issuance of invitations to an informal party, you can only set one Guardian. If the goal is to reduce operation cost, we can also build it on layer 2 or even layer 3 (this concept was first proposed by Stark Net. Unlike layer 2, layer 3 is more flexible and can only be used for a wide range of or important specific purposes and meet special needs, such as possible privacy needs of SBT in the future). Alternatively, consider a new public blockchain. However, at present, we think that we can study the need to use layer 2, layer 3 or establish a new public blockchain, but it is not urgent. There are two reasons: first, the market demand for SBT has not been fully expanded, and the functional demand for SBT also needs to be further studied; Second, with the implementation of ETH 2.0, the performance of ETH main network has also been improved.\n\nQS-3 gives the Guardian greater authority, which puts forward higher requirements for the governance of Guardian organization itself. This organization can be a parliament, a company, or a newly emerging DAO. The Guardian governance is a problem worthy of in-depth study. There are also many Web3 governance methods being introduced, such as the “Triangle Structure” and “Mutually Assured Destruction Mechanism” proposed by us using Game Theory. The industry can carry out deeper discussion and research in this perspective.\n\nThrough further design, under a certain mechanism, the SBT address only with the right of use can also become the Guardian of another SBT. For example, the Guardian, a national citizenship certification authority, grants “citizenship SBT” to citizens, but in the direct presidential election, the addresses holding citizenship SBT can become the voter Guardian. Voters can vote for a presidential candidate (call the smart contract to transfer the “President identity SBT” or “designate President SBT” to a candidate’s address). When a candidate’s address is supported by enough voters, the “President identity SBT” will be automatically transferred to his/her address. After holding the “President identity SBT”, the candidate will unlock a series of relevant permissions by virtue of the “President identity SBT”, such as military command, authorization of nuclear weapons use, etc. (If the SBT may have such rights in the future, you will understand that it is fairly reasonable to make operation of transferring some SBTs to the designated address more complex and cautious.)\n\nFor the production and issuance of SBT, we should design a simpler and more convenient way. For example, design a website. When a party initiator wants to make an SBT as his/her party invitation, he/she just needs to log in to the website, connect his/her wallet address, enter the Guardian address, and enter the name, content, and quantity of the SBT to be generated. Then he/she can generate the SBT as wanted. If he/she wants to transfer the SBT to a party participant, he/she can also operate on this website; Or if he/her wants to make some new friends, he/she will remove the Guardian identity and allow SBT to transfer freely. The progressiveness of technology and the popularity of technology are not necessarily linked. The link between the two is usability and convenience.\n\n**Enhance Privacy and Security QS-X**\n\nIn QS-1P, QS-2 and QS-3, the Guardian’s identity is public, and their operation behavior is public too, which may be detrimental to protect the Guardian’s privacy and security. For example, under the pressure of public opinion and power, the Guardian may make choices that do not conform to his/her own wishes. If the Guardian needs privacy protection and security, we can further improve it by adopting technologies such as MPC or Zero-knowledge proof. This can be used in such scenarios as secret ballot and anonymous billionaire club charity fund.\n\nQs-1 is our basic version, but we don't think it is the best. It is attached below for reference. We hope it can bring you new inspiration.\n\n**Supplements**\n\nIt should be noted that in ERC721QS, due to the addition of support for use scenarios such as NFT lease, NFT mortgage lending and SBT, the NFT holder is not necessarily the owner of the NFT ownership, the holder can be the lessee, lender and user.\n\nWe note that some EIPs are committed to solving NFT lease problem, but after research, we believe that they do not conform to the practice in real society. For example, one approach is to use the NFT lease smart contract. The owner will pledge the NFT into the lease smart contract address, and then give the lessee user identity. Technically, it works, but it is not in line with the real leaser and lessee relationship. For example, this is equivalent to the tenant signing a lease contract with the landlord (through the smart contract). We can prove the landlord (owner)’s identity through the property certificate and the tenant (user)’s identity through the lease contract. However, we did not give the apartment key to the tenant. The tenant proved that he/she had the right to use the apartment by holding the lease contract to tell everyone that I signed a lease contract and paid the money. The apartment is not in the hands of the landlord or the tenant, but in the hands of a third party (NFT lease smart contract address). This sounds very strange.\n\nSomeone has proposed a simple SBT design, that is, using the existing ERC721 contract to generate SBT, but turn off the owner’s transfer right to SBT (but there is no QS-3 design mentioned that the Guardian can transfer the SBT). This design also does not meet some application scenarios in reality. For example, the Harvard University Bachelor’s degree SBT mentioned above. If a Harvard University student is found to have academic misconduct, in theory, the bachelor’s degree should be withdrawn, but the above method is impossible. Therefore, this Harvard University graduate with academic misconduct can still have the Bachelor’s degree SBT and continue to cheat. This will have a negative impact on the reputation of Harvard University.\n\nResearch Support：By Challenger Research, Epochs Labs，Web3 技术小组\n\n**About Challenger Research (CR)**\n\nCR is a loose but united, non-profit organization composed of Web3 industry researchers. The core value of the organization is to challenge people’s cognition of Web3 and release the powerful potential of the Web3 world. Web3 is constantly evolving (**not progress, but evolution**). CR think that most people’s understanding of Web3 is not accurate and complete at present, and industry researchers need to continuously conduct in-depth research and update the public’s understanding. Its organization name “Challenger” comes from the wrecked US space shuttle “Challenger”. Although Web3’s world exploration is full of failure possibility, CR is still willing to be a pioneer. CR does not deliberately pursue anonymity, but it still will not disclose the organization members, their work and research. New researchers can join CR publicly or anonymously, and we also accept contributions in various forms. CR will conduct some interesting experiments later. For example, when ERC721QS-3 or QS-X contract is adopted, we will generate CR-SBT to verify the researcher’s identity, and determine the researcher’s proposal and qualification to participate in possible meetings.\n\nTemporary contact: 5660.eth\n\nSearch 5660.eth on Blockscan Chat and start the conversation\n\n[https://chat.blockscan.com/index](https://chat.blockscan.com/index)\n\nKnow about our recent experiment projects and more details to be disclosed:\n\n[https://linktr.ee/10kuniverse](https://linktr.ee/10kuniverse)\n\nAttachment: Soundbound Tokens paper participated by Vitalik: “Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul”\n\nEnglish version: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763>\n\nChinese version: <https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/1652665746121864.html>", "timestamp": 1654664680, "digest": "x3B-VnEmEem0soMVyd1Nueob7jYnaqTxghOs58drzlc", "contributor": "0x648E7865bDfAC56c0233a9999206867725ecE54D"}

This is the idea behind the character design.\n\n## Story\n\nAn adventure story about wack and his friends, who love music, and their search for a \"stone tablet engraved with sound\" that they discovered by chance.\n\n\\*Crave reviews are in the works! To be released soon!\n\n# Thoughts on this project\n\nThe web3 movement, which seeks a new way of society with the advent of programmable technology, including in the real world, reminded me of the excitement of infinite possibilities of what might happen in the free and somewhat dangerous communication with people who had never met before in the early days of the Internet. It reminded me of the excitement of the endless possibilities of what might happen in free and somewhat dangerous communication with people who had never met before at the dawn of the Internet.\n\nHowever, as web3 is being sought for social implementation (or commercialization) in the world to date, I feel that the distorted aspects of web3 are beginning to come full circle.\n\nI usually respect people/projects that create new values and experiences that do not yet exist in the world, and I enjoy and like a world where many such things emerge.\n\nThrough this project, I hope to provide the excitement and new experiences that web3 has to offer, even if only in a small way, and that is why I launched this project.\n\nI would also be happy if this project can be a starting point to start a project to create new values and experiences by further developing ideas based on this project.\n\nIn order to help this, we plan to release the illustrations and music in CC0.\n\nWe also plan to release ai data (data that can be re-edited) for the illustrations and track data (data that can be re-edited) for the music, so please take advantage of these data when they are released.\n\n# Proposal for a New Viewing Experience\n\nEver since the gramophone appeared in human history (probably), music has developed from analog records to tapes to CDs to streaming.\n\nStreaming, in particular, has spread widely as a very convenient way to listen to music at any time for free. (There are more than 500 million users!!!).\n\nThis is proof that the experience of listening to music today is no longer a very light and rare thing.\n\nSo, what would happen if we set a hurdle to the experience of listening to music? I was driven to try a viewing experience called .\n\nIn a society so saturated with music, even if such music existed, it would be forgotten without ever being heard or even being noticed.\n\nBut I wanted to try it because it sounded interesting.\n\nSpecifically, this is how I envision it working.\n\n1️⃣Split a piece of music into 5 parts per phrase\n\n2️⃣ NFT each of them\n\n3️⃣ Each of the 5 NFT holders must come together to view the complete piece\n\n4️⃣ People invited by NFT holders at the time of viewing can view without NFTs\n\n\\*One person cannot watch even if he/she has all types of NFTs\n\n\\*There are tracks, phrases, gimmicks, etc. that only exist when completed, so piecing together the phrases that can be viewed on the OS will not result in a finished product.\n\n\\*I am sure that this viewing experience will not work without an experience that surpasses that of a normal song, because of the increased rarity.\n\nI don't expect this project to be generalized, nor do I think it will solve the problems faced by the artists or the industry.\n\nWe simply hope that through the wackwackwack characters and their worldview, people will feel the Internet-like experience of doing one thing/spending time together with a stranger.\n\n# An aside\n\nI like music.\n\nI like listening to it and playing it.\n\nI also like businesses related to music. (Although I haven't been able to do it myself.) I respect the artists and the industry as a whole.\n\nI respect artists and the industry as a whole.\n\nThe web3 community is being exploited because the value of music has decreased with the advent of streaming services, or because the return to the artists is low. The NFT will help to regain the value of the music. However, considering the world before the emergence of streaming services, I don't necessarily think that streaming services = evil.\n\nHowever, I do agree with the movement to bring artists and fans closer together, which is being talked about in the web3 community.\n\nI also agree with the movement to make the relationship between artist and fan deeper and wider.\n\nWhat I wanted to say was not that something is evil, but that service counties are just tools, and it depends on the user.\n\nHowever, the industry structure and business practices, as well as the behavioral psychology and principles of the fans that shape them, have become a way of life and culture, so it is not easy for fans to accept an experience other than the existing structure of streaming music for free (or for a small fee) and casually listening to music, and as a result, artists are suffering. This is a situation that is causing artists to suffer.\n\nAs a result, the web3 community is searching for ways to provide benefits to fans as well.\n\nThere have already been some success stories, but there are many examples of artists who have had a certain level of success with the existing structure.\n\nHowever, I believe that by the end of this year, values and experiences will emerge from the web3 area, where the wisdom of the world is gathered, that will make the relationship between artist⇔fan⇔fan even deeper and wider.\n\nI am sure that the key will be the strengthening of the passion-based fan ⇔ fan, and a system whereby this is returned to the artist side as well.\n\nAs a music lover, I am thinking about what kind of new experience this will be, and I am also looking forward to seeing the wonderful inventions that will come out of other sources.\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)", "timestamp": 1654664663, "digest": "i23WDbBiW8B8h4FVZBbQApRZLvCh7AFvPrE4O0npYBs", "contributor": "0xa2095b4E90659e12A4E069ebF84C30cb33d9A0b1"}

So, we conducted in-depth research to prevent such things. At the same time, with our in-depth research on ERC721QS and the inspiration from the latest papers of E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Vitalik Buterin, we found that its application scenarios is greatly beyond our imagination and even can solve the difficult problems in Web3 industry. Mr. FAN and 0007.eth also provide us with inspiration.We are very grateful to them!\n\n**Advantages**\n\nMake NFT holders safer ,protect their interests, and retrieve losses in case of account theft.\n\nReduce hackers’ benefits, so that they can return to the normal track and work with us to promote faster progress in the industry.\n\nNew NFT projects can adopt this mechanism to reduce the risk of NFT theft and improve own security.\n\nPrevious NFT projects can consider upgrading the contract to reduce user’s insecurity (recommended).\n\nApplicable to NFT leasing scenarios.\n\nFind the soul of Web3 and solve the problem of SBT design mechanism.\n\n**Core Problems Solved**\n\nHackers no longer benefit from theft.\n\nNot only to prevent NFT theft, but also to retrieve NFT in a safe and harmless way when NFT may be stolen.\n\nTake NFT lease support in consideration in contract.\n\nPropose the design mechanism of SBT.\n\n**NFT Anti-theft Contract ：ERC721QS-1P**\n\nERC721QS-1 is our basic version, but it is not considered optimal and we will not show it anymore. Later, we made further improvements and proposed the ERC721QS-1P.\n\n**Role or Address Settings**\n\n**Ward**: The holder of NFT, generally the wallet address of NFT. When the Guardian address and quantity are empty, the Ward can transfer NFT or set the Guardian address and quantity. However, when the Guardian address already exists in NFT, the Ward cannot modify the Guardian address and quantity without the permission of the Guardian, and cannot transfer NFT.\n\n**Guardian**: The NFT Guardian is generally the NFT owner’s cold wallet or trusted address. **The Guardian can remove its Guardian identity by itself, or when the NFT Ward address is abnormal, call the NFT smart contract, burn the original NFT, and re-mint the NFT with the same Token ID to the specified address.**\n\n**Possible Operations Related to the Two Roles**\n\n**Mint NFT**: Operated by the Ward.\n\n**Transfer NFT**: Operated by the Ward, but can only be carried out when NFT has no Guardian. Before NFT transfers, the smart contract will verify whether the NFT has a Guardian address. If so, it will refuse to initiate the transfer; If not, the transfer can be operated.\n\n**Set Guardian**: Set by the Ward. Please note that the Ward can only set the address and quantity of the Guardian when the Guardian address is empty. When NFT already has a Guardian, the Ward cannot change the address and quantity of the Guardian. The Ward can only set the two when the NFT does not have any Guardian(s). When there is a Guardian, the Ward cannot transfer NFT.\n\n**Remove Guardian**: Operated by the Guardian. When the Ward address wants to transfer NFT, all Guardians need to remove their Guardian identities.\n\n**Burn the original NFT in the Ward address and re-mint a new NFT and transfer it to the specified address( the old and new NFT has the same Token ID)** : Operated by the Guardian. After the Ward has set the Guardian, when the private key of the Ward address is unfortunately disclosed or lost, there will be no loss to anyone due to NFT transfer because the original NFT cannot be transferred by the Ward at this time. At this time, the Guardian calls the smart contract to burn the original NFT in the Ward address and re-mint a new NFT ,and then the new one will be transferred to the specified address. The old and new NFT has the same Token ID , the new NFT’s metadata link points to that of the original one. Therefore, the new NFT has the same properties as the original one. When a new NFT is generated, the Guardian of the original NFT may lose its value, and the Ward of the new NFT can reset one or more Guardians (or retain the original Guardian setting when a new NFT is generated).\n\n**After an NFT sets the Guardian address, it can generate several scenarios.**\n\nThe Ward has authorized an unsafe smart contract or the private key has been stolen by hackers: At this time, the NFT has a Guardian. When the hacker requests to transfer the NFT in the Ward address, the action will be rejected by the smart contract, and the hacker cannot steal the NFT. When the NFT owner realizes that his/her authorization is dangerous or his/her private key has been disclosed, his/her has time to cancel the authorization of the unsafe smart contract or directly burn the original NFT through the Guardian address, and generates a new one with the same Token ID.\n\nTransfer NFT: The Guardian needs to remove its Guardian identity. When the address and quantity of NFT Guardian are empty, the Ward can transfer NFT.\n\n**Supplement**\n\n**ENS has designed a re-registration mechanism for expired ENS using a similar approach. We also found inspiration from it and improved the ERC721QS-1P.Below is an example.**\n\n**<https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf5a4f4039c7e5690f220d2752fe83efd5ca37e61137b5334ea968e0c859a8483>**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WUHBa1zrUtmy5_dPJ6Tqe.png?height=349&width=865)\n\n**NFT Anti-theft and NFT Lease Contract: ERC721QS-2**\n\n**Role or Address settings**\n\n**Ward:** The Ward address. The holder of NFT, generally the wallet address of NFT. When the Guardian address and quantity are empty, the Ward can transfer NFT, or set the Guardian address and quantity. When the Guardian address already exists in NFT, the Ward cannot modify the Guardian address and quantity without the permission of the Guardian, and cannot transfer NFT.\n\n**Guardian:** The Guardian address. The NFT Guardian is generally the NFT holder’s cold wallet or trusted address. The Guardian can remove its Guardian identity by itself, or call the NFT smart contract to transfer the NFT to the specified address after the Ward address where the NFT is located is abnormal.\n\n**Possible Operations Related to the Two Roles**\n\n**Mint NFT**: Operated by the Ward.\n\n**Transfer NFT**:\n\n1. Operated by the Ward, but can only be carried out when NFT has no Guardian. Before NFT transfers, the smart contract will verify whether the NFT has a Guardian. If so, it will refuse to initiate the transfer; If not, the transfer can be operated.\n2. Operated by the Guardian. When the NFT has a Guardian, with the permission of all the Guardian(s), the NFT can be transferred to a specific address.\n\n**Set Guardian:** Set by the Ward. Please note that the Ward can only set the address and quantity of the Guardian when the Guardian address is empty. When NFT already has a Guardian, the Ward cannot change the address and quantity of the Guardian. The Ward can only set the two when the NFT does not have any Guardian(s). When there is a Guardian, the Ward cannot transfer NFT.\n\n**Remove  Guardian:** Operated by the Guardian. When the Ward address wants to transfer NFT, all Guardians need to remove their Guardian identity.\n\n**Ward address is unavailable, the NFT needs to be transferred**: Operated by the Guardian. After the Ward has set the Guardian, when the private key of the Ward address is unfortunately disclosed or lost, there will be no loss to anyone due to NFT transfer because the NFT cannot be transferred by the Ward then. At this time, the Guardian calls the smart contract to transfer the NFT to a new address.\n\n**After an NFT sets the Guardian address, it can generate several scenarios.**\n\nThe Ward has authorized an unsafe smart contract or the private key has been stolen by hackers: At this time, the NFT has a Guardian. When the hacker requests to transfer the NFT at the Ward address, the action will be rejected by the smart contract, and the hacker cannot steal the NFT. When user realizes that the authorization is dangerous or the private key has been disclosed, the user has time to cancel  the authorization of the unsafe smart contract or directly transfer the NFT to a specific new safe address through the Guardian.\n\n**Transfer NFT** (especially if it needs to be transferred to others, such as selling on OpenSea): The Guardian address needs to remove  its Guardian identity. When the address and quantity of NFT Guardian are empty, the Ward can transfer NFT.\n\n**An analogy**: When NFT needs to be transferred to others or sold, we consider that NFT needs to form a new family like a child grows up, so the current Guardian should let go.\n\n**Further Improvements**:\n\nWhen the Ward sets the Guardian, it can set the validity period or expiration time of the Guardian. After the expiration, the Guardian setting can be automatically removed, and the Ward then can transfer NFT. It is a way to retrieve NFT due to problems such as the loss of the Guardian private key.\n\nWhen part of Guardians agrees, the NFT can be transferred. If 4 Guardians are set, the NFT can be transferred with the permission of 3 of them.\n\n**NFT lease and NFT mortgage lending**\n\nThis mechanism opens a channel for the opening of NFT lease market. By separating the holding right from the transfer right, the actual owner can set several Guardian addresses to control the transfer right. When will be a lease, the actual owner can transfer the NFT to the lessee address (Further, the Guardian can set the transfer time interval, for example 3 months. On this occasion, within 3 months, the Guardian cannot call the smart contract to transfer the NFT in order to protect the interests of the lessee). At the same time, in order to combine with potential NFT lease platform cases in the future, the Guardian roles can be granted to individuals, smart contracts, or a combination of both.\n\nAt the same time, it also proposes a new NFT mortgage lending model.\n\n**Supplements**\n\nGuardian address setting is very flexible, which makes it possible for the contract of different application directions and scenarios, and is also compatible with some future NFT application scenarios. We have more casual article, named “100 Ways to Play with Guardian Address”, which will be continuously improved for reference. For example, we think of a very interesting scenario: if you want to become a diamond hand of a certain NFT, you can set an expiration time for the Guardian and set some special addresses. Within the expiration, you will not sell your NFT due to the psychological pressure caused by market fluctuations.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/5660.eth/0TKe6Ere091ZuGWN1QEzyB6FFyjun42c0BYVSLrsHWQ](https://mirror.xyz/5660.eth/0TKe6Ere091ZuGWN1QEzyB6FFyjun42c0BYVSLrsHWQ)\n\nWithout a Guardian, the operation of NFT following ERC721QS contract is no different from the current ordinary NFT operation.\n\nSetting a Guardian does increase the user’s capital cost and operation steps. Thus, this needs to be weighed by the holder. For example, for high-value NFT, if the holder prefers to hold it for a long time (multiple signatures is also a way to store NFT, but it is less operable, more unfriendly to users, and cannot meet some NFT use scenarios, such as NFT lease, NFT mortgage lending, etc.), the user can set a Guardian. For low-value NFT, user may not be willing to set a Guardian. However, we cannot judge the NFT value to a holder only from the price. Perhaps an NFT without market value is also very important to the holder, such as the NFT made of photos or videos of important moments in his/her life. The holder can also set a Guardian for this kind of NFT. At the same time, since NFT is in a static state most of the time, the transfer frequency is not high. Therefore, when NFT needs to be transferred, the Guardian identity setting can be removed. With the significant improvement of asset security, the reduction of operation convenience has little impact.\n\nA new type of fraud may occur, that is, an unethical Guardian makes an offline transaction with the purchaser, transfers the NFT to the purchaser’s address, and transfers it out after receiving the payment, thus achieving the purpose of fraud.\n\nSolution: In the perspective of contract or NFT smart contract, we can consider making a clear distinction and tip on the display for NFTs with and without Guardian settings. For industry participants, such as NFT viewing platforms or NFT trade platforms, the above two can be divided into different categories for display and operation. In addition, the main way of NFT transaction is still through NFT trade platforms, and transaction completed on the platforms will not occur in such cases of fraud. We believe that offline transaction has higher trust requirements for both parties, and it is more difficult for fraudsters to obtain illegal income in this way. However, out of the interests of users, we need to take fraud prevention into our consideration.\n\nThe contract is usually recommended to be written into NFT smart contract, and also in upgrading issued NFT smart contract.\n\n**Other Proposals (but not good enough at present)**\n\n**Mortgage Appeal**: Once the holder’s NFT is stolen, he/she can file a theft appeal to an organization (such as the DAO set up by the project party), but it requires a certain amount of mortgage deposit. If the organization affirms that the appeal of the original holder is successful, the holder will take back his/her own NFT or obtain a new NFT with same properties, and refund the deposit (the organization may charge a fee for the services of the appellant to incentivize those involved in judging the appeal). If the organization affirms that the appeal fails, the holder’s deposit will be confiscated.\n\nBlockchain Police DAO or Judge Dao: If Web3 forms such a credible organization in the future, it can connect the NFT smart contract to the Oracle of the organization, and the organization will determine whether there is theft, restrict and treat the stolen assets to a certain extent.\n\n**Challenger Research Opinions**\n\nBlockchain is decentralized, but not de-justified. Maintaining people’s security needs is the key to promoting more people to participate and use the blockchain.\n\nWeb2 governs hackers through administrative and legal means, but often has poor results at present. Web3 actually lacks an effective way to govern hackers, but we can reduce the benefits of hackers. In fact, hackers form a very strong security team and development organization. We can attract them to do things that are beneficial to the blockchain industry, rather than only doing things that harm the industry interests through reward plans or flexible recruitment methods that satisfy them.\n\nAfter this contract released, there were many technical discussions. We hope you will not only consider issues from the perspective of technology, but also switch identities and consider the necessity of this set of contracts from the perspective of different blockchain industry participants.\n\n**SBT Design Mechanism: ERC721QS-3**\n\nQS-3 is based on the improvement of QS-2. In fact, because the setting of Guardian address is very flexible, the so-called SBT (we prefer to call it identity proof NFT, but it seems that SBT is more widely used, so we won’t distinguish it in detail in QS-3). We only need to make some adjustments to the QS-2 mechanism. Adjustments are as follows:\n\n1. The SBT can be issued with a Guardian role. SBTs of the same series can have the same Guardian. At this time, the Ward can mint NFT, but has no transfer right after mint. Or the Ward doesn’t need to mint SBT, and SBT is distributed directly by Guardian.\n2. The Guardian(s) can together reset a new Guardian (introduce new members, like the expansion of the company’s management), or remove the identity of a Guardian (eliminate a member, such as a member’s death or lack of due diligence).\n3. The performance period of different Guardian(s) can be different, and it does not need to start immediately. A Guardian can work in the future (for example, the identity of the new member elected by the parliament has been determined, but has not yet entered the performance cycle).\n4. Optional. Turn off the Ward’s transfer permission. That is, even if all Guardian(s) remove their identity by themselves (like the company’s bankruptcy and dissolution), the Ward still cannot transfer the NFT or SBT.\n\nFor example, a Harvard bachelor’s degree SBT. When a Harvard student successfully passes the oral defense and graduates, **the Guardian of the University transfers the degree SBT with unique code to his/her address**, which proves that he/she graduated from the University and obtained his/her bachelor’s degree. He/she can prove that he/she has obtained a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University by verifying the ownership of wallet, which can be used in job hunting, social networking and other scenarios. If the private key of the address is disclosed or lost, the student can apply to the school, and **the University Guardian will transfer his/her degree SBT to a new address**. If the student is later found to have academic misconduct or acts contrary to the purposes of Harvard University, **the University Guardian can also withdraw the degree SBT**. For this SBT, students only have the right to use, but not the right of transfer or transaction. Because the value of this degree SBT comes from the endorsement of Harvard University, the University has important rights to its distribution and transfer.\n\n**Role or Address Settings**\n\n**Ward**: The holder of SBT (such as a university degree certificate, a company CEO identity certificate, a country President identity certificate, or a credit commitment certificate), generally the wallet address of SBT. When the Guardian address already exists in SBT, the Ward cannot modify the Guardian address and quantity without the permission of the Guardian, and cannot transfer SBT. When the Guardian address and quantity are empty, the Ward can transfer SBT and set the Guardian address and quantity.\n\n**Guardian:** The Guardian of SBT, generally refers to several addresses of corresponding social organizations or individuals (such as a university, a company board of directors, a country Parliament, a bank, a DAO), or addresses trusted by SBT holders (such as credit guarantors). The Guardian can remove its Guardian identity by itself (e.g., resignation). SBT can be added or removed the Guardian(s) with the permission of a specified number of Guardian(s). The Guardian can call SBT smart contract and transfer the SBT to a specified address .\n\n**Possible Operations Related to the Two Roles**\n\n**Mint SBT**: Operated by the Ward. Or the Ward doesn’t need to mint SBT. After the SBT is generated by smart contract, it is directly controlled and distributed by the Guardian.\n\n**Transfer SBT**:\n\n1. Operated by the Guardian. When the SBT has Guardian(s), with the permission of all or part of the Guardian(s), the SBT can be transferred to a specified address.\n2. Operated by the Ward, but can only be carried out when SBT has no Guardian. Before SBT transfers, the smart contract will verify whether the SBT has a Guardian address. If so, it will refuse to initiate the transfer; If not, the transfer can be operated (Optional, can be turned off).\n\n**Set Guardian**: When the SBT is initially issued, the Guardian is set by the smart contract. Or set by the Ward after the SBT is transferred to the Ward address.\n\n**Add or Remove Guardian:**\n\nWith the permission of a specified number of Guardian(s), SBT can be added or removed Guardian(s).\n\nIn addition, different Guardian(s) can have different time period for performing their duties, and it is not necessary to perform their duties at the current timing. A Guardian may perform its duties in the future.\n\n**Remove** **Guardian**: Operated by the Guardian by itself.\n\n**Ward address is unavailable, the SBT needs to be transferred to new address**: Operated by the Guardian. When the private key of the Ward address is unfortunately disclosed or lost, there will be no loss to anyone due to SBT transfer because the SBT cannot be transferred by the Ward at this time (but caution should be taken, there may be the possibility of SBT being used fraudulently). At this time, the Guardian calls the smart contract to transfer the SBT to a new address.\n\n**Upgrade SBT**\n\nIf the Guardian needs to upgrade the original SBT smart contract to issue a new SBT (for example, change the ID card or make the university diploma more artistic). The Guardian does not need to notify the Ward and requires the Ward to perform some complex operations. The Guardian only needs to take a snapshot of the address held by the original SBT, and then issue a new SBT to the Ward. The original SBT can also be retrieved from the Ward address if the Guardian considers necessary. Or do not take it back as a souvenir of the Ward.\n\n**Challenger Research Opinion**\n\nThe more Guardians, the more complex composition of members, the more difficult operation and the higher cost. This is true in design, but it is not worth criticizing because it conforms to sociological theory. For higher-value SBT (for example, “President identity SBT”), the Guardian should be more cautious in transferring the SBT to a specified address, and gas expenditure is also a necessary governance cost to avoid the abuse and excessive issuance of SBT. For low-value SBT, such as the issuance of invitations to an informal party, you can only set one Guardian. If the goal is to reduce operation cost, we can also build it on layer 2 or even layer 3 (this concept was first proposed by Stark Net. Unlike layer 2, layer 3 is more flexible and can only be used for a wide range of or important specific purposes and meet special needs, such as possible privacy needs of SBT in the future). Alternatively, consider a new public blockchain. However, at present, we think that we can study the need to use layer 2, layer 3 or establish a new public blockchain, but it is not urgent. There are two reasons: first, the market demand for SBT has not been fully expanded, and the functional demand for SBT also needs to be further studied; Second, with the implementation of ETH 2.0, the performance of ETH main network has also been improved.\n\nQS-3 gives the Guardian greater authority, which puts forward higher requirements for the governance of Guardian organization itself. This organization can be a parliament, a company, or a newly emerging DAO. The Guardian governance is a problem worthy of in-depth study. There are also many Web3 governance methods being introduced, such as the “Triangle Structure” and “Mutually Assured Destruction Mechanism” proposed by us using Game Theory. The industry can carry out deeper discussion and research in this perspective.\n\nThrough further design, under a certain mechanism, the SBT address only with the right of use can also become the Guardian of another SBT. For example, the Guardian, a national citizenship certification authority, grants “citizenship SBT” to citizens, but in the direct presidential election, the addresses holding citizenship SBT can become the voter Guardian. Voters can vote for a presidential candidate (call the smart contract to transfer the “President identity SBT” or “designate President SBT” to a candidate’s address). When a candidate’s address is supported by enough voters, the “President identity SBT” will be automatically transferred to his/her address. After holding the “President identity SBT”, the candidate will unlock a series of relevant permissions by virtue of the “President identity SBT”, such as military command, authorization of nuclear weapons use, etc. (If the SBT may have such rights in the future, you will understand that it is fairly reasonable to make operation of transferring some SBTs to the designated address more complex and cautious.)\n\nFor the production and issuance of SBT, we should design a simpler and more convenient way. For example, design a website. When a party initiator wants to make an SBT as his/her party invitation, he/she just needs to log in to the website, connect his/her wallet address, enter the Guardian address, and enter the name, content, and quantity of the SBT to be generated. Then he/she can generate the SBT as wanted. If he/she wants to transfer the SBT to a party participant, he/she can also operate on this website; Or if he/her wants to make some new friends, he/she will remove the Guardian identity and allow SBT to transfer freely. The progressiveness of technology and the popularity of technology are not necessarily linked. The link between the two is usability and convenience.\n\n**Enhance Privacy and Security QS-X**\n\nIn QS-1P, QS-2 and QS-3, the Guardian’s identity is public, and their operation behavior is public too, which may be detrimental to protect the Guardian’s privacy and security. For example, under the pressure of public opinion and power, the Guardian may make choices that do not conform to his/her own wishes. If the Guardian needs privacy protection and security, we can further improve it by adopting technologies such as MPC or Zero-knowledge proof. This can be used in such scenarios as secret ballot and anonymous billionaire club charity fund.\n\nQs-1 is our basic version, but we don't think it is the best. It is attached below for reference. We hope it can bring you new inspiration.\n\n**Supplements**\n\nIt should be noted that in ERC721QS, due to the addition of support for use scenarios such as NFT lease, NFT mortgage lending and SBT, the NFT holder is not necessarily the owner of the NFT ownership, the holder can be the lessee, lender and user.\n\nWe note that some EIPs are committed to solving NFT lease problem, but after research, we believe that they do not conform to the practice in real society. For example, one approach is to use the NFT lease smart contract. The owner will pledge the NFT into the lease smart contract address, and then give the lessee user identity. Technically, it works, but it is not in line with the real leaser and lessee relationship. For example, this is equivalent to the tenant signing a lease contract with the landlord (through the smart contract). We can prove the landlord (owner)’s identity through the property certificate and the tenant (user)’s identity through the lease contract. However, we did not give the apartment key to the tenant. The tenant proved that he/she had the right to use the apartment by holding the lease contract to tell everyone that I signed a lease contract and paid the money. The apartment is not in the hands of the landlord or the tenant, but in the hands of a third party (NFT lease smart contract address). This sounds very strange.\n\nSomeone has proposed a simple SBT design, that is, using the existing ERC721 contract to generate SBT, but turn off the owner’s transfer right to SBT (but there is no QS-3 design mentioned that the Guardian can transfer the SBT). This design also does not meet some application scenarios in reality. For example, the Harvard University Bachelor’s degree SBT mentioned above. If a Harvard University student is found to have academic misconduct, in theory, the bachelor’s degree should be withdrawn, but the above method is impossible. Therefore, this Harvard University graduate with academic misconduct can still have the Bachelor’s degree SBT and continue to cheat. This will have a negative impact on the reputation of Harvard University.\n\nResearch Support：By Challenger Research, Epochs Labs，Web3 技术小组\n\n**About Challenger Research (CR)**\n\nCR is a loose but united, non-profit organization composed of Web3 industry researchers.

Its organization name “Challenger” comes from the wrecked US space shuttle “Challenger”. Although Web3’s world exploration is full of failure possibility, CR is still willing to be a pioneer. CR does not deliberately pursue anonymity, but it still will not disclose the organization members, their work and research. New researchers can join CR publicly or anonymously, and we also accept contributions in various forms. CR will conduct some interesting experiments later. For example, when ERC721QS-3 or QS-X contract is adopted, we will generate CR-SBT to verify the researcher’s identity, and determine the researcher’s proposal and qualification to participate in possible meetings.\n\nTemporary contact: 5660.eth\n\nSearch 5660.eth on Blockscan Chat and start the conversation\n\n[https://chat.blockscan.com/index](https://chat.blockscan.com/index)\n\nKnow about our recent experiment projects and more details to be disclosed:\n\n[https://linktr.ee/10kuniverse](https://linktr.ee/10kuniverse)\n\nAttachment: Soundbound Tokens paper participated by Vitalik: “Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul”\n\nEnglish version: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763>\n\nChinese version: <https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/1652665746121864.html>", "timestamp": 1654664712, "digest": "x3B-VnEmEem0soMVyd1Nueob7jYnaqTxghOs58drzlc", "contributor": "0x648E7865bDfAC56c0233a9999206867725ecE54D"}

{"id": "auMIebO3iSqBCbd61XJEa8-8aeDZHa2YJJy_Wt9zcUI", "title": "Our friendship is the most \"porcelain\"", "body": "We both love porcelain, and we met and became good friends at the Literati Porcelain Symposium. But their identities are very different, one is the boss of a big company, the other is a small cadre of the agency. The boss is rich, and once donated a collection worth one million yuan to the provincial museum, and I can't earn one million in my life. Even if I meet the favorite porcelain, most of them don't have the money to buy it, so I can only feast my eyes and only Buy some cheap stuff. But we are all very knowledgeable. In the words of the Tao, we have never missed each other, so we admire each other and cherish each other.\n\nI often become the guest of the boss. Whenever there are Tibetan friends from other places, the boss welcomes you. If you don’t have me, you can’t have a seat. The minimum consumption of the hotel is 1,000 yuan per person. This is equivalent to half my salary.\n\nI also often invite the boss to dinner. For example, if I sell a piece of china and earn thousands of dollars, I will take the boss to the snack bar, cook a few side dishes, and drink a bottle of beer for two yuan. The boss has never disliked me, always willing to go. After the meal, the boss watched me take out a few crumpled bills to check out, and never rushed to pay the bill. Although the boss often pays for others, once, when I went to the boss to help identify a piece of china, I met a well-known official and bluntly asked the boss to reimburse some hospitality expenses. The boss didn't even take a close look at the amount, so he signed the invoice and asked the treasurer to take it with him to write a check.\n\nThe boss said, these people can't be provoked, alas! In my company, people often use their identities to reimburse meals, oil, and even family members' medical expenses for various reasons.\n\nMy wife once had an operation, and the cost of the medicine has not been reimbursed due to the tightness of the unit's funds. So I didn't speak to the boss, even though the drug bill has affected my life. We are good friends who are close as brothers. How can the boss stand by and watch if I speak? It seems that the boss also knew about this, and even went to the hospital to visit in person, but I didn't mention it at all.\n\nBut the old man always helped me in a unique way. There was a leak in the bathroom of my house. The boss, who was a mason, personally went into battle, planed the floor, made it waterproof, and then installed the new floor with cement. He was sweating profusely. The boss said, even if you pay to hire people, you can't find a mason with my craftsmanship. I smiled happily and handed tea to the boss.\n\nIf I go back to the country to visit my mother, the boss will also buy some gifts, and eight times out of ten, I will drive there in person. The boss said, your mother is my mother. On my mother's birthday, the boss even turned down a business and decided to go. It is true that we are close as brothers, but in many ways, we are irresistible. I have a piece of china to sell, waiting for the money to buy other items. The boss has long liked it, so he might as well pass it to me. The market price of that piece of porcelain is 10,000 yuan, which is a clear price for the two connoisseurs. The boss wanted it, but I only asked for 8,000. The boss smiled.\n\nA mere 2,000 yuan is nothing to the boss. I can give the full price, or even take this opportunity to give me more money, because my life is not rich, but the boss didn't do that. We are two different tracks in our respective lives. The boss runs a company, drives a luxury car, lives in a hotel, and flies around to talk about business. It can be said that I am making money every day. I am conscientious and conscientious in the organization. I have a wish, when I save enough money, I will accompany my wife to go to Yunnan, which I have longed for.\n\nFor the CEO, Yunnan is a place he often goes to. Not to mention myself, those who cling to him have also played in his light, but as his good friend, I work hard as a dream. The boss just wished me to realize this wish as soon as possible. I also wish the CEO success in his career and good fortune.\n\nSuch a pair of friends is rare in the world, one never feels inferior and the other is never snobby. Others say I have integrity, don't look up, don't cling to, and don't drop the price. And I admire that boss even more, he doesn't give alms easily, he just treats me with a normal heart. And according to the secular view, we seem to be like brothers, but we don't seem to be close to human feelings. I even feel that one is pretending to be arrogant, and the other is just hypocritical.\n\nBut those who know about porcelain know that the same piece of porcelain, if it is perfect, can be worth a fortune, but a slight flaw, even if there is a big scar on a fingernail or a shallow crack, will be a big discount. \"Porcelain is not worth a penny if it's broken.\" That's the truth.

{"id": "CTGQG0W8iu7qXY1I_rJsGWPtlKzxo5vKAsN-XdUH6Oc", "title": "Introducing TeaPartyDAO", "body": "We're going to enter an exciting time in TeaParty with what we're going to release. Introducing **TeaPartyDAO**.\n\nIn TeaParty, we want to empower content creators and bring real values to our users. There are three components to be deployed in order to make this a success.\n\n\n---\n\n## Party Space\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i6XSuaY-mWqMnmSDNAoR7.png?height=521&width=1014)\n\nThe first component would be called \"**Party Space**\".\n\nParty Space is crucial for us because this is where we can bring the meaning of culture into our social platform. If you noticed in the current TeaParty design, all posts are mingled around in the same section and causing confusion to users. That's why we're going to improve it by introducing the \"Party Space\", with each space being a container zone to contain all the relevant social posts in one place, which allows a tidy and organized structure for each social post to belong. So moving on, every post is required to associate with party space tagging in order to appear in the guest's feed. Then, as a guest, you will need to join the space that you are passionate about in order to view and interact with the social post for rewards.\n\n### A sneak peeks into the Party Space design:\n\n![Party Space UI design](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-NaLSvU23WtwiyAB77czK.png?height=1487&width=1855)\n\n### Party Space key elements:\n\n1. **Hero banner**: big section container to present the party identity.\n2. **Party Picture**: profile image for the party page.\n3. **Party Details**: informational section with an explanation about the party space. Includes useful info snippets such as the number of followers.\n4. **Social post**: rewarding social post created by TeaParty Host to reward guests for interacting.\n5. **Pinned post**: highlighted post for the party page.\n6. **Post tags**: tagging to determine which space this post belongs.\n\n### Party Space benefits\n\n* **Quality content**\n  * The introduction of space allowed guests to enjoy meaningful and high-quality content\n* **Targeted guests with relevant interests**\n  * The introduction of space allowed guests to focus on topics that they were interested in.\n  * As a host, you could focus the placement of your content on the right audience.\n\n### A total of 58 party spaces are available on this release:\n\n![List of 58 Party Spaces](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ihWhBj0VWvWyU7HPCCuLg.png?height=521&width=1014)\n\n## Rewards Pool\n\n![Rewards Pool — Content Creator Pool, Party Space Growth & Charity Pool](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gEYD7cH-RfTXY9k2RlZ80.png?height=521&width=1014)\n\nThe second component in our DAO would be the rewards pool. Currently, we arranged a 6 months program with 200,000 $TEA allocated for each month, in which we will be focusing on three pools designed:\n\n* **Content Creators pool** (45%) — 90,000 $TEA\n* **Party space growth pool** (45%) — 90,000 $TEA\n* **Charity pool** (10%) — 20,000 $TEA\n\n**To kickstart the party space growth, we have partnered with a few reputable projects.**\n\n*More information about it to be released in the future. If you have your own* *project and would love to join our party space pool to grow your project, please do [look for us](https://discord.gg/xAcSwtNYhR).*\n\n### Countries Party Space\n\nAnother important mention, we will allocate 1200 $TEA from the space rewards pool to be allocated to 9 active countries participating in our Discord, which will be mentioned in alphabetical order, starting with\n\n* China\n* France\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Japan\n* Singapore\n* Ukraine\n* Vietnam\n* Korea\n\nIf you are from any of these countries, you will be able to tap into the fund from our pool to share important news about your country or use the funds to promote any good cause and projects that will bring benefits as a whole.\n\n\n---\n\n## How does the tech work?\n\nSo, there might still be a question in your head regarding how are we going to allocate these funds?\n\nA sneak peeks into the **new feature design of our DAO**:\n\n![TeaPartyDAO UI design](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NUNdz9VcQJXKwvoDN3XEo.png?height=2040&width=1855)\n\nWith the new design, you could submit your proposal on our DAO.\n\nLet's say you have a Tweet from yourself or a Tweet from someone else, which relatable to the space you join and you would like to amplify the post, let's say a post about finance, and you think the post is important to be amplified, you could submit your proposal on the DAO.\n\n**There are two ways to get your proposal to be approved**:\n\n1. The first is via the approval of Super Hosts\n2. The second is via community voting\n\nFor the first approach you will need at least two Super Hosts to review it and if both of them are okay, they could approve the proposal directly, or deny it if it is not appropriate.\n\nThe other way is via community voting. In order to get it approved, your proposal would need at least 500 $TEA to be approved. The opposite is applied, if the community decided to place 500 $TEA to deny your proposal.\n\nSo what happens if the proposal is approved? There is no action needed from your end, as the smart contract will do the work and amplify your post behind the scene.\n\n## Decentralized Social Governance\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ln4Pw97mQc9rUR3bCGIlw.png?height=521&width=1014)\n\nLastly, I would like to introduce to you the third component, which is \"**Decentralized Social Governance**\".\n\nTeaParty is designed to be decentralized in mind, we decided to make certain structures to be governed by the community who are passionate about it. And of course, we want to reward our community with what we could afford, so you will get paid for the action you have, but subject to the budget we have allocated each month, we allocated 1200 $TEA for each party space.\n\n### So how do you contribute?\n\n* **Art curation**, banner — 250 $TEA; space profile image — 100 $TEA\n* **Content curation** (Title,  description) — 10 $TEA\n* **Report a post** (Censorship) — 3 $TEA\n* **Pin a post** — 3 $TEA\n* **Super Host** — 3 $TEA for every action on approval\n\n*All payouts above are subject to the availability of* 1200 *$TEA budget allocated each month*\n\n*Similarly, in order for you to get paid, you would need approval from the Party Space Super Hosts or the community voting to take effect for the payout to be released.*\n\n\n---\n\n## Super Host\n\nLastly, I would like to introduce a new role, which is called \"**Super Host**\".\n\nIt is a managing role in TeaParty to help manage the party space to ensure the social environment is secure and lively and to promote healthy engagement with the community. For every space, there would be three Super Hosts positions available. So if you are interested, you could apply for the position available. It will be a first come first serve basis with priority reserve for the whitelist participants and early guests from our community.\n\nAnd this role would be reviewed every month to ensure the Super Hosts who joined us are credible for their contribution to our party space.\n\n\n---\n\nSo that's it, all these features are expected to be released in the first week of June, so stay tuned guys.\n\nSee y'all soon on TeaPartyDAO!\n\n\n---\n\n### Connect with us\n\n**[Website](https://teaparty.life/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teapartylife) | [Blog](https://mirror.xyz/teapartylife.eth) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/36AKSBMu3w)**", "timestamp": 1654665318, "digest": "YEueQgxsupG1t2VabAyFAUcuJmX1_t-nCoMYvSvkdQ4", "contributor": "0xcd3B95032441457aA6382fD1312753353368bE41"}

Note that as of this writing, four different networks, including “Polygon” and “Arbitrum”, have been added to the hashflow platform, and support for other networks is set to be added to this popular exchange in the near future…\n\n![https://app.hashflow.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QWBHng-ALc6iIWY5FkWe0.png?height=1042&width=1920)\n\nFinally, we come to the finall part where we talk about the completing the order.

{"id": "9ftvjd5Ijpo_w9T-JOli0xyvwe3dLJzcjq9Qn2N9ev4", "title": "Telegram disaster", "body": "[https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1ss24a6](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1ss24a6)\n\n英文原文：\n\ndear crypto,\nI want to come clean, and I will likely tear a rift in the entire community while I'm at it and on my way out.\n\nOver the course of these next few weeks I will be releasing 137.21GB of Telegram group chats and messages, of which I was not a part of. Why? This is all thanks to an exploit in October of 2019 that allowed one to access the group page with recent messages if proper permissions were not set up. At the time of writing this, the team at Telegram have been contacted about this. I've only ever seen two people mention this exploit in passing, one in person and one on Twitter, so I know I was not the only one.\n\nThose who know me will know who I am very soon, for the rest of the populace it doesn't matter. Due to the overwhelming amount of messages, I formally invite reputable press within the community to reach out in order to obtain sample archives from groups I've already curated. I will vet you because there is a conflict of interest as many are involved personally, whether being friends of those individuals in this archive or related financially in one way or another. You will receive the .7zip archive ahead of time but it will be password-protected until the 7th of July.\n\nI have no further relationships with the people mentioned after this and will never be in contact with them in the future as of this moment.\n\nThree years ago, a vulnerability on Telegram was discovered by a colleague of mine. He did not take it to its final outcome. By exploiting this, one could recreate an invite to view the overview page and recent messages of any Telegram group of an individual user without actually joining said group.\n\nBetween October of 2019 to May of 2022 I was collecting all messages as is in my data hoarding nature. I had written a script that downloads every message sent to any Telegram group with targetted individuals, you may know some of them as crypto influencers, while others targetted included many investors in the space. As Telegram adoption among crypto users began to grow, it began to become increasingly difficult to monitor all these group chats so I stepped away for a while and let the messages continue to download and be copied to my personal server.\n\nFor the most popular traders in the community, spying on them became a hobby. From personal events in their lives shared with their closest friend groups, to scams and rugpulls that were created on their way to success, financially and socially on Twitter. I felt like a part of it even though I had no method to interact with them. However, as they got rich, I got rich. I got myself into plenty of VC groups and soon my entire circle of friends and those I talked to became one and the same.\n\nI did not care in the past, some of these people are looked up to in the ecosystem nowadays and the thought of these individuals commiting fraud would be dismissed in an instant. Some even moving on from their days of bygone scams under anonymous names with their groups of friends (while others continue to persist to this day).\n\nArtists pretending to be developers, developers pretending to be artists. Those pretending to be rich, those pretending to be poor, pretending to be someone you're not. All of that was exposed to me. All of that was this community at its core when expressing themselves to the public, usually through Twitter.\n\nI do not know what it is about Telegram, but the alleged assurance of privacy and security meant that people became relaxed and let them express themselves freely.\n\nIt doesn't matter to me anymore. I am dying from illnesses that are wreaking havoc on my body.

I hope you understand.\n\n中文翻译：\n\n我想说清楚，在我做这件事的时候，我可能会在整个社区撕开一道裂缝，在我离开的时候。\n\n在接下来的几周里，我将发布137.21GB的Telegram群组聊天记录和信息，其中我并没有参与其中。为什么？这都要归功于2019年10月的一个漏洞，在没有设置适当的权限的情况下，就可以访问带有最近信息的群组页面。在写这篇文章的时候，Telegram的团队已经就此事进行了联系。我只见过两个人顺便提到过这个漏洞，一个是本人，一个是在Twitter上，所以我知道我不是唯一的一个。\n\n认识我的人很快就会知道我是谁，对于其他民众来说，这并不重要。由于信息量过大，我正式邀请社区内有声望的媒体联系，以便从我已经策划好的团体中获得样本档案。我将对你进行审查，因为有利益冲突，因为许多人都涉及到个人，不管是这个档案中那些人的朋友，还是在某种程度上有经济关系。你将提前收到.7zip档案，但在7月7日之前，它将受到密码保护。\n\n在这之后，我与所提到的人没有进一步的关系，从这一刻起，今后也不会再与他们接触。\n\n三年前，Telegram上的一个漏洞被我的一个同事发现。他并没有把它带到最后的结果。通过利用这个漏洞，人们可以重新创建一个邀请，以查看个人用户的任何Telegram组的概述页面和最近的消息，而无需实际加入所述组。\n\n在2019年10月至2022年5月期间，我正在收集所有的消息，因为这是我囤大数据的本性。我写了一个脚本，下载发送到任何Telegram群组的目标个人的每一条信息，你可能知道其中一些是加密货币影响者，而其他目标包括该领域的许多投资者。随着Telegram在加密货币用户中的应用开始增长，监控所有这些群组聊天开始变得越来越困难，所以我离开了一段时间，让信息继续下载并复制到我的个人服务器。\n\n**对于社区中最受欢迎的交易者，监视他们成为一种爱好。从他们生活中的个人事件与他们最亲密的朋友群体分享，到他们在Twitter上成功的道路上创造的骗局和毯子，经济上和社会上。我觉得自己是其中的一员，尽管我没有办法与他们互动。然而，随着他们发财，我也发财了。我让自己进入了大量的风险投资团体，很快我的整个朋友圈和我交谈的人都变成了同一个人。**\n\n**过去我并不在意，如今这些人中的一些人在生态系统中被人仰视，一想到这些人犯了欺诈罪，就会立刻被驳回。有些人甚至从过去以匿名的名义与他们的朋友群体一起诈骗的日子里继续前进（而其他人则继续坚持到今天）。**\n\n**艺术家假扮成开发商，开发商假扮成艺术家。那些假装富有的人，那些假装贫穷的人，假装成你不是的人。所有这些都暴露在我面前。**所有这些都是这个社区在向公众表达自己时的核心，通常是通过Twitter。\n\n我不知道Telegram是什么，但所谓的隐私和安全的保证意味着人们变得轻松，让他们自由地表达自己。\n\n这对我来说已经无所谓了。**我正被疾病折磨得奄奄一息，对我的身体造成了巨大的破坏。**我赚的任何钱都只会转给我的家人，之后我就会消失。\n\n**但在这种内疚感从我身上释放出来之前，我所提到的许多个人或项目将无法生存下去，要么是由于公众的反感，财务欺诈，要么是其他不起眼的原因，如尴尬。有些人可能会从他们的权力位置上退下来，其他人很可能会忽视它，因为他们不能声称被存档的信息是欺诈性的，除非参与群聊的每个人都在同一页上。**\n\n**会有混乱，会有悲伤，会有愤怒，会有挫折。我很想知道接下来会发生什么，但我让其他人决定如何继续前进。**\n\n6月15日将发布来自的摘录。\n\n* 有影响力的加密货币持有者，从少至800名追随者到多至100万名追随者不等。\n* 与种族主义和同性恋有关的讨论，与公众和加密货币社区内的人的通奸和性侵犯有关的讨论\n* 那些拥有8-9位数字和大量推特追随者的人，在2019年12月至2022年2月期间讨论拉锯战项目，即旨在诈骗社区和个人的项目\n* 与一群朋友一起杀害和窃取个人的加密货币（通过电报协调）。\n\n6月30日。\n\n* 前200个MCap项目中的项目创建者，从收益耕作项目到稳定币，再到AMM，所有这些项目从一开始就是为了从大多数用户那里抽走资金。\n* 讨论包括来自加密货币影响者的所有内容\n* 邀请参加私人飞机上的狂欢，在豪宅中，在VR环境中，到处都是狂欢。\n* 性侵犯、强奸和恋童癖，包括与年仅8岁的受害者的恋童癖狂欢\n* 暗杀，不是一次，不是两次，而是三次（通过电报协调）。\n* 大量的通奸和对前女友的怪异迷恋，向她们赠送数百万美元，希望让她们重新爱上你（你知道你是谁，随它去吧）。\n* 要求Twitter员工亲自删除和/或禁止与犯罪信息有关的账户\n\n7月7日。\n一切都将被公布。\n\n文件名：e135846e2594f4ddb45abee1e27c8521329e440b9af77891a29ae54f8cd71bbc - 137.21GB.7zip，标题为\"CTGHistory\"\n\n6月15日、30日和7月7日将提供密码，所有信息将通过签名交易获得，地址如下。0xdC56BCccf3fa51687f339E2425E9Bc1a2acB42Ee\n\n我不需要PGP来验证。推特很可能会把这个消息拿下来，在一天结束的时候，我做了我能做的事情，以消除授予那些不值得的人的权力和成功。\n\n对我生命中的人，我很抱歉，但这是我的决定。我希望你能理解。", "timestamp": 1654666455, "digest": "lWIXTaiGWVroe2l42AR1EhRs-f_NvxYhOWjxbKqV9kE", "contributor": "0x8844A26344C97134B0D5bd8B8493C5Ab10799843"}

{"id": "c9GJktXFxLJupJ6CGQ-tGkbpQn_hgX4WMpNweKgNj5Q", "title": "人品不过关，谈什么都没用", "body": "做事先做人，这是亘古不变的道理。如何做人，不仅体现了一个人的智慧，也体现了一个人的修养。一个人不管多聪明，多能干，背景条件有多好，如果不懂得做人，人品很差，那么，他的事业将会大受影响。只有先做人，才能做大事，这是古训，先人早就强调了“做人为先”的重要性。 \n  \n 我们的先人孔子，其思想可以说是中国千年文化底蕴的沉淀，他告诉我们“子欲为事，先为人圣”“得才兼备，以德为首”“德若水之源，才若水之波”。因此的可见，中华民族历史来讲究做人的道理。 \n  \n 我们从小到大，有关做人的道理耳熟能详。然而，品性优劣却人各有异，做事的结果也大相径庭。任何失败者都不是偶然的，同样，任何成功者的成功都是其必然性，其中最重要的一个因素就在于怎样做人。 \n  \n 人品，是一个人施展能力的基础，是当今社会稀缺而珍贵的品质标签。人品和能力，如同左手和右手：单有能力，没有人品，人将残缺不全。能力是一把双刃剑：如果掌握在品德高尚的人手中，它将会给团队与社会创造出无数的价值；相反，如果掌握在品德低下的人手中，它将时刻有可能会成为组织与社会前进的羁绊。 \n  \n 有许多人才济济的单位，也面临着动力不足、内耗严重乃至惨遭淘汰的结局。究其原因，员工人品起着决定性的作用。缺乏忠诚、敬业、服从、合作的團队，往往更容易迷失在勾心斗角、尔虞我诈、损公肥私的争斗中。众多的单位领导都认定：能力合格的人不一定是上品，而人品不合格的人就是危险品。 \n  \n 没有人会愿意重用一个成绩合格但人品有问题的危险人物。一个人品不好，即使有天大的才能，他也可能会在关键的时候给组织带来伤害，并且，能力越大造成的损失也会越大。从这个意义上说，“人品”其实决定着整个组织与个人成长的金钥匙。 \n  \n 古人云：厚德载物，就是说，人要有好德行，就没有承载不了的事。相反，人无大德便无法成就大事。吃亏是福，我们要乐于吃亏，多为别人着想，才能成就一方事业。同时，厚德是福，做人厚道，方能得到别人的尊重爱戴，善良是好人品的关键因素。人要常怀一颗感恩的心，不要斤斤计较，要多存爱心，多兴善举，多站在别人的角度想问题，才能拥有良好的人缘和信誉。一个人的信用度也是很关键的，如果没有信用，什么事也干不好。人与人之间的交往，关键是要讲信用。古人把守信看作是做人非常重要的品行之一，讲究言必行，行必果。 \n  \n 常言道：“海纳百川，有容乃大”。人要有一颗宽容之心，方能容天下难容之事。我们要学会宽容与自己看法不同的人，特别是与自己有矛盾的人。宽容别人实际上是给自己的心灵松绑，否则，只会给自己的心灵加压，受累的还是自己。要承认人与人之间的差别，多看别人的优点和长处，宽容别人不足之处，一分为二地看待别人，学会用欣赏的眼光看人。 \n  \n 欣赏别人是一种境界，善待别人是一种胸怀，关心别人是一种品质，理解别人是一种涵养，帮助别人是一种快乐。应当学会倾听，学会微笑，学会赞扬。多留财富，少留包袱。多留风范，少留遗憾。多留经验，少留缺陷。 \n  \n 做人要以诚为本，因为诚实是立身之本，诚实是做人的一种美德。人之无诚，不可为交。“欲当大任，须是笃实”。做人只有实实在在，老老实实，才能赢得别人的尊重，才能在社会上站稳脚跟。", "timestamp": 1654666132, "digest": "ogJ9i4EkVLMjU2i4mFTB6m6ta59tcJfTrVk88LoTwrw", "contributor": "0x27BCf6FD48676bf1DbCc57679C88694aB77adAaa"}

{"id": "OElUng7UengmsBq5EbtvrOr4XmAwvpJ8cPualQF0Wxs", "title": "人品不过关，谈什么都没用", "body": "做事先做人，这是亘古不变的道理。如何做人，不仅体现了一个人的智慧，也体现了一个人的修养。一个人不管多聪明，多能干，背景条件有多好，如果不懂得做人，人品很差，那么，他的事业将会大受影响。只有先做人，才能做大事，这是古训，先人早就强调了“做人为先”的重要性。 \n  \n 我们的先人孔子，其思想可以说是中国千年文化底蕴的沉淀，他告诉我们“子欲为事，先为人圣”“得才兼备，以德为首”“德若水之源，才若水之波”。因此的可见，中华民族历史来讲究做人的道理。 \n  \n 我们从小到大，有关做人的道理耳熟能详。然而，品性优劣却人各有异，做事的结果也大相径庭。任何失败者都不是偶然的，同样，任何成功者的成功都是其必然性，其中最重要的一个因素就在于怎样做人。 \n  \n 人品，是一个人施展能力的基础，是当今社会稀缺而珍贵的品质标签。人品和能力，如同左手和右手：单有能力，没有人品，人将残缺不全。能力是一把双刃剑：如果掌握在品德高尚的人手中，它将会给团队与社会创造出无数的价值；相反，如果掌握在品德低下的人手中，它将时刻有可能会成为组织与社会前进的羁绊。 \n  \n 有许多人才济济的单位，也面临着动力不足、内耗严重乃至惨遭淘汰的结局。究其原因，员工人品起着决定性的作用。缺乏忠诚、敬业、服从、合作的團队，往往更容易迷失在勾心斗角、尔虞我诈、损公肥私的争斗中。众多的单位领导都认定：能力合格的人不一定是上品，而人品不合格的人就是危险品。 \n  \n 没有人会愿意重用一个成绩合格但人品有问题的危险人物。一个人品不好，即使有天大的才能，他也可能会在关键的时候给组织带来伤害，并且，能力越大造成的损失也会越大。从这个意义上说，“人品”其实决定着整个组织与个人成长的金钥匙。 \n  \n 古人云：厚德载物，就是说，人要有好德行，就没有承载不了的事。相反，人无大德便无法成就大事。吃亏是福，我们要乐于吃亏，多为别人着想，才能成就一方事业。同时，厚德是福，做人厚道，方能得到别人的尊重爱戴，善良是好人品的关键因素。人要常怀一颗感恩的心，不要斤斤计较，要多存爱心，多兴善举，多站在别人的角度想问题，才能拥有良好的人缘和信誉。一个人的信用度也是很关键的，如果没有信用，什么事也干不好。人与人之间的交往，关键是要讲信用。古人把守信看作是做人非常重要的品行之一，讲究言必行，行必果。 \n  \n 常言道：“海纳百川，有容乃大”。人要有一颗宽容之心，方能容天下难容之事。我们要学会宽容与自己看法不同的人，特别是与自己有矛盾的人。宽容别人实际上是给自己的心灵松绑，否则，只会给自己的心灵加压，受累的还是自己。要承认人与人之间的差别，多看别人的优点和长处，宽容别人不足之处，一分为二地看待别人，学会用欣赏的眼光看人。 \n  \n 欣赏别人是一种境界，善待别人是一种胸怀，关心别人是一种品质，理解别人是一种涵养，帮助别人是一种快乐。应当学会倾听，学会微笑，学会赞扬。多留财富，少留包袱。多留风范，少留遗憾。多留经验，少留缺陷。 \n  \n 做人要以诚为本，因为诚实是立身之本，诚实是做人的一种美德。人之无诚，不可为交。“欲当大任，须是笃实”。做人只有实实在在，老老实实，才能赢得别人的尊重，才能在社会上站稳脚跟。", "timestamp": 1654666153, "digest": "ogJ9i4EkVLMjU2i4mFTB6m6ta59tcJfTrVk88LoTwrw", "contributor": "0x27BCf6FD48676bf1DbCc57679C88694aB77adAaa"}

{"id": "yqN1wT68-r8e_ZO-ggtoI_kn8IyhwRMGPiXVTWDMAT4", "title": "CosmWasm on Osmosis, Cosmoverse的跨链智能合约引擎", "body": "## 总览\n\nCosmWasm  是兼具Cosmos SDK和IBC的一个智能合约引擎，它是目前除了EVM之外唯一具有跨平台互操作性的平台，如果说EVM是一台Mainfraime大型机器，那么CosmWasm VM可以理解为通过IBC协议连接的可以相互通信的机群。和Tendermint, SDK, IBC等类似CosmWasm是Cosmos 技术堆栈中的核心组件，任何基于Cosmos SDK开发的链都可以在不改变其代码逻辑的情况下接入CosmWasm。目前支持Rust语言，Goland和vlang语言正在开发。CosmWasm可以理解为开发者无需开发自主链的情况下，搭建安全和可组合性的跨链应用的跨链框架，相比于Cosmos SDK， 迭代速度更快，更为安全。目前我们看到接入CosmWasm的项目在过去六个月内逐步增长，目前总共接入项目的价值在40-50亿美金。Terra曾一度是CosmWasm最大的受益者，Cosmos生态排名第一的TVL，但其最近的毁灭性事件，让越来越多的Terra开发者开始选择加入CosmWasm，和Cosmos 其他项目，为生态带来了一定存量价值。\n\n既然上文提到CosmWam是Cosmos中重要的核心模块，那么什么是模块？模块可以包含特定应用的商业逻辑，每个模块针对于他们特定的应用都是独特的，每个应用也都有自己的商业逻辑。对于不同的模块，比如CosmWasm，比如治理模块等，针对不同的应用，那么这些模块如何组合呢？主要通过原生的Cosmos SDK连接，任何应用都可以在其上搭建自己的应用链，而且也可以自主选择这些模块。同时，这些模块对于所有Cosmos的项目都可用的，任何Cosmos SDK链都可以选择接入CosmWasm进一步提高链的特性。所以在Cosmos 生态中，每条链都可以选择适合自己的模块，并且通过增加新的模块，不停迭代开发，相比于单片链的设计，这种模块化设计简化了堆栈的设计，开发者可以从不同模块中选择可组合性。\n\n## Cosmwasm的特性\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d-r2m98dOppU_4U-L2N5V.png?height=989&width=1080)\n\n这里的核心特征强调了CosmWasm进一步加强了IBC的作用，在CosmWasm下，IBC迭代速度更快，更为灵活且动态。上文提到，所有生态新的功能都以Cosmos SDK模块化的形式呈现给开发者的，而大部分这些模块都是由Cosmos SDK贡献者或者其他Cosmos核心贡献者创建和维护的。所以目前Interchain GmbH 的团队负责审核，测试，集成这些所有模块，并于之后负责Gaia代码库的更新发布以及与节点沟通相应的网络更新。而软件发布和更新需要上线和运行公共测试网，需要使用来自Cosmos Hub的验证器集和模仿实时Cosmos Hub的链状态来模拟升级提案。最后，Cosmos Hub的验证者还需要为升级做准备，并且在合适的高度更新节点或者配置Cosmovisor，实现自动升级。为了让升级 Cosmos SDK 模块更容易，Stargate 做了很多工作，但仍然很困难，当Zone接入越来越多的链时，这个沟通成本将越来越高，因而给IBC的扩展带来了很大的瓶颈。而 CosmWasm 内置了一个许可的、每个合约的迁移功能。这可以逐个逐个地将合约迁移到新的代码库，并在此过程中运行迁移功能，进行任何所需的数据转换。完全无需链间的协调和沟通。\n\n因此，如果是EVM是传统VM, Solana 中的虚拟机是为了实现垂直扩展，那么CosmWasm的出现解决了跨链水平可扩展性的问题，因此其在跨链虚拟机中占据了非常重要的位置，并且进一步强化了IBC的功能，特别是在稍后跨链账户，跨链安全这两个功能上线后，我们可以看到会有越来越多的项目接入CosmWasm。\n\n## vs EVM，Cosmos SDK？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bI8uFxQL7kn78dSeYXjbQ.png?height=442&width=905)\n\n和其他虚拟机相比，CosmWasm 有什么特性呢？首先是安全，CosmWasm 认为以太坊的安全合约问题是由于其内部的设计，而其设计可以解决大部分Solidity中的攻击，比如重入攻击等，同时他们提供了很好的合约迁移的开发者体验，而非”图书馆合约“； 同时以太坊的合约存在很多的商业逻辑问题，例如Compound 就因为利用If条件中的 < 而非 <= 损失了9000万美金，而CosmWasm 可以通过各种测试，包括单元测试，集成测试以及全栈测试，可以减少这类型风险的产生；性能和成本问题，以太坊的高燃料费用主要是用于其区块/燃料的限制，只能交易30笔/秒, 而CosmWasm 则更类似于ETH2.0愿景；当然还包括可迁移性和可组合性，比如在你使用CosmWasm一段时间后，你需要去开发自己的应用链，那么你可以上线新的CosmWasm Zone, 并且在新的多链上进行迭代，用户可以保持与原先链关联的状态下，可以选择到新链上。\n\n而相较于Cosmos SDK, 有什么特性呢? 对于一些在共识机制上的创新项目（例如取代dPOS),或者费用机制，集成GPU计算引擎，这类型的项目的确需要Cosmos SDK（Go 语言），但是大部分的项目，通过Cosmwasm就可以实现。在跨链安全即将上线之后，我们将看到越来越多的项目将以合约消费链的形式通过CosmWasm，享有Cosmos Hub的全部安全性，接入到IBC和Cosmos生态，而合约消费链无需运营自己的验证节点集合，因为Cosmos Hub的节点将会帮助验证。当然之后你可以随时迁移到其他链，或者发布自己的应用链；可组合型也是一方面，我们上文提到，Cosmos SDK是模块的核心，但是模块间是如何实现集成的呢？如果一个项目3，4个模块间可以通讯，那么多条链，多个模块如何实现交互呢？这个就需要跨链账户和CosmWasm的介入。当然还有上文提到的软件更新迭代等问题，这里就不详细阐明了。\n\n我们的确看到了CosmWasm的很多优势，但是仍然有很多不确定性\n\n1） EVM 目前占据了大量的市场份额，包括以太坊和其他EVM 链，Cosmos中的Evmos中的EVM，以及Agoric中的Javascript,等其他虚拟机，所以如何搭建自己的生态和开发者社区，制定战略方向和相应营销策略和战略方向显得尤为重要；\n\n2）目前没有经过大量的实战考验，并且需要进行相应技术更新，比如目前节点仅支持Intel 和AMD64芯片，而对于ARM64(新苹果电脑M1）这种开发者常用的电脑，目前仅建议只读，并未经过大规模认证，并不适合参与节点认证出块，所以像Osmosis这样选择接入的应用链的节点，需要更新CPU；\n\n3）门槛较高，Rust语言相比EVM的Solidity有几大特性：内存安全，业务逻辑以外的系统bug比较少，保证内存安全，编译阶段都能识别内存不安全的错误；高并发性，编译Assembly与硬件直接交互，性能比较高；但开发门槛较高，审计代码门槛也高，学习曲线和难度相较于Solidity都非常高；\n\n4）目前Cosmwasm的开发文档还比较少，需要完善；另外相关的工具也不完善，需要开发更好的工具；\n\n所以CosmWasm 将着重于以下三方面的发展，其中包括1）更好的开发者onboarding 体验，CosmWasm Academy 致力于帮助培训CosmWasm的开发者；2）更好的开发工具，其中包括“ng-合约”开发框架简化Rust开发，提供更好的可组合性；CosmWasmJS (前端语言），类似于Solidity Web3. JS 降低开发者门槛；部署合约的演示脚本；在JS中容易测试合约；自动转换Type Script API 的工具；本地虚拟机测试；开发第三方CosmWasm IDE（接口），类似于Solidity的Remix；开发合约认证服务，减小审计难度等；3) 跨链合约开发，这里包括将IBC开发引入到更多的应用开发者生态，为Osmosis/Juno 创建IBC 兑换协议；IBC合约开发文档化; 提升TypeScript中集成测试的ts-中继器；和Interchain GmbH合作人才培训等。\n\n## Proposal 69解读\n\n之前Cosmos 社区针对是否将CosmWasm添加至Cosmos Hub的问题，提交了相应提案，社区产生了非常大的分歧。虽然提案最终是被拒了，但我们可以一起再回顾一下这之间产生的核心观点。对于提案的支持者认为，其大大降低向Cosmos Hub提交代码和功能的门槛，目前很多的功能需要通过SDK 模块的形式提交，而这些不同模块是给到不同Cosmos核心贡献者维护的。而一旦这些模块，或者共识，或者其他发生变化/更新/上线，Cosmos Hub团队需要和核心验证节点沟通，Cosmos Hub 的所有验证者都需要为升级做准备，并采取措施在合适的高度更新他们的节点或配置 Cosmovisor 以自动运行升级过程，这需要大量的沟通成本，时间成本。而当Cosmwasm通过治理的方式接入的时候，可以确保任何人可以通过智能合约接入Cosmos Hub的同时，也不会出现恶意代码的攻击，同时也减少了Cosmos Hub与其他团队之间冗余的沟通 ，除了投票所需的时间；同时，可以看到越来越多关于DAPP的设计和应用，包括CW20, CW721, DAODAO 等， 一些简单的功能（比如分润, 交易等），可以通过Cosmos SDK Golang的模块添加，而无需进行全部升级，这个让Hub可添加的功能类型更加多元化。 \n\n当然缺点也存在，包括Cosmwasm兼容性的高维护成本，为了和最新Cosmos v0.46版本兼容，Cosmwasm的版本也需要迭代，而这个版本也同意由Lido和P2P（Cosmos的节点和核心贡献者）更新和维护，而长期来讲，Cosmwasm是由Confio（Interchain Foundation 资助的）维护的 ，而我们也看到Cosmwasm并不能在Windows 运行，在ARM上也是实验性支持，而Cosmos Gaia Binary主要的下载是通过AMD的 linux和Darwin。但是具体的影响还需要和节点相关者确认。\n\n但为什么以Jae， Peng为代表的Cosmos创始团队开始反对这个提案，甚至开始贿赂（取消相关空投）社区呢? 他是真正的Hub Minimalist, 他希望Cosmos Hub能够只专注负责生产区块，而其他的事务都外包给其他链，例如Juno, Osmosis等。而Peng也公开表示，他们比较保守，希望通过安全，稳定的Hub来吸引用户，同时确保其他链的安全。\n\n而部署Cosmwasm的行为他们认为会与Cosmos Hub 的初衷相违背，Jae 表现出非常痛恨这个提议，并且准备将Interchain foundation 剔除其新项目Gnoland的空投，而Interchain Foundation的主席正是他的合伙人Ethan Buchman。当然支持者还包括Cosmos核心开发者 Jack Zampolin 和Zaki Manian等。\n\n截至目前，除了Lido以外，并没有明确的应用将部署在Cosmos Hub上的Cosmwasm.这让反对者更加坚信这是资本和政治的利益间的博弈。Lido感觉更像是像利用了Cosmos的潜在流动性（就像利用ETH 一样，目前占据了以太坊2.0 Staking 28%的市场份额，市值也高达ETH的3%），通过CosmWasm， Lido无需在Cosmos上搭建自己的Layer1, 而可以轻松部署，安全，互操作性协议，所以Lido 以及背后的资本Paradigm 支持Cosmwasm的接入，主要从资本市场利益和ATOM未来的价值捕获方面考虑。而其竞争对手QuickSilver虽然也是做Liquid Staking领域的解决方案，但是采取了不同的方法，选择在Cosmos SDK上搭建自己特定应用链，前期会先通过定制化消费链的形式接入Quicksilver 认为，Staking 衍生品的成功之路是允许用户在用衍生品时选择自己的验证人，并允许用户继续用质押衍生品进行投票。Lido 采取的方法则认为用户不想知道这些细节，委托给这些协议，而他们只想要衍生品。所以它们是两种不同的产品，具有不同的附加值。 \n\n而很多项目如果希望实现流动性质押（Osmosis 认为Interfluid 质押会颠覆流动性质押）， 或者跨链账户等功能，可以通过外部接入Cosmwasm 的形式（Proposal107)，例如Osmosis 就决定外部接入Cosmwasm，而未必需要通过Cosmos Hub。这允许在其之上构建 DeFi 创新。将 CosmWasm 添加到 Osmosis 并将其与现有的原生模块（AMM 和超级流动性质押 Superfluid 质押）结合，可以显著提高，扩展 Osmosis 上可用的功能。但是计划是添加“许可的” CosmWasm，必须进行治理投票以启用将任何新代码部署到链上。当然Cosmwasm允许快速添加许多实用程序和DeFi 协议的功能和可能更快的开发等功能。当然像Juno， Archway， Stargaze等头部项目也都在使用，足见其优势。\n\n## CosmWasm on Osmosis\n\n将 CosmWasm 添加到 Osmosis 并将其与现有的原生模块相结合，会大大提高其核心功能的价值，当然和Juno Network无需许可的添加方式不同，Osmosis上的Cosmwasm是许可的，任何部署到链上的新合约都需要通过治理投票通过后才能启用，并且相比于Osmosis Go binary，其可以实现的并行开发要多的多。同时在实现并行开发的同时，CosmWasm合约也相对安全，你可以将他们理解为相互作用的沙盒（减少了影响其他模块的安全问题），同时带有严格的接口，不会受其他组件（比如AMM更新，Cosmos SDK新版本）等的影响。这使得Osmosis可以和多个开发团队合作，在不影响现有功能的情况下拓展相关应用。开发团队的扩展也带来了更高的效率，尤其是在这个快速变化的行业。\n\n同时，作为模块，其opt in的特性使得任何链都可以去分叉已有代码，并且实行自己的Cosmwasm版本，目前市面上已经有的合约包括CW-Plus Repo, DAO DAO,等,Osmosis可以直接复制并且使用。这将允许快速添加许多功能，并且加快Defi协议的开发，不仅仅通过并行（多个团队同时完成）水平扩展的形式，同时利用现有代码，提升可组合性。 \n\n举个Defi领域的例子，由于最近Terra生态的崩塌，很多的开发者逐步转向Cosmwasm社区和其他Cosmos项目，Mars协议，一度成为Terra中仅次于Anchor 协议的第二大借贷协议,其业务包括借贷和杠杆挖矿，近期重启了其项目，并选择在Cosmos上搭建自己的主权链，而其选择与Osmosis深度合作，其中包括上线IBC相关资产的借贷功能，包括Cosmos (ATOM),  Osmosis (OSMO), Axelar(USDC), 这意味在Osmosis的用户之后可以享有杠杆挖矿，借贷等有趣的Defi服务，而Mars的代币也可以实现治理，分润，质押等功能。Osmosis上的Mars智能合约会收取协议费用并且在Osmosis上兑换为MARS，一旦超过预先指定的阈值，智能合约将触发另一个功能，将 MARS 代币发送到 Mars Hub 上的分发模块。这个我们在之前的文章中提到过，链与链的中继传输通过跨链账户功能实现，而交易的执行完全取决于接收方（这里为Mars的分发模块）的逻辑，而CosmWasm加强了IBC和跨链账户的功能，解决了以往过程中冗余繁琐的手动链间升级。\n\n这里不得不提的还有Osmosis的interfluid staking 功能，为流动性提供者提供收益的同时，也能共享Osmosis网络安全性，参与节点的质押和网络的安全维护。质押给节点的锁定流动性LP代币可以在获得流动性激励和兑换费用的同时，LP交易对中的OSMO可以获得包括通胀，交易费用等相关的质押收益。但是因为只有基于打折系数的OSMO会获得相应收益，所以我们认为这是一种部分安全保证的方式。Superfluid 质押限于OSMO和其他币种的流动性交易对(比如ATOM-OSMO)，而Interfulid 质押（目前还没有上线，预计一年之内)对于现有的Superfluid 质押是种补充，允许其他链上的用户也可以以同样的方式使用锁定的LP仓位，(比如ATOM-JUNO)从而在享有流动性激励的同时维护网络安全，并且获得相应收益。Osmosis认为这是一种优于市面上各种流动性质押协议的解决方案。而CosmWasm将加速、扩展现有的应用功能和场景。\n\n当然在治理方面，Cosmwasm/cw-plus repo也实现了一些创新的投票合约，并将权利反哺给社区。还有一些代币质押的投票合约。比如DAODAO，允许用户在无需代码的情况下，快速启动DAO，尽管和其他DAO工具有些功能类似，但是它可以实现跨链功能，比如可以通过Juno上的账户进行Osmosis上的投票，这都离不开即将上线的跨链账户功能和CosmWasm技术。当然和Osmosis不一样的是，Juno 是基于Cosmwasm开发的真正的无许可的智能合约平台，所以其上的应用质量参差不齐。如果说Osmosis的目标是以AMM业务为核心，搭建许可，开发的Defi帝国，其上搭建的新的CosmWasm应用需要治理通过，并且主要服务于其核心产品（比如机枪池，借贷协议等），并且保持其上应用数量精简，避免出现类似于其他Layer1的网络拥堵等问题，那么Juno和主权应用链相比，则服务于完全不同的市场，任何不符合特定应用链的长尾项目都可以在Juno上搭建，接入IBC和Cosmos。\n\n在IBC 扩展方面，Confio 团队投入了大量工作来使 IBC 意识到智能合约会成为现实。这使得Osmosis可以在两条CosmWasm链间轻松快速部署新的协议。例如ETF链可以在Osmosis上持有代币并进行兑换，或者Osmosis DAO 将代币质押在另一条链上并且获得相应收益，这也大大得益于跨链账户和CosmWasm。\n\n## 代币标准和互操作性\n\nCosmos链通过IBC 通道发送各种信息数据包，实现跨链互通，提供类似于代币发送等功能。这类似于以太坊的ERC20代币标准， CosmWasm也有自己的代币标准：CW20和CW721标准。\n\n这里要注意，CW20代币和Cosmos SDK代币标准不一样，是完全不一样的代币。而我们看到Terra之前大部分的代币都为CW20标准（CosmWasm先行者和成功案例），而Juno 也将使用该标准。同时，Osmosis，JunoSwap等逐步开放了对该标准代币的交易对（Osmosis 上线NETA, CW-20标准）代表了CW-20资产可以和其他链安全地进行交互，比如通过IBC和Osmosis进行交互，而在Cosmos生态中，原来支持的代币转账和交易仅仅支持Cosmos SDK代币。这对于Juno以及更多将使用CosmWasm技术开发的链/应用，包括相应代币提供了更好的兼容性和扩展性。比如你可以通过IBC将Juno代币转移其他Cosmos Zone并且使用它。\n\n当然，目前大部分的中继节点（负责传输交易和信息）只支持Cosmos 原生资产，而CW20资产交易转账的数据传输包和原生资产的不一样，所以CW20资产发送的通道和原有Cosmos SDK的通道也不一样。因此，在无需改变节点和中继服务软件的同时，他们需要更新相应软件发送资产，因而需要更新配置，允许这些支持CW20资产的新通道。Juno目前已经支持了31条活跃通道。\n\n*总结*\n\n至此，我们了解了CosmWasm在多链互通的时代，其跨链虚拟机的重要性，我们也一直在强调，除了Web3.0的愿景，Cosmos也希望重塑现有金融体系，利用Cosmos技术服务于现有的实体经济，服务于中小企业，我们坚信CosmWasm会加速这一目标的实现。Regen Network从2017年开始，致力于塑造绿色经济，其创新地将碳代币化；Tgrade Finance通过Proof of Engement来支持ESG（环境社会治理）的目标;IXO是Regen Network典型的碳中和可再生经济的案例; WYND把DeFi的收入资助给环保基金并管理基金等，我们也希望看到越来越多的开放治理和可再生金融的案例在Cosmos上绽放。", "timestamp": 1654666320, "digest": "et5o5TcuOlobAMsQEfskzmCsxK58vZP48w_UCpn502s", "contributor": "0xf1E26c020a084E77A4931fEE4c997a2b064566fc"}
