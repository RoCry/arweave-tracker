{"id": "xrBrnDGY3pgpnrgev2etQxkjrhCaiVHEhhDqUlok3xk", "title": "Build In Public University - An Experiment in Education", "body": "What does the ideal educational path look like? Pushing yourself through high school, attending a prestigious university, finishing top of your class, getting a high-paying job? Is that the guaranteed path to success?\n\nOk, let’s ask a different question: what does success look like?\n\nI can give you my answer, but I guarantee that that’s different from yours. Hell, it’s a lot different from my answer 6 months, 1 year, 5 years ago. I’ve been digging into it as I’ve gone about my journey. \n\nI wasn’t terribly ambitious in my youth. I went to a state university after getting decent grades in high school. I knew I wanted to be a programmer and I needed a Computer Science degree. That piece of paper was the proof I needed, so I went after it. \n\nI ran into a lot of trouble along the way. Undiagnosed ADHD played a huge roll in that. 7 years later though, I got that degree and then went on to start my career.\n\n10 years into my career, having taken the safe path the whole time, a global pandemic hit and I started re-evaluating my life. I discovered the ADHD and a side of Autism. A few months later, I quit my job and decided I needed something different. I had an idea and I realized that if I wanted to get where I wanted to be, things needed to change.\n\nIn true ADHD fashion, I made the change happen right that minute. Left my job with no notice and decided to figure it out along the way. I saw a world full of opportunities that I had missed and I tried to grab them all at once.\n\nIt didn’t go well. But I had lived the life that everyone told me I needed to live and for the first time in a long time, I was figuring out the life I wanted to live. Had no clue what the hell that looked like, but I was determined to figure it out. \n\nI was going to be an entrepreneur.\n\nSo I read everything I could find. I researched and experimented and tried. I did all sorts of shit. \n\nAnd I realized that most of it didn’t matter. The more I tried, the more I failed. The more I thought I understood, the more I realized how little I knew. The harder I pushed, the slower I moved.\n\nI’ve talked a lot about my first startup, so I’m not going to go into details here. But I’ll say this: my mental health was rocked. I didn’t have the support system I needed, I didn’t have the help I needed, and the resources I found didn’t fit my situation or my needs.\n\nSo I knew I wanted to help others avoid that. I ended up in a dark place before I shut things down to re-evaluate. I had to. I attached my entire self-worth to that startup, so shutting it down was painful.\n\nOne thing that I learned about myself: I was interested in teaching. I wanted to help others by sharing what I’ve learned along the way. I had a revelation: the longer removed from success given entrepreneurs were, the less useful their advice was. So instead of learning from the people who had done it before, I wanted to learn from those who were doing it. I fell into the Build In Public movement headfirst, because I was able to see things from the perspectives of the trenches.\n\nI’ve been working on courses for the past year. I launched my first course almost a year ago, after finishing up the On Deck Course Creator fellowship. I called it Supercharge Your Time and focused on teaching automation principles. As a software engineer, I wanted to help people see how systems worked and how they could build systems that would let them focus their time on what only they could do. It was a good experience, but then I ended up taking on a full-time job with a startup and didn’t run another cohort. But I also wasn’t completely satisfied with the course. There was more to it than that. Automation is one great way to save time, but there were other courses on automation that were more actionable. I dug into details and theories that students didn’t quite need. But the time I felt the best: when I was helping the students work through their specific problems. \n\nIt’s really tough to take a decade of experience in system design and distill it down for people in an actionable manner. But on a 1-1 basis, I can help people design systems that they can understand, because I can use the language that they use. It’s harder to create a general framework for people. \n\nSo I’ve been taking all of that experience, and working on general systems that people can use. I’ve created a ton of content, had multiple attempts and ideas at courses that fizzled out when I tried to get them going, and continued to distill things down as much as possible.\n\nThen I hit on a few things, all around the same time. I realized that content is currently converging - it’s all turning into a homogeneous blob that the algorithm likes. People see what the algorithms like and their content converges on that point. Platforms see this happening and tweak the algorithm. And the cycle continues. \n\nThat’s what happens when we all try to figure things out on our own. We all hit similar answers on what’s successful in the moment. And when you are trying to focus on short-term outcomes, that’s inevitable. And early on as an entrepreneur, it’s necessary to figure things out as quickly as possible, in order to get to a place of minimal stability. \n\nOne way to hit that stability: raise money. That’s what I thought the answer was at first. If I wanted to launch a startup, I needed to raise money, right? But I wanted to raise money in order to hire people who knew their parts. I wanted to pay for expertise. Barring that, I just needed to learn it myself and do it if I couldn’t afford to pay people for it.\n\nIt quickly occurred to me that this can be a big advantage. By having basic knowledge and skills in all areas of entrepreneurship, I was able to see where I could combine efforts. I just had to break things down into first principles and think about why I was doing each part. And after learning a bunch about each part, I hit on another revelation.\n\nThere are three components to an internet-native business that scales efficiently:\n\n1. The Product - this is something that you can produce at scale where the cost of production stays constant or rises at a fraction of the rate as sales can rise. This is what most people focus on when trying to create online businesses. SaaS products, info products, online courses, etc. The goal here is something that scales effectively.\n2. Education - Because there are so many different things online right now, you need to educate people about your product. Most people just put out a ton of content that brings people into their product. As they go on, they tend to build systems around their product that brings in qualified leads, educates them about the product, and keeps them around until they are ready to buy. Typically, this takes the form of an email list. Granted, it takes a lot of time to build up a large enough list to be effective, so this takes place over a long period of time. \n3. Media - Educational content needs amplified somehow. Most creators and startups rely on either traditional media outlets or social media outlets to amplify their content that then feeds into the mailing lists or their other educational content, that then leads into their products.\n\nMost people start by focusing on the product aspect. That’s the easiest part, especially for technical founders. It’s the thing they know best. Usually, the product is the main idea. As an entrepreneur, you see an opportunity, and you start with the product. Then you tend to add in the education and the media.\n\nThere’s a saying that first-time founders focus on the product and second-time founders focus on distribution. That’s exactly why. It’s a lot harder.\n\nBut what if it didn’t have to be?\n\nAs I started building out distribution systems, I started thinking about what could happen when we start sharing distribution networks. Normally, we pay for distribution, via advertising, placements, or we engage in activities like SEO. But when we start combining our distribution, our networks start growing exponentially and bad leads are recycled into good leads for others. \n\nThe internet has shown us the impacts of distribution at scale. We just tend to believe we need astronomical numbers to be successful. But the reality is that more targeted distribution can achieve outsized results with much smaller numbers. There are several companies that have distribution advantages due to being large and early. They have more data that they can use to hone their edge.\n\nBut that’s not an invincible moat: it can be defeated by better, more complete data. \n\nAnd higher trust.\n\nWith Build In Public University, I want to provide support mechanisms for the Education and Media components. We’ll offer a number of options for recording and distributing content and other material along collectively owned distribution channels. And there will be no need to maintain exclusivity. As entrepreneurs and creators build out their channels, they’ll be able to continue to publish on ours and theirs as well. \n\nIt takes time to build up skills and trust. By providing a high-trust environment that helps creators and founders build up the skills they need, we’ll be able to offer the scaffolding that they need in order to get started. \n\nAnd by offering access to experts that can help them level up their skills, they will be able to reach success levels much much faster. I’m in the process of coordinating with several other creators and experts in a number of different areas to bring them in as the professors for the initial class of Build In Public University. \n\nOne of the things I’ve been thinking about, though. How can I balance accessibility and sustainability? I want to open the university to anyone who needs it, but I also have to make sure that the experts who become professors and everyone who puts time and effort in are fairly compensated. So I’m planning on experimenting with various mechanisms to separate the payment mechanisms from the students.\n\nOne such mechanism is writing on Mirror. I’m planning on writing various essays that will be available for sale as NFTs. Each sale will allow a student to attend the university for free.\n\nIf you have a student that you would like to help attend, you can purchase one of these NFTs and send me a DM on Twitter: \n\n[https://twitter.com/leo_guinan](https://twitter.com/leo_guinan)\n\nOr, if you just want to help someone, I will be setting up a waiting list for people interested in attending and each time one sells, I’ll simply invite the next person on the list.\n\nStay tuned: I’ll be announcing the first group of professors in the coming weeks. The goal is to have a trial cohort run through the base curriculum in August and then have monthly cohorts after that. In addition to the cohort with the main content, each month will feature lessons taught be the various professors that I will be bringing onboard, covering a number of different topics related to building businesses.\n\nI’m excited to embark on this journey. By building a solid base of entrepreneurs building on their unique traits, we can begin to take back the convergent internet and turn it back into the divergent, unique, exciting experience that it used to be, while still maintaining the power of it.\n\nWon’t you join us?", "timestamp": 1658015168, "digest": "n1O5Uvxkb94YBQH2GcKLH2CUDwAGsTAf_BvHLEn2l-E", "contributor": "0x0BE197c794575579f2f238a68eDf2FC5F92817aC"}

Is that the guaranteed path to success?\n\nOk, let’s ask a different question: what does success look like?\n\nI can give you my answer, but I guarantee that that’s different from yours. Hell, it’s a lot different from my answer 6 months, 1 year, 5 years ago. I’ve been digging into it as I’ve gone about my journey. \n\nI wasn’t terribly ambitious in my youth. I went to a state university after getting decent grades in high school. I knew I wanted to be a programmer and I needed a Computer Science degree. That piece of paper was the proof I needed, so I went after it. \n\nI ran into a lot of trouble along the way. Undiagnosed ADHD played a huge roll in that. 7 years later though, I got that degree and then went on to start my career.\n\n10 years into my career, having taken the safe path the whole time, a global pandemic hit and I started re-evaluating my life. I discovered the ADHD and a side of Autism. A few months later, I quit my job and decided I needed something different. I had an idea and I realized that if I wanted to get where I wanted to be, things needed to change.\n\nIn true ADHD fashion, I made the change happen right that minute. Left my job with no notice and decided to figure it out along the way. I saw a world full of opportunities that I had missed and I tried to grab them all at once.\n\nIt didn’t go well. But I had lived the life that everyone told me I needed to live and for the first time in a long time, I was figuring out the life I wanted to live. Had no clue what the hell that looked like, but I was determined to figure it out. \n\nI was going to be an entrepreneur.\n\nSo I read everything I could find. I researched and experimented and tried. I did all sorts of shit. \n\nAnd I realized that most of it didn’t matter. The more I tried, the more I failed. The more I thought I understood, the more I realized how little I knew. The harder I pushed, the slower I moved.\n\nI’ve talked a lot about my first startup, so I’m not going to go into details here. But I’ll say this: my mental health was rocked. I didn’t have the support system I needed, I didn’t have the help I needed, and the resources I found didn’t fit my situation or my needs.\n\nSo I knew I wanted to help others avoid that. I ended up in a dark place before I shut things down to re-evaluate. I had to. I attached my entire self-worth to that startup, so shutting it down was painful.\n\nOne thing that I learned about myself: I was interested in teaching. I wanted to help others by sharing what I’ve learned along the way. I had a revelation: the longer removed from success given entrepreneurs were, the less useful their advice was. So instead of learning from the people who had done it before, I wanted to learn from those who were doing it. I fell into the Build In Public movement headfirst, because I was able to see things from the perspectives of the trenches.\n\nI’ve been working on courses for the past year. I launched my first course almost a year ago, after finishing up the On Deck Course Creator fellowship. I called it Supercharge Your Time and focused on teaching automation principles. As a software engineer, I wanted to help people see how systems worked and how they could build systems that would let them focus their time on what only they could do. It was a good experience, but then I ended up taking on a full-time job with a startup and didn’t run another cohort. But I also wasn’t completely satisfied with the course. There was more to it than that. Automation is one great way to save time, but there were other courses on automation that were more actionable. I dug into details and theories that students didn’t quite need. But the time I felt the best: when I was helping the students work through their specific problems. \n\nIt’s really tough to take a decade of experience in system design and distill it down for people in an actionable manner. But on a 1-1 basis, I can help people design systems that they can understand, because I can use the language that they use. It’s harder to create a general framework for people. \n\nSo I’ve been taking all of that experience, and working on general systems that people can use. I’ve created a ton of content, had multiple attempts and ideas at courses that fizzled out when I tried to get them going, and continued to distill things down as much as possible.\n\nThen I hit on a few things, all around the same time. I realized that content is currently converging - it’s all turning into a homogeneous blob that the algorithm likes. People see what the algorithms like and their content converges on that point. Platforms see this happening and tweak the algorithm. And the cycle continues. \n\nThat’s what happens when we all try to figure things out on our own. We all hit similar answers on what’s successful in the moment. And when you are trying to focus on short-term outcomes, that’s inevitable. And early on as an entrepreneur, it’s necessary to figure things out as quickly as possible, in order to get to a place of minimal stability. \n\nOne way to hit that stability: raise money. That’s what I thought the answer was at first. If I wanted to launch a startup, I needed to raise money, right? But I wanted to raise money in order to hire people who knew their parts. I wanted to pay for expertise. Barring that, I just needed to learn it myself and do it if I couldn’t afford to pay people for it.\n\nIt quickly occurred to me that this can be a big advantage. By having basic knowledge and skills in all areas of entrepreneurship, I was able to see where I could combine efforts. I just had to break things down into first principles and think about why I was doing each part. And after learning a bunch about each part, I hit on another revelation.\n\nThere are three components to an internet-native business that scales efficiently:\n\n1. The Product - this is something that you can produce at scale where the cost of production stays constant or rises at a fraction of the rate as sales can rise. This is what most people focus on when trying to create online businesses. SaaS products, info products, online courses, etc. The goal here is something that scales effectively.\n2. Education - Because there are so many different things online right now, you need to educate people about your product. Most people just put out a ton of content that brings people into their product. As they go on, they tend to build systems around their product that brings in qualified leads, educates them about the product, and keeps them around until they are ready to buy. Typically, this takes the form of an email list. Granted, it takes a lot of time to build up a large enough list to be effective, so this takes place over a long period of time. \n3. Media - Educational content needs amplified somehow. Most creators and startups rely on either traditional media outlets or social media outlets to amplify their content that then feeds into the mailing lists or their other educational content, that then leads into their products.\n\nMost people start by focusing on the product aspect. That’s the easiest part, especially for technical founders. It’s the thing they know best. Usually, the product is the main idea. As an entrepreneur, you see an opportunity, and you start with the product. Then you tend to add in the education and the media.\n\nThere’s a saying that first-time founders focus on the product and second-time founders focus on distribution. That’s exactly why. It’s a lot harder.\n\nBut what if it didn’t have to be?\n\nAs I started building out distribution systems, I started thinking about what could happen when we start sharing distribution networks. Normally, we pay for distribution, via advertising, placements, or we engage in activities like SEO. But when we start combining our distribution, our networks start growing exponentially and bad leads are recycled into good leads for others. \n\nThe internet has shown us the impacts of distribution at scale. We just tend to believe we need astronomical numbers to be successful. But the reality is that more targeted distribution can achieve outsized results with much smaller numbers. There are several companies that have distribution advantages due to being large and early. They have more data that they can use to hone their edge.\n\nBut that’s not an invincible moat: it can be defeated by better, more complete data. \n\nAnd higher trust.\n\nWith Build In Public University, I want to provide support mechanisms for the Education and Media components. We’ll offer a number of options for recording and distributing content and other material along collectively owned distribution channels. And there will be no need to maintain exclusivity. As entrepreneurs and creators build out their channels, they’ll be able to continue to publish on ours and theirs as well. \n\nIt takes time to build up skills and trust. By providing a high-trust environment that helps creators and founders build up the skills they need, we’ll be able to offer the scaffolding that they need in order to get started. \n\nAnd by offering access to experts that can help them level up their skills, they will be able to reach success levels much much faster. I’m in the process of coordinating with several other creators and experts in a number of different areas to bring them in as the professors for the initial class of Build In Public University. \n\nOne of the things I’ve been thinking about, though. How can I balance accessibility and sustainability? I want to open the university to anyone who needs it, but I also have to make sure that the experts who become professors and everyone who puts time and effort in are fairly compensated. So I’m planning on experimenting with various mechanisms to separate the payment mechanisms from the students.\n\nOne such mechanism is writing on Mirror. I’m planning on writing various essays that will be available for sale as NFTs. Each sale will allow a student to attend the university for free. It will include lifetime community access, 5 hours of 1-1 time with university professors in the 1st month, and 1 hour each month after that.\n\nIf you have a student that you would like to help attend, you can purchase one of these NFTs and send me a DM on Twitter: \n\n[https://twitter.com/leo_guinan](https://twitter.com/leo_guinan)\n\nOr, if you just want to help someone, I will be setting up a waiting list for people interested in attending and each time one sells, I’ll simply invite the next person on the list.\n\nStay tuned: I’ll be announcing the first group of professors in the coming weeks. The goal is to have a trial cohort run through the base curriculum in August and then have monthly cohorts after that. In addition to the cohort with the main content, each month will feature lessons taught be the various professors that I will be bringing onboard, covering a number of different topics related to building businesses.\n\nI’m excited to embark on this journey. By building a solid base of entrepreneurs building on their unique traits, we can begin to take back the convergent internet and turn it back into the divergent, unique, exciting experience that it used to be, while still maintaining the power of it.\n\nWon’t you join us?", "timestamp": 1658018386, "digest": "bKiUcsGXv4MBnRjfpOoAUIQ866DGsDKqKvKCCFV3izA", "contributor": "0x0BE197c794575579f2f238a68eDf2FC5F92817aC"}

ERC-721 两个值得注意的小细节\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nERC-721全称Ethereum Request for Comment-721（以太坊征求意见稿第721号）。它定义了一套代码规则，用于在以太坊区块链上记录与NFT有关的信息。它为任意的NFT指定了两个标识符：合约地址和token ID，它们的结合使得NFT真正实现独一无二。但这样的设计也有两个小细节值得关注：所有权和Metadata。\n\n所有权的问题在于：购买的NFT实际没有出现在个人名下，恰恰相反是个人名字记录在购买的 NFT之中。作者将其概述为：“不是你的NFT属于你，而是你属于你的NFT”。由此引申带来的潜在风险是尽管存储在区块链上的信息不能被更改，但信息在被检索和呈现时则可能会被扭曲，这从根本上限制了非托管钱包正确显示个人拥有的所有 NFT。\n\nMetadata的风险在于：ERC-721允许NFT的相关数据存储在链下并且可以被修改，因此未经所有者许可也存在metadata被篡改的可能。NFT的metadata以JSON的链接指向数据链接，具体数据则通常储存在链下、JSON链接也通常储存在链下，也就是NFT中只存储了一个指向其JSON文件的链接。举例说明要上传一个NFT的图像，需要经过四个步骤：\n\n1\\.上传图像到网上并生成一个链接。\n\n2\\.创建一个包含该链接以及其他相关信息的JSON文件。\n\n3\\.上传JSON文件并生成另一个链接。\n\n4\\.通过ERC-721合约中的URI将NFT指向第二个链接。\n\n问题出在步骤四：ERC-721允许将NFT与一个特定URI相关联，但这个URI是可变的。标准中没有规定一个NFT的图像应该是什么样子，也没有方法允许NFT所有者确认NFT指向的图像是否是正确的图像。由此而言ERC-721智能合约的所有者想要修改其中metadata的部分，单个 NFT所有者对此是无能为力的。\n\n究其根本，在购买NFT的行为中只是在将个人的名字写入以太坊分布式账册上的某一行。尽管构建区块链的初衷是为了消除第三方风险，但现阶段如果不依赖于中心化的服务提供商，这一行将很难被访问。同时，存储在该行上的其他信息可能会在没有个人同意的情况下被更改。由此可见现阶段的NFT并不能够像钻石一样恒久永流传。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nERC-721的出世为NFT带来了原始生命力，其魅力主要来源于独一无二的特性，然而所有权问题和metadata风险证明了现阶段的NFT仍不能算作真正意义上的去中心化产品。出现问题就得尝试解决问题：本人认为首要实现合约双方的完全去中心化，其次中心化的第三方也需要通过去中心化的方式证明其有效性，相当于多出了更复杂的验证步骤，可以理解为不可能三角对效率的再次弱化。当然，如何解决这一系列难题还需要更深入讨论和更细致实践，在现实情况下实现区块链去中心化的美好初衷仍是漫漫征途。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/nft-weekly-recap-two-caveats-with-the-design-of-erc-721](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/nft-weekly-recap-two-caveats-with-the-design-of-erc-721)\n\n### 第五篇20220716\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】Optimistic Rollup 和 ZK Rollup 两类以太坊 Layer-2 解决方案对比\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nOptimism 和 Arbitrum 是目前最重要的两个以太坊 Layer-2 解决方案，都使用了 Optimistic Rollup 技术来拓展以太坊网络。zkSync 和 StarkNet 则是目前使用 ZK Rollup 技术实现扩容的两个主要Layer-2解决方案。主流以太坊 Layer-2 解决方案 Rollup 的优势主要体现在：压缩上传以太坊主网数据，分摊交易的Gas费用；同时利用 Layer-1 区块链共识机制保证其安全性；吞吐量的增长潜力也会随 Layer-1 升级同步提高。由此费用更低、安全性有保证、性能也能够满足更高需求。\n\n### Arbitrum、Optimism、zkSync和StarkNet 技术层面差异\n\nOptimistic Rollup 的 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 存在着一些本质差别。Arbitrum 使用链下执行的多轮欺诈证明，且应用 Arbitrum 虚拟机（AVM）支持所有 EVM 编译语言。Optimism 使用 Layer-1 执行的单轮欺诈证明，兼用以太坊 EVM 而仅能支持 Solidity 编译器。相比较而言，前者技术层面更为领先。\n\nZK Rollup 的 zkSync 和 StarkNet 分别使用 SNARK 和 STARK 证明机制：差别在于设置过程、可扩展性和抗量子计算机攻击能力。ZK-SNARK 必须经过一个授信的设置阶段，降低了其去中心化程度。ZK-STARK 使用可公开验证的随机数来创建无需信任的可验证系统，从而免去了对授信设置的必要，去中心化程度更高。STARK 同时具有量子弹性、计算速度和规模扩展性的优势，但现阶段存在明显的技术瓶颈，因此 SNARK 的普及度更高。\n\nOptimistic Rollup 使用争端解决程序来保护交易安全性，ZK Rollup 则使用零知识数学证明进行交易验证。前者的主要优势是计算难度相对低、硬件要求更低，更易完善的EVM兼容而有着更高的普及度。但相对而言：前者受限于中心化定序器的信任问题存在着更高的安全风险，而且后者有着更低的提款延迟，还具备在未来启用隐私交易的潜力。基于以上特点，Vitalik Buterin 认为 Optimistic Rollup 在现阶段通用 EVM 计算中更胜一筹，但随着技术迭代，ZK Rollup 可能会有更大的发展空间。\n\n### Arbitrum、Optimism、zkSync和StarkNet 生态建设与发展规划\n\nTVL：Arbitrum > Optimism > zkSync > StarkNet (Optimistic Rollup >> ZK Rollup)。四者的 Dapp 成熟度、社交活跃度与 TVL 的比较结果相似。\n\nArbitrum 主体由 Offchain Labs 负责运营，目前积极推动 Arbitrum Odyssey 的 NFT 活动为后续规划埋下伏笔。Optimism 主要通过去中心化 DAO 治理，在推出治理通证 $OP 后热度高涨，未来两年的部分重点将放在应用下一代的交互式欺诈证明、分片 Rollup 和去中心化定序器。ZK Rollup 更多的是处于基础建设阶段：zkSync 目前聚焦其 V2 Alpha 主网的发布。StarkNet 则为主网正式发布做好准备工作，值得注意的是先于 zkSync 规划了原生通证的空投。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nOptimistic Rollup 目前已实现一定的技术落地，Arbitrum 和 Optimism 具备着先发优势，生态建设也都初现规模，但寻找 Layer-2 解决方案新增长点的责任也主要落在了其肩头，希望在未来能够首先看到 Optimistic Rollup 的破局，由此将爆发惊人的价值。ZK Rollup 的发展则处于非常早期的阶段，幸运的是还有相当长的时间用以观察 zkSync 和 StarkNet 在技术落地与生态建设两个方向上的持续发展。个人认为 zkSync 和 StarkNet 真正的价值捕获更可能发生在下一个周期，价值体现也值得期待。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/optimism-vs.-arbitrum-a-complete-comparison](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/optimism-vs.-arbitrum-a-complete-comparison)\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/zksync-vs-starkware-what-s-the-difference-between-the-top-two-zk-rollups](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/zksync-vs-starkware-what-s-the-difference-between-the-top-two-zk-rollups)\n\n### 认知蝗虫链接：\n\n[https://buidlerdao.notion.site/94957d0ab12c4d82aab8840ed7c34f96](https://buidlerdao.notion.site/94957d0ab12c4d82aab8840ed7c34f96)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658019283, "digest": "UfaSHn0qmbKMbLDjcgaQ3cSCyLAF8hQ1BZ7vlJutfmw", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

Monolith\n\n以太坊上做的所有事情，虽然这给你带来了最大的安全性和简单性，但它也带来了高成本和有限的扩容性。\n\n1. Rollup\n\n模块化扩展的最初突破，创建一个单独的执行层，锚定回以太坊进行结算。可以使用欺诈（Optimistic）或有效性（ZK）证明。\n\n1. Validium\n\n对 Rollup 的修改，将数据可用性移出以太坊，增加了扩容性，但牺牲了安全性。Validium 的数据可用性有数据可用性委员会，监护人等，与 Rollup 有不同的权衡，但安全性低于 Rollup。\n\n进入 Celestia，一个新的区块链，它被明确优化为模块化堆栈的一部分，完全专注于数据可用性和共识。\n\n在查看了博客和论坛帖子之后，到目前为止似乎已经提出了 3 个主要变体：\n\n1. 「主权 Rollup」\n\n最初提出的利用 Celestia 的模型是在顶部有一个单一的执行层。在这种设计中，运营商 「Rollup」交易并将其发布到 Celestia。但是，等等，如果 Celestia 没有执行，结算在哪里发生？\n\n事实证明，实际上不需要单独的结算层。仅当您想要在各层之间进行信任最小化的桥接时才需要它，这与以太坊 L2 非常相关，但与可以在内部进行欺诈或有效性证明的「主权」链无关。\n\n这一开始让我很吃惊，因为我唯一的经验是使用以太坊 L2，其中「Rollup」总是与「结算」结合在一起。但在独立链的背景下，Rollup 也可以是有用的，例如，这基本上是 Mina 所做的。\n\n1. 「结算 Rollup」\n\n这使得「Cevmos」产生，这是一个位于 Celestia 之上的专用结算链，其他执行链可以作为单个信任最小化「集群」的一部分锚定到该链上。\n\n虽然这使得 Celestia 链之间的信任最小化桥接成为可能，但这将是一个与以太坊隔离的全新集群，所以它是否能获得采用还有待观察。\n\n这给我们带来了第三个也是最终的设计：\n\n1. Celestium\n\n最新的设计是将 Celestia 用于数据可用性，使用以太坊进行共识和结算。换句话说，可以把 Celestium 看做是一个由 Celestia 支持的 Validium。\n\n一方面，Celestiums 可能是你能得到的最安全和最经济的 Validium 设计之一。另一方面，它仍然是一个 Validium。\n\n由于 EIP-4844 估计将在 2022 年底推出，目前还不清楚 Validiums 是否值得取舍。\n\n这不是对以太坊或 Celestia 的模块化扩容方法的全面概述，但是把所有的东西都放在一张图中确实对我有帮助。", "timestamp": 1658019337, "digest": "DRl0JNTsTxrfa3l4wo-KdSG7mavnaKyZUMRVhSOIbH0", "contributor": "0x33029Ea6583A999323B53e6DDa683a43091CC841"}

{"id": "b3WtCb_4CuULqlzsefUxKejJNHem4g3UrE5TPoeMdAk", "title": "the company", "body": "With the suit, the company is primed to enter a legal battle with the richest man in the world that risks dragging on for months. (Twitter filed a motion for expedited treatment of the case, requesting a four-day trial in September.) If it prevails, Twitter could effectively force a billionaire who, according to its own complaint, has repeatedly disparaged \"Twitter and its personnel\" to become its new owner.\n\nIt's a strange conundrum for the company — especially after its users and employees have expressed concerns about Musk as an owner — but since the deal price of $54.20 per share represents a huge premium over Twitter's current stock price, Twitter's board has a duty to shareholders to try to see the deal through, or at least to get as much money out of Musk as possible. And the only way a court will side in its favor is if Twitter shows it is making a good faith effort to complete the agreement.\n\n* \n\nAlternatively, Twitter could negotiate a lower price for the deal or a settlement that allows Musk to walk away — and hope that its shareholders don't disapprove. Or Musk could win and walk away, leaving Twitter with nothing, or worse. Deal or no deal, Musk remains one of Twitter's largest shareholders, but that too could change if he chooses to wash his hands of the company, with potential ripple effects for the company's other shareholders.\n\nIn the meantime, the company is left with distracted leadership and demoralized employees as well as users, advertisers and shareholders unclear about the platform's future.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine how the company is going to get itself together and go forward\" regardless of how the suit resolves, said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law. \"It may just not have a very happy resolution, unfortunately.\"\n\nTwitter declined to comment for this story. Musk has not commented directly on the lawsuit, but shortly after it was filed, he tweeted \"Oh the irony lol.\"\n\n### Bracing for a 'messy' legal battle\n\nIn his letter seeking to terminate the deal, Musk's legal team hinted at his likely arguments in the case. In addition to his claims that Twitter has not upheld its obligations to share information, the letter alleges (without providing evidence) that the company's public statements that fake and spam accounts make up around 5% of its monetizable daily active users were false or misleading.\n\n\"What he seems to be after here is an exit ticket to just get off the ride and walk away for nothing,\" said Eric Talley, a corporate law professor at Columbia Law School. But, he added, those arguments may be difficult to stand up in court. \"They all have a tinge of wishful thinking.\"\n\nIn particular, Musk's claim that he relied on misleading public statements by Twitter about bots when making the deal \"flies in the face of his entire behavior leading up to the transaction,\" Talley said. Twitter noted as much in its lawsuit, pointing to Musk's public statements about wanting to purchase the company so that he could \"defeat the spam bots.\" Essentially, it's hard for Musk to argue he didn't know about Twitter's bots when he explicitly said that was his reason for buying the company in the first place.\n\nTwitter's complaint also alleges that ​​on April 9, the day Musk said he wanted to buy Twitter outright instead of joining its board, Musk texted Twitter board chair Bret Taylor. In his text, Musk allegedly said that \"'purging fake users' from the platform had to be done in the context of a private company because he believed that it would 'make the numbers look terrible.'\"\n\n[Elon Musk pressured Twitter to give him access to a 'firehose' of data to evaluate bots. Now what?](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/17/tech/elon-musk-twitter-bots/index.html)\n\nTwitter's lawsuit also pushes back on the idea that it has resisted sharing information with Musk. On top of handing over its [\"firehose\" of data](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/tech/elon-musk-twitter-bots/index.html) about tweets on the platform and \"a detailed summary\" of its process for measuring bots, Twitter representatives also held multiple meetings with Musk's team and offered the opportunity for others, which Musk declined or ignored, the complaint alleges.\n\nLegal experts note that the original acquisition agreement grants Twitter significant leeway to determine if information requests are \"reasonable\" and tied to the completion of the deal, and to deny them if they could harm the company competitively.\n\nMusk also claims that Twitter violated an agreement to operate its business normally ahead of the merger by letting go of two executives and [announcing lay-offs](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/tech/twitter-recruiting-layoffs-elon-musk/index.html) of a portion of its recruiting team. Twitter, however, noted in its complaint that while Musk had requested a provision requiring Twitter to seek his consent before making such changes to its workforce, \"Twitter successfully struck that provision before signing\" the agreement. Furthermore, Twitter alleges that it tried to introduce employee retention programs, but Musk prevented them from being enacted.\n\nMusk will largely bear the burden of proving that he did not simply \"wake up with a huge financial hangover\" and that his claims are not a pretext to get out of the deal, according to Talley.\n\n\"It's going to be a very messy litigation,\" said Kenneth Henderson, a partner at law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.\n\n### 'How long can Twitter last?'\n\nUltimately, the court will examine whether or not there has been a breach of contract, either by Musk or Twitter. If it sides with Musk and finds that Twitter has breached the deal, it could allow the billionaire to walk away, and potentially sue the company for damages, experts say.\n\nBut if the court sides with Twitter and finds that Musk's attempts to exit amount to a violation of the deal, Twitter is entitled to ask the court, as it does in its suit, for specific performance, a remedy in which Musk would receive an injunction forcing him to close the deal. While specific performance clauses are often included in large corporate acquisition contracts, they don't often need to be executed, meaning the court will have limited precedent to rely on in evaluating the case between Twitter and Musk, according to Henderson.", "timestamp": 1658027458, "digest": "gUq8HspVZ6u-tWiaupH8wlyI9MiCSbSrap-mRCVYQhA", "contributor": "0xA74F7a12d1b3f66fafd95CeE1Dbf35aBFC2de1e7"}

Crossover SUVs, for some reason, have just never been Cadillac's best thing while they've been the industry's hottest item for almost 20 years. Cadillac's crossovers have, aside from their sharp exterior designs, seemed largely ordinary compared to luxury rivals. Cadillac has been much better at making compelling cars and, of course, the hulking Escalade, a luxuriously appointed truck-like SUV. Even so, Cadillac's been going up against well-established German luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes and has, generally, been competitive, at best, when it needs to give buyers reasons to try a Detroit brand, maybe for the very first time.\n\n* \n\nFrom the outside, the Lyriq looks like a fairly typical crossover SUV but with sharp edges and a low roofline.

Scavenging torrent websites for software keys and shortcuts on the internet.\n\nIf you are a superuser, find ways to build with the people around you, find ways to make the space better. If any of us wants to see the value of our bags increase it takes hours on top of hours of work and brain power to build better products.\n\nLastly, let's remember that the goal of crypto is to be your own bank. Be in full control of your assets and not let others take your crypto. Get your keys off centralized exchanges and put them into a hardware wallet yesterday.\n\nEnjoy the ride everyone! Next 10 years are going to be wild. See you on the otherside.\n\n## Phibacka31 Thoughts\n\n**HEALTH IN WEB3** - This week was an actual blur. A lot of that had to do with a weird wrist flair up I had that began during the Graveyard Shift last week. To be honest, it was a much needed wakeup call. Health is something that gets overlooked time and time again within the space and it was having a direct negative impact on my life. This past week has had me focus in much more on the simple things: Exercise, proper hydration, and cutting out most sugar. These things may seem easy, but when you’ve been conditioned by bad habits to ignore these important factors it catches up to you. I’ve felt different this week, but it is a great start to a new me.\n\n**BORED TV**- As I stated last week I have begun a journey of talking more Bored Ape with a few fellow apes: [BRYTE](https://twitter.com/BRYTE_A) & [A-Raving-Ape](https://twitter.com/ape3593)\nIt has been a blast to have a few streams and get to talk more about the ecosystem as a whole and really peel back some layers on the Otherdeeds.

Although it’s important, there are other things that need to be addressed before we throw the bulk of the burden on the user and demand they DYOR.\n\nTake flying for instance. There is a lot we don’t need to know in order to board a plane for travel. There is some light onboarding, extra assistance available (when needed), but other parts we often ignore. Very few read the booklets in front of the seats or pay attention to the droning of the stewardess on safety before take-off. That information only becomes relevant when the plane crashes.\n\nOperating a crypto wallet and using it to seamlessly sign into and access websites and dapps, without memorizing multiple logins and passwords, should be something a child and your grandmother can do. The day-to-day operations should be easy to navigate, not easy to compromise. If we crashed our planes as often as wallets and users were compromised we would still be using boats and automobiles.\n\n**Shout-Out this Week**\n\nGamestop Marketplace is something to take notice of. Educational materials, their own wallet, as well as allowing for metamask etc. Integration into not just twitter, but also Reddit (which addressed a key target audience: r/Wallstreetbets). Utilizing Layer 2s and making transactions cost no more than .21 cents USD. I was able to purchase a couple $4 comics and each one was about .18-.20 cents USD in gas.\n\nOtherside First Trip was incredible. “The King’s Alpha” as the cool kids would say, was the litepaper drop they snuck out after it finished. <https://otherside.xyz/litepaper#the-agora>\n\nHonestly take notes of the way in which they demo and tested things.

A lot of that had to do with a weird wrist flair up I had that began during the Graveyard Shift last week. To be honest, it was a much needed wakeup call. Health is something that gets overlooked time and time again within the space and it was having a direct negative impact on my life. This past week has had me focus in much more on the simple things: Exercise, proper hydration, and cutting out most sugar. These things may seem easy, but when you’ve been conditioned by bad habits to ignore these important factors it catches up to you. I’ve felt different this week, but it is a great start to a new me.\n\n**BORED TV**- As I stated last week I have begun a journey of talking more Bored Ape with a few fellow apes: [BRYTE](https://twitter.com/BRYTE_A) & [A-Raving-Ape](https://twitter.com/ape3593)\nIt has been a blast to have a few streams and get to talk more about the ecosystem as a whole and really peel back some layers on the Otherdeeds.

Read [Episode 1](https://bit.ly/3OopR1A) & [Episode 2 + 3](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/scuSB42Nf5YxYwqlQJj6U8Tl-IXvUG0cMUP1Br3yUy4) summary to better understanding.\n\nThis is a summary of the episode 4 in the 8-week educational series hosted by [SSV Network](https://twitter.com/ssv_network) on The Ethereum’s most exciting incoming event: The Merge !\n\nThis article will discuss:\n\na) Polygon’s approach under the current conditions of the market\n\nb) Impacts of The Merge on L2s, EVMs\n\nc) Polygon and its Ethereum scaling solutions\n\n***A. Polygon’s approach under the current conditions of the market***\n\n![Polygon's approach to cope with bear market](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-hUJQIRACzZJCButHFNc2.png?height=687&width=1221)\n\nSimilar to Stani's perspective on bear markets in part 2, Sandeep stated that the signal-to-noise ratio decreases during bear markets. He continued by saying that Polygon has raised $450M during this downturn and that its visibility is increasing significantly. Additionally, they intend to support numerous products and will make the Zero-Knowledge EVM announcement at EthCC Paris.\n\nIn order to further support his argument, Sandeep argues that while things are more fundamentally based during a bear market—people are more concerned with construction, utility, etc.—during a bull market, the opposite is true. More people are concerned about price hikes and the level of noise in the web 3 market.\n\nSandeep Nailwal believes that this is an ideal time to create on platforms like web3, ethereum, polygon, and others. He tells the public that Polygon is currently working on several product lines and planning for the next 4–5 years.\n\nSandeep Nailwal wants to continue the Ethereum's ecosystem expansion. Users are to be informed about the ecosystem's operation, its enormous size and scope, as well as the benefits and importance of developing on ethereum and the ecosystem, according to Polygon's strategy. As of now, Polygon has been trying to attract 1 billion users to Web3.\n\nSmart contacts and EVM will continue to operate as usual because the Merge won't actually alter anything in L2s. Sandeep claims that Polygon isn't actually getting ready for the upcoming integration. The check point systems will still include retrials in the unlikely event of \"down-time.\" Due to its involvement in the ethereum ecosystem, Polygon will experience downtime with its ethereum validators. Retry attempts will be distributed across all validators in a long-term format to fix this.\n\n***B. Impacts of The Merge on L2s, EVMs***\n\n![Impacts of the Merge on L2s & EVMs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zyd217shpsxAP1LNCwu7c.png?height=700&width=1600)\n\nIn essence, Layer-2s independently process transactions to process more transactions per second with lower gas fees; the transactions are later recorded in the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, if ethereum scales in the future, L2s will do so as well (sharding). Tens of thousands more L2s can be created thanks to eth 2.0's improved community layer settlement, which also improves the ETH ecosystem. And things will only get more interesting once ETH turns green. \n\nEthereum will serve as a security and settlement layer while the majority of user activities take place on L2s. The Merge will fortify the web3 ecosystem even more and shift it toward being more environmentally friendly.\n\n***C. Polygon and its Ethereum scaling solutions***\n\n![Polygon's scaling solutions](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-znaA6gpcmluL9cK0s7lB.png?height=1200&width=2000)\n\nLayer 2 scaling is accomplished by Polygon using a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators and off-chain computation on sidechains. One of the most widely used platforms for scaling solutions today is still Polygon.\n\nPolygon is working on plenty of projects at the same time. This allows Polygon to have modularity while also improving the overall efficiency.\n\nPolygon had a Green PoS chain of its own even before the Merge. When considered separately, the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm used by Polygon results in a very small carbon footprint. In the past, networks like Polygon PoS used their low emissions to set themselves apart from energy-hungry platforms like Ethereum and position themselves as a greener option.\n\nPolygon PoS is also introduce their Ethereum scaling solutions:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MxW2M1n6TLoVAOmiktQ8N.png?height=663&width=1204)\n\n* zkEVM: The Hermez team is behind zkEVM. It will be introduced at EthCC Paris and is a Zero-Knowledge roll-up compatible with EVM.\n* Polygonal Avail: To save money compared to putting the data on Ethereum, Polygon Avail will be used for ordering and availability of the data.\n* Polygon Supernets: Application-specific chains called polygon supernets will only be protected by MATIC.\n* Polygon Edge: A modular and extensible framework for building private or public Ethereum-competible blockchain networks.\n* Polygon Nightfall: Polygon is creating Polygon Nightfall. It is an L2 rollup solution with a privacy-focused to enable privacy for businesses looking to use Ethereum. \n* Polygon Miden: a general-purpose Zero-Knowledge rollup based on STARK that supports any kind of smart contract. According to Sandeep, the development of Miden will take about three to five years.\n* Polygon Zero: a rollup with zero knowledge and provides greater throughput at lower costs. Sandeep estimates that it will take 18 to 24 months for Polygon Zero to fully function.\n* Polygon ID: a web3 user-owned identity system that is native to the blockchain. It provides scalable on-chain verification and total user privacy.\n\nAccording to Sandeep, Polygon is the main defense L2 using Ethereum security. Enterprises always prioritize security and privacy on the Ethereum ecosystem. These Ethereum advantages aid them in persuading and closing these deals, making them the preferred option for enterprises. \n\n***Consequently, you might want to know what is  [SSV Network](https://twitter.com/ssv_network) ?***\n\nSSV, or Secret Shared Validators, is an open source network protocol that allows developers to maximize ETH staking rewards while minimizing risk. This is made possible by scalable [distributed validator technology](https://ssv.network/tech/).\n\nIt is the first secure and reliable method of dividing an ETH validator key between anonymous nodes or operators. As an open-source protocol, SSV Network enables the community development, smooth operation of Ethereum nodes and fully decentralization.\n\n![The Merge series by SSV Network](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9pZlw_hiRxY-U6JFDbp1C.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\nJoin the 8-week [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YqJDqqQZvvxV) series to learn more about the on-in-a-lifetime upcoming event on Ethereum: The Merge!\n\n***Reference***\n\n[https://ssv.network/tech/](https://ssv.network/tech/)\n\n[https://coinnounce.com/will-the-merge-impact-other-ether-layer-2-chains/](https://coinnounce.com/will-the-merge-impact-other-ether-layer-2-chains/)\n\n[https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/)\n\n[https://blog.polygon.technology/](https://blog.polygon.technology/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658027676, "digest": "pYR1YCsKt5YQ9Gfhf2qHNJwtcdyPCWjyIuAYSG_BMuY", "contributor": "0xFa68640b8110Cd98671d359492F940CC6957E6e9"}

Health is something that gets overlooked time and time again within the space and it was having a direct negative impact on my life.

These things may seem easy, but when you’ve been conditioned by bad habits to ignore these important factors it catches up to you. I’ve felt different this week, but it is a great start to a new me.\n\n**BORED TV**- As I stated last week I have begun a journey of talking more Bored Ape with a few fellow apes: [BRYTE](https://twitter.com/BRYTE_A) & [A-Raving-Ape](https://twitter.com/ape3593)\nIt has been a blast to have a few streams and get to talk more about the ecosystem as a whole and really peel back some layers on the Otherdeeds. The key here is to drive exploration and intrigue to the Otherside as we all build together. We will be interviewing holders and builders within Web3 with a focus on the metaverse and more specifically the Otherside. I hope you join in on the ride.\n\n**MEMBERSHIP NFTs** - We’ve talked about this a number of times on the Graveyard Shift and it has been on my mind once again: How badass are membership NFTs? I mean think about it. You can tie real life Web2 type companies with a Web3 type membership that can last forever. I love the idea of creating and building a collective community that gets to enjoy some real life utility however that may be. Shoutout to Rebud and what they are doing with marijuana ordering and distribution as they continue to expand. It also made me think about an NFT that came out a year ago that I was interviewed for.\nThe basis of this NFT was a Beer For Life token that could be purchased by patrons of the Denver Beer Co. It sold, via auction, for 4.33 ETH, which at the time was $9,200. I truly believe this is a play that will continue to expand as more and more companies dip their toes into the space to create this Web3 family. Read more here: Beer For Life\n\n**OTHERSIDE FIRST TRIP**- OMG. I mean honestly it blew me away. I realize that some of this was reskinning game that they have been building for some time, but my goodness. I was not expecting so much to do on the very first trip. I am already looking forward to the amazing things that we will be able to take part in as the Otherside develops. I can guarantee you that people would much rather go to the Otherside than sit in discord all day talking. I’ve also got my eyes peeled for that first concert in the Otherside. I truly cannot wait to see what’s next.\n\n## Dontfeedwolfeth Thoughts\n\n**Thoughts while Traveling** \n\nI used to be a big proponent of Education in this space. Although it’s important, there are other things that need to be addressed before we throw the bulk of the burden on the user and demand they DYOR.\n\nTake flying for instance. There is a lot we don’t need to know in order to board a plane for travel. There is some light onboarding, extra assistance available (when needed), but other parts we often ignore. Very few read the booklets in front of the seats or pay attention to the droning of the stewardess on safety before take-off. That information only becomes relevant when the plane crashes.\n\nOperating a crypto wallet and using it to seamlessly sign into and access websites and dapps, without memorizing multiple logins and passwords, should be something a child and your grandmother can do. The day-to-day operations should be easy to navigate, not easy to compromise. If we crashed our planes as often as wallets and users were compromised we would still be using boats and automobiles.\n\n**Shout-Out this Week** \n\nGamestop Marketplace is something to take notice of.

A lot of that had to do with a weird wrist flair up I had that began during the Graveyard Shift last week. To be honest, it was a much needed wakeup call. Health is something that gets overlooked time and time again within the space and it was having a direct negative impact on my life. This past week has had me focus in much more on the simple things: Exercise, proper hydration, and cutting out most sugar. These things may seem easy, but when you’ve been conditioned by bad habits to ignore these important factors it catches up to you. I’ve felt different this week, but it is a great start to a new me.\n\n**BORED TV**- As I stated last week I have begun a journey of talking more Bored Ape with a few fellow apes: [BRYTE](https://twitter.com/BRYTE_A) & [A-Raving-Ape](https://twitter.com/ape3593)\nIt has been a blast to have a few streams and get to talk more about the ecosystem as a whole and really peel back some layers on the Otherdeeds. The key here is to drive exploration and intrigue to the Otherside as we all build together. We will be interviewing holders and builders within Web3 with a focus on the metaverse and more specifically the Otherside. I hope you join in on the ride.\n\n**MEMBERSHIP NFTs** - We’ve talked about this a number of times on the Graveyard Shift and it has been on my mind once again: How badass are membership NFTs? I mean think about it. You can tie real life Web2 type companies with a Web3 type membership that can last forever. I love the idea of creating and building a collective community that gets to enjoy some real life utility however that may be. Shoutout to Rebud and what they are doing with marijuana ordering and distribution as they continue to expand. It also made me think about an NFT that came out a year ago that I was interviewed for.\nThe basis of this NFT was a Beer For Life token that could be purchased by patrons of the Denver Beer Co. It sold, via auction, for 4.33 ETH, which at the time was $9,200. I truly believe this is a play that will continue to expand as more and more companies dip their toes into the space to create this Web3 family. Read more here: Beer For Life\n\n**OTHERSIDE FIRST TRIP**- OMG. I mean honestly it blew me away. I realize that some of this was reskinning game that they have been building for some time, but my goodness. I was not expecting so much to do on the very first trip. I am already looking forward to the amazing things that we will be able to take part in as the Otherside develops. I can guarantee you that people would much rather go to the Otherside than sit in discord all day talking. I’ve also got my eyes peeled for that first concert in the Otherside. I truly cannot wait to see what’s next.\n\n## Dontfeedwolfeth Thoughts\n\n**Thoughts while Traveling**\n\nI used to be a big proponent of Education in this space. Although it’s important, there are other things that need to be addressed before we throw the bulk of the burden on the user and demand they DYOR.\n\nTake flying for instance. There is a lot we don’t need to know in order to board a plane for travel. There is some light onboarding, extra assistance available (when needed), but other parts we often ignore. Very few read the booklets in front of the seats or pay attention to the droning of the stewardess on safety before take-off. That information only becomes relevant when the plane crashes.\n\nOperating a crypto wallet and using it to seamlessly sign into and access websites and dapps, without memorizing multiple logins and passwords, should be something a child and your grandmother can do. The day-to-day operations should be easy to navigate, not easy to compromise. If we crashed our planes as often as wallets and users were compromised we would still be using boats and automobiles.\n\n**Shout-Out this Week**\n\nGamestop Marketplace is something to take notice of. Educational materials, their own wallet, as well as allowing for metamask etc. Integration into not just twitter, but also Reddit (which addressed a key target audience: r/Wallstreetbets). Utilizing Layer 2s and making transactions cost no more than .21 cents USD. I was able to purchase a couple $4 comics and each one was about .18-.20 cents USD in gas.\n\nOtherside First Trip was incredible. “The King’s Alpha” as the cool kids would say, was the litepaper drop they snuck out after it finished. <https://otherside.xyz/litepaper#the-agora>\n\nHonestly take notes of the way in which they demo and tested things.

{"id": "_YQZHbgcrvGNo-_NebzMn7TbLr1_FPLgQprXxAw0dSY", "title": "big storage", "body": "With its flat floors and big storage bins, the Lyriq also makes excellent use of the extra space that electric vehicles allow thanks to their small motors and lack of transmission. There's no front trunk, since GM designers said they wanted to package electrical and mechanical equipment under the hood to make for more room elsewhere.\n\n* \n\nThe interior of the Cadillac Lyriq is nicely designed and finished, although some parts don't feel up to the competition.\n\nThe shift to electric vehicles could provide the opportunity Cadillac needs to set itself apart. The Lyriq genuinely looks and drives like a luxury crossover. On the road, it's smooth, controlled and quiet. Press on the accelerator pedal and there's more than ample power. It hustles without feeling rushed.\n\nThe Lyriqs GM provided for test drives were among the first built. GM executives hurried the model's introduction, beating its original deadline by almost a year, but some features won't go into production until later. All-wheel-drive, for instance, won't be available for some months because the additional front motor that will provide that feature is still being tested and refined. So the Lyriq I tested was rear-wheel-drive. Similarly, GM's [Super Cruise](https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/12/technology/cadillac-super-cruise/index.html) hands-free highway driving system is still being tested for this model. It will be available later either on new Lyriqs as they're built on the assembly line or as a software download for vehicles already in customers' driveways.\n\nEven without all the features and all the power that extra motor will bring — the rear-wheel-drive Lyriq gets 340 horsepower from its one motor vs. 500 from the two-motor version — the Lyriq is very nice to drive. As with most luxury vehicles these days, the driver can select different \"modes\" that alter the accelerator pedal response and steering quickness, plus, of course, the artificial motor sound. The suspension firmness, however, cannot be changed. GM engineers say it responds automatically, using sophisticated fluid relays, to the needs of the moment, firming up when more body control is needed for turns but softening at other times to absorb bumps.", "timestamp": 1658027803, "digest": "KysY3emuM6aPQ7aUgjtN1u98_ZkYgAhyQtKYURpbGh8", "contributor": "0x0d97ABde6be9e7ed6B757866D00563CDA0eF4753"}

VeryCB\n\n> 可组合性比较强大的一点是，比如一个项目想读取 NFT 的 traits 然后使用，以前只能去把所有的 metadata 都拉下来，然后自己解析完了再用到自己的项目里。Tableland 可以做到直接 SQL 查询想要的结果，不需要自己拉下来再解析，技术层面实现了原生的结构化数据\n\n2\\.

发布积分质押计划；\n\nQ3发布INKE社交型产品The Place，赋能INKEPASS的持有者，建造映客元宇宙的第一颗社交星球；\n\nQ4发布The Place 2.0版，升级社交功能，添加活动功能。\n\n### 6.The Place到底要做什么？作为一款APP，在web3里怎么串联起这些NFT的项目？\n\nThe Place是一个线上虚拟现实的社交产品，我们希望通过将线下的社交互动行为通过3D的方式进行还原，打造一个多元场景，富有沉浸体验的社交互动平台。 Place同时兼容web2和web3，web3里的NFT是Place里社交的核心元素。\n\n### 7.The Place成功的阶段性目标有哪些？投入多少预算去实现？如果阶段性目标没有实现有什么备份计划？\n\nThe Place短期目标在于打造场景和完善用户体验为目标，以及逐步渗透nft的结合场景，中长期还是会结合nft做更多的深入场景；在内容生产方面，前期以平台PGC为主，中期逐渐为用户提供DIY功能往UGC发展 - 这也是元宇宙产品的必经之路试错成本低，可以投入有限的资金验证需求。\n\n所有的互联网产品都是从很小的产品去验证，验证完后，它会长大。如果它能创造很强的体验、具有强社交性强、传播性，可能瞬间会从10万用户膨胀到1000万用户。映客直播当年也从刚开始几个月没有人直播，只有三五个人，到突然一夜之间变成几十万人直播，然后变成全社交事件。所谓的社交产品它都是一个强爆发力，核心本质是能否真正做出强用户体验、强口碑、强传播的产品。\n\n对于营收和预算来说，这是一个动态尝试的过程，元宇宙是一个更新的项目，核心的判断会依据数据变化做决策。可能在三五年之后它会到达爆发点，但在这前几年是要有有积累有沉淀的。\n\n坦白来讲，目前还很初期，我们从0-1，相当于元宇宙的创业公司。看产品究竟多有影响力，还是要等它真正发布的时候，从用户体验来看，有可能它是成功的，也有可能是失败的，这都是正常状态，核心的还是要在大的方向下，做出正确选择和资源投入，在元宇宙趋势下，我们未来会有越来越多的产品去呈现和发布，也有信心和能力把这些产品做出符合商业逻辑的生态。\n\n预算：分阶段来看，初期在产品验证阶段低成本快速迭代，打磨产品体验优化产品数据，同时探索商业模式；产品验证+商业闭环验证完毕，可无上限投入。\n\n备份计划：xx用户 + xx场景 + xx社交需求，针对这3个维度做排列组合，比如我们初期是针对 欧美用户 + 实时互动场景  + 陌生社交需求。\n\n补充说明一下映客在整体元宇宙层面上的投入，元宇宙对技术挑战还挺大的，包括虚拟人、虚拟场景，从企业管理方面，会根据当下时机、发展的情况去投入，如果投入会让护城河越扎越深、经济模型完全闭环，也可以是无上限的投入。如果投入是死胡同，肯定不会了。\n\n我们有自己的技术和资源，也会和第三方合作，生态的分工和合作很明确。没有必要每一个轮子自己制作，重要的是能把外面所有的模块组件组合起来去做创新，像苹果也并不是每个部件都自制发明而创造，它重要的是组合创新。\n\n现在短时间内元宇宙的比拼和竞争的要点不在技术，技术的基础设施并不算元宇宙真正的基础设施，目前国内外的公司都没有搭建起来，元宇宙真正的大规模发展，必须等到顶级硬件终端的发布才会对行业产生颠覆性的影响。映客做的是应用层面的创新。映宇宙是由一个一个产品代表的小宇宙共同构成的。\n\n## 第二部分:里程碑项目YING的内容解读\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pY8G6jatAxfYPP3b_uEs.gif?height=750&width=750)\n\n### 1.我们进入第二部分，里程碑项目YING的内容解读。之前在Mirror上发了一篇文章哈，YING-超越之路\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU](https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU)\n\n### 现在给大家详细介绍一下YING的定位：\n\n映映-YING，映宇宙生态型企业形象IP，映宇宙的数字代言人。在产品形态上：映映将在映宇宙中有着不同的身份以及多重任务，我们会看到映映经常出现在积目、超级喜欢、映客直播、情侣星球、原原世界、The Place等社交星球中。\n\n在视觉呈现上：她有四种身份：元宇宙映映，运动达人映映，潮人映映，游戏NPC映映，之后大家也会在制作的NFT系列里发现他们的不同。\n\n在品牌发展的角度：未来，映宇宙将和更多知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌，进行服装、配饰设计。映映（YING NFT ) + 虚拟时尚NFT，能够让IP触达到真正的用户群体和粉丝，也能够帮助映宇宙将线下用户带到线上，让每一个社区用户可以参与到IP运营和共创中，共建映宇宙的Web3新生态。\n\n在社区方面：每一位持有者都将与映映的IP深度绑定，包括品牌合作、NFT系列相关产品等权益。品牌系统形成后，项目合作奖励和社区收益将基于链上记录的贡献。数据将透明的分发给社区成员。\n\n### 2.YING系列为什么定为了7777这个数量？\n\n首先是代表7周年。INKEPASS的1111和Hootbirds的1111，加起来正好是9999，这个也是主流NFT项目的一个体量。另外，在NFT的制作上，我们也有跟数字相关的彩蛋，大家可以关注一下。后面会有很多有意思的玩儿法，这些数字也是跟映客的开始和成长都息息相关的。\n\n### 3.YING是以品牌的角度去发展，这方面有哪些规划可以提前透露的吗？\n\n是的，映映路线图的中心是通过YING链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n有几个部分吧，首先，大背景是映宇宙已经准备好了：\n\n1. 映宇宙会为用户提供更实时的、更同步的、更沉浸式的体验，从2D到3D，从手机到AR/VR，让我们疯狂的想象，借助 AR/VR在映宇宙里进行虚拟社交！\n2. 映宇宙的内容生态由平台和用户共建，除了PGC还有UGC甚至AIGC，我们将为用户提供便捷的创作工具，一起打造丰富的映宇宙内容生态！\n3. 映宇宙会由多个社交元宇宙平台矩阵组成，映映会以映宇宙企业形象IP和数字代言人出现在映宇宙的各个社交元宇宙平台！\n\n**第二方面是生态的共建：**\n\n1. 映宇宙的建立和拓展，需要优秀的人才和团队，HootLabs除了自己的产品研发之外，我们也在持续寻找与我们有共同愿景的最优秀的人才和项目，目前有找我们的一些NFT的数据工具，一些创作者工具等。我们会觉得最有生命力最有意思的创意一定来源于社区，因为社区是最了解项目的人，也是深度参与的人，所以有web3赛道投融资方面的holder优先联系我，之后大家可以加我discord一起探讨；\n2. 映宇宙将与HootLabs社区一起探讨和策划，将映映以更合适且有效的方式引入web3.0并拓展影响力，大家可以投票参与一些组织决策，一起建议建设品牌的全面发展。\n\n**第三方面上品牌建设：**\n\n映映是一个来源于web3，走入web2的形象，链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n\n1\\.持续打造和提升映映在社交媒体影响力，策划内容、服装、场景，完善内容储备；\n\n2\\.以异业合作为主，通过品牌联动、平台联动、艺人联动等增加映映曝光及影响力；\n\n3\\.与各平台相关领域运营建立合作关系，获得流量支持及参与平台活动，拓展商业空间；\n\n4\\.与知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌；\n\n5\\.打造有影响力的直播事件，回馈粉丝及用户；\n\n6\\.策划后续商业合作及广告、代言及周边制作。\n\n让一个nft系列 一个IP更有价值 对于我们来说不是制作更多的nft，而是让这个IP不断的出圈，经营以及合作。我们应该应该相信作为映宇宙的代言人，映映在这方面将有无限的潜力。\n\n**第四方面，制作中的隐藏彩蛋**\n\n隐藏彩蛋会在Twitter和Discord公布，请大家及时关注公告信息。\n\n**第五方面，更多的线下活动**\n\n1\\.带着映映和HootLabs社区用户走进映宇宙的线下社交空间，包括但不限于超级喜欢线下体验店，积目酒吧线下体验店；\n\n2\\.与多家线下商业空间建立合作关系，定期举办映映粉丝线下活动见面会；\n\n3\\.积极参加web3.0行业峰会以及相关NFT展会，持续增加HootLabs和映映的曝光度和影响力。\n\n## 第三部分：自由问答\n\n### Q:为什么能吸引用户用place？Place的哪些功能是web2的app解决不了的？\n\nA:传统的2D社交、交友方式更多是在解决人机交互和信息分发的问题，互动的双方通过信息和内容的交换达成匹配关系，用户本身对于自身的操控感和所属感不强。而真实的线下交友和社交方式更自然，更强调“实时反馈”，3D结合音视频互动会让用户能够更有身临其境的感觉，最大程度上还远了线下的及时反馈和对自我及环境的掌控感。\n\n相比web2，Place引入了NFT作为核心的社交元素，NFT是在web3世界里的是互通的，是属于用户自己的数字资产，NFT代表了用户的圈层、标签、审美、资产，在Place里对用户的Profile是很有力的补充，同时NFT可自动标记人群分类，让各个项目的家人们更容易找到彼此，NFT在place里为用户提供更好更便捷的社交。\n\n### Q:目标用户是谁，具备什么特征？通过什么渠道和方法吸引和触达这批人？\n\nA:目标用户为对于游戏和社交界限感相对不那么敏感的z时代群体，这部分群体对于新产品和新形态持开放态度，传统的社交产品已经无法满足这类用户对于强互动、多元性、即使反馈等的诉求。前期用户群主打欧美市场，中后期会逐渐铺开到全球其他地区。\n\nWeb2方式：通过目标群里接受度较高的社交媒体对产品进行曝光和营销、同时结合产品功能和特定场景生成一些可分享、邀请的场景进行产品内的裂变；web3方式：与web3项目方进行市场合作，以项目入驻的方式进行用户群拓展\n\n### Q：有哪些线下场景的规划吗？例如开店\n\nA：整个映宇宙就是做先上线下的产品矩阵，超级喜欢 积目 都会有线下的体验店和多家合作的商业空间，也会跟艺术家合作，推出我们的吃服装和潮流线下的店，关于线下店是我们可以轻松拿下的项目，可谓势在必得到时也会定期举办一些holder的线下活动。\n\n### Q：INKEPASS在公司的定位？INKEPASS前期宣传不多，关于YING的赋能规划？\n\nA：我们也会分析每个NFT的定位和长期发展路线，INKEPASS 是结合web3 和其他项目的钥匙，在INKEPASS 前期的一些活动比较少，我们的重心放在了Hootbirds和YING的制作上， YING后期会加强活动，投入的资源和精力都会更多，希望用户给我们一些时间，看到我们的决心和改变，因为品牌升级，品牌形象也从猫头鹰升级为YING，因为我们有30天退款保障，代表映客7周年，价格上不会表现太差，YING最有可能打造为蓝筹的项目\n\n### Q：何时能使用到The Place？\n\nA：The place将会在8月上线", "timestamp": 1658029639, "digest": "_8gAx6AAsHplaoWoNORU07y8hWQxuzOTQUZ4cc6sVIw", "contributor": "0x8c41dDc92dFf79746F8D7Ba8B2af8031a60911FF"}

{"id": "jEwC5Mu54L-ox9ra4yH_OHm24pAW4J1aGVJRKVJHLxQ", "title": "7月16日 YING Talk VOL1 内容回顾", "body": "### 本次AMA将有三部分内容：\n\n### 第一部分：HootLabs社区用户问题回顾\n\n### 第二部分：里程碑项目YING的内容解读\n\n### 第三部分：自由问答\n\n## 第一部分：HootLabs社区用户问题回顾\n\n### 1.映客进入web3的主线是什么？\n\n今年我们公司的战略方向调整为元宇宙，并且在6.15号进行了公司品牌升级 - 由映客升级为映宇宙，这也凸显了我们进军元宇宙的决心。\n\n去年21年我们就在研究元宇宙，关于元宇宙的定义和描述有很多，截止目前元宇宙仍然没有清晰且唯一的定义，我们研究下来总结了行业对元宇宙的概念有以下4点的共识：\n\n1）元宇宙会给用户提供更实时的、更INKEPASS 是映客元宇宙的mintpass和核心权益通证，是开启映客元宇宙奇妙之旅的钥匙。在未来用户将通过这把钥匙逐步解锁Inke在web3的布局；\n\nINKEPASS 将铸造在以太链上。数量：1111枚，1000枚用于公开销售，111枚团队自留。价格为 0.1eth同步的、更沉浸式的体验，更多是从移动端2D到3D，以及从手机设备到AR/VR可穿戴设备；\n\n2）元宇宙里面的内容生态是由平台和用户共建，除了PGC还有UGC甚至AIGC，需要提供便捷的创作者工具；\n\n3）元宇宙平台里面生产的内容、数据、资产应该属于用户本身，不应该因平台某一天关掉，用户数据也丢失了；\n\n4）元宇宙里面需要有一套完备的经济体系，用户可能在元宇宙里面有一份可观的收入，或者能够取代用户在真实物理世界里的工作。\n\n结合以上4点认知，我们在元宇宙布局分了两个大的方向，一个方向是体验层面的，也就是1和2，将产品体验从2D升级到3D，并且探索AR/VR下一代智能设备；另一个方向是数据和资产层面的，也就是3和4，这也是web3的范畴。\n\n所以，进入web3大前提是我们公司要进军元宇宙，结合我们对元宇宙的认知我们除了在体验层面做战略布局之外，也需要在数据和资产层面也就是web3方向做战略布局，这是我们进入web3的主线。\n\n### 2.认为进入web3的成功标志是什么？\n\n在web3方面我们还处于相对早期的阶段，除了研究行业里的优质项目，调研各个赛道可能存在的机会，我们也在做web3项目的孵化和投资，想要从各个维度完善上面提到的几方面的布局。\n\n我们认为一个项目的成功标志是：通过提供产品和服务，解决了用户的需求和痛点，为用户提供实用的产品价值 - 这和是否与web3无关，所有成功的产品都应该具备这个特点。\n\n这个也是健康的项目能吸引用户留存的关键，真实的应用场景，跟生活方式息息相关，健康完善的经济体系。我觉得对于用户体验，用户层面的互动娱乐、社交需求挖掘和产品塑造是映客的强项，和写在基因里的优势。产品端的优势带入到web3里，会有更多的可能性。\n\n### 3.在集团层面，想把web3做成什么规模？投入人力物力如何？\n\n我们公司的优势是做互动娱乐和社交，所以我们更希望在社交方向做布局，社交产品的天花板和想象空间比较高，所以做成会有很大的用户规模\n\n核心业务团队20人左右；除此之外，元宇宙中后台团队上百人为业务团队提供支撑；与此同时战投部门会做战略布局。\n\n### 4.项目方如何对INKEPASS做更好的价值支撑，或者在哪些方面让pass的价值更高一些？\n\n我们认为INKEPASS的价值，是与HootLabs社区建设和发展是强相关的。我们会在社区方面持续进行建设：\n\n1、市场方面：与更多项目方建立合作，拓宽HootLabs社区用户覆盖面，为社区用户争取其他项目的各种权益和利益；\n\n2、运营方面：丰富社区玩法，推出NFT质押和积分商城，加强社群线上活动，并启动线下活动的组织；\n\n3、项目方面：随着HootLabs web3项目落地，例如The Place，给予HootLabs NFT Holders持续的空投和权益赋能；\n\n4、社区方面：我们会在合适的时间节点，把HootLabs版税收入的一部分，拿出来反馈给社区，让家人与项目方一起来共建HootLabs社区。\n\n### 5.HootLabs的roadmap回顾\n\n2022\\.6发行权益通证，品牌升级，全面布局映客元宇宙生态，打造矩阵化社交产品；发布映客纪念版NFT；社区中建立collab giveaway频道，给用户福利；\n\n2022\\.7发布里程碑式NFT项目; 发布积分质押计划；\n\nQ3发布INKE社交型产品The Place，赋能INKEPASS的持有者，建造映客元宇宙的第一颗社交星球；\n\nQ4发布The Place 2.0版，升级社交功能，添加活动功能。\n\n### 6.The Place到底要做什么？作为一款APP，在web3里怎么串联起这些NFT的项目？\n\nThe Place是一个线上虚拟现实的社交产品，我们希望通过将线下的社交互动行为通过3D的方式进行还原，打造一个多元场景，富有沉浸体验的社交互动平台。 Place同时兼容web2和web3，web3里的NFT是Place里社交的核心元素。\n\n### 7.The Place成功的阶段性目标有哪些？投入多少预算去实现？如果阶段性目标没有实现有什么备份计划？\n\nThe Place短期目标在于打造场景和完善用户体验为目标，以及逐步渗透nft的结合场景，中长期还是会结合nft做更多的深入场景；在内容生产方面，前期以平台PGC为主，中期逐渐为用户提供DIY功能往UGC发展 - 这也是元宇宙产品的必经之路试错成本低，可以投入有限的资金验证需求。\n\n所有的互联网产品都是从很小的产品去验证，验证完后，它会长大。如果它能创造很强的体验、具有强社交性强、传播性，可能瞬间会从10万用户膨胀到1000万用户。映客直播当年也从刚开始几个月没有人直播，只有三五个人，到突然一夜之间变成几十万人直播，然后变成全社交事件。所谓的社交产品它都是一个强爆发力，核心本质是能否真正做出强用户体验、强口碑、强传播的产品。\n\n对于营收和预算来说，这是一个动态尝试的过程，元宇宙是一个更新的项目，核心的判断会依据数据变化做决策。可能在三五年之后它会到达爆发点，但在这前几年是要有有积累有沉淀的。\n\n坦白来讲，目前还很初期，我们从0-1，相当于元宇宙的创业公司。看产品究竟多有影响力，还是要等它真正发布的时候，从用户体验来看，有可能它是成功的，也有可能是失败的，这都是正常状态，核心的还是要在大的方向下，做出正确选择和资源投入，在元宇宙趋势下，我们未来会有越来越多的产品去呈现和发布，也有信心和能力把这些产品做出符合商业逻辑的生态。\n\n预算：分阶段来看，初期在产品验证阶段低成本快速迭代，打磨产品体验优化产品数据，同时探索商业模式；产品验证+商业闭环验证完毕，可无上限投入。\n\n备份计划：xx用户 + xx场景 + xx社交需求，针对这3个维度做排列组合，比如我们初期是针对 欧美用户 + 实时互动场景  + 陌生社交需求。\n\n补充说明一下映客在整体元宇宙层面上的投入，元宇宙对技术挑战还挺大的，包括虚拟人、虚拟场景，从企业管理方面，会根据当下时机、发展的情况去投入，如果投入会让护城河越扎越深、经济模型完全闭环，也可以是无上限的投入。如果投入是死胡同，肯定不会了。\n\n我们有自己的技术和资源，也会和第三方合作，生态的分工和合作很明确。没有必要每一个轮子自己制作，重要的是能把外面所有的模块组件组合起来去做创新，像苹果也并不是每个部件都自制发明而创造，它重要的是组合创新。\n\n现在短时间内元宇宙的比拼和竞争的要点不在技术，技术的基础设施并不算元宇宙真正的基础设施，目前国内外的公司都没有搭建起来，元宇宙真正的大规模发展，必须等到顶级硬件终端的发布才会对行业产生颠覆性的影响。映客做的是应用层面的创新。映宇宙是由一个一个产品代表的小宇宙共同构成的。\n\n## 第二部分:里程碑项目YING的内容解读\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pY8G6jatAxfYPP3b_uEs.gif?height=750&width=750)\n\n### 1.我们进入第二部分，里程碑项目YING的内容解读。之前在Mirror上发了一篇文章哈，YING-超越之路\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU](https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU)\n\n### 现在给大家详细介绍一下YING的定位：\n\n映映-YING，映宇宙生态型企业形象IP，映宇宙的数字代言人。在产品形态上：映映将在映宇宙中有着不同的身份以及多重任务，我们会看到映映经常出现在积目、超级喜欢、映客直播、情侣星球、原原世界、The Place等社交星球中。\n\n在视觉呈现上：她有四种身份：元宇宙映映，运动达人映映，潮人映映，游戏NPC映映，之后大家也会在制作的NFT系列里发现他们的不同。\n\n在品牌发展的角度：未来，映宇宙将和更多知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌，进行服装、配饰设计。映映（YING NFT ) + 虚拟时尚NFT，能够让IP触达到真正的用户群体和粉丝，也能够帮助映宇宙将线下用户带到线上，让每一个社区用户可以参与到IP运营和共创中，共建映宇宙的Web3新生态。\n\n在社区方面：每一位持有者都将与映映的IP深度绑定，包括品牌合作、NFT系列相关产品等权益。品牌系统形成后，项目合作奖励和社区收益将基于链上记录的贡献。数据将透明的分发给社区成员。\n\n### 2.YING系列为什么定为了7777这个数量？\n\n首先是代表7周年。INKEPASS的1111和Hootbirds的1111，加起来正好是9999，这个也是主流NFT项目的一个体量。另外，在NFT的制作上，我们也有跟数字相关的彩蛋，大家可以关注一下。后面会有很多有意思的玩儿法，这些数字也是跟映客的开始和成长都息息相关的。\n\n### 3.YING是以品牌的角度去发展，这方面有哪些规划可以提前透露的吗？\n\n是的，映映路线图的中心是通过YING链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n有几个部分吧，首先，大背景是映宇宙已经准备好了：\n\n1. 映宇宙会为用户提供更实时的、更同步的、更沉浸式的体验，从2D到3D，从手机到AR/VR，让我们疯狂的想象，借助 AR/VR在映宇宙里进行虚拟社交！\n2. 映宇宙的内容生态由平台和用户共建，除了PGC还有UGC甚至AIGC，我们将为用户提供便捷的创作工具，一起打造丰富的映宇宙内容生态！\n3. 映宇宙会由多个社交元宇宙平台矩阵组成，映映会以映宇宙企业形象IP和数字代言人出现在映宇宙的各个社交元宇宙平台！\n\n**第二方面是生态的共建：**\n\n1. 映宇宙的建立和拓展，需要优秀的人才和团队，HootLabs除了自己的产品研发之外，我们也在持续寻找与我们有共同愿景的最优秀的人才和项目，目前有找我们的一些NFT的数据工具，一些创作者工具等。我们会觉得最有生命力最有意思的创意一定来源于社区，因为社区是最了解项目的人，也是深度参与的人，所以有web3赛道投融资方面的holder优先联系我，之后大家可以加我discord一起探讨；\n2. 映宇宙将与Hoot Labs社区一起探讨和策划，将映映以更合适且有效的方式引入web3.0并拓展影响力，大家可以投票参与一些组织决策，一起建议建设品牌的全面发展。\n\n**第三方面上品牌建设：**\n\n映映是一个来源于web3，走入web2的形象，链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n\n1\\.持续打造和提升映映在社交媒体影响力，策划内容、服装、场景，完善内容储备；\n\n2\\.以异业合作为主，通过品牌联动、平台联动、艺人联动等增加映映曝光及影响力；\n\n3\\.与各平台相关领域运营建立合作关系，获得流量支持及参与平台活动，拓展商业空间；\n\n4\\.与知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌；\n\n5\\.打造有影响力的直播事件，回馈粉丝及用户；\n\n6\\.策划后续商业合作及广告、代言及周边制作。\n\n让一个nft系列 一个IP更有价值 对于我们来说不是制作更多的nft，而是让这个IP不断的出圈，经营以及合作。我们应该应该相信作为映宇宙的代言人，映映在这方面将有无限的潜力。\n\n**第四方面，制作中的隐藏彩蛋**\n\n隐藏彩蛋会在Twitter和Discord公布，请大家及时关注公告信息。\n\n**第五方面，更多的线下活动**\n\n1\\.带着映映和Hoot Labs社区用户走进映宇宙的线下社交空间，包括但不限于超级喜欢线下体验店，积目酒吧线下体验店；\n\n2\\.与多家线下商业空间建立合作关系，定期举办映映粉丝线下活动见面会；\n\n3\\.积极参加web3.0行业峰会以及相关NFT展会，持续增加Hoot Labs和映映的曝光度和影响力。\n\n## 第三部分：自由问答\n\n### Q:为什么能吸引用户用place？Place的哪些功能是web2的app解决不了的？\n\nA:传统的2D社交、交友方式更多是在解决人机交互和信息分发的问题，互动的双方通过信息和内容的交换达成匹配关系，用户本身对于自身的操控感和所属感不强。而真实的线下交友和社交方式更自然，更强调“实时反馈”，3D结合音视频互动会让用户能够更有身临其境的感觉，最大程度上还远了线下的及时反馈和对自我及环境的掌控感。\n\n相比web2，Place引入了NFT作为核心的社交元素，NFT是在web3世界里的是互通的，是属于用户自己的数字资产，NFT代表了用户的圈层、标签、审美、资产，在Place里对用户的Profile是很有力的补充，同时NFT可自动标记人群分类，让各个项目的家人们更容易找到彼此，NFT在place里为用户提供更好更便捷的社交。\n\n### Q:目标用户是谁，具备什么特征？通过什么渠道和方法吸引和触达这批人？\n\nA:目标用户为对于游戏和社交界限感相对不那么敏感的z时代群体，这部分群体对于新产品和新形态持开放态度，传统的社交产品已经无法满足这类用户对于强互动、多元性、即使反馈等的诉求。前期用户群主打欧美市场，中后期会逐渐铺开到全球其他地区。\n\nWeb2方式：通过目标群里接受度较高的社交媒体对产品进行曝光和营销、同时结合产品功能和特定场景生成一些可分享、邀请的场景进行产品内的裂变；web3方式：与web3项目方进行市场合作，以项目入驻的方式进行用户群拓展\n\n### Q：有哪些线下场景的规划吗？例如开店\n\nA：整个映宇宙就是做先上线下的产品矩阵，超级喜欢 积目 都会有线下的体验店和多家合作的商业空间，也会跟艺术家合作，推出我们的吃服装和潮流线下的店，关于线下店是我们可以轻松拿下的项目，可谓势在必得到时也会定期举办一些holder的线下活动。\n\n### Q：INKEPASS在公司的定位？INKEPASS前期宣传不多，关于YING的赋能规划？\n\nA：我们也会分析每个NFT的定位和长期发展路线，INKEPASS 是结合web3 和其他项目的钥匙，在INKEPASS 前期的一些活动比较少，我们的重心放在了Hootbirds和YING的制作上， YING后期会加强活动，投入的资源和精力都会更多，希望用户给我们一些时间，看到我们的决心和改变，因为品牌升级，品牌形象也从猫头鹰升级为YING，因为我们有30天退款保障，代表映客7周年，价格上不会表现太差，YING最有可能打造为蓝筹的项目\n\n### Q：何时能使用到The Place？\n\nA：The place将会在8月上线", "timestamp": 1658029506, "digest": "bDA2XAcIDM2xrJq5_v5LDpsU8ZxvOn7_5hW99U7F3lw", "contributor": "0x8c41dDc92dFf79746F8D7Ba8B2af8031a60911FF"}

It relates to one of my main beliefs I have about web3. We will have casual users who don’t know they are using crypto and then you will have the superusers, aka us all.\n\nThe people interacting with smart contracts and weeding through all these horrible free mints is no different than setting up your own network with dialup back in the day. Scavenging torrent websites for software keys and shortcuts on the internet.\n\nIf you are a superuser, find ways to build with the people around you, find ways to make the space better. If any of us wants to see the value of our bags increase it takes hours on top of hours of work and brain power to build better products.\n\nLastly, let's remember that the goal of crypto is to be your own bank. Be in full control of your assets and not let others take your crypto. Get your keys off centralized exchanges and put them into a hardware wallet yesterday.\n\nEnjoy the ride everyone! Next 10 years are going to be wild. See you on the otherside.\n\n## Phibacka31 Thoughts\n\n**HEALTH IN WEB3** - This week was an actual blur. A lot of that had to do with a weird wrist flair up I had that began during the Graveyard Shift last week. To be honest, it was a much needed wakeup call. Health is something that gets overlooked time and time again within the space and it was having a direct negative impact on my life. This past week has had me focus in much more on the simple things: Exercise, proper hydration, and cutting out most sugar. These things may seem easy, but when you’ve been conditioned by bad habits to ignore these important factors it catches up to you. I’ve felt different this week, but it is a great start to a new me.\n\n**BORED TV**- As I stated last week I have begun a journey of talking more Bored Ape with a few fellow apes: [BRYTE](https://twitter.com/BRYTE_A) & [A-Raving-Ape](https://twitter.com/ape3593)\nIt has been a blast to have a few streams and get to talk more about the ecosystem as a whole and really peel back some layers on the Otherdeeds. The key here is to drive exploration and intrigue to the Otherside as we all build together. We will be interviewing holders and builders within Web3 with a focus on the metaverse and more specifically the Otherside. I hope you join in on the ride.\n\n**MEMBERSHIP NFTs** - We’ve talked about this a number of times on the Graveyard Shift and it has been on my mind once again: How badass are membership NFTs? I mean think about it. You can tie real life Web2 type companies with a Web3 type membership that can last forever. I love the idea of creating and building a collective community that gets to enjoy some real life utility however that may be. Shoutout to Rebud and what they are doing with marijuana ordering and distribution as they continue to expand. It also made me think about an NFT that came out a year ago that I was interviewed for.\nThe basis of this NFT was a Beer For Life token that could be purchased by patrons of the Denver Beer Co. It sold, via auction, for 4.33 ETH, which at the time was $9,200. I truly believe this is a play that will continue to expand as more and more companies dip their toes into the space to create this Web3 family. Read more here: Beer For Life\n\n**OTHERSIDE FIRST TRIP**- OMG. I mean honestly it blew me away. I realize that some of this was reskinning game that they have been building for some time, but my goodness. I was not expecting so much to do on the very first trip. I am already looking forward to the amazing things that we will be able to take part in as the Otherside develops. I can guarantee you that people would much rather go to the Otherside than sit in discord all day talking. I’ve also got my eyes peeled for that first concert in the Otherside. I truly cannot wait to see what’s next.\n\n## Dontfeedwolfeth Thoughts\n\n**Thoughts while Traveling**\n\nI used to be a big proponent of Education in this space. Although it’s important, there are other things that need to be addressed before we throw the bulk of the burden on the user and demand they DYOR.\n\nTake flying for instance. There is a lot we don’t need to know in order to board a plane for travel. There is some light onboarding, extra assistance available (when needed), but other parts we often ignore. Very few read the booklets in front of the seats or pay attention to the droning of the stewardess on safety before take-off. That information only becomes relevant when the plane crashes.\n\nOperating a crypto wallet and using it to seamlessly sign into and access websites and dapps, without memorizing multiple logins and passwords, should be something a child and your grandmother can do. The day-to-day operations should be easy to navigate, not easy to compromise. If we crashed our planes as often as wallets and users were compromised we would still be using boats and automobiles.\n\n**Shout-Out this Week**\n\nGamestop Marketplace is something to take notice of. Educational materials, their own wallet, as well as allowing for metamask etc. Integration into not just twitter, but also Reddit (which addressed a key target audience: r/Wallstreetbets). Utilizing Layer 2s and making transactions cost no more than .21 cents USD. I was able to purchase a couple $4 comics and each one was about .18-.20 cents USD in gas.\n\nOtherside First Trip was incredible. “The King’s Alpha” as the cool kids would say, was the litepaper drop they snuck out after it finished. <https://otherside.xyz/litepaper#the-agora>\n\nHonestly take notes of the way in which they demo and tested things. Creating a scripted interactive experience with good voice work, that made it fun while experiencing Otherside. I have full confidence in Yuga and Improbable to deliver what they are seeking out to build and it’s just a matter of time.\n\nLastly I want to shout out VaynerX’s offshoot VaynerNFT which rebranded to Vayner3 this week. I am biased on the rebrand and what they are doing, as I’m honored to be part of the experience and have an incredible leadership team guiding us like Avery:\n\n[https://twitter.com/YahooFinance/status/1548046031434043396?s=20&t=nYbX9bRkm6-f-EXUce5lDQ](https://twitter.com/YahooFinance/status/1548046031434043396?s=20&t=nYbX9bRkm6-f-EXUce5lDQ)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658029537, "digest": "B3Xx4OC1r_RUS-w87ntFUOBSkCrORt5qLPI92nzTUnk", "contributor": "0xF906BEB6E392cD0B8682F9229748b5A45fD61375"}

{"id": "vS1tb0fjYEJI0oU7LMrO61DXtbPi2JLlzggS-uNoJuA", "title": "7月16日 YING Talk VOL1 内容回顾", "body": "### 本次AMA将有三部分内容：\n\n### 第一部分：HootLabs社区用户问题回顾\n\n### 第二部分：里程碑项目YING的内容解读\n\n### 第三部分：自由问答\n\n## 第一部分：HootLabs社区用户问题回顾\n\n### 1.映客进入web3的主线是什么？\n\n今年我们公司的战略方向调整为元宇宙，并且在6.15号进行了公司品牌升级 - 由映客升级为映宇宙，这也凸显了我们进军元宇宙的决心。\n\n去年21年我们就在研究元宇宙，关于元宇宙的定义和描述有很多，截止目前元宇宙仍然没有清晰且唯一的定义，我们研究下来总结了行业对元宇宙的概念有以下4点的共识：\n\n1）元宇宙会给用户提供更实时的、更INKEPASS 是映客元宇宙的mintpass和核心权益通证，是开启映客元宇宙奇妙之旅的钥匙。在未来用户将通过这把钥匙逐步解锁Inke在web3的布局；\n\nINKEPASS 将铸造在以太链上。数量：1111枚，1000枚用于公开销售，111枚团队自留。价格为 0.1eth同步的、更沉浸式的体验，更多是从移动端2D到3D，以及从手机设备到AR/VR可穿戴设备；\n\n2）元宇宙里面的内容生态是由平台和用户共建，除了PGC还有UGC甚至AIGC，需要提供便捷的创作者工具；\n\n3）元宇宙平台里面生产的内容、数据、资产应该属于用户本身，不应该因平台某一天关掉，用户数据也丢失了；\n\n4）元宇宙里面需要有一套完备的经济体系，用户可能在元宇宙里面有一份可观的收入，或者能够取代用户在真实物理世界里的工作。\n\n结合以上4点认知，我们在元宇宙布局分了两个大的方向，一个方向是体验层面的，也就是1和2，将产品体验从2D升级到3D，并且探索AR/VR下一代智能设备；另一个方向是数据和资产层面的，也就是3和4，这也是web3的范畴。\n\n所以，进入web3大前提是我们公司要进军元宇宙，结合我们对元宇宙的认知我们除了在体验层面做战略布局之外，也需要在数据和资产层面也就是web3方向做战略布局，这是我们进入web3的主线。\n\n### 2.认为进入web3的成功标志是什么？\n\n在web3方面我们还处于相对早期的阶段，除了研究行业里的优质项目，调研各个赛道可能存在的机会，我们也在做web3项目的孵化和投资，想要从各个维度完善上面提到的几方面的布局。\n\n我们认为一个项目的成功标志是：通过提供产品和服务，解决了用户的需求和痛点，为用户提供实用的产品价值 - 这和是否与web3无关，所有成功的产品都应该具备这个特点。\n\n这个也是健康的项目能吸引用户留存的关键，真实的应用场景，跟生活方式息息相关，健康完善的经济体系。我觉得对于用户体验，用户层面的互动娱乐、社交需求挖掘和产品塑造是映客的强项，和写在基因里的优势。产品端的优势带入到web3里，会有更多的可能性。\n\n### 3.在集团层面，想把web3做成什么规模？投入人力物力如何？\n\n我们公司的优势是做互动娱乐和社交，所以我们更希望在社交方向做布局，社交产品的天花板和想象空间比较高，所以做成会有很大的用户规模\n\n核心业务团队20人左右；除此之外，元宇宙中后台团队上百人为业务团队提供支撑；与此同时战投部门会做战略布局。\n\n### 4.项目方如何对INKEPASS做更好的价值支撑，或者在哪些方面让pass的价值更高一些？\n\n我们认为INKEPASS的价值，是与HootLabs社区建设和发展是强相关的。我们会在社区方面持续进行建设：\n\n1、市场方面：与更多项目方建立合作，拓宽HootLabs社区用户覆盖面，为社区用户争取其他项目的各种权益和利益；\n\n2、运营方面：丰富社区玩法，推出NFT质押和积分商城，加强社群线上活动，并启动线下活动的组织；\n\n3、项目方面：随着HootLabs web3项目落地，例如The Place，给予HootLabs NFT Holders持续的空投和权益赋能；\n\n4、社区方面：我们会在合适的时间节点，把HootLabs版税收入的一部分，拿出来反馈给社区，让家人与项目方一起来共建HootLabs社区。\n\n### 5.HootLabs的roadmap回顾\n\n2022\\.6发行权益通证，品牌升级，全面布局映客元宇宙生态，打造矩阵化社交产品；发布映客纪念版NFT；社区中建立collab giveaway频道，给用户福利；\n\n2022\\.7发布里程碑式NFT项目; 发布积分质押计划；\n\nQ3发布INKE社交型产品The Place，赋能INKEPASS的持有者，建造映客元宇宙的第一颗社交星球；\n\nQ4发布The Place 2.0版，升级社交功能，添加活动功能。\n\n### 6.The Place到底要做什么？作为一款APP，在web3里怎么串联起这些NFT的项目？\n\nThe Place是一个线上虚拟现实的社交产品，我们希望通过将线下的社交互动行为通过3D的方式进行还原，打造一个多元场景，富有沉浸体验的社交互动平台。 Place同时兼容web2和web3，web3里的NFT是Place里社交的核心元素。\n\n### 7.The Place成功的阶段性目标有哪些？投入多少预算去实现？如果阶段性目标没有实现有什么备份计划？\n\nThe Place短期目标在于打造场景和完善用户体验为目标，以及逐步渗透nft的结合场景，中长期还是会结合nft做更多的深入场景；在内容生产方面，前期以平台PGC为主，中期逐渐为用户提供DIY功能往UGC发展 - 这也是元宇宙产品的必经之路试错成本低，可以投入有限的资金验证需求。\n\n所有的互联网产品都是从很小的产品去验证，验证完后，它会长大。如果它能创造很强的体验、具有强社交性强、传播性，可能瞬间会从10万用户膨胀到1000万用户。映客直播当年也从刚开始几个月没有人直播，只有三五个人，到突然一夜之间变成几十万人直播，然后变成全社交事件。所谓的社交产品它都是一个强爆发力，核心本质是能否真正做出强用户体验、强口碑、强传播的产品。\n\n对于营收和预算来说，这是一个动态尝试的过程，元宇宙是一个更新的项目，核心的判断会依据数据变化做决策。可能在三五年之后它会到达爆发点，但在这前几年是要有有积累有沉淀的。\n\n坦白来讲，目前还很初期，我们从0-1，相当于元宇宙的创业公司。看产品究竟多有影响力，还是要等它真正发布的时候，从用户体验来看，有可能它是成功的，也有可能是失败的，这都是正常状态，核心的还是要在大的方向下，做出正确选择和资源投入，在元宇宙趋势下，我们未来会有越来越多的产品去呈现和发布，也有信心和能力把这些产品做出符合商业逻辑的生态。\n\n预算：分阶段来看，初期在产品验证阶段低成本快速迭代，打磨产品体验优化产品数据，同时探索商业模式；产品验证+商业闭环验证完毕，可无上限投入。\n\n备份计划：xx用户 + xx场景 + xx社交需求，针对这3个维度做排列组合，比如我们初期是针对 欧美用户 + 实时互动场景  + 陌生社交需求。\n\n补充说明一下映客在整体元宇宙层面上的投入，元宇宙对技术挑战还挺大的，包括虚拟人、虚拟场景，从企业管理方面，会根据当下时机、发展的情况去投入，如果投入会让护城河越扎越深、经济模型完全闭环，也可以是无上限的投入。如果投入是死胡同，肯定不会了。\n\n我们有自己的技术和资源，也会和第三方合作，生态的分工和合作很明确。没有必要每一个轮子自己制作，重要的是能把外面所有的模块组件组合起来去做创新，像苹果也并不是每个部件都自制发明而创造，它重要的是组合创新。\n\n现在短时间内元宇宙的比拼和竞争的要点不在技术，技术的基础设施并不算元宇宙真正的基础设施，目前国内外的公司都没有搭建起来，元宇宙真正的大规模发展，必须等到顶级硬件终端的发布才会对行业产生颠覆性的影响。映客做的是应用层面的创新。映宇宙是由一个一个产品代表的小宇宙共同构成的。\n\n## 第二部分:里程碑项目YING的内容解读\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pY8G6jatAxfYPP3b_uEs.gif?height=750&width=750)\n\n### 1.我们进入第二部分，里程碑项目YING的内容解读。之前在Mirror上发了一篇文章哈，YING-超越之路\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU](https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU)\n\n### 现在给大家详细介绍一下YING的定位：\n\n映映-YING，映宇宙生态型企业形象IP，映宇宙的数字代言人。在产品形态上：映映将在映宇宙中有着不同的身份以及多重任务，我们会看到映映经常出现在积目、超级喜欢、映客直播、情侣星球、原原世界、The Place等社交星球中。\n\n在视觉呈现上：她有四种身份：元宇宙映映，运动达人映映，潮人映映，游戏NPC映映，之后大家也会在制作的NFT系列里发现他们的不同。\n\n在品牌发展的角度：未来，映宇宙将和更多知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌，进行服装、配饰设计。映映（YING NFT ) + 虚拟时尚NFT，能够让IP触达到真正的用户群体和粉丝，也能够帮助映宇宙将线下用户带到线上，让每一个社区用户可以参与到IP运营和共创中，共建映宇宙的Web3新生态。\n\n在社区方面：每一位持有者都将与映映的IP深度绑定，包括品牌合作、NFT系列相关产品等权益。品牌系统形成后，项目合作奖励和社区收益将基于链上记录的贡献。数据将透明的分发给社区成员。\n\n### 2.YING系列为什么定为了7777这个数量？\n\n首先是代表7周年。INKEPASS的1111和Hootbirds的1111，加起来正好是9999，这个也是主流NFT项目的一个体量。另外，在NFT的制作上，我们也有跟数字相关的彩蛋，大家可以关注一下。后面会有很多有意思的玩儿法，这些数字也是跟映客的开始和成长都息息相关的。\n\n### 3.YING是以品牌的角度去发展，这方面有哪些规划可以提前透露的吗？\n\n是的，映映路线图的中心是通过YING链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n有几个部分吧，首先，大背景是映宇宙已经准备好了：\n\n1. 映宇宙会为用户提供更实时的、更同步的、更沉浸式的体验，从2D到3D，从手机到AR/VR，让我们疯狂的想象，借助 AR/VR在映宇宙里进行虚拟社交！\n2. 映宇宙的内容生态由平台和用户共建，除了PGC还有UGC甚至AIGC，我们将为用户提供便捷的创作工具，一起打造丰富的映宇宙内容生态！\n3. 映宇宙会由多个社交元宇宙平台矩阵组成，映映会以映宇宙企业形象IP和数字代言人出现在映宇宙的各个社交元宇宙平台！\n\n**第二方面是生态的共建：**\n\n1. 映宇宙的建立和拓展，需要优秀的人才和团队，HootLabs除了自己的产品研发之外，我们也在持续寻找与我们有共同愿景的最优秀的人才和项目，目前有找我们的一些NFT的数据工具，一些创作者工具等。我们会觉得最有生命力最有意思的创意一定来源于社区，因为社区是最了解项目的人，也是深度参与的人，所以有web3赛道投融资方面的holder优先联系我，之后大家可以加我discord一起探讨；\n2. 映宇宙将与HootLabs社区一起探讨和策划，将映映以更合适且有效的方式引入web3.0并拓展影响力，大家可以投票参与一些组织决策，一起建议建设品牌的全面发展。\n\n**第三方面上品牌建设：**\n\n映映是一个来源于web3，走入web2的形象，链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n\n1\\.持续打造和提升映映在社交媒体影响力，策划内容、服装、场景，完善内容储备；\n\n2\\.以异业合作为主，通过品牌联动、平台联动、艺人联动等增加映映曝光及影响力；\n\n3\\.与各平台相关领域运营建立合作关系，获得流量支持及参与平台活动，拓展商业空间；\n\n4\\.与知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌；\n\n5\\.打造有影响力的直播事件，回馈粉丝及用户；\n\n6\\.策划后续商业合作及广告、代言及周边制作。\n\n让一个nft系列 一个IP更有价值 对于我们来说不是制作更多的nft，而是让这个IP不断的出圈，经营以及合作。我们应该应该相信作为映宇宙的代言人，映映在这方面将有无限的潜力。\n\n**第四方面，制作中的隐藏彩蛋**\n\n隐藏彩蛋会在Twitter和Discord公布，请大家及时关注公告信息。\n\n**第五方面，更多的线下活动**\n\n1\\.带着映映和HootLabs社区用户走进映宇宙的线下社交空间，包括但不限于超级喜欢线下体验店，积目酒吧线下体验店；\n\n2\\.与多家线下商业空间建立合作关系，定期举办映映粉丝线下活动见面会；\n\n3\\.积极参加web3.0行业峰会以及相关NFT展会，持续增加HootLabs和映映的曝光度和影响力。\n\n## 第三部分：自由问答\n\n### Q:为什么能吸引用户用place？Place的哪些功能是web2的app解决不了的？\n\nA:传统的2D社交、交友方式更多是在解决人机交互和信息分发的问题，互动的双方通过信息和内容的交换达成匹配关系，用户本身对于自身的操控感和所属感不强。而真实的线下交友和社交方式更自然，更强调“实时反馈”，3D结合音视频互动会让用户能够更有身临其境的感觉，最大程度上还远了线下的及时反馈和对自我及环境的掌控感。\n\n相比web2，Place引入了NFT作为核心的社交元素，NFT是在web3世界里的是互通的，是属于用户自己的数字资产，NFT代表了用户的圈层、标签、审美、资产，在Place里对用户的Profile是很有力的补充，同时NFT可自动标记人群分类，让各个项目的家人们更容易找到彼此，NFT在place里为用户提供更好更便捷的社交。\n\n### Q:目标用户是谁，具备什么特征？通过什么渠道和方法吸引和触达这批人？\n\nA:目标用户为对于游戏和社交界限感相对不那么敏感的z时代群体，这部分群体对于新产品和新形态持开放态度，传统的社交产品已经无法满足这类用户对于强互动、多元性、即使反馈等的诉求。前期用户群主打欧美市场，中后期会逐渐铺开到全球其他地区。\n\nWeb2方式：通过目标群里接受度较高的社交媒体对产品进行曝光和营销、同时结合产品功能和特定场景生成一些可分享、邀请的场景进行产品内的裂变；web3方式：与web3项目方进行市场合作，以项目入驻的方式进行用户群拓展\n\n### Q：有哪些线下场景的规划吗？例如开店\n\nA：整个映宇宙就是做先上线下的产品矩阵，超级喜欢 积目 都会有线下的体验店和多家合作的商业空间，也会跟艺术家合作，推出我们的吃服装和潮流线下的店，关于线下店是我们可以轻松拿下的项目，可谓势在必得到时也会定期举办一些holder的线下活动。\n\n### Q：INKEPASS在公司的定位？INKEPASS前期宣传不多，关于YING的赋能规划？\n\nA：我们也会分析每个NFT的定位和长期发展路线，INKEPASS 是结合web3 和其他项目的钥匙，在INKEPASS 前期的一些活动比较少，我们的重心放在了Hootbirds和YING的制作上， YING后期会加强活动，投入的资源和精力都会更多，希望用户给我们一些时间，看到我们的决心和改变，因为品牌升级，品牌形象也从猫头鹰升级为YING，因为我们有30天退款保障，代表映客7周年，价格上不会表现太差，YING最有可能打造为蓝筹的项目\n\n### Q：何时能使用到The Place？\n\nA：The Place将会在8月上线", "timestamp": 1658029784, "digest": "Vmpm84MfppDQq-SZbmkD5X171JafQbGi08bh5Phg3Fg", "contributor": "0x8c41dDc92dFf79746F8D7Ba8B2af8031a60911FF"}

{"id": "usofr3OvsQf4iNNN2BaiQsB1Dcxjy_u1rijxVW20OG4", "title": "面对开发者的NFT手册（理论篇）", "body": "## 什么是NFT\n\nNFT(non-fungible token) 即非同质化代币，现在普遍意义上来讲是指不可分割、具有独特性、基于区块链技术确保所有权的虚拟资产。\n\n这是一个非常极客的命名方式，往往让人摸不着头脑，其实这一概念早已有之，例如游戏中的装备、虚拟艺术品、线上票据、域名等等都是非同质化的虚拟资产。与之相对的同质化代币，最好的例子就是银行账户里面的存款，我账户中的100元跟你账户中的100元是完全等价、同质的。\n\n真正让NFT在近些年大火的原因其实是因为区块链技术的发展，历史上第一次虚拟资产的所有权完完全全掌握在了持有者手中。想象一下，你再也不需要担心由于游戏运营商的问题而失去账户中的所有装备，因为平台的倒闭而丢掉购买过的照片和音乐。\n\n### 标准化\n\nWEB2中的数字资产是各自为战的，支付宝中的勋章和票据是无法在微信中使用的。\n\nNFT构建于公链（以太坊、Solana等），开发者基于统一的标准（ERC721、ERC1155等）进行部署，使得NFT具有通用性、可复用、可继承的特点。\n\n### 可交互性\n\n标准化的NFT一旦部署，即打通了钱包（MetaMask、Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect等），交易市场（OpenSea、X2Y2、LooksRare等）和其他数据聚合器（Nasen、ICY、NFTGo等）。\n\n### 交易便利\n\nNFT所有者可以零成本的在交易市场进行挂单交易，目前交易市场已经支持一键挂单/出价、批量挂单/出价、荷兰拍等功能。\n\n当然，交易市场会在交易成功后收取一定的手续费用，一般在0.5%-2.5%之间。\n\n### 对创作者的激励\n\n基于区块链透明、不可篡改的特性，创作者可以非常容易的证明自己的创作，NFT产品知识产权天然的得到保护。\n\n同时每次交易的版税设定大大增加了创作者的收入。\n\n##

The bed is wrapped in flower-patterned sheets. The room is vaguely lit by my iPhone charging in the corner. Creeping out of bed, I hear Leah waking up. She turns over onto her back. I feel the floor's wooden grain on my bare feet as I lumber over to my pile of clothes.\n\n\"You're…awake?\" Leah asks, groggily. I pull my pants up. \"Where you going?\"\n\n\"I can't sleep.\"\n\n\"Try praying,\" she says. \"That always…helps me.\"\n\nButtoning down my top, I stare at her peaceful face, her lips slightly parting into a smile.\n\n\"What do you say when you pray,\" I ask her, curious.\n\n\"I say…thank you for this and that, mostly.\"\n\n\"Does he ever say anything back?\" I say, sarcastically, but without malice.\n\n\"Of course he does…in everything…in the sun rising and setting every day, in the people we meet...” Leah closes her eyes and her voice trails off. I disconnect my iPhone and see that it's 3:13am.\n\n\"Okay,\" I say. \"I'll give prayer a try.\"\n\nShe turns over to her side to face me, beaming.\n\n\"Go to sleep, sweetheart,\" I stroke her hair as she drifts off.\n\nIn the living room, the drapes of the large window are pulled wide open, letting in a faint glow from the starlit sky outside. My eyes adjust quickly. I see the outline of the table where two flashlights stand upright. I grab one of them.\n\nThe screen door creaks open, followed by more creaks from the wooden planks on the old porch. I grope my way down the staircase to the dirt ground below, continuing on down the hillside towards the lake. I shine the flashlight on the earth before taking each step, making sure the ground is even there. A wind blows dry dirt and I clench my eyes shut. The night is void of cricket chirps and mosquitoes buzzing in my ears—there is only the relentless rushing of wind.\n\nAs I descend the slope, the sound of waves smacking against wood gets closer. At the foot of the hill, the ground levels out, and I find myself at the mouth of a boat deck floating in the water. Stepping onto the deck, it wobbles and I shift my weight side to side for balance. Ahead of me, the stars reflect off the lake like wavering white dots. I turn off the flashlight and see my own body vanish in the blackness, as if I'm just a pair of eyes hovering over the lake, encompassed by stars above and stars below.\n\nI know that the stars are millions of miles away, its light taking thousands of years to reach my eyes, and I wonder if the actual galactic orbs of gas are even still up there at all—or are they ghosts now—remnants from another time, like the tweets and posts and artwork from people now dead.\n\nTurning back, I step off the unsteady deck onto solid ground, and I sit on a bench a few feet away from the water, resting under the hanging branches of a maple. The bench is like a miniature version of a city park bench, as if it was made for children, and perhaps it was, placed there by Dad decades ago for me. Compelled by the peacefulness, I try, in the darkness, to recall everything I knew before I had erased my childhood from my mind. I struggle to recall the faces of all my grade one classmates from shortest to tallest. Gradually, I remember a time when Dad carried Mom into their bedroom, both of them laughing hysterically, and once again, I come to possess what is already mine.\n\nLooking up at the stars again, I remember Leah telling me to pray, and I begin to search for Leah's God—there in the stars. But I only see the stars—unmoving in the sky for billions of years. So I look beyond the stars—behind them—and see them this time as God's words—written billions of years ago.\n\nIf Leah is right, then the stars, like the mountains and the oceans, are the true scripture of God. Everything is God's words. I think of the generations of men who have come to pass and I imagine the first morning of time when God began writing his message to me—a message traveling through millenniums to reach me here by the lake.\n\nBut what does the message say? What do His words mean? Perhaps the sum total of all stars is simply a single word. Or perhaps the message is not a word, but a single sound that inferred the entire universe. Here, standing alone under the stars, I pray—thankful for his words—this wind, this night sky, these stars, this body of mine.\n\nAnd I thank God for my emptiness—my vast, infinite and glorious emptiness. And suddenly, I feel as if the ground below and the sky above is replacing the prison of my small apartment, and the eternity and vastness of the universe is the new extension of my identity.\n\nAnd with this understanding, this bliss of understanding, I dig out the phone from my pocket and stare down at its lighted screen. My peripheral vision disappears and I only see the whiteness of the screen, almost blindingly, and nothing else. The tiny computer in my hand is a connection to another universe as singular and shared as the one I stood in. A metaverse—a dynamic book of infinite messages, endless identities, and inner dimensions. I tap the wallet icon and I’m asked for my secret recovery phrase. I stare at the twelve empty fields waiting to be filled. Twelve empty fields, like the twelve disciples of Jesus, the twelves sons of Jacob, the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve gates of heaven guarded by twelve angels.\n\nI enter the twelve words William challenged us to remember when we first met. And then I'm in.\n\nMy breath quickens. In the wallet is just a small fraction of Ethereum and all the NFTs I had written and minted without any memory of it.\n\nI open my document app and begin to type on the screen in a trance, as if writing in a vacuum, and the words spill onto the screen like olive oil. Then time skips, and the page is full of words—an hour may have passed, or a minute—it is impossible for me to tell. But it doesn't matter now—it’s over. The story of William is finished. I format the words to fit onto one page and take a screenshot. I connect William’s wallet to OpenSea and mint the final item. William is free now—free to exist forever—free from me.\n\nThe wind blows stronger, and waves slap the deck harder. After taking a deep breath, I light a cigarette, its amber tip glowing brighter as I inhale. Looking up at the cottage, I see a light in the window. Leah must be awake now, waiting for me. But then the light turns off, and the cottage turns into a black outline against the purplish sky. Beside the cottage on the west side is the dense forest that ate my childhood, swallowing it whole and imprisoning it there until yesterday. The forest is now just a forest—just a bunch of trees and a dead birch with a tiny cross nailed to its trunk.\n\nI think I hear something—voices from the cottage. I must be imagining it. A wind plunders through the trees and I curse at the noise, listening for the voices.\n\nI hear it again.\n\nI shake my head. It's late, and I must be hearing things, I convince myself. I clamber up the hillside, the cigarette hanging from my lips. Sucking in a final nervous drag, I drop the cigarette and crush it into the dirt with the heel of my boot. I exhale the sweet nicotine that fails to relax me as it usually does, and make my way back to the cottage.\n\nCreaking across the porch and into the cottage, something feels off.\n\n“Leah?” I switch on the lights and see our bedroom door open. Inside the room the bed is empty, the comforter on the floor. “Leah!” I call out louder. She’s not in the washroom either.\n\nMy mouth seems to dry up when I notice the front door agape, the cabinet door under the sink hanging open, and one of my Dad’s rifles missing from the rack.\n\nA voice screams outside in the distance.\n\nDashing out the front door, I point the flashlight to the west, but the light doesn’t hit anything—it disappears into the darkness between the trees.\n\nI trudge into the darkness to the west. Flustering, I swing the light from tree to tree. All sounds are heightened, like the crushing of foliage at my feet and the rustling leaves above. My fingers tighten around the flashlight and I jerk the light towards every sound. Trekking deeper, thick vines creep around me. Branches from twisted oaks hover like outstretched arms. An owl screeches overhead. Blood rushes between my ears.\n\nAnd then I see it—the dead birch. The wind expands, and the rustle of leaves becomes deafening. My flashlight beam stretches towards the tree and I see a figure standing beside it. At first glance, in the blurring darkness, I'm not sure who it is. Trembling, I drop the flashlight. It thumps on the damp ground, throwing me into darkness. Falling to my knees, I scramble for the light. I find it and raise it again, not daring to blink—it’s Leah, gripping a kerosene jug hanging heavy at her side, her face wet with tears.\n\n\"Hey fam,\" says a voice in the shadows.\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\nThere are only 3 posts remaining.\n\n3 posts that will reveal the truth.\n\nA truth hidden in plain sight.\n\n**Dropping here on 07.24.22**", "timestamp": 1658031511, "digest": "iG6VDUSkQ2FgMzqtGu9e_5u46f9fROrUikHBElM_HKE", "contributor": "0xB94FbeEc03C1c33899e2b22F28AaeeCF6026a7cD"}

Personal anonymous IPv4/IPv6 proxies / PROXY6.net](https://proxy6.net/en/d/357399)\n\n[Proxy service. Buy proxy, personal and anonymous. IPv4, IPv6 proxy. HTTPs, Socks5 proxy. Proxy for social networks](https://proxy6.net/en/d/357399)\n\n[proxy6.net](https://proxy6.net/en/d/357399)\n\nproxy6 我个人已经用了一年了，没啥问题，独享一个月1.77美元，共享0.59美元。\n\n这个价格是我找到里面最低的了，因为IP这个东西提供服务的服务商很多。\n\n大部分干几个月就跑了，所以大家包月买安全一些。\n\nproxy6 提供了非常多地区可以选择，数量也比较充足。\n\n## AdsPower 如何批量操作？\n\n这里我只推荐写代码，使用 Selenium 操作是最简单的方式，写一个脚本，让所有窗口去运行即可。\n\nSelenium 的教程大家可以去网上搜一搜。\n\n虽然 AdsPower 提供了RPA 可以写一些脚本，但是每次执行需要另付费，成本较高不推荐。\n\n还有网上有人提供同步器，就是同时打开几个窗口操作的工具。\n\n也不推荐，同步器同时打开操作的窗口数量上限看你的电脑配置，有时候你开了10个操作，可能中间有1个窗口掉队了，就非常麻烦。\n\n因为有数量限制，所以也不可能成百上千的去操作。\n\n还有一点，就是网上下载的同步器可能有病毒和木马，这一点尤为要小心，别被别人撸了毛。\n\n## AdsPower 如何批量装小狐狸钱包？\n\n其实AdsPower 批量安装浏览器插件，应该是点开“应用中心”进行安装。\n\n但是，这里需要注意，这种用第三方的安装方式不安全，可能这里面的小狐狸被人动过手脚。\n\n社区里面有位朋友一直怀疑钱包被盗跟应用中心的插件有关系，所以我们可以自己安装。\n\n打开小狐狸钱包的官方GitHub:\n\n[Releases · MetaMask/metamask-extension](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/releases)\n\n[:globe_with_meridians: :electric_plug: The MetaMask browser extension enables browsing Ethereum blockchain enabled websites - MetaMask/metamask-extension](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/releases)\n\n[github.com](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/releases)\n\n如下图所示，直接点击就可以下载插件包：\n\n然后我们来到AdsPower的应用中心，点击“上传应用”\n\n安装包选择刚才下载zip文件，名称随便写一下就可以了。\n\n这时候你打开指纹浏览器，就可以找到刚才安装的插件了！\n\n右下角这里记得打开！", "timestamp": 1658031678, "digest": "0jLu42kMd8noFVg8Euj0-2kwgUbCRTiWZrgGmr40c-o", "contributor": "0xaB3D502Bbc47D660b253ad99f5fEa161Aab6E985"}

But **Mirror** is quickly changing that. In this guide, we’re going to dive into **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** - **a web3 toolkit for sharing stories, funding ideas, and turning text-based content into NFTs** - and publish an entry on Mirror of our own!\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we begin, let’s make sure you have your gear in order. To mint an entry on Mirror, all you’ll need is an Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow.\n\n*If you need help getting set up, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w).** There, you’ll find a guide for **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)!***\n\n## NFTs & Mirror\n\nWhile today’s most popular NFTs are image-based, pictures are just a fraction of what NFTs are capable of. At their core, **NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are simply proofs of ownership written on a blockchain**. These proofs of ownership represent an asset, digital or physical, and link it to an individual's blockchain address. The result is a publicly verifiable file, showing a certain thing owned by a certain person.\n\nSo, can an article be an NFT? Absolutely!\n\nAt first glance, **Mirror** may just look like a web3 platform for publishing and monetizing articles — something like a blockchain-based Medium or Substack.

But **Mirror** is quickly changing that. In this guide, we’re going to dive into **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** - **a web3 toolkit for sharing stories, funding ideas, and turning text-based content into NFTs** - and publish an entry on Mirror of our own!\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we begin, let’s make sure you have your gear in order. To mint an entry on Mirror, all you’ll need is an Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow.\n\n*If you need help getting set up, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w).** There, you’ll find a guide for **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)!***\n\n## NFTs & Mirror\n\nWhile today’s most popular NFTs are image-based, pictures are just a fraction of what NFTs are capable of. At their core, **NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are simply proofs of ownership written on a blockchain**. These proofs of ownership represent an asset, digital or physical, and link it to an individual's blockchain address. The result is a publicly verifiable file, showing a certain thing owned by a certain person.\n\nSo, can an article be an NFT? Absolutely!\n\nAt first glance, **Mirror** may just look like a web3 platform for publishing and monetizing articles — something like a blockchain-based Medium or Substack. But under the hood, Mirror is a powerful tool for creating content and building communities. It gives you everything you need for minting NFTs, crowdfunding, splitting proceeds from sales, and even minting ERC20 tokens to distribute to new community members.\n\n**Today, we’re going to write our first Mirror articles and publish them as NFTs.

My goal was to see who is actively propelling the RTFKT/CloneX ecosystem **\\*beyond\\* what the core team was doing**…the results are astonishing.\n\nI’m pleased to present **Volume 1** **of the CloneX Ecosystem Map**, a collection of the builders who are propelling this community forward. This comes after weeks of studying, interacting and immersing myself within the CloneX community and I feel is pretty good representation of community at large. PLEASE if I left anyone out, I’d love to capture everyone who’s involved within the space, but there are a few criteria I put in place for categorization and filtering purposes:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nbyDU69gGOskYLoswcQd3.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n**1st:** You must use a CloneX as your PFP (a majority of the time)\n\n**2nd:** You must not be on the official RTFKT / Nike team (the idea here is to go beyond the core team)\n\n**3rd:** Your work needs to be directly contributing to the CloneX ecosystem (for instance, I wouldn’t count an artist who made a one off painting of a clone that someone requested to be commissioned as someone “building” for the community. That changes if said artist’s purpose for the account was to commission 1 of 1 paintings for Clones. In that case, of course they would be included here…and I welcome it!!)\n\n**Now let’s go into the categories:**\n\n**Artists: Digital or Physical**. Artists were an easy one to capture since there are so many, the hair splitting comes as I had to bifurcate between either digital or physical. I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive per se, but I needed some way to recognize [@AntbenBen](https://twitter.com/AntbenBen)’s amazing T-Shirt work and the factory that [@SwooshieNFT](https://twitter.com/SwooshieNFT) is building. For those reasons, I decided to make them 2 distinct categories. If course, if you’d like to be moved, LMK.\n\n**Music & Media:** these are the people like @VegaGenesisTM who are building at the intersection of music & their clone. This dude rigged a whole set up and had his clone spit bars on the track [linked here](https://twitter.com/VegaGenesisTM/status/1545098431059730434?s=20&t=jWHvWjCB3KAgwIXp9D8dcw).\n\n**News:** are those who are covering the community, thinking outside of the box and giving newcomers a way to immerse themselves into the space. If you’re interested in anything RTFKT but don’t know where to start, I highly recommend giving [@RTFKTcreators](https://twitter.com/RTFKTcreators) & [@clonespiracys](https://twitter.com/clonespiracys) a follow. If you have time, be sure to join into the Clonespiracy spaces every Monday at 5PM PST, they’re awesome.\n\n**Ecosystem Lore:** lots of really cool side projects and IP are being built out here. I feel like the CloneX brand gives way to a ton of different verticals to explore especially within anime, street and the fashion verticals. This is an area of community lead creation I’d love to see grow. Shoutout to [@CloneXRamenShop](https://twitter.com/CloneXRamenShop) & [@TastuAdjaye](https://twitter.com/TatsuAdjaye) on their pioneering work.\n\n**Adjacent Projects:** These are derivative projects that use elements from the base CloneX to either their own spin on it as in the case with the [@johnnyx_nft](https://twitter.com/johnnyx_nft) project or cross collabs as in the case with [@coolXclones](https://twitter.com/coolXclones). \n\nAll 6 of these subcategories make up the “**knitting**” of the RTFKT / CloneX Ecosystem that is so special to this community and truly only rivaled to that of BAYC - and that’s something that a lot of projects aspire to but struggle to attain over time. \n\nI hope there are a TON more additions to the list by the time Volume 2 comes out and we 100x this community lead effort by next year. I have a list in a Google Doc ([linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vzyiHX3IEHXOOaob-iFdwCPNu20Y2LY2u703zNu6-pQ/edit?usp=sharing)) which anyone can check out and comment to add themselves or anyone I missed.\n\n \n  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658032109, "digest": "DEijsz3utADE70lL__dkKc_sGPvP-vB_kcvdHiU8YP8", "contributor": "0x23bdEb4396BEB7e179c65A3FcA025EA2ABC156D5"}

发布积分质押计划；\n\nQ3发布INKE社交型产品The Place，赋能INKEPASS的持有者，建造映客元宇宙的第一颗社交星球；\n\nQ4发布The Place 2.0版，升级社交功能，添加活动功能。\n\n### 6.The Place到底要做什么？作为一款APP，在web3里怎么串联起这些NFT的项目？\n\nThe Place是一个线上虚拟现实的社交产品，我们希望通过将线下的社交互动行为通过3D的方式进行还原，打造一个多元场景，富有沉浸体验的社交互动平台。 Place同时兼容web2和web3，web3里的NFT是Place里社交的核心元素。\n\n### 7.The Place成功的阶段性目标有哪些？投入多少预算去实现？如果阶段性目标没有实现有什么备份计划？\n\nThe Place短期目标在于打造场景和完善用户体验为目标，以及逐步渗透nft的结合场景，中长期还是会结合nft做更多的深入场景；在内容生产方面，前期以平台PGC为主，中期逐渐为用户提供DIY功能往UGC发展 - 这也是元宇宙产品的必经之路试错成本低，可以投入有限的资金验证需求。\n\n所有的互联网产品都是从很小的产品去验证，验证完后，它会长大。如果它能创造很强的体验、具有强社交性强、传播性，可能瞬间会从10万用户膨胀到1000万用户。映客直播当年也从刚开始几个月没有人直播，只有三五个人，到突然一夜之间变成几十万人直播，然后变成全社交事件。所谓的社交产品它都是一个强爆发力，核心本质是能否真正做出强用户体验、强口碑、强传播的产品。\n\n对于营收和预算来说，这是一个动态尝试的过程，元宇宙是一个更新的项目，核心的判断会依据数据变化做决策。可能在三五年之后它会到达爆发点，但在这前几年是要有有积累有沉淀的。\n\n坦白来讲，目前还很初期，我们从0-1，相当于元宇宙的创业公司。看产品究竟多有影响力，还是要等它真正发布的时候，从用户体验来看，有可能它是成功的，也有可能是失败的，这都是正常状态，核心的还是要在大的方向下，做出正确选择和资源投入，在元宇宙趋势下，我们未来会有越来越多的产品去呈现和发布，也有信心和能力把这些产品做出符合商业逻辑的生态。\n\n预算：分阶段来看，初期在产品验证阶段低成本快速迭代，打磨产品体验优化产品数据，同时探索商业模式；产品验证+商业闭环验证完毕，可无上限投入。\n\n备份计划：xx用户 + xx场景 + xx社交需求，针对这3个维度做排列组合，比如我们初期是针对 欧美用户 + 实时互动场景  + 陌生社交需求。\n\n补充说明一下映客在整体元宇宙层面上的投入，元宇宙对技术挑战还挺大的，包括虚拟人、虚拟场景，从企业管理方面，会根据当下时机、发展的情况去投入，如果投入会让护城河越扎越深、经济模型完全闭环，也可以是无上限的投入。如果投入是死胡同，肯定不会了。\n\n我们有自己的技术和资源，也会和第三方合作，生态的分工和合作很明确。没有必要每一个轮子自己制作，重要的是能把外面所有的模块组件组合起来去做创新，像苹果也并不是每个部件都自制发明而创造，它重要的是组合创新。\n\n现在短时间内元宇宙的比拼和竞争的要点不在技术，技术的基础设施并不算元宇宙真正的基础设施，目前国内外的公司都没有搭建起来，元宇宙真正的大规模发展，必须等到顶级硬件终端的发布才会对行业产生颠覆性的影响。映客做的是应用层面的创新。映宇宙是由一个一个产品代表的小宇宙共同构成的。\n\n## 第二部分:里程碑项目YING的内容解读\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pY8G6jatAxfYPP3b_uEs.gif?height=750&width=750)\n\n### 1.我们进入第二部分，里程碑项目YING的内容解读。之前在Mirror上发了一篇文章哈，YING-超越之路\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU](https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU)\n\n### 现在给大家详细介绍一下YING的定位：\n\n映映-YING，映宇宙生态型企业形象IP，映宇宙的数字代言人。在产品形态上：映映将在映宇宙中有着不同的身份以及多重任务，我们会看到映映经常出现在积目、超级喜欢、映客直播、情侣星球、原原世界、The Place等社交星球中。\n\n在视觉呈现上：她有四种身份：元宇宙映映，运动达人映映，潮人映映，游戏NPC映映，之后大家也会在制作的NFT系列里发现他们的不同。\n\n在品牌发展的角度：未来，映宇宙将和更多知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌，进行服装、配饰设计。映映（YING NFT ) + 虚拟时尚NFT，能够让IP触达到真正的用户群体和粉丝，也能够帮助映宇宙将线下用户带到线上，让每一个社区用户可以参与到IP运营和共创中，共建映宇宙的Web3新生态。\n\n在社区方面：每一位持有者都将与映映的IP深度绑定，包括品牌合作、NFT系列相关产品等权益。品牌系统形成后，项目合作奖励和社区收益将基于链上记录的贡献。数据将透明的分发给社区成员。\n\n### 2.YING系列为什么定为了7777这个数量？\n\n首先是代表7周年。INKEPASS的1111和Hootbirds的1111，加起来正好是9999，这个也是主流NFT项目的一个体量。另外，在NFT的制作上，我们也有跟数字相关的彩蛋，大家可以关注一下。后面会有很多有意思的玩儿法，这些数字也是跟映客的开始和成长都息息相关的。\n\n### 3.YING是以品牌的角度去发展，这方面有哪些规划可以提前透露的吗？\n\n是的，映映路线图的中心是通过YING链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n有几个部分吧，首先，大背景是映宇宙已经准备好了：\n\n1. 映宇宙会为用户提供更实时的、更同步的、更沉浸式的体验，从2D到3D，从手机到AR/VR，让我们疯狂的想象，借助 AR/VR在映宇宙里进行虚拟社交！\n2. 映宇宙的内容生态由平台和用户共建，除了PGC还有UGC甚至AIGC，我们将为用户提供便捷的创作工具，一起打造丰富的映宇宙内容生态！\n3. 映宇宙会由多个社交元宇宙平台矩阵组成，映映会以映宇宙企业形象IP和数字代言人出现在映宇宙的各个社交元宇宙平台！\n\n**第二方面是生态的共建：**\n\n1. 映宇宙的建立和拓展，需要优秀的人才和团队，HootLabs除了自己的产品研发之外，我们也在持续寻找与我们有共同愿景的最优秀的人才和项目，目前有找我们的一些NFT的数据工具，一些创作者工具等。我们会觉得最有生命力最有意思的创意一定来源于社区，因为社区是最了解项目的人，也是深度参与的人，所以有web3赛道投融资方面的holder优先联系我，之后大家可以加我discord一起探讨；\n2. 映宇宙将与HootLabs社区一起探讨和策划，将映映以更合适且有效的方式引入web3.0并拓展影响力，大家可以投票参与一些组织决策，一起建议建设品牌的全面发展。\n\n**第三方面上品牌建设：**\n\n映映是一个来源于web3，走入web2的形象，链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n\n1\\.持续打造和提升映映在社交媒体影响力，策划内容、服装、场景，完善内容储备；\n\n2\\.以异业合作为主，通过品牌联动、平台联动、艺人联动等增加映映曝光及影响力；\n\n3\\.与各平台相关领域运营建立合作关系，获得流量支持及参与平台活动，拓展商业空间；\n\n4\\.与知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌；\n\n5\\.打造有影响力的直播事件，回馈粉丝及用户；\n\n6\\.策划后续商业合作及广告、代言及周边制作。\n\n让一个nft系列 一个IP更有价值 对于我们来说不是制作更多的nft，而是让这个IP不断的出圈，经营以及合作。我们应该应该相信作为映宇宙的代言人，映映在这方面将有无限的潜力。\n\n**第四方面，制作中的隐藏彩蛋**\n\n隐藏彩蛋会在Twitter和Discord公布，请大家及时关注公告信息。\n\n**第五方面，更多的线下活动**\n\n1\\.带着映映和HootLabs社区用户走进映宇宙的线下社交空间，包括但不限于超级喜欢线下体验店，积目酒吧线下体验店；\n\n2\\.与多家线下商业空间建立合作关系，定期举办映映粉丝线下活动见面会；\n\n3\\.积极参加web3.0行业峰会以及相关NFT展会，持续增加HootLabs和映映的曝光度和影响力。\n\n## 第三部分：自由问答\n\n### Q:为什么能吸引用户用place？Place的哪些功能是web2的app解决不了的？\n\nA:传统的2D社交、交友方式更多是在解决人机交互和信息分发的问题，互动的双方通过信息和内容的交换达成匹配关系，用户本身对于自身的操控感和所属感不强。而真实的线下交友和社交方式更自然，更强调“实时反馈”，3D结合音视频互动会让用户能够更有身临其境的感觉，最大程度上还远了线下的及时反馈和对自我及环境的掌控感。\n\n相比web2，Place引入了NFT作为核心的社交元素，NFT是在web3世界里的是互通的，是属于用户自己的数字资产，NFT代表了用户的圈层、标签、审美、资产，在Place里对用户的Profile是很有力的补充，同时NFT可自动标记人群分类，让各个项目的家人们更容易找到彼此，NFT在place里为用户提供更好更便捷的社交。\n\n### Q:目标用户是谁，具备什么特征？通过什么渠道和方法吸引和触达这批人？\n\nA:目标用户为对于游戏和社交界限感相对不那么敏感的z时代群体，这部分群体对于新产品和新形态持开放态度，传统的社交产品已经无法满足这类用户对于强互动、多元性、即使反馈等的诉求。前期用户群主打欧美市场，中后期会逐渐铺开到全球其他地区。\n\nWeb2方式：通过目标群里接受度较高的社交媒体对产品进行曝光和营销、同时结合产品功能和特定场景生成一些可分享、邀请的场景进行产品内的裂变；web3方式：与web3项目方进行市场合作，以项目入驻的方式进行用户群拓展\n\n### Q：有哪些线下场景的规划吗？例如开店\n\nA：整个映宇宙就是做先上线下的产品矩阵，超级喜欢 积目 都会有线下的体验店和多家合作的商业空间，也会跟艺术家合作，推出我们的吃服装和潮流线下的店，关于线下店是我们可以轻松拿下的项目，可谓势在必得到时也会定期举办一些holder的线下活动。\n\n### Q：INKEPASS在公司的定位？INKEPASS前期宣传不多，关于YING的赋能规划？\n\nA：我们也会分析每个NFT的定位和长期发展路线，INKEPASS 是结合web3 和其他项目的钥匙，在INKEPASS 前期的一些活动比较少，我们的重心放在了Hootbirds和YING的制作上， YING后期会加强活动，投入的资源和精力都会更多，希望用户给我们一些时间，看到我们的决心和改变，因为品牌升级，品牌形象也从猫头鹰升级为YING，因为我们有30天退款保障，代表映客7周年，价格上不会表现太差，YING最有可能打造为蓝筹的项目\n\n### Q：何时能使用到The Place？\n\nA：The Place将会在8月上线", "timestamp": 1658033222, "digest": "Qm5q8mEijvIt_vQcM6yowmlYsdDHpC53IdINEIm8LgU", "contributor": "0x8c41dDc92dFf79746F8D7Ba8B2af8031a60911FF"}

发布积分质押计划；\n\nQ3发布INKE社交型产品The Place，赋能INKEPASS的持有者，建造映客元宇宙的第一颗社交星球；\n\nQ4发布The Place 2.0版，升级社交功能，添加活动功能。\n\n### 6.The Place到底要做什么？作为一款APP，在web3里怎么串联起这些NFT的项目？\n\nThe Place是一个线上虚拟现实的社交产品，我们希望通过将线下的社交互动行为通过3D的方式进行还原，打造一个多元场景，富有沉浸体验的社交互动平台。 Place同时兼容web2和web3，web3里的NFT是Place里社交的核心元素。\n\n### 7.The Place成功的阶段性目标有哪些？投入多少预算去实现？如果阶段性目标没有实现有什么备份计划？\n\nThe Place短期目标在于打造场景和完善用户体验为目标，以及逐步渗透nft的结合场景，中长期还是会结合nft做更多的深入场景；在内容生产方面，前期以平台PGC为主，中期逐渐为用户提供DIY功能往UGC发展 - 这也是元宇宙产品的必经之路试错成本低，可以投入有限的资金验证需求。\n\n所有的互联网产品都是从很小的产品去验证，验证完后，它会长大。如果它能创造很强的体验、具有强社交性强、传播性，可能瞬间会从10万用户膨胀到1000万用户。映客直播当年也从刚开始几个月没有人直播，只有三五个人，到突然一夜之间变成几十万人直播，然后变成全社交事件。所谓的社交产品它都是一个强爆发力，核心本质是能否真正做出强用户体验、强口碑、强传播的产品。\n\n对于营收和预算来说，这是一个动态尝试的过程，元宇宙是一个更新的项目，核心的判断会依据数据变化做决策。可能在三五年之后它会到达爆发点，但在这前几年是要有有积累有沉淀的。\n\n坦白来讲，目前还很初期，我们从0-1，相当于元宇宙的创业公司。看产品究竟多有影响力，还是要等它真正发布的时候，从用户体验来看，有可能它是成功的，也有可能是失败的，这都是正常状态，核心的还是要在大的方向下，做出正确选择和资源投入，在元宇宙趋势下，我们未来会有越来越多的产品去呈现和发布，也有信心和能力把这些产品做出符合商业逻辑的生态。\n\n预算：分阶段来看，初期在产品验证阶段低成本快速迭代，打磨产品体验优化产品数据，同时探索商业模式；产品验证+商业闭环验证完毕，可无上限投入。\n\n备份计划：xx用户 + xx场景 + xx社交需求，针对这3个维度做排列组合，比如我们初期是针对 欧美用户 + 实时互动场景  + 陌生社交需求。\n\n补充说明一下映客在整体元宇宙层面上的投入，元宇宙对技术挑战还挺大的，包括虚拟人、虚拟场景，从企业管理方面，会根据当下时机、发展的情况去投入，如果投入会让护城河越扎越深、经济模型完全闭环，也可以是无上限的投入。如果投入是死胡同，肯定不会了。\n\n我们有自己的技术和资源，也会和第三方合作，生态的分工和合作很明确。没有必要每一个轮子自己制作，重要的是能把外面所有的模块组件组合起来去做创新，像苹果也并不是每个部件都自制发明而创造，它重要的是组合创新。\n\n现在短时间内元宇宙的比拼和竞争的要点不在技术，技术的基础设施并不算元宇宙真正的基础设施，目前国内外的公司都没有搭建起来，元宇宙真正的大规模发展，必须等到顶级硬件终端的发布才会对行业产生颠覆性的影响。映客做的是应用层面的创新。映宇宙是由一个一个产品代表的小宇宙共同构成的。\n\n## 第二部分:里程碑项目YING的内容解读\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pY8G6jatAxfYPP3b_uEs.gif?height=750&width=750)\n\n### 1.我们进入第二部分，里程碑项目YING的内容解读。之前在Mirror上发了一篇文章哈，YING-超越之路\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU](https://mirror.xyz/inkepass.eth/I76F6Ykk0Ctu20stLds_oXYarlwX8PkAJJB9noz3MDU)\n\n### 现在给大家详细介绍一下YING的定位：\n\n映映-YING，映宇宙生态型企业形象IP，映宇宙的数字代言人。在产品形态上：映映将在映宇宙中有着不同的身份以及多重任务，我们会看到映映经常出现在积目、超级喜欢、映客直播、情侣星球、原原世界、The Place等社交星球中。\n\n在视觉呈现上：她有四种身份：元宇宙映映，运动达人映映，潮人映映，游戏NPC映映，之后大家也会在制作的NFT系列里发现他们的不同。\n\n在品牌发展的角度：未来，映宇宙将和更多知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌，进行服装、配饰设计。映映（YING NFT ) + 虚拟时尚NFT，能够让IP触达到真正的用户群体和粉丝，也能够帮助映宇宙将线下用户带到线上，让每一个社区用户可以参与到IP运营和共创中，共建映宇宙的Web3新生态。\n\n在社区方面：每一位持有者都将与映映的IP深度绑定，包括品牌合作、NFT系列相关产品等权益。品牌系统形成后，项目合作奖励和社区收益将基于链上记录的贡献。数据将透明的分发给社区成员。\n\n### 2.YING系列为什么定为了7777这个数量？\n\n首先是代表7周年。INKEPASS的1111和Hootbirds的1111，加起来正好是9999，这个也是主流NFT项目的一个体量。另外，在NFT的制作上，我们也有跟数字相关的彩蛋，大家可以关注一下。后面会有很多有意思的玩儿法，这些数字也是跟映客的开始和成长都息息相关的。\n\n### 3.YING是以品牌的角度去发展，这方面有哪些规划可以提前透露的吗？\n\n是的，映映路线图的中心是通过YING链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n有几个部分吧，首先，大背景是映宇宙已经准备好了：\n\n1. 映宇宙会为用户提供更实时的、更同步的、更沉浸式的体验，从2D到3D，从手机到AR/VR，让我们疯狂的想象，借助 AR/VR在映宇宙里进行虚拟社交！\n2. 映宇宙的内容生态由平台和用户共建，除了PGC还有UGC甚至AIGC，我们将为用户提供便捷的创作工具，一起打造丰富的映宇宙内容生态！\n3. 映宇宙会由多个社交元宇宙平台矩阵组成，映映会以映宇宙企业形象IP和数字代言人出现在映宇宙的各个社交元宇宙平台！\n\n**第二方面是生态的共建：**\n\n1. 映宇宙的建立和拓展，需要优秀的人才和团队，HootLabs除了自己的产品研发之外，我们也在持续寻找与我们有共同愿景的最优秀的人才和项目，目前有找我们的一些NFT的数据工具，一些创作者工具等。我们会觉得最有生命力最有意思的创意一定来源于社区，因为社区是最了解项目的人，也是深度参与的人，所以有web3赛道投融资方面的holder优先联系我，之后大家可以加我discord一起探讨；\n2. 映宇宙将与HootLabs社区一起探讨和策划，将映映以更合适且有效的方式引入web3.0并拓展影响力，大家可以投票参与一些组织决策，一起建议建设品牌的全面发展。\n\n**第三方面上品牌建设：**\n\n映映是一个来源于web3，走入web2的形象，链接元宇宙和现实中的生活。\n\n1\\.持续打造和提升映映在社交媒体影响力，策划内容、服装、场景，完善内容储备；\n\n2\\.以异业合作为主，通过品牌联动、平台联动、艺人联动等增加映映曝光及影响力；\n\n3\\.与各平台相关领域运营建立合作关系，获得流量支持及参与平台活动，拓展商业空间；\n\n4\\.与知名艺术家、服装设计师做品牌联名，打造以映映为形象的虚拟时尚品牌；\n\n5\\.打造有影响力的直播事件，回馈粉丝及用户；\n\n6\\.策划后续商业合作及广告、代言及周边制作。\n\n让一个nft系列 一个IP更有价值 对于我们来说不是制作更多的nft，而是让这个IP不断的出圈，经营以及合作。我们应该应该相信作为映宇宙的代言人，映映在这方面将有无限的潜力。\n\n**第四方面，制作中的隐藏彩蛋**\n\n隐藏彩蛋会在Twitter和Discord公布，请大家及时关注公告信息。\n\n**第五方面，更多的线下活动**\n\n1\\.带着映映和HootLabs社区用户走进映宇宙的线下社交空间，包括但不限于超级喜欢线下体验店，积目酒吧线下体验店；\n\n2\\.与多家线下商业空间建立合作关系，定期举办映映粉丝线下活动见面会；\n\n3\\.积极参加web3.0行业峰会以及相关NFT展会，持续增加HootLabs和映映的曝光度和影响力。\n\n## 第三部分：自由问答\n\n### Q:为什么能吸引用户用place？Place的哪些功能是web2的app解决不了的？\n\nA:传统的2D社交、交友方式更多是在解决人机交互和信息分发的问题，互动的双方通过信息和内容的交换达成匹配关系，用户本身对于自身的操控感和所属感不强。而真实的线下交友和社交方式更自然，更强调“实时反馈”，3D结合音视频互动会让用户能够更有身临其境的感觉，最大程度上还远了线下的及时反馈和对自我及环境的掌控感。\n\n相比web2，Place引入了NFT作为核心的社交元素，NFT是在web3世界里的是互通的，是属于用户自己的数字资产，NFT代表了用户的圈层、标签、审美、资产，在Place里对用户的Profile是很有力的补充，同时NFT可自动标记人群分类，让各个项目的家人们更容易找到彼此，NFT在place里为用户提供更好更便捷的社交。\n\n### Q:目标用户是谁，具备什么特征？通过什么渠道和方法吸引和触达这批人？\n\nA:目标用户为对于游戏和社交界限感相对不那么敏感的z时代群体，这部分群体对于新产品和新形态持开放态度，传统的社交产品已经无法满足这类用户对于强互动、多元性、即使反馈等的诉求。前期用户群主打欧美市场，中后期会逐渐铺开到全球其他地区。\n\nWeb2方式：通过目标群里接受度较高的社交媒体对产品进行曝光和营销、同时结合产品功能和特定场景生成一些可分享、邀请的场景进行产品内的裂变；web3方式：与web3项目方进行市场合作，以项目入驻的方式进行用户群拓展\n\n### Q：有哪些线下场景的规划吗？例如开店\n\nA：整个映宇宙就是做先上线下的产品矩阵，超级喜欢 积目 都会有线下的体验店和多家合作的商业空间，也会跟艺术家合作，推出我们的吃服装和潮流线下的店，关于线下店是我们可以轻松拿下的项目，可谓势在必得到时也会定期举办一些holder的线下活动。\n\n### Q：INKEPASS在公司的定位？INKEPASS前期宣传不多，关于YING的赋能规划？\n\nA：我们也会分析每个NFT的定位和长期发展路线，INKEPASS 是结合web3 和其他项目的钥匙，在INKEPASS 前期的一些活动比较少，我们的重心放在了Hootbirds和YING的制作上， YING后期会加强活动，投入的资源和精力都会更多，希望用户给我们一些时间，看到我们的决心和改变，因为品牌升级，品牌形象也从猫头鹰升级为YING，因为我们有30天退款保障，代表映客7周年，价格上不会表现太差，YING最有可能打造为蓝筹的项目\n\n### Q：何时能使用到The Place？\n\nA：The Place将会在8月上线", "timestamp": 1658033341, "digest": "u2kWwfYCvY8DRszB7vLU_GYAC8PDn8QyY2HMgzve5NA", "contributor": "0x8c41dDc92dFf79746F8D7Ba8B2af8031a60911FF"}

{"id": "Emh-ifMs72HmXMg-JDEmWGK6k5nzJQgaAzzFdxB1sWA", "title": "稳定币新思路", "body": "稳定币在加密世界中是不可或缺的，不单单是因为它目前在DeFi里的重要作用，更基本的，如果一种货币的币值在一个系统中不稳定，它就没法被称作“钱”，就没法很好地做商品交换的媒介和衡量的尺度。其次，币值不稳定的加密货币投机性大，很容易被操控，所以也很难成为为项目服务的工具。 \n\n目前市面上的稳定币，要么是有1:1法币抵押的（ie. USDC)，要么是有加密货币超额抵押的（ie. DAI），但它们都没法做到完全链上自治。算稳的初衷就是想做个不与系统外的货币挂钩的纯链上自治稳定币，但其投机性/反身性让它屡战屡败。一直以来我都在想，如果拿掉投机性这一成分，我们还能做出完全链上自治的稳定币吗？最近看到一个思路让我很兴奋-- **基于mutual credit，可以设计出完全自治的稳定币来衡量交换关系**。\n\n## 什么是mutual credit\n\n人类文化的早期,最自然的交换是以物换物，随着人类群体规模越来越大，信任网络越来越弱，才创造出货币作为物物交换的媒介。然而物物交换这一结构一直还在一些小规模的社区中存在。mutual credit就是一个用于多人进行物物交换的网络，而其中的内生货币用于衡量这一交易关系。我们来看下面的例子：\n\n* Alice, Bob, Carol本身的账户余额都为0：\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FKoizheng%2FlrqfI8UQpZ.png?alt=media&token=3e40ed5f-bb00-465b-a6d3-ede760c3f3ef)\n\n* 当Alice购买了Bob的商品/服务时，Alice的账户余额减少100，Bob的账户余额增加100：\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FKoizheng%2FE7JNAN5xT-.png?alt=media&token=d607a548-7785-4057-95a8-a18a8a6434af)\n\n* 同样的，当Carol购买了Alice的商品/服务时，Carol的账户余额减少100，Alice的账户余额增加100，这使得Alice的账户余额回到0：\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FKoizheng%2FhaHFUlIuyO.png?alt=media&token=0443ecd9-0b4e-43b5-b590-b80894d59946)\n\n* 如果之后Bob想要购买Carol的商品/服务时，Bob的账户余额减少100，Carol的账户余额增加100，这使得网络中每个人的账户余额回到0：\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FKoizheng%2FOl5PViCIAx.png?alt=media&token=8c2a2764-9223-4882-b7b5-911f5f8bc1ca)\n\n由于每次物物交换，系统里都有相等数量的盈余和赤字增加，所以货币供给总额（余额为正）总是与债务总额（余额为负）相匹配。\n\n在现实世界中最具有代表性的mutual credit社区，就是成立于1934年的瑞士WIR银行。WIR银行发行了自己的社区货币--CHW，和瑞士法郎等价；社区里的企业会员可以得到CHW货币的无息贷款用于购买其他会员的商品，未来通过其他会员购买自己的商品来偿还贷款。企业获得无息贷款时需要拿自己生产的商品作为部分抵押，这样一来CHW货币就天然有了社区里每个企业生产的商品作为支撑，所以币值也一直很稳定（88年了😱）。\n\n在分析WIR银行的案例的时候，**会发现区块链更适合做mutual credit这件事情**：首先债务/交换关系可以更清晰地呈现和被追踪，省掉传统金融里清算结算等流程；其次区块链作为一个巨大的账本，可以记录和保存所有的关系数据（分布式IOU)，这使其成为了一个显性的信任网络，这让mutual credit的范围不仅仅局限于一个少数企业会员组成的封闭社群，**让物物交换突破人数的限制**；最重要的是发现了一个做稳定币的新思路：**不靠法币或者其他加密货币做抵押，而是靠系统里提供的真实的商品和服务做支持，可能这才是最抗周期又最去中心化的稳定币**。\n\n## 基于mutual credit的稳定币怎么去设计：\n\n### Tokenomics\n\n* 每一个进入到这个网络里的人，都是因为对其他人的商品/服务有需求；所以每一个存在的货币，都是用于去购买别人的商品和服务，这使得货币本身具备了内在的价值。\n* 货币总供给就是账户余额为正的存款总数（参考上面Alice, Bob, Carol的例子），这代表了提供的总商品和服务的价值；货币总需求就是账户余额为负的未偿还贷款总数，这代表了消耗的总商品和服务的价值。因为每次物物交换，一方提供的商品服务就是一方消耗的商品服务，所以货币总供给永远等于总需求。\n* 同时，货币总供给量也会自动随着系统里提供的商品和服务数量的变化而不断收缩和扩大，有自我调节功能。\n\n### 如何保持币值稳定并和法币1:1\n\n如果不开放市场进行交易，就把投机者排除在外，所以只要对用户来说，自己和他人提供的商品和服务用稳定币和用法币衡量的价值相同，那这个稳定币在他们心中就是和法币同价的。具体可以参考以下三种方法：（这里参考ReSourceFinance 项目的白皮书）\n\n* 用户在衡量自己提供的商品/服务值多少钱的时候是用法币去衡量，但在mutual credit系统里是用稳定币来标价的\n* 欠的债务（账户余额里是负数的部分，用稳定币来标价）如果没有及时用自己的商品来偿还，则平台会以同等的法币金额来追索。\n* 起初给用户发放贷款时，underwriter会stake一定的金额作为这笔贷款的抵押，这部分抵押也是用美金来衡量，但用稳定币来标价的\n\n如果开放市场进行交易，看看币值如何回稳：\n\n* 当币价下跌：余额赤字方（欠债的）会有动力去市场上买更多的币来把自己的赤字平掉；因为欠债的追索和法币是1:1--需求增加\n* 当币价上涨：盈余方会有动力卖掉币；同时用户会提供更多市场上需要的服务来让自己的盈余更多，从而创造出更多货币--供给增加\n\n稳定币的价值很大程度上取决于社区的成员是否遵守游戏规则，有在履行债务义务。所以信用评估、催债、吸收坏账的能力最终保证了币值的稳定。具体可以参考以下一些方法：（这里参考ReSource Finance 项目的白皮书）\n\n* 每个进入mutual credit网络的人都要被进行信用评估（基于传统金融数据和社交网络数据分析）。根据不同的信用评级，每个人在系统里交易时的手续费也不同，信用评级越低的人手续费越高。\n* 一旦有人违约形成坏账，那这个赤字账户就会被移出系统，这时会让系统里的货币供给大于需求，多出的货币需要被系统吸收。当前系统里的余额为正的账户按比例减少货币，直到系统再次达到平衡；这部分损失会用另一个权益token来补偿。\n* 对于违约行为，平台享有同等法币金额的追索权，也可以雇佣第三方追债机构来追债。\n\n### 参考结论：\n\n在一个封闭系统里如何做出一个不需要抵押也不需要靠投机算法的稳定币？\n\n* 如果没想和法币挂钩，只想在自己的项目里有一个币值不变的货币来衡量一种交换关系，那只需要每次交换都在借贷双方的账户里记上一笔，且有措施确保有债务的人去承担义务。\n* 在这个基础上，如果交换的商品和服务在真实世界是有法币标价的，则可以在自己的封闭系统里，用稳定币对货品和债务做同等标价，从而做到币值不变且和法币1:1。\n\n这种衡量人与人之间的交换关系/债权债务关系的稳定币，充分发挥了货币的工具性，让直接的物物交换成为了可能。\n\n*Reference:*\n\n* <https://resource-network.gitbook.io/resource-technical/01-resource-finance/readme>\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIR_Bank>\n* <https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/local-money-liquidity-saving/>", "timestamp": 1658034044, "digest": "7uz1qKp-i-kAbDaWkUOwtHd6RlMLloNTYGOCRqiZaFY", "contributor": "0xa38f6E684E6940AF6a36D002aE7aE9fB062D03AC"}

New virtual currencies such as Bitcoin make it possible for users to transfer money without intermediaries or third parties. This process is called “crypto mixing” and involves assigning digital tokens, so the final receiver appears to be a different user, concealing their real identity. A study by Cisco revealed that cyber criminals are now using crypto mixing services to launder their money while they remain undetected. The report found that over 800 known cryptocurrency mixing services operate as a virtual black market, allowing cybercriminals to hide stolen funds from exchanges and users. Keeping in mind that the value of virtual currencies has grown drastically over the past year, it’s no surprise thieves are jumping on this opportunity. Read on to learn more about this growing trend and how you can protect yourself from being victimized by crypto-laundering hackers.\n\n## What is Crypto Mixing?\n\nCrypto mixing is a type of online money laundering that exchanges one cryptocurrency for another to conceal the source of the funds. Cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralized and to not have any central authority that can control the flow of cash. This makes it nearly impossible to track the source of money sent through these systems. Crypto mixing services have popped up online to help users launder their money. Users send their funds to one of these services and then are sent funds that are of equal value but come from a different wallet address. This way, the source of the funds is almost impossible to trace. There are several different types of mixing services. Some only allow the user to exchange one type of cryptocurrency for another, while others allow the user to send in a wide variety of digital currencies and receive a different assortment in return.\n\n## Why are Crypto Mixers so Popular?\n\nTwo main reasons cybercriminals turn to crypto mixers to launder their money. First, the public image surrounding cryptocurrencies has been tarnished by stories of hackers stealing funds from exchanges. Crypto mixers allow cyber criminals to continue stealing money from an exchange and then send their stolen funds through a crypto mixer to make the stolen funds untraceable. Second, new regulation has made it difficult to move funds through banks. Crypto mixers allow cyber criminals to exchange their fiat money for cryptocurrencies and then send their crypto funds through a crypto mixer to convert their cryptocurrencies into a different digital currency.\n\n## How Does Crypto Mixing Work?\n\nCrypto mixers are online services that allow users to send in their funds and receive a different amount of funds back from a different wallet address. The mixer will exchange your funds for other funds and then send you an additional amount from a different wallet address. Your wallet address is made up of a long string of letters and numbers. The mixing service will take your wallet address and then add random numbers to the end of your wallet address. The service will then send your funds along with other users’ funds to the exchange wallet address. The exchange will then send your funds along with the other funds to the receiving wallet address specified by the user. The funds that the mixing service gets from the exchange will use a different wallet address than the receiving wallet address that the user specified. This way, the source of the funds is almost impossible to trace.\n\n## 3 Services Used by Cyber Criminals\n\nThere are a variety of crypto mixing services that cyber criminals use, each with their own unique features. Below, we’ve listed a few crypto mixing services that are used by cybercriminals. Bitcoin Fog - Bitcoin Fog is one of the most popular crypto mixers that are used by cybercriminals. You can only deposit and withdraw Bitcoin and you can’t withdraw fiat money. There is a minimum withdrawal of 0.001 BTC/ 0.001 ETH per month. \n\nCrypto Fog - This service allows you to deposit and withdraw various virtual currencies. There is a minimum withdrawal of 0.01 ETH. \n\nBitCloak - This option allows you to deposit and withdraw various virtual currencies. There is a minimum withdrawal of 0.01 ETH. \n\nBitcoin Mixer - This option allows you to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin. There is a minimum withdrawal of 0.001 BTC.\n\n## How to Protect Yourself from Crypto-Laundering?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from crypto-laundering is to know what signs to look for if you’re using a crypto mixer. Here are some things to look for if you’re using a crypto mixer. Slow Withdrawals - If you’re using a mixing service, it might take you a week or two to receive your funds. If you’re sending your money to a mixing service and then you wait for weeks and weeks for your money, something is wrong. Increased Minimum Withdrawal Amount - Mixing services are generally free to use, but some may charge a small fee. If the mixing service you’re using suddenly increases the minimum withdrawal amount, the service may be a scam.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCyber criminals are using crypto mixing services to launder their money while they remain undetected. The value of virtual currencies has grown drastically over the past year, and it’s no surprise that thieves are jumping on this opportunity. Make sure to stay informed about these crypto mixing services and how they work so you can protect your assets from being stolen by cyber criminals. \n \n\nBuy me a coffee [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/xuanling1111) if you want to support my writing.\n\nPhoto by [Towfiqu barbhuiya](https://unsplash.com/@towfiqu999999?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cyber-crime?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)", "timestamp": 1658034151, "digest": "mpKWwjCl3XecJYBR1aVgZuYp7fLznAOdfKPA4apHTS0", "contributor": "0x87D5032831E5C092c87eb879e5108da7D58f9192"}

DYDX/DeversiFi\n   1\\.1 空投回顾\n\nDYDX空投分配方案\nDYDX空投分配方案\n大约是从DYDX开始，空投的规则变得复杂起来。项目方为不同资金量的用户设置了不同的等级（门槛）。\n\nDeversiFi空投分配方案\nDeversiFi空投分配方案\nDeversiFi成功吸取了在DYDX的经验，在设置资金门槛的基础上，还增加了活跃度的门槛，这一规则一直被沿用至现在，包括OP、Across（已提案）在内的各项目方的空投方案都在参考这样的方法。\n\n1\\.2 启示\n面对DEFI或跨链桥等需要一定资金的项目时，我们可以通过Dune、Footprint来跟踪项目的交易量，想办法让每个钱包的交易额/跨链量超过一定比例的用户，达到某一个门槛。同时也不要忘记至少每周使用一次要空投的项目，并在各个链上留有一定的资金（大约5-10刀）\n\n1\\.3 实战案例：找到门槛\n使用dune查看nomad跨链桥的状态：\n\nDune\nDune\nBlockchain ecosystem analytics by and for the community.

Paraswap/HOP\n   2\\.1 空投回顾\n   项目方需要羊毛党的交互的数据，羊毛党需要项目方的空投，两者真正的相爱相杀可能要从Paraswap开始算起，在HOP发币时达到一个巅峰。\n\nPSP非常严格的空投标准\nPSP非常严格的空投标准\nPSP发币前一直在利用空投PUA用户，拿到融资后立刻执行了更加严格的空投方案——通过修改空投方案，光明正大地把许多用户归为空投猎人，一个币也不给。这让许多普通用户也被反撸，导致了大量的不满，其代币也在空投后在不断地贬值，这个故事在HOP上延续着。\n\nHOP空头标准，资金量和LP是重点\nHOP空头标准，资金量和LP是重点\n虽然后来的OP也同样不欢迎女巫，但是HOP让用户相互举报女巫的行为可谓是所有空投标准中的“集大成”者，这一次许多撸毛党都栽在了这里。\n\n区块律动上的一篇案例分析\n区块律动上的一篇案例分析\n2\\.2 启示\n2\\.2.1 避免资金归集。\n\n目前来看，使用交易所归集、分发是最稳妥、省钱的方法，需要注意的是，存款的时候应该存入子账号，避免全部转入相同地址后被认定为女巫。\n\n2\\.2.2 混肴操作。\n\n根据早先一些被举报案例的报道，项目方主要通过资金归集、操作相似、时间相同、社交网络泄露地址并被举报等方式来鉴定女巫。\n\n所以我们的在交互的时候至少应该避免以上的操作方式，同时还应该具备一定的前瞻性，把IP、浏览器痕迹（cookie）都考虑进来。\n\n2\\.3 实战案例\n2\\.3.1 账号隔离\n\n这里介绍一下我自己防女巫的操作方法：\n\n我的操作方式\n我的操作方式\na.使用多台电脑，每台电脑使用不同的VPN，保证IP不重复，平常使用chrome浏览器，且不接受任何cookie，用不同的谷歌账号开子浏览器管理钱包\n\nb.每个谷歌账号中只有一套助记词（方便管理），助记词下配一个精撸账号（即有ENS、有大量交易纪录等）和5个以内的子钱包（可以互相转账，方便操作），组成一个钱包集\n\nc.钱包集之间互相不能转账，严格隔离\n\nd.一般情况下不使用批量刷的软件，一是保证钱包安全，二是避免被女巫\n\ne.不明来源文件使用虚拟机打开，浏览器精简不必要的插件，不要心怀侥幸。\n\n2\\.3.2 交易所相关操作\n\na.归集资金\n\n中心化交易所仍然是最方便的跨链/隐私协议，资金归集的时候可以使用OKX、币安、FTX这些交易所。但是你的交易所钱包是固定的，所以归集资金时应该创建子账号，不同钱包集的资金打入不同的账号。\n\nb.分发资金\n\n我最近开始使用Layerswap来分撒资金，这是一个为交易所提供跨链功能的DAPP归集\n\n交易所跨链项目Layeswap\n交易所跨链项目Layeswap\n使用这个DAPP，你需要获得交易所的API，注册Bransfer和Layerswap账户，步骤挺繁琐，但是不排除空投的可能，所以既然要转账，不如试试看。\n\n篇幅有限，具体方法就不介绍了，这里找到一个参考的教程，时间有点早了，不保障完全可用。作者好像是@baikaishui，未仔细核实。\n\nLayerSwap交互教程\nLayerSwap交互教程\n背景：使用LayerSwap，您可以将加密货币从您的加密货币交换账户直接发送到第2层网络，而无需支付高昂的Gas费用。支持的网络包括Arbitrum，Optimism，zkSync，Boba和Ronin（Axie Infinity）。\nmirror.xyz\n当然，你也可以使用zkMoney归集资金，这也是一个必刷的协议，这类金融类产品最好增加交互的金额，提高你的空投权重（如果有的话）。\n\nzk.money · Private DeFi has arrived!\nzk.money · Private DeFi has arrived!\nCheckout zk.money by @aztecnetwork. Private DeFi is here. 🕵️.\nzk.money\n2\\.3.3 操作随机\n\n我们的交互至少应该做到部分随机，以我自己为例，相同的交互操作每天只能在两个钱包集以内的账号上完成，且做到以下几点：\n\na.避免交互后立即反向操作，如跨链后立即跨回，交易usdt后立即买回原来的币\n\nb.时间随机，一个钱包集交互后暂停一天以上的时间再做其他操作，如跨链后间隔三天再回到其他链\n\nc.每个账户使用的金额完全随机，如有的钱包使用1eth交互，有的钱包使用0.2eth交互\n\n1. Optimism\n   3\\.1 空投回顾\n\n原文链接：<https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/#active-ethereum-participants>\n原文链接：<https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/#active-ethereum-participants>\n有PSP和HOP的前车之鉴，Optimism的空投方案可谓是集大成者，既照顾了普通用户，也没有对羊毛党赶尽杀绝，很好的达到了项目方推广自己代币的同时又回馈忠实用户的目的\\~\\~，可惜被WinterMute玩崩了\\~\\~。\n\n可以看到，OP作为一个由DAO构成的L2公链，十分注重链上公益行为。\n\n这里我们把空投方案的细则一条条拉出来详细讲解。\n\n3\\.2 启示\n3\\.2.1 链上投票\n\n这个没什么好说的，经常参与各个项目的投票，可能会收获意想不到的福报。\n\na.在Layer0上面质押STG参与投票，虽然Stargate已经发币，但是Layer0作为一个公链，不发币是很难维持开支的。类似的操作\n\nb.OP认可的链上投票有：Coumpound、Aave、Curve、Maker、Aragon\n\n3\\.2.2 多签\n\n多签账户不仅能获得额外的空投，而且还有一些豁免权，项目方在各方面的标准都会降低一些，这类账户一般是由DAO的领导者持有。但是也不一定，兔子洞推荐的Gnosis Safe就很适合大家，我们完全可以自己发起一个DAO，然后以DAO的身份参与各种项目。\n\n需要注意的是，OP对多签的要求是链上交易数量要超过10条，未来的空投可能还会继续提高门槛。所以，关于交易数……你懂吧。\n\ngnosis-safe的玩法很多，这里不细说，只做一个小建议，用电脑配手机gnosis app+ metamask app的方式组成两个多签人为一组的多签账号，会比较方便。\n\n3\\.2.3Gitcoin捐赠\n\n这个没什么好说的，在主网交易可以增加交易数量，并且以后可能很多L2项目是不认zksync的捐赠的，想去zksync上省钱的自己注意别捐错了就好。\n\n3\\.2.4 主网交互者\n\n还是那句话，OP是一个注重公益行为的公链，所以保持在主网上的交易记录是一个很好的习惯，缺点就是真的挺贵的，每周等gas低的时候随便。据某社区大神们的推荐，主网上最便宜的操作应该是：走zks官方桥、刷approve、gitcoin捐款、领noox徽章、free mint图狗等。\n\n3\\.2.5 交互的资金量\n\n对比其他空投标准，我们会发现，像OP这样的公链+DAO，对交互的资金是没有要求的，而DEFI类本身就带有金融属性的项目，会考虑你交互的金额。\n\n3\\.3 实战案例\n3\\.3.1 一鱼多吃\n\n这个交互方法很早就有了，@丰密应该是这方面的集大成者，他的这篇教程推荐大家都去看看\n\n10美金一肉多吃交互+持有顶级蓝筹NFT：zora+party+rabbithole+BAYC无聊猿\n10美金一肉多吃交互+持有顶级蓝筹NFT：zora+party+rabbithole+BAYC无聊猿\n作者：丰密\nmirror.xyz\n很多交互工作我们可以放在一块来做，例如通过Gnosis创建一些ARB和主网的多签账户，然后参与投票、捐赠、刷主网数据、完成noox成就等工作。虽然有点费Gas，但是摇身一变，成为DAO负责人，是有可能让你在未来获得超额的收益的。\n\n关于多签的玩法还有很多，比如Utopia、coinshift，以及一些DAO工具，考虑到一些不安全因素，需要大家自己去探索，这里就算是抛砖引玉了。\n\n重要提醒：多签账户的地址仅支持一个公链，不同的公链请一定创建不同的多签账户，千万不要做WinterMute那样的傻事。\n\n3\\.3.2 zkSync交互\n\nzkSync是肯定有大毛的，建议全方位、多角度地交互。\n\na.zkSync 1.0 （必做）\n\n基本操作：[ETH通过官方跨链桥跨链-注册pinata并上传图片上链-复制CID后到wallet.zksync.io/account/nft](http://xn--ETH-pinata-CIDwallet-kk45aa705d6yqs1dme144covuzunvrsm4uo96c6osb88alk3bx31pba113pq4c8y8ecap.zksync.io/account/nft) 自己Mint NFT-zigzag换出usdc-注册并激活Argent钱包-参与Gitcoin捐赠（等下一期）-Orbiter跨链回主网或其他L2\n\n高级：主网上配合多签投票、质押（注意不能跨链）、ENS\n\nb.zkSync 2.0 (testnet）\n\n测试网的项目大概率不发币，但是可能会提高zks空投时赋予你的权重（multiplier)。这里可以看看水多多分享的zkSync项目集，自己挑一些心仪的项目做做，意思一下就好。\n\n👉作者推特：水多多|zkSync - Airtable\n👉作者推特：水多多|zkSync - Airtable\nzkSync生态项目汇总 zkSync Project Collection\n[airtable.com](http://airtable.com)\n3\\.3.3 分币\n\n参与Snapshot投票只需要你有相应的代币或者质押的代币，本身是不花钱的，所以一定要多多参与，我们每个钱包都应该准备一些被看好的投票项目。\n\n使用bebop可以一币换多币，你可能需要一些aave、uni这样的代币，这是由wintermute打造的一个聚合DEX。\n\nbebop的缺点是gas略高，但是可以顺便博一下空投，值得试试。想要使用的话得加入discord申请白名单。\n\nJoin the Bebop Discord Server!\nJoin the Bebop Discord Server!\nMake the most out of every exchange. Trade two or multiple tokens in one go, efficiently. | 7,913 members\n[discord.gg](http://discord.gg)\n进入discord验证身份，然后在waitlist处申请，大概需要等待一两天的时间才能通过。\n\n分币后我们可以用相应的代币进行投票。这里推荐一个新投票提示的小工具：\n\nSign In with Auth0\nSign In with Auth0\nProtected with\n[app.boto.io](http://app.boto.io)\n要注意，必须在投票开始前持有相应的币才能投票，有的投票需要质押的币，比如vsSTG\n\n4\\.总结\n最后我们再来总结、预判一下项目方的预判：\n\n1\\.金融属性强的项目往往会有资金门槛，公链可能会放宽条件（stark这种商业公司例外）\n\n2\\.项目方查女巫的方式会不断升级\n\n3\\.项目方会提高对积极参与链上工作的用户的权重\n\n4\\.特定的NFT、ENS、LENS可能有助于获得更多空投\n\n5\\.链上存有一定资金（如主网对应ETH，Polygon对应Matic）可能会是某些空投的必要条件\n\n6\\.对项目方有多种贡献的用户会获得更高权重的空投（如交互+LP+Role）\n\n7\\.不排除二次空投的可能，保留或者质押少许token或许是个明智的选择\n\n8\\.用机器人刷交互会导致同样的行为轨迹且安全性欠佳，不建议使用\n\n9\\.Argent、Defi Saver、DeBank 、Zerion这些钱包及看板DAPP也集成有交易和投资公告，可适当使用，或许有空投", "timestamp": 1658034378, "digest": "JhlJgQJHySPrPaAxujRK7Zf5y8B8TwvzjrtL8AWLnDo", "contributor": "0x44821E910e6b53B6c9a416abAd4Ec40e35463DEC"}

なかなか仕組みとか入り口が分かりにくい（自分もそうでした）と思うので、もっといろんな人が興味を持ったらいいなという思いで紹介をしてみようと思います。念のためNFAであり売買をするときはDYORでよろしくお願いします\n\n言いたいことがいっぱいあるのですごい長くなる予感がしますが、それでは始めてみます\n\n# Art Blocksとは\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8bUcwFzTtqlZOglaPFar.png?height=217&width=811)\n\nArt Blocksとはなにかについてまずは[公式のサイト](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)にある創業者のSnowfro（Chromie Squiggleの作者）の言葉で始めてみます\n\n> Art Blocksは、イーサリアム・ブロックチェーン上に不変に保存される、プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツに焦点を当てた、これまでにないタイプのプラットフォームです。\n>\n> 好きなコレクションを選び、作品の代金を支払うと、アルゴリズムによってランダムに生成されたバージョンのコンテンツが作成され、あなたのイーサリアムアカウントに送られます。出来上がった作品は、静止画像であったり、3Dモデルであったり、インタラクティブな体験であったりします。出力はそれぞれ異なり、プラットフォーム上で作成できるコンテンツの種類には無限の可能性があります。\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/learn](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)\n\nアーティストはコレクションを生み出すコードを登録し、購入者がサイトからmintをするとトランザクションごとに、コードに組み込まれたランダムな要素が組み合わさって一定の共通のスタイルであるけれどもそれぞれが異なる作品を生み出すプラットフォームがArt Blocksです。すでに存在している作品から選ぶのではなくmintに参加することでコレクターが作品を生み出す体験ができることが魅力の1つだと思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートに興味がない、NFT ARTに興味がない人でもArt Blocksのことはなんとなく聞いたことがある（からこの記事を読んでいると思いますが）人はそれなりにいると思います。それはArt BlocksがすでにNFTの1つのジャンルを代表するブランドになっているからだと思います。\n\n今後NFTの世界がより広がり多くの新しい人たちが入ってきたときにもアートの入り口として存在しているなら、人々をひきつける作品を継続的に生み出すプラットフォームとしてNFTの世界でのアートのカテゴリでのブランドであり続けているかもしれないですね。\n\nArt Blocksの魅力、可能性についてZenecaが熱く語っている記事が2つ、またCoincheck NFTでArt Blocksを購入できるので、Coincheckの紹介記事も分かりやすいのでので合わせてどうぞ\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks)\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2)\n\n[https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494](https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494)\n\n# Generative Artとは\n\nArt Blocksの紹介の中に出てきた「プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツ」＝**ジェネラティブアート**にそもそもなんで高い値段がつくのか分からない、という人も多いと思います（自分もそうでした）\n\nジェネラティブアートがなにかについては入門記事として必ず名前が出る「ジェネラティブアートを愛する理由」という記事が素晴らしいので、Art Blocksに興味があれば時間のある時にぜひ読んでみてほしいです。\n\n[https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/](https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/)\n\nいくつか自分が記事を読んでなるほどなー、と思ってジェネラティブアートは良いぞ！と思うに至ったポイントなどを引用を交えつつ簡単にまとめてみます。\n\n### ジェネラティブ・アートは20世紀美術の中心的テーマの拡張\n\n> 幾何学的、抽象化、偶然性は、ジェネラティブ・アートに限らず、20世紀のあらゆるアートにとって主要なテーマです。以下のような主題がこれらはコンピューターを使っていない20世紀初頭の作品から強く感じることが出来て、ジェネラティブアートとつながっていることを強く感じることが出来ます。\n\n* 分析的キュビスムにおける幾何学の破壊\n* 未来派、構成主義、バウハウスにはじまるテクノロジー重視、マシン美学、機械化された生産\n* ダダ、シュルレアリスム、抽象表現主義における自律と偶然の導入\n* 新造形主義、シュプレマティスム、ハード・エッジ、オプ・アートの非比喩的美学、力強い幾何学、鮮明な色使い\n* ソル・ルウィットらによるアルゴリズムの使用\n\n![左から、Circles in a Circle – Wassily Kandinsky, 1923、Highway and Byways – Paul Klee, 1928、Suprematist Composition – Kasimir Malevich, 1916　今のジェネラティブアートに通じるものを強く感じます](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQJNTIr4szr7UXa0L-yvQ.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\n> 一方でジェネラティブアートの定義として\n>\n> **「ジェネラティブアートとは、コンピュータを使い、創造のプロセスの一部に意図的に偶然性を取り入れたプログラムで作られたアートのことである。」**\n>\n> とされますが、2つの間違った見方をよくされることがあります。\n\n### よくある誤解・その1\n\nアーティストは創作のプロセス全体を完全に制御していて、プログラムは常に書かれた通りに実行されるだけである。それゆえジェネラティブアートは、たとえ人間的で親しみやすいものだったとしても、偶然性、偶発性、発見性、自発性を欠いている。\n\n### よくある誤解・その2\n\nアーティストはまったく制御することなく、自律的なマシンがランダムにデザインを生成しているだけである。コンピュータがアートを作っていて、人間は制作者には値しない。本当のアートとはいえないのだから。\n\nジェネラティブアートは作品に導入する偶然性を丁寧にコントロールされています。秩序の中の偶然性、と聞くと人の手が入らないあらゆる自然の中にあるものを思い浮かべます。受け取り方は人それぞれだと思いますがジェネラティブアートを見ていて時々はっとした気持ちになって心を奪われるのはそういう側面もあるのかな、と思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートは現代のアートの一つの形であり、NFT、Cryptoの外の世界にも存在するものなので、NFT外のアートに関心がある人たちにとっては特殊なものではなく受け入れやすいアートの形式なのかもしれません。\n\n# Art Blocksの仕組み\n\nだいぶ話が飛躍しましたがArt Blocksの紹介に戻ります。\n\n![左からFidenza、Ringers、Archetype](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TdQfBj9BkM47n1SZ5VVYq.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\nArt

Blocksはいわゆる「NFT ART」に属するので盛り上がっている時期はそれなりに取引がありますが、PFPなど他のジャンルが盛り上がっている時期には、多くの人の関心が無くなってほとんど取引が無くなるようなこともあります。なので短期（1か月以内）で利益を出すことを目的とするのには向いていないのでそこは気を付けてください。\n\nなによりも自分が気に入っていつまでも持っていたい、と思える作品に出会ったらそれを購入して、多くの人にその作品とジェネラティブアートとArt Blocksの楽しさ、良さを伝えていけるような良い出会いがあるのが一番だと思います。（👇は自分が持っていてお気に入りのHōrō）\n\n[https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096](https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096)\n\nブロックチェーンを通じてコードによって生み出されてNFTになる、という仕組みは多くのその他のカテゴリの中でもかなりNFT、ブロックチェーンをがっつり活用した仕組みだと思っています。自分はいつの間にかジェネラティブアートが大好きになってしまったので、これからも機会を見て作品を増やしたいな、と思っているのでした。",

现有的金融体系对富裕阶级的人非常有利；当然，他们不懂加密货币。\n\n原文：https://defisurfer808.substack.com/p/why-the-1-dont-get-it\n\n作者：DeFi Surfer\n\n编译：柳叶惊鸿\n\n### **译者的话**\n\n本篇文章适合加密货币初学者，以及进阶学习者阅读。用较短的篇幅公允的介绍了加密货币的核心特性，然后由现有货币系统的风险与缺陷引入加密货币系统的必要性。在没有什么技术名词的情况下，从金融学/经济学角度带领读者浏览了一遍加密世界、金融体系的宏观视野。\n\n其中一些俚语、专业术语我会以译者注的形式在段落下方标注。并且有一些我认为偏颇的观点，以及中文语境难以理解的点，也都用译者注给大家补充完整。希望大家能有一个不错的阅读体验。\n\n### **作品前提**\n\n自2009年比特币推出以来，加密货币迅速崛起，但大多数人仍然不明白加密货币为什么存在，以及它的潜力是什么。根据我的经验，这个问题在受过高等教育和相对富裕的人群中最为尖锐。与其他人口结构相比，富人很难理解现有金融体系的严重缺陷，也无法理解加密技术可以提供什么价值。如果一个系统对某一特定群体非常有效，那么他们就没有理由去理解替代方案，更不用说去寻找它们了。\n\n这篇文章提供了对加密货币的简单介绍，并在（非常）高的层次上解释了新兴技术的“为什么”。虽然这篇文章可能不会让你相信加密货币只不过是一个泡沫，但即使是最狂热的加密怀疑论者也应该对加密货币技术和潜在的未来应用有更大的了解。\n\n如果您需要进一步说服力，当我说加密是自互联网以来最深刻的创新时，请相信我。每个人都应该至少熟悉加密技术采用的原因，尤其是富人。毕竟，你也不想落后，不是吗?”：-)\n\n### **简介:什么是加密货币**\n\n加密货币是区块链技术的一种具体应用。区块链技术可以被视为数字账本。区块是数据的集合，通常在加密货币的情况下进行交易。根据系统的设计，每隔一定的时间，每个区块都会被添加到数字账本中，即区块链。区块链实际上是一个“帐单序列”，它线性地保存着记录的交易历史。\n\n加密货币是用于促进价值交换的区块链。比特币是最早也是最著名的加密货币。简单来说，比特币区块链是一个数字账本，用来追踪谁拥有多少比特币。(注大写B Bitcoin是用来指比特币网络的;小写b bitcoin用来指加密货币比特币)。比特币被编程成只会存在2100万个比特币，通常被认为是数字价值存储或数字黄金，即林迪价值存储资产。\n\n*译者注：“林迪价值存储资产”指的是具备林迪效应的资产，林迪效应（Lindy effect）是指，对于一些不会自然消亡的东西，比如一种技术、一个想法，它们的预期寿命和它们目前已经存在的时间成正比。即它每多生存一段时间，它的剩余预期寿命就会增加一点*。\n\n比特币最深刻的创新是其共识机制 - 工作量证明（PoW）。高度简化的PoW共识是一个过程，在这个过程中，计算机网络竞争以获得验证区块链交易的权利。在PoW下，每台验证交易的计算机都被称为“矿工”。作为对他们努力的回报，矿工将获得网络的加密货币奖励，或者比特币网络中的比特币。作为一种开源协议，任何人都可以将他们的计算机添加到比特币网络中，并验证比特币自2009年推出以来交易的真实性。\n\n到目前为止非常简单。但你可能会想“那又怎样？\n\n\\*\\*“那又怎样？”：\\*\\*PoW 的设计使独立参与者的庞大网络得以发展。随着更多资金进入网络，比特币价格上涨，更多矿工被激励加入网络。随着越来越多的矿工加入网络，对网络的信任度就越高，进入网络的资金就越多，如此循环往复。\n\n这种优雅的激励机制创造了一个由独立操作的计算机组成的巨大网络，专门保存比特币交易的简单账本。自2009年推出以来，比特币网络发展迅速，拥有超过1亿比特币个人所有者，估计有100万名矿工，市值约为4000亿美元，成为全球第17大资产。比特币的普及速度迅速，堪比早期的互联网。\n\n![绿色为互联网用户增长量，蓝色为加密用户增长量](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d05_aK2r6huBd_qhOX_wO.png?height=345&width=612)\n\n让我们回顾一下发生的事情。\n\n在完全没有组织的情况下，超过一亿的活跃参与者因为不同原因被吸引加入到比特币网络中来。这是一场没有任何中心化权利参与的活动，没有政府，也没有任何强制性的因素。仅仅因为代码和简单的激励措施，比特币已经成功地让来自世界各地的个体，慢慢地组成一个与国家人数规模相当的网络进行长期的合作和协调，并在这样的过程中产生了交换价值。\n\n当你想到它时，这真是令人难以置信。\n\n市值排名第二的加密货币是以太坊，它建立在比特币的共识创新基础上，但引入了可编程性。以太坊是一种具有智能合约功能的加密货币。以太坊上的智能合约允许用户通过互联网签署协议，并通过代码执行，而不是像比特币网络只能管理比特币交易那样的唯一应用案例。例如，在以太坊上，你可以在借贷平台Aave上借钱，你可以使用自动做市商Uniswap将一项资产交换到另一项资产，或者你可以在NFT平台OpenSea上购买一件艺术品或头像。\n\n虽然现在为时尚早，但有了以太坊，你可以看到基于互联网的全球金融体系的潜力；一个没有国界的系统，一个任何人都可以通过互联网访问的系统，一个没有第三方寻租从每笔交易中抽成的系统。值得注意的是，以太坊的发展速度甚至比比特币更快，尽管它比比特币年轻了6年多，但其钱包数量几乎是比特币的两倍(以太坊于2015年推出)。\n\n![蓝色为以太坊钱包增长量，红色为比特币钱包增长量](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0EGA56GsmuBrGQjM3QF0N.png?height=522&width=479)\n\n希望现在您已经开始看到加密货币的重要性和一些潜在的用例，如价值交换。\n\n为了进一步强调几个关键点，作为去中心化的公有链，比特币和以太坊是：\n\n* 无需信任：它们不需要一个中心化机构来协调双方或更多方参与者。\n* 抗审查：全世界成千上万的活跃参与者独立维护着这些网络。因此，公司，个人和政府几乎不可能阻止任何具有互联网连接的人访问协议。\n* 安全：就比特币而言，要攻击该协议，它需要控制51%的网络，我估计这至少需要约80亿美元的计算机硬件设备，然后再考虑数十亿美元的资金以及多年的精心准备来进行必要的基础设施投资。\n\n一句话，比特币和以太坊是公开的区块链，世界上的任何人都可以在没有管理员的情况下访问，也不用担心有敌意的参与者会侵占你的财产。\n\n译者注：原作者是广义上的区块链不被篡改带来的安全性，但在实际场景中依然存在被恶意攻击者进行钓鱼攻击、后门攻击的黑客行为。\n\n这是一件大事！在加密技术出现之前，人类需要一个政府来执行这样一个庞大的全球化系统。\n\n对于我们当中的富人来说，这是一个很好的机会，你可能会在更高维度上了解这项技术，并认识到许多人选择参与其中。但你可能仍然高度怀疑。如果你是这样的人，你可能会认为当前的系统运行得很好。但这到底有什么意义?\n\n让我们从货币开始，探索当前的范式，以更好地理解加密货币如何为现有的金融系统提供一个有趣的替代方案。\n\n### **法币系统的根本缺陷**\n\n实际上，当前以美元为核心的法币货币体系作为全球储备货币和西方政府的永久赤字支出是不可持续的。在我们有生之年，其他一些替代方案将会出现。而赤字开支的政府货币，如美元，将在未来几十年大幅贬值。考虑到这种可能性，个人要谨慎地保护自己不受货币贬值的影响。加密货币，特别是比特币，为这种困境提供了一个有趣的解决方案。\n\n自尼克松政府正式结束美元与黄金挂钩的布雷顿森林体系以来，美国联邦政府的预算一直处于严重的负面状态。上世纪70年代兴起的石油美元体系使美元成为有效的全球储备货币。作为全球储备货币，对美元的需求超出了仅凭美国经济规模就能证明的合理水平，这使得美国能够在不大幅贬值美元的情况下，消费大于收入。美国利用了这一现状，使得美国的累积赤字超过20万亿美元。趋势实际上是#UpOnly。\n\n*译者注：#UpOnly是推特的一个话题标签，意为一路上涨、单边上涨。*\n\n#### 美国的赤字是#UpOnly:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4TkoiirEV5t8IlpIf_Uq-.png?height=174&width=612)\n\n从2009年开始，在全球金融危机(GFC)期间，美国政府支出开始激增。自那以后，外国对美国政府债券的需求一直在萎缩。如下图所示，这一问题在COVID危机期间进一步加剧。其他国家越来越不希望美国政府肆意挥霍。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c6Kb98e2FlkHkH3VPjZIY.png?height=424&width=612)\n\n\\* 按国家划分的国债购买:全球金融危机期间最大的买家是新冠肺炎期间的净卖家\\*\n\n为了填补外国买家离开美国国债市场留下的空白，美联储开始从财政部购买债券，这一过程被称为量化宽松(QE)。量化宽松可以被认为是政府印钞票来为自己融资，而不是增加税收或削减开支。通过量化宽松印钞已证明自己是为政府支出融资的更受欢迎的解决方案，而不是像希腊那样在全球金融危机后采取的紧缩措施所表明的替代方案。\n\n对于喜欢图像化的学习者来说，这是量化宽松的图像化表现：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ADxqE9YbGge_mGzYpHeg2.png?height=575&width=612)\n\n美联储作为美国国债的最大买家，在全球金融危机之后将利率保持在非常低的水平，使政府能够以有利的利率(即廉价债务)为自己融资。另一方面，美国政府在廉价融资的情况下，没有动力去解决联邦政府预算的结构性问题。由于社会保障和医疗保险等慷慨的福利项目，随着美国老年人口超过工作年龄人口的增长，几十年来，美国政府的支出增长速度一直快于税收收入，因此税基也随之增加。\n\n![Source: CBO May 2022 Forecast](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eM60yWMFlyoadLdLaNzDk.png?height=350&width=612)\n\n在过去十年中，美联储成为美国国债的最大持有者，积累了大约40%的长期国债。最近，美联储被迫逆转其量化宽松政策，以控制因新冠肺炎危机期间的极端印钞导致的通货膨胀，当时美国政府的货币供应量增长了约40%。量化紧缩(QT)的过程与量化宽松相反:美联储停止购买国债，货币供应收缩。美联储在2021年11月开始向市场发出QT即将到来的信号，导致国债收益率大幅上升，加密货币等风险资产大幅抛售。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/smykMW9hZihDO60PJkHP2.png?height=671&width=612)\n\n美国政府和美联储面临着一个严重的问题。如果美联储依靠自由市场来为美国联邦政府的赤字提供资金，政府的债务利率将有可能远远高于美国过去十年的大部分时间。要知道，美联储购买了联邦政府未偿还长期债务的约40%。这至少40%的国债发行需求必须被替代，而最大的需求来源之一，外国政府，他们不想为美国政府的支出提供资金。这些都是需要填补的巨大需求缺口。\n\n如果提高利率，政府的支出能力将受到双重负面影响。首先，更高的利息支出导致更大的政府赤字(从而发行更多的债券)。其次，更不利的是，随着债务成本上升导致经济放缓，利率上升导致税收下降。对于一个债务驱动、公民债务不断增加的社会来说，经济放缓是大忌。\n\n到2032年，联邦政府每年至少要为1.5-2.0万亿美元的赤字提供资金。在利率上升、经济增长放缓的情况下，这个问题会变得更加严重。\n\n#### 美国存在巨大的赤字问题;在利率上升和经济增长放缓的情况下，问题只会变得更糟。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Lj_UDrWKo8wmmSX-cUWF.png?height=286&width=612)\n\n美国政府的这种长期赤字体系为普通美国人带来了巨大的成本。随着政府控制的美国人的消费能力越来越强，医疗、教育、住房等受到政治青睐行业在美国人的平均钱包中所占的比重也越来越大：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tY1yxpxNqiJvYoFoA33Pc.png?height=742&width=612)\n\n此外，资产价格上涨和中产阶级购买力下降，导致最富有的美国人享有的财富份额不断增加。当普通民众为一块日益缩小的蛋糕而竞争时，对于那些管理国家的人(政府和富人)来说，几乎没有什么动力去改变现有的制度。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eiK1Ia4eg6wE9ksjDyrZV.png?height=250&width=612)\n\n尽管美国的财政状况令人担忧，但其他许多国家的情况甚至更糟。\n\n日本预示着美国在不久的将来的财政状况会是什么样子。日本央行拥有近50%的自有债券。日本政府似乎决心在日元持有者发现日元根本就不稀缺，而且基本上一文不值之前，找出它能在多大程度上为日本经济提供融资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/viwV4BcmE-zkpHAGwWFPH.png?height=629&width=612)\n\n土耳其、阿根廷和委内瑞拉等发展中国家没有从强劲的经济或储备货币地位中受益，而是入不敷出地消费，遭受着令人震惊的高通胀和持久的货币危机，国民的生活状况逐年恶化。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eUeg72LGt5k3kluI34SRb.png?height=595&width=612)\n\n对于数十亿受制于不负责任的政府货币政策的个人来说，比特币为日益不稳定的基于法币的体系提供了一个潜在的、有吸引力的替代方案。\n\n\\*\\*最明显的，比特币提供了可以被确认的稀缺性。\\*\\*受益于可编程性，比特币被程序设定为只会存在2100万枚。由于区块链是去中心化的，因此没有人可以改变比特币的数量，没有政府可以降低单个比特币的购买力。如果有选择，很容易理解为什么有人会选择持有比特币等可证明稀缺的数字资产，而不是每年贬值两位数甚至三位数的当地货币。\n\n*译者注：单个比特币的购买力是指，无论何等情况下，1btc=1btc。而法定货币则不满足这个条件，如1950年的1美元无法与2022年的1美元对比，形容的是货币通胀带来的贬值。*\n\n实际上，加密货币的接受率最高的是发展中国家。根据Statista的说法，尼日利亚，越南和菲律宾是加密货币接受率最高的前三个国家，其中有32％的尼日利亚人使用或拥有加密货币。尼日利亚报道的通货膨胀率在过去十年中的通货膨胀率从10-20％不等。坦率地说，尼日利亚人的购买力每年都在减少10-20％。同时，比特币在过去十年中的购买力增加了数十倍。您更喜欢哪个经济系统？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ak0QoNKZNUmLHHjNNTqU5.png?height=714&width=612)\n\n显然，个人正在选择加密货币。也有越来越多的理由相信，在不久的将来，整个国家可能正在考虑传统资产的替代品，以保护他们的财富。\n\n今年2月，美国切断了俄罗斯的SWIFT系统。环球银行金融电讯协会是一个促进国际金融机构间贸易的全球支付网络。美国实际上切断了俄罗斯与全球贸易的主要技术基础设施的联系。为了进一步加大压力，今年夏天有消息称，欧盟正在研究禁止向俄罗斯进口黄金。\n\n从历史上看，由于政府相对稳定和强大的法律保护，美国主导的西方金融体系一直是最受信任的。黄金一直是黄金标准的储备资产：稀缺，表面上没有对手风险（黄金不会破产）。最近的事件向世界突出了在西方国家控制的体系中储存财富所固有的风险。越来越多的主要国家正在寻找替代方案。\n\n比特币有几个特性，这些特性使其成为纸币、主权债券和黄金等传统储备资产的有趣替代品。\n\n比特币是完全独立的，并且不存在对手方风险。比特币网络是由成千上万的个人在世界各地几十个国家运行网络的集合。一个国家所需要的只是一个节点和一个互联网连接，他们可以立即获取他们的财富。随着美元供应的增加，一个国家不需要像美国每年那样担心交易对手贬低其资产价值。一个国家不需要担心对手会像美国那样通过切断俄罗斯对 SWIFT 系统的访问权来消除他们对其财产的访问权。\n\n当前以法定货币为基础的范式被人类的不可靠性所困扰。从数学上看，永久性货币贬值的问题似乎会变得更糟。因此，个人面临着实际财富加速流失的风险。与此同时，各国正越来越清楚地意识到，参与美国控制的货币制度所带来的风险。加密货币，特别是比特币，为个人和国家提供了一种有趣的、可能越来越有吸引力的替代货币，以替代基于法币的货币体系。\n\n现在我们了解了法定系统及其货币固有的不可持续性，让我们来探讨一下金融系统的问题，这些问题在很大程度上没有得到重视，尤其是富裕阶层，这个系统对他们来说相对（更）好。\n\n### **金融体系的根本缺陷**\n\n大多数人可以理解比特币和 \"数字黄金 \"的吸引力，因为在量化宽松政策之后，人们对货币贬值的普遍认识已经提高。但富裕阶层真正难以理解的点在于：如何解释并理解以太坊和去中心化金融（\"DeFi\"）作为现有金融体系的替代品的潜力。现有的系统对大多数人来说运行良好，那么有什么需要改进的呢？\n\n现代金融体系的设计一直围绕着一个或多个可信的第三方的理念。你把你的钱放在摩根大通这样的银行里，并办理抵押贷款。你把股票存放在像嘉信理财这样的网上经纪公司。你用万事达信用卡支付杂货和其他必需品。你可以用现金应用(Cash App)或Venmo等金融应用程序支付账单或你的朋友。你可以通过像西联汇款这样的汇款供应商给你在海外的亲人汇款。这一切通常都很顺利。你有没有想过这样的安排会让你放弃什么？\n\n事实证明，很多。\n\n\\*\\*想一想，要获得这些服务需要付出什么。\\*\\*你需要提供关于自己的每一个细节。需要等待数天才能获得批准。如果你有不良信用，他们可以拒绝你。如果你不是美国公民，祝你好运，甚至可以开始了。假设你能够注册，你可能只能在某些狭窄的时间内获得服务，就像银行（9-5点，忘记周末和节假日）或经纪公司（市场时间）那样。\n\n\\*\\*然后是摩擦成本。\\*\\*想换一家经纪公司？想一想，转换经纪公司是多么痛苦。如果你要离开这个国家，你的银行或经纪人很可能会把你当成恐怖分子（说白了这不是他们的错，因为政府要求他们这样做）。如果你是一个商人，可能需要几天甚至几个月才能最终收到交易的资金。如果你是一个现金紧张的小企业，这非常不理想。\n\n\\*\\*最后的是成本问题。\\*\\*银行为持有你的钱而赚取2-3%的利差。他们付给你0%的钱，然后以3%、4%、甚至5%的价格把钱借出去。不错。像嘉信理财这样的经纪人从他们卖给你的共同基金或你存放在他们那里的证券中赚取利润。像Capital One这样的信用卡发行商和Visa这样的支付处理商从你的任何借记卡或信用卡交易中抽取2-3%。西联汇款公司（Western Union）等汇款机构对向美国境外汇款的特权收取5%以上的费用。\n\n为什么这一切要花这么多钱？因为这是寻租和信任的结合。银行从FDIC的保险补贴中获益，基本上确保了他们将成为存放现金的主要场所。在银行和政府的帮助下，支付处理商已经垄断了我们用来移动资金的技术渠道。各种政府法规和技术标准使国家之间的汇款变得复杂和昂贵，特别是小数额的汇款。我们相信这些系统主要是出于习惯，而没有质疑这种安排的必要性或成本。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y8CuDX_HLYNZ4-oaNaRYx.png?height=185&width=612)\n\n如果我们能创建一个拥有现有系统所有信任的系统，同时取消寻租，会怎么样？\n\n通过以太坊和其他启用智能合约的区块链，我们可以。\n\n今天，您可以将您的财富存储在以太坊区块链的数字钱包中，您可以在世界任何地方的任何时间访问该数字钱包。绝对没有银行工作时间、国界限制或其他不必要的摩擦成本。你所需要的只是一个互联网连接和一个像Chrome这样的浏览器。\n\n想从您的现金中赚取一些收益吗？前往Aave，一个去中心化的借贷市场，并存入一些资金。Aave目前在稳定币（即数字美元）上支付1-2%，同时只从储户赚取的收入中愁绪10-15%的薄利。祝银行好运，将来不得不与之竞争。\n\n想用你的一些现金换取另一个协议的代币吗？请到Uniswap购买一个有前途的新项目的代币。\n\n想贷款吗？前往MakerDAO，存入你的以太坊，并取出一些稳定币（即数字美元）。你可能会惊讶地发现，个人已经在互联网上完全不经允许地用他们的加密货币资产进行借贷，并购买现实世界的资产，如钢琴甚至房屋。\n\n想为一杯咖啡向商家付款？使用你在Solana区块链上的Phantom钱包与USDC稳定币，在几秒钟内支付给你当地的咖啡师，每笔交易不到1分钱。无需向信用卡公司支付3%的费用。没有几天甚至几周的时间来等待商家的资金到达。\n\n在上述所有的例子中，你可以。\n\n* 在几秒钟内访问它们，在世界任何地方。你只需要一个互联网连接，一个像Chrome这样的浏览器，以及一个MetaMask钱包就可以使用这些应用。不需要分享你的身份，也不需要等待别人来批准你。该服务在几秒钟内就能提供给你。\n* 即时结算。无需等待银行批准你的贷款或股票交易的结算。资金在几分钟内就能到你手中。\n* 这样做很便宜。目前在以太坊上的交易费用为1-2美元，使100美元以上的付款与信用卡竞争。可比的智能合约平台，如Solana或Polygon，甚至更便宜和更快，每笔交易成本为几美分。\n\n简而言之:基于区块链的系统更容易获得，成本更低，摩擦更小。更多的接入、更少的摩擦和更低的成本通常是技术领域的一个强大组合，就像互联网向传统行业展示的谷歌的广告和媒体，亚马逊的零售，或苹果的手机。\n\n在我们假设一个没有传统金融系统泥潭的乌托邦之前，重要的是要现实一点：该技术在准备进入黄金时代之前还有很长的路要走。目前的用户体验是糟糕的。在现实世界中，几乎不可能使用加密货币。监管部门对加密货币的处理仍然非常含糊。\n\n加密货币面临的最大挑战甚至可能不是技术，而是消费者行为。从使用第三方服务来管理你的财富到自我保管是一个巨大的转变。正如美国在线的150万付费客户会告诉你，消费者行为是超级粘性的。我不会指望婴儿潮一代会一头扎进一个基于区块链的公共金融系统。\n\n*译者注：婴儿潮一代是指1945-1965年，英国美国生育高峰出生的人。在这里指代old money那一时代的人。*\n\n但就像互联网的早期一样，加密货币代表了对现有金融系统的零到一的技术飞跃。消息正在传出：成千上万的软件开发人员涌入该领域，以利用这一潜在的千载难逢的机会：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6QUuY0pcR__pNvQ_p-XgZ.png?height=567&width=612)\n\n成千上万的企业家和越来越多的关注加密技术的人将解决加密技术的各种问题。随着问题被解决，个人可能会越来越多地继续选择进入加密货币金融系统，并砍掉主导现有金融系统的中间商。\n\n### 总结\n\n目前基于法币的系统总体上运行良好。每天都有数十亿人能够交换商品和服务。这个系统也很有粘性。政府要求以当地货币缴税等习惯和法规使得替代金融体系极不可能在一夜之间出现。\n\n更有可能发生的是，虽然比特币和以太坊等数字资产在全球净资产中的份额不断增加，但个人将会继续选择进入基于互联网的新经济。与现有系统相比，一个独立的、基于互联网的金融系统提供了太多的好处，我们不太可能在未来很多年内继续看到加密货币的更大应用。\n\n*译者注：作者是将金融体系分为三个类，分别是传统金融，互联网金融以及去中心化金融。此段意思是，受制于去中心化金融的糟糕体验，更多人会选择进入互联网金融。*\n\n此外，还有投机周期。加密货币资产类别是有史以来表现最好的。比特币在过去十年里每年上涨230%。以太坊自2014年首次代币发行以来，涨幅超过2,000倍。但财富从传统的基于法币的金融体系中转移出来的时间仍然很早。加密货币总市值为0.9万亿美元，而全球资产约为500万亿美元。从长期来看，特别是随着世界变得越来越数字化，世界可能会集体将其财富的1-10%或更多储存在加密货币资产中，这并不是一个夸张的想法。未来的加密货币周期将继续推动技术发展，并吸引新一批寻求风险的冒险家（例如：我，是2021年的学生）。\n\n因此，即使现有的系统对你来说运行良好，而且你是一个加密货币怀疑论者，你也有必要了解和欣赏加密货币作为一种可能比互联网更大的技术浪潮。在未来几十年里，加密货币可能只会越来越强大。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i6E1yyHpat5NHhAa_UFKL.png?height=932&width=612)\n\n作者：柳叶惊鸿\n\n公众号：维斯曼笔记\n\n个人微信号：liuyejinghong_\n\nRSS3个人主页：liuye.rss3.bio\n\nETH打赏地址：liuyejinghong.eth\n\nDiscord：https://discord.gg/6tu2hpwvUh\\\\\n\n![]()\n\n公众号后台回复“**web3**”免费领取web3学习资源\n\n公众号后台回复“**行业报告**”免费领取2022行业报告\n\n公众号后台回复“**DID**”免费领取去中心化身份行业报告\n\n维斯曼笔记现已开放微信社群，在公众号菜单栏中获取二维码。\n\n往期内容推荐：\n\n《[45.熊市漫谈之三：Web3的真正变革点在于提升体验，Uniswap是最好的案例](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg5ODIwNjk3Mg==&mid=2247484502&idx=1&sn=3849bf1e2bd9287a89a894199877797e&chksm=c06759c5f710d0d3b6b1488dd6c9b798bba7b926e83748d71e83a0e6094c8cbf7d95c8ca883e&scene=21#wechat_redirect)》\n\n《[44.数据安全促使去中心化身份（DID）成为下一风口赛道，基于Web3

なにから始めたらいいのか\n\nNFTの相場全体としては厳しい相場だった中で力強い動きが目立っている [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) なかなか仕組みとか入り口が分かりにくい（自分もそうでした）と思うので、もっといろんな人が興味を持ったらいいなという思いで紹介をしてみようと思います。記事の内容はNFAであり売買をするときはDYORでよろしくお願いします\n\n言いたいことがいっぱいあるのですごい長くなる予感がしますが、それでは始めてみます\n\n# Art Blocksとは\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8bUcwFzTtqlZOglaPFar.png?height=217&width=811)\n\nArt Blocksとはなにかについてまずは[公式のサイト](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)にある創業者のSnowfro（Chromie Squiggleの作者）の言葉で始めてみます\n\n> Art Blocksは、イーサリアム・ブロックチェーン上に不変に保存される、プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツに焦点を当てた、これまでにないタイプのプラットフォームです。\n>\n> 好きなコレクションを選び、作品の代金を支払うと、アルゴリズムによってランダムに生成されたバージョンのコンテンツが作成され、あなたのイーサリアムアカウントに送られます。出来上がった作品は、静止画像であったり、3Dモデルであったり、インタラクティブな体験であったりします。出力はそれぞれ異なり、プラットフォーム上で作成できるコンテンツの種類には無限の可能性があります。\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/learn](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)\n\nアーティストはコレクションを生み出すコードを登録し、購入者がサイトからmintをするとトランザクションごとに、コードに組み込まれたランダムな要素が組み合わさって一定の共通のスタイルであるけれどもそれぞれが異なる作品を生み出すプラットフォームがArt Blocksです。すでに存在している作品から選ぶのではなくmintに参加することでコレクターが作品を生み出す体験ができることが魅力の1つだと思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートに興味がない、NFT ARTに興味がない人でもArt Blocksのことはなんとなく聞いたことがある（からこの記事を読んでいると思いますが）人はそれなりにいると思います。それはArt BlocksがすでにNFTの1つのジャンルを代表するブランドになっているからだと思います。\n\n今後NFTの世界がより広がり多くの新しい人たちが入ってきたときにもアートの入り口として存在しているなら、人々をひきつける作品を継続的に生み出すプラットフォームとしてNFTの世界でのアートのカテゴリでのブランドであり続けているかもしれないと思います。\n\nArt Blocksの魅力、可能性についてZenecaが熱く語っている記事が2つ、またCoincheck NFTでArt Blocksを購入できるので、Coincheckの紹介記事も分かりやすいのでので合わせてどうぞ\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks)\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2)\n\n[https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494](https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494)\n\n# Generative Artとは\n\nArt Blocksの紹介の中に出てきた「プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツ」＝**ジェネラティブアート**にそもそもなんで高い値段がつくのか分からない、という人も多いと思います（自分もそうでした）\n\nジェネラティブアートがなにかについては入門記事として必ず名前が出る「ジェネラティブアートを愛する理由」という記事が素晴らしいので、Art Blocksに興味があれば時間のある時にぜひ読んでみてほしいです。\n\n[https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/](https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/)\n\nいくつか自分が記事を読んでなるほどなー、と思ってジェネラティブアートは良いぞ！と思うに至ったポイントなどを引用を交えつつ簡単にまとめてみます。\n\n### ジェネラティブ・アートは20世紀美術の中心的テーマの拡張\n\n> 幾何学的、抽象化、偶然性は、ジェネラティブ・アートに限らず、20世紀のあらゆるアートにとって主要なテーマです。以下のような主題がこれらはコンピューターを使っていない20世紀初頭の作品から強く感じることが出来て、ジェネラティブアートとつながっていることを強く感じることが出来ます。\n\n* 分析的キュビスムにおける幾何学の破壊\n* 未来派、構成主義、バウハウスにはじまるテクノロジー重視、マシン美学、機械化された生産\n* ダダ、シュルレアリスム、抽象表現主義における自律と偶然の導入\n* 新造形主義、シュプレマティスム、ハード・エッジ、オプ・アートの非比喩的美学、力強い幾何学、鮮明な色使い\n* ソル・ルウィットらによるアルゴリズムの使用\n\n![左から、Circles in a Circle – Wassily Kandinsky, 1923、Highway and Byways – Paul Klee, 1928、Suprematist Composition – Kasimir Malevich, 1916　今のジェネラティブアートに通じるものを強く感じます](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQJNTIr4szr7UXa0L-yvQ.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\n> 一方でジェネラティブアートの定義として\n>\n> **「ジェネラティブアートとは、コンピュータを使い、創造のプロセスの一部に意図的に偶然性を取り入れたプログラムで作られたアートのことである。」**\n>\n> とされますが、2つの間違った見方をよくされることがあります。\n\n### よくある誤解・その1\n\nアーティストは創作のプロセス全体を完全に制御していて、プログラムは常に書かれた通りに実行されるだけである。それゆえジェネラティブアートは、たとえ人間的で親しみやすいものだったとしても、偶然性、偶発性、発見性、自発性を欠いている。\n\n### よくある誤解・その2\n\nアーティストはまったく制御することなく、自律的なマシンがランダムにデザインを生成しているだけである。コンピュータがアートを作っていて、人間は制作者には値しない。本当のアートとはいえないのだから。\n\nジェネラティブアートは作品に導入する偶然性を丁寧にコントロールされています。秩序の中の偶然性、と聞くと人の手が入らないあらゆる自然の中にあるものを思い浮かべます。受け取り方は人それぞれだと思いますがジェネラティブアートを見ていて時々はっとした気持ちになって心を奪われるのはそういう側面もあるのかな、と思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートは現代のアートの一つの形であり、NFT、Cryptoの外の世界にも存在するものなので、NFT外のアートに関心がある人たちにとっては特殊なものではなく受け入れやすいアートの形式なのかもしれません。\n\n# Art Blocksの仕組み\n\nだいぶ話が飛躍しましたがArt Blocksの紹介に戻ります。\n\n![左からFidenza、Ringers、Archetype](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TdQfBj9BkM47n1SZ5VVYq.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\nArt

なにから始めたらいいのか\n\nNFTの相場全体としては厳しい相場だった中で力強い動きが目立っている [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) なかなか仕組みとか入り口が分かりにくい（自分もそうでした）と思うので、もっといろんな人が興味を持ったらいいなという思いで紹介をしてみようと思います。記事の内容はNFAであり売買をするときはDYORでよろしくお願いします\n\n言いたいことがいっぱいあるのですごい長くなる予感がしますが、それでは始めてみます\n\n# Art Blocksとは\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8bUcwFzTtqlZOglaPFar.png?height=217&width=811)\n\nArt Blocksとはなにかについてまずは[公式のサイト](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)にある創業者のSnowfro（Chromie Squiggleの作者）の言葉で始めてみます\n\n> Art Blocksは、イーサリアム・ブロックチェーン上に不変に保存される、プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツに焦点を当てた、これまでにないタイプのプラットフォームです。\n>\n> 好きなコレクションを選び、作品の代金を支払うと、アルゴリズムによってランダムに生成されたバージョンのコンテンツが作成され、あなたのイーサリアムアカウントに送られます。出来上がった作品は、静止画像であったり、3Dモデルであったり、インタラクティブな体験であったりします。出力はそれぞれ異なり、プラットフォーム上で作成できるコンテンツの種類には無限の可能性があります。\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/learn](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)\n\nアーティストはコレクションを生み出すコードを登録し、購入者がサイトからmintをするとトランザクションごとに、コードに組み込まれたランダムな要素が組み合わさって一定の共通のスタイルであるけれどもそれぞれが異なる作品を生み出すプラットフォームがArt Blocksです。すでに存在している作品から選ぶのではなくmintに参加することでコレクターが作品を生み出す体験ができることが魅力の1つだと思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートに興味がない、NFT ARTに興味がない人でもArt Blocksのことはなんとなく聞いたことがある（からこの記事を読んでいると思いますが）人はそれなりにいると思います。それはArt BlocksがすでにNFTの1つのジャンルを代表するブランドになっているからだと思います。\n\n今後NFTの世界がより広がり多くの新しい人たちが入ってきたときにもアートの入り口として存在しているなら、人々をひきつける作品を継続的に生み出すプラットフォームとしてNFTの世界でのアートのカテゴリでのブランドであり続けているかもしれないですね。\n\nArt Blocksの魅力、可能性についてZenecaが熱く語っている記事が2つ、またCoincheck NFTでArt Blocksを購入できるので、Coincheckの紹介記事も分かりやすいのでので合わせてどうぞ\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks)\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2)\n\n[https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494](https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494)\n\n# Generative Artとは\n\nArt Blocksの紹介の中に出てきた「プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツ」＝**ジェネラティブアート**にそもそもなんで高い値段がつくのか分からない、という人も多いと思います（自分もそうでした）\n\nジェネラティブアートがなにかについては入門記事として必ず名前が出る「ジェネラティブアートを愛する理由」という記事が素晴らしいので、Art Blocksに興味があれば時間のある時にぜひ読んでみてほしいです。\n\n[https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/](https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/)\n\nいくつか自分が記事を読んでなるほどなー、と思ってジェネラティブアートは良いぞ！と思うに至ったポイントなどを引用を交えつつ簡単にまとめてみます。\n\n### ジェネラティブ・アートは20世紀美術の中心的テーマの拡張\n\n> 幾何学的、抽象化、偶然性は、ジェネラティブ・アートに限らず、20世紀のあらゆるアートにとって主要なテーマです。以下のような主題がこれらはコンピューターを使っていない20世紀初頭の作品から強く感じることが出来て、ジェネラティブアートとつながっていることを強く感じることが出来ます。\n\n* 分析的キュビスムにおける幾何学の破壊\n* 未来派、構成主義、バウハウスにはじまるテクノロジー重視、マシン美学、機械化された生産\n* ダダ、シュルレアリスム、抽象表現主義における自律と偶然の導入\n* 新造形主義、シュプレマティスム、ハード・エッジ、オプ・アートの非比喩的美学、力強い幾何学、鮮明な色使い\n* ソル・ルウィットらによるアルゴリズムの使用\n\n![左から、Circles in a Circle – Wassily Kandinsky, 1923、Highway and Byways – Paul Klee, 1928、Suprematist Composition – Kasimir Malevich, 1916　今のジェネラティブアートに通じるものを強く感じます](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQJNTIr4szr7UXa0L-yvQ.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\n> 一方でジェネラティブアートの定義として\n>\n> **「ジェネラティブアートとは、コンピュータを使い、創造のプロセスの一部に意図的に偶然性を取り入れたプログラムで作られたアートのことである。」**\n>\n> とされますが、2つの間違った見方をよくされることがあります。\n\n### よくある誤解・その1\n\nアーティストは創作のプロセス全体を完全に制御していて、プログラムは常に書かれた通りに実行されるだけである。それゆえジェネラティブアートは、たとえ人間的で親しみやすいものだったとしても、偶然性、偶発性、発見性、自発性を欠いている。\n\n### よくある誤解・その2\n\nアーティストはまったく制御することなく、自律的なマシンがランダムにデザインを生成しているだけである。コンピュータがアートを作っていて、人間は制作者には値しない。本当のアートとはいえないのだから。\n\nジェネラティブアートは作品に導入する偶然性を丁寧にコントロールされています。秩序の中の偶然性、と聞くと人の手が入らないあらゆる自然の中にあるものを思い浮かべます。受け取り方は人それぞれだと思いますがジェネラティブアートを見ていて時々はっとした気持ちになって心を奪われるのはそういう側面もあるのかな、と思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートは現代のアートの一つの形であり、NFT、Cryptoの外の世界にも存在するものなので、NFT外のアートに関心がある人たちにとっては特殊なものではなく受け入れやすいアートの形式なのかもしれません。\n\n# Art Blocksの仕組み\n\nだいぶ話が飛躍しましたがArt Blocksの紹介に戻ります。\n\n![左からFidenza、Ringers、Archetype](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TdQfBj9BkM47n1SZ5VVYq.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\nArt Blocksは”Curated”、”Factory”、”Playground”という３つのカテゴリーに分かれています。\n\n### Curated\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?section=curated](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?section=curated)\n\n* Art Blocksの審査を経てリリースされる作品。月に1つぐらいのペースでmintされる\n* Chromie Squiggle、Fidenza、Ringers、など有名でフロアが高い作品はCuretedのものが多い\n* ダッチオークションのスタート価格も高い\n\n###

Where true Michelangelos and da Vincis drive progress through their talents without struggling for food and proving themselves all their lives to get a chance to be recognized posthumously? If so, I’m with you.\n\n> *Though creativity has existed as long as humanity, we started to discuss it as the new economic paradigm not so long ago. What’s more, now we even talk about it in the Web3 dimension.*\n\nTo better understand what it is, first, let’s walk through the backstory of the creator economy. How did we actually arrive here? Often, looking back at the past is a great way to get real insights into what is happening today.\n\nIt won’t make you yawn, I promise 😉.\n\n## The backstory of the Creator Economy\n\nThe transition to the creator economy has been long-incoming and uneven. Now let’s explore the major economic and social development shifts that eventually brought us there.\n\n### 1. From the Agrarian to the Industrial Economy\n\nIn the mid-18th century, we got the Industrial Revolution that led to the jump from agriculture to manufacturing. That was when the industrial economy started, and it continued until World War II.\n\n> *The main task of the industrial economy was to produce more goods that would be accessible and affordable for a broader category of people.*\n\nUnlike today’s overabundant reality, goods were scarce and not easily accessible at that time.\n\nTo achieve its goals, industrialization triggered significant economic changes, shifting the power from agrarians to manufacturers, with the latter having become the center of the new economic reality. Industrialization also brought the culture of hard work, competition, and development of new ideas primarily related to the stuff production and automation processes. That was what creative minds were focusing on those days.\n\nIt doesn’t mean there was no place for pure creative activities, like music, writing, or painting, in those days. However, they definitely were not number one on the agenda. Artists just kept going on their own. The creative field wasn’t seen as a separate economic subset deserving some special attention.\n\n### 2. From the Industrial to the Consumer Economy\n\nThe post-World War II period was a time when manufacturers started producing more goods than people wanted to buy. Stuff was no longer scarce.\n\n> *The economy got a new challenge: to make a customer wish to buy what the market constantly offered.*\n\nTherefore, the industrial economic paradigm started getting replaced with the consumer one. Customers (or consumers) had become the central actor of the new economic reality, having replaced manufacturers.\n\nAmong other crucial players who came onto the scene were salesmen, marketers and mass media (TV, radio, newspapers, etc.). The primary job of the first two was to ensure that consumers keep buying, while mass media heavily stimulated the demand for goods, set trends, and shaped attitudes toward almost everything.\n\nAlso, mass media gave rise to phenomena such as pop culture, at the core of which were the production and distribution of creative products geared toward a mass audience. Pop culture was facilitated by the so-called cultural industries that included design, printing, publishing, multi-media, audio-visual, cinematographic productions, etc.\n\n`Unlike the industrial economy, the consumer paradigm brought a tremendous variety of creative jobs and activities. However, creativity, in general, was limited by a major requirement: It had to sell well to the masses.`\n\nHerewith most creators were the employees of corporations.\n\nCreating and growing your audience and earning a living from that were quite challenging tasks.\n\nAs [Paul Saffo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Saffo) fairly mentioned, you could be known only if you were a journalist or worked on TV. Creators who wanted to let the world know about them were always dependent on the discretion of producers, publishing agencies, and other kinds of gatekeepers. To make those guys like you was a necessary prerequisite. Fortune was the most reliable strategy here.\n\n### 3. From the Consumer to the Creative Economy\n\nIn the 1990s, the consumer economy shifted to its *digitization* phase. A huge spectrum of economic segments started transforming with IT solutions. This new economic digital environment launched the demand for a new type of creativity — an innovative and digital one.\n\nSometime later, governments of different states started to officially declare creativity as a “`valuable asset that creates wealth and employs.`” They also injected a new concept of the “**creative industries**” and the umbrella term for them the “**creative economy**” (not creator!) and tasked themselves with providing regulatory and financial support for the latter to strive. Among the first countries that did this were Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the core of the creative economy concept were individual talent, innovation and exploitation of intellectual property. The spectrum it covered was pretty similar to one of the mentioned cultural industries — design, writing, audio, video content, etc. However, in the case of the creative economy, those activities had to be IT-powered.\n\n> *The new challenge here was to bring innovations into most economic segments and satisfy the demand for new digital products and services.*\n\nDespite that the term “creative economy” can make us think about some artist-centered paradise, in fact, like the consumer economy, it was primarily aimed at serving consumer needs. \n\nIt didn’t offer the creators any new groundbreaking ways for turning their talent into independent entrepreneurship. Instead, the creative economy was more about “creativity by employment” rather than stimulating creators to succeed on their own terms.\n\n### 4. From the creative to the Creator Economy\n\nThe next economic shift happened when giant IT platforms such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and the like came onto the scene and started competing with the traditional mass media.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6XSMcnBMJGBMeEQo0-zln.png?height=727&width=1400)\n\nDuring the global financial crisis in 2008, these platforms had become so popular that traditional mass media were getting left behind. People began to live on them and use them as the primary sources of information, knowledge, and networking. ***That was a digital media revolution***. **And that was where the creator economy began.**\n\n> *The task of the new economic paradigm was to convert customers through engagement and participation. Unlike the consumer economy, where customers just bought what was offered, the creator economy enabled them to participate, interact and add value. It also unlocked the tools for promoting themselves as “products” and monetizing on that.*\n\nWriters, musicians, painters, and other types of creators got a tremendous path to promote themselves and reach out to their fans. Instead of pleasing old-fashioned gatekeepers (producers, casting managers, publishers, etc.) to give them a chance, now they can easily use the power of the platforms to share their creativity and find their fans. The barriers were negated.\n\nGenerally speaking, not only professional creators could do it. Everyone with a laptop and an internet connection can now get a chance to try themselves as creators.\n\n# What does the Creator Economy mean in 2022?\n\nAs there is no academically shaped definition for the modern creator economy yet, we can allow some freestyle here:\n\n> ***Conceptually, the current (or Web2) creator economy is an online economic segment powered by a set of interactive digital platforms, marketplaces and tools that enable users to access and create content, as well as monetize it.***\n\nThe creator economy implies no entry barriers or casting. All you need is to sign up and follow platforms’ terms and conditions. Here is the trick: When you use a platform, its algorithm aggregates some of your data and tracks you in some manner. This is the payment for participation.\n\nThe platforms provide you with a variety of tools for content creation, design, and distribution through ads. The latter is the main income source of platforms.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PWD7qikQ21G38mOJX2Qxc.png?height=997&width=1400)\n\nAnother achievement of the creator economy is that it unlocked a wide variety of ways of monetizing work for creators. If in the previous economic paradigms an artist could earn primarily through selling or licensing their IP rights, they can also do it through advertising, tipping, brand sponsorship, affiliate links, streaming, and many other digital marketing activities.\n\nEven if your content is originally not digital, you can still use platforms to advertise your work, engage and convert your audience, find different ways of collaboration, and so on. The sky’s the limit here. However, some cut of your income always goes to a platform (well, a huge one).\n\n> *To sum up, the main goal of the creator economy is to empower the online entrepreneurship of creators by providing them with digital marketing tools and removing any barriers or discrimination.*\n\nSPOILER: The barriers are still there. They are just different. We will look at them closely in the next articles.\n\n# Why do we need to upgrade the creator economy for Web3?\n\nI could probably answer this question by giving a massive list of problems of the current creator economy that have driven us to consider its Web3 upgrade.\n\nHowever, I believe that the primary reason is not in these problems. It is **the mentality shift** that eventually made us spot these problems and realize that there could be a better alternative reality without them.\n\nThe main catalyst for this mentality shift was crypto. It infected us with the ideas of disintermediation, independence from third-party service providers, 100% data ownership and self-sovereignty. Crypto has generated a new way of thinking and caused us to look at ordinary things through entirely different lenses.\n\nInitially applied in finance, crypto’s disruptive mission has spread to many other economic subsets. Now we call it the ***Web3 movement***. And the Web3 creator economy is a special case.\n\nHere is the essence of the Web3 economy concept:\n\n* Eliminating intermediary platforms between creators and their fans.\n* Creator’s owning 100% of their data, brand, and work.\n* Transparency of business processes and money-making.\n* Stimulating authentic creativity instead of ad-driven content production.\n\nI will break this down in the following articles — so stick with me. We will also detail the current creator economy problems and see what kind of solutions Web3 has cooked up for us.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nTo sum up, the creator economy is that organic evolution stage that we’ve come to after passing through all those social developments and economic shifts described herein.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k9iYYE_y-RQWTKXBD8DA-.png?height=896&width=1400)\n\nThe upcoming Web3 paradigm of the creator economy aims to enable creators to build their own independent “open economy” where they can co-own it with their fans and directly monetize it without looking to any third party.\n\nAs some field experts assume, if this model succeeds, **we will enter a new era of wealth generation** where creators will no longer be just the products. Instead, they will become new economies. \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1658034795, "digest": "tolIEQuEOG6Kmzq3QZj-XXKhNN5vyBGSCqmdZeQCC5c", "contributor": "0x17061AC3F0648C2d5fc5a078e3E722d7cF26EcDD"}

Then, I lost my interest due to market crash. After the COVID crash in whole markets, I started to research crypto projects again. Some projects' names were familiar but I heard novel projects and very attractive new terms such as *Layer1*, *DeFi*, *AMM*, *DEX*. I was so curious in these terms. The idea of decentralized applications made me super excited.\n\n### Diving into DeFi Projects\n\nThe Youtube video about Avalanche made me thrilled and I decided to make an investment in ICO of Avalanche. My knowledge was very limited, I even set-up my crypto wallet (Metamask) other people's help. After the investment, I followed up Avalanche and its ecosystem closely.\n\nProjects had started to launch on Avalanche network (Layer1 term had become more meaningful in my mind.). I had used almost every project's applications (let's called in right term, *dApp*) and took part in communities of these projects. Then, I realized that collaborative work and contributing are the main key in this industry.\n\nDo you want to take part in a project? Then, be *active* and *contribute*. It's that simple. I got my jobs (in position of community manager/moderator) in DeFi in that way, without any job application.\n\nAt that point, I decided to learn more about the technical side in order to **be a creator, not just user**.\n\n### Researchs for being developer\n\nThere are tons of amazing resources about Web3 development. I listed some of them, all is free!\n\n* [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/): Choose project and learn by doing.\n* [UseWeb3](https://www.useweb3.xyz/): Books, challenges, courses, guides, tutorials about Web3.\n* [LearnWeb3](https://www.learnweb3.io/): Cover all topics related to blockchain A->Z. Doesn't even know what blockchain is? No problem, you learn all of them.\n* [Nader Dabit's Blog](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-ethereum-development-3j13) and Youtube Videos: He is a legend. He has many blog posts and videos about becoming developer in Web3 industry.\n* [Patrick Collins's Amazing 32-Hour Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ): Another legend. He published a course that covers all topics about full stack Web3 development.\n* [CryptoZombie](https://cryptozombies.io/): Learn about smart contracts in Solidity and having fun.\n\n### Which path I chose?\n\nTo clarify, I use some programming languages in my daily job and personal works but I'm not a developer yet. I have some HTML+CSS knowledge but never used JavaScript which is very crucial language to know in this industry.\n\nI had completed *CryptoZombie* to learn about Solidity firstly. It has several steps and helped me a lot about Solidity. But my main goal is not just to write smart contracts, it's being full stack Web3 developer. So, I realized that I need much more organized course. Due to their classification teaching method, I go with **LearnWeb3**.\n\n![LearnWeb3 Track](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656157244188/QbFYfWFsj.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)\n\n### LearnWeb3 Freshman\n\nFreshman section of LearnWeb3 covers essential topics. I'm already familiar with blockchain and crypto related terms, but as I said before, I need to learn Javascript and React JS very well. So, I study both these topics and Javascript simultaneously.\n\n> *Basic Programming, What is Blockchain?, What is Web3, What is ETH, Crypto Wallets, Remix IDE, Solidity, dApp, Cryptocurrency, and NFT are topics of Freshman section.*\n\n### Learning Javascript\n\nThere are some additional resources/links in each topics on LearnWeb3. They suggest two courses on Scrimba which is also awesome website to learn about web development.\n\n1. [Learn Javascript for Free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) by *Per Harald Borgen*\n2. [Learn React for Free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) by *Bob Ziroll*\n\nI have just completed the course about Javascript today. It is interactive and very instructive course. Scrimba's Discord server is also very helpful and friendly place to ask if you have an issue. I definitely would recommend it to everyone who wants to learn Javascript.\n\n### What's next?\n\nI will start to learn React and continue my other courses in LearnWeb3 at the same time. After that, if I feel comfortable about Javascript and React enough, my next course will be Patrick Collins's awesome course.\n\nLastly, I would like to thank [Per Harald Borgen](https://twitter.com/perborgen) and [Eda](https://twitter.com/edatweets_) to encourage me about writing my journey. They didn't encourage me in personal, they don't even know me but their thoughts encourage me.\n\nI hope that I can continue to write my journey as it makes progress. If you also want to learn about Web3 development, let's keep in touch.

But **Mirror** is quickly changing that. In this guide, we’re going to dive into **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** - **a web3 toolkit for sharing stories, funding ideas, and turning text-based content into NFTs** - and publish an entry on Mirror of our own!\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we begin, let’s make sure you have your gear in order. To mint an entry on Mirror, all you’ll need is an Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow.\n\n*If you need help getting set up, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w).** There, you’ll find a guide for **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)!***\n\n## NFTs & Mirror\n\nWhile today’s most popular NFTs are image-based, pictures are just a fraction of what NFTs are capable of. At their core, **NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are simply proofs of ownership written on a blockchain**. These proofs of ownership represent an asset, digital or physical, and link it to an individual's blockchain address. The result is a publicly verifiable file, showing a certain thing owned by a certain person.\n\nSo, can an article be an NFT? Absolutely!\n\nAt first glance, **Mirror** may just look like a web3 platform for publishing and monetizing articles — something like a blockchain-based Medium or Substack. But under the hood, Mirror is a powerful tool for creating content and building communities. It gives you everything you need for minting NFTs, crowdfunding, splitting proceeds from sales, and even minting ERC20 tokens to distribute to new community members.\n\n**Today, we’re going to write our first Mirror articles and publish them as NFTs.

Proof），对其大胆、明确、一针见血的风格非常欣赏。彼得·D·希夫与安德鲁·J·希夫合作的这本《小岛经济学》具有同样鲜明的风格。愿这部著作让更多的读者从中受益。\n时寒冰珍藏版序言\n自《小岛经济学》一书问世以来，已有4年之久。4年来，我们始终与读者保持交流，与他们探讨如何运用书中理论来稳定美国及其他国家持续动荡的经济，这也是本书写作的初衷。然而时至今日，我们仍旧觉得自己尚有未尽之言，未尽之责。\n本书第1版写作手法幽默，内容浅显易懂，有关鱼的双关比喻也算生动，但在品质方面仍有所欠缺。另外，第1版也有造作之嫌，貌似我们想利用低廉的价格吸引那些对经济学原理不够了解的读者，以此获得庞大的读者市场。但现在，我们坚信许多忠实的读者正满心期待这本书有一个更加细致完善的新版本，更有许多读者可能会将本书作为礼物赠人，或者作为展示摆放在咖啡桌上，因此我们由衷地希望能将本书打造成馈赠佳品、阅读精品。\n由此，我们决定推出本书的“珍藏版”。这个版本比第1版内容更丰富，也更翔实。我们对新版的扉页做了美化处理，在书中加入了一些新插图，纸张的质量也有了提高，比第1版更平整更光滑。在写作模式上，新版基本延续了第1版的故事书的形式，我们始终觉得这样的形式与本书的精神最为契合。上述只是本书包装上的改进，除此之外，我们还在内容上做了许多增补。\n本书第1版问世之时，正值美国经济近乎完全崩溃一年之后。自那时起，形势已经有了明显好转。时至今日，我们不再整天报道低迷的GDP增长，房地产市场呈现回暖态势（一些市场的价格正以前所未有的速度攀升），股票市场不断创造历史新高，通货膨胀貌似又回到可控范围内，失业率也在稳步下降。但与此同时，大多数美国人对这些所谓的“经济复苏”并没有什么特别的好感。\n随着通货膨胀的加剧，美国中等收入家庭在2013年8月的收入比2008年经济大萧条开始前还要低。当时越来越多的人面临失业，或者只能做兼职工作，然而他们真正想要的是一份全职工作。但那些新出现的全职工作，更多的是在低薪的零售业或服务业，而非待遇优厚的中产阶层岗位，这些岗位正日趋减少。今天的大学毕业生正面临着史上最为惨淡的就业前景，即便毕业时负债累累，他们也没有理由得到好的岗位。\n在当下的美国社会，人们旅游和度假的花销越来越少，更多的工资都拿来买生活必需品（食物与能源）了。如今美国马路上飞驰的汽车，全都是老得不能再老的旧款式，曾经代表着美国经济实力的龙头城市底特律，如今也惨遭破产厄运。这一切，绝非偶然。\n我们听到的总是经济正在复苏的消息，实际上却面临着令人失望的前景，所闻与现实之间根本就是天壤之别。这是因为在2008年金融危机之后，为避免承担更大的损失，联邦政府开始花费我们实际并没有的数万亿美元，美联储也开始实施一项名为“量化宽松”的新政策。这些政策已经成为实体经济的替代品。\n10年前，除了在大学经济系之外，几乎没有人听过“量化宽松”这个名词；时至今日，这一政策已成为经济增长最重要的推手。众多投资者与财经新闻工作者近乎痴迷地紧跟联邦政府这一政策，就像14岁的校园女生追随着她们最爱的男孩乐队（Boy Band）一样。美联储主席本·伯南克仿佛已变身为加拿大流行音乐小天王贾斯汀·比伯（Justin Bieber），备受追捧。\n然而，量化宽松不过是“印钞票”的一种花哨的委婉说法而已。自2010年起，美联储凭空印发了数万亿美元用来购买资产，包括政府支持的债券和抵押贷款债券。这些做法抬高了相关市场的价格，降低了长期利率。美联储正利用印钞机的力量创造一个经济复苏的假象。但这种创造出来的经济和作为其支撑的那些印刷的钞票一样，都是假象。在这种如履薄冰的健康假象之下，经济发展甚至比美联储采取补救措施之前还要惨不忍睹。\n举例来说，在我们准备推出《小岛经济学》一书的新版本之际，美联储也在购买每月450亿美元的国债，占据了政府发行的所有债券的大部分。这一举措使得长期利率保持在较低水平，从而在某种程度上推动了经济发展。美联储鼓励公司和个人借贷，不支持他们储蓄。极低的利率也是近几年推动股票市场迅猛发展的主要原因。如果美联储停止购买债券，利率便会立即飙升，股票会暴跌，看上去健康的经济也会消失不见。\n量化宽松政策对房地产行业的复兴也有直接的影响。美联储每月购买400亿美元的抵押贷款债券，实际上相当于已经认购了房地产市场。但美联储所购买的抵押贷款，是个人买家出于合理原因根本不愿意碰触的。房价仍然与收入高度相关，大多数买房者没有足够的储蓄来支付巨额的首付款。但政府的担保人只需要支付最低首付款，再加上有美联储提供的超低利率，支付相对轻松很多。假如没有这些支持，房地产市场毫无疑问会像2008年金融危机时一样崩溃失衡。\n因此，量化宽松政策已经成为美国的经济命脉这一说法并不为过。但问题在于，这一政策诱惑性极大，最终会毒发不治。我们实现了基于量化宽松政策的人为经济复苏，这种复苏也只能与该政策同生共灭，并不能为真正的经济复苏奠定基础。\n目前，主流经济学家都在讨论，在不损害经济发展的前提下，美联储会在何时、以怎样的方式摒弃量化宽松政策（即所谓的“退出策略”）。尽管多数人承认实施“退出策略”会遇到重重阻力，但他们仍然相信，手段高明的执行者会以极其灵敏精确的方式完成这项任务。这就好比一个古老的戏法：将桌布从一张摆满东西的桌子上猛地抽走，桌上的瓷器却纹丝不动。但这还不是美联储要表演的戏法。实际上，美联储要抽走的不是桌布，而是桌子本身。他们希望既能撤走桌子，又不让那张桌布和那些餐具掉落地上。\n这就是我们认为当前经济已经陷入困境的理由。我们痴迷于量化宽松政策，却并不了解它，而经济学家期待的量化宽松“退出策略”则永远也不会出炉。这是一条不归路，只会带来更为严重的经济问题。\n鉴于这些新情况的出现，《小岛经济学》的珍藏版增加了两个新章节——第十七章和第十八章——旨在揭秘量化宽松政策（以及欧洲债务危机的最新进展）。另外，我们还对全书做了几处编辑，同时还增加了部分奖励内容。希望新增的内容会使本书与我们当下所处的这个世界联系更加紧密。\n希望你们能喜欢本书，并与那些需要回归理性的朋友们分享。\n彼得·D·希夫与安德鲁·J·希夫\n2013年9月序言\n在过去大约一个世纪的时间里，很多研究成果向人类呈现了科技进步的巨大成就，涵盖所有研究领域——只有一个领域除外。\n凭借数学和物理这两大武器，科学家们将一艘宇宙飞船发射到距地球几亿公里\\[1\\]之外的土星的一颗卫星上。而“经营惨淡”的经济学界却找不到一个类似的成就。\n如果美国国家航空航天局的工程师们具有与我们那些顶级经济学家相同的预测能力，“伽利略号”探测器的结局也许会截然不同。不但卫星会脱离其轨道，而且火箭在升空过程中转而向下俯冲的可能性极大，甚至有可能冲破地壳，冲到岩浆层去。\n2007年，当世界聚焦几十年来最大的一次经济灾难时，绝大多数经济学家并没有意识到棘手的问题已显露端倪。此后三年里经济一片混乱，经济学家们拿出的补救方案令大多数人瞠目：为了解决债务危机，我们必须负债更多；为了经济繁荣，我们必须花钱消费。过去他们缺乏远见，而今他们的解决方案又如此违背常识，究其原因，是因为几乎没有经济学家明白他们的学科如何发挥作用。\n凯恩斯创造了许多被普遍接受的理论，其中就包括上述那些荒谬的建议。凯恩斯是20世纪早期非常有头脑的英国学者，但他却提出了一些非常愚蠢的理论来分析经济增长的原因。从根本上说，凯恩斯只不过是玩了一个聪明的把戏而已，他把一件简单的事情搞得极其复杂。\n在凯恩斯的时代，物理学家们首次提出了量子力学的概念。量子力学是研究微观粒子运动规律的物理学分支学科，它认为宇宙是受两套截然不同的物理规则制约的：一套规则对极小的粒子产生作用，如质子和电子；另一套则对其他所有事物产生作用。也许是觉得经济学理论太枯燥，需要加点儿新鲜手法，于是凯恩斯提出了一个类似量子力学的经济学研究视角，创造了两套经济规律，一套作用于微观层面（与个人及家庭生活相关），另一套作用于宏观层面（与国家和政府相关）。\n凯恩斯的理论提出时，适逢全球历史上最大规模的经济繁荣期即将结束。从经济角度来讲，19世纪与20世纪早期西方世界的产能增长水平与生活水平都是空前的，而此次经济繁荣的中心就是实行自由资本主义的美国。美国的独特之处就在于，它维护个体权利、限制政府权力。\n自由市场资本主义的本质就是权力分散，因此这一体制在全球大部分地区都对原有的僵化权力结构构成了威胁。此外，资本主义的扩张导致明显的贫富两极分化，促使一些社会学家和进步人士开始寻求他们眼中的公平正义，以取代自由市场资本主义体制。在这样的背景下，凯恩斯在看似不公平的市场经济中引入现代科学的概念。这种做法无意中迎合了国家权力中心和社会理想主义者的心态，使他们相信经济活动的确需要凯恩斯式的规划思路。\n凯恩斯的核心观点是，在经济不景气时，政府可以通过扩大货币供给和财政赤字缓和自由市场的波动。\n20世纪二三十年代，凯恩斯的追随者（即凯恩斯主义者）们崭露头角，与支持路德维希·冯·米塞斯（Ludwig von Mises）等经济学家观点的奥地利经济学派产生了冲突。奥地利学派认为，经济衰退是经济繁荣期所做出的错误决定的必要补偿，经济迅猛发展过后必然会有一个相应的衰退期。他们认为，政府利用低利率“刺激”经济的做法向各个企业发出了错误的信号，这才是经济繁荣的首要原因。\n因此，凯恩斯主义者力图缓解经济萧条，而奥地利学派则寻求避免虚假繁荣的途径。在两者随后的经济理论论战中，凯恩斯主义者有一个关键优势。\n凯恩斯主义使人们以为可以拿出解决经济危机的无痛方案，因此立刻受到政治家们的追捧。凯恩斯倡导的各项政策承诺提高就业率，在税收不增加、政府服务不减少的前提下推动经济发展，这些政策与那些无须节食、无须运动的神奇减肥计划一样具有魔力。尽管这些愿望不合常理，但却令人颇感慰藉，因此成了竞选活动中惯用的手法。\n凯恩斯主义允许政府摆出一副有能力提高人们生活水平的模样，只要印钞机开动起来，什么都可以做到。因为具有亲政府的倾向，凯恩斯主义者们比奥地利学派学者更有可能接受政府的任命。那些培养出数位金融大臣和财政部部长的大学的声望明显高于没有这些成就的大学，各大学经济系也不可避免地青睐那些支持凯恩斯主义的教授，而奥地利学派则不断受到排挤。\n同样，那些大型金融机构和众多经济学家效力的大雇主也都对凯恩斯的主张青睐有加。大银行和投资公司利用凯恩斯主义者创造的低息贷款和宽松货币政策等经济条件，赚得盆满钵满。另外，凯恩斯主义者认为政府政策应当鼓励投资，这一理念也帮助金融公司把手伸进了很多头脑发热的投资者的钱袋。因此，这些金融公司更倾向于雇用那些支持凯恩斯主义的经济学家。\n与呆板守旧的竞争对手相比，凯恩斯主义者有着明显的优势。于是，一个自我实现、相互吹捧的社会很快催生了一大批热衷于凯恩斯主义原则的顶级经济学家。\n这些经济学家将凯恩斯政策奉为真理，认为它可以结束大萧条的局面。他们中的很多人认为，如果没有政府出台的刺激政策（包括第二次世界大战必需的军费），我们永远也无法从经济衰退的绝境中恢复元气。事实上，此次大萧条是现代历史上历时最长、程度最严重的一次经济衰退，凯恩斯政策在这次经济衰退中首次得到了全面而充分的运用。至于这些政府干预措施究竟是不是经济萧条得到遏制的原因，这个问题至今为止仍然充满争议，但是所有正统的“经济学家”都认为这种争论没有什么价值。\n如果我们允许凯恩斯主义者们牢牢控制着多个经济部门、金融部门以及投资银行，那跟我们委托占星师而不是天文学家测量天体的运行速度是一样的。（是的，卫星曾经撞击过小行星，但那只是一次不期然的偶遇，是一次美丽的意外！）\n这种情形让人哭笑不得的地方在于，无论经济学家们多少次彻底搞砸了自己的任务，无论有多少支火箭还没有离开发射台就爆炸了，这些责任重大的人物没有一个质疑过自己处理问题的方式。\n普通人慢慢明白了，其实这些经济学家们根本不知道自己在说什么。但是大多数人只是想当然地认为这是因为经济领域的确太大了，并且充满风险，毫无逻辑可循，即便是受教育程度最高的人也不可能拥有预知一切的能力。\n但是，如果我告诉你凯恩斯主义者们所推崇的经济二元性根本就不存在，会怎样？如果经济学比他们所说的简单得多，会怎样？如果对母鹅有益的东西对公鹅也一样，会怎样？如果一个家庭乃至一个国家不可能靠花钱实现繁荣，又会怎样？\n很多人熟知我曾对2008年的经济衰退做过精准的预言，他们认为我的智慧决定了我的远见。我可以向你保证，大多数经济学家连自己身边的资产泡沫都看不到，而我并不比他们聪明。我具备的是对经济学基本原则全面而深刻的理解。\n我的确具有这个优势。在我还是个孩子的时候，父亲就为我准备了一个简单的工具包，里面的工具可以帮助我认清经济的真实面目。这些工具以故事、寓言以及思想实验的形式出现，本书就是以其中一个故事为基础展开的。\n我的父亲欧文·希夫（Irwin Schiff）拥有一定的知名度，与反对联邦所得税的全美运动有着千丝万缕的联系。他坚持认为所得税的强制实施违犯了美国宪法中与税收相关的三项条款、宪法第16修正案以及税收法律的有关规定，并在35年多的时间里持续不断地反对美国国税局的这一做法。他曾经就这个主题写过很多书，也曾在法庭上公开挑战联邦政府。因为这些举动，他付出了沉重的代价，直到86岁高龄时，他还被关押在联邦监狱中。\n但是在将自己的关注点转向税收之前，欧文·希夫已经是一位颇有名气的经济学家了。\n欧文·希夫于1928年出生于康涅狄格州纽黑文市一个下层中产阶级家庭，是家中的第八个孩子。他的父亲是一名工会会员，整个大家庭都是“罗斯福新政”的狂热支持者。1946年，欧文进入康涅狄格州州立大学学习经济学。以他的家庭背景和性格，没有人相信他会摒弃占统治地位的正统经济学观念，转而坚决支持过时的奥地利学派的观点——但是他却实实在在这样做了。\n欧文总是有独到的想法，加上对自己充满信心，他总感觉自己所学的东西与现实生活有些脱节。他深入研究了所有经济理论，广泛涉猎了亨利·赫兹利特（Henry Hazlitt）与亨利·格雷迪·韦弗（Henry Grady Weaver）等自由思想家的著作。尽管欧文的转变是循序渐进的（经历了1950\\~1960年整整10年的时间），但他最终成为健全货币、有限政府、低税收和个人责任的狂热信仰者。1964年，欧文满腔热情地支持巴里·戈德华特（Barry Goldwater）竞选美国总统。\n在1944年的布雷顿森林会议上，美国说服了全球很多国家支持美元取代黄金的做法。由于美国保证35美元兑换1盎司黄金，这个计划得到了广泛赞同，美国也因此拥有了世界上80%的黄金。\n然而，美联储中的凯恩斯主义者造成的长达40年的通货膨胀导致与美元直接挂钩的黄金价格严重下跌。这种错位的现象造成了众所周知的“黄金外流”。1965年，由法国牵头，许多国家纷纷以美国联邦储备券（即美元）兑换黄金，以1932年的金价从美国手里买走了大量黄金，美国的黄金储备迅速减少。\n1968年，林登·约翰逊总统的几位经济顾问声称，那次黄金外流并非由低价出售的诱惑力所致，而是因为外国政府担心美国的黄金储备不足，无法支持本国所持有的流通货币，也无法与外币进行兑换。为解决这个令人焦虑的问题，约翰逊总统的众多金融专家纷纷献计，建议将法定用于支持本国美元的25%的黄金储备转为外国美元持有者的备用储备。他们认为，这项额外的保护措施将会安抚外国政府，阻止黄金的继续外流。当时的欧文只是康涅狄格州纽黑文市的一个年轻的生意人，他对政府这种做法十分不解，觉得他们的观点非常荒唐。\n欧文给得克萨斯州的参议员约翰·托尔（John Tower）写了一封信，托尔当时是黄金问题评估委员会的成员。欧文在信中说，美国政府面临两种选择：要么强行摧毁现行的价格结构，将金价恢复到1932年的水平；要么调高金价，与1968年持平。换句话说，要调整凯恩斯主义导致的长达40年的通货膨胀，美国政府必须做出选择，要么紧缩通货，要么让美元贬值。\n尽管欧文认为通货紧缩或许是重振美国经济最有效的做法，因为通货紧缩可以使美元恢复购买力，但他觉得经济学家们错误地将价格下滑当作灾难，而政府天生具有通货膨胀的偏好（本书将对此进行论述）。出于这些考虑，他认为当权者至少要承认此前的经济下滑，并且降低美元对黄金的价值。在这样一个方案中，欧文觉得黄金的价格必须达到每盎司105美元。\n欧文还担心另外一种可能性更大也更危险的选择：政府不作为（其实这也正是政府的选择）。当时的选择是，究竟是面对现实解决问题，还是将问题留给下一代人。当权者选择了将问题留给下一代人，而我们就是那下一代人。\n托尔对欧文论证问题的基本逻辑印象深刻，他邀请欧文为黄金问题评估委员会全体委员做报告。在这次听证会上，来自美联储、美国财政部以及国会的高级货币专家们都证实，与黄金脱钩将会增强美元的购买力，降低金价，引领美国进入一个繁荣发展的阶段。\n在其证词中，欧文却坚持认为，美元与黄金脱钩会导致金价飞涨。更重要的是，他还警告说，一种没有任何内在价值的货币会导致大规模通货膨胀以及无法持续的政府负债。但在当时，这种少数派的意见完全被忽视了，美国政府取消了金本位制。\n与经济学家们的预期相反，额外的储备未能阻止黄金的外流。最终，美国总统理查德·尼克松于1971年彻底切断了美元与黄金的联系。从此以后，全球经济体系完全建立在没有任何价值的美元之上。接下来的10年里，美国经历了史上最严重的通货膨胀，黄金价格直逼每盎司800美元的天价。\n1972年，欧文在其著作中展开了对凯恩斯主义经济学的首次全力攻击。在书中，他指出凯恩斯经济学将美国引向了一条不可持续的经济发展之路。这部名为“最大的骗局：政府是怎样欺骗你的”（The Biggest Con: How the Government Is Fleecing You）的著作赢得了广泛的赞誉，销量也相当可观。书中有很多有趣的故事，其中有一个故事讲的是三个人在一座小岛上徒手捕鱼的事。\n这个故事是欧文在一次全家自驾游时为了消磨时间讲的。当时堵车，欧文就想给两个年少的儿子讲点儿经济学的基本知识（任何男孩都会对此感兴趣）。为了让两个儿子开心，他总会讲些有意思的故事。这次讲的就是“鱼的故事”。\n这个故事构成了《最大的骗局》一书中其中一章的主要内容。大约8年之后，由于众多读者反映非常喜欢他写的故事，欧文决定将这本书改版为有插图的书，并命名为“经济增长模式与停滞的原因”（How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn’t）。这本书于1979年首次发行，受到了奥地利学派追随者的狂热追捧。\n30年后，我看着美国经济垂死挣扎，看着美国政府不断重复和加深过去的错误，此时，我的弟弟和我觉得要为新一代修改和更新“鱼的故事”，现在正是最佳时机。\n当然，现在人们最需要的是了解经济的真实情况，而这个故事是我们所知道的最佳工具，它可以帮助人们更好地了解是什么在推动经济的运行。\n我们这个版本的故事在很多方面比我们的父亲欧文30年前的那个版本更富有雄心。我们的视野更宽，为使故事与历史脉络衔接自然，我们付出了更大的努力。事实上，我们的故事应该说是在父亲那个故事基础上的即兴发挥。\n听到经济学家们喋喋不休地谈论与现实生活看似毫无关联的概念时，有些人会不知所云。我们希望这本书能够吸引这些读者。我们打算证明凯恩斯主张的经济模式（政府相信没有价值的货币可以作为有效的经济润滑剂并不加证实地采纳了这个模式）是错误的，而且是危险的。\n可惜，所有的经济学家都忘记了他们正戴着玫瑰色眼镜。当你摘下他们的眼镜时，就会清晰地看到我们的国家正面临着很多严重的问题，而我们非但没有使形势好转，反而使它变得更加糟糕。幸运的是，如果我们重新理清思路，我们至少还有机会努力解决这些问题。\n本书的主题非常严肃，但在这个压力巨大的时代，我们选择了一种幽默的方法阐释这个主题——这也是我们的父亲欧文的愿望。\n\\[1\\]1公里=1千米。写在前面\n在这个关于美国经济史的寓言故事中，读者会遇到很多似曾相识的人物与事件。但是，要将这样一个错综复杂的故事浓缩为一部漫画式作品，只能进行粗线条的描述。\n除了特定历史人物的辉煌成就之外，故事中的人物代表着更宽泛的概念。例如，本·伯南柯的原型很明显是美联储主席本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke），但故事中伯南柯的所作所为却不是单纯指伯南克本人的做法，他其实是所有主张高通货膨胀率的经济学家的代表。\n在现实生活中，美国联邦储备券在富兰克林·罗斯福当选总统前20年就已经出现了。但考虑到他有花钱的嗜好，于是我们决定将这一创新归功于他；当美国参议院银行委员会前主席克里斯·多德（Chris Dodd）还是个孩子的时候，房利美（联邦国民抵押贷款协会）就已经存在了，但是因为他多年来对该公司的扶持，在我们的故事里，我们赋予他公司创始人的身份。还有，尽管本书提到的那些外国岛屿基本上都与真实的国家相关，但这些岛屿也是所有国家的化身。我们对某些历史事件及人物经历进行了艺术处理，请您多多包涵。第一章\n一个好点子出炉了\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n从前，有三个人——艾伯、贝克和查理，他们住在一座岛上。这座小岛地处热带，却不是天堂。这里的人们生活艰苦，没有任何奢侈品，而且食物的种类极少，他们的菜单上只有一道菜：鱼。\n幸运的是，小岛周围有数量可观的鱼，但奇怪的是，这些鱼全部属于同一品种，每条鱼都很大，足够一个人吃一天。然而，这个地方很闭塞，人类先进的捕鱼技术这里一种都没有。他们能做的只有跳进水里，用手去抓住那些又黏又滑的家伙。\n运用这种低效的技术，每人每天只能捕到一条鱼，只能帮他们挨到第二天。捕鱼成了小岛经济的全部。他们每天的活动就是醒来、捕鱼、吃鱼、睡觉。虽然生活不算惬意，但总好过忍饥挨饿。\n因此，在这座生活超级简单、只有生鱼片可吃的小岛上——\n没有存款！\n没有借贷！\n没有投资！\n所有的产出全都消费掉了！没有未雨绸缪，没有多余的财物可以借出。\n虽然这座小岛上的居民过着一种原始的生活，但这并不能说明他们愚笨迟钝或者没有追求。与所有人一样，艾伯、贝克和查理也想提高自己的生活水平，但是要实现这个梦想，他们每人每天捕鱼的数量就必须超过一条。不幸的是，由于他们只能徒手捕鱼，而那些鱼又很机敏狡猾，三个人只能勉强糊口。\n一天夜里，仰望着繁星点点的夜空，艾伯开始思索自己生活的意义……“难道我的日子就这样了吗？肯定有比现在更舒心的日子。”\n除了捕鱼，艾伯还想做点儿别的事情。他想做几件更好、更时尚的棕榈叶衣服，他想要一个遮风挡雨的住所，当然他还想执导几部故事片。但他每天忙于捕鱼糊口，这些梦想如何成真呢？\n他的大脑飞快运转着……突然他想到了捕鱼器，这个物件可以在很大程度上扩大人手可触及的范围，并且使鱼溜掉的概率大大缩小，只要一下捉住它，它就很难逃脱。有了这个新装置，他就能在较短的时间里捕到更多的鱼了！而那些空闲时间，他就可以用来做更好的衣服、建个住所，最后再拍部影片。\n艾伯在头脑中勾勒着捕鱼器的轮廓，想着想着就激情澎湃。他构想出一个不再受捕鱼之累的未来。\n他决定给自己的捕鱼器取个名字，叫作“渔网”，然后开始找材料织这张网。\n第二天，贝克和查理注意到艾伯没有捕鱼，而是站在沙滩上用棕榈树皮搓绳子。“你在干什么呢？”贝克问，“难道在减肥吗？你要是老坐在那儿弄那些绳子，会挨饿的啊。”\n艾伯解释说：“我突然有个灵感，想做个捕鱼器，这样就可以尝试捕鱼的新方法了。有了这个捕鱼器，捕鱼的时间就能缩短，再也不会挨饿了。”\n查理惊得眼珠直转，他想自己的朋友肯定是疯了。“你疯了，这样做，我告诉你……疯了。要是你这捕鱼器不好使，可别哭着来跟我要鱼吃，一片也别想。我头脑清醒，但这并不表示我会为你的疯狂做法埋单。”\n艾伯没有被查理的话吓倒，仍然继续织网。\n到这一天结束时，艾伯终于织完了自己的渔网。通过自我牺牲（挨饿），他创造了资本。\n故事引申\n在这个简单的任务中，艾伯向我们展示了一个基本的经济原则，这个原则可以提高人们的生活水平：消费不足，敢于冒险！\n消费不足：为了织网，艾伯那天就不能去捕鱼。他必须放弃当天的所得，放弃那条本来可以捕到、吃到的鱼。他这样做并不是因为他不需要鱼，事实上，他爱吃鱼，而且如果那天没有捕到鱼，他就会饿肚子。他对鱼的需求与他的两个朋友没有什么不同。他选择暂时延迟消费（吃鱼），是为了将来消费更多的产品（捕到更多的鱼）。\n冒险：除了消费不足，艾伯还需要冒险，因为他也不知道自己做的捕鱼器到底好不好用。自己花费了一天的时间饿着肚子辛苦劳动，却不知道这东西究竟能不能补偿所失。最后的结果很可能只剩一把绳子和一个饿瘪的胃。如果这个想法失败了，艾伯不能指望贝克和查理给自己任何补偿，因为他俩早就警告过他这样做很傻。\n在经济学术语中，资本指的是一种设备，这种设备的建设和使用本身没有什么意义，其意义在于利用设备建设和制造其他需要的东西。艾伯想要的不是那张网，而是鱼。这张网或许可以给他带来更多的鱼。因此，这张网就是一种资本，是有价值的。\n那天晚上，当贝克和查理吃饱睡大觉时，艾伯却只能在脑海中想象着美味的鱼肉来对抗难忍的饥饿。然而，饥饿带来的痛苦并不能浇灭他对未来的希望。他希望自己的选择是正确的，希望自己有一个光明的未来，希望那时有吃不完的鱼。\n第二天，贝克和查理对艾伯的发明好一顿嘲笑。\n贝克说：“嘿，这顶帽子看上去不赖啊。”\n查理说：“就是戴着打网球有点儿热，你说呢？”\n“你们就笑吧！”艾伯回应道，“等着瞧吧，等我的鱼多得没处放时，看看那时笑的是谁。”\n艾伯拿着渔网朝海浪冲去。他对如何使用这个奇怪的渔网还不得要领，因此不断遭到两个朋友的嘲笑。\n但是几分钟后，他找到了窍门，很快就捕到一条鱼。\n贝克和查理不再笑了。在接下来的一小时里，艾伯又捕到了第二条鱼。两个伙伴惊叹不已，毕竟，他们通常一整天才能抓住一条鱼！\n从这样一个简单的行动开始，这座小岛上的经济开始发生巨大的变化。艾伯提高了生产力，这对每个人而言都是好事。\n艾伯现在还在考虑他突然间得到的恩惠：“既然我一天捕到的鱼可以吃两天，那么我可以利用隔天休息的时间做点儿别的事情。可做的事情太多啦！”\n故事引申\n艾伯的生产力提高了一倍，现在他生产的东西多于自己需要消费的东西。生产力的提高带来了许多益处。\n在艾伯孤注一掷去编织渔网之前，小岛上还没有什么储蓄之所。他决定冒险挨饿制造的这张网成了小岛上的第一件资本设备。这件设备接着会带来储蓄（为了让这个故事能够继续进行，我们假设这些鱼不会腐烂变质），而这种剩余产品就是健康经济的命脉。\n现实链接\n对所有物种而言（人类除外），经济学其实可以简单理解为日常生存活动。食物短缺、天气恶劣、食肉动物的威胁、疾病的困扰、发明相对较少、忍饥挨饿地活着（有一点儿剩余时间进行再生产），这是所有动物的生存常态。所幸我们人类拥有两样东西——我们的大脑和灵巧的双手，否则我们的命运跟那些动物不会有什么分别（在不太久远的过去，我们跟它们是一样的）。靠着大脑和灵巧的双手，我们制造了工具和机器，改造环境的能力大大提高。\n经济学家托马斯·伍兹（Thomas Woods）喜欢用一个简单的思想实验测试学生：如果所有的机器和工具都不复存在，我们的经济会是什么样子？汽车、拖拉机、炼钢炉、铲子、独轮（手推）车、锯、斧头、长矛等，如果这些东西真的全都消失了，我们所有的消费品都要靠自己的双手猎取、采摘、种植和制作，那会是什么样子？\n毫无疑问，那样的生活肯定很艰苦。如果我们必须赤手空拳地制服猎物、将其作为食物的话，想象一下那该有多艰难吧。以我们的能力根本不可能逮住大家伙，兔子或许还有可能——但你总得先抓住它们啊。如果我们必须用手种菜、摘菜，如果我们连装粮食的麻袋都没有的话，又会怎样？设想一下，如果没有工厂，我们必须自己缝衣服、做家具，而且连最起码的剪刀和钉子都没有，那又会怎样？\n尽管我们有智慧，但我们过得可能并不比黑猩猩和猿猴好多少，至少从经济方面来看是这样。\n工具改变了一切，使经济的出现成为可能。长矛帮助我们捕获猎物，铲子帮助我们种植庄稼，渔网帮助我们捕鱼。这些工具提高了我们的劳动效率。我们生产的东西越多，可以消费的东西就越多，我们的生活也就变得越美好。\n努力使有限的资源（每种资源都是有限的）产生最大的效益以尽可能满足人类的需求，这就是经济这一概念最简单的定义。工具、资本以及创新是实现这一目标的关键。\n牢记这一点，我们就很容易理解经济增长的原因：找到了生产人类所需物品的更好方式。不管一个经济体最后变得多么强大，这个原因是不会改变的。第二章\n把财富分享给别人\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n艾伯，那个企业家，看起来前途一片光明。但是，小岛上另外两个人的情况又如何呢？我们是不是创造了一个贫富分化的等级体系？贝克和查理会因为艾伯的成功而不安吗？不大可能。虽然艾伯从来没有刻意使他人受益，但他的资本无疑帮助了岛上的所有人。我们来看看这是怎么回事。\n亲眼见证了艾伯轻松捕鱼的全过程，贝克和查理央求他分享新发明的捕鱼器。\n“嘿，艾伯！”查理说，“既然那玩意儿你隔天才用一次，那你不用的那天，让我用用行吧？”\n贝克说：“喂，老兄，有福同享啊。”\n但是艾伯还对昨天的事情耿耿于怀。他还记得自己的牺牲……他还记得他们俩的嘲讽，而且他还想到了风险。“如果他们把我的渔网弄破了怎么办？如果他们不还我怎么办？那我就要从头再来了。再见，穿树叶的哥们儿！”\n想到这些，艾伯拒绝了两人的要求。“对不起，哥们儿。我自己做了渔网，你们俩肯定也能自己做，至少你们现在知道那东西是有用的，对吧！”\n尽管查理已经看到用渔网捕鱼的效率，但他很担心自己能不能编织出这样一张网。\n他对艾伯说：“我怎么知道自己能不能编织出来？我以前从来没做过这样的东西，而且我也挨不了饿。我怕自己织好网前就饿死了！”\n贝克提出了另外一个建议：“好吧，你这个吝啬鬼，看来你是不会帮我们什么忙了。我们知道了。你看这样行不行，我们编织渔网时，你把富余的鱼借给我们吃，那样我们织网时就不用挨饿了。等我们捕到多余的鱼，再把鱼如数还给你。”\n尽管艾伯觉得这个办法比白白把网借给他们要好，但他还是不放心。“如果我把鱼借给你们，怎么保证你们不会躺在沙滩上一整天都不干活呢？即使你们织出自己的网来，也许还不好用呢。如果那样，你们就永远无法还我鱼了，而我失去了自己的储蓄，一无所有了！你们总得想一个更好的办法。”\n查理和贝克这才明白，他们让艾伯冒险把鱼借给自己，却没有考虑到他的个人利益。但是捕到更多鱼的诱惑太大了，所以两人很快就想到了一个办法，让艾伯忍不住冒险一试。\n他们认为必须在数字上做文章，于是金融思维诞生了！\n贝克走近艾伯，说道：“我们做个约定吧：你借给我们一条鱼，我们会还你两条。这可是百分之百的利润啊。除了这座小岛，你到哪儿能找到这样的高回报？”\n艾伯动心了。“我对这个约定很感兴趣！”他的语气中没有任何迟疑。\n艾伯想到了那些财富：“如果我借给他们两条鱼，就能收回4条。也就是说，我什么都不用做就可以得到两条鱼。那我岂不成了一个鱼老板啦！”\n也许有些人觉得艾伯有些过分了。如果这个故事是一部好莱坞电影，他这时肯定会得意地捻着自己打了蜡的胡子。他这是在窃取别人的劳动成果，靠别人的辛苦劳动获利！\n但是这样评论艾伯是不恰当的，因为即便艾伯的动机只是想赚些鱼，他的贪婪也可能带来一些意想不到的益处。\n有一点很重要，我们要知道艾伯并不是一定要把鱼借给别人，他还有其他方案，包括以下4个选择：\n1\\.他可以把鱼留下，留着自己以后吃——这是最保险的选择。这样，他不会有任何损失，当然，他的储蓄也不会有什么增长。\n2\\.他可以放纵一下，不再干活，将自己的储蓄（存下的鱼）消费掉。\n3\\.他可以建立自己的渔网出租公司。如果艾伯每天吃掉一条富余的鱼，两天就可以再编织出两张网。\n然后，他可以把多余的网租给贝克和查理，向他们收取每人每天半条鱼的租金。这样，艾伯每天不必亲自捕鱼就可以得到生存所需的那条鱼了。哈哈，提前退休！\n在这个方案中，贝克和查理每天也许能用租来的渔网捕到两条鱼。在向艾伯支付半条鱼的租金之后，他们每人每天还剩下一条半鱼，比他们没有渔网时捕到的鱼多50%，算是双赢的买卖了。\n尽管这个方案很吸引人，艾伯还是注意到了其中的逻辑缺陷。贝克和查理租借渔网的时间可能只有两天，然后用富余的鱼果腹，花一天时间织出自己的网。如此一来，他能得到的鱼就只有两条——那可真够冒险的！\n4\\.他可以把两条鱼借给贝克和查理，收取100%的利息。在这个方案中，如果两个人按照约定利率足额偿还，艾伯就可以得到4条鱼。但是，这个方案也存在风险，他们可能会翻脸不认账。\n抉择……抉择……艰难的抉择！\n总的来说，艾伯（以及这个社会）处理储蓄（鱼）的方式只有5种：\n1\\.他可以把储蓄存起来。\n2\\.他可以把储蓄消费掉。\n3\\.他可以把储蓄借出去。\n4\\.他可以用储蓄投资。\n5\\.他可以将上述4个方式有机结合起来。\n毫无疑问，艾伯的最终决定取决于个人对风险和回报的偏好。但不管最终方案是什么，他的抉择都会惠及这座小岛的经济，而且也不会给自己的两个邻居增加负担。\n最后，艾伯选择把鱼借出去。\n故事引申\n艾伯愿意并有能力把多余的鱼借给别人，因此，贝克和查理也拥有了自己的渔网。现在大家都有渔网可用了，小岛上的整体捕鱼能力便从每天三条鱼提高到每天6条鱼，经济增长翻番，前景更加光明。\n但事实并非如此，因为这三个人对自己颇具局限性的生活方式感到不满。饥饿（其经济术语为“需求”）只是刺激经济增长的必要而非充分条件。\n追求更多是人类的本性。不管已经拥有什么，我们总是想要更多。也许不是想要更多的东西，而是更多的时间、更多的乐趣、更多的选择，所有这些需求都需要资本。艾伯、贝克和查理这些年来对鱼的问题可能都没少抱怨，但他们最后都成功地提高了生产力，满足了自己的需求。\n有了多余的鱼，小岛上的几位居民每天终于可以比原来多吃一些鱼了（原来是每天一条鱼），但是经济并没有增长，因为他们的消费增长了。而他们的消费之所以增长，是因为经济增长了。这个道理很简单，但令人不解的是现代经济学家竟然会在这个简单的问题上纠缠不休。\n大多数经济学家认为，给老百姓更多的钱花就可以增加需求，但是这种做法并不能改变真正的需求，只会使人们花更多的钱购买已经生产出来的商品。只有增加供给才能切实满足人们更多的需求。\n当然，有人也许并没有清楚地看到其中的共同利益。看到艾伯猛增的财富，如果贝克和查理心生嫉妒，强烈要求分得他的部分储蓄该怎么办？\n设想一下这个场景：\n贝克烦躁地说：“看看那家伙穿着棕榈叶做成的小礼服那副得意的样子。我们每天一身臭汗风里来浪里去地跟那些滑头的鱼斗争，他却没有一点儿善心！他就不能分给我一两条鱼，哪怕让我休息一天也好啊！他的鱼多得堆成山，少一条也没什么啊！”\n查理附和道：“分给我点儿吧，贵人！”\n或者再想一下下面这个场景：\n假设艾伯对自己的相对财富有些负罪感，听了两个人的说法后思想动摇了，于是无偿地把鱼分给了他们，那么贝克和查理会怎样处理这些鱼呢？\n没有了还款的压力，两个人最有可能做的是利用这份礼物享受闲暇时光。这样做并没有什么错（事实上，这也是大多数人类行为的目标），但是贝克和查理的假日时光并不能提高这座小岛的生产能力。因此，尽管慈善之举听起来颇有雅量，也会提升艾伯的人气，但这一举动却无法像商业贷款一样推动经济发展。\n最根本的是，所有能够增加捕鱼（生产）量的事物都会惠及小岛，鱼越多，大家就越有可能吃到更多东西，也就越有可能做捕鱼以外的事情，或者他们可以什么都不做。\n故事引申\n也许有人会想，如果艾伯果真是一个贪心的人，拿着自己的新财富生财，从而变得越来越富有，那该怎么办？\n这样真的很危险吗？如果艾伯增加储蓄（而不需要亲自劳动）的唯一途径就是将这些储蓄借给自己的邻居的话，那他又何必大量囤积呢？\n但若非如此，他的财产就不会增加，甚至还会越来越少，因为他自己还要消费呢！私人资本主义可以促使那些将个人利益作为唯一动机的人帮助他人提高生活水平，这是最有意义的。\n现实链接\n财富从来就是一个相对的概念。在原始社会，财富是极少的，那时最富有的人所拥有的物质财富还不如工业化社会中穷人的财富多。在中世纪，即便是至高无上的国王也缺乏基础的娱乐设施，而在今天的美国，中央空调、室内管网以及冬天里新鲜的蔬菜等几乎是人人都能享受的。尽管贝克和查理认为每天吃两条鱼简直奢侈到了极点，可在我们看来，这种生活丝毫不值得羡慕。\n但是令人吃惊的是，财富是分等级的，这个事实本身就不公平。人们认为富人之所以富有，是因为他们攫取别人的财富，并由此产生了穷人。在现代经济学中有一个理论认为，利润是通过少付工人工资产生的，有人称之为“劳动价值论”。这样看来，像艾伯这样的企业家或类似的大型公司要想致富，只能先让别人变穷。\n上述理念与道德取舍息息相关，但与现实无甚关联。富人致富的原因（至少开始时）是他们为他人提供了有价值的东西。艾伯就为那些没有足够储蓄的人提供了储蓄。如果他赢利了，那也是因为他提供的服务对别人是有价值的。\n如果艾伯是一个无赖，每天所做的就是窃取邻居一半的劳动成果，那么他的财富就是建立在那些受其压迫的人的贫穷的基础之上的。这种做法会迫使他人做一些损害自己利益的事情，不会增强这座小岛的整体生产能力。艾伯可能会直接拿走别人生产的东西，而岛上的产量并没有任何变化，不仅如此，他们的整体产能还可能下降。当被压迫阶级认识到自己的劳动果实被人偷走时，就会缩减自己的劳动量。\n历史上，此类事例并不少见，奴隶制、农奴制以及佃农制都属于这一类型。当自身的利益受到损害时，劳动者就会奋起反抗压迫，如果他们的劳动惠及自身的话，这种反抗会更加强烈。\n不幸的是，争取充分经济自由的实例在世界历史上还很鲜见。不过，一旦利己主义得到发展机会，生产能力就会迅速提高。\n信用卡的使用就是经济自由惠及百姓的最佳例证。只要贷款人和借款人可以自由地达成协议，总体效果就是好的。然而，我们将来会发现，借贷市场会受到外力挤压，如果出现这种情况，灾难便在所难免了。第三章\n信用卡的多种用途\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n如前所述，艾伯决定把鱼借给贝克和查理，这样他们两个人就可以编织渔网了。这种商业贷款是资本的最佳用途，因为这样可以扩大生产。\n当然，通过借钱或借鱼的做法创业，无法保证企业一定会成功，因为借款人可能无法完全实现自己最初的计划。\n也就是说，查理和贝克如果不能成功地编织出自己的渔网，艾伯借出的鱼就打了水漂。\n在很多案例中，企业失败的原因在于没有意识到事先应当做好所有约定。假设贝克和查理不是向艾伯借鱼、省出时间来织网，而是利用这些时间研发对鱼群实施催眠术的技术，情况可能会大不相同。\n如果他们研发的技术无效，这项贷款就无法使“借款人”查理和贝克受益，而贷款人艾伯也得不到任何好处。\n最糟糕的情况是，贷给不赢利企业的那些款项浪费了社会储蓄，降低了生产力。结果，贷款人连本金都很难收回，更不要说利息了。\n但是实施顺利的商业计划弥补了那些实施不利的计划的损失。\n因此，很重要的一点是，你要知道商业贷款并非社会储蓄的唯一选择，艾伯还可以选择其他贷款形式——消费贷款和应急贷款。\n故事引申\n一旦外部力量（比如政府干预）以各种理由鼓励或者要求储蓄者借出款项，而不考虑实际还款的可能性，这时贷款人就难免要承受较大的损失。这种有悖常规的做法只会浪费社会储蓄。\n各国政府满腔热情要做点儿好事，总想干预储蓄的借贷方式。它们通过诸多法律，使得某些贷款类型比其他类型更有吸引力。但是，政府并没有储蓄，只有个人才有！假如在政府的激励之下，贷款都流向了那些最终无法还款的个人或者企业（它们的确经常无力还款），那么这些损失就要由那些牺牲了自己的利益创造储蓄的个人来承担了！\n事实上，如果艾伯是被迫向外贷款，而他又认为这份贷款颇有风险，比如用于鱼类催眠术之类的情况，那么他一开始就会很不情愿这样做。因此，他可能会决定不再那么努力地工作，或者不再牺牲那么多去储蓄了！\n消费贷款\n假设艾伯不是把鱼借给贝克和查理，让他们去织自己的网，而是满足两人的借款需求，他们因此可以去度假，情况就会有所不同。\n贝克会说：“嘿，捕鱼大王，你别在那儿数鱼了，还是借几条鱼给我和我的兄弟查理，我们一两天就还你。不是只有你一个人有权享受悠闲的生活，再说，我们又不是不还你。”\n“天地良心，我知道捕鱼是件多么辛苦的事。”艾伯答道，“但是别忘了，如果我借给你们一条鱼，你们还是要还我两条，补偿我承担的风险。”\n“小事一桩，鱼王！”查理接茬儿道，“假期过后我们就休息好了，就能比以前捕更多的鱼，我们会连本带利还你的。”\n但是，如果贝克和查理不提高自己的生产能力，他们又怎么能连本带利地归还贷款呢？在休息几天之后，他们还是每天只能捕到一条鱼。为了还艾伯的鱼，他们以后每天就要减少自己的食量。为了偿还贷款，他们将不得不降低自己的生活水平！\n艾伯知道很可能会出现这个结果，于是试着跟他们商量：“我说伙计们，你们为什么要现在借鱼，将来又饿着肚子还鱼呢？其实你们可以现在做些牺牲，挨一天饿，给自己织张网。这样将来就有保障了，随便什么时候想歇着就歇着，那样多好。”\n“听着！”贝克和查理说道，“别说这些假仁假义的废话了，快把鱼给我们拿来！”\n艾伯应该拒绝贷款给他们，因为这笔交易不仅会让他的储蓄承担不必要的风险，而且会导致他的资本无法产生更多的生产性贷款。如果艾伯承受住他们的冷嘲热讽，就相当于规避了未来的风险，因为消费贷款如果不能提高产能的话，这笔贷款无论是对贷款人还是借款人来说都是一种负担。\n应急贷款\n事实证明，艾伯拒绝贷款给贝克和查理作为“假期”（消费）之用是极其明智的。一周之后，两人都生了一种奇怪的水痘，双双病倒，一个星期都没能去捕鱼。\n现在出现了紧急情况，艾伯可以从自己的储蓄（鱼）中拿出一部分作为困难生活贷款。贝克和查理可以先吃借来的鱼，等身体恢复了再出去捕鱼。尽管艾伯很清楚这次的“贷款”血本无归的可能性很大，但他知道，如果不贷款给他们，风险更高。与消费贷款不同，如果艾伯不向贝克和查理提供这份应急贷款，两人很可能会丧命。如果真的发生这种情况，这座小岛就失去生产能力了。\n如果艾伯之前已经将自己的储蓄作为没有收益的消费贷款借出的话，这次就无法拿出这份应急贷款了。\n事实上，在社会生死攸关之时，储蓄便显得至关重要。\n故事引申\n遇到经济可能收紧的情况时，政治家和银行家常会讨论是否需要“扩大信贷”，增加可以借出的贷款数额。但是是否可以随心所欲地这样做呢？在我们这些捕鱼的朋友的案例中，艾伯合法地借出的鱼不会多于自己所储存的鱼，这座小岛的贷款总额会受到岛上所储存的鱼总量的制约。\n现实链接\n不幸的是，为了开展许多政治家和社会理论家眼中的有益活动，政府总会通过各种形式干预储蓄的配置，包括政府贷款担保、公司及个人税收减免以及税务罚款等。\n有了这些干预手段，个人与企业也许更愿意申请某些类型的贷款，而银行也更愿意批准这些类型的贷款。于是，更多的社会资源便会投入这些受欢迎的活动中，比如住房建设、大学教育以及太阳能电池板的生产。\n这些政策的关键推动因素就是认为政府规划者要比储蓄者更清楚什么有利于社会发展的观念。但是，并没有证据表明事实就是这样。实际上，历史上充斥着各种浮夸的政策与方案，这些方案都是政府智囊团策划的，最终全都没有兑现它们的诺言。\n更重要的是，政府介入储蓄者和借款人之间采取的强制手段将借款的原因与结果割裂开来，使得储蓄的分配效率极为低下。\n影响个体贷款人的往往是贷款的财务结果，而不是基本活动的政治象征意义。而那些遵循成功模式并由业绩记录良好的所有者经营的企业，还贷率往往较高。因此，这种类型的企业规划更容易吸引贷款人。这与达尔文的观点相似，即自然选择催生了生命力更强的物种，这种借贷原则催生出更加健康的企业和更加强劲的经济。\n如果财务状况被视为次要因素，这种情况也就不存在了。贷给个人或者企业的款项如果无法成功促成必要的创新或者提高产能，就会浪费储蓄的供给，削弱整体经济。\n但我们在本书后面的内容中会发现，不断扩大货币供应量的做法以及政府看似无限的负债能力掩盖了一个事实——实际信贷是受有限储备制约的。\n现在，人们都认为信贷市场的有效运作所需要的就是有意愿的借款人。然而，与其他资源一样，在发放贷款前必须先积累储蓄才行。第四章\n经济到底是如何发展的\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n几周之后，艾伯、贝克和查理凭借新织的网迅速捕到了大量的鱼，他们开始每天捕两条鱼。因为每人每天只需吃一条鱼，岛上的储蓄很快开始膨胀。尽管他们偶尔决定挥霍一下，一天吃两条鱼，但是在大多数情况下他们对自己的劳动成果非常节省。\n小岛上的三位居民从天天捕鱼的日子中解脱出来，终于得闲去参加其他有创意、有意思的活动了。艾伯可以花些时间设计和制造更实用也更漂亮的棕榈叶服装；贝克采摘椰子，丰富了食谱，也提升了厨艺；查理则盖起了小岛上的第一座小茅屋。\n三个人的日子过得很顺心，但是贝克认为他们还可以过得更好。他说：“既然我们可以用渔网扩大生产，那为什么不能更进一步形成产业呢？”他开始想象制造一件更大更好的资本设备。\n他草拟出一种结构复杂的捕鱼器的生产计划，这个捕鱼器将彻底改变这座小岛的经济。这个发明是一个巨大的水下巨型捕鱼器，有一个单向的门，不管白天还是晚上都可以不间断地捕鱼。是的，鱼可以进来，但是出不去。如果这个巨型捕鱼器管用，他们就再也不用亲自捕鱼了。\n但是，贝克很快发现，单凭他自己的力量根本无法完成这样一项复杂的工程。考虑到必需的材料、编织网、搭架子、建造等一系列工程实施问题，贝克认为只靠他一个人的储蓄、体力和才智根本不可能完成这样一项巨大的工程。\n考虑到这些问题，贝克决定提议创立一家合伙公司，即三个人共创一家公司，克服暂时的困难，集中他们所有的储蓄，拿出整整一周的时间建造这个巨型捕鱼器。\n听了贝克的计划后，他们开始讨论其中的潜在风险。跟艾伯的第一张网一样，没有人能保证这个计划一定能成功。即便计划成功，那个新发明的玩意儿第一次入海时也很有可能被海浪冲得支离破碎。而且这一次他们的风险可不是损失一条鱼，而是20多条！\n然而，他们对更多鱼的需求最终战胜了对失去全部储蓄的担忧。\n三个人向着目标前进。\n经过一番艰苦卓绝的努力，他们成功地建成了小岛上第一个巨型捕鱼器。这个设备果然不负众望，平均每周能捕到20条鱼，而且毫不费力。除了几次小修小补和维护之外，这个捕鱼器几乎是在自动工作。很快，三人便拥有了大量的鱼。\n由于生产力的提高，岛上的储蓄迅速增加，于是三人很快又建了一个巨型捕鱼器。\n现在，有了这么多鱼，他们就能腾出时间实施其他计划了。\n查理制作了一块冲浪板，开创了一项很酷的新式休闲活动。\n艾伯创立了一家服装公司，不仅可以为自己制作衣服，还可以为所有想改变形象的小岛居民提供服饰。在业余时间里，艾伯还开始策划自己一个人的舞台剧。\n贝克则利用自己的空闲时间考虑小岛上恼人的交通问题，开始设计岛上的第一条独木舟和第一辆手推车。\n这些丰富的活动说明了人类社会在农业发展之后所发生的变化。只有当我们能够生产出额外的食物时，我们才有时间做其他事情。\n故事引申\n储蓄不只是提高个人消费能力的手段，还是防止经济受到意外因素影响的重要缓冲器。\n如果一场季风横扫小岛，把两个巨型捕鱼器摧毁了，他们该怎么办？尽管很多当代经济学家将自然灾害视为经济的刺激因素，但实际上洪灾、火灾、飓风和地震等灾害会破坏财富，降低生活水平。如果巨型捕鱼器被彻底毁掉了，小岛上的捕鱼量就会下降，那么艾伯、贝克和查理就又要忍饥挨饿地储蓄鱼以重建资产了。\n但是，请记住，一笔备用的储蓄会防止经济崩溃，可以迅速重建受损的资产。艾伯、贝克和查理三人继续缩减消费进行储蓄的做法非常重要，此乃未雨绸缪之举。\n现实链接\n过去，美国以储蓄大国而著称。在历史上，美国居民每年都会将收入的10%甚至更多储蓄起来。这种严格自律的做法帮助美国建立了巨大的储蓄供应，为不断推进的工业活动提供了金融支持，同时也帮助美国的家庭和社区克服意外的困难。\n然而，近年来经济学家们严重低估了储蓄在经济价值链中的重要性。事实上，在很多经济学家看来，储蓄就是一种累赘。凯恩斯主义者认为储蓄对发展不利，因为这种做法妨碍了货币循环、降低了消费（他们认为消费是促进经济增长的重要因素）。而政策制定者们受这些观点影响，制定出各种规则奖励花钱的人、惩罚存钱的人。\n结果，美国人多年来总是入不敷出。在自给自足的经济中，比如小岛经济，这样做根本不可能。但是在我们的现代社会中，货币流通跨越国界，而印钞机似乎具有无限魔力，可以欺瞒美国民众，让他们无法认清一个简单的事实：我们的消费不能超过产能，我们的借款不能超出存款，至少不能长期这样。\n当2008年金融危机爆发时，政治家和经济学家们条件反射式地寻求各种方法，让消费者花得更多、存得更少。\n他们的做法只能适得其反，为了消费而消费的做法没有任何意义。如果你花了100万美元，除了空气之外什么都没有买到，那会怎么样？对社会有什么好处？这笔交易只会使出售空气的人受益，他会把原本属于你的那100万美元拿走。用现代的经济核算方法计算，比如以GDP衡量，这笔交易会被当作一次真实的经济活动，会被算作价值100万美元的增长。\n但是购买空气的做法不会推动经济增长。空气一直都在那儿。我们必须生产出什么东西，才会使消费有价值。\n消费只是我们用来衡量生产的尺度，因为所有生产出来的东西最终都是用于消费的。那么消费有什么实际意义呢？只要价格降得足够低，即便是没人想要的东西也可以卖出去。但是，如果没有生产，也就没有东西可消费了。因此，生产是有价值的。\n储蓄创造了资本，而资本使生产扩大成为可能，所以储蓄起来的一美元对经济产生的积极影响要大于消费掉的一美元。对于这一点，你不必费力向经济学家或者政治家解释。第五章\n在鱼被指定为货币之后\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n在简单的经济社会中发挥作用的经济规律同样适用于复杂的经济社会……\n艾伯当初甘愿做出自我牺牲创造资本，也为岛上的其他居民带来了福祉。得益于艾伯精明的贷款计划，岛民制作了许多渔网，然后又利用生产力提高后所积累的资本制造更加有效的捕鱼器。生产力提高以后，不仅食物变得更加丰盛、服饰变得更加美观、交通变得更加便捷，而且人们也有了闲暇时间，冲浪运动风靡起来。\n很快，关于这种前所未有的奢华生活的传说就流传到了其他岛屿。那些岛屿上的人依然在徒手捕鱼，根本没有闲暇时间冲浪。为了追求更美好的生活，移民很快接踵而至。\n生产率提高意味着这座岛屿可以养活更多的人，反过来，更多的人又促成了更加多样化的经济。一些新到的移民找到了操作巨型捕鱼器的工作；另外一些移民向原住民借来多余的鱼，开垦土地，种植农作物——人们终于不用每天都吃鱼了；还有人利用贷款进入其他商业领域。\n岛上多元化的经济催生了很多职业，比如棚屋建筑工人、木筏制造工人、马车制造工人，包罗万象。\n岛上的食物和工具生产达到了很高的水平，一部分人不用生产物质资料也能生存。于是，服务业应运而生。\n为了改善食用鱼的味道，一些岛民发明了各种烹制鱼肉的方法，其中大多数都需要添加香料，用火烘焙。这些大厨收费很高，富裕的渔民和棚屋建筑工人用鱼换取他们用高超的厨艺烹制的美食。\n其他的服务性行业也很快发展起来了。冲浪的吸引力和社会效益得到了广泛认可，因此查理的后代建立了一所冲浪学校。\n随着社会的发展以及商业和服务业的不断延伸，人们需要一种交换的媒介，以支付给棚屋建筑工人、大厨和冲浪教练作为报酬。\n到目前为止，岛上实行的是物物交换。但是物物交换过程烦琐，效率较低。制矛师可能需要大厨的服务，但大厨却不需要一支矛。即便他们能各取所需，到底多少顿饭能和一支矛的价值相当呢？\n为了改变这种杂乱无章的交换系统，岛上需要新的交换物。这种交换物应该能用来交换任何物品、能被所有人接受。换句话说，岛民需要货币。\n鉴于岛上的所有人都吃鱼，鱼被指定为货币。\n很快，所有的工资和价格都开始用鱼计量。因为人们仍然假设每天需要吃一条鱼才能生存，所以一条鱼的价值是多少，所有人心里都有数。也就是说，岛上的价格体系和鱼的真实（或者固有）价格相关。\n效率与通货紧缩\n在一个经济体中，如果工人们有所分工，从事不同的商业和服务活动，其结果一定会比所有人都做同一种工作要好。分工增加产量，高产量又能提高生活水平。\n假设每个岛民平均要花5天时间才能造成一条独木舟，再假设每个岛民每天（使用渔网）可以捕获两条鱼，也就是说每个岛民必须放弃10条鱼的收入才能造出一条独木舟。然而，我们假设有一个叫“达菲”的人，他在伐木、搬运和木工技术方面略胜一筹，只需4天就能造出一条独木舟。那么对他而言，与其像别人一样捕鱼还不如专门做独木舟。如果他专门制造独木舟的话，会生活得更好。因为他只需放弃8条鱼的收入，用这些时间制造一条独木舟，然后再以9条鱼的价格把它卖掉，就可以从中获利。分工以后，他的收入增加了。\n因为达菲具有这些优势，其他的岛民花9条鱼向他购买独木舟是划算的。如果他们自己制造独木舟的话，就必须放弃10条鱼的收入。向专业人士支付9条鱼，他们可以省下1条鱼。\n但是，假设9条鱼是个相当高的价格——毕竟能有多少人存有那么多的鱼呢？独木舟的价格太高了，只有最富裕的岛民才买得起。至于那些储蓄不足的人在他们攒够买独木舟的费用之前，只好游泳去捕鱼。\n假设达菲从事这项劳动多年以后，利用自己的积蓄制作了一些造船用的专门工具。就像他的老前辈艾伯那样，达菲也通过省吃俭用得到了资本设备（工具）。\n因为有了新的设备，我们假设达菲将工时缩短为两天。效率提高了，每条独木舟只需要定价为4条鱼就能达到收支平衡，而不是以前的8条。如果他把售价降为6条鱼（原价9条鱼），他每售出一条独木舟就可以获得更多的利润（以前的利润是一条鱼，现在是两条鱼），同时产量也能翻一番。\n达菲提高生产率，受益的不只是他自己，还有岛民。价格降低之后，更多的人买得起独木舟，因此他的顾客群也扩大了。\n由于生产率提高了（储蓄、创新和投资的结果），独木舟的价格便随之下降，更多顾客能够享受到拥有独木舟的好处。昔日富人独享的奢侈品也成了普通消费品。\n故事引申\n正如故事中所讲的那样，价格下降并没有损害达菲的利益。实际上，其他行业生产的产品的价格也随着生产率的提高而下降，达菲可以用赚得的鱼买到更多的东西。\n技术创新是个单向的过程。除非人们失去记忆，否则生产效率必然会越来越高。因此，价格具有随着时间推移而降低的趋势。\n持续下降的价格还会鼓励岛民储蓄，因为他们知道现在的鱼将来会更有价值。尽管听起来可能有些疯狂，不过省一条确实等于赚一条。这样一来，人们就愿意储蓄，也就有更多资本可用于贷款、资本投资、生产，最终带来更多消费。\n就业\n由于社会发展得更加复杂，越来越多的岛民决定为别人工作，以劳动换取报酬。\n劳动的价值通常取决于劳动者所使用的资本。资本越优化，劳动的价值就越大。例如，付出同样的劳动，你驾驶一辆推土机挖的坑要比你用铁锹挖的坑大得多。所以，最好利用可用的最优资本工作。\n故事引申\n尽管人们普遍认为最低薪资法规增加了低端工人的薪资，但实际上，这类法规只是增加了这个人群的求职难度。如果一个员工能够提供具有一定价值的服务，比如每小时价值8美元，那么不管有没有最低薪资的规定，雇主都会心甘情愿地支付这笔费用。法律不需要对薪资负责，需要对此负责的是员工本人。但如果这位员工只能提供每小时价值6美元的服务，那么在8美元的最低时薪规定下，这个人想谋得一份工作是极其困难的。毕竟，没有哪位雇主愿意亏钱雇用员工。这样一来，最低薪资法规使得低技能员工的工作机会越来越少。就业这件事就好比爬梯子，如果没有机会踏上第一级梯档，那些低薪资的员工也就无法获得继续向上攀爬所需的技能了。这一现状使许多人陷入生活拮据的窘境。那些将6美元时薪视为剥削的人在为自己的正义感而沾沾自喜，但诸位想一想，在时薪6美元的情况下就业总好过在时薪8美元的规定下失业吧。\n许多政客还喜欢自我标榜，认为自己促成了公平公正的工作环境，因为他们通过各类法规，要求雇主为员工提供强制休假、医疗保健、请病假以及休产假等各类权益，于是便居功自傲。但是在最低薪资制度下，使这些权益得以实现的是员工的生产力，而非那些法规。然而，这些要求却剥夺了员工的选择权：他们本可以在这些权益和更高的薪资之间做出选择，如果那些政客不强制雇主为员工提供上述待遇的话，他们是有可能拿到更高薪资的。诸如此类的规定，外加其他由雇用或解雇员工导致成本及法律风险增加的规定，只能导致越来越多的低技能劳动力漫天要价，从而把自己赶出就业市场。\n在自由社会中，所有居民都能判断哪些资本能最大限度地实现劳动价值。除了那些出于某种原因依然选择徒手捕鱼的人以外（也许是出于艺术上的原因），每个劳动者都有三种选择：\n1\\.省吃俭用，自制渔网。\n2\\.贷款购买渔网。\n3\\.为有渔网的人工作。\n鉴于选项一需要饿肚子，选项二需要担风险，大多数劳动者会选择选项三。他们只需给人打工，就能得到报酬。\n比如，新来的移民芬尼根是个很强壮的男人，做渔民就浪费了他的天赋，所以他决定专做生鱼搬运的工作。靠他强健的身体，芬尼根一天就能把100条鱼从海滩运到人们家中。他收取总额的2%作为运费，一天能赚两条鱼。\n莫里则利用贷款制造了一辆运鱼车。他的运鱼车公司成了芬尼根强劲的竞争对手。虽然莫里没有芬尼根强壮，但是他利用运鱼车每天能运送300条鱼。因为他的生产率高，他只收取总额的1%作为运费，这样他每天能赚三条鱼。因而，得益于他的资本，莫里收费更低，但是赚取的利润更多。\n由于没有自己的资本，芬尼根的处境很艰难。\n莫里看到了商机，他估计强壮的芬尼根如果使用运鱼车，每天应该可以运送400条鱼，从而获得4条鱼的利润（收取总额的1%作为运费）。于是莫里向芬尼根提供这份工作，每天付给他三条鱼的报酬。剩余的一条鱼是莫里每天的收入。\n如果芬尼根接受这份工作，他就可以提高生产率，降低运费，比自己干更划算。\n莫里现在每天有一条鱼的收入，他可以不必再做运送工作，专心制造运鱼车，而且可以雇用更多的人以扩大生意。与此同时，运鱼车的普及也会降低所有岛民的运费支出。\n将来某一天，芬尼根可能储蓄足够多的鱼，制造自己的运鱼车，进而和他的老东家竞争。为了防止此类事情发生，莫里不得不支付给芬尼根合适的报酬，比他自己干赚得多，但不会多到让他产生自立门户的想法。\n虽然大家都得到了好处，但莫里唯一的动机是追求更高的利润。他并不是有意帮助芬尼根，但他的行为产生了这种效果。结果是芬尼根得到了更高的工资，所有人都降低了运费成本。\n有人认为商业利益源于降低员工的薪资。但没有人会免费工作，没有利益，工作也便无从谈起。员工只要工作就有报酬，而企业主想得到回报则只能等到企业赢利，他们的收益是对承担风险的回报，也是对成功整合稀有资源的回报。对利润的不懈追求推动了产品创新、企业发展与经济增长。正是这样的推动力提高了每个人的生活水平。丰厚的利润正说明一个企业很擅长满足客户的需要，对这样的企业应当予以鼓励，而不应恶意诋毁。\n故事引申\n有人认为，就业市场本身就有失公平，政府需要保护员工免受雇主的剥削。这种想法对经济学的基本原理存在误解，严重损害了劳动力市场的健康运行。\n与自由社会中的任何交易一样，就业是一项自愿的活动。如果人们通过自食其力或受其他雇主雇用能够挣到更多的钱，就很少有人愿意接受或继续一项工作了。每个工作的人实际上都在经营着自己的生意，将自己的劳动力卖给出价最高的雇主。有时（拿自由的水池清洁工来说），他们将劳动力卖给不同的顾客；有时（就大多数工作者来说），他们只将劳动力卖给某一个顾客，即他们的雇主。水池清洁工能够自由选择，为出价更高的顾客工作（或者在他掌握了新技能后，转行做报酬更高的服务工作）。同样，上班族如果有机会，也可以跳槽，去追求薪资更丰厚的工作。上班族没有跳槽，就证明他们目前的工作可能是当前所拥有的最好选择。低报酬可能不尽如人意，但这并不意味着剥削。\n一名员工的具体价值主要取决于三个方面：需求（雇主是否需要这名员工所掌握的技能）、供应（有多少人具备这些技能）以及生产力（这名员工对那些任务的完成程度如何）。要想获得较高的薪资，这位员工必须提高其自身价值，要么掌握极少数人具备的急需技能（如医生），要么通过对本职工作精益求精来提高生产力，根本无捷径可走。\n现实链接\n对通货紧缩的完全妖魔化（还有对通货膨胀的相对接受）是当今经济学中最成功的宣传策略。在经济学家和政治家眼中，通货紧缩被定义为一段时间内价格的全面下降，就好像经济领域的鼠疫一样。只要有一丁点儿通货紧缩的苗头，政府通常就会采取措施抬高物价。\n价格下降有什么不好呢？我们已经习惯了不断上涨的物价，要是我们知道在过去的将近150年（从18世纪末一直到1913年）中，美国的物价一直在稳步下降，几乎所有人都会大吃一惊。然而，就是在这段时间里，我们经历了人类历史上经济增长最快的几个阶段。\n这种现象出现的原因正如本章所讲述的那样，是因为生产率的提高。如果货币供应稳定（就像美联储成立前的美国那样），生产率的提高会促使价格下降。\n工业革命带来了生产率的大幅提高，工薪阶层也能买得起装饰家具、量身定做的衣服，付得起水管维修费和乘车费，而这些以前只有富人才消费得起。通货紧缩意味着1850年时存下的100美元到了1880年能够购买更多的产品和服务。为什么说通货紧缩不是件好事呢？现在，爷爷奶奶总爱说他们小时候东西多便宜，而他们的爷爷奶奶却总是说自己小时候东西要贵得多。\n虽然物价低的好处显而易见，但我们还是害怕通货紧缩。我们被告知：一旦物价下跌，消费者就会停止消费，公司也会避免支出，工人会因此失业，最后我们会回到经济的黑暗时代。\n但是，价格下降并不一定会影响特定行业的发展，我们不止一次地见证过这一点。20世纪初，亨利·福特靠不断降低汽车的价格发了大财，他雇用的工人的工资是行业里最高的。举个更近的例子，虽然计算机的价格不断大幅下降，但是这个行业的赢利还是非常丰厚。产品价格的下跌并未阻挡计算机革新的步伐。由于设计和制造效率的提高，每年有数亿人能够以越来越低的价格享受数字化带来的好处。\n尽管如此，大多数人都认为通货紧缩只有在局限于某个行业时才是可以接受的。为什么呢？\n现代经济学错误地认为：消费促进经济增长，因而一旦发生通货紧缩，人们就不愿意消费（这样价格就会继续下降），而如果人们继续消费，价格下降的影响就会减弱。真是荒谬。\n正如我们前面讲的那样，起决定作用的不是消费，而是生产！\n不需要劝说人们消费，因为人类的需求永远不会得到满足。如果人们不想要某样东西，那一定是有理由的，要么是产品不够好，要么是买不起。不管是因为什么，推迟购买产品，或者把要花的钱存起来，都是出于理性的考虑，而且对整个社会都有好处。\n实际上，如果消费者不愿意消费，刺激需求最好的办法就是让物价降到更合理的水平。山姆·沃尔顿就是运用这个简单的概念赚了数百亿美元。\n第一代等离子电视问世时，极少有美国人购买。尽管大家都想要一台，可一万美元的不菲价格却令许多人望而却步。但价格下跌时，越来越多的人果断出手，争相购买。不断增加的销量弥补了价格下跌带来的损失，于是利润大幅提高。\n天资敏锐的经济学家总会说，价格下降会损害众多消费者的利益。可食品与能源价格降低真的很糟糕么？医保花销或者教育投入逐渐回到可承受范围内，难道我们还会要求政府采取行动以规避相关风险么？\n虽然有这么多反面证据，通货紧缩还是被当作经济的头号敌人。这是因为通货紧缩（与通货膨胀相反）是政治家最好的朋友。这一点我们在后面会详细说明。第六章\n为什么会有储蓄\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n随着岛民储存的鱼越来越多，鱼的存储成了问题。以前，人们习惯把鱼存放在家里，但是这样做效率很低甚至很危险。偷鱼贼也成了一个大问题。\n虽然岛民愿意通过贷款和投资使自己多余的鱼增值，但是大多数人既没有时间也没有能力判断某项商业计划的优劣。\n一个名叫“迈克斯·郝寅航”（Max Goodbank）的人嗅到了商机，他决定开拓一个革命性的行业。\n迈克斯守护自己的存鱼多年，深知必须找到一种更好的储存方式才行。看到自己的邻居被狡猾的借鱼者欺骗，他也认识到大多数人在借出积蓄的问题上都需要帮助。考虑到这些因素，他建造了一个很大的储藏室，其温度和湿度都可以调节，还雇用了岛上最强壮的人看守。这家新“银行”能够确保岛上存鱼的安全，从而解决存鱼失窃的问题。但这只是个开始……\n迈克斯是位真正的企业家，他知道如果只是收取保管费，利润空间很有限。\n他明白储蓄的价值，也明白自己比一般的岛民更擅长放贷。迈克斯是一流的数学家，尤其善于评估商业计划并为之提供适当的贷款。\n他用邻居的储蓄放贷，所获收益的一部分作为储户的利息和看守人员的工资，剩下的部分作为自己的利润。\n于是郝寅航存贷款公司就这样诞生了。\n与艾伯和达菲一样，迈克斯最初只是想为自己谋利。但是在他追逐利益的同时，也解决了存款、贷款和盗窃这些棘手的问题。\n现在，岛上的居民们节衣缩食，把积蓄存入迈克斯的银行，让他替自己承担投资的责任。\n谁要是有投资项目需要贷款，只要去找迈克斯就可以了，不用去找那些可能拥有大量存鱼的人。\n要让计划顺利实施，迈克斯需要解决几个问题。第一，他必须保证贷款业务赢利，这也就意味着他必须仔细甄选合适的借款人，认真收取利息，而且当对方无法还款时取消抵押品的赎回权。\n第二，他需要定期向储户支付利息，让他们高兴。第三，为了让生意持续下去，他需要吸引更多的储户。如果失败，他就会失业，他的投资也就白费了。\n因为迈克斯精通贷款业务，凡他经手的贷款不仅效率高，而且利润丰厚，所以他自然而然成了岛上的经济权威。其他不够专业的岛民总会受到个人经历、家庭关系和情感的影响，迈克斯却可以心无旁骛地关注经济问题。\n利率\n由于迈克斯的个人利益和银行的经营状况密切相关，他最适合决定存款和贷款的利率。\n在贷款方面，他对最可靠的（还款能力最强的）借款人收取最低利率，对风险较高的借款人收取较高的利率作为高风险的补偿。\n贷款利率又决定了银行能支付给储户的利息。存款利率是随存款年限递增的。存款年限越长，造成银行存鱼短缺的风险越低。因此，如果储户愿意长期储蓄，获得的利率也就较高，进行短期储蓄的储户所获利率则较低。\n尽管迈克斯掌握着利率的制定权，但是整体利润还是会随着无法掌控的市场情况的变化而波动。\n有时生产率大幅提高，岛上的存鱼量也随之大大增加。如果储藏室里堆满了鱼，银行就会主动降低贷款利率。因为此时银行承受损失的能力较强，而且健康的经济也为新企业的发展提供了良好的环境。\n由于不需要吸引新的储蓄，贷款利率也比较低，这就导致存款利率降低，从而抑制储蓄。\n一旦储蓄回落（这对经济来说很危险），相反的力量就开始发挥作用，鼓励储蓄，从而补充银行的资产。\n当存鱼较少时，迈克斯放贷就格外谨慎。因为在储蓄不足的情况下，一旦有人拖欠贷款，后果将非常严重。为了抵消高风险可能带来的损失，迈克斯会向借款人收取更高的利率，并提高存款利率以刺激储蓄。\n高利率会抑制借贷，延缓经济增长。但同时，高利率也能刺激储蓄。最终，银行资产会再次积累起来，到那时利率又会下降。\n另外，较低的存款率表明人们更愿意将储蓄用于近期消费，因而抑制了为满足未来消费需求而进行的投资。\n这种周期性的利率机制有利于市场稳定。该机制的运作完全取决于以下三点：银行实现资产回报最大化的愿望、银行对高风险投资损失的担忧、个人消费的时间偏好。\n更重要的是，银行储蓄的安全与便捷促使人们增加储蓄、延迟消费，从而为投资项目提供资金，有助于增加未来的产量并提高生活水平。\n在迈克斯精明谨慎的经营之下，岛上的储蓄不断增长，商业不断发展。\n高风险投资\n由于迈克斯需要不断向储户支付利息，他往往会避免发放违约风险较高的贷款。他拒绝发放度假贷款、消费贷款以及其他仅用于消费享乐的贷款。这类借款人总是夸下海口，却拿不出实际的证据证明他们将来能够还贷，所以迈克斯不能拿岛民的储蓄冒险。\n但是，有些储户甘愿为了高回报承担高风险。偶尔会出现一些有潜在突破性的项目，非常诱人，但是最后银行还是因风险过大而不愿投资。\n弹射飞行航空公司提出了一个设想，可能会彻底改变岛际旅行方式。\n但是，循规蹈矩的迈克斯不肯投资。\n然而，这并不表示弹射飞行的支持者束手无策了。\n一个新的联合投资组织出现了。该组织由阔绰的大亨曼尼·季金（Manny Fund）运营。曼尼从那些对银行存款利率不满意的储户那里募集存鱼，然后再把募集到的鱼投入备受瞩目的项目。\n有些项目成功了，比如天堂饮品公司。\n另一些项目则失败了，比如布拉潜艇水下旅游公司。\n迈克斯继续通过保守的投资方式促进资本增长，而曼尼则成了冒险者的选择。\n现实链接\n政府不但制定法律，向某些贷款类型和人群倾斜，扰乱了信贷市场，还通过另一种更加根本的方式影响信贷流动：操控利率。在将近100年中，美联储（理论上是一家私有银行，但实际上却是美国财政部的延伸）一直制定基准利率，而美国的整个利率结构就是建立在基准利率之上的。\n美联储调高或调低联邦基金利率并不会直接决定某家银行每种贷款的利率，但会影响整个市场走高或走低。通常，银行向大众收取的利率要高于它们支付给美联储的贷款利率。因此，当美联储调高或调低其基准利率时，企业和个人在借贷时就要多付或者少付一些钱。\n美联储之所以被授予这一权力，是为了保证经济不论在繁荣期还是萧条期都能平稳运行。其理论基础是：美联储的经济学家可以运用集体智慧，推算出特定时段最理想的利率水平，从而使经济正常运行。\n例如，美联储可以把利率降到足够低，这样企业和个人就更愿意借贷，以此刺激不景气的经济。而在经济繁荣时，由于过分的自信经常导致愚蠢的行为，美联储应该提高利率，这样人们在借贷时就会三思而后行。\n这个机制有两个致命的缺陷。\n第一，该机制的前提是：美联储的一小撮人要比数百万独立决断的民众（或者叫“市场”）更清楚什么是恰当的利率水平。但是，美联储跟利率没有任何关系。它既不产生储蓄，也不会因为贷款变成坏账而蒙受损失。积累储蓄的是民众，而且银行能否获利取决于自身的管理水平。如果没有这种关联，借贷必然是低效的。\n第二，美联储的决定总是基于政治考量而非经济因素。因为低利率能够使经济表面上表现更好，降低还款压力，还能帮金融公司赚钱，所以很多人都喜欢低利率。谋求连任的总统往往鼓吹更低的利率，并对美联储施压。对于美联储的决策者来说，他们自然也希望自己被看作拯救经济的好人，而不愿被当作将经济推向低谷的吝啬鬼。\n乐于看到高利率的社会成员（尤其是储户）没有形成有组织的利益集团，没人听取他们的声音。因此，社会上就形成了这种偏见，即利率应该很低，而不是很高。但是要记住，低利率会刺激借贷、抑制储蓄，难怪美国已经由一个储蓄者的国家转变成了借款人的国家。\n而且，相对于储蓄供给来说，过低的利率会向借款人传达错误的信号，即经济状况良好、投资可行。因为消费并没有真正延后（如果利率顺应市场下滑，消费就应该延后），用于满足未来需求的投资就很难成功。结果就是虚假的繁荣过后紧接着出现巨大的危机，正如我们刚刚在股票和房地产市场上经历的那样。第七章\n基础设施与贸易\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n以前岛民都饮用山间溪水，他们用各种容器把水从小溪运到自己的棚屋里。\n因此，大多数人都不会选择在远离水源地的地方生活或者工作，缺水的状况也使农业发展受阻。这些因素都限制了小岛的整体生产力水平。\n有一年，小岛上发生了非常严重的旱灾，不少溪流干涸了。缺水严重，人们几乎无法生存。\n灾难过后，岛民们想寻找一种解决办法，以防止日后再发生类似的灾害。\n聪明的渔民艾伯五世（艾伯的第五代孙）解决了这个难题。他注意到，雨水形成的洪流会聚积起来形成水塘。受到大自然的启发，他设计了一个雨水收集系统，将雨水储存起来以备将来之用。但是，为整个岛屿提供水源将是一项巨大的工程。\n按照他的设想，自来水厂项目需要182 500条鱼的工程款，这些鱼可供250名工人食用两年。于是，他向曼尼·季金借款。曼尼很喜欢这个想法，但是他没有足够的鱼。于是艾伯五世做了最坏的打算，向银行借鱼。\n出乎他的意料，马可欣·郝寅航（迈克斯·郝寅航的后代）表示对这个贷款项目很感兴趣。尽管工程费用很高，但考虑到未来的潜在收益，冒一次险也是值得的。如果这个项目成功的话，银行很快就能收回成本，而且岛上的所有人都会有更美好的未来。\n然而，不管她多么喜欢这个主意，如果岛上的存鱼不够，郝寅航也无力支持这个项目。而岛上的确没有足够的存鱼可以供250个不捕鱼的工人食用两年。\n但是竣工之时，自来水厂如广告中宣称的那样送来了水，并归还了贷款和利息。\n岛民也愿意每年付出一定数量的鱼来换取自来水。自来水厂用这笔钱雇用了100多名工人维护这个复杂的供水系统。\n自来水厂项目取得的巨大成功给整个岛屿的经济带来了好处。自来水服务收费合理，让远离水源的地方也能用上水，以前的不毛之地也可以种庄稼了。\n水管内水流平稳，可以用来推动机器，这就催生了新的产业。\n由于人们现在不需要再用手提水，每个人都有更多的时间用于生产产品、提供服务或者开发新的投资项目。高生产率使得全社会的捕鱼量上升，生活水平也随之提高。\n故事引申\n现在岛上的社会比当初只有三个人徒手捕鱼时要大得多了。在一些人看来，支配经济的原理已经改变了。事实果真如此吗？\n正如数学原理不会因问题的大小而改变，基本经济原理也不会因经济的大小而改变。人们常常认识不到这一点，是因为在储户和借款人之间存在着很多层关系。但是，自我牺牲、储蓄、借贷、投资、经济刺激因素和社会经济发展之间的关系是永远不变的。\n贸易\n随着岛上经济的发展，出口产品的能力也增强了。很快，不少大型货运木筏就满载着鱼、运鱼车、冲浪板、长矛和独木舟驶过公海。由于物美价廉，这些产品在整个大洋上都享有盛誉。人们用它们换取了鲜鱼和其他以前从未在小岛上见过的商品。\n由于岛上的探险者和其他岛屿建立了联系，贸易得到了发展，进一步促进了经济的增长。如果自由贸易不受限制地自由发展，就会给所有人带来好处。\n有些岛屿（或者城市、国家甚至个人）通常会有一些产品相对过剩，而别的岛屿正好缺乏这类产品。于是，每个人、每个国家或者岛屿都会利用自己的优势实现利益最大化。\n比如，附近有座小鼓岛，你可能猜到了，岛上有大量的小鼓。当地人制作小鼓的技艺登峰造极，而且岛上长满了最适合制作鼓的树。因此，岛上的小鼓不计其数，价格也很低廉。作为岛内贸易品，小鼓的销路不畅。\n离小鼓岛100公里的地方有座狂舞岛，岛上的居民对小鼓情有独钟。不幸的是，这座岛上没有适合制作小鼓的树。因此，在狂舞岛上，小鼓是罕见而珍贵的货物。狂舞岛上有大量的椰子防晒油，但是岛上的居民皮肤黝黑，没有必要防晒，因此防晒油对他们来说几乎一文不值。\n也许是命运使然，在岛上无情的烈日下，皮肤白皙的小鼓岛人备受慢性灼伤的煎熬。\n在这两座岛屿取得联系后，立即展开了小鼓和防晒油的大宗交换。每座岛屿都利用自身的优势把在岛外售价更高的货物运往另一座岛屿。在这种交换安排中，两座岛屿都受益。人们的生活水平提高了，节奏感很强的鼓声响彻两座岛屿。\n国际贸易与个人劳动分工没有什么区别。每个人或者每个国家都用自己多余的或者擅长生产的产品，换取自己缺乏的或者不擅长生产的产品。\n现实链接\n基础设施建设投资会对经济产生巨大的影响。然而，只有在收益大于支出时，这种投资才有效果。反之，这些项目就是在浪费资源并阻碍经济增长。\n目前，很多政治家和经济学家都错误地认为：基础设施建设投资并不是可能带来长期收益的投资，而是增加就业和提振经济的直接手段。\n在过去的半个世纪里，美国对基础设施建设的投入远远不够。弥补这个缺口对于目前的经济状况而言无疑是一种负担。我们将来才能看到这些投资的收益，而且前提是投资必须成功。\n在我们的故事中，借给自来水厂项目的182 500条鱼就不能再用于其他能够创造就业岗位的投资项目了。其实那个机会不错。假如这些鱼被用在了一个毫无价值的项目上，比如阿拉斯加臭名昭著的“绝路桥”，那就浪费了岛上的储蓄，白费了250名工人两年的辛勤劳动。\n在美国早期的历史上，类似自来水厂这样的项目往往是由私营部门发起的。然而，由于这些项目能否成功很难预料，在这个政府几乎控制了一切基础设施建设的时代，这样一个工程的融资、建设直到最后投入运营都由以营利为目的的私营公司完成，看起来很不可思议。但是在过去事实就是如此。\n举例来说，纽约地铁基本上就是由私营公司建设的，而且在近40年的时间里都是由私营公司负责运营。虽然地铁的造价不菲，但还是实现了赢利。更值得一提的是，40年里车票价格从未上涨。\n现如今，选民很容易相信大型公共设施都应该由政府运营，比如下水道、高速公路、运河和桥梁这些可以为所有人提供方便的设施。\n政治家们成功地让民众相信，唯利是图的私营公司一有机会就会榨取民众的血汗钱。他们用来证明这些论点的证据多半都是从情感上煽动，引起民众的共鸣。其实我们更能确定的是，政府对于公共设施和服务的垄断几乎必然会造成效率低下和贪污腐败。\n如果政府工程入不敷出且服务质量很差，自由市场的原则也无法帮助其走出困境。政府通常会通过提高税收填补漏洞。这样一来，不仅浪费了社会资源，也降低了人们的生活水平。\n在贸易上，人们也有同样的错误理念。自由贸易的反对者试图保护美国的就业岗位不受海外竞争的影响，但是他们忽略了进口的好处，忽视了限制选择范围对消费者造成的潜在损失。\n比如，如果进口的T恤衫比美国本土生产的T恤衫便宜，那么美国人就可以在T恤衫上少花一些钱。省下来的钱可以用于生产别的东西，比如滑板。这对于美国国内的公司，比如优秀滑板制造商，是很有利的，对那些能够输送其最有价值产品的公司也是有利的。\n可是美国国内那些制作T恤衫的失业工人怎么办呢？如果他们的雇主不能在生产T恤衫上找到竞争优势，这些工人只能去找别的工作。但是，提供就业岗位并非经济的目的。经济的目的是不断提高生产力。\n保留无效率的劳动力和资本使用方式对整个社会是没有好处的。如果美国在T恤衫生产方面没有竞争优势，那么它就应该找到自己具有优势的行业。\n如果通过贸易壁垒保护这些就业岗位，制造T恤衫的成本还是会居高不下，那么人们就没有更多的钱购买滑板（举例来讲），滑板制造商就会蒙受损失。所以，这种做法虽然保留了上述就业岗位，但我们却没有看到那些因此失去的潜在岗位。\n浪费劳动力制造那些国外生产率更高的产品是毫无意义的。如果我们专注于生产自己擅长制造的产品，就可以用它们换取别人擅长制造的产品，最终能得到更多。\n当然，问题在于，因为有了那些人为设置的高汇率、高税率，以及工资法和劳动法，美国占优势的领域并不多。这个局面需要改变。第八章\n一个共和国就这样诞生了\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n一开始，岛上没有政府。艾伯、贝克和查理三人是老朋友，所以总能以和平的方式解决问题。但是，随着简单的社会发展为更加复杂的社会，人们必然需要某些政府机构。\n岛上的人越来越多，人们之间的误解也大大增加。一旦这些误解无法通过谈判解决，人们就会诉诸武力。\n因为没有组织有序的共同防御团体，偷鱼贼有时会成群结队而来，在岛上横行霸道，岛民们苦不堪言。\n时不时地，小鼓岛人也会入侵，他们不仅是优秀的鼓师，还是凶猛的强盗。一旦他们发威，岛上就一条鱼也剩不下了。\n很明显，岛民需要联合起来，共同维护自己的安全。他们需要领导者，但是交出权力永远是件冒险的事。人们一旦拥有了权力，往往就会滥用。\n岛民试着选了许多领导者，但选出的人不是自以为是，就是不堪重任。于是他们决定组建一个对人民负责的政府，政府无权剥夺人们的自由，正因为有了自由，这座小岛才实现如今的蓬勃发展。最后大家决定：选举12名参议员组成参议院，其中包括一名能够行使行政权力的议长。\n为保护岛屿不受外敌侵略，参议院决定建立并监管一支海军，由装备长矛的独木舟组成。\n为了维护社会稳定，也为了保护岛民的生命权、自由权和财产权，参议院决定设立一套法院体系来解决纠纷，同时成立警察小队执行法官的法令。\n为了促进贸易，参议院决定建立并维护一系列的灯塔，以防岛上的峭壁妨碍海上交通。\n为了给这些基础的机构和设施提供资金支持，岛民们同意每年缴纳一些鱼作为税款。所有交给政府的鱼都会存放在银行的特别账户中，参议院会从这个账户支取资金用于公共支出。\n但是，因为岛上的居民都非常崇尚自由，很多人担心赋予极少数人过大的权力。\n为了确保参议员们不会滥用税款，人们制定了一部宪法，明确规定了参议院享有哪些权力。宪法中没有提及的权力仍旧属于普通民众。为防止人们对参议院的职权范围产生误解，法院系统设置了最高法官一职，负责维护宪法的权威并监督参议员们的行为。\n在投票通过宪法之后，这座岛就有了一个名字：美索尼亚国。\n新政府很明智，决定不把所有税款都花掉。在季风来临、无法捕鱼时，或者小鼓岛人发动新一轮袭击时，这些储蓄可以派上大用场。\n虽然政府确实用这些钱雇了一些人，比如灯塔看守、治安官、法官和海军桨手，但是大家都明白如果没有向政府纳税的社会生产者，这些职位根本不会存在；如果生产者不缴纳税款，政府雇员连饭都吃不上。\n故事引申\n岛民们知道政府的支出就是纳税人缴纳的税款，所以他们认为应该由纳税人决定税款怎么花。因此，只有纳税人可以投票。\n岛民们也明白税收降低了岛上可用的储蓄总额，限制了投资资本的供给，但是大多数岛民都认为更安全的环境、船只失事事件的减少和解决合同纠纷的法院系统所带来的好处远远大于他们所付出的代价。\n目前为止，一切都好。但是总会有些事情发生……\n现实链接\n美国建立在对政府权力严格限制的基础上，但是很遗憾，很少有美国人真正认识到这一点。美国的开国元勋们对盛行于17\\~18世纪的关于自由、理性和科学的革命性思想了然于胸，他们试图在人民与政府之间营造一种崭新的关系。在他们的设想中，主权在民，人权神圣不可侵犯。\n独立战争结束之初，为了建立国家政权（其实很多美国人并不希望这样），美国宪法成了一个设计巧妙的笼子，可以防止政府这个“野兽”发狂失控。宪法不仅防止人民免受政府的独裁统治，还防止少数人受到多数人的暴政的伤害。\n美国宪法有意将权力分配给联邦政府的不同部门，并把中央的权力下放到各州。更重要的是，宪法可以防止联邦政府从人民手中剥夺任何权利。\n结果，在这个国家里，人人可以享有人身自由权和财产权，可以随心所欲地处理个人资产，政府无权干涉。虽然并非每个人都能幸运地享有这些权利，但是这无损于这个设想展现出的勇气。毕竟，这是以前任何国家的法典中都不曾有过的。\n然而随着时间的推移，这个清晰的设想变得模糊了。危机爆发时，很多人都确信政府需要更多权力，人们可以牺牲一些自由。不幸的是，在目前的经济危机中，这个想法仍有不少支持者。\n我们渴望消除经济紧缩带来的痛苦，但是我们忘记了自由本身就是有风险的。如果政府有责任消除一切苦痛，那么就没有人是自由的。无法自由地失败，也就是无法自由地成功。第九章\n政府的职能开始转变了\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n在几代人的时间里，岛上的政府一直按照设想运行。很多睿智而又严于律己的人做过领袖，他们一直十分注重鼓励企业发展和个人储蓄。在此期间，税收负担相对较轻，对行业的管制也比较宽松。随着商品生产的增加，企业获利，价格稳定回落，购买力增强。在几代人的努力之后，几乎所有的家庭都拥有一条独木舟，有些家庭甚至有两三条。\n因为只需要少数熟练的渔民捕鱼便可以满足整个岛屿的营养需求，多出来的劳动力和资本就可以投入其他行业了。各种在捕鱼时代闻所未闻的工业和服务业都发展起来。棚屋装修公司、巫医医院和制鼓公司应运而生，蓬勃发展。岛上一片繁荣。西海岸还出现了一个剧团，人们对他们的首场演出《渔民来了》赞不绝口。\n与此同时，一些参议员基于情感原因认为，宪法中关于纳税与投票权的关系从根本上来说是非民主的。基于进步主义精神，这项规定被废除了，很多不太关心政府预算支出的人也获得了投票权。\n政府的工资支出随着经济增长而增加，参议员的社会地位也大大提高，这份工作变得非常有吸引力。本来只有德高望重的长者才能担任参议员，现在雄心勃勃、干劲十足的年轻人也对此趋之若鹜。\n渴望成为参议员的人当中有个名叫“弗兰基·迪普”的人，他比其他人更有创意。他注意到人们做事的一个特点，这为他以后登上权力顶峰提供了途径。\n他发现人们喜欢免费的东西，同理，人们痛恨纳税。因此，他想出了一个计划：如果他能找到一个方法让岛民们以为他免费给予了他们一些东西，那么他就能够得到无条件的支持。不幸的是，政府所有的一切都来自税款。参议员自己又不捕鱼，他们如果不索取就没法给予。怎么可能给予比索取的多呢？\n一次猛烈的季风过后，弗兰基看到了机遇（政治家从来不会浪费一次危机）。\n他鼓吹道：“亲爱的岛民们，我们刚刚经历的风暴给我们带来了无尽的苦难。很多人无家可归、饥肠辘辘，我们不能坐视不管。如果我当选，我会制订一个政府重建计划，帮助最需要的公民弥补损失。”他还向公民承诺，重建的费用由政府税款负担。\n他的竞争对手格鲁坡·克利夫兰仅仅承诺要好好管理岛上的储蓄，以及不干涉公民权利。\n毫无悬念，弗兰基·迪普顺利当选为议长。\n他的胜选并没有改变现状，岛上依然没有足够的储蓄支持他所设想的支出计划。为了弥补这个差距，弗兰基想出了另一个计划。政府可以发行纸币，叫作“鱼邦储备券”，用这种纸币可以到郝寅航那里自由兑换政府储存的鱼。居民们可以立即把纸币兑换成鱼，也可以用纸币购买产品和服务，就像使用真鱼一样。\n岛上的首席大法官看不过去了，便插手进来。他指出，根据宪法，参议院无权为了某个公民的利益收取另一个公民的钱财，也无权发行纸币代替真鱼。\n弗兰基随即免了他的职，并任命自己的一个政治伙伴担任大法官一职。由此解决了这个问题。这位政治上的合作伙伴宣称宪法是“灵活的文件”，后代子孙会遇到建国时期的渔民们无法预见的问题，所以宪法的内容是可以根据新形势来解读的。\n刚开始，公民们还不太习惯使用鱼邦储备券，他们习惯于用真鱼购买东西。但是一段时间以后，纸币就流行起来了。大多数人都不得不承认纸币比鱼更易于携带，而且没有难闻的气味。\n同时，弗兰基的顾问们全力搜寻岛上值得投资的项目（当然，目的很明确）。如果某项计划可以确保得到潜在选民足够的支持，他们就拨款支持建设。\n银行的新总裁迈克斯·郝寅航七世对新钞票没什么好感。他认为新钞票印刷十分容易，这会给参议员们带来一种危险的刺激。而且，只有政府在银行里储存足够的鱼，让人们可以兑换所有的钞票，他晚上才能睡得安稳。\n不出所料，郝寅航七世的信心没能持续多长时间。\n很快，弗兰基和他的代理人就发放了很多鱼邦储备券，数量远远超过政府账户里的存鱼。郝寅航七世注意到不断缩水的储备，于是跑去提醒参议院。\n“弗兰基，马上停止印钞！”他喊道，“你们每发行10张钞票，我都只有9条鱼可以兑换。如果储户发现我们没有足够的鱼可以兑换，他们就会蜂拥到银行来兑现，那时我就没有存鱼啦。你必须停止发行鱼邦储备券，并提高税率。我们必须恢复储备。”\n弗兰基和他的高级顾问休伊·陀贝及泰德·额奈摩尼听罢都哈哈大笑起来。“调高税率，缩减支出……亏你想得出来！你要是参加竞选，肯定是一把好手！还有别的什么好主意吗？”\n郝寅航解释道：“对不起，各位。可是我实在别无选择。一旦岛上的储户意识到把鱼存在银行不安全，他们就会停止储蓄。他们会像从前那样把鱼堆在家里。那样的话，我们就没有足够的资本维持我们现在赖以生存的设施，更没有资金投资新的项目了！我们的整个经济就会崩溃！”\n“听好了，杞人忧天的家伙！”弗兰基说道，“我们早就想到了这一点，我们有应对之策。为什么要让储户知道他们的储蓄在缩水而不是增值呢？”\n弗兰基解释道：“我的经济顾问都是新大学的高才生，大学里也有不少顶级的科学家。他们想出了很棒的办法，而且他们真的成功了。是让你知道一点儿小秘密的时候了。让技师们进来。”\n说罢，几个穿着实验服的科学家拿着三条看起来很普通的鱼走了进来。“请看！”其中一个人说道，“我们找遍了海滩和垃圾场，收集被人扔掉的鱼皮和鱼骨——尤其是有完整的鱼头和鱼尾的那种。看好了，我给你变个魔术。”\n接着，技师们熟练地切割、拼接、黏合和缝纫，让人眼花缭乱。不一会儿，他们就开始在鱼骨上添加鱼肉，制作一条新的鱼。他们调整、造型、黏合，最后缝合。通过这种方法，他们用三条鱼制作出了四条像模像样的鱼。它们刚才还是垃圾，现在看起来就像真的鱼一样！\n弗兰基说：“秘诀就在于胶水，粘好后永远不会脱落。做出的鱼能一直维持原状，而那些傻蛋们——我是说——民众永远也不会发现。我们会称这种新鱼为‘官鱼’，然后把它们交给储户。让我的技师们到你的保险库忙上几天，存鱼危机不就解决了嘛！”\n郝寅航惊呆了。他不得不承认这个骗术很高明。他的脸上渐渐露出了微笑。他受够了总是向别人说“不”的日子，那样太没意思，没人喜欢他——人们背地里都叫他“吝啬鬼”。\n“也许这是个办法！”他暗想，“也许这是我受到大家欢迎的契机。首先我得到鱼，然后是权力，然后是女人！”\n但是，理智告诉他，这些人不是魔术师，鱼也不是大风刮来的！参议员们所做的只是通过削减岛上储蓄的价值制造假鱼。他试图和他们讲道理。\n“听我说，储户有一天会明白过来的。你看，你们的官鱼跟真鱼比起来明显要小。毕竟，岛上的人一直以来都在吃鱼，大家都知道一条鱼的价值是多少，骗他们没那么容易。”\n弗兰基试图打消郝寅航的担忧，他用老到的语气说道：“我们已经考虑到了。所以，一开始官鱼不会太小。每10条我们会用9条真鱼来做，这样做出的鱼只比真鱼小10%。另外，也是最天才的部分，我们会立法禁止岛民比较官鱼和真鱼。”\n泰德·额奈摩尼插嘴道：“对，就是这样。我们会说科学家们在未经处理的鱼里发现了新的病毒，并要求所有人一旦捕到鱼就交由官方做消毒处理！”\n参议员和技师会告诉人们，消毒过程是怎么使官鱼吃起来没有以前那么饱腹的。\n为了防止人们看到真鱼，也为了从表面上增加捕鱼量，参议员们决定设立渔业部，它的唯一职责就是捕鱼。\n郝寅航再也听不下去了。“这行不通！如果人们停止捕鱼，而是依赖于政府，那我们的捕鱼总量就会下降，最终我们会把储蓄用尽的。”\n“你怎么这么肯定？”弗兰基反问道，“成立渔业部是大势所趋。我们会让最可靠的人做经理，还会向表现出最佳公民精神的工人颁发特别奖品。而且，我们只需要坚持到下次选举结束。在那之后，我们会想出一个更长远的计划——我保证我们会想出来的。”\n休伊·陀贝接过话道：“与此同时，这个新的鱼增值步骤会给你提供足够的鱼，用来支付储户的利息。我们甚至还可以剩下一些鱼，用在公益事业方面！”\n郝寅航想了一会儿说：“还是行不通。人们总有一天会明白过来，他们会担心自己的储蓄，因而取出存款。”\n“这一点我们也想到了。”弗兰基解释说，“我们将宣布所有储蓄将由一个叫作‘鱼邦存款保险公司’的新政府机构承保。一旦得知参议员们为他们的存款担保，还有谁会取回存款呢？保险机制形成以后，储户就会认为我们在保护他们的存款，即便我们实际上是在窃取存款的价值。”\n“那么，迈克斯。”弗兰基靠近他，在他的肩膀上捏了一把，问道，“你会和我们一起干，对吧？”\n迈克斯受到诱惑，一度想和他们同流合污，但他最后还是挺直了腰板。政治家们担心的是表面上的偿付能力和他们自己的形象，而迈克斯关心的是鱼的价值。\n“白日做梦！”他厉声说道，“这是欺诈！如果说你们这些参议员有什么共同点，那就是你们全是骗子！想让我和你们同流合污？我这就回去关闭银行，让人们把鱼存在家里。”\n在他发表这番攻击性言论的过程中，参议员们面面相觑，无奈地耸肩，最后他们忍无可忍了。弗兰基叫来了警卫，他跟警卫耳语了几句，郝寅航就被拖了出去。郝寅航双脚乱蹬，大声呼喊，但是他临别前的话谁也没听进去。\n“没办法，对牛弹琴。”弗兰基说，“去把阿里·格林芬叫来！”\n随后，弗兰基任命格林芬为银行的新主席，他严令格林芬执行鱼增值计划，丝毫不许打折扣。后来，郝寅航存贷款公司改名为“鱼邦储备银行”。\n第二天早上，有人发现岛上信誉最好的银行家迈克斯·郝寅航七世的尸体挂在珊瑚礁上。他的死被说成是自然死亡。岛上的高层假惺惺地发表了悼词。弗兰基议长为他举办了隆重的葬礼。\n因为有阿里·格林芬做鱼邦储备银行的主席，他们的计划进行得滴水不漏。从真鱼向官鱼的转变完成了……\n那个星期之后，很少有岛民意识到，随着迈克斯被埋葬，银行业的可信赖的传统和健全的货币也一起被埋葬了。\n现实链接\n我们前面讨论过，在美国历史上的大多数时期，通货紧缩持续存在。1913年，美联储成立。美联储发行纸币，承诺纸币持有者可以随时将其兑换成黄金，从而取代了当时流通的私营银行发行的钞票。其实，私营银行也做出了相似的担保。但是，自从美联储登上历史舞台，美国的物价就开始不断上涨。\n成立美联储的最初目的是形成“弹性货币供应”。当时的设想是：美联储可以根据经济活动的情况，扩大或收紧货币流通量。设计者以为这样可以让物价保持平稳，不受繁荣或萧条的影响。\n即便这一设想是个好想法，很明显美联储在这个任务上已经一败涂地。\n在过去的100年里，美元损失了超过95%的价值。这可真够稳定的！事实上，美联储现在存在的唯一目的就是产生足够的通货膨胀，从而使政府的支出大于税收收入。\n在“大萧条”中，罗斯福总统决定让美元对黄金贬值。要想实现这一点，美国政府就必须控制整个黄金市场，而且美国政府还一度立法禁止私人拥有金币。后来，要将纸币兑换成黄金，人们只能去公正的银行，后来只能去公正的外国银行，再后来去哪里也兑换不了了。\n美国人手里只剩下一种没有实际价值且可以随意增发的货币。这使得美国政府再也不必在支出和税收之间做出艰难抉择，也把美国经济引上了一条不归路，总有一天美元剩余的那点儿可怜的价值也会消失。第十章\n不断缩水的鱼就像货币一样\nHOW

CRASHES\n参议员们都无法相信自己的好运。现在，他们可以随意做出任何竞选承诺了，再也不必维持收支平衡，也不需要通过提高税率为支出筹钱了。\n因此，每年政府都发行数量超过银行中可兑换的鱼的鱼邦储备券。一旦储蓄偏低，技师们就施展他们魔法般的技艺。这一切是如此令人兴奋。虽然参议员们心中痛苦挣扎，想要控制局面，让国家回到一条可持续发展的道路上，但是他们就是无法控制自己。\n一些政府拨款支持的项目使大家受益。岛上的海军换了大船，让小鼓岛人无法靠近，新的道路系统使交通更加便利。然而，充满争议的清洗石块就业计划有多大价值就不好说了。岛上到底是否需要闪闪发亮的石头呢？人们的争论丝毫不能降低那些因为这项计划得到工作的人对该计划的推崇程度。\n与此同时，新政府渔业部成立并开始运营。渔业部提供很高的工资和良好的福利，很容易就雇到了员工。被雇用的人很喜欢这份稳定的工作，很高兴地把选票投给了他们的参议员赞助人。\n但是，在光鲜的外表下面，真正的问题在不知不觉中形成了。\n由于渔业部的员工不会出于个人利益去冒险或获取利润，所以他们的效率很低下。\n岛上捕获的真鱼的增长率远远低于参议院发行的鱼邦储备券的增长率。\n很快，鱼邦储备券发行量过大，技师们不得不降低转换率。10∶9变成了5∶4。也就是说，官鱼比真鱼要小20%。\n后来这个比率也无法维持平衡，转换率又降到3∶2，最后降到了2∶1。\n官鱼越来越小，不久后岛民每天只吃一条鱼已经无法填饱肚子了，大多数人每天至少要吃两条鱼。\n因为官鱼是岛上的货币，所以物价都必须相应上涨才能弥补鱼损失的营养价值。于是通鱼膨胀的难题产生了。尽管通常来说生产率提高会促使物价下跌，现在政府引起的通鱼膨胀却导致物价上涨。\n奇怪的是，物价上涨的原因究竟是什么，人们莫衷一是。人们需要一个合理的解释，因此阿里·格林芬提出了一个理论。他解释说：“通鱼膨胀是由一种叫作‘鱼成本推动’的现象引起的。”他说高就业率（部分归功于政府提供的就业岗位）和繁荣的经济一起促使对鱼的需求增加，推动了物价上涨。\n格林芬指出，现在大多数岛民每天吃的鱼是前辈们的两倍，这就是经济繁荣的明证。\n格林芬还提醒说，如果没有稳定的通鱼膨胀提供刺激，人们就会失去食欲，对鱼的需求消失，那么岛上的经济就会收缩。他进一步指出，每年贬值一半的通鱼膨胀水平是最理想的。他说，通鱼膨胀是经济发展的重要环节。\n“说得好，阿里。你都能把死人说活啦。”弗兰基说。没有人想到应该指责政府——这个引发通鱼膨胀的真凶。\n有了这种可以任意填写数字的空白支票，政府会继续发行更多的钞票取悦民众。这样一来，官鱼的尺寸越来越小，越来越不值钱。因此，工资和物价都要上涨。有些年份，由于生产率提高的抵消作用，人们几乎注意不到通鱼膨胀，但是有两件事是雷打不动的：官鱼从未变大，物价从未下降！\n随着通鱼膨胀愈演愈烈，岛民们终于注意到他们从银行取出的鱼比他们存入银行的鱼要小。因此，虽然有利息的诱惑，人们还是开始减少储蓄，有些人索性一点儿也不储蓄了。反过来，由于物价不断快速上涨，人们必须抓紧消费，以免损失鱼的价值。\n快速的通鱼膨胀的最大受害者是退休人员。在参加工作的那些年里他们把鱼存入银行，而现在他们每天必须吃两三条鱼才能果腹。他们原以为可以让他们维持生活20年的储蓄，四五年就用光了。\n通鱼膨胀抑制储蓄，银行储蓄额随之降低了。结果，可以用来投资有前景的项目或者支持不景气的企业的存鱼减少了。相应地，企业开始削减成本，很多工人因此失业。很多岛民迫切希望抵消通鱼膨胀的影响，于是他们决定冒险把存款交给曼尼打理，因为曼尼承诺的回报率很高，这是投资者弥补损失的最大希望。\n后来失业率达到了危险的水平，人们要求政府采取措施。\n于是，参议院严格规定了企业应该向工人支付的最低报酬，在什么情况下可以雇用和解雇工人，以及产品价格应该怎么制定。有了这些限制，企业做生意更加困难，发展能力也受到限制。\n后来，一位新参议员林迪·B发现了一个竞选的良机——这一次要建立一个大社会！林迪承诺，如果他当选，他不仅会为海军装备更大的长矛，还会向所有失业工人提供紧急失业救济鱼券，以缓解不景气的经济状况。\n他的竞争对手巴蒂·金余仅仅做出要好好管理岛上储蓄的承诺，以及不干涉公民经济自由的老生常谈。更重要的是，巴蒂指出岛国负担不起昂贵的“长矛和鱼”的政策。\n毫无悬念，林迪获得了压倒性胜利。\n这个过程依旧在持续。鱼邦储备券的发行量越来越大，而捕鱼船队带回来的真鱼却越来越少。\n当官鱼的尺寸变成只有原来的1/10时，即便是阿里·格林芬也明白他无法再弄虚作假了。当储藏室里只剩下鱼骨时，他跑到参议院召开了紧急会议。\n现实链接\n经济学家们非常成功地混淆了通货膨胀的起因，手段之一就是简化这个词的定义。几乎所有人都认为物价上涨就是通货膨胀。因此，如果物价没有上涨，就没有通货膨胀。\n但是上涨的价格不过是通货膨胀的结果罢了！这就好比给气球充气，气球就会不断膨大一样。通货膨胀其实就是货币供应量增加，与其相反的情况即为通货紧缩，意指货币供应收紧。从另一方面来说，价格自身其实不会膨胀或者紧缩，只会上涨或下跌。所以膨胀的不是价格，而是货币供应。\n凡是1990年以前出版的字典对通货膨胀的定义都是货币供应量的增加。较新版本的字典的定义就开始松动了。不过，如果你明白通货膨胀的真正含义，你就会明白，就算货币供应量增加，物价也可以保持平稳甚至下降。\n经济不景气时，人们会理智地选择停止消费。一旦这样，需求就会降低，物价就会回落。不过有时增加货币供应量能够抵消这些因素，因为增加货币供应量会降低货币的价值。如果通货膨胀发生在经济不景气的时期，物价会上涨（前提是货币发行的速度足够快）、保持平稳或者比正常情况下跌得慢一些。\n但是，经济不景气时，物价需要下跌才能平衡经济局势。经济不景气时需要通货紧缩，物价下跌能够削弱低就业率的影响。然而，当代经济学家却认为，物价下跌会导致经济陷入需求崩溃的万丈深渊。他们忘记了一旦物价下跌到一定程度，人们就会开始消费。这个过程淘汰了不必要的产能，把物价调低到符合内在供求关系的水平。\n通货膨胀人为地使物价居高不下，妨碍了上述过程发挥作用。\n目前，许多政府应对经济衰退的本能反应便是造更多的货币。但是如果货币投入过多，这种手段就会同时带来通货膨胀和经济衰退两大问题，导致“经济停滞型通货膨胀”的出现。20世纪70年代，这种现象最为突出。然而，现今的许多经济学家却一股脑儿地将20世纪那段插曲抛到九霄云外，坚持认为通货膨胀和失业问题根本不可能同时存在。他们认为，人们失业时，需求便会下降，价格也会随之下降，可他们却忽略了等式的另一边：一旦工作的人数量减少了，生产的产品也会减少，供应量便会减少。而物质匮乏会导致价格上涨。如果人们向这种并不明朗的经济状况中投入更多货币，必然会导致价格飞涨。第十一章\n中岛帝国：远方的生命线\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n参议院会议上，格林芬说，我已经无能为力了，银行里完全没有存鱼了。一些参议员建议把真相告诉民众，但是遭到了否决。林迪想找个万全之策。\n他让岛上最聪明的经济学家本·伯南柯接管鱼邦储备银行。\n“没问题，阁下。”伯南柯说，“现在的情况是民众失去了信心。如果我们现在开始消费更多的鱼邦储备券，人们的信心就会恢复，民众就会重新开始消费。如果有必要，我会坐在棕榈树上往下撒钱。”\n一些参议员有点儿发懵。虽然他们没有受过伯南柯那样的经济学教育，但还是有人隐隐感觉到所有的问题最初都是由消费过剩引起的。巴蒂·金余据理力争，但是没人理他。\n所幸，由于出现了意想不到的转机，参议员们不需要再做这些痛苦的抉择。参议院的大门突然被推开了，岛上一位远渡重洋的大使和几个长相奇特的人闯了进来。\n这位大使在东部海域发现了一个名叫“中岛帝国”的岛国。在那里，所有的居民依然在徒手捕鱼。中岛帝国的经济缺乏自由，因而发展缓慢。\n在中岛帝国，所有人都必须捕鱼，然而捕获的鱼却不归个人所有。所有的鱼都要上交给国家，由国家决定谁应该得到多少。\n中岛帝国的国王如果注意到他的渔民没有竭尽全力，就会要求他们在打鱼的同时一起唱爱国歌曲。如果有人忘词了或者走调了，不予以纠正就没有饭吃。\n在这种制度之下，虽然人均捕鱼量不高，但是当权者却能得到其中的很大一部分。所以，中岛帝国的一般民众每天只能吃到半条鱼，而国王和官员们却每天都能吃到美味海鲜。\n中岛帝国的情况跟美索尼亚国出现第一份资本前的情况很像，那时没有储蓄，没有银行，没有信贷，更没有企业。在美索尼亚人看来，中岛帝国的经济还处于黑暗时代（中世纪水平）。\n值得赞扬的是，中岛帝国的国王很明智，他明白这样下去自己国家的经济不会得到快速的发展。得知美索尼亚国经济发展的经过之后，国王对该岛国先进的银行、借贷和贸易系统以及人们奢侈的生活方式印象深刻，他决心让自己的岛屿也变得繁荣起来。\n国王研究了岛际贸易的运行方式，他推测拥有鱼邦储备券是打开发展之门的钥匙。\n他注意到这种钞票可以在整个海域作为货币流通，可以用来购买小鼓岛的小鼓，也可以换取狂舞岛上的椰子防晒油。\n中岛帝国的大使意识到拥有这种钞票就可以融入岛际贸易，于是他提出要用鱼交换鱼邦储备券。\n参议员们看着中岛帝国的来者，感到难以置信。他们面面相觑，无比惊奇。有这么简单吗？用一堆纸就能换来鲜鱼？\n林迪毫不犹豫地走上前去，答应了他们的条件，表示美索尼亚国会慷慨地向中岛帝国敞开市场的大门，那什么时候能把船上的鱼卸下来呢？\n不过，在签署协议之前，中岛帝国大使要求美索尼亚国保证其货币会一直具有实际价值。\n“放心吧！”林迪说，“不论什么时候你们想用钞票来兑换鲜鱼，只需要到我们银行的窗口来，我们很乐意提供你们所需要的一切。你可以四处看看，我们像缺鱼的样子吗？”\n于是，双方签订了合约，中岛帝国的鱼也送到了。林迪拿出几堆新印刷的钞票作为交换。他强忍着笑，说了两句临别赠言：“收好了，伙计们。这东西可是很难得的。”\n他转过头对首席银行家说：“嘿，伯南柯，赶在营业之前把鱼送到银行去。”\n伯南柯如释重负，他心领神会，说道：“没问题，阁下。我已经安排好一队技师在储藏库里待命了。鱼一送到，他们就会开工。储户们今天就能拿到鱼。另外，不同于昨天，今天的鱼骨头上会有不少肉的！”\n从此，美索尼亚国经济史掀开了新的一页。每天都有一艘中岛帝国的货船运鱼来，作为回报，他们每天都能得到一堆新钞票。\n中岛帝国面临的主要问题是怎么处理这些钞票。最好的办法是用它们购买美索尼亚国的产品。当然，中岛帝国需要渔网提高捕鱼效率，而美索尼亚国的工厂织的网是最好的。因此，艾伯渔网公司接到了一笔很大的订单。\n该买的东西都买了之后，中岛帝国还剩下一些钞票。由于他们国内没有银行系统，他们决定将贸易顺差存入鱼邦储备银行，这样至少还能赚些利息。\n这些交易大大促进了美索尼亚国的发展。一方面，国外需求推动了当地经济；另一方面，中岛帝国存入银行的鱼也使可用的贷款大幅增加。尽管美索尼亚人消费比储蓄多，银行依然有足够的鱼可以拿出来以很低的利率提供贷款。\n有了大批的真鱼，官鱼骨头上的肉多了起来，美索尼亚国的通鱼膨胀问题基本消失了。因为官鱼变得比以前大，物价停止了上涨，人们的生活水平也再度提高。\n中岛帝国也是日新月异。\n后知后觉的国王终于意识到了国内经济模式的致命缺点。如果岛民们必须上交所有的鱼，他们永远不会卖力干活。国王想通了这一点，他从美索尼亚国购买了渔网，然后进行了翻天覆地的政策改革。凡是从国王这里购买渔网的人，都可以把多出来的鱼留归己有。毫无疑问，岛上的捕鱼活动活跃起来。\n中岛帝国的岛民们非常明智地用他们积攒的储蓄购买了资本设备，扩大了生产。但是中岛帝国的企业家依照国家的要求，生产那些可以兑换成鱼邦储备券的产品。因为美索尼亚国掌握着所有的鱼邦储备券，所以中岛帝国的工厂集中生产美索尼亚国人想要的东西。\n有了多劳多得的激励制度以后，中岛帝国很快就积累了不少储蓄，并扩大了生产。结果，中岛帝国的企业家们现在也有能力兴建工厂制造产品了，比如勺子和碗。尽管大多数中岛帝国人自己还缺少这些东西，但他们却把这些货物卖给美索尼亚人。你也许猜到了，这样做是为了赚取更多的鱼邦储备券。\n现实链接\n多年来，经济学家对美中关系的理解一直是错误的。大多数人认为那是一种互利互惠的双边关系：美国得到廉价商品和贷款，中国得到制造业的就业机会。然而，这真的是一种双赢的安排吗？\n美国人占了便宜：他们不用生产就可以得到商品，不必储蓄就可以得到贷款。而对于中国人来说，他们辛勤工作却不能消费自己生产的产品，他们努力储蓄却得不到贷款。\n这有什么好处呢？美国的低利率很大程度上是由国外的高储蓄率造成的，大多数当代经济学权威都没有意识到这一点。要记住，想要借贷，就必须先储蓄。所幸，对于美国来说，全球经济使得借与存的关系可以不受国境的限制。\n到目前为止，美国手中的王牌一直是美元的地位。作为世界的官方储备货币，美元是一切国际贸易的结算货币。也就是说，不仅仅是美国的贸易伙伴，所有人交易时都需要使用美元。所以，即便没有人购买美国的产品，人们也需要美元。而其他任何国家都没有这种运气。\n外国人持有的美元很多都存在美国的银行里，因而又可以借贷给美国人。这么一来，美国人即使不储蓄也可以获得贷款。\n人民币和美元紧密挂钩，这就要求中国公民至少要将储蓄的一部分兑换成美元。\n如果没有中国和其他国家的储蓄，美国人以及美国政府想要借钱就会很困难，他们将不得不承担高额的贷款利率。对于靠贷款推动的美国经济而言，利率偏高和信贷吃紧是一个致命的组合。\n目前美国领导人和中国的冲突不断升级，在他们决定与中国划清界限之前，需要好好认清这条生命线。当然，既然这种关系不可能永远持续下去，结束得越早，痛苦就越小，对美国人来说尤其如此。白食吃得越久，有朝一日没得吃时，就越是难以自食其力。第十二章\n服务业是如何崛起的\nHOW

CRASHES\n中岛帝国的储蓄大量涌入，贷款利率随之降低，这使美索尼亚国企业家们的投资热情高涨。但是，由于捕鱼和制造业的工作越来越多地外包给中岛帝国，他们提出来的商业计划和以往大相径庭。现在，大多数商业计划更青睐那些需要本地员工提供服务的项目。这类工作无法外包，而且需要的资本较少。\n在美索尼亚国第一次经济会议上，本·伯南柯为解释这些变化发表了一次著名的演讲。他认为美索尼亚国的经济已经发展到了一定程度，捕鱼和制造业这类低级劳动应该外包给穷国，而美索尼亚人则可以自由地从事更加复杂的服务业的工作，比如厨师、演讲家和艺术家。\n查理创立的老字号查理冲浪公司就是其中的一个例子。\n这家公司的几代传人一直制造冲浪板，并且非常成功，现在公司正在朝新的方向发展。查理的后人借了一大笔贷款，扩展了业务，建起了冲浪学校。12座崭新的校园遍布全岛。\n与此同时，公司还达成了一项在中岛帝国生产冲浪板的协议，向外国工人支付鱼邦储备券，但是高附加值的冲浪板设计和冲浪技巧培训业务还保留在国内。\n不久，服务业蓬勃发展起来。以前遍布全岛的制造工厂如今都被主要经销进口货物的零售公司取代了。\n参议院为了取悦选民，制定了名目繁多的条例、收费和税收项目，这些都加速了外包的趋势。这些障碍使得美索尼亚国的企业在新的岛际竞争中举步维艰。\n与此同时，在海的那一边，中岛帝国也在经历着变革……\n不出所料，中岛帝国引入了渔网技术，加上个人利益的神奇力量，导致捕鱼效率大大提高。最终，中岛帝国攒够了钱，建造了很多巨型捕鱼器（捕鱼器的设计者起诉他们侵犯知识产权，但是在中岛帝国完全没有胜诉的可能）。他们实行24小时工作制，三班轮岗，不间断捕鱼。大部分鱼都出口到了美索尼亚国。\n由于捕鱼的生产效率提高，工人们可以腾出时间从事其他工作，主要是与制造业相关的工作。\n一船接一船的鱼和货物漂洋过海运往美索尼亚国，同时，鱼邦储备券如潮水般流向中岛帝国。\n在正常的贸易关系中（比如小鼓岛和狂舞岛之间的贸易），中岛帝国的产品应该用来交换所需要的美索尼亚国的产品，但是中岛帝国积攒钞票的意愿导致了两者间完全不同的关系，即一座岛主要负责生产，另一座岛主要负责消费。\n中岛帝国的国王为什么能够容忍这样的安排呢？很多人都想不明白。但是，与他以前的一些计划相比，这一政策显得合乎逻辑。这项政策使得国王稳坐江山，但是中岛帝国制造冲浪板的工人却没有得到什么实际的好处，他们整日忙于工作，自己连冲浪的时间都没有。\n当然，中岛帝国人相信他们最后总会得到回报，到时他们就可以不用捕鱼，靠储蓄就能安然度日了。然而，中岛帝国人却没有意识到，美索尼亚国连养活自己百姓的能力都没有，怎么可能为他们兑换钞票呢？\n在美索尼亚国的另一次经济会议上，本·伯南柯声称，双方的这种关系堪称最新也是最有效的经济分工的典范。\n他解释说，美索尼亚国在消费方面有一定的优势，这对整个海域都是有利的。他指出，其他任何岛屿的居民都没有这么强劲的购买力，美索尼亚人的消费能力是最可靠的。美索尼亚国拥有宽阔的道路、豪华的汽车和奢华的豪宅，所有的一切都使他们成为最有消费能力的消费者！\n美索尼亚人乐观进取，即便身无分文也敢花钱。因此，其他岛屿可以更有效地把消费外包给美索尼亚国！\n另外，伯南柯也解释说，中岛帝国最善于储蓄和制造商品。因此，他指出：“将制造业外包给中岛帝国，效率更高。”\n故事引申\n与大多数同时代的经济学家一样，伯南柯认为消费是经济发展的内在动力。因此，最大的消费群体就是经济增长的引擎。\n尽情购物要比卖力工作更让人快乐。这一点连傻瓜都知道。但是，是卖力工作的人，而不是尽情购物的人，第一时间将商品放在货架上。没有产品，购买就无从谈起。一旦某个产品被生产出来，它将必然被用于销售。可能发生变化的仅仅是其购买者和价格。\n现实链接\n过去10年里，全球经济失衡是大多数重量级经济会议上常常讨论的问题。虽然人们为此发表了无数的演讲，写过长篇累牍的报道，这个问题却丝毫没有得到解决。\n全球经济失衡最明显的证据就是美国的贸易逆差。在美国历史上的多数时期，出口都大于进口，造成贸易顺差。在有些年份，尤其是接近20世纪中叶的时候，贸易顺差额还相当巨大。美国利用这些盈余在国内置办了更多资产，在国外也购买了不少资产。在这个过程中，美国成了世界上最富有的国家。但是到20世纪60年代末，贸易平衡被打破了。自1976年以来，美国开始常年处于贸易逆差状态。\n美元的储备货币地位很大程度上导致了贸易逆差的扩大。如果没有全球经济系统对美元的内在需求，任何国家都无法长期维持这种失衡状态。各家公司和各国政府都会拒绝用商品交换无法购买任何东西的货币。\n在20世纪70\\~80年代，美国的贸易逆差为100亿\\~500亿美元，虽然数额巨大，但仍在掌控中。到了20世纪90年代，贸易逆差冲破1 000亿美元关口。虽然数额大得惊人，但与美国巨大的经济总量相比，这个缺口相对不大。不过，一进入21世纪，情况就变得严重了。\n21世纪的前10年是中国作为出口型经济大国崛起的10年。在这10年里，美国的贸易逆差平均每年都达到6 000亿美元，2006年更是达到了令人咋舌的7 630亿美元。这就意味着，每个美国人，不论男女老少，都要分摊2 500美元。\n幸好，2008年经济衰退开始后，美国的贸易逆差有所减少。但是，正如我们亲眼所见的那样，美国的政策很快终结了这种积极的趋势。\n正常来讲，贸易逆差能够自我调节。\n如果一个国家处于贸易顺差状态，也就是说其出口额大于进口额，就会在国际上形成对其货币的需求。如果你想要该国的产品，你就需要该国的货币。所以，强势的贸易地位会使一国货币坚挺，弱势的贸易地位会导致该国货币疲软。如果没有人想购买你的产品，也就没有人需要你的货币。\n但是，一旦一国的货币升值，该国的产品也会相应涨价。这就给处于弱势贸易地位的国家提供了进入该国市场的机会。他们的商品销售得越多，国际市场对其货币的需求就越大。这股货币平衡力量会使脱缰野马般的贸易失衡得到控制。\n然而，美元的储备货币地位以及中国政府保持人民币与美元挂钩的决定破坏了这一机制，使局势越发不可收拾。\n近些年来，为了给其出口企业提供一种理论上的优势，多国政府广泛开展多项活动抑制其货币，这些活动引发了人们所说的“全球货币战争”。这是一种非常让人摸不着头脑的对抗，因为对抗的目的通常不是除掉对手，而是干掉自己。\n诚然，一个国家可以通过行之有效的销售渠道卖掉更多的产品，但在这个过程中可能会损失部分利润。另外，廉价货币同时也会提高进口成本，因为出口不过是补偿进口的一种方式。一个国家有意弱化本国货币，以此让人们更加努力地工作，来补偿进口商品。这便意味着人们的生活水平会下降。第十三章\n“鱼本位”的破灭\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n鱼邦储备券继续如潮水般流出美索尼亚国，在大洋中的其他岛屿上堆积成山。终于，一些外国持有者开始质疑这些储备券能否兑换成真鱼。\n小鼓岛的领袖查克·小鼓很有个人魅力，他通过嘲笑美索尼亚国的傲慢与力量在国内广受支持。他认为接受鱼邦储备券只是加强了美索尼亚国的经济实力，于是他开始派遣一批又一批的金融特使去银行窗口兑换真鱼。\n频繁兑换真鱼开始对存鱼造成冲击，技师们又忙碌了起来。他们不断地切割、重组，官鱼越变越小，通鱼膨胀又有抬头之势。\n美索尼亚国的经济再度恶化。\n新当选的议长靠布柱·迪克森从他的经济顾问那里得知，如果其他岛屿都效仿小鼓岛，整个海域范围的兑现风潮就会清空鱼邦储备银行的储藏室，而鱼邦储备券就会变得一文不值。\n伯南柯和参议员们开始发愁了。\n靠布柱不敢让他的人民吃苦还债，所以他决定让外国人承担损失。他对外国储蓄者关闭了银行兑换窗口！从那时起，鱼邦储备券的价值不再取决于它能够兑换成真鱼，它在国际市场上的价值将只由对方想交换的商品价值决定。实际上，只有美索尼亚国保有经济和军事大国的地位，鱼邦储备券才具有价值。\n“鱼本位”的破灭导致很多岛屿对鱼邦储备券失去了信心。毫不奇怪，鱼邦储备券的价值暴跌。然而，由于鱼邦储备券仍然是最常见的货币形式，价格最终稳定下来。对于美索尼亚国参议院而言，关闭银行兑换窗口使得他们安然度过危机，避免了丢掉政权之祸（这其实是参议员们唯一担心的问题）。靠布柱长舒了一口气。\n查克·小鼓勃然大怒，发表了很多颇具威胁性的演讲。但是他的努力大多是象征性的，美索尼亚国的地位不可撼动。\n不幸的是，靠布柱因为随后发生的“水蛇事件”下了台。人们发现他藏有一储藏室偷来的爬行动物。\n货币危机过去之后，通鱼膨胀基本上消失了。另外，虽然银行关闭了兑换窗口，鱼邦储备券的地位并没有动摇。美索尼亚国的经济稳定了下来。几年以后，罗非·里实当选议长，进一步推动美索尼亚国走向繁荣富强。\n里实成功地降低了税收，放松了管制，还减少了与其他岛屿进行自由贸易的壁垒。然而，他减少政府支出的承诺并没有兑现。虽然里实营造了良好的经济氛围，但是参议院的收支差距还在持续扩大。实际上，在里实的统治下，这个缺口越来越大，经济危如累卵。\n好在国外的鲜鱼源源不断地涌入银行。用来买鱼的钞票流通到了国外，永远不会再兑换成真鱼。有了这么一个聚宝盆，美索尼亚国进入了表面上看来前所未有的繁荣时期。\n现实链接\n在有文字记载的历史上，人类曾把各种物品当作货币。食盐、贝壳、珠子和牲畜都曾流通一时，但是，最后金属（尤其是金银）成了最普遍的货币形式。这绝非偶然。贵重金属拥有货币的所有价值属性和使用属性：储量稀少、人人想要、质地均匀、性质稳定、延展性好。\n即便人们不想用贵金属充当货币，贵金属依然因为有其他用途和储量稀少的特性而具有价值。\n相反，纸币只有在足够多的人愿意使用纸币交换产品和服务时才有价值。因此，纸币的价值完全由人主观决定。由于纸币可以无限量地发行，并且没有内在价值，如果人们对纸币失去信心，它们就会变成一堆废纸。\n虽然经济学家声称已经预见到了这一切，但事实上，从长期来看，我们并没有预见全球经济会建立在一种不可兑现的货币（通常称之为“法定货币”）的基础上。“法定”（fiat）一词来自拉丁语，字面含义为“让它做”（Let it be done）。我们用这个词是想表达纸币本身没有内在价值，是因为政府的命令而具有价值。\n历史上不乏失败的例子：某些政府陷入财政困境，走投无路，于是把发行毫无价值的纸币的做法当作救命稻草。这些做法最终往往惨淡收场，国民损失尤其惨重。\n这是因为，如果某个国家的邻国仍旧发行真实货币，而这个国家却想持续发行毫无价值的纸币，那是行不通的。外国人自然会拒绝接受毫无价值的纸币，最终国内就会出现买卖真实货币的黑市。\n但是现在我们处于一个“镜中世界”，在过去的40年中，没有任何国家发行过真实货币。这是有史以来最大的货币实验。没人知道这个实验何时结束，结果又如何。但是可以肯定的是，这个实验总会有结束的一天。第十四章\n棚屋价格是如何涨上去的\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n尽管查理冲浪公司成功地转入服务业，但银行在给此类高风险的服务业提供资金时还是谨小慎微。银行想寻找一个稳妥的项目，最后它们盯上了岛上沉睡着的棚屋贷款市场，认为那是低风险贷款的理想对象。\n在此之前，在岛上的全面经济图景中，棚屋市场从未获得过显著的地位。棚屋很适合岛民的生活方式，最初是很朴素的。但是由于经济繁荣，利率降低，人们开始需要更新、更大、更美观的棚屋。\n以前，岛民需要储蓄很多年，然后一次性拿出大量的鱼来买一间棚屋。后来，银行开始向岛上信誉较好的人提供棚屋贷款。有了贷款，即使借款人目前的储蓄额低于棚屋的价格也没有关系，他们不必再等，可以直接入住。\n虽然棚屋贷款不能提高岛上的生产能力和借款人的还款能力（商业贷款则可以），但是这些贷款安全性很高。与那些借给前途未卜的企业家的商业贷款不同，棚屋贷款有天然的抵押物，也就是所购买的棚屋。如果借款人不能还款，银行还可以没收棚屋，把它卖掉，以偿还贷款。\n即便如此，银行也不能保证收回全部贷款。因此，为了抵消这个风险，银行要求借款人先交大量的鱼作为首付。有了首付，银行就获得了一定的信心，相信借款人会继续还款。如果借款人不能归还所有贷款，这种做法也能减少银行的损失。\n有些岛民愤愤不平，因为并不是所有人都有机会获得棚屋贷款。富人一般很容易得到贷款，而没有储蓄或者信用记录较差的人就没那么幸运了。有人觉得穷人被剥夺了使用岛上财富的权利。参议员认为这是潜在的竞选议题，于是插手进来，想要解决这个问题。\n参议员克里夫·考得认为拥有棚屋是美索尼亚梦的核心，因此他制订了一个计划，让政府帮助每个人得到棚屋贷款。\n为推动这一进程，考得创立了两个半官方机构——棚利美和棚地美——为棚屋贷款做担保，同时也会收购银行不愿意持有的贷款。尽管“两棚”（棚利美和棚地美）并没有明确的官方担保，可这座小岛上的每个人都相信参议院不会令他们失望。心中怀着这一信念，诸位放款人便不再担心符合“两棚”标准的棚屋贷款损失了。\n于是，那些贷款的利率和放贷标准急剧降低。银行将贷款提供给“两棚”，很快就能收回本金，这样它就能放出更多贷款！\n棚屋贷款项目犹如给银行打了一针强心剂，现在它可以几乎毫无风险地赚钱。同时，这个项目也很受选民欢迎，他们不必辛苦积攒半生才能买下一间棚屋。由于考得在整个事件中表现出来的精明能干，他后半生一直稳坐参议员的位置。\n学利美是政府设置的另一个机构，旨在为想进入冲浪学校学习的年轻人提供贷款。政府担保的助学贷款吸引了越来越多的岛民到学校学习如何提高冲浪技术。\n因为人们很容易就能得到学利美的贷款，查理冲浪公司不必担心高学费会吓跑消费者，所以大幅提高了学费。不久，学费的增长幅度就远远超过了总体的通鱼膨胀率。大多数经济学家都认为，更高的价格是冲浪学位社会价值提升的表现。\n为了跟上学费增长的步伐，学利美持续提高助学贷款的额度。几年以后，冲浪学校的助学贷款就成了岛民一生中极大的花销之一。\n同样，在“两棚”的作用下，岛上的棚屋建造、棚屋销售和棚屋装修业务也轰轰烈烈地发展起来。这些活动吸收了越来越多的产能，却没有换来更多的真鱼，也没有提高任何人偿还棚屋贷款的能力。\n故事引申\n虽然这些贷款政策看起来好像是参与各方共同受益，但实际上整个系统制造了更大的风险。\n参议院推行的刺激政策向棚屋贷款和助学贷款倾斜，其他没有政府担保的贷款受到影响，扰乱了信贷市场。参议院鼓励放贷并不是因为那是使用储蓄的最佳方式，而是因为帮助人们获得棚屋和教育机会能够转化为政治资本。\n因为有“两棚”的担保，棚屋贷款利率下调，岛民就能获得更大额的贷款。结果，就像冲浪学校的学费一样，棚屋价格也开始明显上扬。随着棚屋价格的不断上涨，在岛民看来，购买棚屋不仅仅是一笔可以承担的费用，还是一项重要的投资。人们认为购买棚屋比储蓄更划算，更能为以后的幸福生活提供保障。\n参议院还宣布棚屋买卖产生的大部分利润都享受免税优惠，而且棚屋贷款的利息还可以从每年的鱼税中扣除，这就进一步刺激了棚屋行业。结果，买卖棚屋成了比创业和储蓄更有利可图的事。于是，岛上有了更多的新棚屋。与此同时岛上的储蓄和新企业不断减少。\n后来棚屋价格飙升，贷款总额达到了参议院为“两棚”设置的上限。这时，议长考得不可避免地介入，他宣称“两棚”的基本状况良好，要求参议院提高贷款上限，降低首付款，降低信用标准，以确保人们买得起棚屋。他真是个常胜将军。\n“两棚”的老板都是考得的老朋友，为了答谢考得的帮助，他们为他的连任选举做出了很大的贡献，还给考得的棚屋提供了友情贷款。\n由于“两棚”向投资者提供的回报率大于鱼邦储备银行的利率，中岛帝国人就把他们贸易顺差的一部分投到了“两棚”中。有参议院为“两棚”的偿付能力做担保，中岛帝国人对这两个借贷机构很有信心。\n中岛帝国的投资流入棚屋贷款市场，大大增加了信贷供给量，进一步压低了贷款利率。也就是说，更多的人可以得到大额贷款。因为能够轻而易举地获得大额贷款，购买棚屋者把谨慎抛到脑后，棚屋价格进一步升高了。\n看到了潜在的利润，曼尼七世也大举进入棚屋信贷市场。作为岛上第一位风险投资人的后代，他注意到有一些贷款风险极高，即便是“两棚”也不愿意涉及。但是考虑到当前的棚屋投资狂潮，他相信自己可以凭借曼尼的威望说服买家，让他们相信这些贷款是可靠的。\n曼尼开始为岛民提供一项叫作“棚屋置换”的新贷款业务，允许棚屋所有者用更大数额的贷款替代棚屋原有的按揭贷款。新的贷款不仅能够偿还原来的贷款，剩下的钱还可以装进借款人的腰包。棚屋价格的上升也证明大额贷款是有市场的。有了曼尼的“以小换大”贷款，任何拥有棚屋的人都可以得到几乎免费的鱼。\n由于曼尼向借款人收取较高的利率，因此他给投资者的回报率也很高。“两棚”见状也想分一杯羹，它们希望考得允许它们购买这些风险更高、收益也更高的贷款。成交之后，“两棚”就成了棚屋置换贷款市场中最大的贷款人。\n住宅净值融资无疑为棚屋装修产业打了一针强心剂，使这一产业成了经济活动的一个主要中心。棚得宝是一家全岛范围的连锁店，主要进口棚屋装修材料，并雇用多位专家向大家展示怎样通过棚屋装修赚更多的钱。一个广为流传的说法是，在装修上投入一条鱼，卖出棚屋时就能赚两条鱼。没有人确切知道这是为什么，但是专业人士怎么会错呢？\n棚屋变得比以前奢华得多。火炉上镶嵌着打磨过的鲍鱼壳，悬挂水桶用的是高档的丝线绳。不少棚屋铺的都是名牌茅草，室内都装有内置的宽大的玻璃窗。\n很快，基本的居住用棚屋已经不能满足岛民的需求，他们开始修建度假用的棚屋，并把修建棚屋作为一种投资。一些岛民甚至直接在普通棚屋上面加盖度假用棚屋。\n可是后来发生了一件怪事：棚屋价格开始飙升。其中的原因一方面是存在“以小换大”贷款、低首付（或零首付）和棚屋利润免税的政策，另一方面则是银行在“两棚”的担保下大量放贷的结果。以前棚屋价格通常一年上涨几个百分点，而现在一个月就上涨那么多！再差的棚屋也有人抢着要。\n局势发展得超乎想象，传统的支付能力标准不再适用。以前岛民只会用年收入的两三倍买棚屋，现在他们要花掉年收入的一二十倍。人们明知负担不起还要买棚屋，是因为他们相信买入的棚屋几年后可以卖个好价钱。有这么好的增值前景，又没有什么风险，加上政府的一系列鼓励政策（包括人为造就的低贷款利率），没有人能抗拒这种诱惑。\n然而，快速飙升的棚屋价格给参议员们带来了实惠。轻而易举获得的财富让选民们感觉自己很富有，也间接证明了参议员们的英明。参议员们自然不遗余力地维持棚屋市场的繁荣增长。本·伯南柯和阿里·格林芬向所有人保证不会出现棚屋供大于求的局面，因为棚屋价格绝不会下跌。\n大肆吹捧棚屋市场的人不仅仅是政治家，岛上最受尊敬的私营部门思想家吹嘘得最起劲。在衣冠楚楚的巴里·雪余子主持的脱口秀节目中，岛民们经常讨论时事。一向乐观的巴里戏称这一时期为“金鱼经济”。卡普·盖佛等专栏作家也告诉岛民们，棚屋市场崩溃是天方夜谭，现在的银行优惠政策是前所未有的。客串嘉宾派克·希夫一向笑料百出，他警告人们棚屋市场崩溃即将来临，引起了阵阵哄堂大笑。\n现实链接\n现在，惨痛的事实告诉我们每个人，美国在房市泡沫膨胀和破灭的过程中体会到了喜悦和痛苦。因此，我们必须铭记危机曾经近在咫尺，而绝大部分经济学家、政府官员和金融评论家都没能预见到灾难的来临。\n这就好像一场5级飓风已经距离迈阿密海岸仅十几公里了，气象学家却没有预报一样。主流的经济学家有多么愚蠢，似乎不需要更多的证据来证明了吧？\n任何头脑清醒的人都能看出，2006年的房价已经高得离谱了。人们对房价的估计与对自身负担能力的估计脱节了。所有的数字都不对劲。然而，经济学家却想出了一些莫名其妙的理论，似乎能解释房价上涨的原因。\n但是，人们没有看透这些吵吵闹闹背后的真正目的。政治家想要用虚假的繁荣维持选民高涨的自信心，企业想让消费者花钱购买他们负担不起的产品和服务，有线新闻网想通过描绘太平盛世赢得高收视率，银行、按揭贷款发放机构以及房地产经纪人想继续赚取费用和利息。这些利益集团雇用了大批的人粉饰这个最大最丑陋的骗局。而且，令人吃惊的是，人们真的接受了他们的解释。\n那么，我们现在终于学会实际一些了，对吗？大错特错。即便在按揭贷款市场崩盘以后，人们仍然不明白政府政策是如何影响房价的。小布什和奥巴马政府斥巨资扶持下跌的房地产市场。这意味着政府和美联储对房地产市场的投入比危机发生前投入得更多。但是人们依然没有认识到，这些措施是如何支撑房地产市场的价格，并让我们以后摔得更惨的。第十五章\n快了！快了！棚屋市场要崩溃了\nHOW

CRASHES\n谁也说不清棚屋市场到底是什么时候开始逆转的。也许是因为备受关注的火山全景单元房项目的失败。那个项目的设施齐全、空间宽敞，还有无与伦比的海景和火山景观，但是不知为什么没人愿意购买。\n曼尼是这个项目的主要担保人，项目失败后，开发商无法偿还工程贷款，曼尼受到了很大的打击。紧张的棚屋投资者看到火山全景单元房项目的损失后，开始仔细审视其他高风险的棚屋项目。一种明显的恐慌情绪蔓延开来。\n很快，大小投资者都认为棚屋市场已经达到顶峰。不少人决定出售棚屋，赚取差价，等到更好的时机再投资。\n但是有一个问题——所有人都同时想到了这一点。大多数棚屋所有者从一开始就没打算长期持有棚屋，所以棚屋市场刚一生变，所有人都想立即脱手。很快，岛上全是出售棚屋的人，却没人购买棚屋。这样一来，意想不到的结果出现了：棚屋价格不是逐渐下跌，而是直线下降。棚屋供大于求的现象很快演变为棚屋价格的大规模下跌。\n想当年，只要拥有棚屋就可以轻而易举地赚钱，而如今卖棚屋却变成了赔本的买卖。由于棚屋价格不再上涨，棚屋净值不再增加，短期炒房也就无利可图。没有了利益的诱惑，过高的贷款额度成了无法承受的负担。\n有些借款人本来买不起棚屋，他们希望通过棚屋的快速倒手获利或者得到“以小换大”的贷款，等到暂时处于低位的诱惑利率调高以后，这些人马上就无力承担棚屋贷款，局势变得更加复杂。由于棚屋的价值小于贷款的金额，人们都想从巨额贷款中脱身。那些零首付购买棚屋的人尤其如此。这些借款人前期没有任何资金保证，就算不偿还贷款，让银行收回棚屋也没什么损失。\n由于越来越多的借款人拖欠还贷，曼尼贷款证券化业务很快宣告破产。久负盛名的曼尼遭受了巨大的损失，一蹶不振。很快，“两棚”也宣告破产。\n因为消费者不再投资棚屋，其相关产业也陷入了困境。大批棚屋建筑工人、设计顾问、橱窗布置员和电器销售人员纷纷失业。\n其他看似毫不相干的产业也受到了冲击。当初，“以小换大”贷款大行其道时，美索尼亚国驴车制造商大赚了一笔。那时，棚屋不断升值，岛民不费吹灰之力就赚得盆满钵满，买的车越来越大。在棚屋市场最繁荣的那些年，很多驴车都大到需要四五头驴来拉。（问题是，大多数的驴都要靠进口。）一旦棚屋市场无利可图，这些“草老虎”的销量也一落千丈，驴车公司相继破产。\n小岛陷入了历史上最严重的一次经济危机。失业工人们走投无路，都聚集到参议院门前讨说法。\n经济刺激援助计划\n议长乔治·W·巴斯多年来一直不承认岛上的经济有问题，现在后知后觉的他终于开始着手解决问题。\n他的顾问一致认为应该推出大胆的刺激政策，让人们重新开始消费，尤其是购买棚屋。议长并不理解为什么储蓄和生产能够促进经济增长，但他仍然决定推出大规模的援助和刺激计划。\n“两棚”最先得到了援助。参议院接管了“两棚”，注入了大笔的鱼邦储备券以弥补损失。重组之后，“两棚”按照新管理层（即参议院）的意愿，向所有填写贷款申请表的人发放超低利率的棚屋贷款。\n它们希望通过持续发放宽松信贷，提高市场对棚屋的需求，从而阻止棚屋价格继续下跌。\n后来，由于这些政策没能挽回局面，巴斯叫来了所有的高级顾问，召开紧急会议。其中包括本·伯南柯，他曾向巴斯保证繁荣盛世会永远持续下去。\n“我说，小伯。”巴斯用他标志性的平易近人的态度说道，“我让你给骗了。我以为经济是件很简单的事呢。你知道，他们流汗，我们吃鱼，每个人都能有一两套棚屋！我们这回怎么才能让鲨鱼上钩呢？”\n其他参议员都在苦苦思索他这句话的寓意。也许真有什么寓意吧。\n“阁下，事情其实很简单。”新任首席会计师汉克·普兰克顿说道，“现在棚屋价格猛跌，人们觉得自己没有以前富裕了。因此，他们停止了消费。如果我们能把棚屋价格推高，人们自然就会开始消费。”\n“太好了，小普。就知道你有高招。”巴斯说，“那怎么才能做到呢？有人负责吗？这工作听起来很酷。也许我可以让我的某个最大捐助人来干。”\n“阁下，并没有那么简单。”普兰克顿说。“我们无法下令让棚屋价格回升。你知道，因为有我们的支持，‘两棚’在继续放贷。不幸的是，这还不够。人们还是不愿意贷款，也许是因为申请贷款的过程过于复杂。现在我们需要调低利率，减少棚屋购置税。这样就会产生贷款需求，棚屋价格就会止跌，棚屋建筑工人也能回到工作岗位上去。”\n普兰克顿继续解释他的计划：“我们还要保持曼尼的偿付能力。这家公司欠民众很多钱。如果它倒闭了，整个国家的经济也就完了。我们要保证曼尼所有的投资者都不会蒙受损失，否则我们都要忍饥挨饿，尤其是孩子们。”\n故事引申\n岛上最不需要的就是更多的棚屋。棚屋已经够多了，任何用于棚屋建设的资源和人力都是浪费。\n同理，棚屋价格已经够高了。棚屋价格涨到如此令人咋舌的水平，是很多因素共同作用的结果，而这些因素已经一去不返了。要遏制棚屋价格下跌的趋势，就像阻止一座没有任何支撑的桥倒塌一样困难。\n虽然很多岛民都因为棚屋价格下跌而惴惴不安，但是如果任由棚屋价格下跌，同时停止建造新的棚屋，反而对岛上的经济有好处，至少在真正的需求出现之前是这样。这样一来，人们就不会花那么多钱购买棚屋，而是把钱花在那些经济发展中缺乏的东西上，比如新企业可能只需要一头驴拉的驴车。原本用于建设棚屋的资源，比如竹子和绳子，也可以用于新的行业。\n不幸的是，政府的干预阻碍了这种资源再分配。\n“放心，小普，只要有我在，绝不会发生这种事。”巴斯回答说，“告诉他们，我们会出资纾困。我说，你以前不是在那家公司工作过吗？”\n“是的，议长阁下。我以前是那家公司的总裁。但是我认为这和我们的对话无关。说实话，我很不喜欢你这种影射的说法。”\n“咳，小普，我跟你开玩笑呢。”巴斯继续说，“好吧。咱们先抬高棚屋价格，让曼尼维持业务，然后我们怎么让人们再度开始消费呢？鱼从哪儿来？我的意思是，据我所知，渔业部遇到了点儿麻烦。这不就是他们拿着干草叉在外面示威的原因吗？”\n“阁下，我们计划向人们发放新的鱼邦储备券。有了钱，人们就会开始消费了。”\n“太酷了。但是我们去哪儿弄鱼呢？我们的技师不是已经没办法了吗？”\n“阁下，中岛帝国人向我们做了新的承诺。他们愿意用10万条鱼买我们的自来水系统。”\n“等一下。卖掉自来水系统？这会威胁到我们的国家安全！我要是把这样的东西卖给外国人，岛民们肯定饶不了我。不能让他们向我们提供贷款吗？”\n经过数月的紧张谈判，巴斯的大使终于说服中岛帝国的代表，让他们明白美索尼亚国出于政治上的原因无法出售自来水系统。结果，中岛帝国颇不情愿地同意了一项10万条鱼的贷款。\n“嘿，汉克。”得知喜讯后巴斯说，“好消息，我们拿到贷款了。只有一个问题，我们拿什么还贷呢？”\n“阁下，我们只需要再印一堆鱼邦储备券就行了。不过这次，我们要用最好的纸。”\n“嗯，如果他们不接受怎么办？不是已经有不少人对我们钞票的价值说三道四了吗？就像前几年的那个查克·小鼓一样。如果我们发行更多的钞票，他们不会开始抛售吗？”\n“几乎不可能，阁下。你想一想，他们手里已经有很多钞票了。如果他们不接受，那些钞票只会更加贬值。他们现在只能任由我们摆布。要是情况有变，我们就提醒他们，我们还有‘强鱼政策’。”\n“对啊，我都给忘了。有这个政策真好。我们是不是要全面出动，捕更多的鱼支撑我们的钞票？”\n“不是的，阁下。”本·伯南柯插话说，“强鱼政策只是说说而已。我们实际上什么也不用做。我们只需要反复清楚而大声地强调‘强鱼政策’。另外，你在说这几个字时，攥紧拳头敲桌子效果会更好。”\n“太对了，小伯，我在假装强硬上还是很有天赋的。圆满完成任务！走，冲浪去！”\n现实链接\n繁荣的房市对整个经济的影响至关重要。在房市繁荣的巅峰时期，房屋的融资、建设和装修成了美国经济的中流砥柱。然而，每个人都只看到了眼前的好运，却没注意到未来的损失。\n不仅“炒房者”赚到了大量财富，普通房主们每年也通过“以小换大”贷款获得数千亿美元。如此一来，房产成了免税的自动提款机。人们用这些钱翻新房屋、度假、上大学以及买车和电子产品，总体生活水平比房屋升值前提高了。\n但是，这些财富不过是海市蜃楼。\n罗伯特·席勒在《非理性繁荣》（Irrational Exuberance）一书中写道，在1900\\~2000年这100年的时间里，美国的房价平均每年上涨3.4%（只比平均通货膨胀率略高）。这是相当合理的。物价与人们的购买力密切相关，这也是收入和信贷可得性的作用之一。\n然而，1997\\~2006年，全美房价平均每年上涨19.4%，涨幅惊人。在此期间，收入却鲜有提高。那么人们是如何支付高昂的购房款的呢？这两个时期的区别在于信贷的多寡。后期美国政府制定了许多政策，贷款利率更低，获得贷款也更容易。但是信贷不会永远扩张，最终贷款条件会变得更严格。一旦信贷收缩，房价就不可能再升高了。\n所以，房市达到巅峰时，多年来不断涌入经济体中的低息贷款停止了。即便在房市开始萧条之后没有其他的经济问题（实际上是有问题的），没有了那些自由现金流，经济也一定会萎缩。为了恢复经济平衡，经济衰退不是必需的，却是必要的。\n但是，当经济开始收紧时，立法者和经济学家不仅不认为这一过程是多年来银根松动以及过度消费的结果，反而把它当作问题本身。换句话说，他们错把解药当作毒药。\n小布什和奥巴马政府一直都鼓励消费者像房市崩溃之前那样消费。但是钱从哪儿来？如果失业率上升，收入和房价下降，消费者怎么会有这么多钱？\n经济学家宣称，如果人们不能消费，政府就应该采取措施帮助他们消费。但是，政府也没有多少钱。政府所有的就是税收、贷款和自己印刷的货币。税金和借款只是将私营部门的花销或投资转嫁到政府头上，印制货币也会产生同样的效果。政府将新发行的货币投入流通领域，必然会抑制老百姓手中所持货币的购买力。\n最近一次经济崩溃之后的几年，印制货币的做法带来了巨大的贸易逆差，达到了每年一万亿美元。幸运的是，我们依然能够在公开市场上出售大部分债务，当然主要是针对外国买家。但是，美国也采取了更简单（也更不坦诚）的方式避免损失，即通过美联储将相当一部分债务卖给了美国自己。\n但是，美国不会一直拥有这样的“好运”。最终美国政府只有两个选择：拒绝还款（告诉债主美国没钱，并商议一个解决办法），或者通货膨胀（印钱来还债）。任何一个选择的后果都很严重。拒绝还款还有可能彻底清算从头来过，是相对较好的选择。不幸的是，虽然通货膨胀在经济上影响相对较差，但是在政治上有好处。第十六章\n情形怎么变得如此糟糕\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n虽然巴斯和普兰克顿推出了援助和刺激政策，美索尼亚国的经济在棚屋大萧条中还是持续恶化。奇怪的是，没人有购买棚屋的意愿。一些岛民认为刺激政策中的鱼不该用来消费，而是应该将它们储蓄起来。由于消费停滞，驴车公司都到了崩溃的边缘。棚得宝也破产了。失业问题愈加严重。岛上民怨沸腾。\n因此，下一次大选至关重要。总议长候选人巴里·奥库达指责巴斯集团“国难当头，无所作为”。他揶揄说，巴斯的政策都是微不足道的折中政策。奥库达的竞选主题是变革，他承诺要让政府尽最大的努力挽救美索尼亚国的经济。\n年轻的奥库达掌权以后改变了巴斯的政策，将刺激计划扩大为原来的三倍。他还设计了很多新的计划，将新印刷的鱼邦储备券注入市场。\n他提高了政府为购买棚屋者提供的援助金额（开始时只有第一次购买棚屋者享有，后来“以小换大”的购买者也获得了资格），并再次调低了“两棚”的贷款利率。\n他注意到冲浪学校的入学率大幅下降，于是增加了对学校的直接援助，并放宽了助学贷款的条件。\n他还批准在背阴沼泽建造一座新的灯塔。工程师们指出这座灯塔毫无用处，奥库达告诉他们，建筑工程所提供的就业岗位本身就能对经济起到强大的促进作用。\n奥库达还坚信有必要开发替代能源。他指出：“社会太依赖驴子了。美洲驼更适合我们的气候和地貌。美洲驼不仅吃草少，而且步履更稳健，性情更温和，繁殖速度也比驴子快。更重要的是，美洲驼粪便的气味没有那么难闻。”\n奥库达设想了一个多步骤的计划，用以改变经济状况。\n第一，他将利用大规模的刺激政策，加快以美洲驼为基础的基础设施建设。为此，他号召设立一项美洲驼繁衍计划，由政府拨款。他还命令驴车生产厂家（现在由政府直接掌管）重新设计车子，以适应美洲驼的特点。另外，他要求在岛上所有的车道上面铺上一层适合美洲驼踩踏的土。\n第二，奥库达想出了一个“驴车换鲤鱼”计划。政府提供优惠，鼓励人们上交“草老虎”，换取能效更高的车子。（这对中岛帝国人来说是个天大的喜讯，因为大部分的小型车都是他们制造的。）\n奥库达和他在参议院的帮手南·莎洛西正准备花费新印刷出来的成堆的钞票，但他们忽略了一个小小的细节：美索尼亚国已经完全没有存鱼了。他们所计划的所有开销都要依靠外国的资金支持。\n只有外国人愿意用实实在在的货物换取他们的纸币，美索尼亚人才能维持消费大于产出的生活。因此，他们的选择很简单：\n1．减少消费，用储蓄还债；\n2．增大产量，卖掉多余的货物还债；\n3．追加贷款，继续保持现有的消费水平。\n在前两个选择中，美索尼亚人都要吃苦。要么努力工作，要么减少消费，再不然就是双管齐下。而第三种选择可以把一切痛苦转嫁给外国人。毫无疑问，参议员们勇敢地选择让外国人当替罪羊。通过这些措施，他们希望恢复消费支出，重新建立国内健康的经济环境。\n故事引申\n很多人想当然地认为，类似“驴车换鲤鱼”的计划具有正面影响，背阴沼泽建筑计划创造了就业岗位。这些方案确实增加了消费，创造了就业岗位，这是显而易见的。\n但是，就像参议院出资的棚屋贷款一样，这些绝不是利用岛上资源的最有效的方式。实际上，这些活动都不能扩大产能。\n人们看不到的是，由于稀有的劳动力和资源都用在了参议院认为比较重要的活动上，导致很多其他的就业岗位和本来可能形成的岗位受到损失。\n通过反复的实验，市场的力量会找出使用这些投资资本的最佳方式。如果企业因为误读市场而蒙受损失，投资者就会及时抽身。如果企业顺应市场要求并获得利润，就会吸引更多的资金，从而扩大产能。\n这些资源如果用于制作渔网、农业用具和独木舟，效果会更好。最成功的企业应该是在人们最需要的时候生产他们最需要的东西。然而，现在很明显人们已经不再相信自由市场，所有人都寄希望于一小撮人，希望他们能够为整个岛做决定。\n但是，要记住，一国的经济不会因为人们的消费而增长，而是经济增长带动人们的消费。参议员们和顾问们都没能抓住这个真理。与此同时，大把大把的新钞票营造了经济有所好转的假象。\n失业人员获悉，就业岗位在美索尼亚国迅速消失的同时，却在中岛帝国以同样的速度增加。原因在于中岛帝国买了很多鱼邦储备券，抬高了鱼邦储备券的价值，中岛帝国的产品就变得物美价廉，无法抗拒了。所以，奥库达和莎洛西公开要求中岛帝国少买些鱼邦储备券，令其贬值，从而使美索尼亚国的产品更有竞争力。\n当然，没人想过鱼邦储备券是他们筹款的方式，中岛帝国如果减持鱼邦储备券，怎么还能把鱼借给他们，用以支持奥库达设想的消费计划呢？他们甚至不屑于思考这个问题。参议员们只想着借钱，却忘了总要有人可借才行。\n一些岛民开始担心政府为了偿还债务而过度借贷。为了安抚民众的恐慌情绪，参议院对借款的上限进行了设定，他们称之为“债务屋顶”。这一合法的遮羞布使那些参议员可以两头获益。借款的硬上限会造成一个假象：人们以为参议院真的打算解决财政问题。但事实上，每当快要达到借款上限时，他们都可以随时抬高债务屋顶。尽管一些有责任感的议员会站出来阻止过度借贷，对不断提高债务最高上限持反对意见，可他们往往被歪曲为拒绝支付小岛账单的寄生虫，没有一丝责任感。奥库达向其他参议员保证，这个小岛的媒体对他们会唯命是从，可以依靠这些媒体来说服投资者们，使他们相信自始至终不负责任的做法其实很负责任。奥库达说得没错。极为讽刺的是，这个“债务屋顶”居然为参议院顶破债务屋顶提供了完美的掩护！\n现实链接\n一两年后，几份GDP报告（这些报告本身也许并不可靠）少有地出现正增长态势，一些经济学家向我们宣布，经济大萧条结束了，真正的经济复苏马上就要开始了。但此时，失业率仍然处于历史最高点，待遇优厚的制造业岗位持续减少，而薪资低、技术门槛低的服务业岗位则不断增加，许多美国人听到这样的好消息，也许会大吃一惊吧。\n实际上，这次经济危机已经促使经济恢复平衡，这个过程会很痛苦，而且远未结束。2009年，美国的存款率多年来首次升高，贸易逆差在飙升10年后也开始萎缩。但是，小布什和奥巴马政府的刺激计划结束了这一进程。美国人本该回到与生产力相称的生活水平上去，但他们的计划制造了更加巨大的债务，从而延缓了这个过程。\n但是，在不久的将来，也许就在几年以后，巨大的债务终需偿还。从前那些繁荣的欧洲国家正中债务危机的子弹，到目前为止，美国还算成功地避开了这颗可怕的子弹。现在，美国暂时躲过一拳。不幸的是，美国的预算赤字年年增长，社会保障和医疗保险体系濒临崩溃（一部分原因是婴儿潮一代退休引起的人口结构上的变化），所以这一拳迟早会来，而且会更有力。\n美国政府没有显示出任何解决该问题的意愿。它们从来没有考虑过大幅削减政府支出的可能性，更别说尝试那样做了。奥巴马总统刚上任时，他要求“逐句”审查三万亿美元的联邦预算，以找出“无用的开销”，但这不过是作秀而已。结果只是节省了微不足道的170亿美元，还不到整个预算的0.5%。而那些提倡削减预算的人也遭到了民主党和共和党的猛烈抨击。\n如果美国政府不在财政上严于律己，美国的债权人（主要是中国和日本）迟早会要求美国那么做。债权人可以选择多种方式让美国就范，最有效的一招就是停止购买美国的国债。\n目前，这些国家的处境与中岛帝国相似。一旦它们认识到不断向一个付不起账的顾客借钱是件浪费资源的事，就会改弦更张。那时它们就会把生产力集中到国内消费者身上，它们就能完全享受自己的劳动果实了。\n目前，国际上要求金融改革的呼声高涨，这些国家虽然也怨言不断，但它们还是继续借钱给美国。但是，它们的忍耐是有限度的。\n现在美国一半以上的政府债务都卖给了外国政府，如果它们拒绝继续购买，谁来买美国的国债？美国国内可用的储蓄少得可怜，美国人自己解决不了这个问题。\n等到那一天到来，美国有两种选择：拒绝还款或通货膨胀。不论选哪一个，由于购买力下降和利率升高，美国人的生活水平都会急剧下降。第十七章\n缓兵之计\nHOW

CRASHES\n奥库达与莎洛西满心期待他们的各项新计划能为这座小岛带来极大繁荣，可此时海外接连发生的几件大事完全抢走了他们的风头。朱特尼亚群岛爆发了一次更加严重的棚屋崩溃风暴。那里孕育着悠久的历史与灿烂的文明，气候温和宜人，不远处就是以海上夜生活闻名的小鼓岛。于是一座座海滨度假棚屋拔地而起，棚屋建设和买卖的热潮吸引着四面八方的投资者，他们将大量的鱼投资在这里。随着鱼越来越多地涌入群岛，新的银行和投资基金也纷纷建立起来。用于度假棚屋建设的大部分鱼是通过几个投资方案筹集的，而这些方案都是基于金融巨头曼尼先生开创的那些投资模式设计的。建棚热带来的其他活动不断渗透到当地经济的各个方面，这就意味着朱特尼亚群岛的居民可以过上他们根本担负不起的奢侈生活。于是，这里成了吃空饷、悠闲生活以及提早退休的代名词。\n但好景不长，美索尼亚的历史在这里重演了。朱特尼亚群岛的棚屋供过于求的问题终于演变为棚屋大萧条危机，此时那些野心勃勃的银行和投资基金陷入了严重的困境，许多投资者也仓促地撤出了现金。鉴于这些做法，朱特尼亚群岛的各类基金迅速跌至谷底，拥有此类资产的各大银行很快也面临着全面破产。于是，各岛政府忙不迭地从其他岛贷款，帮助本地银行摆脱困境。这样的做法总算解了燃眉之急，但很快，许多人意识到，朱特尼亚群岛的各级政府实际上对债务清偿问题也是一筹莫展，日子不比他们岌岌可危的银行好过到哪儿去。于是，一场银行业危机演变成了一场波及多岛的政府债务危机。\n在这个紧急关头，一个名为IMF（岛际海上渔民组织）的跨洋机构仓促成立，并立即推出了一项计划。\nIMF代表大洋上每个发达岛屿的利益，它从美索尼亚借来了数额巨大的鱼邦储备券（目前仍被视为最可靠的货币），并将这些储备券贷给举步维艰的朱特尼亚群岛各政府。IMF相信，在事态发展到无法收拾的地步之前遏制住这场棚屋危机，符合整个大洋的利益。\n有了IMF提供的鱼邦储备券，朱特尼亚政府就能够兑现其向公民和外国债权人做出的承诺。那些已经退休的人得知不用再次工作，都松了一口气。他们中有许多人最近刚从冲浪学校毕业，满心期盼着能再一次过上那种慵懒、悠闲的慢节奏生活。\n虽然IMF提供的紧急财政援助贷款的利息很低，朱特尼亚政府仍然需要用真鱼来偿还债务（其实他们连偿还本金的能力都不具备，但似乎根本没人在意这件事）。\n尽管面临着来自IMF的巨大压力，朱特尼亚群岛各政府并没有推行任何行之有效的改革，结果就连利息的支付也成了巨大的负担。考虑到这里的政府腐败，百姓养尊处优，好吃懒做，他们会不断逃避自身的责任，IMF强制要求该群岛接受了一项“刚性”计划，其中包含提高税收以及减少政府支出等内容。这一计划遭到了当地居民的强烈抵制，他们觉得好像自己的岛屿被不怀好意的外岛人控制了。\n而美索尼亚就要幸运得多。朱特尼亚群岛出现的诸多问题极大地分散了美索尼亚民众对国内矛盾的注意力。面对朱特尼亚的危机，整个大洋的投资者的反应都是：从该群岛撤出所有鱼，不再与这里的任何基金有任何瓜葛。很多人开始把存款转到鱼邦储备银行，毕竟这里一直是公认的规模最大、资金存储最充足的机构。事实上，美索尼亚的经济状况也是岌岌可危，甚至比许多岛屿还要糟糕，但这种状况似乎并没有给存款人带来多大困扰。实际上，美索尼亚能有惊无险地度过这次危机，完全仰仗该国令人钦佩的历史和持久稳定的声誉，人们始终相信该国银行是不会破产的。\n奥库达将意外之财投入自己的部分危机后应急项目中。他要求失业的渔民也要承担还款的责任，增加了冲浪学校学生贷款的鱼的数额，并且极大地拓展了鱼邮票项目。\n虽然有些人最担心的结果并未出现，但美索尼亚仍未脱离困境。鱼的数量已经不足，新公司也无法像过去那样不断涌现，工作岗位少得可怜，明显供不应求。仅存的一线希望来自冲浪学校，该校吸引着越来越多的生源，学费也在持续上涨。鉴于当前经济停滞不前的现状，岛上的很多人都对未来的种种不确定性忧心忡忡，于是采取了明智的做法：他们几乎苛刻地自我约束着，不断降低消费，重新储蓄。\n但当人们降低消费时，商店和企业就不得不做出调整。随着待售的存货越积越多，许多商家只好大幅降价，以吸引广大顾客。但价格的持续走低，也就是人们所说的通鱼紧缩，开始成为伯南柯担心的主要问题。他认为，价格下跌是自弗兰基·迪普时代的大鲨鱼泛滥以来最危险的经济威胁，且不论当年还曾连续几年禁渔了。伯南柯指出，一旦老百姓认为自己想要的东西将来总会降价，他们就会一再推迟购买时间。从理论上讲，如果价格持续下跌，人们就有可能一直等下去，直到所有东西都免费白送。如果那种情况真的发生了，那所有的企业都会破产，全岛的经济会立即退回到网前时代（pre-net era）。\n对此，他提出了一个名为“定量鱼券”的方案，这个独特的新方法旨在通过向经济中注入新的“鱼邦储备券”来刺激需求。\n但这个方案不是把钱直接送到老百姓手里（这样做看起来像是政府凭空创造出了许多鱼邦储备券一般），伯南柯提议通过曼尼的投资（尤其是那些针对破旧棚屋区改造的投资）注入这些鱼券，而曼尼的再融资基金随后便会展开自己的各项投资活动，以需求促进经济增长。一旦经济状况看似有所好转，人们就会开始消费，就好像一切真的好起来了一样。\n消费会推动价格上涨，经济得以健康发展。错综复杂的融资渠道使经济本身看似逐渐好转。然而，参议院的某些议员却提出质疑：这样一套人为系统是否具备长期的可行性？伯南柯向所有人保证说，这项计划只是临时性的。\n这一方案最终被定名为“定量鱼券1号方案”，即QF1。该方案的推出备受推崇。华孚街（Wharf Street）再现昔日繁华，大批渔船来到这里，但这次船上堆满了钞票，而不是一堆堆腐烂的鱼。这些钞票直接送到了曼尼的办公室，这些钱要用来买进拖欠的棚屋贷款，重新投资岌岌可危的企业，为学生提供低价的贷款等等。于是，棚屋价格停止下跌，逐渐稳定，最终开始上涨。人们觉得比之前富足，于是开始消费，价格也开始上涨。一切都呈现出欣欣向荣的景象。\n现实链接\n从2010年起，全世界都将目光聚焦在一出慢动作戏剧上，这出戏就是将所谓“PIGS”（即葡萄牙、意大利、希腊和西班牙）国家卷入泥潭的债务危机。这些国家都有着阳光充足的地中海气候、璀璨富有的历史以及待遇丰厚的社会保障体系，除此之外，它们还都是欧盟成员，其负债水平也都远远超出本国经济的发展。尽管每个国家都面临着严峻的挑战，希腊却不幸成为这次危机的靶子。\n就其经济状况的荒唐程度而言，希腊的确是个例外。据一份未经证实的财务报表（其中部分由美国投资银行高盛设计，该银行曾涉嫌金融欺诈）显示，希腊2001年获准进入欧元区，开始使用强劲稳健的欧元作为流通货币，作为回报，希腊要在欧元区严格的财政指导下发展经济。但是，南北欧之间政治独立与文化差异结合方式的大不同会导致严重的货币混乱局面，而那些一心想推行单一通货的设计师当时并未意识到这一点。\n尽管希腊从2004\\~2006年的房地产建设热潮中获益不少，但到了2010年，一个事实却越来越清晰：这个国家已经无望偿还已有的债务，更没有可能兑现自己对公民的承诺了。希腊成了一个臭名昭著的国家，成了短期工作、长期罢工、提早退休、连续逃税的代名词。通常来说，一个国家沦落到希腊这样的地步，会通过否认债务或货币贬值来应对危机。但作为欧元区的一员，这些做法希腊一样也不能采用。\n这一事件导致的政治与经济危机，使欧洲连年稳居全球经济新闻头条。这对美国来讲倒是幸事，欧洲的诸多问题对美国而言，无异于天赐良机。希腊首都雅典大街上游行的人群不仅是经济恶化的醒目标志，还使恐惧蔓延，令整个欧洲大陆深陷泥潭。这样的剧变使许多投资基金转而越过大西洋，去寻找更安全的避风港。于是，在美国经济亟须支撑之时，大量资金及时涌入美国。讽刺的是，许多经济学家对此的评论居然是，欧洲的问题已经成为美国经济的负担，然而实际上，这些问题带给美国的明明是一种福祉。\n尽管希腊的经济状况远不能跟美国相提并论，但并不是整个欧洲大陆都不如美国。事实上，德国（毋庸置疑是推动整个欧元区发展的经济强国）的经济状况远好于美国，但欧元区至少得共同面对债务管理失控的困境。美国政府也要做出与欧盟类似的努力才行。虽然欧洲的政治联盟仍有待完善，至少该组织还没有为欧洲开出那一剂最危险的经济药方：量化宽松。\n2008年之前，量化宽松这一概念尚未普及，只有大学经济学系的学生听说过。而过去几年间，量化宽松已被越来越多的人视为影响股票、债券和房地产走势最重要的因素。尽管很多人知道美国依赖量化宽松，但很少有人真正看透其本质：向金融市场注入新的资金，以推动价格上涨。实际上，量化宽松不过是通货膨胀的一种委婉表达，它也成为美联储将政府债务货币化的隐秘手段。\n但想用量化宽松政策来修复萎靡的经济，就好比企图用汽油去救火一样，汽油越多，火势就越旺。如果不知道汽油具有可燃性，你可能会得出这样的结论：火没扑灭是因为汽油的量不够大。要是这样的误解不消除，形势就会持续恶化，直到火势失去控制。这不正是美国当前经济状况的真实写照么？！\n正如本书前文所述，大多数经济学家认为，消费会促进经济增长。增加货币供应量固然会鼓励人们消费，但对扩大需求却毫无裨益，而需求才是促进经济增长的真正动力。第十八章\n占领华孚街\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n定量鱼券计划实施的头几个月，貌似取得了不错的成效，而此时，伯南柯却决定按照最初的规划逐渐停止这项计划。他认为定量鱼券计划已经达到既定目标：阻止价格下跌，使消费者重获信心，开始消费。然而，伯南柯未能考虑到经济反弹（其实不过是抬高棚屋价格和持有棚屋贷款的各项基金的价格而已）的整个过程如何建立在干预本身的基础之上。这座小岛越来越依赖定量鱼券，该计划一叫停，经济泡沫便开始破灭。导火索似乎并未点燃实体经济那根更笨重的木头，由于债务、通鱼膨胀以及政府花销等诸多问题，那根木头一直都太过潮湿了。\n因此，当渔船满载着真鱼（而不是定量鱼券）开进华孚街时，恐慌便蔓延开来。曼尼棚屋基金的经理们不能再指望还有闲钱注入，只好相应缩减自己的投资。当各项基金停止发放新的棚屋贷款时，棚屋购买需求便一落千丈，价格也随之骤然下降。\n此次经济下滑立刻引起了伯南柯的注意。他不甘心让此前施行的定量鱼券计划前功尽弃，于是敦促鱼邦储备银行推出新一轮定量鱼券，也就是后来人们熟知的“定量鱼券2号方案”。这一次发行的定量鱼券数量和1号方案等量。因此，一艘艘船又一次送来了鱼券，华孚街上的人们紧绷的神经总算放松下来，基金价格回升，棚屋市场再一次稳定下来。\n伯南柯向每个人保证，这次计划和第一次一样，只是临时性的。但是，当第二次定量鱼券计划完成时，经济发展再度停滞。然而这次失败并没有让伯南柯重新评估自己的伟大想法。同时，他也不希望人们完全看透自己，于是他提出了一项名为“压缩操作”（Operation Squish）的计划。这个计划不是简单地发行新鱼券，而是指导鱼邦储备银行将现有的短期贷款换为期限较长的新型贷款，从而延长还款期，让那些偿付高昂棚屋贷款非常吃力的人每月少还些钱。尽管较低的利息有助于缓和局势，可终归无法平息华孚街上不断高涨的呼声，那里的人们希望再来一波鱼券。\n最终，伯南柯决定尽量满足市场需求。为避免经历极有可能十分尴尬的考验，他没有再次宣布实施临时计划，而是公布了一项开放式的定量鱼券计划。该计划将一直执行下去，直到那些永久性债务偿清之日为止。华孚街上沸腾了，这项被民众称为“无限期定量鱼券”计划的新项目，为人们带来了一个清晰的、可以预见的未来，当然还有大量的免费鱼。最重要的是，该计划以迅猛之势抬高了棚屋价格，曼尼那些原本脆弱的投资计划身价也上涨了。一些观察员强烈反对这一计划，那位坚定的怀疑论者派克·希夫先生便是其中一位。然而，岛上大多数著名经济学家的建议如出一辙，他们指出人们只需紧跟潮流即可。他们说：“浪打来时，聪明人是不会问问题的，他们只会紧紧抓住自己的滑板。”\n正当华孚街大肆庆祝之时，岛上其他地方仍举步维艰。许多人注意到，官鱼变得越来越小（尽管不断有报道称通鱼膨胀已经结束），失业率仍然居高不下。选民们原本对奥库达期待很高。而今，人们对他承诺的变革再也不抱任何幻想了。\n在很多心怀不满的人看来，华孚街置身经济阴霾之外是显失公平的。他们觉得，毕竟是曼尼及其同伴为人们提供了根本无力偿还的贷款，从而加速了经济的崩溃。许多人甚至怀疑曼尼曾使用不正当手段，强迫岛上居民购买他们根本不需要或不想要的棚屋。有人甚至断言银行家用催眠术诱骗了岛民。\n但当棚屋价格暴跌时，华孚街上却没有一个人愿意承担责任。棚屋贷款基金得到了鱼邦储备银行和定量鱼券计划的救助。实际上，此时华孚街上的基金价格比以往任何时候都要高。为了抚平人们心头的愤怒，伯南柯称，曼尼和他的朋友们“对我们至关重要，绝不能置之不理”，小岛会利用所有的资源助力曼尼基金平稳着陆。华孚街的经纪人似乎从未经历过他们强加于别人身上的痛苦。\n很快，一个由失业工人、心怀不满的棚屋购买者以及难以承受巨额助学贷款重压的年轻人组成的临时联盟去往各个码头，决心要像往常一样关闭企业。他们发起的“占领华孚街”运动激起了公众的想象力，成为后危机时代挫败的象征。\n故事引申\n那些愤怒的抗议者并未搞清楚，他们愤怒的矛头其实指错了对象。曼尼和他的下属不应该为这次混乱负责，该负责任的是巴斯、奥库达、格林芬和伯南柯这些人。要不是那些政客和银行家，华孚街上的融资者们早就顺理成章地被赶出华孚街了。尽管“占领华孚街”从未真正发展为政治运动，但政客们看到讨伐的双拳挥向了错误的方向，心中还是暗自窃喜。许多精明的参议员投票支持紧急援助，实际上是和那些抗议者站在同一战线上的。\n经济复苏缓慢，令人们沮丧和困惑。在下次选举中，经济问题将成为选民关心的头等大事。与奥库达同台竞选的对手中，有位外表斯文、发型讲究的米奇·卢斐先生。起初，卢斐利用民众不断高涨的“反奥库达”情绪，略占上风，但由于其财力雄厚，而且担任过华孚街的执行官，再加上他对任何议题都没有一个坚定的立场，许多选民便对他失去信任，渐渐疏远。后来人们发现，他居然在一个外国的地下室里藏有私鱼，此时其候选人地位几乎不保了。\n参与竞选的还有另一位候选人唐·佩奇博士，一名现任参议员。唐·佩奇称，奥库达和卢斐提出的方案大同小异。而小岛现在需要的就是重拾昔日创造辉煌时的理念：鱼的大小合理，政府有所节制，民众争相储蓄、努力工作，以及充分尊重第一代捕鱼者留下的规矩等等。只可惜，小岛的媒体过于迷恋几位领先的候选人散发出的明星魅力，没有精力去关注一匹黑马。\n幸好唐·佩奇博士的儿子桑迪·佩奇博士在其父退休之后，也坐稳了参议员的位置。\n由于两位人气候选人奥库达和卢斐的观点几乎没有实质性区别，于是，两个人身上的符号便成了民众瞩目的焦点。针对卢斐容易引发阶级不满情绪这一弱点，奥库达提议，富人阶层应该提高纳税额，这才是经济复兴的关键所在。尽管卢斐争辩说，政府支出会带来更大的危险，但其私藏的那成堆成堆的鱼，使他很容易成为公众迁怒的对象。最终，连帅气的发型也救不了他了。\n奥库达连任之后，参议院部分议员试图通过一些小举措削减政府支出。一些人甚至建议，要相应裁掉在背阴沼泽灯塔工作的员工（其实看上去没太大用处）。奥库达和莎洛西对此表示强烈反对。吉尔·格鲁曼教授（小岛上备受赞誉的经济学家）解释道，政府支出的使用远不及支出本身重要。他甚至建议，政府可以着手准备全面防范小鼓岛的新一轮入侵，借此推动经济的发展。而事实上小鼓岛目前一派安定，入侵一说根本就是捕风捉影。\n但参议院最终还是避开了有关富人增税和政府支出的艰难决策，转而实施了一项名为“海洋探索者”的方案，包括适度增税以及政府支出随意“削减”等一系列措施。但是，该方案引发了民众的强烈抗议。格鲁曼本人指出，不管多大幅度的削减，都会导致“财政悬崖”的危险情形，即遭到削减的政府支出会抑制需求，使小岛陷入经济衰退的窘境。\n同时，伯南柯开始警告人们，如果银行不发行更多的定量鱼券，价格将会面临全面下跌的危险。岛上的居民都不理解为什么价格下跌成了一个问题，如果生活必需品的价格下降了，人们不就能买更多自己需要的东西了吗？就连商人也希望物价下跌。成本下降了，他们就可以利用省出来的钱为顾客提供优惠，也能售出更多的商品。尽管这个道理看似简单，但伯南柯和格鲁曼却使人们相信，经济学是一门科学，只有受过多年学校教育的人才会明白其中的奥秘。此外，两人的胡须都相当迷人，这一点在民众心中是加分项。\n不久之后，有人开始想，小岛要怎样才能恢复正常秩序？有人甚至直言不讳地指出：当前经济过于依赖定量鱼券。为了缓解民众的紧张情绪，伯南柯宣布，他可以利用“退出策略”这一绝招逐步结束定量鱼券的使命。但伯南柯内心明白自己不过是在虚张声势。他知道，没有了银行的支持，曼尼的基金会崩溃，棚屋市场会一蹶不振，政府也将丧失偿还债务的能力。但伯南柯是决然不会承认这一点的。于是，“退出策略”的谎言越编越长，直到他编不下去为止。随着时间流逝，他的预测越来越含糊，他的承诺也附带了更多条件。伯南柯延迟的窘迫局面越多，问题就变得越严重。\n故事引申\n在经济发展的迷茫期，收入的减少和对未来的恐惧会限制众多购物者的消费行为，此时，物价下跌会激起人们再次消费的欲望。所以，物价的确会对低迷的经济产生自然的刺激。在20世纪30年代的大萧条时期，物价暴跌。尽管许多现代经济学家认为，当时暴跌的物价是那场大萧条的诱因，而非其产物，但有一点毋庸置疑，那就是，当人们找不到工作时，生活必需品的价格下降至少会带给他们一些安慰。按照那些经济学家的说法，如果人们必须同时面对上升的失业率和上涨的物价，他们的日子能好过吗？\n与20世纪30年代那场大萧条不同，在2008\\~2010年的经济衰退期，生活消费品的价格从未下降。考虑到当时的经济混乱是由人们对投机极度狂热所导致的，古典经济学本来可以预测到这场混乱过后会出现通货紧缩现象。但美联储宽松的货币政策，阻止了这种有益的经济衰退的发生。于是人们只能同时面对经济紧缩与通货膨胀两种困境。\n但随着经济逐步回暖，棚屋与基金价格逐渐回升，参议院和那些经济学家们也宣布他们胜利了。人们普遍认为，伯南柯比他的历届前任都更足智多谋。\n现实链接\n遗憾的是，美国人的记性总是很差。过度的借款与支出导致房地产市场出现了投机泡沫，全美经济因此几乎崩溃，而似乎人们转头就忘了这些。到头来，美国人依旧欢迎那些政策以及更多同类政策，还指望它们将我们拉出经济衰退的泥淖。听上去，这样的计划当然比另一个方案（明显不讨好的选择：\n消费不足、拒付债务、更高储蓄）更加容易。这就好比以毒攻毒的解酒方一样，以为宿醉之后最好的醒酒方法便是在清晨再来一口烈酒。但只要有酒鬼，这个借口就一直奏效。其实有时候，宿醉之后最好的解药就是一杯黑咖啡外加几片白吐司面包。\n2008年房市崩溃前夕，美国用巨额借款建设和售卖房屋，而实际上人们并没有那么大的需求。事实证明，这些钱用错了地方。正是由于我们把钱花在了不需要的东西上，所以才没有足够的钱来换取我们真正需要的，比如扩大工业基地。\n政府并没有运用市场的影响力来调整泡沫经济，将其引向健康可行的轨道，成为能够持续有机增长的经济，而是一味使泡沫不断膨胀。经济崩溃后不久，政府借款数目超过了此前私营部门缩减的借款数目。\n第一轮量化宽松政策于2008年年底和2009年实施。当时作为“一次性”计划，购买了大约两万亿美元债券，这些债券以住房抵押贷款和政府支持的机构作为担保。当时，许多“有毒”债券由那些最大的银行和投资基金持有，如果它们被迫在公开市场上倾售债券，其可能蒙受的损失会造成一片恐慌，市场也会随之瘫痪。若此时美联储主动介入，购买一些没人买的债券，市场就会如释重负。\n然而，2010年第一季度，美联储的购买量逐渐减少，股票市场很快抛售一空。这时，有些经济学家开始警告人们将会出现经济“二次衰退”（double dip recession）。同年11月，美联储又一次启动了量化宽松政策，包括更大手笔地购买国债，这一举措使得利率降到了历史最低点。但似乎没有人关心美联储的下一个更大举动——购买最大规模的国债。在经典术语中，这个过程叫作“债务货币化”。通常这一举动被视为一个国家在绝望之时所做的垂死挣扎。但在这一案例中，这个举动不过被视作促进经济复苏的正当手段而已。\n在2011年第二季度和第三季度，当第二次量化宽松政策逐渐停止时，市场又一次出现好转的迹象。之后，美联储推出了“扭曲操作”（Operation Twist），即：将短期债务换作长期债务。这一计划失败后，美联储最终决定继续实施量化宽松政策，每月投入850亿美元，国债与抵押债券基本各占一半。\n尽管长期实施量化宽松政策为股票市场带来诸多益处，也重新造就了房屋市场的繁荣，但这一政策对真正的经济发展却作用甚微。这就是为什么在股票与价格高涨的同时，失业率却始终居高不下，实际收入则陷入停滞。\n美国最终付出的代价将是巨大的。到目前为止，美联储是国债与抵押债券最大的买家。只要这个债主停止购买，两个市场中必有一个会受到严重破坏。这种依赖情形意味着美联储一定不能破产。这也是为什么关于美联储“退出策略”的预测，会让步于手段更为温和的量化宽松“递减”策略。就连那些警告也逐渐温和起来。他们能做的所有事情，就是尽力迷惑市场，使其相信将会有真正的“退出策略”。最终他们的蒙蔽能力也会走到尽头。\n真正的问题在于，当最后关头来临时，美国会有更多的债务要应对。美国的经济对于量化宽松已黔驴技穷，剩下的只有债台高筑的困境。\n今天的经济学家需要看清量化宽松的真正面目：它是延长经济衰退的办法，而不是促进经济复兴的良方。经过多年的失败，他们需要试试新方法。第十九章\n无鱼不起浪\nHOW AN ECONOMY\nGROWS AND\nWHY IT CRASHES\n大洋彼岸，中岛帝国人对美索尼亚国参议员的计划却没有那么热心。工人们听说又要拿出很多真鱼购买鱼邦储备券，社会发生了一些动荡。\n辛辛苦苦地工作，收入却很少，这让大多数中岛帝国人感到沮丧。因为他们的政府不能提供像美索尼亚国那样的社会保障系统，中岛帝国人通常都会存很多钱，这样才不至于无家可归或者老无所依。人人卖力工作，没人家里有驴子（更别说驴车了），而且几乎没人冲浪。即便他们去冲浪，也是四五个人共用一块冲浪板。\n中岛帝国的国王也对现在的安排失去了兴趣，他对奥库达宣布的巨大的消费计划尤为不满。国王的顾问（多数都是阿里·格林芬的学生）开始担心如果中岛帝国停止购买鱼邦储备券，那么本国现有的储备就会贬值。这样一来，美索尼亚人就不会再向他们购买这么多货物了。\n他们声称，如果没有美索尼亚国强劲的需求，中岛帝国的出口企业就会倒闭，继而出现失业、社会不满甚至抗议运动（在中岛帝国，抗议是不被允许的）。国王进退两难，只好维持现状，期盼出现转机。\n一天，国王陷入沉思，他的经济顾问们也外出调研去了，一个普通的农民溜进了王宫，向忧心忡忡的国王进言。\n“陛下，请恕我冒昧，但我听说您正被鱼的问题所困扰。也许我能帮上忙。”\n“这是涉及贸易、储蓄、投资和计划的大问题。你能知道些什么？”国王大发雷霆。\n“我的确所知甚少。”农民让步说，“但是我知道，在我的村子里人们除了木碗一无所有，我们就靠出口木碗为生。我们用木碗换来纸币，存起来养老。我们希望以后能用纸币买些东西，可惜现在已经没什么可买的了。我们出口木碗，但是我们自己却用不上木碗。我们还是把鱼放在地上吃，很不卫生。我们为什么不自己造碗自己用呢，这不是更简单吗？这样一来，我们就可以通过自己的劳动提高自己的生活水平。”\n“荒谬。”国王说，“不出口产品，人民会饿死的。我们还怎么搞经济建设？”\n“陛下，正如我所说的，我们善于做碗。在您的英明领导下，我们现在能捕获很多鱼，我们要做的就是在国内找到愿意用鱼换碗的人。这样一来，我们的产能就能在国内消化掉，人民会有更多的碗、更多的食物。”\n国王有些疑惑不解：“等一下，美索尼亚国比我们富有得多。我们的购买力怎么能比得上他们呢？他们能支付更高的价钱，他们有鱼邦储备券。”\n“陛下，恕我愚昧，但是我看不出来我们为什么需要他们的钞票。没有我们的鱼和碗，那些钞票就没有价值。我们能制造产品，同样也能买得起它们。我们只需要不再把好处白白送人。”\n不知何故，农民简单的话语居然给国王留下了深刻的印象。国王决定改变政策，不再购买鱼邦储备券。从现在开始，中岛帝国人交易时只接受真鱼！\n因为国王不太喜欢农民所提倡的那种迅速转变，他决定逐步转变。\n中岛帝国原本该天天送来的鱼来得越来越慢，情况发生了变化。\n鱼邦储备券最大的买主中岛帝国减少购买量以后，鱼邦储备券供给过剩。供大于求时，价格就会下跌。鱼邦储备券持续贬值，没人愿意继续持有它。小鼓岛和狂舞岛也和中岛帝国一道，限制购买鱼邦储备券。卖主多，买主少，鱼邦储备券掉入了万丈深渊。\n手里攥着大把大把不断贬值的钞票卖不出去，中岛帝国国王认识到事态的发展已经超出了他的掌控。他明白中岛帝国持有的鱼邦储备券很快就会一文不值，他告诫自己的子民咬紧牙关挺过这一关。在一次大会上，他向他们保证短期的痛苦很快就会换来长期的收益。\n不出所料，中岛帝国储备的鱼邦储备券变成了一堆废纸。很多企业倒闭，经济陷入混乱。不过，正如那位农民所预见的那样，其他的企业很快就发展起来，利用闲置的产能制造中岛帝国人真正需要的东西。\n和往常一样，中岛帝国人仍旧捕鱼、制造产品并继续储蓄，由于这些都是促进经济增长的重要因素，因此中岛帝国没有陷入经济危机。实际上，很多产品在国内销售，国人的储蓄也都存在国内的银行里，中岛帝国的生活水平开始稳步提高。当地的工厂利用以前用于购买鱼邦储备券的储蓄购置设备以满足国内需求。为国内消费者生产的产品更多了，中岛帝国的商店里一下子摆满了商品，库存增多导致物价下跌。\n正如那位农民所预料的，虽然损失了大把大把注定贬值的鱼邦储备券，但中岛帝国蓬勃发展起来。\n视线回到美索尼亚国，事态的发展方向恰恰相反。目前只有很小型的捕鱼器还能用，银行的技师工作起来比以前更加拼命也更加有创意。官鱼的尺寸严重缩水，通鱼膨胀也卷土重来。\n很快，官鱼就小得需要把50条或者100条捆成一捆。岛民每天需要吃200条鱼才能充饥。任何鱼邦储备券形式的存款都变得几乎一文不值。这就是所谓的恶性通鱼膨胀。\n由于进口的中岛帝国产品越来越少，美索尼亚国零售商的库存都在减少。钞票贬值，商品稀缺，物价飞涨。\n在一场混乱的公众宣传运动中，参议员们指责零售商“哄抬物价”。他们宣称，只要贪婪的商人同意由政府掌控产品和服务的价格，通鱼膨胀就会结束。但是，这些措施治标不治本，反而弄巧成拙。政府仅仅限制产品的售价，而且任由货币贬值，使得厂家和零售商都无利可图。因此，它们停止了交易，一个黑市产生了，那里的售价比法律规定的要高。\n岛上居民感觉到鱼邦储备券出了问题，纷纷把剩下的积蓄存入海外银行保值，以免受参议院的剥削。\n但是，参议员们注意到了这个趋势，制定法律禁止向海外转移存款。\n所有人都害怕鱼缩水，因此根本没有人长期把鱼存在银行里。鱼捕上来，马上就被吃掉。就和经济发展之前一样，岛上没了储蓄，没了信贷，也没了投资。\n参议员们也没想出什么好主意，他们又故技重施——研究起了下一个刺激计划。显然，以前刺激经济的举措都太微不足道了，下一轮刺激计划一定要更加庞大！然而，没人清楚用什么刺激经济。正当他们情绪低落时，远方出现了中岛帝国的货船，大家的心情一下子好了起来。\n参议员们高兴坏了。他们向岛民保证说，中岛帝国人一定是认识到了自己的错误，后悔放弃了鱼邦储备券。现在，他们会再次把钱存入鱼邦储备银行。\n然而，中岛帝国的货船靠岸后，发生的情况恰恰相反。\n中岛帝国代表分头行动，推着满载着真鱼和鱼邦储备券的独轮手推车，分散到美索尼亚国的各个角落。他们见到东西就买下来，甚至是那些已经订购出去的货物。因为美索尼亚国已经没人拥有真鱼了，所以中岛帝国人的购买力比任何美索尼亚人都要强。\n他们买下并分解了自来水系统设备，装到货船上。对于灯塔，他们也如法炮制。他们买走了所有的驴车、冲浪板、渔网、二手小鼓，甚至连巨型捕鱼器也没有放过。此外，他们还将闲置的公寓抢购一空，这样一来，中岛帝国的工人就拥有自己的度假棚屋了。\n中岛帝国人进行一番疯狂购物之后就离开了，他们带走了所有值钱的东西，留下了他们积攒多年的鱼邦储备券。至少，这回美索尼亚人生火做饭有柴火烧了，不过能不能找到东西吃就是另一回事了。\n参议员们研究了这个灾难性的结果，他们不明白究竟是哪里出了问题。他们促进了消费，可是为什么经济就是不增长呢？最后他们明白了。其实问题比他们想象的要简单得多。\n面对急于知道答案的人们，奥库达说出了一个政治家所能想到的最真诚的话：“还有谁知道怎么制作渔网吗？我想我们应该自己捕鱼了。”\n现实链接\n纵观历史，政府总是因为入不敷出而陷入困境。一旦这个差距扩大到一定程度，政府就要面临艰难的选择。\n选项一，政府通过提高税收增加收入。这条路从来不受人民的欢迎，在一个民主国家中很难通过。即便在集权主义国家（那里没有烦人的选举），增加税收也会带来很多问题。高税率总是会抑制生产，降低经济活力。税率是有上限的。税率过高，人们就会停止工作。如果继续提高，就有可能发生暴乱。\n削减政府支出这个选项要好得多。然而，这样做往往比提高税收更困难。利益受损的人可能会投反对票，或者到街上闹事，那些认为自己理应获得利益的人尤为明显。政客们为了赢得选举做出无数承诺，而选民们也从来不考虑纳税人能否为这些承诺埋单。\n为了避免这两种在政治上不受欢迎的选择，一些政府选择拒绝还债。也就是直接告诉债权人，我们不能全额偿还。如果债权人都是外国人，这就是个很容易做出的选择。从政治上来说，与其增加税收并剥夺国人的利益，还不如失信于外国人。\n对于政治领袖来说，拒不还债当然令人难堪，因为这相当于正式承认自己没有偿付能力。为了避免这一窘境，很多政客索性选择印刷钞票，引起通货膨胀，使债务贬值，等于换一种方式偿还债务。通货膨胀一向是最容易做出的选择，通常也是最后的选择。然而，选择这一方案虽然开始时好像很容易，最终却要付出最惨痛的代价。\n政府可以利用通货膨胀避免艰难的抉择，还可以神不知鬼不觉地赖掉债务。政府可以通过加印钞票在名义上偿还债务，但是这样做的代价是本国货币的贬值。债权人收回了债务，可是却不值多少钱，如果碰上恶性通货膨胀，则会血本无归。\n通货膨胀不过是把财富从以某种货币储蓄的人手中转移到以同种货币负债的人那里。如果遇到恶性通货膨胀，存款就会变得一文不值，负债却一笔勾销。（拥有固定资产的人情况会好一些，因为与以货币形式储蓄不同，固定资产的账面价值会暴涨。）这样的事情以前发生过不止一次：18世纪90年代的法国，19世纪60年代的美国南部邦联，20世纪20年代的德国，20世纪40年代的匈牙利，20世纪七八十年代的阿根廷和巴西以及现在的津巴布韦。在所有的这些例子中，引发恶性通货膨胀以及随后的经济灾难的原因都惊人地相似。这些国家都是通过降低货币价值偿还巨额外债，结果，本国的人民陷入了赤贫之中。\n现在的美国如果发生恶性通货膨胀，它必将成为有史以来“获此殊荣”的最大最发达的经济体。但是，这并不意味着这种情况不会发生。到目前为止，美元的储备货币地位一直是美国手中的王牌。也就是说，哪怕基本面再差，世界各国还是会接受美元。然而，一旦失去储备货币地位，美元的下场就会和其他已经崩溃的货币一样。\n美国必须正视这些可能性，并在能够掌控自己的命运之前，及时悬崖勒马。后记\n故事中，美索尼亚国的结局惨淡，但美国这个超级大国却未必是同样的命运。不幸的是，美国的领导人依旧推行消费计划，而且数额更加庞大，实际上正是类似的政策引起了金融危机。他们越是执迷不悟，最后的结局就越悲惨。\n虽然用政府经济刺激计划应对资本主义的失败这一想法是凯恩斯首创的，但是直到艾伦·格林斯潘、乔治·布什、本·伯南克和巴拉克·奥巴马登上历史舞台以后，这一思想才开始成为体系。2002年以前，我们从未见过如此庞大的联邦赤字（现在每年都超过1.5万亿美元），如此大规模地实行超低利率和操控信贷市场也是前所未有的。\n虽然错误如此明显，但美国还是一错再错。\n早在2002年，也就是充斥着大量不当投资的互联网经济时期，数百亿美元的资金涌入了毫无前途的公司，那时经济本来应该进入一个长期的衰退时期。但是新当选的乔治·布什不希望糟糕的经济环境影响他连任。所以，他和顾问们选择了凯恩斯主义的解决办法，政府支出和宽松信贷都达到了前所未有的规模。\n因此，2002\\~2003年的这场经济危机是历史上最轻微的一次。但是，它的代价却是长期的沉重负担。这场危机结束时，美国经济失衡的现象比以前严重得多。按理说，这种情况本来不该出现。\n我们期待实实在在的经济增长，结果却吹起了一个更大的资产泡沫（房市泡沫），只是暂时缓解了互联网泡沫破裂后的压力。不断上涨的房价带来了很多“好处”，于是人们就误以为那是经济健康的明证。但是，正如我们所看到的，所谓的强劲势头不过是海市蜃楼。\n6年后，下一次危机发生了，但美国仍然没能从这些错误中学到任何东西，这才是真正的悲剧。政客和经济学家们不仅误判了2008年经济危机的起因，还开出了错误的药方，这些错误是很危险的。\n金融危机发生数月以来，大家一致认为是因为缺乏足够的监管才会酿成苦果，在很大程度上忽视了政府和美联储的责任。结果，不该来的（财政支出和限制性规定）越来越多，该来的（储蓄和自由企业）越来越少。\n华尔街的领袖们也很不负责任。大银行在经济繁荣的那几年赚取了惊人的利润，危机来临之后，它们本应该付出更大的代价。但是银行家的这些手段都是政府授意的。美国的领导人很不理智地鼓励购房，抑制储蓄，还很不理智地鼓励借贷。这些因素共同作用，破坏了市场。\n美联储、联邦住房管理局、房利美、房地美（它们一直都是伪装下的政府机构）以及其他一些机构制定了许多政策。这些政策有利于房屋买卖，消除了制约信贷发放的因素。其结果就是形成了一个信贷和房地产泡沫，一个在破裂之前只能继续膨胀的泡沫。\n人为造成的低利率（使经济显得很健康）激活了可调利率的按揭贷款市场，还催生了诱惑利率。诱惑利率使原本高不可攀的房子显得唾手可得。艾伦·格林斯潘本人也积极鼓励购房者参与进来。政府机构和政府资助的机构仅仅根据借款人偿付诱惑利率的能力就为其担保，从而进一步加剧了问题。没有它们的担保，大部分按揭贷款银行都不会提供贷款。\n正如自由市场中的物价是由供求关系决定的，金融市场和房地产市场是由贪欲和担忧这一组对立的情感所支配的。然而，美国政府竭尽所能试图将担忧从这一等式中抹去。\n因此，在2008年年初市场的力量正要戳破信贷和房产泡沫的时候，美国政府插手进来继续吹大这两个泡沫。美国政府先是援助贝尔斯登和美国国际集团，并为高盛和美国银行等华尔街公司担保。然后美国财政部推出了价值7 000亿美元的问题资产救助计划，购买私营部门不愿投入的住房抵押贷款资产。后来，美国政府又救助了为学生提供贷款的沙利美，并基本上接手了整个助学贷款市场。紧接着又救助了底特律的汽车生产商。\n本应倒闭的公司又在政府的支持下站了起来，本应解放出来的资金和劳动力被困在了无效的经济活动中，无法发挥更高的经济效益。\n房市泡沫破裂以后，消费者无法再那么轻松地赚钱，于是理智地停止了消费。作为应对，美国政府推出了7 000亿美元的巨额刺激计划。美国政府的这笔开销，是向美国民众的后代借来的。靠着这笔钱，现在的美国人不用去过量入为出的拮据生活。\n美国政府拒绝顺应市场的力量，不允许严格控制过度消费，不允许错误投资变现，不允许补充已经枯竭了的储蓄，不允许为资本投资提供资金，不允许帮助工人从服务业转移到制造业。如此一来，美国政府实际上是拒绝了良药，加重了病情。在此过程中，美国把各种各样的债务都转化成了政府债务，并且吹起了另一个泡沫，这次的主角是美国国债。\n一旦这一药方没能使经济成功复苏，美联储便立刻调制出药效更强的药汤，那就是量化宽松。第一套方案（QE1）推出后，紧跟着便是第二套方案（QE2）、“扭曲操作”以及第三套方案（QE3），其中第三套方案就是当时人们所知的“无限量化宽松”政策。也就是说，如果一开始你没有成功，就原样重复一遍。如果还是不管用那就再做一遍，只不过动作幅度更大。如果你觉得这种描述让你感觉神经错乱，我想说，你的感觉没错！\n不幸的是，这个新泡沫可能会比以往的资产泡沫都要大。这个泡沫终将破裂，必将引起物价和利率飞涨，其破坏力会比互联网泡沫和房地产泡沫加起来的威力还要大。\n现在悬崖勒马还为时不晚。美国需要能勇敢地向选民坦白的领导人，也需要能够为经济复兴付出辛劳的选民。\n多年以来，美国人一直入不敷出，现在他们必须下决心过量入为出的生活。如果能够做到这一点，并任由自由市场的力量发挥作用，他们就能重新平衡经济，为实实在在的发展打下基础。\n然而，如果他们选择寄希望于借贷、印钞机以及政府承诺的毫无痛苦的解决办法，那他们都要回到徒手捕鱼的状态。致谢\n本书的寓言模型借自《经济增长模式与停滞的原因》一书。该书出版于1985年，作者欧文·A·希夫慷慨地把书中的理念传给了他的儿子们。\n作者还要感谢布伦丹·利奇。他为本书创作了插图，迅速而富有创意，从视觉层面展现了我们的幽默感与我们对经济的看法。我们还要感谢欧洲太平洋资本公司（Euro

But if anything held that possibility, it might have been the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Beyond its immediate consequences for abortion access, the ruling also carried the potential to shift the focus of the midterms away from the economic issues that have dominated the early days of the campaign.\n\nIn the weeks since the Supreme Court's ruling, we've seen a first wave of polling trying to gauge where voters' priorities now lie, and what that might mean for the upcoming elections. Early results suggest that concerns about abortion and women's rights have surged, with Democrats' attention particularly drawn to the issue. At the same time, they find the majority of voters' focus has so far remained elsewhere.\n\nWhat voters care about, and how those priorities influence their decisions, is too complicated to be fully captured in a single poll question. The degree to which voters personally care about an issue is different from the question of whether that issue will be decisive in an election, either by motivating someone to vote when they wouldn't have otherwise, or by convincing them to vote for a different candidate than they would have otherwise.

Responses to this question also frequently reflect which issues campaigns are choosing to prioritize, and the extent to which those efforts are resonating with the public.\n\n**What it says on abortion:** An [AP-NORC poll](https://apnorc.org/projects/in-the-wake-of-the-dobbs-ruling-more-americans-are-citing-abortion-or-womens-rights-as-priority-issues/), conducted the week of the Supreme Court ruling, managed to capture the immediate effects of the decision: 43% of the interviews were conducted prior to the ruling, and the remainder afterward. Among those polled pre-decision, 13% named abortion or women's rights issues as among the top five problems they wanted to see the government work on -- already an elevated number compared with much of the past decade. Among those surveyed after the Court's ruling, the number naming abortion or women's rights climbed to 30%. The overturning of Roe also instantly widened the partisan intensity gap on the issue, the AP-NORC poll found. Prior to the decision, Democrats were 9 percentage points likelier than Republicans to list abortion or women's rights as a top issue (18% vs. 9%). In the days following, that gap rose to 28 points (42% vs. 14%).", "timestamp": 1658036050, "digest": "4ydfndJKagxqCUNGzvc2_N7nJKJMbFRxOHEKVNbjPJE", "contributor": "0x30d7D6788DF2a8Eb0cFF3050A5FF9046a415EE4B"}

The partisan balance on this question has reversed, as well. Two years ago, Republicans were 15 points likelier than Democrats, 32% to 17%, to say they considered abortion an electoral litmus test. In the most recent poll, by contrast, the Democrats were 12 points more likely than Republicans, 43% to 31%, to say so.\n\nIt's worth taking a closer look at which Republicans and Democrats now consider abortion a pivotal issue. In data provided by PRRI, the share of Americans viewing abortion as a litmus test was highest among those whose views were aligned with their party: 46% of Democrats who generally favor legal abortion and 39% among Republicans who generally oppose it, compared with just 16% among the Republican supporters of abortion rights. (There are too few anti-abortion Democrats to examine those numbers separately in the survey.) Among political independents, similar shares of abortion rights supporters (26%) and opponents (23%) say they'd only vote for a candidate who shared their views on the issue.\n\n**THE QUESTION:** Relative likelihood of voting (for instance \"Does the news about this issue make you more or less likely to vote in the upcoming election?\")", "timestamp": 1658036187, "digest": "hOVO1gu0byi3tuWUR66ifoHZX6IkPms8w-r27VNQR9c", "contributor": "0x34d8285F02Df073b2fE8629ceB1C46Bd26779916"}

For one thing, increased ideological cohesion among both [politicians](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/) and [ordinary Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) mean that most voters' views on a given topic are often likely to match up with the party they'd be voting for anyway.", "timestamp": 1658036153, "digest": "lrLULvrDPjkM7Wf0td8GDVLmblSDWs6QlAvlKX2BJFo", "contributor": "0x6FFb99DecB6D35bCE9fbdb7a27ecc34d61C0461A"}

To answer it literally, respondents would have to work through a series of complicated mental math: remembering how likely they'd previously thought they were to vote, considering the impact of the news on their motivation level, and calculating the relative difference (\"before, there was only a 76% chance that I'd vote, but now it's 83% at least!\")\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, then, people *[don't](https://csap.yale.edu/news/alex-coppock-and-matt-graham-publish-research-measuring-attitude-change)*[ tend to answer it literally](https://csap.yale.edu/news/alex-coppock-and-matt-graham-publish-research-measuring-attitude-change).

{"id": "KdDcmdKQf-xu1k8-A--jsZC6dtmPm0lh8Qr2RPNCSEI", "title": "盘点周杰伦的NFT之路  NFT如何借明星之力破圈", "body": "受周董影响而追随入局“杰伦熊”NFT 的藏友们在这一波大跌中，几乎都被稳稳“套牢”。对于买了 Phanta Bear NFT 并且还持有在手上的玩家们来说，就一个字“亏”。\n\n7 月 6 日中午 12 点，周杰伦在时隔六年后重磅推出的新专辑《最伟大的作品》先行曲 MV 正式首播，几分钟内，有关周董即将发行新专辑的消息也在瞬息间“刷爆”了大家的朋友圈和多个平台首页。在 MV 视频上线的短短 3 个小时内，播放量已经破亿，创造了音乐平台 MV 最快破亿播放记录。\n\n7 月 14 日晚上九点，周杰伦《最伟大的作品》正式重磅上线各大音乐平台，一时之间大“杀”四方，霸榜多家音乐平台首页。“方文山把最好的词给了周杰伦”、“周杰伦新专辑销售额破亿”、“红颜如霜太好听了”等相关词条在微博热搜榜上整整悬挂了一夜。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/fbfd6e7b6e88b9c8e25dfae030398eeb.jpg)\n\n周杰伦不愧是周杰伦，周董的影响力果然毋庸置疑，不减当年，在音乐市场中，杰伦出走六载，归来仍是华语乐坛天王顶流。\n\n然而，在 NFT 市场上，杰伦的影响力却没有发挥出其应有的“大力奇效”，由周杰伦站台的 Phanta Bear NFT 系列（“幻影熊”）接连遭遇暴跌，其价格已经从今年 1 月 11 日所达的最高点 8.8 ETH 跳水至近期的 0.66 ETH，价格缩水率接近 98%，简直是“雷霆暴击”。\n\n因而，受周董影响而追随入局“杰伦熊”NFT 的藏友们在这一波大跌中，几乎都被稳稳“套牢”。不论是在今年 1 月 1 日发行时以发行价 0.26 ETH 买入，还是在价格高点 8.8 ETH 时高位接盘，对于买了 Phanta Bear NFT 并且还持有在手上的玩家们来说，就一个字“亏”。似乎哪怕是周杰伦，在 NFT 领域也不能成为用户们百分百的“价格定心丸”。\n\n明星流量加持 NFT 成了虚幻泡影？娱乐圈联动 NFT 也成了一场“闹剧”？\n\n实质上，明星流量成为了 NFT 的一项重要流量池所在，娱乐圈联动 NFT 也成为了娱乐业和 NFT 业的双向发展动能，为两个圈子的融合突破提供了更加广阔的通道。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/ff436e6ec75a43a9f2f1d3e74086ba33.jpg)\n\n在周董新专辑《最伟大的作品》推出后，Azuki 官方在社交媒体上发文表示，Azuki 联合创始人以周杰伦新专辑《最伟大的作品》为涉及灵感为周杰伦推出了定制款 Azuki NFT 作品。Web3.0 音乐元宇宙平台 Muverse 推出的 YOLO Bunny NFT 盲盒开启白名单铸造，首批 Private-Mint 将包含部分致敬周杰伦《最伟大的作品》NFT。可见，周董的商业价值在 NFT 圈里还是毋庸置疑。当然，NFT 频频蹭上娱乐圈的热度，这也是急需实现“破圈”的 NFT 的一条最方便的路。\n\n## 周杰伦布局 NFT：纵览周董的 NFT 商业盘\n\n很多人都在好奇，周杰伦消失在乐坛的六年，杰伦在哪里？杰伦都在干什么？\n\n事实上，在周杰伦抱着孩子“嘤嘤嘤”，捧着奶茶“吨吨吨”的同时，周杰伦还在积极指点他的 NFT 江山，布局他的 NFT 大盘。周杰伦是国内最早一批进入“NFT 游戏场”的明星玩家之一，并且他也是公认的玩 NFT 玩得比较专业的明星，在大大小小明星入局 NFT 盘点中，周杰伦三个字一定会出现在名单前头。\n\n去年 12 月 31 日，周杰伦与昆凌夫妇分别在社交平台中晒出了 Phanta Bear 的 NFT 形象，周杰伦表示这是“哥收到的第一个特别礼物”。今年 1 月 3 日，周杰伦将 Instagram 头像换为 Phanta Bear 的 NFT 作品，并表示“换几个月头像，感受元宇宙的感觉”。有了周杰伦的宣传，Phanta Bear 的 NFT 作品影响力日扩千里，1 月 1 日发行当天，不到一小时的时间，10000 个 Phanta Bear 的 NFT 作品“全部清空”。\n\nPhanta Bear 的 NFT 作品是由元宇宙平台 Ezek 联合周杰伦名下潮牌 PHANTACi 推出的，它和周杰伦的关系可以说是一根蛛丝线，显而不明。周杰伦在社交平台上利用自身强大的粉丝基础和社交媒体影响力为它站台，但它实际上却不是周杰伦本人所推出的自己的 NFT 作品，因而在发行 Phanta Bear 的 NFT 作品的过程中，周杰伦给自己的定位是一位喜爱者、收藏家。\n\n而空降 NFT 市场的 Phanta Bear 的 NFT 作品就像是一个和 BOSS 有七拐八绕的亲戚关系的“关系户”，而“关系户”的那层说不清道不明的关系成功为它结成了“保护网”，因此它被众人捧起来了，“幻影熊”也有了新名字——“杰伦熊”。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/fc227dd4345814d14d8f09c5b6f4ec43.jpg)\n\n周杰伦在社交媒体平台上为“杰伦熊”站台宣传，可以被看作只是他在 NFT 领域的浅试一下，接下来，周杰伦的一系列在 NFT 领域的动作都暗示着周董在 NFT 市场上的“野心”，他不仅仅要做个收藏家。在自己玩 NFT 的同时，周杰伦还带动周边好友一起玩起了 NFT，陈冠希、方文山、阿信、林俊杰，周杰伦以一人之力撬动了整个明星 NFT 圈，引起了明星 NFT 风暴。\n\n今年 1 月底，周杰伦在“薄盒 Mints”上首次合作拍卖了从未公开的经典歌曲 Demo 音乐数字藏品。将周董的音乐作品和 NFT 结合起来，不仅更改了其音乐作品的留存形式，使得周董的音乐可以在传播扩散的广度和深度上都得到提升，而且通过音乐赋能 NFT，NFT 的价值也获得了进一步的显现，NFT 作品从 JPG 的局限中走出，收藏意义也大为增加。\n\n4 月 1 日，周杰伦在 Instagram 上发文，称被电话告知黄立成之前送给自己的 BAYC #3738 NFT（“无聊猿”NFT）被钓鱼网站所盗。愚人节的这一则消息，将周杰伦和“无聊猿”NFT 重新炸回大众视野，也就是这件事让大众了解到了周董在没发歌的日子里还在做些什么——玩 NFT。同时，也是此事件让大家在初步了解到独一无二、不可篡改的 NFT 作品仍然面临着被盗风险，哪怕他是周杰伦，哪怕那天恰好是愚人节，周杰伦价值百万的“无聊猿”NFT 被盗仍然成为了当月行业动荡大事件。\n\n6 月份，他和知名足球俱乐部巴黎圣日耳曼展开了合作，为了庆祝巴黎圣日尔曼的第 10 座法甲冠军奖杯，他们联合推出了一套名为“Tiger Champs”的 NFT。7 月 4 日，周杰伦与名厨江振诚联合推出 NFT 独家甜点“Afro Bear 爆炸熊”，该甜点将在 FineDayClub 举办的一场米其林元宇宙活动中推出。可见，在准备新专辑《最伟大的作品》的同时，周董也没有放弃他的 NFT 事业。\n\n几乎在每一个月里，周董在 NFT 领域发展上都有新的突破，周杰伦的 NFT 事业线越走越清晰。唱歌、弹琴、魔术、演戏、拍电影、双截棍、NFT……周杰伦始终在不停的尝试新的领域，并且在新的领域里，周董总是能将兴趣做成专业。因此在周杰伦新专辑《最伟大的作品》发布后，尤其是《最伟大的作品》还是发行的数字专辑版本后，大家都在疯狂刷频期待着周董新专辑的 NFT 版本发布。\n\n## 明星入局 NFT：NFT 领域如何借明星之力形成“破圈效应”？\n\n周董卷动了华语圈的明星 NFT 风暴，而除了周杰伦和他的朋友们，华语明星里进入 NFT 圈的还有汪峰、伊能静、余文乐、徐静蕾、潘玮柏、胡彦斌、修杰楷、小马及小刀等众多明星艺人。在国外的明星 NFT 圈里，也不乏大咖顶流，汤姆・布雷迪、大坂直美、莱昂内尔・梅西、勒布朗・詹姆斯、麦当娜……\n\n明星的加盟，也让 NFT 这个圈子有了更多 New Money 的入场。\n\n自带庞大粉丝流量池的明星们在进入 NFT 圈之后，闻风而动的粉丝、歌迷、收藏家迅速抢占坑位，也随之加入 NFT 圈，买 NFT、炒 NFT，他们大多是既是粉丝，也是投机者，因而他们也有一个新名字“粉牛”。\n\n买明星站台或者发行的 NFT 作品，一方面是追星的投机行为，另一方面拥有明星同款系列 NFT，对于他们来说也是身份的象征、炫耀的资本，仿佛拥有了明星同款系列 NFT，他们也就仿佛和明星踏入了同一个圈层。明星们的影响力实在是不容小觑，尤其是对于周杰伦这样“路人盘”也相当大的顶流巨星来说，他们在 NFT 领域的一举一动实质上都在刺激着粉丝、收藏家的敏感神经。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/958f288ac95aacda0e193701711a64ce.jpg)\n\n当然，也有很多明星追随者也在幻想着是否有一天他们也可以凭借着手中的明星 NFT 抢占演唱会的前台，毕竟加入拥有周杰伦的 NFT 就能够有机会获得周杰伦演唱会的门票的机会，谁会不心动呢？怪不得在周杰伦出新专辑《最伟大的作品》的时候，也不乏有小伙伴在各大平台下留言“ball ball 杰伦也出个《最伟大的作品》NFT 吧”。\n\n同样如果以 NFT 的形式发行音乐唱片作品，在传播上不仅更方便，对于明星们的铁粉们来说，音乐作品在永久保存和长期流传上也变得更加方便了。另外，NFT 还以门票、明星海报、球星卡等具备一定收藏价值的载体在传播，名人明星亲自带货，也成为了将 NFT 直接推向普通大众群体的重要手段之一。\n\n对于 NFT 圈来说，有了明星们以及他们所自带的粉丝流量群体的加入，NFT 想要“破圈”也变得容易了起来。明星总是与潮流相连接，追星族总是与年轻、接受度强等词语相匹配，而这刚好也是 NFT 受众群体的特性，所以明星 NFT 在 NFT 圈具有先天优势。明星 NFT 在作品呈现、发行形式、传播群体上都有着更为广泛的助力优势。\n\n但是也是由于是明星发行或站台的 NFT 作品，明星在 NFT 圈不容易做到百分百专注，更多的是“玩票性质”，代为运营管理的往往是他们的经纪公司，所以导致了明星 NFT 在发行后缺乏后续运营维护，用户流失量也相当迅速。\n\n同样也因为缺少专业的赋能机制，而让他们的 NFT 除了收藏、炒作以外，似乎别无他用，明星 NFT 的价值也犹如坐上过山车，当明星热度加持一过，明星 NFT 也很容易沦入谷底。如果再遇上现在的“熊市打击”，明星 NFT 作品显然没有其他的 NFT 作品在持久稳定上占优势了。\n\n当然，明星 NFT 如果能够绑定更多的福利赋能机制，它们的市场前景还是不容小觑的，毕竟再次重申，没有人能够拒绝比如买了周杰伦相关 NFT 就能直接获得周杰伦演唱会前排门票的福利机会！\n\n## 娱乐圈“NFT 登月计划”：是新领域的联动发展\n\n除了明星进入 NFT 领域，整个娱乐圈行业与 NFT 行业的联动合作也是不少。小说、电影、电视剧都可以制作成 NFT 作品，各大娱乐头部公司纷纷进军元宇宙空间进行 NFT 产业布局。\n\n国内，王家卫的电影《花样年华一刹那》未曝光片段被制作成了电影 NFT 作品，并且在苏富比拍出了 428.4 万元港币的天价。国外，《杀死比尔》的导演昆汀・塔伦蒂诺也将《低俗小说》中 7 个未剪辑的片段制作成电影 NFT 并且放在全球最大的 NFT 交易平台 OpenSea 上进行拍卖。\n\n国内还有不少大热电视剧也正在被制作成数字藏品进行发行，《红旗渠》、《东宫》、《风起陇西》、《且试天下》……影视化数字藏品正在成为常态化。\n\n当然，市场上出现如此多影视作品数字藏品的原因之一，还在于众多娱乐巨头公司的 NFT 计划，国内影视大哥“华策集团”就是早期“吃螃蟹”的人。国人童年记忆《喜羊羊与灰太狼》不仅被其制作公司奥飞娱乐制作成了 NFT，而且还面向海外发行了一版。即使没有影视剧作为作品素材库的艺人经纪公司，比如 SM 娱乐公司、乐华娱乐公司等专做偶像艺人的公司也正在布局 NFT 产业。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/e2582653a6acdf23293572cbac5ce6fd.jpg)\n\n对于整个娱乐产业而言，发行 NFT 更多的在于“顺手的事情”，NFT 最重要的一点在于作品版权，而恰好各大娱乐公司不缺的就是版权，音乐作品、影视作品推行的同时发行 NFT，既是为自己造势，也是为自己圈入更多的流量，获得更大的曝光和收益。\n\n当然，将 NFT 当成事业发展，对于各家娱乐公司是一条相当不错的产业联动之路，特别是在后疫情时代，演唱会停摆，电视剧拍摄剧组风险大，电影院随时面临因疫情而关闭的风险，娱乐业遭受重大影响情况下。娱乐圈与 NFT 产业积极联动，长期持续的发展下去，更像是一条娱乐业的“自救之路”。\n\n虽然，娱乐圈和 NFT 的联动也会让本就浮躁的 NFT 行业变得更加焦灼，但是早已适应“赚快钱”、“抢流量”的娱乐产业能够寻求到一条娱乐产业和 NFT 产业的平衡之路，当热度过去，娱乐 NFT 不再坐上这趟“过山车”，而是越发展越稳定。\n", "timestamp": 1658037200, "digest": "YM6qicxURypajUMoA111_liJ1S_wPWa5KLK5Ipb3ejM", "contributor":

Is that a step in the right direction? Is that something to be celebrated, or is it nothing at all?*\n\n**CAHN:** This is far too little, far too late. Google has been warned that the way they are storing data poses a threat to civil rights for years.\n\nAnd while we are all talking about the threat to abortion care right now, this also poses a threat to political protest, it poses a threat to freedom of religion, freedom of assembly -- almost any right that we use.\n\nIn fact, almost any right that we exercise by coming together in a single place can be forever chilled by these sorts of warrants. And it's not hypothetical. We saw Minneapolis police using a [geofence warrant](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/) during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\n\nEven by its own terms, Google's approach isn't enough. First off, for people who are providing [abortion medication](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/health/medication-abortion-mifepristone-access-wellness/index.html) and services in states where it's illegal, they're not about to publicize to Google that they qualify as a health care facility. So Google wouldn't even know to redact the information from that location.\n\nAnd then second of all, even if they are redacting information from the clinic itself, you can still gain a lot of information by tracking someone's movements in other areas, particularly if people are traveling out of state long distances.\n\nSo rather than saying that we should only have our privacy in select locations, Google should say that every place should be a safe place.", "timestamp": 1658036719, "digest": "HaZeWkqnpRxOZ53s8QNNKUSkuOsbiypEApKTd67YyKE", "contributor": "0x34Fc4baE37Cc5eE6eeEa976C614078421BCe1b01"}

Is that a separate issue, or is that wrapped up into this?*\n\n**CAHN:** Oh, that's all part of a threat modeling here. When we look at the constellation of risks, some of it comes from scraping massive amounts of data from Google, from social media companies and even from Apple. But a large part of it is simply looking at the text messages we send.\n\nWe continue to see people being reported to police by family, by friends, for seeking abortion services. It's quite common in American courtrooms to see emails, text messages, even encrypted messages being read back into the transcript to be used against us.\n\nEncrypting your communications can help reduce the risk, but you know, using the most secure platforms like Signal and also setting up messages to automatically delete is an even more effective safeguard.\n\n### What will spark an abortion investigation?\n\n**WHAT MATTERS:** *From your report, I learned about the importance of non-state actors. You talked about family members informing on people and activists tracking license plates. It's not my impression that in states that ban abortion there will be an abortion police out there actively searching for this. It takes these activist groups to tee it up. Is that right? Or is that a misread?*\n\n**CAHN:** I think that it is both. So I think that's correct today, but I fear that we will see designated abortion policing units in the future. Certainly during Roe, even in its waning days, we saw states relying extensively on private bounty hunters and activists to enforce abortion bans.\n\nFamously in the case of [SB 8 in Texas](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/23/texas-abortion-sb8-lawsuits/), the state turned to private companies, because it was unconstitutional under Roe for them to engage in that sort of anti-abortion policing themselves.\n\nBut it's unclear in a world where the police can prosecute those seeking care directly whether we'll see less of a focus on those private bounty hunters and private activist groups.", "timestamp": 1658036681, "digest": "qwyQ2xSlf-Bbj-rNrAw4WfRyxg3DquGLeuwBFC2XsFE", "contributor": "0x01958Aa408fF3CA51f11ff160F627c9c17E2E57E"}

なにから始めたらいいのか\n\nNFTの相場全体としては厳しい相場だった中で力強い動きが目立っている [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) なかなか仕組みとか入り口が分かりにくい（自分もそうでした）と思うので、もっといろんな人が興味を持ったらいいなという思いで紹介をしてみようと思います。記事の内容はNFAであり売買をするときはDYORでよろしくお願いします\n\n言いたいことがいっぱいあるのですごい長くなる予感がしますが、それでは始めてみます\n\n# Art Blocksとは\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8bUcwFzTtqlZOglaPFar.png?height=217&width=811)\n\nArt Blocksとはなにかについてまずは[公式のサイト](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)にある創業者のSnowfro（Chromie Squiggleの作者）の言葉で始めてみます\n\n> Art Blocksは、イーサリアム・ブロックチェーン上に不変に保存される、プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツに焦点を当てた、これまでにないタイプのプラットフォームです。\n>\n> 好きなコレクションを選び、作品の代金を支払うと、アルゴリズムによってランダムに生成されたバージョンのコンテンツが作成され、あなたのイーサリアムアカウントに送られます。出来上がった作品は、静止画像であったり、3Dモデルであったり、インタラクティブな体験であったりします。出力はそれぞれ異なり、プラットフォーム上で作成できるコンテンツの種類には無限の可能性があります。\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/learn](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)\n\nアーティストはコレクションを生み出すコードを登録し、購入者がサイトからmintをするとトランザクションごとに、コードに組み込まれたランダムな要素が組み合わさって一定の共通のスタイルであるけれどもそれぞれが異なる作品を生み出すプラットフォームがArt Blocksです。すでに存在している作品から選ぶのではなくmintに参加することでコレクターが作品を生み出す体験ができることが魅力の1つだと思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートに興味がない、NFT ARTに興味がない人でもArt Blocksのことはなんとなく聞いたことがある（からこの記事を読んでいると思いますが）人はそれなりにいると思います。それはArt BlocksがすでにNFTの1つのジャンルを代表するブランドになっているからだと思います。\n\n今後NFTの世界がより広がり多くの新しい人たちが入ってきたときにもアートの入り口として存在しているなら、人々をひきつける作品を継続的に生み出すプラットフォームとしてNFTの世界でのアートのカテゴリでのブランドであり続けているかもしれないと思います。\n\nArt Blocksの魅力、可能性についてZenecaが熱く語っている記事が2つ、またCoincheck NFTでArt Blocksを購入できるので、Coincheckの紹介記事も分かりやすいのでので合わせてどうぞ\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks)\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2)\n\n[https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494](https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494)\n\n# Generative Artとは\n\nArt Blocksの紹介の中に出てきた「プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツ」＝**ジェネラティブアート**にそもそもなんで高い値段がつくのか分からない、という人も多いと思います（自分もそうでした）\n\nジェネラティブアートがなにかについては入門記事として必ず名前が出る「ジェネラティブアートを愛する理由」という記事が素晴らしいので、Art Blocksに興味があれば時間のある時にぜひ読んでみてほしいです。\n\n[https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/](https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/)\n\nいくつか自分が記事を読んでなるほどなー、と思ってジェネラティブアートは良いぞ！と思うに至ったポイントなどを引用を交えつつ簡単にまとめてみます。\n\n### ジェネラティブ・アートは20世紀美術の中心的テーマの拡張\n\n> 幾何学的、抽象化、偶然性は、ジェネラティブ・アートに限らず、20世紀のあらゆるアートにとって主要なテーマです。以下のような主題がこれらはコンピューターを使っていない20世紀初頭の作品から強く感じることが出来て、ジェネラティブアートとつながっていることを強く感じることが出来ます。\n\n* 分析的キュビスムにおける幾何学の破壊\n* 未来派、構成主義、バウハウスにはじまるテクノロジー重視、マシン美学、機械化された生産\n* ダダ、シュルレアリスム、抽象表現主義における自律と偶然の導入\n* 新造形主義、シュプレマティスム、ハード・エッジ、オプ・アートの非比喩的美学、力強い幾何学、鮮明な色使い\n* ソル・ルウィットらによるアルゴリズムの使用\n\n![左から、Circles in a Circle – Wassily Kandinsky, 1923、Highway and Byways – Paul Klee, 1928、Suprematist Composition – Kasimir Malevich, 1916　今のジェネラティブアートに通じるものを強く感じます](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQJNTIr4szr7UXa0L-yvQ.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\n> ジェネラティブアートは\n>\n> **「ジェネラティブアートとは、コンピュータを使い、創造のプロセスの一部に意図的に偶然性を取り入れたプログラムで作られたアートのことである。」**\n>\n> と定義されますが、2つの間違った見方をよくされることがあります。\n\n> ### よくある誤解・その1\n>\n> アーティストは創作のプロセス全体を完全に制御していて、プログラムは常に書かれた通りに実行されるだけである。それゆえジェネラティブアートは、たとえ人間的で親しみやすいものだったとしても、偶然性、偶発性、発見性、自発性を欠いている。\n>\n> ### よくある誤解・その2\n>\n> アーティストはまったく制御することなく、自律的なマシンがランダムにデザインを生成しているだけである。コンピュータがアートを作っていて、人間は制作者には値しない。本当のアートとはいえないのだから。\n\n実際にはジェネラティブアートは作品に導入する偶然性を丁寧にコントロールされています。秩序の中の偶然性、と聞くと自分は人の手が入らないあらゆる自然の中にあるものを思い浮かべます。受け取り方は人それぞれだと思いますがジェネラティブアートを見ていて時々はっとした気持ちになって心を奪われるのはそういう側面もあるのかな、と思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートは現代のアートの一つの形であり、NFT、Cryptoの外の世界にも存在するものなので、NFT外のアートに関心がある人たちにとっては特殊なものではなく受け入れやすいアートの形式なのかもしれません。\n\n# Art Blocksの仕組み\n\nだいぶ話が飛躍しましたがArt Blocksの紹介に戻ります。\n\n![左からFidenza、Ringers、Archetype](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TdQfBj9BkM47n1SZ5VVYq.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\nArt

Curatedに選ばれたことがあるアーティストが実験的であったり、自由度の高い作品を出すことが出来る場\n* 実績のあるアーティストの作品になるのでフロアが高くなることもある\n\nフロアを市場の評価とするならばCuratedが最も人気が出やすいです。\n\n### 販売方法\n\n* Art Blocksの作品はダッチオークションで販売されることが多いです\n  * Factoryの作品には固定のmint価格のものも時々あります\n* 作品の人気や市場の状況によりますが、評価が定まっていない状態で販売されることも多いので結果的に、セカンダリに対して割安な価格でmintできることがあります\n* リリースが予定されている作品はArt Blocksの公式サイトの”upcoming project releases”やDiscrodで紹介されているので定期的に見てお気に入りのプロジェクトがあったらmintの日程をカレンダーに登録すると良いと思います\n  * mintは日本時間の深夜（AM2時ぐらいとか）が多いです\n\n👇はArt Blocks公式のYouTubeチャンネルにあるHow to Mintの動画です\n\n[https://youtu.be/wczbsScyEdo](https://youtu.be/wczbsScyEdo)\n\n# なにから始めたらいいのか\n\n### セカンダリ（OpenSeaなど）で購入する\n\nすでにmintが終わった作品はOpenSeaで販売されているので、いろんな作品を見てその中からお気に入りの作品が見つかって購入してもよい、と思えたらセカンダリで購入するところから始めても良いと思います\n\n* [Art Blocks

mintに参加する\n\n公式サイトなどからmint予定の作品を定期的にチェックしてお気に入りのコレクションがあったらぜひmintに参加してみてください。ダッチオークションを見守りながら自分の作品がmintして生み出された作品が届くときはとても楽しい体験です！\n\nまた、まだmintが終わっていないコレクションもいくつか公式サイトで紹介されています。(“projects open to mint”となっています)その中から気になる作品があればmintしてみるのもいいかもしれません\n\n# おわりに\n\n長々と書いてきたのでここまで読んでくれている人がどれだけいるか分かりませんが最後に\n\n自分が購入した作品の価値が上がってフロアが上がるのが一番嬉しいし、そういう側面は大いにあるので「儲ける」ためにArt Blocksを購入することもぜんぜんありだと思いますが、Art Blocksはいわゆる「NFT ART」に属するので盛り上がっている時期はそれなりに取引がありますが、PFPなど他のジャンルが盛り上がっている時期には、多くの人の関心が無くなってほとんど取引が無くなるようなこともあります。なので短期（1か月以内）で利益を出すことを目的とするのには向いていないのでそこは気を付けてください。\n\nなによりも自分が気に入っていつまでも持っていたいと思える作品に出会ったらそれを購入して、多くの人にその作品とジェネラティブアートとArt Blocksの楽しさや良さを伝えていけるような良い出会いがあるのが一番だと思います。（👇は自分が持っていてお気に入りのHōrō）\n\n[https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096](https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096)\n\nブロックチェーンを通じてコードによって生み出されてNFTになる、という仕組みは多くのその他のカテゴリの中でもかなりNFT、ブロックチェーンをがっつり活用した仕組みだと思っています。自分はいつの間にかジェネラティブアートが大好きになってしまったので、これからも機会を見て作品を増やしたいな、と思っているのでした。",

180 度的大转变。面对复杂的宏观局面和美联储「不除通胀誓不休」的强硬态度，大部分人都对未来数年的经济形势抱有极端消极的情绪。\n\n而在众多宏观分析的声音中，有一支却与众不同。在 Luke Gromen 看来，美联储将很快结束加息进程，并回到量化宽松政策中，而欧美也将在未来 5 到 10 年迎来持续的高通胀。Luke Gromen 是 FFTT（Forest For The Trees）的创始人兼 CEO，这是一家宏观数据分析公司，它以独特的方式聚合大量公共数据，并在其中找出经济发展中的瓶颈领域。\n\n与普遍悲观的市场情绪相比，Luke 的观点显得格格不入，但当我们仔细了解他的论据后，又显得颇有道理。在本文中，BlockBeats 作者整理了 Luke 的观点框架，呈现了「美联储必须反转」的理由。\n\n### 交叉路口\n\n当前复杂多变的全球经济，是大部分投资者都没有经历过的，Luke 在一次采访中也承认，当前的国际宏观经济环境，是他从业 27 年来所见到最可怕、最复杂的。但总的来说，Luke 认为今天全球经济存在的主要问题有两个：主权债务，以及能源供给。\n\n#### 西方国家高额主权债务\n\n2000 年互联网泡沫破灭后，以美为代表的西方政府通过制造新的房地产泡沫，将债务问题转移至银行系统层面，以弥补股票市场造成的需求冲击。在 08 年房地产泡沫破灭后，决策者又通过制造新的主权债务泡沫，将债务转移至主权国家层面，以掩盖房银行次信贷泡沫造成的需求冲击。从此以后，主权债务泡沫就成了一切经济增长的后盾。\n\nLuke 认为，我们当前正在经历百年来第一个以西方为中心的全球范围内的主权债务危机，而当主权债务泡沫破灭时，便不再有更高层级的对手方来转移债务，因此只能将其转嫁至本国货币上。\n\n在过去 40 年里，我们见证了多次新兴市场的主权债务危机，但自第一次世界大战结束以来，我们还没有在发达国家见到过相似的情况。经济学家莱因哈德和罗戈夫在共同撰写的研究报告《从金融危机到债务危机》中，对过去两个世纪的主权债务危机进行了研究。在这 200 年里，债务占 GDP 比（Debt to GDP Ratio）达到 130% 的国家，98% 都出现了债务违约，大多数情况下以持续高通胀的形式呈现。现在美国的债务占 GDP 比已达到 129% 左右。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/7367e7cc60607c5d3faafde74fdeacde.jpg)\n\n当前唯一一个特例，即还没有违约债务的国家，就是日本。但我们也看到了，当前日本国债市场面临着巨大的压力，日本央行仍在努力保持着日本国债收益率的上限。\n\n#### 「廉价能源峰值」\n\n伴随全球主权债务泡沫的，是愈发不可忽视的能源危机，Luke 称其为「廉价能源峰值」（Peak Cheap Energy）。这并不是说石油和天然气资源即将耗尽，而是寻找和生产每一桶石油和天然气的边际成本正在不断增加。换句话说，廉价的石油和天然气时代已经一去不复返了。但由于全球经济系统中的的高额杠杆，各类资产估值中所映射的，却是越发稳定、便宜的能源供应，与实际情况完全相反。\n\n能源可以被看作是「大自然的折现率」，是任何经济都无法逃避与忽视的。而西方国家尤其是美国，却让政府和经济过度的依赖于廉价能源带来的的边际消费、边际 GDP 增长甚至是边际税收收入，将经济搭建在资产价格上涨的基础之上。\n\n#### 复杂的叠加\n\n当前的宏观环境，就处于这样一个独特的时期：不可持续的主权债务泡沫、面临上行通胀压力的能源价格。与此同时，「去全球化」进程的加速发展，也给通货膨胀带来了持续的上行压力。而美国、中国和俄罗斯之间的紧张局势更是火上浇油。\n\n当我们把所有这些宏观因素叠加在一起时，就能拼接出一个非常有毒性的宏观经济环境，未来愈发难以预测，市场波动性也不断加大，这种情况对散户还是机构来说，都非常棘手。\n\n### 加息是否合理？\n\n在「加息是否合理？」这个话题里包含了 Luke 的又一重要论点，主要集中在财政收支平衡，以及供应链改善这两个问题上。\n\n#### 「税收泡沫」\n\n净资本收益（Net Capital Gains）加上应税 IRA 分配是美国个人消费支出（Personal Consumption Expenditures）的重要驱动力，而 PCE 又占美国 GDP 的三分之二。所以一旦 PCE 开始下降，GDP 就很难上升，在债务占 GDP 比超 125% 的情况下，这很容易导致主权债务破产危机。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/63b45383123fb8283ded6122b2ee0563.jpg)\n\n而自 80 年代美国金融化以来，资产价格，尤其是股票价格的增长，成为了边际消费和 GDP，以及税收收入增长的关键驱动因素，是个人资本净收益的重要来源。所以如果要防止主权债务危机的出现，美联储同样也不能让股市下跌的情况持续太久。\n\n但在这个问题上，大多数投资者以及主流媒体的看法是这样的：的确，利率上调使美国政府的利息费用显着上升，但与整体税收收入相比，只是在约 12% 的占比上增加几个百分点而已，根本无关紧要。\n\n就数据来讲确实是如此，但 Luke 觉得仅从这个角度分析加息合理性存在着巨大的问题：\n\n首先，为摆脱新冠疫情产生的严重影响，美联储与财政部施行了史无前例的财政刺激政策，这也间接甚至直接制造出了当前我们所看到的「税收泡沫」。但随着财政政策的收紧以及利率上调，税收收入将快速、大幅的下降。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/bc22144f4bf0e54207947decfc74c577.jpg)\n\n其次，这个巨大的「税收泡沫」，仅在社保上就要花费近 70%。在过去十年里，该领域的支出增速始终保持在 5% 至 6% 左右，远高于美国 GDP 的增速。此外自疫情以来，美财政部的支出就一直在增加，在美联储加息后更是如此，每年将近 1 万亿美元。\n\n我们做一个简单的计算：目前美国的税收收入约 4 万亿美元，社保占了 2.8 万亿，财政支出再减去 1 万亿。把这些数据加起来后会发现，在「税收泡沫」存在的情况下，美国政府也只能勉强实现收支平衡。这还没有算上占税收 20% 的国防开支，当我们把这些政府支出也算入其中，就会出现财政赤字。\n\n也就是说，在过去六个月里，美国依靠创下数十年纪录的通胀率，勉强在社会层面保持了收支平衡。与此同时，在经济衰退、资产价格下跌的情况下，4 万亿美元的「税收泡沫」也会很快缩水，将美国拖入主权债务危机中。 \n\n在 Luke 看来，面对这样的困境，只有三条路可走：\n\n**1.**美联储再次开启「印钞机」，避免国债违约。\n\n**2.**美联储持续加息，将美元变成「卖方市场」。这也将进一步推高美元，并拖垮其他市场。同时随着利率上升，美国政府也会受到「借钱成本」和「税收泡沫」的双重夹击。\n\n**3.**政府削减财政、福利以及国防开支。而这无论从政治还是经济角度上讲，都是绝对不可能发生的事。\n\n这样一看，美联储未来要怎么走就很明显了，那就是在政府陷入债务危机前放开水龙头。而之所以还没有这样做，Luke 用了一个词进行解释——「Lightweight」。在他看来，不管是华府还是美联储，受政体影响而产生的「短期主义」思想都占据了主导地位。对于他们来说，目前的头号任务就是控制通胀，这是政治需求，别的后果一概暂不考虑。两年前「开闸大放水」时也是如此，只有当「1+1=2」的数学问题最终出现在面前时，大家才会寻找下一步的应对策略。\n\n#### 供应链问题\n\n「Supply Chain」也是最近在宏观投资者之间讨论火热的一个词汇。而在 Luke 看来，美联储对待本国供应链的态度，也存在着很大的问题。\n\n首先，美联储把供应链看作了一个短期的周期性问题。如上文所述，这种思维是受美国选举周期的影响。从周期性角度来看，通过诱导经济衰退来解决供应链问题是合理的。因为只要降低需求，供给侧就能够恢复平衡。\n\n但决策者们没有考虑到当前美国的债务危机，以及这种操作会触发主权债务死亡螺旋的可能性。随着美元升值，美国企业的也会受到严重影响。要知道，商业周期是与美元相反的，当利润下降、生产和借贷成本上升后，美国企业很可能被迫出现裁员潮，并抬高失业率，这种症状其实在波动较大的加密领域已经开始出现了。而高失业率也同样意味着财政支出的增加，形成一个恶性循环。\n\n其次，供应链问题的存在对美国其实有着战略性价值。自上世纪 80 年代以来，由于金融化以及保障石油美元体系的需求，美国政府在政策制定上始终是以保护债券市场利益为重要目标。这也极大地损害了美国中产阶级、工人阶级，甚至是美国本身的利益，无论是国家凝聚力还是制造力都大不如前。\n\n从长期来讲，美国需要一个供应链问题，因为它可以刺激投资。这意味着决策者们必须明确表态，放开通胀和美元，刺激工业、制造业等领域以带动 GDP 的增长。但这也意味着政府必须放弃保护债券市场的利益。\n\n想要走出主权债务危机，美国就需要持续的高通胀，政府必须退后一步，让债券持有人蒙受损失。但根深蒂固的短期主义让决策者们无法面对这种选择，因为持续高通胀的信号一旦出现，债券市场在数月内就会陷入混乱。譬如在几周前，房贷证券市场就出现了「No Bid」的情况，国债市场的流动性指标也处于次优状态。这时美联储将不得不介入，并实施收益率曲线控制政策，结果同样是高通胀与弱美元。\n\n### 关于能源\n\n自俄乌冲突后，能源价格一路高涨，也间接引发了美联储的一系列鹰派行为。而在西方政府决定制裁俄罗斯后，Luke 就第一个指出，俄罗斯能打的牌比西方国家要多得多，为此他在 Twitter 上还受到了不少攻击。从决策者到主流媒体，我们听到的言论都是：俄罗斯的 GDP 还不足美国的一个州，所以西方的制裁是稳操胜券。\n\n这是一个非常低级的错误。我们知道，俄罗斯石油天然气资源丰富，是能源出口的主要国家，而据统计，每生产一桶石油需要约 2.5 万个工时，对全球经济来说，这意味着巨大的价值。我们再来做一个简单的计算：如果全球平均工时的价值为 10 美元，那么每生产一桶石油就能对全球经济带来约 25 万美元的价值，这几乎是不可忽视和更改的「物理特性」。因此当我们把俄罗斯的石油天然气移出市场后，看到的局面与西方决策者们的想象就大相径庭了。\n\n起初西方国家的逻辑是：通过禁止俄罗斯的能源，以切断俄罗斯的收入。诚然，如果世界仍然处于二战后的两极化局面，那么这种制裁措施很快就会凑效。但在当今的多极世界，中国、印度等国已是俄罗斯的重要交易伙伴。因此我们看到的事实是，尽管俄罗斯的出货量大幅下降，但由于能源市场供货的紧缺，石油价格大幅上涨，俄罗斯的能源收入其收甚至创造出了历史最高水平。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/c181eb81f86129722031127f1d2764eb.jpg)\n\n石油天然气这些自然资源是社会经济的「第一性原理」，是经济的基石。它的影响远大于我们手机屏幕上所展示的、以 GDP 为衡量标准的经济数字。这个道理在亚洲国家之间普遍受到重视，尤其体现在对俄乌局势的反应上。但可惜的是，西方国家对这种「简单道理」似乎并不在意，我们甚至在主流媒体上看到有关「限制俄罗斯石油价格」「制裁俄罗斯黄金」等一类疯狂的言论。\n\n当我们从一个相对的角度来看这个问题时便会发现，西方尤其是欧洲国家，似乎正在进行「集体自杀」。我们知道，想德法等国都与俄罗斯有能源贸易往来，此前还希望通过北溪管道来进一步加大对俄罗斯能源的进口，为的就是摆脱从美国高价进口天然气，实现一定程度的能源独立。结果现在却主动寻求制裁，禁止进口俄罗斯天然气。\n\n我们试想一下，如果俄罗斯关闭对欧洲的天然气运输管道，那么一旦进入冬天，受影响的就不只是欧洲的经济了。在高纬度国家，供暖是必要需求，甚至关乎公民生命安全。而在应对能源供给问题的同时，欧洲还面临着困扰其数年的主权债务危机。在这种情况下，欧洲央行（ECB）要不就印钞，要不就违约，不管怎么说都会拖垮欧洲债券市场。其产生的涟漪效应将会回荡到美国，并在数天，甚至数小时内波及全球市场。\n\n### 前所未有，但非无史可循\n\n在最近的宏观话题讨论中，我们经常能听到上世纪 40 年代或 70 年代的类比。但 Luke 认为，当前的宏观环境非常复杂，没有哪个时代可以为我们提供明确的发展方向。因此投资者需要做的，就是把在比较相似部分的基础上，突出他们之间的差异。\n\n#### 70 年代\n\n在上世纪 70 年代，以美为首的西方国家经历了持续高通胀的「滞胀时期」。最终，时任美联储主席保罗沃尔克将利率上调至 20%，以几乎摧毁美国经济为代价打败了通胀，并为「石油美元」建立了极佳的信誉。\n\n和今天一样，70 年代的美国同样面临着能源危机带来的供应链冲击。也正因如此，很多人将美联储的鹰派作风视为「沃尔克再现」。但在整体宏观背景上，二者之间仍存在着很多不同。\n\n首先，那时美国正值「婴儿潮」陆续步入社会的阶段，人口结构要现在比年轻很多。其次，那时美国还尚未开启全面金融化进程，债务占 GDP 比例仅为 25% 至 30%，而不是像今天这样的超 120%。另外，政府的赤字占 GDP 比也只有 2% 左右，而在去年底，这一数字却达到了 12%。\n\n因此，当前的美国并不具备像 70 年代那样采取极端货币政策的条件。换句话说就是，有 70 年代的通胀，但没 70 年代对抗通胀的能力。不过尽管如此，我们从主流媒体和金融机构嘴里听到的，仍然是：加息，加息，再加息。\n\n#### 二战后\n\n另一部分人则把上世纪 40 年代做为自己的 Base Case，这帮人不一定投资债券，但却是债券市场的长期观察者，因此能意识到国家的债务问题。在二战结束后，美国债务占 GDP 比同样超过了 100%，国际市场不再追逐美国国债，和今天非常相似。\n\n当时美联储所做的就是，通过收益率曲线控制来保持国债收益率，并「放飞」了资产负债表和通货膨胀率。在接下来的 5 年里，美国的实际利率始终保持在负 10% 以下，债务占 GDP 比则从 1946 年的约 110% 下降至 1951 年的约 50%。美联储也在随后几年逐渐回归了正常化政策。\n\n但同样的，很多当时 GDP 增长的长期驱动力，如今已经不存在了。首先，二战后的美国是当时西方乃至世界上唯数不多的「赢家」，是当时世界最大的石油生产国。美国的工厂、美国的工人可以说就是在「重建世界」。但随着中国、印度、俄罗斯以及沙特国家的兴起，美国在能源和制造业上都已经没有了优势。而即便如此，40 年代的美国也经历了数年的高通胀和负利率，才走出了债务阴影。\n\n其次，当时的债券市场规模较小、金融化程度低，仍然受美联储控制，资本流动不是非常自由。所以美国能够在不引发市场混乱的情况下，长期保持负利率政策。但现在却完全不同，正如上文所述，当今的债券市场一旦闻到持续通胀的味道，立马就会闹开锅。这也就是为什么一些人常说：「The Fed is cornered」，加息要违约，降息要崩盘，两端受难。\n\n#### 一战后\n\n而在 Luke 看来，一战后的宏观环境与当前也有相似之处。一战后，欧洲大多数国家都累极了无法偿还的主权债务。而一战中的六大工业强国：美、英、德、法、俄、日，在接下来的 10 年里都贬值了自己的货币，其中德国马克的恶性通货膨胀最为著称，而像英美这样发行过国际储备货币的国家也不例外。到 1933 年，美元兑黄金贬值了约 75%，从每盎司 20 美元跌到了到 35 美元。\n\n当然，现在西方国家所面对的政治局势远不及德国当时那么恶劣。相比之下，反而是与 80、90 年代以及 2000 年以来的一些拉丁美洲主权债务危机有更多相似之处，但话又说回来，这些国家发行的并非是国际储备货币。\n\n#### 对投资者意味着什么？\n\n所以说，尽管每个时代都有与当前相似的部分，但几乎每个案例都有自己独特的变量。不过我们仔细观察就会发现，在上面提到的大部分案例中，债券市场都没有迎来「Happy Ending」，虽然投资者账面上没有损失，但其资产价值却遭到了大幅贬值。\n\n其次，一旦国家陷入了主权债务危机，原本的经济问题就很容易被政治化。就譬如今天，西方各国在债台高筑的情况下，仍然要将「战胜通胀」作为首要的政治任务，创造出美股 50 年来的最大跌幅；我们也看到主流媒体大肆宣扬「美联储将效仿沃尔克，与通胀作斗争」等等的政治化表征。而政治化最大的特点，就是不稳定性和波动性。\n\n最典型的例子就是上世纪魏玛共和国恶性通胀时期，马克兑黄金的价格波动。以马克为计价单位，黄金最终上涨至一万亿马克。但即便如此，当你仔细观察每月价格走势时，就会发现频繁的、巨幅的涨跌波动。这是因为在此期间，很多人受政治风向的影响，多次抛售黄金购买马克。而作为一个投资者，如果你在这一时期用杠杆做多黄金，不出一个月就会亏的一无所有。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/8ac0b798ad38dee36baeba1d9142134d.jpg)\n\n### The End Game\n\n「End Game」同样是最近的一个流行词。美联储究竟是持续鹰派，还是缓慢减速；如果重新 QE，通胀是否又会出现？而如文章开头所述，Luke 的 End Game 是：美联储将很快被迫停止加息，降低利率，并实施更多的量化宽松，以缓解美国的财政赤字。\n\n我们可以观察自上世纪 70、80 年代以来，美联储每次的加息周期。一个显著的特点就是，每次加息的幅度都要低于上一个周期，然后美联储就会重新打开印钞机。面对居高不下的石油价格，欧洲国家以及美国加州都已经出台了针对性的财政刺激。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/1664e2df6b339706ca8e76359d8bd613.jpg)\n\n而在 Luke 看来，受能源和主权债务的影响，国际地缘政治也将在接下来的半年里发生很大的变化。如上文所述，不管是欧洲还是日本，都面临着严峻的能源和债务形势。在气温转寒后必须依靠「美国盟友」的支援，要不就是提供能源支持，要不就是施行 QE，购买欧洲和日本国债。但这两个问题连对美国自身来说都非常棘手，这也为日本欧洲「转移阵营」制造了潜在的可能性。\n\n归根结底，在我们眼前展开的，是一场西方和俄罗斯之间的「资产负债表竞赛」。很显然，俄罗斯的情况要比欧美好得多，不仅有足够的黄金，每月还有大量的能源收入，而西方对此却束手无策。就在几周前，拜登专程拜访沙特国家，就是希望 OPEC 能够加大能源产量，以期降低石油的价格，并缓解通胀压力。\n\n而在文章开头提到，就美国的债务对 GDP 比例而言，已经到了「非违即胀」的程度。当然，作为世界储备货币的美元是否能成为特例，这是我们难以预测的，但依靠持续高通胀来缓解债务危机，在美国并非没有先例。而如果不违约，就意味着债券市场长达 40 年的「好日子」就此结束。因此在 Luke 看来，美联储和欧洲央行很可能在未来 3 个月停止加息步伐，回到量化宽松时代，并且接受债券市场出现的混乱局面。\n\n就对各类资产的看法，Luke 在一次访谈中也聊了自己的想法。他认为，在美联储「反转」前，美元与其他货币相比将持续强势，与此同时，大宗商品、能源与黄金也会有不错的表现。就比特币来说，尽管当前市场将 Crypto 与科技股看作是一笔交易，但 Luke 还是认为比特币将很快与股市分离，走出更像黄金的上行趋势。 \n\n当然，这并不意味着投资者就可以肆无忌惮的做多黄金、比特币等这些资产。还是像上文提及的，在极端政治化的经济环境里，不要用杠杆与波动性对抗，你不想成为第二个做多魏玛黄金的「Looser」。\n\n原文作者：0x137，BlockBeats\n\n来源：区块律动\n", "timestamp": 1658037330, "digest":

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KHP7WRJDmZEsHtx6WYe3a.png?height=2728&width=3773)\n\n**自序：我为什么研究DAOs**\n\n我初次接触DAO的概念，是2017年在Crypto创业搞智能合约的时候，The DAO和DAICO撬开了我对DAO的第一次认知。\n\n在当年的ICO其实存在两个问题，一是项目方的背书与项目大部分都是仓促包装，二是代币募资的手段依旧是通过私人钱包转账。后面发现了市场的需求，我们用一组智能合约来控制社区投资人与项目方的资金流转，并通过多签钱包来决定项目方的锁仓释放到约定地址。基于这个基础逻辑，再进一步完善链上提案与多签投票，这就是投研DAO的早期雏形。后来由于ICO监管政策的下发，不得不放弃这个产品的开发。\n\n再一次认真思考DAO的契机，在于2020年下半年，因工作需求在探索基于链上信用体系的社交网络，如何构建成为一个大型的开放世界网络，意外接触到了Metaverse的概念。随着研究逐步发现，基于区块链技术的加密货币交易网络，才能构建Metaverse开放式的、自由的、去中心化的经济系统。而我在研究链上社交网络时，从DID、DAO、链上信用治理协议，NFT数据确权，去中心化的数据商品交易与去中心化的仲裁网络等，都让我逐步形成了一个原生数字社会的整体认知，而这一切意味着，Metaverse的原生社会系统正在孕育中，DID、NFT、DAO是建设Metaverse原生社会系统的核心。\n\n我对Web3的认知路径，实际上我是从Crypto到Metaverse，再从Metaverse回到Web3，虽然在几年前就知道Gavin wood对Web3的描述，但因缺乏对数字社会的研究，以及缺乏涉猎广泛的社科知识，还不能深刻理解Web3革命的意义所在。然而2021年对DAO的理解止步人性不可技术量化的认知，而停下了探索脚步。\n\n2022年初所在的团队确定Web3的发展方向，并继承了过去2年所探索的社交信用，设计一款Social-DAO的产品，然而我在设计Social-DAO时所面临的最大难题，就是DAO的文化难题。文化是DAO治理机制的灵魂，DAO的治理会面临大量的价值观抉择问题，正如良好的经济制度激发人性之美，糟糕的经济制度纵容人性之恶。经济制度与治理机制的抉择，完取决于价值观的抉择。\n\n文化决定了一个DAO的价值观与发展原则，文化所形成的道德秩序，是DAO治理机制的设计原则。缺失文化秩序，意味着法律失去道德的约束，意味着你做一个更好的治理工具，只会加剧治理作恶的发生。所以，正是这些经历促使走上一条与众不同的DAO研究路线。\n\n而在同期阶段，也尝试搞了一个BMW DAO作为去中心化协同的实践，号召人才很容易，但是可持续发展的出路在哪？似乎是每一个尝试建立DAO的BUIDL都会面临这类问题。但是这次尝试让我意识到，真正优秀的Web3人才都散落在各种DAO，公司仅仅是他们摸鱼的后勤阵地。随后，便离职出来深度研究DAO，试图找到一个有效的突破口。\n\n三次探索DAO的契机，止步于政策，人性，文化，对于那些艰巨的难题，俗话说事不过三，这一次大胆跳进这个兔子洞，多少个苦苦冥思的夜晚，翻阅了大量的材料，撰写了很多废稿，目录结构推翻了N遍，终于从DAOs网络，协议聚合器，产权制度，开放式Loot的可组合NFTs，以及治理制度的整合设计，总算撬动了一个突破口。\n\n可能有不少朋友看到我在DAO的探索中有一种偏执，因为对于一个困扰了几年的难题，出现三次止步的难题，假设这一次不倾注心血搞定，可能还会碰到第四次，第五次，第六次...\n\n希望这篇深度研究，能够对各位DAO BUIDL带来有效的启发，有机会一起合作，推进DAO的建设与发展。\n\n文末有关于DAOs to World 的彩蛋，记得不可错过。\n\n感谢@茶灯灯lightness.eth

Crypto 2）加密运动的社区文化与正统性意义，建设Web3的精神信仰](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2NzEyMjY1OA==&mid=2247484310&idx=1&sn=5807704a58931846bac2fd40e241af6b&chksm=ce412f1bf936a60d81d69877e924513911465e3d45437859467ea9575bbf19486d1a1cfc68c9&scene=21#wechat_redirect)一文所描述：\n\n“加密运动的精神是为了避免世界陷入极权主义的控制与垄断，例如现代化国家与互联网技术的融合，形成了数字化社会管理机制，于进步主义视野是提高了整个社会的治理效率。然而，技术永远是一把双刃剑，特别是在历史动荡的时期，极权主义兴起的国家主义与数字资本主义的结合，很可能会诞生赛博朋克意识流的数字利维坦出现，控制论革命通过计算机网络实现人类社会的数字化全面侵蚀。”\n\n自加密精神的诞生起，个人主权的思想随着三大路径Crypto-Web3-Metaverse的发展演化，随着我们掌握自己的财富，掌握自己的资源，掌握自己的空间，我们将掌握自己的生存发展的机会，我们在有限的资源时空里面，通过对抗工业化的资本集中制度，实现了每一个个体安身立命的生存基础。\n\n**Crypto：保护私人的财富安全且可以自由交易**\n\n**Web3：保护私人的自主产权且可以自由劳动**\n\n**Metaverse：保护自身的生存空间且可以自由发展**\n\n这部分内容具体详见[BUIDL The DAOs：DAO如何超越资本主义](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2NzEyMjY1OA==&mid=2247484327&idx=1&sn=8fea17c550a7ddac3880f87ffa462203&chksm=ce412f2af936a63ce166385395c86d11bd478030b5b817eb4fe902377158badde95cceff5824&scene=21#wechat_redirect)\n\n### 技术实现背后的价值观\n\n我们通常忽略“技术哲学观”，即指导技术方案如何实现的价值观，正如POW与POS两种不同的共识机制，背后是不同理念的技术应用体现，而延续该理念的跨学科实践，即基于POW的治理经济模型不依赖于历史的计算优势，意味着以公平性随时随地可以加入到整个比特币网络当中开始计算。而在POS的治理经济模型需要抵押token参与到节点的计算权限，并且随着质押Token的数量级与时间，获得了历史的计算优势，意味着先发者将获得更大的优势。\n\n\\*\\*技术实现背后的价值观决定了技术方案的未来走向。\\*\\*例如Crypto与Web3的DAO，是同一种技术原理的不同范式体现。Web3的核心是产权回归的数据权益经济，而Crypto的核心是记录账本数据状态的唯一性。而正是区块链技术在Crypto与Web3的同一性，导致我们对DAO应用出现了理念到应用的混淆，这是现阶段普遍存在的。\n\n**Web3产权回归的内核**\n\n用户拥有个人数据的所有权，是Web3的核心观念，Web3的建设都需要围绕这个核心命题进行，属于Web3的真正商业模式的趋势，是以用户的数据所有权所分离出的具体权能的商业应用模式，例如数据使用权的收益激励。\n\n然而，数据所有权和所有制是有一定的区分，所有权是所有制的实现方式之一，所有制由一个国家的社会制度所决定。这一特点为我们在建设Web3的所有权商业模式时，与所在地的国家制度与政策提供了一个平衡的契机，这是未来合规性的关键所在。\n\n身份自主权是Web3产权的另一个核心，简单比喻，分离具体权利的权能是一个所有权持有者的核心权利体现，也是其个人自主意志的体现，不受中心结构约束其权能的使用。在Web3的讨论范畴中，身份自主权是个人主权思想与产权制度的融合体现。\n\n为了进一步了解什么是产权，我需要简单科普下什么是产权制度\n\n### 产权制度的重要性\n\n> **关于产权的基本定义**\n>\n> 关于产权的基本定义——“产权是指“一个社会所实施的选择种经济品的使用的权利”，它包括人们对一种资源的使用权、收益权与转让权。从产权的角度上来说，一切交易行为都是进行该资源的权利交易行为，而交易的达成，则是双方进行资源重组和转让条件的合约谈判。而交易费用的存在，则使得交易当事人之间会采用不同的合约安排形式。\n>\n> 支配交易的真正基础是物品或资源所有者对它所拥有的权利，价格只是对附着于这一物品的权利的衡量。\n>\n> “一个人所拥有的不是资源，而是该资源的权利”\n\n> **产权与所有权的关系**\n>\n> 产权并不是资源持有者与资源之间的关系，而是资源持有者对资源的权利关系，以及资源持有者与其他相关人，不相关人的一切权利关系。所有权作为一种财产权利，是产权所有制的一种实现方式，但不是唯一方式。\n\n> **产权的完整界定原则**\n>\n> 大陆法中对所有权的制定原则，不是对资源的具体权利的有限列举，而是尽所有可能的权利。这就是产权与所有权的“完整界定”原则。\n>\n> 而拥有所有权的人也被赋予了分离具体权利的权能，并且分离出的权利可由他人实施。例如租赁权，使用权均为所有权的具体分离权利。\n\n> **产权制度的两大权能**\n>\n> 排他性与可让渡性是产权最重要的权能。\n>\n> 排他性有两层含义：一是选择资源使用的排他性，即决定谁在特定的方式下有使用稀缺资源的权利，对公寓拥有完整产权的主体有权决定如何使用公寓，是自己住还是出租，是根据价格来出租还是根据关系来出租。二是对资源收益权的排他性，如果所有者选择将公寓出租，他就有权从财产的服务中获得所有租金收入。\n>\n> 可让渡性是以互相同意的条款交易资源的权利，所有者有权决定按任意价格通过交互将资源出租，出售，甚者授权给他人使用。转让权是市场合约的一个先决条件，资产权的使用权与收益权不一定包含资产的转让权，但资产的转让权一定包含资产的使用权与收益权。\n\n> **产权激励经济的功能**\n>\n> 产权作为一种制度对于促进经济的效果非常明显，通常具有预期和激励两种功能：\n>\n> “产权安排如果造成经济主体预期不稳，它所产生的激励就是负向的；产权安排如何是生产性的，就会降人们的行为引向有利于社会财富增长的努力；产权安排如果是分配性的，就会将人们的行为引向非生产性努力”\n\n以上内容引用自《现代社会秩序的制度基础》\n\n这就是当前Web3以及DAO普遍存在的问题，唯有发生产权激励的生产性行为，才能促进Web3领域的正外部性发展，而目前很多Crypto项目的DAO，正是其代币经济模型作为分配性的结果，导致社群往非生产性方向努力。产权制度的缺失是目前大多Web3项目与DAO所出现的问题，并且是根源性的问题。\n\n## DAO治理机制的规则悖论\n\n### 针对DAO的四层批判\n\n针对DAO的深度批判，详细可见我在[加密精英的傲慢：对DAO的深层批判 / 论DAO的七宗罪 / DAOs微观权力结构](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2NzEyMjY1OA==&mid=2247484321&idx=1&sn=4ec8f7a705c6d3bcca4ab9bd47a05e93&chksm=ce412f2cf936a63a11605971379ae5657fa50e404a5ded9efdb7f5d58ce4efb2f279e2a16575&scene=21#wechat_redirect)一文的描述，在此处仅简单描述：\n\n**表征性：权益治理的不平等**\n\n以经济权重为治理依据的POS共识，确保过程分配的公平性，但无法保障外部优势利用规则形成的不平等结果，例如社区的利益相关者可以为了投票选中对自己有利的提案，可以从外部借用大量资金进行抵押，获得利益结果后再撤销。在Defi的大量DAO的治理项目中，POS的股权制思想的体现了股东话语权的经济结果，无法承载Web3产权核心制的治理需求。Defi项目之所以普遍存在这个情况，在于大多数项目都在割韭菜。\n\n**根源性：共识算法的局限性**\n\n“为了解决POW算法的缺点，业内开始提出POS共识机制，POS不仅仅是为了解决POW资源浪费的问题，更试图提出一种新的共识价值观范式，即账本参与者需要质押自身的利益，能够更好地避免节点作恶的概率。这其实是一种价值观的技术设计理念，并不代表客观的事实，事实证明DAO对权益证明的应用，充满了节点联合作恶的现象。”\n\n**社会性：自由民主的幻觉**\n\n自由民主作为一种社会理念的宣传口号，而一旦落实到社会制度的实践上面，维护一套社会制度不仅需要与深层次的文化观念融合，同时维持社会制度需要庞大的经济支撑。当试图通过DAO来实现所谓的“自由民主”的社会愿景时，反而成了滋养各种自由民主迷思的温床，成为了各种不切实际幻想的精神载体。我们可以看到大量的DAO自以为投票选举就是自由民主的体现，却不具备对制度性的深层思考，把服务民主的操作手段误认为这就是民主制度的体现。\n\n**历史性：加密精神的沦丧**\n\n阿桑奇曾在《密码朋克》一书对全世界的告诫：**“为了免受一切权力以任何暴力形式而让渡个人的权利。”**\n\n加密精神的意义在于让个人主权意识的觉醒，而比特币的诞生背景，在于保护个人私有财富不受传统金融系统的沾染。而在Web3时代所继承的加密精神，是个人产权意识的觉醒，即个人拥有自身数据的所有权，并有权决定该数据的金融变现方式。“数据价值的自定义”应该是建设Web3需要值得思考的关键问题。\n\nCrypto与Web3当前依旧处于文明发展史的原始期，如果缺乏对正统精神的继承，不保护个人的财富，也不保护个人的产权，这样的Web3的项目，这样的DAO项目，要么是在割韭菜，要么是在自欺欺人。\n\n### 路径依赖的经验惯性\n\n实际上，今天我们建设DAO的认知，依旧深受早期The DAO，ICO，与DAICO思想的影响，尤其是Defi的赛道的爆发，Staking质押治理的普遍影响力，导致我们在Web3的范畴中，**对于DAO治理的思想惯性，经常受到Crypto原生路径的干涉。**\n\n不管当前DAO的各种治理手段看起来是多么的体现出一种集体自治理的民主制，围绕共识所建立的治理机制的内核才是关键。例如当前的DAO所遵循的范式，是以DAICO为内核的DAO，其内核是一种去中心化的项目投资与资金管理方式，通过多个智能合约的连环控制，实现从募资，质押，到清算的链上交易行为。\n\nDefi使得AMM协议与Staking经济成为Defi的主要建设方式，而忽略了DAICO作为一种更具有价值的链上投资交易的协同作用。但不管如何，DAICO所主导的Crypto -DAO的范式思想依旧影响着当前Web3-DAO的建设。\n\n建设Web3的DAO必定要摆脱DAICO路径依赖的经验惯性，我们需要重新回归对POS与POW共识争议的问题根源，从新理解共识机制是如何影响集体决策。POW与POS的博弈，是破解DAO治理难题的关键所在。\n\n### 伪民主的DAO治理机制\n\n治理代币的存在，一方面扩大并维护了共识的价值，另一方面也让治理权力成为一种可被交易的流动性权力关系。这就意味着**民主的集体决策成为一种可被货币操纵的治理机制。**\n\n如果从公司制的股权权重来看，治理代币的存在似乎合情合理，持有更大比例的股东拥有更多的决策权。而从社会治理的角度来看，治理代币意味着治理的决策者职位可以通过交易购买，这种权力腐败的行为，是个正常社会都会杜绝的事情。\n\nDAO作为一种新的自治组织理念，共同治理不仅仅是投票这个动作，而是从组织结构与治理制度上实现真正的共同治理。明目张胆忽略经济的外部优势，介入到DAO的所谓公平投票手段，实际上只是自由资本的优势方，对其他DAO成员的资本收割。\n\n用一堆看似符合民主自治的治理手段与经济激励，掩饰其自身制度框架的缺陷，这是当前DAO普遍存在问题，**共同治理缺乏制度保障**，这样的DAO一旦脱离经济刺激就基本很难持续发展。\n\n## 制度缺陷导致DAO的发展困境\n\n### 币权替换了产权\n\nWeb3的意义在于产权回归运动，DAO的参与者所享有的是围绕共同产权所享有的一切收益回报，产权关系决定了治理的权能。而**治理代币替代了产权关系所赋予的真正的治理权能，进而剥夺了DAO的参与者真正的治理权利。**\n\n**币权替换了产权，是当前DAO治理制度的根本矛盾**，数据所有权与身份自主权都在这个制度框架中，被治理代币的比例权重替代，这是个体主权被金融异化的方式，也是为何目前大量DAO的参与建设者，感受不到自己作为具有自主性意志的个体，所应得的个人主权价值。\n\n一切缺乏产权制度的DAO，一切可交易流通的治理代币决定治理权重的DAO，都是加密自由资本所操纵的虚伪民主的DAO，任何外部生产业务的引进，其核心是继续形成对参与者的劳动剩余价值的剥削。“白嫖”是对这一根本症结的讽刺。\n\n### 不平等制度的虚假公平\n\n当一种组织制度从根本上是不平等的制度时，无论其表现形式采用看起来多么民主的手段，注定是一种违背民主精神的不平等制度。**治理代币作为一种流动性权力的体现，使得去中心化自治成为形同虚设。**\n\n投票仅作为一种公平手段，仅仅是治理决策机制最后的那个“投篮动作”，但这种表现形式最容易成为“戏剧表演”的宣传，也是最容易激起民粹主义意识形态的象征动作。最后导致集体狂热追求一切“民主手段”，而无视社会发展的基本常识。\n\n不可避免，这是未来DAO的浪潮真正兴起之时，DAO的狂热支持者会普遍出现的情况，以此试图形成彻底颠覆旧秩序的威慑力。\n\n不平等治理制度的缺陷，还体现在集体决策的“集体迷思”现象。\\*\\*“追求全体一致的压力非常强大时，这种压力就会使这个决策团体出现消极逃避行为模式，进而导致决策团体偏向于选择那些最不会遭到反对的方案”，\\*\\*类似发生集体迷思的DAO治理案例，在过去一年当中发生的并不少见，例如社区舆论裹挟投票让核心创始人下台。\n\n一个追求平等的民主制度，背后需要一个追求正义的道德秩序，否则民主沦为民粹仅一步之遥。如果忽略了制度性的思考，也就无法触及到这一层面的问题对治理公平性的影响。\n\n## 第二部分：审视\n\n## 社会结构的进化\n\n### 什么是社会进步\n\n当“社会”这一词汇被创造出来之时，其本身就具有进步主义的思想隐喻，正如任何一个社会的发展预期，永远只能是为了更好地生存发展而建设，一个美好的社会应该是怎样的？以及我们又应该朝着哪个方向而努力。所以，当我们在思考任何社会问题的时候，无论是对丑陋的批判，又或者是对美好的歌颂，都是源自于我们对社会进步的渴望。\n\n**社会进步主要体现在对社会的两种改善，一种是纠正异常，一种是提升常态。**\n\n纠正异常的前提条件是理解当前社会什么是常态，如果一个人不清楚什么是一个社会应该的常态就试图纠正社会上的异常情况，就像一个医生在不知道一个人的正常健康状态下，就给“病人”动手术治病。\n\n提升常态是指将社会从常规水平提升到一个更高的水准，提升常态是一种底线发展原则，意义在于从社会制度/结构上实现系统化的升级，例如消除绝对贫困这样的社会任务，就是一种提升底线发展原则的社会进步。\n\n### 社会协同的博弈\n\n猎鹿博弈与猎兔博弈是指猎人在打猎时，根据其共同的狩猎目标而形成的博弈关系。猎鹿博弈与猎兔博弈是一组互相转化的博弈关系。\n\n通常情况下，单个猎人可以捕捉兔子，而猎鹿则需要一群猎人齐心协力共同完成，而一旦其中有任一个猎人在途中狩猎兔子，都将会导致猎鹿的失败。\n\n猎鹿的动机在于通过集体合作获得更大的收益，而猎兔则是为了个人的利益而狩猎。猎鹿博弈的启示在于，集体所形成的社会合作所涉及到的博弈关系。\n\n在猎鹿博弈中，只有所有的猎人心中都寻求猎鹿的共同目的，整体才会形成猎鹿博弈，而一旦其中有任何一人转向猎兔目的，则狩猎集体又将迅速转化为猎兔博弈。\n\n猎鹿博弈本质上是组织结构与生存策略的协同进化，一方面在猎鹿过程中，避免任何合作方出现背叛一定是出自于其文化观念的道德约束，因为在猎鹿过程中一旦出现猎兔的机会，缺乏道德自觉的猎人一定会选择猎兔行为。**猎人在行动上的道德自觉性，是猎鹿博弈的关键。**\n\n### 社会结构中的能动性\n\n能动性是社会结构的构成因素之一，社会中的个体有能力在自己所处的社会关系中施加某种程度的控制，反过来也意味着有能力使得这些社会关系发生改变。所以，在某种程度上来说，**能动者被社会结构赋权，得以协同或者对抗他人的活动。**\n\n能动性是个体在社会结构当中，与生俱来的特点，而能动性的体现方式又是种类极为繁多，并且是由其文化和历史所决定的。社会结构对不同的能动者进行了不同的赋权，使其表现出不同的欲求、意图以及相关知识，结构以及所赋予的人类能动性充斥着各种不同的权力。\n\n能动性是集体的也是个体的，个人运用能动性的范围很大程度上是由于他们在集体性组织内的位置所决定的，个人运用的能动性在的各种资源和方式主要来自于集体，也正是因为个人能动性的差异造就了集体的权力差异。而能动者的共识也是改变集体关系的共识。\n\n在某种程度上，能动者是基于自己的动机与目的，建立协同关系或者破坏关系，而在遵循道德伦理的法理学理论当中，对于能动性概念倾向于这么一个等式，\\*\\*“能动性”=“道德责任”=“道德正当性的情境”，\\*\\*能动者的道德自觉性，作为其内在的动机或者意图，才能确保其行动的在社会秩序当中的合理性。\n\n## 探讨产权制度的原则\n\n### 产权的根本：完整性与自主性\n\n完整性与自主性是我们在探讨Web3产权制度的两个根本所在。首先关于完整性，完整性是指尽可能所有的完整所有权，\\*\\*完整所有权不是对具体权利的有限列举，而是尽所有可能的权利。\\*\\*完整所有权是所有者对一个资源所具有的最大可能的利益，不管是已知的，还是未知的。\n\n对于产权的完整性界定，在另一个角度，是以对该资源权利的排他性来衡量。排他性包括对资源使用的排他性，以及所拥有权利的转让性。例如，所有者可以阻止其他人使用或者出借，保留其所拥有而权力，避免任何人从该资源中获益。\n\n正如我自身将来在Web3的应用生态中，所拥有的一切数据资源，我有权将其烂在我的本地硬盘，拒绝任何人以及任何组织的使用。\n\n随着商业环境的演化，产权的功能逐渐复杂与多样化，而基于完整所有权的持有者，所具有的具体权利的分离权能，就显得非常重要。正是因为资产的所有权，我们的资产才得以通过具体分离的权利，例如租赁权，抵押权等方式，在商业环境中持续获得价值。\n\n\\*\\*具体权利的分离权能是产权主体所具有的，最重要的自主权力，\\*\\*只要交易约定能够达成共识，主权个体有资格分离出任何具体的产权权利，分离具体权利的权能，是主权思想在产权的重要体现。\n\n个人数据资源的所有权，以及具体权利的分离权能，都是我们在Web3的相关产品，以及DAO的相关产权制度中，极其重要的权益基础。而在当前阶段，*我们所看到的各种Xfi的产品，我们几乎没有看到这方面的制度设计，这些都是虚假的Web3的产品，必须大胆承认这一客观事实。*\n\n### 制度的天平：共赢与共治\n\n共赢重要还是共治重要？当我们在讨论共同治理的时候，我们不能忽略追求共同治理是为了集体共赢。**共赢是目标，共同治理则是我们为了实现这一目标的手段。**\n\n公共治理的民主决策，有时候被狭隘的自我完善主义者扭曲为理解为“个人权利重于集体权利”，然而公共治理的条件成立的基础，在于集体所处的公共空间，即个人所生存发展的环境，治理的意义在于对公共空间的资本分配，以及权力关系的约束。事实上，一个好的社会制度，集体共赢往往优先于集体共治，**集体共赢才有足够的社会盈余来确保社会常态的基本底线，共赢才能保障社会发展的可持续性。**\n\n我们对于共治的执着，体现在在于对“自由与平等”的强烈渴望，甚者不少人对DAO的民主投票制度的捍卫，时常引用古希腊雅典的城邦民主制，*当然，从文化历史的根源上来说，DAO的自治所体现的政治共同体，确实源自于雅典民主制，当面临个体利益与集体利益的抉择时，这也是肤浅的民主捍卫者们所掌握的历史武器，但是时候戳破这个不切实际的幻想了。*\n\n> “一个强调集体决策的天赋智慧和约束性质、强调公民自由和所有公民的平等的信仰系统，形成了雅典民主的 ‘宪法’（一个用来描述雅典政体那些得到正式承认的原则与实践的词汇，虽然不准确，但是很方便）的基础。自由和平等都是有限的、有条件：个人自由受制于个人必须服从集体利益，平等则只限于政治领域。雅典人从来没有发展出个人的不可剥夺的‘消极权利’（私人事务不受政府干涉的自由）原则，或者相对于国家的少数人权利原则，这就是当代自由主义的核心原则。”\n>\n> 《民主雅典的精英与大众》\n\n### 社会制度确保社会正义的必要性\n\n对于正义的理解，决定了我们理解什么是良好的社会制度，什么是糟糕的社会制度，一个社会对正义的坚持与追求，决定了社会人民的整体权利的正当性，以及对于人民尊严的基本尊重。\n\n例如一个充满剥削的社会，一个资本异化的社会，将人民异化为资本的劳动力，将人格扭曲为社会生产的机器，这是对人类基本的尊严的践踏，这是一个违背人类道德的非正义行为；\n\n构建一个人人平等的社会，是我们追求正义的目标结果之一，假如一个社会制度缺乏对人权平等的捍卫，那么权力的差异比较导致强势群体对弱势群体的人格尊严践踏。\n\n捍卫正义的社会平等制度，才能个体所有权的一切权利的使用，提供了合理的正当性。\\*\\*设想一个不伸张正义的社会制度，暴力掠夺将成为常态，\\*\\*个人产权将完全没有保障，所谓的个人主权也将成为幻灭的美梦。\n\n## DAO治理的道德秩序\n\n### Code is Law要接受道德观念的约束\n\n\\*\\*法律绝非精英的治理游戏，必须接受道德观念的约束。\\*\\*道德与法律两者之间的互相促进的作用，构成了现代法治社会的治理方式。道德与法律背后体现的是社会秩序的二元结构，即法律明文的规定与管理，社会道德氛围的文化规训。\n\nCode is law似乎有点成为了技术掌权者肆意使用的某种技术权力，缺乏道德的约束，技术作恶的现象将一发不可收拾，尤其是加密金融领域，充斥着金钱诱惑的世界。\n\nDAO的链上治理机制，不仅仅是基于代码实现，也要在代码实现的规则当中，体现道德观念的约束，**Code is Morality and law才是正确的技术观念**，技术作为一种工具手段必须平衡好道德与法律。\n\n代码是构建数字世界的字符工具，同时也是语义规则的体现，而语义规则与道德系统在社会结构当中具有同一性，因为对于Code is law若是缺乏道德秩序的约束，那么数字资本主义将通过技术手段不可避免地进行数字社会的全方面异化，主权思想的文化精神也将由此泯灭而失败的，Web3革命也将由此失败。\n\n### 灵魂不可出售，道德不能定价\n\n赎罪券是中世纪时期，基督教的道德观堕落，哪怕是教职人员堕落犯罪，都可以通过购买圣徒遗物与赎罪券，来对上帝表达忏悔并由此得到灵魂的救赎。而这一切起源，在于**教会开始强调外在效果的形式化道德标准，进而不可避免地导致道德普遍的虚伪化，最终堕落为被金钱异化的地步。**\n\n宗教改革运动的一大成就，就是将宗教的道德信仰，从追求形式化的道德标准进行瓦解，信徒可以通过内心直接与上帝对话，忏悔，无须要经过教堂这一中间机构，作为上帝的代理人。\n\n灵魂是人权的本真性，如果人权被贩卖销售，那么和奴隶制没什么区别，如果道德可以被交易，那么就是现代版的数字赎罪券运动。\n\n我之所以如此担忧，在于治理代币的道德意义上，就已经在发生一场现代版的赎罪券运动了。具有社会治理权力的能力个体，即具有影响社会关系的能动者，一定要求其具有内在道德的自觉性，而治理代币则让治理的道德成为可被交易的商品，抹除了个体建立内在道德自觉性的社会基础。\n\n### 自我赋权是一种道德自治\n\n对人权尊严的基本尊重，体现在包容每个人的自我肯定与内心的自由追求，**个人主权思想是一种内心自我解放的思想，因为内心不自由的个体无法获得我们所寻求的意义上的自由。**\n\n唯有充分实现自我肯定的个体，才能实现内心意义上的自由解放，唯有这个时，才是每一个独立个体的觉醒时刻。\n\n**自我赋权源自于个体对自我权利的赋能**，即每一个因为内心的诉求而发挥自己的能动性，这背后既源自于政治共同体所赋予的治理权力，也源自于道德观念赋予每个人的主权权利。\n\n自我赋权作为一种德道自治的行为，而不是任由个人欲望放纵的行为，一切符合道德自治的行为，都是建立在政治共同体中，一种互相承认的共识原则。\n\n### 求同存异：包容文化的复合性\n\n文化复合性是指，在不同的社会共同体当中，内部结构与外在实体呈现一种杂糅的状态，例如在神话典故中，“龙”作为一种图腾符号，就是不同部落文化杂糅而成为一种新的文化象征。\n\n\\*\\*文化复合性是自我与他者关系的结构化形式，没有哪一种文化是完全孤立的单体，\\*\\*文化总是处于与其他文化不断地接触与互动交流的过程中。\n\n所以说，文化一种可以被习得的共识，通过所处环境的互动交流，逐步形成一种价值观念，主导并约束在文化所处的环境当中的所作所为。\n\n文化作为象征意义的系统，既是抽象的，也是可以变迁的，对于多元文化的复合结构的理解，必须以一种动态的流动性视野来看待。而这一过程又是通过持续不断的文化接触与互动交流得以体现，这是一个社会的文化之所以能够得到持续发展的原因所在。\n\n在某种程度上来说，文化的复合性与包容性越强，则文化的活跃度越高，**文化活跃是一个社会经济繁荣与政治稳定的象征。**\n\n## 第三部分：蜕变\n\n## 治理权力的约束与赋能\n\n### 制度矛盾与权力冲突\n\n简单来说，社会实践是由一系列行动构成的，而这些行动主要体现为各种互动的形式，包括涉及到意义的沟通这一互动形式，这种构成性结构是“社会共同体”的特征。\n\n互动的生成有三个基本要素：作为“有意义的”互动构成；作为道德秩序的互动构成；作为权力关系的互动构成。\n\n**互动的意义是积极而持续地协商的结果**，例如在日常生活中，互动的参与者们通过制造、理解和使用语言，从而形式对句子的互相理解。而这一过程是以一种共有知识作为阐释框架，以确保在互动过程中，创造和维持着沟通的情境。\n\n互动的“意义”形式，正是我们通过交流形成共识的关键所在。\n\n互动的道德因素与互动的“意义”因素和权力关系因素是有机地联系在一起的 ，道德秩序的互动构成是权利的实现与义务的履行，而正是意义的互动结构形成我们在互动中的道德秩序。\n\n在互动的形式当中，道德秩序的互动矛盾是引起权力关系矛盾的关键所在，通俗来说，**正是因为观念的矛盾形成权力制度上的矛盾。**\n\n### 权力关系的约束与赋能\n\n在社会结构的互动形式中，每一个互动都是道德关系和权力关系的互动。道德秩序下所要求的权利和义务，同互动的权力关系一起，同时具有约束与赋能的作用，例如一个人在社会实践当中，其所践行的义务没有得到认可或尊重，或者没有得到有效的约束，那么基于道德与权力的互动关系当中的权利与义务的平衡就会被打破。\n\n对于治理权力的约束与赋能，绝非通过经济手段的奖惩机制，否则这将会导致经济与权力形成新的互相制约与赋能关系，进而导致权力腐败的出现。治理权力的约束与赋能必须置身于一个更加完整全面的社会结构当中。\n\n## 去中心化治理协议实现DAO的治理\n\n### 协议作为治理规则的体现\n\n当我们试图构建一个平等社会的时候，实际上是在建立一个公平游戏的规则，\\*\\*一个公平游戏的规则是公开透明且对所有参与者都是一致性的。\\*\\*而这个似乎正是POW共识更加体现出来的优势。\n\n社会系统的各种治理手段，秩序、制度以及机制等都是规则的不同体现，而良好的规则一定是符合社会道德的规范与要求，规则作为一种社会治理的共识而被共同遵循。\n\n对于执行规则的条件约定，是社会契约的体现，而协议作为基于契约关系的双边约定，其具体的书面形态常以法律合同的方式体现。\n\n所以，在一场所有人遵循共识的公平游戏规则当中，**建立协议是参与者达成共识的关键约定条件。**\n\n### 协议作为治理权力的体现\n\n协议作为执行规则的约定条件，协议所体现的共识是对双边关系的约束与赋能。在双方在互动结构中，所各自具备的权利以及义务。这就是协议作为治理权力对双边关系的重要性体现。\n\n在福柯的权力谱系理论中，\\*\\*权力关系存在于任何存在差异的个体之间，\\*\\*这是从双边关系的差异中对权力的提炼与定义，实际上意味着这种微观的权力关系无处不在，并且渗透在社会系统的方方面面。\n\n协议作为一种天然的关系型权力，因为人员的流动性因此也具备了权力的流动性特征。而这在社会的互动结构中，意味着个体的能动性将牵引着协议关联着自身所能影响到的一切权力关系当中，进而通过协议载体来实现权力关系对人脉关系的改造，现实当中的一个典型例子，就是商业活动对人脉资源的利用并建立合作契约。\n\n### 协议作为文化秩序的体现\n\n通过上文，有意义的互动中可以看到，意义的结构通常也是基于共同知识的语义规则系统。而正是**语义规则系统的二重性，形成了社会结构的二重性，即结构既是人类行动的结果，也是引导人类行为的媒介。**\n\n**社会互动中的结构二重性**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K9XpyPlE1RKZ285_TmSuM.png?height=324&width=762)\n\n总而言之，沟通、权力和道德是互动的有机因素，而意义、支配和合法化是结构的特征；这些特征只有在分析意义上才能区分开来。因此，进一步补充，支配结构可以视为资源系统，合法化结构可以视为道德规则系统，这些形态都是有机的整体，而不是互相独立的组成部分。\n\n而与集体的整体性来看，语义规则和道德规则，通过规范的诠释框架存在一个共同的文化，而权力则通过支配结构中的工具，形成对意义结构与合法化结构的互动关系。\n\n因此，在这个结构的二重性当中，协议作为权力的工具，形成对互动结构中的支配作用。\n\n\\*这段源自阐释社会学理论，比较复杂，后续会单独研究输出一篇文章。\n\n## 基于去中心化治理协议的治理结构\n\n### 探讨去中心化治理的视野局限\n\nDAO的治理并非是技术实现的难题，而是基于政治、哲学、经济、社会与文化等构成的技术实现的治理难题，**这是一个高度复杂且多学科杂糅的系统性难题。**\n\n实际上，当前的我们更多是通过技术手段的方式，改造具体生产关系当中的某个具体业务动作，暂时还不涉及到去中心化治理会写形成什么样的组织结构以及社会制度。\n\n所以，在现阶段当中，我们必须承认当前阶段的视野局限性，我们所能够做的，就是站在尽可能的视野去看见这个全新的组织形态将会如何。而我基于我当前的一切认知，也是具有局限性，但同时也仅仅是阶段性的，我会保持高频率的认知与思考的更新，并联合更多的力量进行实践。\n\n### 基于去中心化治理协议的基础模型\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uc6cOP_JUFDemTZa6aH9I.png?height=587&width=1080)\n\n实际上，当我们在讨论去中心化治理的时候，需要进一步分析，治理作为权力方式的构成，自治是一种民主权力的体现，然而，权力的构成分为决策的权力与执行的权力。其次，权力的使用主体与权力的作用对象，又是一个什么样的关系？至少要梳理明白治理背后的权力构成与权力关系，才能正确找到合适的“去中心化的治理方式”，也就是\\*\\*“去中心化的权力结构”\\*\\*\n\n所以，基于去中心化的权力结构关系当中，DAO本身作为一个权力的决策与权力的执行主体，进而实现对DAO的组织成员的权力支配，目前的主流观念中，将这一过程视为“去中心化的治理”，然而，我想说的是，这是一种狭义的去中心化治理的认知呈现。\n\n我们需要进一步剖析“去中心化”这一概念，事实上，并不存在的绝对的中心化与去中心化，从词语本身的概念理解，“去中心化”与“中心化”是一种比较语境，是某物相对于另一物的状态或形态的区分。所以，**当我们讨论权力的主体关系时，永远存在“中心化”与“去中心化”的关系呈现。**\n\n由此，但我们在讨论DAO的权力关系的去中心化与中心化关系时，就需要拎得清不同权力主体之间的关系。例如，少数人集体发起的权力决策，通过所有权的决策投票，进行将权力执行到所有成员，然而，权力诞生于DAO这个主体又同时作用于自身，这显然并不是一种真正的权力去中心化。**权力的决策与权力的执行应该由进行充分的隔离，这样的权力结构才符合去中心化的权力结构方式。**\n\n因此，在本基础结构模型当中，DAO的治理权力的制定与监督并非来自DAO本身，而是来自外部力量。\n\n### 基于去中心化治理协议的设计原则\n\n1，DAO治理的权重根据治理Token持有量进行权重衡量；\n\n2，DAO成员无法通过任何交易手段获得治理Token；\n\n3，DAO成员只能通过DAO组织的活动获得治理Token，但该治理Token不具备交易或转让等功能；\n\n4，DAO成员可以根据自己的治理Token获得外部性的权益奖励；\n\n5，获得治理代币的账号不可交易...\n\n...\n\n以上为根据基础模型的一些基本设计原则的概括，针对具体的应用案例描述，我将会在后续的案例篇中进行描述，还请期待。关于具体案例的讨论主要将在DAOs to World社群中讨论，加入方式在全文末尾。\n\n### 关于治理Token的约束与赋能\n\n治理Token的不可转让性，以及不能之间参与到任何代币交易的过程中，是为了避免治理权力与经济优势建立直接关系。治理的优先权重，不是比谁多，而是谁更具备治理的资历与能力。\n\n治理Token的赋能应该以刺激持有者的能动性参与对治理关系的改造过程当中，这里需要严谨区分，赋能不可得同于激励，但激励可以是赋能当中的一部分。\n\n对治理权力的约束要避免其他利益因素，造成权力的扭曲以及腐败，而对治理权力的赋能，是为了引导权力往符合治理诉求的正确方向前进，并构成正反馈的行动效应。\n\n## 基于去中心化治理协议的业务逻辑\n\n### DAO组织使用治理协议的流程方式\n\nDAO组织需要通过公共资产库进行影响力协议的购买进而获得使用权，当然也有可能是免费获得授权；2，其次，治理协议根据需求目的不同，使用的基础条件可能也不相同，而这此图的案例当中，治理协议是适用于特定类型的业务；\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6QtTjUqvhN78tBRC_TlEc.png?height=591&width=1080)\n\n基于协议聚合器的作用，治理协议与业务模块成为一种模块化可组合的基础设施，相关内容将在下文中重点提到。\n\n### 治理协议如何分发治理Token\n\n1，治理协议通过获得用户的交互数据，并通过协议算法进行相关Token的计量并进行分发。而治理协议分发治理token的日志数据，该数据的所有权也应当归还于用户个人。\n\n2，数据的生产日记，在某种程度上，也是DAO最重要的数据资源。在这一维度上，**DAOer就是数据的生产节点，而DAO是数据的生产工厂，但是该工厂的数据资源的产权却是归所有人共有。**\n\n### 基去中心化治理协议与数据所有权关系\n\n治理协议所涉及到的用户的原生数据都有哪些，以及决定数据将被如何使用，这些使用权利与适用边界，都是治理协议需要考虑的。而如图示例的简单比喻中，交互动作所产生的原生数据的存留，以及对原生数据的筛选使用，包括对协议使用数据后的日志数据，也应该完全交还用户数据的产权。\n\n### 基于去中心化治理协议：DAO与DAOer的关系\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7cwWjMLgBuBmhTq5ojjzm.png?height=730&width=1080)\n\n去中心化治理协议作为DAO的外部约束手段，可同时作用于其他的DAO，治理机制是复杂而专业的能力，并不是每个DAO创办者和使用者都擅长，但是具有资源条件的DAO发起人可以通过借助外部的治理协议用于DAO的治理，而治理协议又可以同时作用于其他的DAO。\n\n每一个DAOer不可能只加入一个DAO，应该同时加入多个DAO，而DAO与DAO之间因为协议的相同数量，进一步提高了DAOer在不同的DAO之间的治理效率。事实上，目前每加入一个DAO就获得一个DAO的特定的治理权力，且该治理权只能使用于一个DAO，这也是 一种中心化的特性。然而协议的共同使得在与一个DAO的治理权能可以同样适用于另外一个DAO，不仅提高了人员的流动性，也极大地降低的治理的成本，以及避免了每一个人参与某个DAO的治理权益的损失。\n\n### 基于治理协议DAO所形成的共识关系\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LdBP7I6nBR9zWmv52TRFN.png?height=365&width=1080)\n\n随着相同去中心化治理协议的应用，DAO与DAO之间采用相同的治理协议将越来越多，由此将进步形成DAO与DAO之间的共识协议，而治理协议连接了多个DAO逐步形成了DAO之间的共识强弱，**基于DAO于DAO所连成的网络进一步形成了共识网络的圈层，DAO之间的网络效应逐步形成。**\n\n## 基于去中心化治理协议的案例简述\n\n### 案例的基础角色定义\n\nDAOs to World组织：一个由众多Web3er与大量的DAO构成DAOs网络\n\n无为DAO：DAOs网络中一个提供开源治理协议的DAO\n\nWeb3er Twitter互助联盟：一个通过社交媒体创造内容并建立影响力的DAO\n\n### 去中心化治理协议的应用场景\n\nWeb3er Twitter互助联盟的DAO奉行这么与一个理念：\n\n“Web3er通过内容输出建立社交媒体网络的影响力，可以帮助内容创造者通过影响力指标，形成个人的社会资本（人脉网络的信息差/资源合作机会/受众的信任度等等），能够给自己带来更好的发展机遇和成长资源，因此影响力指标是一个比推特粉丝数据，以及抽象的知名度更加有效的指标。一个具有更高影响力的Web3er可以获得更多的权利。”\n\n那么，基于社会资本理论依据，推特上的影响力构成因素，例如这里我们可以参考推特的推文分析的关键因素\n\n*1，点赞，转发，评论*\n\n*2，展示量，参与，详情展开，*\n\n*3，新关注者，个人资料访问*\n\n这三个维度的数据指标均可以作为影响力的关键数据指标\n\n社交媒体本身是一个社交网络，剔除掉一个账号的虚假粉丝数后，一个10万真实粉丝的推特博主，和一个1千真实粉丝的推特博主，对推文的影响力权重因子将会更大。其次，再进一步设定周期的互动频率与互动指标，作为推特博主在推特的社交网络圈层。也就是通过Web3er Twitter 互助联盟的成员之间互相转发，评论，互相提升了双方的有效影响力。\n\n通过影响力协议的我们就可以得出一个推特博主的影响力系数，无论是单条推文或者是个人账号。当然，随着对数据分析的理解以及影响力需求分析的理解，影响力治理协议也将得到进一步的发展，或者因为价值理念的不同，这些数据的不同组合使用，被定义为声誉协议，贡献协议等等；\n\n当无为DAO根据DAOs to World组织的普遍需求，开源了影响力治理协议，声誉治理协议，贡献治理协议等等，这些治理协议就可以被不同的DAOs组织采用。因此在这个案例中，Web3er Twitter 互助联盟的影响力治理协议，就不会是联盟自己制定并自己执行。而是通过成员公开投票，选择一个公认的影响力治理协议，而这个影响力就是无为DAO开源提供的，专门作用于基于社交媒体影响力的治理协议。\n\n### 去中心化治理协议的经济优势\n\n影响力协议规则，可以通过具体的数据指标而定义，那就意味着我们可以从推特上的活动更加真实地获得一个Web3er的真实影响力，进而为其发布治理Token，并通过治理协议的规则约定，对基于内容影响力的生产力起到了\n\n例如：\n\n*1，影响力治理协议规定，发布推文或者影响力系数10分的，奖励10个影响力治理Token，*\n\n*2，影响力治理Token是通过生产性活动产生的，无法通过其他渠道购买治理Token，且不可转让；*\n\n*3，具有治理Token的Web3er，可以消耗治理Token兑换推特互助DAO合作项目的白名单，或者其他*\n\n治理Token的无法转让限制，也让具有真实影响力的Web3er能够做出符合影响力价值理念的投票决策；\n\n### 去中心化治理协议的网络优势\n\n如果两个不同的DAO也采用了同样的影响力治理协议，那就意味着两个DAO之间在影响力的业务合作得以遵循同一个共识，可以通过智能合约完成业务合作。其次，因为采用了同一套治理协议，那么就意味着当Web3 Twitter 互助联盟的成员可以带着自己的影响力治理token以及影响力权益，进入到另一个采用同一共识的DAO参与建设。\n\n而当DAOs to World组织的其他DAO也采用了同一套影响力治理协议时，那就意味着Web3er的治理Token与影响力权益有了更大的使用场景，可以更加自由地进入各种各样的DAO参与贡献而不会被白嫖。当越来越多的DAO出现在DAOs to World，越来越多的去中心化治理协议被创造，那么治理框架的通用议事规则也会诞生，其目的用于平衡DAO和个人与群体的权利。\n\n例如：\n\n*意见占多数者，即多数方的权利；*\n\n*意见占少数者，即少数方的权利，特别是对于占总人数少于1/2但大于1/3的所谓“强少数方”的权利；*\n\n*每个成员的权利*\n\n*“缺席者”的权利*\n\n*所有上述人群作为一个整体的权利；*\n\n在提案与投票的治理流程上，我们也会形成一套合理通用的去中心化的治理框架。\n\n例如：\n\n*1，根据奥威尔1984制度协议规定，为了尊重个人主权的意志，以及对抗极端集权的垄断式统治危机，任何人都将可以发起DAO的分叉提案；*\n\n*2，根据罗伯特议事协议规定，分叉方案的利益相关人，超过1/3的赞同即可实现DAO的分叉，并启动分叉相关的协议流程；*\n\n*3，...*\n\n### DAO的发展需要去中心化治理机制\n\n\\*\\*DAO的治理机制应该通过治理协议实现开放式的，去中心化，自由化的基本原则。\\*\\*只有基于DAOs网络的去中心化治理协议与去中心化治理框架的存在，DAO才能得以真正实现。DAO的治理机制应该是去中心化的治理机制，而去中心化的治理机制主要由去中心化的治理协议与去中心化的治理框架构成。随着治理需求的发展，去中心化的治理机制也将逐渐迭代。\n\n现阶段当一个DAO成员离开一个DAO，不仅不能够带走自身的劳动产权证明，还无法将自己所积累的治理贡献带走。这种做法非常不合理，不符合Web3产权回归价值观。\n\n关于更加具体详细案例讲解与分析：包括治理协议与DAO之间的文化系统，经济模型，以及治理协议的具体设计；相关内容将重点在DAOs toWorld的社群优先分享。(加入方式请看本文结尾\n\n## 第四部分：新生\n\n## DAOs网络的结构特征与资本主义演化\n\n### 资本文明的地理与文化环境\n\n> “欧洲这种竞争性的文化性格的形成，与欧洲地理环境的多样性，以及地势之支离破碎直接有关。更具体地说，欧洲存在着山地，丘陵，平原和曲折多变的海岸区域，生活于这些不同地理环境的人，发展出不同的生活方式，包括不同的经济生活、语言、宗教，形成多元的民族。地理环境的差异性，形成生活方式与民族的差异性，他们很难融合成同一民族、他们只能在竞争中求得生存发展。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n欧洲因为其地理环境所演化的社会形态，使得其难以形成统一民族，即地区身份的集体认同感，欧洲的地理因素注定其分裂与竞争是常态。而欧洲之所以能够形成以基督教文明为主体信仰，又在于基督教是作为一种超越的信仰得以成为欧洲的主体文化。民族竞争性与统一文化信仰，是欧洲之所以诞生资本主义社会形态的历史背景。\n\n### 资本制度的竞争性形成原因\n\n> “新制度主义经济学家提出这样一种简明的解释：欧洲地理的多样性，有利于形成独立的小国家或小共同体，有些小国家的统治者为了强化自己的竞争能力，通过无数次的尝试，逐渐形成这样的一些新的办法：采取吸引具有资本、技能和知识的人才政策，来增强自己的生产能力与财富。为了保护与留住资本与人才，他们进而发展出一套有效地、稳定地保护工商业、私有产权、个人创新自主性的制度环境。\n>\n> 例如威尼斯，热亚那，佛罗伦萨，尼德兰可以源源不断地吸引越来越多的资本与人才，从而使资本、人才、技术、劳动力结合起来，造成经济的进一步繁荣与国力的强盛。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n此处做进一步的描述补充：独立国家或者共同体的真正的竞争力体现在：通过一套保护私有产权以及个人创新自主性（也就是个人能动性）的社会制度，这套制度能够将资本、人才、技术和劳动力结合起来，形成一个良性的社会氛围。而这恰恰就是今天的我们，对于DAO的发展最为关键的诉求。\n\n### 资本主义的自我更新与演化\n\n> “这种资本主义的文化特点是：通过法律制度来保护私有产权，个人自由，无需特许的投资；另一方面，由商业派生出来的道德与价值观也逐渐在这种制度环境中发展出来——商人们学会了守时，诚实、以礼待人与守信用‘政府学会了按法律约束自己，不敢为所欲为，政府与公民双方都在这一互动过程中自我更新。\n>\n> 这种建立起资本主义性质新制度的国家数量不断扩大，最后达到了整个欧洲国家总数的临界多数，整个欧洲也由量变到质变，从封建社会演化为资本主义社会，欧洲各国的封建政治体制，逐步转向君子立宪政体和选举民主政体。\n>\n> 资本主义并不是预先根据某种理性原则的人为设计，而是人类在无意识的试错与适应环境过程中演变过来的。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n\\*\\*正是多个共同体之间的互相竞争，形成了一套自我更新的“互动结构”，\\*\\*而这套结构是保护了价值观对经济秩序的约束，例如商人的守时守信才能促进经济的良好发展。所以，正是具有自我更新能力的互动结构，通过其流动性的竞争力逐步扩大这一制度的共识，最终改变了欧洲社会的结构，推动了社会制度的全面改革。这正是DAO与DAO之间的竞争性也将必然上演的演化过程，而这个演化过程也必然是，共同体的自上而下推进制度创新，而全局整体性的自下而上的竞争演化。\n\n### 自主个体的用脚投票与优势流动\n\n> “共同体的小规模、分散性、自主性，有助于形成文化变异。更具体地说，只要一个社会板块中存在着分散的、独立自主的个体，这些个体总要竭尽自己的智能，追求自身的利益最大化，总是要运用自己可以独立支配的各种资源与潜能，来争取更好的存活机会，来应对复杂多变的环境挑战。\n>\n> 其次，小共同体彼此边界的开放性，有助于自主个体的横向流动性，正是这种跨政区的流动性，使得具有良好效能的小共同体的制度环境，对其他地区的个体具有更多的吸引力，自主的个体可以携带自己的优势竞争势能，通过用脚投票的权利，聚集到对自己更有利的地区去。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n实际上，这种人才根据自身诉求自由流动加入各种小共同体，正是当前DAO的发展所需要条件，而目前阻碍这个条件发生了，在于DAO的封闭性，以及无法携带自身优势与资源，进入到有利于自己的地区。所以，DAOs网络的存在，实际上就是对DAO的去中心化呈现。\n\n### 资本主义文明演化的七个重要的结构条件\n\n> “小规模性、多元性、分散性、个体自主性、流动性、边界开放性，以及在上述结构因素基础上的竞争性，是竞争性文明演化的重要结构条件，也是资本主义文明演化最为重要的结构条件。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n处于DAO发展早期，我们可以参考借鉴早期资本主义得以发展的关键因素，即\\*\\*“小规模化、多元化、分散性、流动性、个体自主性、边界开放性、自由竞争性“\\*\\*这几大核心因素。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M_qjH47NVIH86Mx88rHyd.png?height=274&width=934)\n\n当然，并不是我们要在DAOs进一步发展资本主义，而是去其糟粕取其精华，首先实现DAO在Web3阶段的突破性进化。每一个DAO即为一个小的共同体，那么DAO与DAO之间的从点到面的网络结构的特征以及性质，是我们现阶段可以借鉴的历史经验。\n\n## DAOs网络的协议与业务结构关系\n\n### 去中心化协议支撑去中心化业务活动\n\nDAOs网络如何支撑各种活动实践，其基础是由去中心化治理协议所组成的去中心化协议网络。\n\n而在此之上，我认为应该建立三大关键的业务网络，去中心化的社交网络，去中心化的协作网络，去中心化的交易网络，通过这些开放性的网络来形成从资本到生产的去中心化的业务活动网络，这就是DAOs网络的网络结构。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WpVHizwkw8rvU094qqG1O.png?height=545&width=1080)\n\n实际上，去中心化的信息流，去中心化的任务流，以及去中心化的资金流，将作为一种模块化的功能组件实现业务的交互，也是对应胖协议的胖模块，因为在去中心化的网络结构当中，类似App等中心集成的架构形态将会改变，取而代之的便是去中心化的模块应用体现，而在当前交互硬件以手机为主流载体的时代，那么以Feeds为主要交互模式的流系胖模块将会是不可避免的趋势。\n\n而DAPP的功能架构成更多成为一个兼容多种业务模块，可灵活插拔的框架，而针对协议聚合器则将成为管理与分发在不同业务网络的协议枢纽。**这种具有天然汇聚资源能力的枢纽，必定是兵家必争之地。**\n\n## DAOs网络的去中心化协议聚合器\n\n### DAOs治理协议聚合器的作用\n\n随着一个DAO的大量实践的发展，那么一个DAO将同时发展出多条并行的业务线，并且每个业务线的业务模块都有不同的治理协议，这个时候，治理协议聚合器便发挥了关键的作用。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AJLx19dYUgAuh9hQfTPYH.png?height=699&width=1080)\n\n无论是DAO还是DAOer，协议聚合器将统一管理DAO所涉及到的业务活动相关的协议，协议聚合器不仅包括了活动业务相关的协议，也包括了治理制度相关的协议。\n\n例如，当前不少社区所采取的投票制度与投票流程规章，我们可以定义为罗伯特议事协议，而针对于DAO成员在业务活动过程中所获得数据产权关系，即所有权的保护协议，我们可以采用大陆法产权协议。\n\n协议聚合器有效地实现了DAO与DAO之间的协议兼容性，由此可以实现，DAO与DAO之间进行业务合作，抵押借贷，人员迁移等，由此，我们将实现DAO的去中心化发展与演化逻辑。\n\n在DAOs网络当中，必然存在一些特殊的DAO进行DAOs网络流通的各种治理协议的研究，评测以及改进咨询，并为其他DAO提供合适其自身发展的治理框架以及治理协议。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nwmrzyt3RUVwlcAwvlWi6.png?height=502&width=1080)\n\n\\*\\*这就意味着DAO的去中心化权力关系的制定机构的出现，而该机构不涉及到任何协议的执行过程，\\*\\*去中心化的权力决策辅助机构的出现，意味着DAOs网络的权力关系中，决策权与执行权的分离，使得去中心化的权力关系得以实现。\n\n### DAOs治理协议聚合器：DAO劳动者的自由移民\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JMgjngdmSMR9ZYsuaOhgQ.png?height=1250&width=1080)\n\nDAO协议聚合器的出现，通过协议的兼容性与治理框架的同一性，实现了DAOer在不同的DAO之间可以自由的进入并且参与不同的业务活动，且自身所积累的治理优势也将得以保留。\n\n这就是去中心化治理协议在DAOs网络当中得以应用的优势，由此该模式解决了当前DAO的参与者获得真正的自由。\n\n### DAOs治理协议聚合器：DAO如何自由公平地分叉\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wXhw2nbaqEZqU_F0dlOwy.png?height=786&width=1080)\n\nDAO的分叉是共识的分叉，而分叉的关键就是协议聚合器的重新配置。其中，治理框架的制度协议是分叉的关键，\n\n例如：\n\n1. 根据奥威尔1984制度协议规定，为了尊重个人主权的意志，以及对抗极端集权的垄断式统治危机，任何人都将可以发起DAO的分叉提案；\n2. 根据罗伯特议事协议规定，分叉方案的利益相关人，超过1/3的赞同即可实现DAO的分叉，并启动分叉相关的协议流程；\n3. 根据大陆法产权协议，保护分叉任意双方的数据所有权，并秉持尽可能的所有权原则，公共资产需要根据所有权协议进行重新的分配\n\n由此，基于去中心化治理协议的DAO分叉活动，将完整保护了利益相关方的资产利益，而协议聚合器的存在，又将使得DAO的合并兼容提供了可行性。\n\n因为，基于去中心化治理协议的协议聚合器，在DAOs网络当中，起到了举足轻重的作用，也是未来DAOs网络建设当中，重要的资源枢纽，甚者比交易所还要更加重要。\n\n## 基于开放式Loot范式的可组合NFTs\n\n### 基于Loot范式的NFTs业务拓展方式\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7WEWGbM-su8AdRMPhwE6.png?height=701&width=1080)\n\n随着基础业务的拓展，与业务相关的治理协议也需要跟着业务的拓展而拓展，例如一个核心业务模块，由于用户规模以及业务细分的发展趋势，会进一步形成围绕核心业务的多个子业务出现，面对这一需求，我们可以通过Loot范式的组合NFTs来实现。\n\n正如图中示例，在去中心化的社交媒体随着业务的发展，进一步拓展出主题推文讨论，内容共创，以及创作激励等， 不同的业务模块在功能交互层面存在不同的数据类型，由此治理协议与交互数据形成新的子协议进行治理。\n\n根据不同子协议所定义的NFT作用与权益，例如人气王，敏捷，赏金猎人-铂金等不同的定义，形成了影响力NFTs的集合，并在NFTs的聚合器当中体现。\n\n### 基于Loot范式的可拓展协议业务流程\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-JMhePDJvedEPrOOMyBfr.png?height=979&width=1080)\n\n随着用户在业务网络的各种活动需求，在不同业务模块当中所产生的数据，都可以经过数据产权协议进行权益的划分，例如数据的使用权，租赁权或抵押权等等。\n\n数据本身作为一种原料资源，需要经过业务加工，协议赋权，才能得以在整个生产关系网络当中发挥价值。需要重点关注的是，治理协议赋予了元数据的产权权利，而治理协议的规则定义，则是对产权形成了赋能与约束的作用。\n\n正如相比于传统的网文平台对创作者做签订的不平等条约，基于DAOs网络的产权协议将彻底保障作者内容的所有权，以及后续 一系列的商业变现，本质都是对其内容权利的商业变现。\n\n这就是Web3数据所有权回归运动当中，数据实现价值变现的关键所在。而一切真正Web3的金融模型与商业模式，也都将建立在以此基础之上。\n\n### 基于Loot范式的NFTs协议聚合器\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2hN2BQOT8HQJthtx_xhfA.png?height=611&width=1080)\n\n由于子业务的扩展，那么协议聚合器也将进一步兼容业务的扩容需求，基于Loot范式的NFTs协议聚合器，将包括子业务的协议，子业务的NFT，子业务的治理Token，以及子业务的元数据。\n\n而基于该模式的协议聚合器，具有极大的潜力，我们将在下文进一步探讨。\n\n### Loot范式的解析：再生产结构的二重性\n\nLoot是一种基于文本结构的NFT，其特点是纯文字通过字段的符号定义，通过社区的想象力得以实现自下而上的演化与发展，而基于可组合协议的NFT，即多个NFT可以组合成为一个NFT，在这里定义为NFTs。\n\n基于Loot范式的NFTs意味着Loot文本结构中的标签可以是组合性，而不是再是随机性的，进一步则意味着文本结构与标签的可扩展性，我们可以通过这个功能结构建立一套链上的语义以及符号系统。\n\n在原本的Loot范式中，Loot是随机生成的固定的“文本就结构与字符内容”，而社区的创作者们从故事表达上，可以通过个人或集体的想象力以及创造力，构建了Lootverse(loot元宇宙），当Loot与程序化艺术生成结合时，**Loot本质就是一个链上交互指令的脚本，通过符号系统实现了对想象世界的构建。**\n\n这一过程，实际上形成了，**客观经验世界与主观意向世界，通过交互媒介实现，具体与抽象的互相建设，这一过程实际上可称为建构的二重性，即loot的生产结构二重性。**\n\n### Loot范式的重构：语义符号的离散随机系统\n\n符号系统是一种离散随机系统，而Loot范式的符号系统却是停滞的，因此会导致底层涌现的动力不足。\n\nloot范式是一个封闭的，且有限的符号系统，其原因在于无法新增新的根符号与根字段，而在原来的设计理念中，也缺乏外部性的条件实现对根符号与根字段的添加。\n\n虽然可以通过版本迭代的方式，实现对符号字段的新增，但符号系统的演化过程是一个动态发展随机系统，因此需要找到一个合理的外部生产条件来实现其根结构的可发展性。\n\n而基于去中心化治理协议的子业务，基于Loot范式的NFTs生产结构为打开Loot范式原本的桎梏提供了可能，由此我们得以彻底激活Loot范式的真正潜力。\n\nLoot规范的标签类型可扩展，字段符号的可扩展，层级叠加的扩展，总而言之，基于开放式Loot范式的可组合NFTs协议系统，使得我们得以实现**链上原生的语义符号的离散随机系统，我们将真正获得涌现的力量。**\n\n### 基Loot范式的NFTs如何形成文化秩序\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m68wE9UbBmUzgziVCnhh9.png?height=485&width=1080)\n\n关于文化对社会秩序的影响，我们可以考古到远古部落时期，祭祀仪式的作为一种原始信仰的统治，而随着封建王朝的出现，祭祀仪式逐渐转互为一种约束行为的“礼”的道德治理手段。\n\n**文化秩序是社会管理的最高准则**，一切法律的制定都要依据社会道德的公约。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kzc6xOLKwh91I7vTb2V9z.png?height=684&width=1080)\n\n语言作为文化传播与发展的重要符号，即作为一种人与人之间进行交流的沟通媒介，文化通过符号媒介出现，但其本身存在于集体的“语言共同体”当中，频繁的交流动作，相当于持续地丰富“共有知识库”，以及优化沟通表达的“阐释框架”的表达效率，进而将原本抽象而模糊的情境表达，逐步提炼成为具体的符号动作。\n\n群体共有的文化是整体共识的体现，共有知识是共识的全部因素，阐释框架是共识的表达形式，Loot范式的NFTs的文本符号表达结构，承载了“诠释框架”的功能，而随着业务拓展的而持续增加的符号字段，成为集体的共有知识，在发生业务的情境与交互当中持续发展。\n\n下面讲举例一个文化案例的体现\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kM5K55coBAlYmVipoRSmc.png?height=715&width=1080)\n\n仁、义、礼是儒家文化的精髓，而这三者之间的关系是：“仁”是内心的德性；“义”是形式的义务；“礼”是外在的规范；“仁”是你内心的道德品质；“义”是你去做道德上应该做的事情；“礼”是一套制约你行为的社会伦理规范通过这个文化互动模型的结构合并，我们可以看到儒家文化，是如何通过该互动结构得以实现一种文化具象的呈现，而NFTs上所呈现的每一个字段，又将通过治理协议与交互媒介，融入到整个DAOs网络的治理过程当中。\n\n**文化通过结构的二重性，在持续形成结构化的过程中，实现了与真实客观实现的持续交互与经验映射。**\n\n我们时常谈“仁义”道德，实际上是“仁”与“义”的两个思想种子的融合，形成了我们日常情境与广泛语义上的一种儒家道德观。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0MnKpQWBS5NJwcO5L4o9Z.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n随着“仁”与“义”在现实场景中的不断交互与相容，我们在逐渐形成“仁义”的道德理念，并通过文化符号展现出来。由于该文字符号都是基于协议的交互规则的定义体现，因此仁，义，乃至仁义的相关动作都可以获得治理Token，也就说，在业务设计足够合理的情况下，我们定义了仁义道德的行为，并由此赋予相应的对象，获得相关的不可转让的治理权力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MYdfEfkGr5sqcpii2rkCw.png?height=681&width=1080)\n\n当然，这仅仅是一个例子，事实上，随着这套机制与系统的完善，我们会看到更多文化治理的思想得以应用。总而言之，通过开放性的Loot范式的组合NFTs与结构的二重性，我们在客观经验世界的文化道德得以进入数字世界并得到演化。\n\n通过以上结构与模型，我们解决了兼容了文化道德的，根据DAO自身的共识需求而得到实现的文化秩序的道德治理。\n\n### 基于Loot范式的NFTs实现VIBE的可创造性\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i1L0m4bcoPPuOXCo0IOlK.png?height=698&width=1080)\n\n通过我们对文化治理协议的结构与模式探讨，我们可以获得一种定义VIBE的视野，即**VIBE是对特定的符号动作进行大量的有效实践**，而同时作为一种可被观察到的文化叙事的实践方式的过程，所呈现的一种可被感知的状态。\n\nVIBE的内在特征是促进并提升个体的能动性，使得治理协议的交互媒介得到最大化的使用，进而大量获得与使用治理Token，其中，NFTs的作为阐释框架在不同情境的生成过程，是VIBE作为被可具体观察到的过程状态的截面。\n\n由此，VIBE不再是虚无缥缈的感知氛围，而是可以通过具体手段与明确监测到的一种可持续创造现象。\n\n## 第五部分：机遇\n\n## 基于DAOs网络的去中心化商业模式\n\n### 构建产权分配的经济共同体\n\n从过去的社会经济的发展经验中，例如土地产权的制度，从集体生产所有到家庭承包责任制，极大地改变了土地生产粮食的效率以及个体的劳动盈余。而一个DAO的经济模型的设计，必然离不开其产权制度的设计，一个缺乏产权制度的DAO是不完整的，产权制度是对共同劳动结果的确权保障，由此，产权残缺的经济模型必然会导致生产性活动的降低。\n\n不可能所有的DAO都是投资DAO，而公共资产管理也仅仅是DAO的主要功能之一，Web3的DAO需要将劳动力资源尽可能导向生产性的活动，以此提高Web3的正外部性以及DAO的可持续发展的经济绩效。\n\n**产权制度与经济模型，两者是一体化的经济系统**，这是DAO真正有效开启生产性活动且能够长期运营的关键所在。缺少产权制度的DAO，仅仅是获得薪酬的DAO，对于大多数人而言，那经济效益甚至不如加入一家公司；\n\n### 解决X2Earn与Xfi的产权残缺\n\n目前大量打着Web3旗号的Xfi与X2E项目，这类项目的经济模型，本质上是庞氏经济模型与Staking经济的融合变种，缺乏对用户数据所有权的价值体现，缺乏对用户数据产权的有效激励，Web3的主旨是产权回归，不符合这个主旨的都不是Web3项目。\n\nX2E与XFi的有效正外部性是什么？我一直认为这是一个好问题。一个经济体的有效正外部性，一定是源自于发生了更多的生产性活动，以及外部市场的交易活动。X2E与XFi项目的弊端源自于以代币价值为核心，而非以生产价值为核心。一旦注入项目的资金被抽离市值暴跌，那么用户本质就是被割的韭菜，实际上事实也如此。\n\n基于Loot范式的可组合NFTs有助于将业务流程与相关数据进行确权并让用户具有产权的自主分离权能，进一步将自身的数据租赁给平台或者其他。而**目前典型的X2E与XFi项目中，是默认占据了所有权的所有权能，用户仅仅只获得其抵押的激励收益。**\n\n### 基于DAO治理协议的经济模型\n\n数据作为Web3的核心资源，数据资源的产权制度是Web3经济模型的根基，所以，在设计Web3的商业模型时，需要同时兼容“产权制度—经济模型-商业模式”的一体化结构。\n\n基于loot范式的组合NFTs来实现产权的分配，在每一个项目的发起时，需要具体划分每一个参与决策需要承担的工作内容，并确定其权重比例。当相关角色正式参与到项目活动中，该角色即可获得代表该产权的NFTs，无论是空投还是mint。\n\n参与者的劳动结果要基于该NFTs进行确权上链，并根据工作结果获得该NFTs的治理代币，而该代币可用于权益经济的激励。除去特殊的文化治理的不可转让的NFT，产权NFTs与经济模型的集合，使得NFTs获得了价值捕获以及更大的流动性。\n\n例如，当一个项目获得较高市场关注度时且具有未来可预期的现金流，那么产权所有者可以将自身的NFTs的收益权分离为一组NFT进行租赁或者抵押。Loot范式的可组合NFTs与协议聚合器让个人掌握了产权与经济变现的主动权。将NFTs进行子NFT的分离并与经济权益挂钩，例如购买具有收益权的NFTs，每固定周期即可获得一定的收益回报，既可以是代币，也可以是权益。\n\n## 基于DAOs网络的个人发展机会\n\n### 设计自己的工作流\n\n实际上，在DAOs网络当中，你将是为了自己而工作，因为你所生产的数据在产权治理协议的保护下，将成为你个人重要的资产，这些资产本身能够给你带来持续的收益。由于DAOs网络的去中心化的优势，DAO的NFTs聚合器的出现，使得我们可以自由参与到多个DAO的劳动生产当中，产权协议保护下的生产力流动性，是DAOs网络一个极具优势的特征。\n\n由于**你将来是面向DAOs网络提供劳动价值，因此你将可以设计自己的工作流，并将该流程模块化**，工作流程的模块化意味着你可以将你的生产力得到更多分散的机会，使得你的收益渠道是一种结构性的收入，而不是单一渠道的收入。\n\n对于个人而言，基于Loot范式的NFTs将使得你的劳动生产获得投资的可能。例如你要创作一部小说，你可以通过NFTs进行具体产权的分离，你将可以发行多个具有收益权的NFTs用于写作的投资，而获得NFTs的投资人也将获得你未来小说发行，以及影视改版等商业收入，你与NFTs持有者将形成利益共同体，并成为一个DAO的组织形态。\n\n在Loot范式的可组合NFTs这一模型下，设计自己的工作流等于设计自己的商业模式，**个人也许将成为一个超级商业个体**，设想哈利波特的作者JK罗琳假如采用了这套模式，也许她个人就是一个比肩传媒巨头的超级商业个体。\n\n每个人都将得以探索属于自己的职业路线，这样的未来很值得期待。\n\n### 个人产权的投资布局\n\nDAOs网络改变了传统的劳动雇佣关系，这也意味着薪酬革命的到来。你在DAOs网络的劳动不仅获得货币作为劳动报酬，更重要是你所参与的劳动的产权凭证以及未来的收益潜力，才是你重要而财富来源。\n\n传统公司制度的股票和期权在没上市前就空气和泡沫，而能够成功上市的企业并维持良好市值的实在稀疏可数，所以传统公司制度早已不满足现代人的工作收益需求，当缺乏更好地通过劳动获得财富滚雪球复利效应的渠道时，人们就会涌向投机市场，进一步形成了经济泡沫。\n\n基于DAOs网络的产权基于协议的流动性，具有了经济网络的规模效应，这为个人产权提供了新的增长市场，基于DAOs网络的经济规模效应，个人的产权如同股票一样，具有了投资回报的经济效益。\n\n所以，当我们决定参与到某个DAO的项目时，也要考虑评估其在产权分配上，你所能够获得的权益NFT，该权益的收益权的时效，以及是否可交易等，这些都成为重要的评估条件，而缺乏劳动产权制度DAO则成为失去优秀人才的参与。\n\n**当你投身某个DAO的劳动时，你的劳动产权就开始了铸造**，NFTs聚合器也将成为你管理劳动产权收益的主要工具。\n\n### 影响力即共识，共识即品牌\n\n尽可能构建个人影响，获得更多的共识，是个人品牌价值最大化的方式。而在DAOs网络当中，个人影响力的构建不再是虚假繁荣的指标，有效的影响力将通过各种影响力协议实现数据的跟踪与确权，进而获得相关的治理Token，影响力将成为个人有效的共识体现，意味着获得在DAOs网络的各种权益优势。\n\n个人可以发行自己的NFTs，建立自己影响力人脉网络，我认为这也是DAOs网络存在可能性机遇，这也将完全颠覆了过往以雇佣方与公司利益为主体的商业体系。一切都在朝着超级个体的方向发展。\n\n## 基于DAOs网络的社群发展模式\n\n### 社群与社区的区别\n\nCrypto的社区顺理成章地成为DAO的发育土壤，然而我们还是十分有必要区分，社群与社区的区分。\n\n相比于社区，社群是人员结构扁平的组织，在主题明确的交流环境下，人群具有更高的互动交流的频率，在以IM功能结构的互联网环境中，社群往往是社区的组成单位。如果从功能呈现上来说，**社区相比于社群更多时候是一个抽象整体但边界清晰的存在**，因为社区的核心是身份认同的归属感，这也是很多社区发行PFP的原因，但是真正的身份认同感并非来自于花钱每一个身份证，而是源自于所处环境在文化活动上的密切交流。\n\n实际上，在目前的社交产品当中，社群才是支撑人群在网络交流互动的主要渠道。对于中国地区的网民来说，相比于社区文化，我们拥有最佳的社群文化的土壤，社群文化才是构成我们生活与工作的重要部分，所以，当我们在讨论DAO与社区的发展关系时，其实DAO与社群可能是更优的发展关系。\n\n### 社群在互动结构上的优势\n\n社群在人员的互动结构上有着极大的优势，因为每一个成员都共享一个IM的聊天窗，这不仅意味着聊天的全程透明化，而其他的协同例如转账，接龙等群功能的展示是直观的。\n\n这种交互功能上的扁平化，形成了群友在活动执行上的互动结构的扁平化，这种扁平化的优势在交流效率与传递效率上远比社区高很多，其次高频次的交流更有助于文化氛围的形成，而无需刻意采取品牌影响的方式经营社区品牌文化。\n\n社群的功能结构更有助于小群体的紧密联系，而未来的DAO的生产性活动还是以小群体为主流，无论是因为链上性能限制，还是线上协同，敏捷有默契的小团队文化会是DAO主流规模。\n\n### 社群是DAO的最佳启动方式\n\n社群的扁平互动结构是DAO的天然土壤，每一社群都可以天生成为一个DAO，无论是交流还是活动的协同，相比于庞大复杂的社区拥有着更大的灵活优势。因为在DAOs网络当中，劳动者主要面向DAOs网络服务获得并积累个人产权与资产，DAO的功能形态更加适应了灵活自由的协同方式，意味着可以和DAOs网络上，采用相同治理协议的劳动者进行自由灵活的组队，形成一个围绕项目生产的DAO，项目结束后即可解散，而基于NFTs的治理协议与产权证明又可以灵活地随时将其召回。\n\n社群如何建立共识并凝聚价值，这个才是社群进阶成为DAO的关键所在。简单描述下，基于Loot范式的可组合NFTs是如何实现一个社群的共识凝聚以及可持续发展。\n\n*1，在Loot的NFTs的功能定义，确定身份标签，根据生产技能划分身份职能；*\n\n*2，一个社群可能有多次活动以及每次活动有多个业务，那么进一步添加项目标签与任务标签；*\n\n*3，制定一个治理Token的分配制度，从任务权重以及任务完成度作为核心考虑，治理Token为不可转让因此不具备数字货币的功能，仅作为治理权重转化经济权益的计量指标，因此符合法律规定并不是发行数字货币。*\n\n*4，治理Token本身具有可编程功能，因此可以随着投票共识决定往什么方向升级；*\n\n*5，建立Loot范式的NFTs知识库，该知识库作为NFTs的功能定义，以及业务活动的相关规则的记录等等，每个标签，每个字段的含义等等，并确权上链进行开源。*\n\n\\*6，建立一套基于该NFTs知识库的阐释框架，根据该阐述框架可以决定哪些字段标签组合而成的NFTs具备哪些职能以及权利；\n\\*\n\n完成以上的关键步骤，一方面解决了DAO参与者的产权制度，其次共有知识与诠释框架的设计，该NFTs将同时具有产权价值，协议功能，以及社群互动过程的文化属性；这样的使得治理协议的规则约定可以根据业务情况进行调整，也大大提高了治理的容错率。\n\n基于这个治理结构的设计流程，再进一步采用各种投票工具，或者治理的规则约定，例如需要具备哪些条件的成员获得什么样的投票资格，这些就是目前业内普遍常用的治理工具了。\n\n总结来说，目前DAO的治理工具与治理规则缺乏了基础底层的支撑，进而造成了因为业务发展脱离早期治理的规则时，都不可避免面临发展的困境。\n\n## 第七部分：参与\n\n## DAOs构建全球去中心化的协同网络\n\nDAOs几乎聚合了Web3所有的关键技术，或者某种程度上来说，我认为DAOs网络才是Web3得以真正发展建设的方向，DID为我们提供了DAOs网络的自由身份，去中心化治理协议实现了去中心化制度管理，NFTs的普及与应用得以让产权资源在DAOs网络当中实现价值捕获。\n\n我们一直都认可DAO是人类协同的新方式，我们也希望DAOs网络是全人类的协同网络，DAOs网络应该是自由的，公平的，开放的，全球每个人都可以在DAOs网络当中自由地工作。\n\nDAOs网络将永久性地改变全球的劳动力市场，全球化的自由协同意味着基于全球加密经济的市场规模因为生产力的介入而得到爆发性的增长，当全球几十亿人都在DAOs网络自由地就业，同时还能保护个人的数据产权，或许这将诞生新的经济体系。\n\n## 发展中国家制定符合DAO发展的法律\n\n如果你在当前的法律框架中探讨DAO的合规性发展，你会发现基本无解。\\*\\*难道因为各国政策法律的规定，比特币就得改成合规比特币吗？比特币还是那个比特币。\\*\\*我们最好的方式是说服某个国家或者地区，延续采用阿连德政府关于控制论的社会主义制度，而这一次我们采用的是DAOs的应用模式，其治理协议就是法律条文在DAOs的应用体现。如果我们局限于DAO与公司制的等同实体，那么狭隘的视野就会造成目前大多数DAO所面临的困境。\n\nDAO的真正先驱与领导者，捍卫DAO的去中心化而迟迟不做法律实体的绑定，并不在于合规化的操作不能，而是在于这些决策将会导致DAO完全往另一个方向发展，具有公司法律实体的DAO本质是DAC——去中心化的自治公司。DAC与DAO是两个不同的物种，**当你在现有法律框架进行DAO合规性时，那严谨说辞应该是，一个DAO转型做了DAC**。你不能再自称作为一个DAO，退下吧！\n\n目前可看到的关于DAO合规性的文章基本千篇一律，未来几年大概也是如此。\n\nDAO的真正合规性的发展路线，是基于DAOs网络将法律条文逐步通过治理协议实现。DAOs网络是全球化的网络，那么国际法纳入DAOs网络的治理协议，才是DAO的合规化方向。这就是我们为何需要在落后的发展中国家寻求合规化的探索。第三世界才是我们的探索DAO合规化的真正出路。\n\n**农村包围城市，同志们！**\n\n## 全球发展中国家的制度改革浪潮兴起\n\n我们从互联网的数据奴隶解放成为数据的产权所有者，Web3的产权回归运动通过DAOs网络，让大量的数据无产阶级成为数据的有产阶级。而产权意识的兴起，也将让劳动者选择有利于自己的劳动力市场，逐步抛弃原本旧的经济制度。\n\n所有权共同体以及去中心化治理协议的应用，极大地约束并降低了资本对无产阶级的剥削力度，自由资本市场的经济规则或许将得到改写，构建自主产权的新兴经济体将成为新的世界浪潮。基于Web3思想的数字经济制度，将不再按照互联网巨头所塑造的数字资本主义的经济制度。\n\nDAOs网络的形成势必形成新的产权经济制度，发展中国家为了获得更具优势的经济竞争力，将比发达国家更有动力进行经济制度的改革，乃至社会制度的改革。加密货币席卷了全球金融证券市场，而DAOs网络则将彻底席卷全球的劳动生产力市场。\n\n## 探索新生文明：元宇宙原生社会形态\n\nDAOs构建了一个社会系统的基本雏形，从身份认同，加密货币，任务协同包括文化系统等等，我们逐步实现了现实社会与数字社会的融合，并兼容了我们广义上的宗教，政治，经济等等，我们通过技术力量实现了一种原生的社会形态，开启了人类赖以生存的新的疆域。\n\n对于Metaverse的原生社会形态，既是我们现有一切社会学的整合，也是一切“元社会学”的起点，因为在过去的社会学当中，理性的现实主义的学者大多洞察现实社会的根本规律，然而在Metaverse的社会理念中，**浪漫的人文主义也许将会大放光彩**，文化通过符号的视觉呈现，基于文化的可再创造系统，精神世界对物质世界的大融合，人类的文明会有更多全新的故事涌现。\n\n## DAOs to World的使命愿景\n\n### DAOs to World是一个超越社区的发展共同体\n\n在全球一百多个国家/地区，建设以Web3产权保护制度为核心的DAOs网络，变革自工业革命以来，以控制论与旧制度资本主义所创造的现代化劳动分工市场，打破以全球自由资本主义制度所控制的全球经济秩序。我们将帮助大量落后的，以及发展中国家/地区的人民，**摆脱资本对其剩余价值的剥削**，以及对其劳动生产能力的异化。\n\n我们将守护全球50亿人口拥有自由的身份进入未来数字社会的身份权利，**让更多无产阶级成为有产阶级，进而实现真正意义上的“自由的，平等的，正义的”**，我们将避免数字资本主义所缔造的赛博朋克意识形态，实现对人类数字文明社会的控制，即通过巨大的数字利维坦巨兽，掌控并奴役人类的劳动生产。\n\n我们将致力于创造一个发挥人类本真性的反利维坦世界，并将打破工具理性对人类过去数百年来的心灵束缚，我们将创造与一个“天赋人权”的一种内在自我的认同与肯定，重视人类的情感与共情的和谐社会，构建真正求同存异的多元文化大社会，凝聚人类命运共同体的共识之心。\n\n**DAOs to World的共识之心，是人类的思想，情感，文化等力量的汇聚。**\n\n### 如何加入DAOs to World并获取共识之心NFT\n\nDAOs网络是Metaverse的原生社会雏形，也是未来全球新的协同秩序，当DAOs趋近成熟时，所有人都可以加入，正如跨链的意义在于建立多链网络的互通，而DAO与DAO之间也是如此趋势，无论是底层技术或者社会规律，都预示了DAOs网络的必然出现。\n\n现阶段是DAOs网络的思想萌芽期，在此聚集认可并认同DAOs这一发展趋势的志同道合之人，早期建设者在不久的将来将获得一组NFTs，即“共识之心”协议的“思想火炬”的NFTs，DAO将在火炬手的凝聚中大量涌现，并共同探索与建立DAO与DAO之间的业务合作，基于不同国家政策的合规性探索建设，也会是我们的重点任务。\n\n###

DAO和DAICO撬开了我对DAO的第一次认知。\n\n在当年的ICO其实存在两个问题，一是项目方的背书与项目大部分都是仓促包装，二是代币募资的手段依旧是通过私人钱包转账。后面发现了市场的需求，我们用一组智能合约来控制社区投资人与项目方的资金流转，并通过多签钱包来决定项目方的锁仓释放到约定地址。基于这个基础逻辑，再进一步完善链上提案与多签投票，这就是投研DAO的早期雏形。后来由于ICO监管政策的下发，不得不放弃这个产品的开发。\n\n再一次认真思考DAO的契机，在于2020年下半年，因工作需求在探索基于链上信用体系的社交网络，如何构建成为一个大型的开放世界网络，意外接触到了Metaverse的概念。随着研究逐步发现，基于区块链技术的加密货币交易网络，才能构建Metaverse开放式的、自由的、去中心化的经济系统。而我在研究链上社交网络时，从DID、DAO、链上信用治理协议，NFT数据确权，去中心化的数据商品交易与去中心化的仲裁网络等，都让我逐步形成了一个原生数字社会的整体认知，而这一切意味着，Metaverse的原生社会系统正在孕育中，DID、NFT、DAO是建设Metaverse原生社会系统的核心。\n\n我对Web3的认知路径，实际上我是从Crypto到Metaverse，再从Metaverse回到Web3，虽然在几年前就知道Gavin wood对Web3的描述，但因缺乏对数字社会的研究，以及缺乏涉猎广泛的社科知识，还不能深刻理解Web3革命的意义所在。然而2021年对DAO的理解止步人性不可技术量化的认知，而停下了探索脚步。\n\n2022年初所在的团队确定Web3的发展方向，并继承了过去2年所探索的社交信用，设计一款Social-DAO的产品，然而我在设计Social-DAO时所面临的最大难题，就是DAO的文化难题。文化是DAO治理机制的灵魂，DAO的治理会面临大量的价值观抉择问题，正如良好的经济制度激发人性之美，糟糕的经济制度纵容人性之恶。经济制度与治理机制的抉择，完取决于价值观的抉择。\n\n文化决定了一个DAO的价值观与发展原则，文化所形成的道德秩序，是DAO治理机制的设计原则。缺失文化秩序，意味着法律失去道德的约束，意味着你做一个更好的治理工具，只会加剧治理作恶的发生。所以，正是这些经历促使走上一条与众不同的DAO研究路线。\n\n而在同期阶段，也尝试搞了一个BMW DAO作为去中心化协同的实践，号召人才很容易，但是可持续发展的出路在哪？似乎是每一个尝试建立DAO的BUIDL都会面临这类问题。但是这次尝试让我意识到，真正优秀的Web3人才都散落在各种DAO，公司仅仅是他们摸鱼的后勤阵地。随后，便离职出来深度研究DAO，试图找到一个有效的突破口。\n\n三次探索DAO的契机，止步于政策，人性，文化，对于那些艰巨的难题，俗话说事不过三，这一次大胆跳进这个兔子洞，多少个苦苦冥思的夜晚，翻阅了大量的材料，撰写了很多废稿，目录结构推翻了N遍，终于从DAOs网络，协议聚合器，产权制度，开放式Loot的可组合NFTs，以及治理制度的整合设计，总算撬动了一个突破口。\n\n可能有不少朋友看到我在DAO的探索中有一种偏执，因为对于一个困扰了几年的难题，出现三次止步的难题，假设这一次不倾注心血搞定，可能还会碰到第四次，第五次，第六次...\n\n希望这篇深度研究，能够对各位DAO BUIDL带来有效的启发，有机会一起合作，推进DAO的建设与发展。\n\n文末有关于DAOs to World 的彩蛋，记得不可错过。\n\n感谢@茶灯灯lightness.eth

技术实现背后的价值观\n\n我们通常忽略“技术哲学观”，即指导技术方案如何实现的价值观，正如POW与POS两种不同的共识机制，背后是不同理念的技术应用体现，而延续该理念的跨学科实践，即基于POW的治理经济模型不依赖于历史的计算优势，意味着以公平性随时随地可以加入到整个比特币网络当中开始计算。而在POS的治理经济模型需要抵押token参与到节点的计算权限，并且随着质押Token的数量级与时间，获得了历史的计算优势，意味着先发者将获得更大的优势。\n\n**技术实现背后的价值观决定了技术方案的未来走向。**例如Crypto与Web3的DAO，是同一种技术原理的不同范式体现。Web3的核心是产权回归的数据权益经济，而Crypto的核心是记录账本数据状态的唯一性。而正是区块链技术在Crypto与Web3的同一性，导致我们对DAO应用出现了理念到应用的混淆，这是现阶段普遍存在的。\n\n**Web3产权回归的内核**\n\n用户拥有个人数据的所有权，是Web3的核心观念，Web3的建设都需要围绕这个核心命题进行，属于Web3的真正商业模式的趋势，是以用户的数据所有权所分离出的具体权能的商业应用模式，例如数据使用权的收益激励。\n\n然而，数据所有权和所有制是有一定的区分，所有权是所有制的实现方式之一，所有制由一个国家的社会制度所决定。这一特点为我们在建设Web3的所有权商业模式时，与所在地的国家制度与政策提供了一个平衡的契机，这是未来合规性的关键所在。\n\n身份自主权是Web3产权的另一个核心，简单比喻，分离具体权利的权能是一个所有权持有者的核心权利体现，也是其个人自主意志的体现，不受中心结构约束其权能的使用。在Web3的讨论范畴中，身份自主权是个人主权思想与产权制度的融合体现。\n\n为了进一步了解什么是产权，我需要简单科普下什么是产权制度\n\n \n \n\n### 产权制度的重要性\n\n> **关于产权的基本定义**\n>\n> 关于产权的基本定义——“产权是指“一个社会所实施的选择种经济品的使用的权利”，它包括人们对一种资源的使用权、收益权与转让权。从产权的角度上来说，一切交易行为都是进行该资源的权利交易行为，而交易的达成，则是双方进行资源重组和转让条件的合约谈判。而交易费用的存在，则使得交易当事人之间会采用不同的合约安排形式。\n>\n> 支配交易的真正基础是物品或资源所有者对它所拥有的权利，价格只是对附着于这一物品的权利的衡量。\n>\n> “一个人所拥有的不是资源，而是该资源的权利”\n\n> **产权与所有权的关系**\n>\n> 产权并不是资源持有者与资源之间的关系，而是资源持有者对资源的权利关系，以及资源持有者与其他相关人，不相关人的一切权利关系。所有权作为一种财产权利，是产权所有制的一种实现方式，但不是唯一方式。\n\n> **产权的完整界定原则**\n>\n> 大陆法中对所有权的制定原则，不是对资源的具体权利的有限列举，而是尽所有可能的权利。这就是产权与所有权的“完整界定”原则。\n>\n> 而拥有所有权的人也被赋予了分离具体权利的权能，并且分离出的权利可由他人实施。例如租赁权，使用权均为所有权的具体分离权利。\n\n> **产权制度的两大权能**\n>\n> 排他性与可让渡性是产权最重要的权能。\n>\n> 排他性有两层含义：一是选择资源使用的排他性，即决定谁在特定的方式下有使用稀缺资源的权利，对公寓拥有完整产权的主体有权决定如何使用公寓，是自己住还是出租，是根据价格来出租还是根据关系来出租。二是对资源收益权的排他性，如果所有者选择将公寓出租，他就有权从财产的服务中获得所有租金收入。\n>\n> 可让渡性是以互相同意的条款交易资源的权利，所有者有权决定按任意价格通过交互将资源出租，出售，甚者授权给他人使用。转让权是市场合约的一个先决条件，资产权的使用权与收益权不一定包含资产的转让权，但资产的转让权一定包含资产的使用权与收益权。\n\n> **产权激励经济的功能**\n>\n> 产权作为一种制度对于促进经济的效果非常明显，通常具有预期和激励两种功能：\n>\n> “产权安排如果造成经济主体预期不稳，它所产生的激励就是负向的；产权安排如何是生产性的，就会降人们的行为引向有利于社会财富增长的努力；产权安排如果是分配性的，就会将人们的行为引向非生产性努力”\n\n以上内容引用自《现代社会秩序的制度基础》\n\n这就是当前Web3以及DAO普遍存在的问题，唯有发生产权激励的生产性行为，才能促进Web3领域的正外部性发展，而目前很多Crypto项目的DAO，正是其代币经济模型作为分配性的结果，导致社群往非生产性方向努力。产权制度的缺失是目前大多Web3项目与DAO所出现的问题，并且是根源性的问题。\n\n## DAO治理机制的规则悖论\n\n### 针对DAO的四层批判\n\n针对DAO的深度批判，详细可见我在[加密精英的傲慢：对DAO的深层批判 / 论DAO的七宗罪 / DAOs微观权力结构](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2NzEyMjY1OA==&mid=2247484321&idx=1&sn=4ec8f7a705c6d3bcca4ab9bd47a05e93&chksm=ce412f2cf936a63a11605971379ae5657fa50e404a5ded9efdb7f5d58ce4efb2f279e2a16575&scene=21#wechat_redirect)一文的描述，在此处仅简单描述：\n\n**表征性：权益治理的不平等**\n\n以经济权重为治理依据的POS共识，确保过程分配的公平性，但无法保障外部优势利用规则形成的不平等结果，例如社区的利益相关者可以为了投票选中对自己有利的提案，可以从外部借用大量资金进行抵押，获得利益结果后再撤销。在Defi的大量DAO的治理项目中，POS的股权制思想的体现了股东话语权的经济结果，无法承载Web3产权核心制的治理需求。Defi项目之所以普遍存在这个情况，在于大多数项目都在割韭菜。\n\n**根源性：共识算法的局限性**\n\n“为了解决POW算法的缺点，业内开始提出POS共识机制，POS不仅仅是为了解决POW资源浪费的问题，更试图提出一种新的共识价值观范式，即账本参与者需要质押自身的利益，能够更好地避免节点作恶的概率。这其实是一种价值观的技术设计理念，并不代表客观的事实，事实证明DAO对权益证明的应用，充满了节点联合作恶的现象。”\n\n**社会性：自由民主的幻觉**\n\n自由民主作为一种社会理念的宣传口号，而一旦落实到社会制度的实践上面，维护一套社会制度不仅需要与深层次的文化观念融合，同时维持社会制度需要庞大的经济支撑。当试图通过DAO来实现所谓的“自由民主”的社会愿景时，反而成了滋养各种自由民主迷思的温床，成为了各种不切实际幻想的精神载体。我们可以看到大量的DAO自以为投票选举就是自由民主的体现，却不具备对制度性的深层思考，把服务民主的操作手段误认为这就是民主制度的体现。 \n \n\n**历史性：加密精神的沦丧**\n\n阿桑奇曾在《密码朋克》一书对全世界的告诫：**“为了免受一切权力以任何暴力形式而让渡个人的权利。”**\n\n加密精神的意义在于让个人主权意识的觉醒，而比特币的诞生背景，在于保护个人私有财富不受传统金融系统的沾染。而在Web3时代所继承的加密精神，是个人产权意识的觉醒，即个人拥有自身数据的所有权，并有权决定该数据的金融变现方式。“数据价值的自定义”应该是建设Web3需要值得思考的关键问题。\n\nCrypto与Web3当前依旧处于文明发展史的原始期，如果缺乏对正统精神的继承，不保护个人的财富，也不保护个人的产权，这样的Web3的项目，这样的DAO项目，要么是在割韭菜，要么是在自欺欺人。\n\n### 路径依赖的经验惯性\n\n实际上，今天我们建设DAO的认知，依旧深受早期The DAO，ICO，与DAICO思想的影响，尤其是Defi的赛道的爆发，Staking质押治理的普遍影响力，导致我们在Web3的范畴中，**对于DAO治理的思想惯性，经常受到Crypto原生路径的干涉。**\n\n不管当前DAO的各种治理手段看起来是多么的体现出一种集体自治理的民主制，围绕共识所建立的治理机制的内核才是关键。例如当前的DAO所遵循的范式，是以DAICO为内核的DAO，其内核是一种去中心化的项目投资与资金管理方式，通过多个智能合约的连环控制，实现从募资，质押，到清算的链上交易行为。\n\nDefi使得AMM协议与Staking经济成为Defi的主要建设方式，而忽略了DAICO作为一种更具有价值的链上投资交易的协同作用。但不管如何，DAICO所主导的Crypto -DAO的范式思想依旧影响着当前Web3-DAO的建设。\n\n建设Web3的DAO必定要摆脱DAICO路径依赖的经验惯性，我们需要重新回归对POS与POW共识争议的问题根源，从新理解共识机制是如何影响集体决策。POW与POS的博弈，是破解DAO治理难题的关键所在。\n\n### 伪民主的DAO治理机制\n\n治理代币的存在，一方面扩大并维护了共识的价值，另一方面也让治理权力成为一种可被交易的流动性权力关系。这就意味着**民主的集体决策成为一种可被货币操纵的治理机制。**\n\n如果从公司制的股权权重来看，治理代币的存在似乎合情合理，持有更大比例的股东拥有更多的决策权。而从社会治理的角度来看，治理代币意味着治理的决策者职位可以通过交易购买，这种权力腐败的行为，是个正常社会都会杜绝的事情。\n\nDAO作为一种新的自治组织理念，共同治理不仅仅是投票这个动作，而是从组织结构与治理制度上实现真正的共同治理。明目张胆忽略经济的外部优势，介入到DAO的所谓公平投票手段，实际上只是自由资本的优势方，对其他DAO成员的资本收割。\n\n用一堆看似符合民主自治的治理手段与经济激励，掩饰其自身制度框架的缺陷，这是当前DAO普遍存在问题，**共同治理缺乏制度保障**，这样的DAO一旦脱离经济刺激就基本很难持续发展。\n\n## 制度缺陷导致DAO的发展困境\n\n### 币权替换了产权\n\nWeb3的意义在于产权回归运动，DAO的参与者所享有的是围绕共同产权所享有的一切收益回报，产权关系决定了治理的权能。而**治理代币替代了产权关系所赋予的真正的治理权能，进而剥夺了DAO的参与者真正的治理权利。**\n\n**币权替换了产权，是当前DAO治理制度的根本矛盾**，数据所有权与身份自主权都在这个制度框架中，被治理代币的比例权重替代，这是个体主权被金融异化的方式，也是为何目前大量DAO的参与建设者，感受不到自己作为具有自主性意志的个体，所应得的个人主权价值。\n\n一切缺乏产权制度的DAO，一切可交易流通的治理代币决定治理权重的DAO，都是加密自由资本所操纵的虚伪民主的DAO，任何外部生产业务的引进，其核心是继续形成对参与者的劳动剩余价值的剥削。“白嫖”是对这一根本症结的讽刺。\n\n### 不平等制度的虚假公平\n\n当一种组织制度从根本上是不平等的制度时，无论其表现形式采用看起来多么民主的手段，注定是一种违背民主精神的不平等制度。**治理代币作为一种流动性权力的体现，使得去中心化自治成为形同虚设。**\n\n投票仅作为一种公平手段，仅仅是治理决策机制最后的那个“投篮动作”，但这种表现形式最容易成为“戏剧表演”的宣传，也是最容易激起民粹主义意识形态的象征动作。最后导致集体狂热追求一切“民主手段”，而无视社会发展的基本常识。\n\n不可避免，这是未来DAO的浪潮真正兴起之时，DAO的狂热支持者会普遍出现的情况，以此试图形成彻底颠覆旧秩序的威慑力。\n\n不平等治理制度的缺陷，还体现在集体决策的“集体迷思”现象。**“追求全体一致的压力非常强大时，这种压力就会使这个决策团体出现消极逃避行为模式，进而导致决策团体偏向于选择那些最不会遭到反对的方案”，**类似发生集体迷思的DAO治理案例，在过去一年当中发生的并不少见，例如社区舆论裹挟投票让核心创始人下台。\n\n一个追求平等的民主制度，背后需要一个追求正义的道德秩序，否则民主沦为民粹仅一步之遥。如果忽略了制度性的思考，也就无法触及到这一层面的问题对治理公平性的影响。\n\n## 第二部分：审视\n\n## 社会结构的进化\n\n### 什么是社会进步\n\n当“社会”这一词汇被创造出来之时，其本身就具有进步主义的思想隐喻，正如任何一个社会的发展预期，永远只能是为了更好地生存发展而建设，一个美好的社会应该是怎样的？以及我们又应该朝着哪个方向而努力。所以，当我们在思考任何社会问题的时候，无论是对丑陋的批判，又或者是对美好的歌颂，都是源自于我们对社会进步的渴望。\n\n**社会进步主要体现在对社会的两种改善，一种是纠正异常，一种是提升常态。**\n\n纠正异常的前提条件是理解当前社会什么是常态，如果一个人不清楚什么是一个社会应该的常态就试图纠正社会上的异常情况，就像一个医生在不知道一个人的正常健康状态下，就给“病人”动手术治病。\n\n提升常态是指将社会从常规水平提升到一个更高的水准，提升常态是一种底线发展原则，意义在于从社会制度/结构上实现系统化的升级，例如消除绝对贫困这样的社会任务，就是一种提升底线发展原则的社会进步。\n\n### 社会协同的博弈\n\n猎鹿博弈与猎兔博弈是指猎人在打猎时，根据其共同的狩猎目标而形成的博弈关系。猎鹿博弈与猎兔博弈是一组互相转化的博弈关系。\n\n通常情况下，单个猎人可以捕捉兔子，而猎鹿则需要一群猎人齐心协力共同完成，而一旦其中有任一个猎人在途中狩猎兔子，都将会导致猎鹿的失败。\n\n猎鹿的动机在于通过集体合作获得更大的收益，而猎兔则是为了个人的利益而狩猎。猎鹿博弈的启示在于，集体所形成的社会合作所涉及到的博弈关系。\n\n \n \n\n在猎鹿博弈中，只有所有的猎人心中都寻求猎鹿的共同目的，整体才会形成猎鹿博弈，而一旦其中有任何一人转向猎兔目的，则狩猎集体又将迅速转化为猎兔博弈。\n\n猎鹿博弈本质上是组织结构与生存策略的协同进化，一方面在猎鹿过程中，避免任何合作方出现背叛一定是出自于其文化观念的道德约束，因为在猎鹿过程中一旦出现猎兔的机会，缺乏道德自觉的猎人一定会选择猎兔行为。**猎人在行动上的道德自觉性，是猎鹿博弈的关键。**\n\n### 社会结构中的能动性\n\n能动性是社会结构的构成因素之一，社会中的个体有能力在自己所处的社会关系中施加某种程度的控制，反过来也意味着有能力使得这些社会关系发生改变。所以，在某种程度上来说，**能动者被社会结构赋权，得以协同或者对抗他人的活动。**\n\n能动性是个体在社会结构当中，与生俱来的特点，而能动性的体现方式又是种类极为繁多，并且是由其文化和历史所决定的。社会结构对不同的能动者进行了不同的赋权，使其表现出不同的欲求、意图以及相关知识，结构以及所赋予的人类能动性充斥着各种不同的权力。\n\n能动性是集体的也是个体的，个人运用能动性的范围很大程度上是由于他们在集体性组织内的位置所决定的，个人运用的能动性在的各种资源和方式主要来自于集体，也正是因为个人能动性的差异造就了集体的权力差异。而能动者的共识也是改变集体关系的共识。\n\n在某种程度上，能动者是基于自己的动机与目的，建立协同关系或者破坏关系，而在遵循道德伦理的法理学理论当中，对于能动性概念倾向于这么一个等式，**“能动性”=“道德责任”=“道德正当性的情境”，**能动者的道德自觉性，作为其内在的动机或者意图，才能确保其行动的在社会秩序当中的合理性。\n\n \n \n\n## 探讨产权制度的原则\n\n### 产权的根本：完整性与自主性\n\n完整性与自主性是我们在探讨Web3产权制度的两个根本所在。首先关于完整性，完整性是指尽可能所有的完整所有权，**完整所有权不是对具体权利的有限列举，而是尽所有可能的权利。**完整所有权是所有者对一个资源所具有的最大可能的利益，不管是已知的，还是未知的。\n\n对于产权的完整性界定，在另一个角度，是以对该资源权利的排他性来衡量。排他性包括对资源使用的排他性，以及所拥有权利的转让性。例如，所有者可以阻止其他人使用或者出借，保留其所拥有而权力，避免任何人从该资源中获益。\n\n正如我自身将来在Web3的应用生态中，所拥有的一切数据资源，我有权将其烂在我的本地硬盘，拒绝任何人以及任何组织的使用。\n\n \n 随着商业环境的演化，产权的功能逐渐复杂与多样化，而基于完整所有权的持有者，所具有的具体权利的分离权能，就显得非常重要。正是因为资产的所有权，我们的资产才得以通过具体分离的权利，例如租赁权，抵押权等方式，在商业环境中持续获得价值。\n\n**具体权利的分离权能是产权主体所具有的，最重要的自主权力，**只要交易约定能够达成共识，主权个体有资格分离出任何具体的产权权利，分离具体权利的权能，是主权思想在产权的重要体现。\n\n个人数据资源的所有权，以及具体权利的分离权能，都是我们在Web3的相关产品，以及DAO的相关产权制度中，极其重要的权益基础。而在当前阶段，*我们所看到的各种Xfi的产品，我们几乎没有看到这方面的制度设计，这些都是虚假的Web3的产品，必须大胆承认这一客观事实。*\n\n### 制度的天平：共赢与共治\n\n共赢重要还是共治重要？当我们在讨论共同治理的时候，我们不能忽略追求共同治理是为了集体共赢。**共赢是目标，共同治理则是我们为了实现这一目标的手段。**\n\n公共治理的民主决策，有时候被狭隘的自我完善主义者扭曲为理解为“个人权利重于集体权利”，然而公共治理的条件成立的基础，在于集体所处的公共空间，即个人所生存发展的环境，治理的意义在于对公共空间的资本分配，以及权力关系的约束。事实上，一个好的社会制度，集体共赢往往优先于集体共治，**集体共赢才有足够的社会盈余来确保社会常态的基本底线，共赢才能保障社会发展的可持续性。**\n\n我们对于共治的执着，体现在在于对“自由与平等”的强烈渴望，甚者不少人对DAO的民主投票制度的捍卫，时常引用古希腊雅典的城邦民主制，*当然，从文化历史的根源上来说，DAO的自治所体现的政治共同体，确实源自于雅典民主制，当面临个体利益与集体利益的抉择时，这也是肤浅的民主捍卫者们所掌握的历史武器，但是时候戳破这个不切实际的幻想了。*\n\n> “一个强调集体决策的天赋智慧和约束性质、强调公民自由和所有公民的平等的信仰系统，形成了雅典民主的 ‘宪法’（一个用来描述雅典政体那些得到正式承认的原则与实践的词汇，虽然不准确，但是很方便）的基础。自由和平等都是有限的、有条件：个人自由受制于个人必须服从集体利益，平等则只限于政治领域。雅典人从来没有发展出个人的不可剥夺的‘消极权利’（私人事务不受政府干涉的自由）原则，或者相对于国家的少数人权利原则，这就是当代自由主义的核心原则。”\n>\n> 《民主雅典的精英与大众》\n\n### 社会制度确保社会正义的必要性\n\n对于正义的理解，决定了我们理解什么是良好的社会制度，什么是糟糕的社会制度，一个社会对正义的坚持与追求，决定了社会人民的整体权利的正当性，以及对于人民尊严的基本尊重。\n\n例如一个充满剥削的社会，一个资本异化的社会，将人民异化为资本的劳动力，将人格扭曲为社会生产的机器，这是对人类基本的尊严的践踏，这是一个违背人类道德的非正义行为；\n\n构建一个人人平等的社会，是我们追求正义的目标结果之一，假如一个社会制度缺乏对人权平等的捍卫，那么权力的差异比较导致强势群体对弱势群体的人格尊严践踏。\n\n捍卫正义的社会平等制度，才能个体所有权的一切权利的使用，提供了合理的正当性。**设想一个不伸张正义的社会制度，暴力掠夺将成为常态，**个人产权将完全没有保障，所谓的个人主权也将成为幻灭的美梦。\n\n \n \n\n## DAO治理的道德秩序\n\n### Code is Law要接受道德观念的约束\n\n**法律绝非精英的治理游戏，必须接受道德观念的约束。**道德与法律两者之间的互相促进的作用，构成了现代法治社会的治理方式。道德与法律背后体现的是社会秩序的二元结构，即法律明文的规定与管理，社会道德氛围的文化规训。\n\nCode is law似乎有点成为了技术掌权者肆意使用的某种技术权力，缺乏道德的约束，技术作恶的现象将一发不可收拾，尤其是加密金融领域，充斥着金钱诱惑的世界。\n\nDAO的链上治理机制，不仅仅是基于代码实现，也要在代码实现的规则当中，体现道德观念的约束，**Code is Morality and law才是正确的技术观念**，技术作为一种工具手段必须平衡好道德与法律。\n\n代码是构建数字世界的字符工具，同时也是语义规则的体现，而语义规则与道德系统在社会结构当中具有同一性，因为对于Code is law若是缺乏道德秩序的约束，那么数字资本主义将通过技术手段不可避免地进行数字社会的全方面异化，主权思想的文化精神也将由此泯灭而失败的，Web3革命也将由此失败。\n\n### 灵魂不可出售，道德不能定价\n\n赎罪券是中世纪时期，基督教的道德观堕落，哪怕是教职人员堕落犯罪，都可以通过购买圣徒遗物与赎罪券，来对上帝表达忏悔并由此得到灵魂的救赎。而这一切起源，在于**教会开始强调外在效果的形式化道德标准，进而不可避免地导致道德普遍的虚伪化，最终堕落为被金钱异化的地步。**\n\n宗教改革运动的一大成就，就是将宗教的道德信仰，从追求形式化的道德标准进行瓦解，信徒可以通过内心直接与上帝对话，忏悔，无须要经过教堂这一中间机构，作为上帝的代理人。\n\n灵魂是人权的本真性，如果人权被贩卖销售，那么和奴隶制没什么区别，如果道德可以被交易，那么就是现代版的数字赎罪券运动。\n\n我之所以如此担忧，在于治理代币的道德意义上，就已经在发生一场现代版的赎罪券运动了。具有社会治理权力的能力个体，即具有影响社会关系的能动者，一定要求其具有内在道德的自觉性，而治理代币则让治理的道德成为可被交易的商品，抹除了个体建立内在道德自觉性的社会基础。\n\n### 自我赋权是一种道德自治\n\n对人权尊严的基本尊重，体现在包容每个人的自我肯定与内心的自由追求，**个人主权思想是一种内心自我解放的思想，因为内心不自由的个体无法获得我们所寻求的意义上的自由。**\n\n唯有充分实现自我肯定的个体，才能实现内心意义上的自由解放，唯有这个时，才是每一个独立个体的觉醒时刻。\n\n**自我赋权源自于个体对自我权利的赋能**，即每一个因为内心的诉求而发挥自己的能动性，这背后既源自于政治共同体所赋予的治理权力，也源自于道德观念赋予每个人的主权权利。\n\n自我赋权作为一种德道自治的行为，而不是任由个人欲望放纵的行为，一切符合道德自治的行为，都是建立在政治共同体中，一种互相承认的共识原则。\n\n### 求同存异：包容文化的复合性\n\n文化复合性是指，在不同的社会共同体当中，内部结构与外在实体呈现一种杂糅的状态，例如在神话典故中，“龙”作为一种图腾符号，就是不同部落文化杂糅而成为一种新的文化象征。\n\n**文化复合性是自我与他者关系的结构化形式，没有哪一种文化是完全孤立的单体，**文化总是处于与其他文化不断地接触与互动交流的过程中。\n\n所以说，文化一种可以被习得的共识，通过所处环境的互动交流，逐步形成一种价值观念，主导并约束在文化所处的环境当中的所作所为。\n\n文化作为象征意义的系统，既是抽象的，也是可以变迁的，对于多元文化的复合结构的理解，必须以一种动态的流动性视野来看待。而这一过程又是通过持续不断的文化接触与互动交流得以体现，这是一个社会的文化之所以能够得到持续发展的原因所在。\n\n在某种程度上来说，文化的复合性与包容性越强，则文化的活跃度越高，**文化活跃是一个社会经济繁荣与政治稳定的象征。**\n\n## 第三部分：蜕变\n\n## 治理权力的约束与赋能\n\n### 制度矛盾与权力冲突\n\n简单来说，社会实践是由一系列行动构成的，而这些行动主要体现为各种互动的形式，包括涉及到意义的沟通这一互动形式，这种构成性结构是“社会共同体”的特征。\n\n互动的生成有三个基本要素：作为“有意义的”互动构成；作为道德秩序的互动构成；作为权力关系的互动构成。\n\n**互动的意义是积极而持续地协商的结果**，例如在日常生活中，互动的参与者们通过制造、理解和使用语言，从而形式对句子的互相理解。而这一过程是以一种共有知识作为阐释框架，以确保在互动过程中，创造和维持着沟通的情境。\n\n互动的“意义”形式，正是我们通过交流形成共识的关键所在。\n\n互动的道德因素与互动的“意义”因素和权力关系因素是有机地联系在一起的 ，道德秩序的互动构成是权利的实现与义务的履行，而正是意义的互动结构形成我们在互动中的道德秩序。\n\n在互动的形式当中，道德秩序的互动矛盾是引起权力关系矛盾的关键所在，通俗来说，**正是因为观念的矛盾形成权力制度上的矛盾。**\n\n### 权力关系的约束与赋能\n\n在社会结构的互动形式中，每一个互动都是道德关系和权力关系的互动。道德秩序下所要求的权利和义务，同互动的权力关系一起，同时具有约束与赋能的作用，例如一个人在社会实践当中，其所践行的义务没有得到认可或尊重，或者没有得到有效的约束，那么基于道德与权力的互动关系当中的权利与义务的平衡就会被打破。\n\n对于治理权力的约束与赋能，绝非通过经济手段的奖惩机制，否则这将会导致经济与权力形成新的互相制约与赋能关系，进而导致权力腐败的出现。治理权力的约束与赋能必须置身于一个更加完整全面的社会结构当中。\n\n## 去中心化治理协议实现DAO的治理\n\n### 协议作为治理规则的体现\n\n当我们试图构建一个平等社会的时候，实际上是在建立一个公平游戏的规则，**一个公平游戏的规则是公开透明且对所有参与者都是一致性的。**而这个似乎正是POW共识更加体现出来的优势。\n\n社会系统的各种治理手段，秩序、制度以及机制等都是规则的不同体现，而良好的规则一定是符合社会道德的规范与要求，规则作为一种社会治理的共识而被共同遵循。\n\n对于执行规则的条件约定，是社会契约的体现，而协议作为基于契约关系的双边约定，其具体的书面形态常以法律合同的方式体现。\n\n所以，在一场所有人遵循共识的公平游戏规则当中，**建立协议是参与者达成共识的关键约定条件。**\n\n### 协议作为治理权力的体现\n\n协议作为执行规则的约定条件，协议所体现的共识是对双边关系的约束与赋能。在双方在互动结构中，所各自具备的权利以及义务。这就是协议作为治理权力对双边关系的重要性体现。\n\n在福柯的权力谱系理论中，**权力关系存在于任何存在差异的个体之间，**这是从双边关系的差异中对权力的提炼与定义，实际上意味着这种微观的权力关系无处不在，并且渗透在社会系统的方方面面。\n\n协议作为一种天然的关系型权力，因为人员的流动性因此也具备了权力的流动性特征。而这在社会的互动结构中，意味着个体的能动性将牵引着协议关联着自身所能影响到的一切权力关系当中，进而通过协议载体来实现权力关系对人脉关系的改造，现实当中的一个典型例子，就是商业活动对人脉资源的利用并建立合作契约。\n\n### 协议作为文化秩序的体现\n\n通过上文，有意义的互动中可以看到，意义的结构通常也是基于共同知识的语义规则系统。而正是**语义规则系统的二重性，形成了社会结构的二重性，即结构既是人类行动的结果，也是引导人类行为的媒介。**\n\n**社会互动中的结构二重性**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K9XpyPlE1RKZ285_TmSuM.png?height=324&width=762)\n\n总而言之，沟通、权力和道德是互动的有机因素，而意义、支配和合法化是结构的特征；这些特征只有在分析意义上才能区分开来。因此，进一步补充，支配结构可以视为资源系统，合法化结构可以视为道德规则系统，这些形态都是有机的整体，而不是互相独立的组成部分。\n\n而与集体的整体性来看，语义规则和道德规则，通过规范的诠释框架存在一个共同的文化，而权力则通过支配结构中的工具，形成对意义结构与合法化结构的互动关系。\n\n因此，在这个结构的二重性当中，协议作为权力的工具，形成对互动结构中的支配作用。\n\n\\*这段源自阐释社会学理论，比较复杂，后续会单独研究输出一篇文章。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n## 基于去中心化治理协议的治理结构\n\n### 探讨去中心化治理的视野局限\n\nDAO的治理并非是技术实现的难题，而是基于政治、哲学、经济、社会与文化等构成的技术实现的治理难题，**这是一个高度复杂且多学科杂糅的系统性难题。**\n\n实际上，当前的我们更多是通过技术手段的方式，改造具体生产关系当中的某个具体业务动作，暂时还不涉及到去中心化治理会写形成什么样的组织结构以及社会制度。\n\n所以，在现阶段当中，我们必须承认当前阶段的视野局限性，我们所能够做的，就是站在尽可能的视野去看见这个全新的组织形态将会如何。而我基于我当前的一切认知，也是具有局限性，但同时也仅仅是阶段性的，我会保持高频率的认知与思考的更新，并联合更多的力量进行实践。 \n \n\n### 基于去中心化治理协议的基础模型\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uc6cOP_JUFDemTZa6aH9I.png?height=587&width=1080)\n\n实际上，当我们在讨论去中心化治理的时候，需要进一步分析，治理作为权力方式的构成，自治是一种民主权力的体现，然而，权力的构成分为决策的权力与执行的权力。其次，权力的使用主体与权力的作用对象，又是一个什么样的关系？至少要梳理明白治理背后的权力构成与权力关系，才能正确找到合适的“去中心化的治理方式”，也就是**“去中心化的权力结构”**\n\n所以，基于去中心化的权力结构关系当中，DAO本身作为一个权力的决策与权力的执行主体，进而实现对DAO的组织成员的权力支配，目前的主流观念中，将这一过程视为“去中心化的治理”，然而，我想说的是，这是一种狭义的去中心化治理的认知呈现。\n\n我们需要进一步剖析“去中心化”这一概念，事实上，并不存在的绝对的中心化与去中心化，从词语本身的概念理解，“去中心化”与“中心化”是一种比较语境，是某物相对于另一物的状态或形态的区分。所以，**当我们讨论权力的主体关系时，永远存在“中心化”与“去中心化”的关系呈现。**\n\n由此，但我们在讨论DAO的权力关系的去中心化与中心化关系时，就需要拎得清不同权力主体之间的关系。例如，少数人集体发起的权力决策，通过所有权的决策投票，进行将权力执行到所有成员，然而，权力诞生于DAO这个主体又同时作用于自身，这显然并不是一种真正的权力去中心化。**权力的决策与权力的执行应该由进行充分的隔离，这样的权力结构才符合去中心化的权力结构方式。**\n\n因此，在本基础结构模型当中，DAO的治理权力的制定与监督并非来自DAO本身，而是来自外部力量。\n\n \n \n\n### 基于去中心化治理协议的设计原则\n\n1，DAO治理的权重根据治理Token持有量进行权重衡量；\n\n2，DAO成员无法通过任何交易手段获得治理Token；\n\n3，DAO成员只能通过DAO组织的活动获得治理Token，但该治理Token不具备交易或转让等功能；\n\n4，DAO成员可以根据自己的治理Token获得外部性的权益奖励；\n\n5，获得治理代币的账号不可交易...\n\n...\n\n以上为根据基础模型的一些基本设计原则的概括，针对具体的应用案例描述，我将会在后续的案例篇中进行描述，还请期待。关于具体案例的讨论主要将在DAOs to World社群中讨论，加入方式在全文末尾。\n\n### 关于治理Token的约束与赋能\n\n治理Token的不可转让性，以及不能之间参与到任何代币交易的过程中，是为了避免治理权力与经济优势建立直接关系。治理的优先权重，不是比谁多，而是谁更具备治理的资历与能力。 \n \n\n治理Token的赋能应该以刺激持有者的能动性参与对治理关系的改造过程当中，这里需要严谨区分，赋能不可得同于激励，但激励可以是赋能当中的一部分。\n\n对治理权力的约束要避免其他利益因素，造成权力的扭曲以及腐败，而对治理权力的赋能，是为了引导权力往符合治理诉求的正确方向前进，并构成正反馈的行动效应。\n\n \n \n\n## 基于去中心化治理协议的业务逻辑\n\n### DAO组织使用治理协议的流程方式\n\nDAO组织需要通过公共资产库进行影响力协议的购买进而获得使用权，当然也有可能是免费获得授权；2，其次，治理协议根据需求目的不同，使用的基础条件可能也不相同，而这此图的案例当中，治理协议是适用于特定类型的业务；\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6QtTjUqvhN78tBRC_TlEc.png?height=591&width=1080)\n\n基于协议聚合器的作用，治理协议与业务模块成为一种模块化可组合的基础设施，相关内容将在下文中重点提到。\n\n### 治理协议如何分发治理Token\n\n1，治理协议通过获得用户的交互数据，并通过协议算法进行相关Token的计量并进行分发。而治理协议分发治理token的日志数据，该数据的所有权也应当归还于用户个人。\n\n2，数据的生产日记，在某种程度上，也是DAO最重要的数据资源。在这一维度上，**DAOer就是数据的生产节点，而DAO是数据的生产工厂，但是该工厂的数据资源的产权却是归所有人共有。** \n \n\n### 基去中心化治理协议与数据所有权关系\n\n治理协议所涉及到的用户的原生数据都有哪些，以及决定数据将被如何使用，这些使用权利与适用边界，都是治理协议需要考虑的。而如图示例的简单比喻中，交互动作所产生的原生数据的存留，以及对原生数据的筛选使用，包括对协议使用数据后的日志数据，也应该完全交还用户数据的产权。 \n \n\n### 基于去中心化治理协议：DAO与DAOer的关系\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7cwWjMLgBuBmhTq5ojjzm.png?height=730&width=1080)\n\n去中心化治理协议作为DAO的外部约束手段，可同时作用于其他的DAO，治理机制是复杂而专业的能力，并不是每个DAO创办者和使用者都擅长，但是具有资源条件的DAO发起人可以通过借助外部的治理协议用于DAO的治理，而治理协议又可以同时作用于其他的DAO。\n\n每一个DAOer不可能只加入一个DAO，应该同时加入多个DAO，而DAO与DAO之间因为协议的相同数量，进一步提高了DAOer在不同的DAO之间的治理效率。事实上，目前每加入一个DAO就获得一个DAO的特定的治理权力，且该治理权只能使用于一个DAO，这也是 一种中心化的特性。然而协议的共同使得在与一个DAO的治理权能可以同样适用于另外一个DAO，不仅提高了人员的流动性，也极大地降低的治理的成本，以及避免了每一个人参与某个DAO的治理权益的损失。\n\n### 基于治理协议DAO所形成的共识关系\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LdBP7I6nBR9zWmv52TRFN.png?height=365&width=1080)\n\n随着相同去中心化治理协议的应用，DAO与DAO之间采用相同的治理协议将越来越多，由此将进步形成DAO与DAO之间的共识协议，而治理协议连接了多个DAO逐步形成了DAO之间的共识强弱，**基于DAO于DAO所连成的网络进一步形成了共识网络的圈层，DAO之间的网络效应逐步形成。** \n \n\n## 基于去中心化治理协议的案例简述\n\n### 案例的基础角色定义\n\nDAOs to World组织：一个由众多Web3er与大量的DAO构成DAOs网络\n\n无为DAO：DAOs网络中一个提供开源治理协议的DAO\n\nWeb3er Twitter互助联盟：一个通过社交媒体创造内容并建立影响力的DAO\n\n### 去中心化治理协议的应用场景\n\nWeb3er Twitter互助联盟的DAO奉行这么与一个理念：\n\n“Web3er通过内容输出建立社交媒体网络的影响力，可以帮助内容创造者通过影响力指标，形成个人的社会资本（人脉网络的信息差/资源合作机会/受众的信任度等等），能够给自己带来更好的发展机遇和成长资源，因此影响力指标是一个比推特粉丝数据，以及抽象的知名度更加有效的指标。一个具有更高影响力的Web3er可以获得更多的权利。”\n\n那么，基于社会资本理论依据，推特上的影响力构成因素，例如这里我们可以参考推特的推文分析的关键因素\n\n*1，点赞，转发，评论*\n\n*2，展示量，参与，详情展开，*\n\n*3，新关注者，个人资料访问*\n\n这三个维度的数据指标均可以作为影响力的关键数据指标\n\n社交媒体本身是一个社交网络，剔除掉一个账号的虚假粉丝数后，一个10万真实粉丝的推特博主，和一个1千真实粉丝的推特博主，对推文的影响力权重因子将会更大。其次，再进一步设定周期的互动频率与互动指标，作为推特博主在推特的社交网络圈层。也就是通过Web3er Twitter 互助联盟的成员之间互相转发，评论，互相提升了双方的有效影响力。 \n \n\n通过影响力协议的我们就可以得出一个推特博主的影响力系数，无论是单条推文或者是个人账号。当然，随着对数据分析的理解以及影响力需求分析的理解，影响力治理协议也将得到进一步的发展，或者因为价值理念的不同，这些数据的不同组合使用，被定义为声誉协议，贡献协议等等；\n\n当无为DAO根据DAOs to World组织的普遍需求，开源了影响力治理协议，声誉治理协议，贡献治理协议等等，这些治理协议就可以被不同的DAOs组织采用。因此在这个案例中，Web3er Twitter 互助联盟的影响力治理协议，就不会是联盟自己制定并自己执行。而是通过成员公开投票，选择一个公认的影响力治理协议，而这个影响力就是无为DAO开源提供的，专门作用于基于社交媒体影响力的治理协议。 \n \n\n### 去中心化治理协议的经济优势\n\n影响力协议规则，可以通过具体的数据指标而定义，那就意味着我们可以从推特上的活动更加真实地获得一个Web3er的真实影响力，进而为其发布治理Token，并通过治理协议的规则约定，对基于内容影响力的生产力起到了\n\n例如：\n\n*1，影响力治理协议规定，发布推文或者影响力系数10分的，奖励10个影响力治理Token，*\n\n*2，影响力治理Token是通过生产性活动产生的，无法通过其他渠道购买治理Token，且不可转让；*\n\n*3，具有治理Token的Web3er，可以消耗治理Token兑换推特互助DAO合作项目的白名单，或者其他*\n\n治理Token的无法转让限制，也让具有真实影响力的Web3er能够做出符合影响力价值理念的投票决策；\n\n### 去中心化治理协议的网络优势\n\n如果两个不同的DAO也采用了同样的影响力治理协议，那就意味着两个DAO之间在影响力的业务合作得以遵循同一个共识，可以通过智能合约完成业务合作。其次，因为采用了同一套治理协议，那么就意味着当Web3 Twitter 互助联盟的成员可以带着自己的影响力治理token以及影响力权益，进入到另一个采用同一共识的DAO参与建设。 \n \n\n而当DAOs to World组织的其他DAO也采用了同一套影响力治理协议时，那就意味着Web3er的治理Token与影响力权益有了更大的使用场景，可以更加自由地进入各种各样的DAO参与贡献而不会被白嫖。当越来越多的DAO出现在DAOs to World，越来越多的去中心化治理协议被创造，那么治理框架的通用议事规则也会诞生，其目的用于平衡DAO和个人与群体的权利。 \n \n\n例如：\n\n*意见占多数者，即多数方的权利；*\n\n*意见占少数者，即少数方的权利，特别是对于占总人数少于1/2但大于1/3的所谓“强少数方”的权利；*\n\n*每个成员的权利*\n\n*“缺席者”的权利*\n\n*所有上述人群作为一个整体的权利；*\n\n在提案与投票的治理流程上，我们也会形成一套合理通用的去中心化的治理框架。\n\n例如：\n\n*1，根据奥威尔1984制度协议规定，为了尊重个人主权的意志，以及对抗极端集权的垄断式统治危机，任何人都将可以发起DAO的分叉提案；*\n\n*2，根据罗伯特议事协议规定，分叉方案的利益相关人，超过1/3的赞同即可实现DAO的分叉，并启动分叉相关的协议流程；*\n\n*3，...*\n\n### DAO的发展需要去中心化治理机制\n\n**DAO的治理机制应该通过治理协议实现开放式的，去中心化，自由化的基本原则。**只有基于DAOs网络的去中心化治理协议与去中心化治理框架的存在，DAO才能得以真正实现。DAO的治理机制应该是去中心化的治理机制，而去中心化的治理机制主要由去中心化的治理协议与去中心化的治理框架构成。随着治理需求的发展，去中心化的治理机制也将逐渐迭代。\n\n现阶段当一个DAO成员离开一个DAO，不仅不能够带走自身的劳动产权证明，还无法将自己所积累的治理贡献带走。这种做法非常不合理，不符合Web3产权回归价值观。\n\n关于更加具体详细案例讲解与分析：包括治理协议与DAO之间的文化系统，经济模型，以及治理协议的具体设计；相关内容将重点在DAOs toWorld的社群优先分享。(加入方式请看本文结尾\n\n## 第四部分：新生\n\n## DAOs网络的结构特征与资本主义演化\n\n### 资本文明的地理与文化环境\n\n> “欧洲这种竞争性的文化性格的形成，与欧洲地理环境的多样性，以及地势之支离破碎直接有关。更具体地说，欧洲存在着山地，丘陵，平原和曲折多变的海岸区域，生活于这些不同地理环境的人，发展出不同的生活方式，包括不同的经济生活、语言、宗教，形成多元的民族。地理环境的差异性，形成生活方式与民族的差异性，他们很难融合成同一民族、他们只能在竞争中求得生存发展。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n欧洲因为其地理环境所演化的社会形态，使得其难以形成统一民族，即地区身份的集体认同感，欧洲的地理因素注定其分裂与竞争是常态。而欧洲之所以能够形成以基督教文明为主体信仰，又在于基督教是作为一种超越的信仰得以成为欧洲的主体文化。民族竞争性与统一文化信仰，是欧洲之所以诞生资本主义社会形态的历史背景。\n\n### 资本制度的竞争性形成原因\n\n> “新制度主义经济学家提出这样一种简明的解释：欧洲地理的多样性，有利于形成独立的小国家或小共同体，有些小国家的统治者为了强化自己的竞争能力，通过无数次的尝试，逐渐形成这样的一些新的办法：采取吸引具有资本、技能和知识的人才政策，来增强自己的生产能力与财富。为了保护与留住资本与人才，他们进而发展出一套有效地、稳定地保护工商业、私有产权、个人创新自主性的制度环境。\n>\n> 例如威尼斯，热亚那，佛罗伦萨，尼德兰可以源源不断地吸引越来越多的资本与人才，从而使资本、人才、技术、劳动力结合起来，造成经济的进一步繁荣与国力的强盛。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n此处做进一步的描述补充：独立国家或者共同体的真正的竞争力体现在：通过一套保护私有产权以及个人创新自主性（也就是个人能动性）的社会制度，这套制度能够将资本、人才、技术和劳动力结合起来，形成一个良性的社会氛围。而这恰恰就是今天的我们，对于DAO的发展最为关键的诉求。\n\n### 资本主义的自我更新与演化\n\n> “这种资本主义的文化特点是：通过法律制度来保护私有产权，个人自由，无需特许的投资；另一方面，由商业派生出来的道德与价值观也逐渐在这种制度环境中发展出来——商人们学会了守时，诚实、以礼待人与守信用‘政府学会了按法律约束自己，不敢为所欲为，政府与公民双方都在这一互动过程中自我更新。\n>\n> 这种建立起资本主义性质新制度的国家数量不断扩大，最后达到了整个欧洲国家总数的临界多数，整个欧洲也由量变到质变，从封建社会演化为资本主义社会，欧洲各国的封建政治体制，逐步转向君子立宪政体和选举民主政体。\n>\n> 资本主义并不是预先根据某种理性原则的人为设计，而是人类在无意识的试错与适应环境过程中演变过来的。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n \n \n\n**正是多个共同体之间的互相竞争，形成了一套自我更新的“互动结构”，**而这套结构是保护了价值观对经济秩序的约束，例如商人的守时守信才能促进经济的良好发展。所以，正是具有自我更新能力的互动结构，通过其流动性的竞争力逐步扩大这一制度的共识，最终改变了欧洲社会的结构，推动了社会制度的全面改革。这正是DAO与DAO之间的竞争性也将必然上演的演化过程，而这个演化过程也必然是，共同体的自上而下推进制度创新，而全局整体性的自下而上的竞争演化。\n\n \n \n\n### 自主个体的用脚投票与优势流动\n\n> “共同体的小规模、分散性、自主性，有助于形成文化变异。更具体地说，只要一个社会板块中存在着分散的、独立自主的个体，这些个体总要竭尽自己的智能，追求自身的利益最大化，总是要运用自己可以独立支配的各种资源与潜能，来争取更好的存活机会，来应对复杂多变的环境挑战。\n>\n> 其次，小共同体彼此边界的开放性，有助于自主个体的横向流动性，正是这种跨政区的流动性，使得具有良好效能的小共同体的制度环境，对其他地区的个体具有更多的吸引力，自主的个体可以携带自己的优势竞争势能，通过用脚投票的权利，聚集到对自己更有利的地区去。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n \n \n\n实际上，这种人才根据自身诉求自由流动加入各种小共同体，正是当前DAO的发展所需要条件，而目前阻碍这个条件发生了，在于DAO的封闭性，以及无法携带自身优势与资源，进入到有利于自己的地区。所以，DAOs网络的存在，实际上就是对DAO的去中心化呈现。\n\n \n \n\n### 资本主义文明演化的七个重要的结构条件\n\n> “小规模性、多元性、分散性、个体自主性、流动性、边界开放性，以及在上述结构因素基础上的竞争性，是竞争性文明演化的重要结构条件，也是资本主义文明演化最为重要的结构条件。”\n>\n> 《走出天下秩序观》\n\n \n \n\n处于DAO发展早期，我们可以参考借鉴早期资本主义得以发展的关键因素，即**“小规模化、多元化、分散性、流动性、个体自主性、边界开放性、自由竞争性“**这几大核心因素。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M_qjH47NVIH86Mx88rHyd.png?height=274&width=934)\n\n当然，并不是我们要在DAOs进一步发展资本主义，而是去其糟粕取其精华，首先实现DAO在Web3阶段的突破性进化。每一个DAO即为一个小的共同体，那么DAO与DAO之间的从点到面的网络结构的特征以及性质，是我们现阶段可以借鉴的历史经验。\n\n \n  \n \n\n## DAOs网络的协议与业务结构关系\n\n### 去中心化协议支撑去中心化业务活动\n\nDAOs网络如何支撑各种活动实践，其基础是由去中心化治理协议所组成的去中心化协议网络。\n\n而在此之上，我认为应该建立三大关键的业务网络，去中心化的社交网络，去中心化的协作网络，去中心化的交易网络，通过这些开放性的网络来形成从资本到生产的去中心化的业务活动网络，这就是DAOs网络的网络结构。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WpVHizwkw8rvU094qqG1O.png?height=545&width=1080)\n\n实际上，去中心化的信息流，去中心化的任务流，以及去中心化的资金流，将作为一种模块化的功能组件实现业务的交互，也是对应胖协议的胖模块，因为在去中心化的网络结构当中，类似App等中心集成的架构形态将会改变，取而代之的便是去中心化的模块应用体现，而在当前交互硬件以手机为主流载体的时代，那么以Feeds为主要交互模式的流系胖模块将会是不可避免的趋势。 \n \n\n而DAPP的功能架构成更多成为一个兼容多种业务模块，可灵活插拔的框架，而针对协议聚合器则将成为管理与分发在不同业务网络的协议枢纽。**这种具有天然汇聚资源能力的枢纽，必定是兵家必争之地。**\n\n \n  \n \n\n## DAOs网络的去中心化协议聚合器\n\n### DAOs治理协议聚合器的作用\n\n随着一个DAO的大量实践的发展，那么一个DAO将同时发展出多条并行的业务线，并且每个业务线的业务模块都有不同的治理协议，这个时候，治理协议聚合器便发挥了关键的作用。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AJLx19dYUgAuh9hQfTPYH.png?height=699&width=1080)\n\n无论是DAO还是DAOer，协议聚合器将统一管理DAO所涉及到的业务活动相关的协议，协议聚合器不仅包括了活动业务相关的协议，也包括了治理制度相关的协议。\n\n例如，当前不少社区所采取的投票制度与投票流程规章，我们可以定义为罗伯特议事协议，而针对于DAO成员在业务活动过程中所获得数据产权关系，即所有权的保护协议，我们可以采用大陆法产权协议。 \n \n\n协议聚合器有效地实现了DAO与DAO之间的协议兼容性，由此可以实现，DAO与DAO之间进行业务合作，抵押借贷，人员迁移等，由此，我们将实现DAO的去中心化发展与演化逻辑。\n\n在DAOs网络当中，必然存在一些特殊的DAO进行DAOs网络流通的各种治理协议的研究，评测以及改进咨询，并为其他DAO提供合适其自身发展的治理框架以及治理协议。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nwmrzyt3RUVwlcAwvlWi6.png?height=502&width=1080)\n\n**这就意味着DAO的去中心化权力关系的制定机构的出现，而该机构不涉及到任何协议的执行过程，**去中心化的权力决策辅助机构的出现，意味着DAOs网络的权力关系中，决策权与执行权的分离，使得去中心化的权力关系得以实现。\n\n### DAOs治理协议聚合器：DAO劳动者的自由移民\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JMgjngdmSMR9ZYsuaOhgQ.png?height=1250&width=1080)\n\nDAO协议聚合器的出现，通过协议的兼容性与治理框架的同一性，实现了DAOer在不同的DAO之间可以自由的进入并且参与不同的业务活动，且自身所积累的治理优势也将得以保留。\n\n这就是去中心化治理协议在DAOs网络当中得以应用的优势，由此该模式解决了当前DAO的参与者获得真正的自由。\n\n \n \n\n### DAOs治理协议聚合器：DAO如何自由公平地分叉\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wXhw2nbaqEZqU_F0dlOwy.png?height=786&width=1080)\n\nDAO的分叉是共识的分叉，而分叉的关键就是协议聚合器的重新配置。其中，治理框架的制度协议是分叉的关键，\n\n例如：\n\n1. 根据奥威尔1984制度协议规定，为了尊重个人主权的意志，以及对抗极端集权的垄断式统治危机，任何人都将可以发起DAO的分叉提案；\n2. 根据罗伯特议事协议规定，分叉方案的利益相关人，超过1/3的赞同即可实现DAO的分叉，并启动分叉相关的协议流程；\n3. 根据大陆法产权协议，保护分叉任意双方的数据所有权，并秉持尽可能的所有权原则，公共资产需要根据所有权协议进行重新的分配\n\n \n \n\n由此，基于去中心化治理协议的DAO分叉活动，将完整保护了利益相关方的资产利益，而协议聚合器的存在，又将使得DAO的合并兼容提供了可行性。\n\n因为，基于去中心化治理协议的协议聚合器，在DAOs网络当中，起到了举足轻重的作用，也是未来DAOs网络建设当中，重要的资源枢纽，甚者比交易所还要更加重要。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n## 基于开放式Loot范式的可组合NFTs\n\n### 基于Loot范式的NFTs业务拓展方式\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7WEWGbM-su8AdRMPhwE6.png?height=701&width=1080)\n\n随着基础业务的拓展，与业务相关的治理协议也需要跟着业务的拓展而拓展，例如一个核心业务模块，由于用户规模以及业务细分的发展趋势，会进一步形成围绕核心业务的多个子业务出现，面对这一需求，我们可以通过Loot范式的组合NFTs来实现。\n\n正如图中示例，在去中心化的社交媒体随着业务的发展，进一步拓展出主题推文讨论，内容共创，以及创作激励等， 不同的业务模块在功能交互层面存在不同的数据类型，由此治理协议与交互数据形成新的子协议进行治理。\n\n根据不同子协议所定义的NFT作用与权益，例如人气王，敏捷，赏金猎人-铂金等不同的定义，形成了影响力NFTs的集合，并在NFTs的聚合器当中体现。\n\n### 基于Loot范式的可拓展协议业务流程\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-JMhePDJvedEPrOOMyBfr.png?height=979&width=1080)\n\n随着用户在业务网络的各种活动需求，在不同业务模块当中所产生的数据，都可以经过数据产权协议进行权益的划分，例如数据的使用权，租赁权或抵押权等等。\n\n数据本身作为一种原料资源，需要经过业务加工，协议赋权，才能得以在整个生产关系网络当中发挥价值。需要重点关注的是，治理协议赋予了元数据的产权权利，而治理协议的规则定义，则是对产权形成了赋能与约束的作用。 \n \n\n正如相比于传统的网文平台对创作者做签订的不平等条约，基于DAOs网络的产权协议将彻底保障作者内容的所有权，以及后续 一系列的商业变现，本质都是对其内容权利的商业变现。\n\n这就是Web3数据所有权回归运动当中，数据实现价值变现的关键所在。而一切真正Web3的金融模型与商业模式，也都将建立在以此基础之上。\n\n \n \n\n### 基于Loot范式的NFTs协议聚合器\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2hN2BQOT8HQJthtx_xhfA.png?height=611&width=1080)\n\n由于子业务的扩展，那么协议聚合器也将进一步兼容业务的扩容需求，基于Loot范式的NFTs协议聚合器，将包括子业务的协议，子业务的NFT，子业务的治理Token，以及子业务的元数据。\n\n而基于该模式的协议聚合器，具有极大的潜力，我们将在下文进一步探讨。\n\n \n \n\n### Loot范式的解析：再生产结构的二重性\n\nLoot是一种基于文本结构的NFT，其特点是纯文字通过字段的符号定义，通过社区的想象力得以实现自下而上的演化与发展，而基于可组合协议的NFT，即多个NFT可以组合成为一个NFT，在这里定义为NFTs。 \n \n\n基于Loot范式的NFTs意味着Loot文本结构中的标签可以是组合性，而不是再是随机性的，进一步则意味着文本结构与标签的可扩展性，我们可以通过这个功能结构建立一套链上的语义以及符号系统。\n\n在原本的Loot范式中，Loot是随机生成的固定的“文本就结构与字符内容”，而社区的创作者们从故事表达上，可以通过个人或集体的想象力以及创造力，构建了Lootverse(loot元宇宙），当Loot与程序化艺术生成结合时，**Loot本质就是一个链上交互指令的脚本，通过符号系统实现了对想象世界的构建。**\n\n这一过程，实际上形成了，**客观经验世界与主观意向世界，通过交互媒介实现，具体与抽象的互相建设，这一过程实际上可称为建构的二重性，即loot的生产结构二重性。**\n\n### Loot范式的重构：语义符号的离散随机系统\n\n符号系统是一种离散随机系统，而Loot范式的符号系统却是停滞的，因此会导致底层涌现的动力不足。\n\nloot范式是一个封闭的，且有限的符号系统，其原因在于无法新增新的根符号与根字段，而在原来的设计理念中，也缺乏外部性的条件实现对根符号与根字段的添加。\n\n虽然可以通过版本迭代的方式，实现对符号字段的新增，但符号系统的演化过程是一个动态发展随机系统，因此需要找到一个合理的外部生产条件来实现其根结构的可发展性。 \n \n\n而基于去中心化治理协议的子业务，基于Loot范式的NFTs生产结构为打开Loot范式原本的桎梏提供了可能，由此我们得以彻底激活Loot范式的真正潜力。\n\nLoot规范的标签类型可扩展，字段符号的可扩展，层级叠加的扩展，总而言之，基于开放式Loot范式的可组合NFTs协议系统，使得我们得以实现**链上原生的语义符号的离散随机系统，我们将真正获得涌现的力量。**\n\n### 基Loot范式的NFTs如何形成文化秩序\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m68wE9UbBmUzgziVCnhh9.png?height=485&width=1080)\n\n关于文化对社会秩序的影响，我们可以考古到远古部落时期，祭祀仪式的作为一种原始信仰的统治，而随着封建王朝的出现，祭祀仪式逐渐转互为一种约束行为的“礼”的道德治理手段。\n\n**文化秩序是社会管理的最高准则**，一切法律的制定都要依据社会道德的公约。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kzc6xOLKwh91I7vTb2V9z.png?height=684&width=1080)\n\n语言作为文化传播与发展的重要符号，即作为一种人与人之间进行交流的沟通媒介，文化通过符号媒介出现，但其本身存在于集体的“语言共同体”当中，频繁的交流动作，相当于持续地丰富“共有知识库”，以及优化沟通表达的“阐释框架”的表达效率，进而将原本抽象而模糊的情境表达，逐步提炼成为具体的符号动作。\n\n群体共有的文化是整体共识的体现，共有知识是共识的全部因素，阐释框架是共识的表达形式，Loot范式的NFTs的文本符号表达结构，承载了“诠释框架”的功能，而随着业务拓展的而持续增加的符号字段，成为集体的共有知识，在发生业务的情境与交互当中持续发展。 \n \n\n下面讲举例一个文化案例的体现\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kM5K55coBAlYmVipoRSmc.png?height=715&width=1080)\n\n仁、义、礼是儒家文化的精髓，而这三者之间的关系是：“仁”是内心的德性；“义”是形式的义务；“礼”是外在的规范；“仁”是你内心的道德品质；“义”是你去做道德上应该做的事情；“礼”是一套制约你行为的社会伦理规范通过这个文化互动模型的结构合并，我们可以看到儒家文化，是如何通过该互动结构得以实现一种文化具象的呈现，而NFTs上所呈现的每一个字段，又将通过治理协议与交互媒介，融入到整个DAOs网络的治理过程当中。\n\n \n **文化通过结构的二重性，在持续形成结构化的过程中，实现了与真实客观实现的持续交互与经验映射。**\n\n我们时常谈“仁义”道德，实际上是“仁”与“义”的两个思想种子的融合，形成了我们日常情境与广泛语义上的一种儒家道德观。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0MnKpQWBS5NJwcO5L4o9Z.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n随着“仁”与“义”在现实场景中的不断交互与相容，我们在逐渐形成“仁义”的道德理念，并通过文化符号展现出来。由于该文字符号都是基于协议的交互规则的定义体现，因此仁，义，乃至仁义的相关动作都可以获得治理Token，也就说，在业务设计足够合理的情况下，我们定义了仁义道德的行为，并由此赋予相应的对象，获得相关的不可转让的治理权力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MYdfEfkGr5sqcpii2rkCw.png?height=681&width=1080)\n\n当然，这仅仅是一个例子，事实上，随着这套机制与系统的完善，我们会看到更多文化治理的思想得以应用。总而言之，通过开放性的Loot范式的组合NFTs与结构的二重性，我们在客观经验世界的文化道德得以进入数字世界并得到演化。\n\n通过以上结构与模型，我们解决了兼容了文化道德的，根据DAO自身的共识需求而得到实现的文化秩序的道德治理。\n\n### 基于Loot范式的NFTs实现VIBE的可创造性\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i1L0m4bcoPPuOXCo0IOlK.png?height=698&width=1080)\n\n通过我们对文化治理协议的结构与模式探讨，我们可以获得一种定义VIBE的视野，即**VIBE是对特定的符号动作进行大量的有效实践**，而同时作为一种可被观察到的文化叙事的实践方式的过程，所呈现的一种可被感知的状态。\n\nVIBE的内在特征是促进并提升个体的能动性，使得治理协议的交互媒介得到最大化的使用，进而大量获得与使用治理Token，其中，NFTs的作为阐释框架在不同情境的生成过程，是VIBE作为被可具体观察到的过程状态的截面。\n\n由此，VIBE不再是虚无缥缈的感知氛围，而是可以通过具体手段与明确监测到的一种可持续创造现象。\n\n## 第五部分：机遇\n\n## 基于DAOs网络的去中心化商业模式\n\n### 构建产权分配的经济共同体\n\n从过去的社会经济的发展经验中，例如土地产权的制度，从集体生产所有到家庭承包责任制，极大地改变了土地生产粮食的效率以及个体的劳动盈余。而一个DAO的经济模型的设计，必然离不开其产权制度的设计，一个缺乏产权制度的DAO是不完整的，产权制度是对共同劳动结果的确权保障，由此，产权残缺的经济模型必然会导致生产性活动的降低。\n\n不可能所有的DAO都是投资DAO，而公共资产管理也仅仅是DAO的主要功能之一，Web3的DAO需要将劳动力资源尽可能导向生产性的活动，以此提高Web3的正外部性以及DAO的可持续发展的经济绩效。\n\n**产权制度与经济模型，两者是一体化的经济系统**，这是DAO真正有效开启生产性活动且能够长期运营的关键所在。缺少产权制度的DAO，仅仅是获得薪酬的DAO，对于大多数人而言，那经济效益甚至不如加入一家公司；\n\n### 解决X2Earn与Xfi的产权残缺\n\n目前大量打着Web3旗号的Xfi与X2E项目，这类项目的经济模型，本质上是庞氏经济模型与Staking经济的融合变种，缺乏对用户数据所有权的价值体现，缺乏对用户数据产权的有效激励，Web3的主旨是产权回归，不符合这个主旨的都不是Web3项目。\n\nX2E与XFi的有效正外部性是什么？我一直认为这是一个好问题。一个经济体的有效正外部性，一定是源自于发生了更多的生产性活动，以及外部市场的交易活动。X2E与XFi项目的弊端源自于以代币价值为核心，而非以生产价值为核心。一旦注入项目的资金被抽离市值暴跌，那么用户本质就是被割的韭菜，实际上事实也如此。 \n \n\n基于Loot范式的可组合NFTs有助于将业务流程与相关数据进行确权并让用户具有产权的自主分离权能，进一步将自身的数据租赁给平台或者其他。而**目前典型的X2E与XFi项目中，是默认占据了所有权的所有权能，用户仅仅只获得其抵押的激励收益。** \n \n\n### 基于DAO治理协议的经济模型\n\n数据作为Web3的核心资源，数据资源的产权制度是Web3经济模型的根基，所以，在设计Web3的商业模型时，需要同时兼容“产权制度—经济模型-商业模式”的一体化结构。 \n \n\n基于loot范式的组合NFTs来实现产权的分配，在每一个项目的发起时，需要具体划分每一个参与决策需要承担的工作内容，并确定其权重比例。当相关角色正式参与到项目活动中，该角色即可获得代表该产权的NFTs，无论是空投还是mint。\n\n参与者的劳动结果要基于该NFTs进行确权上链，并根据工作结果获得该NFTs的治理代币，而该代币可用于权益经济的激励。除去特殊的文化治理的不可转让的NFT，产权NFTs与经济模型的集合，使得NFTs获得了价值捕获以及更大的流动性。 \n \n\n例如，当一个项目获得较高市场关注度时且具有未来可预期的现金流，那么产权所有者可以将自身的NFTs的收益权分离为一组NFT进行租赁或者抵押。Loot范式的可组合NFTs与协议聚合器让个人掌握了产权与经济变现的主动权。将NFTs进行子NFT的分离并与经济权益挂钩，例如购买具有收益权的NFTs，每固定周期即可获得一定的收益回报，既可以是代币，也可以是权益。 \n \n\n## 基于DAOs网络的个人发展机会\n\n### 设计自己的工作流\n\n实际上，在DAOs网络当中，你将是为了自己而工作，因为你所生产的数据在产权治理协议的保护下，将成为你个人重要的资产，这些资产本身能够给你带来持续的收益。由于DAOs网络的去中心化的优势，DAO的NFTs聚合器的出现，使得我们可以自由参与到多个DAO的劳动生产当中，产权协议保护下的生产力流动性，是DAOs网络一个极具优势的特征。\n\n由于**你将来是面向DAOs网络提供劳动价值，因此你将可以设计自己的工作流，并将该流程模块化**，工作流程的模块化意味着你可以将你的生产力得到更多分散的机会，使得你的收益渠道是一种结构性的收入，而不是单一渠道的收入。\n\n对于个人而言，基于Loot范式的NFTs将使得你的劳动生产获得投资的可能。例如你要创作一部小说，你可以通过NFTs进行具体产权的分离，你将可以发行多个具有收益权的NFTs用于写作的投资，而获得NFTs的投资人也将获得你未来小说发行，以及影视改版等商业收入，你与NFTs持有者将形成利益共同体，并成为一个DAO的组织形态。 \n \n\n在Loot范式的可组合NFTs这一模型下，设计自己的工作流等于设计自己的商业模式，**个人也许将成为一个超级商业个体**，设想哈利波特的作者JK罗琳假如采用了这套模式，也许她个人就是一个比肩传媒巨头的超级商业个体。\n\n每个人都将得以探索属于自己的职业路线，这样的未来很值得期待。\n\n### 个人产权的投资布局\n\nDAOs网络改变了传统的劳动雇佣关系，这也意味着薪酬革命的到来。你在DAOs网络的劳动不仅获得货币作为劳动报酬，更重要是你所参与的劳动的产权凭证以及未来的收益潜力，才是你重要而财富来源。\n\n传统公司制度的股票和期权在没上市前就空气和泡沫，而能够成功上市的企业并维持良好市值的实在稀疏可数，所以传统公司制度早已不满足现代人的工作收益需求，当缺乏更好地通过劳动获得财富滚雪球复利效应的渠道时，人们就会涌向投机市场，进一步形成了经济泡沫。\n\n基于DAOs网络的产权基于协议的流动性，具有了经济网络的规模效应，这为个人产权提供了新的增长市场，基于DAOs网络的经济规模效应，个人的产权如同股票一样，具有了投资回报的经济效益。\n\n所以，当我们决定参与到某个DAO的项目时，也要考虑评估其在产权分配上，你所能够获得的权益NFT，该权益的收益权的时效，以及是否可交易等，这些都成为重要的评估条件，而缺乏劳动产权制度DAO则成为失去优秀人才的参与。\n\n**当你投身某个DAO的劳动时，你的劳动产权就开始了铸造**，NFTs聚合器也将成为你管理劳动产权收益的主要工具。 \n \n\n### 影响力即共识，共识即品牌\n\n尽可能构建个人影响，获得更多的共识，是个人品牌价值最大化的方式。而在DAOs网络当中，个人影响力的构建不再是虚假繁荣的指标，有效的影响力将通过各种影响力协议实现数据的跟踪与确权，进而获得相关的治理Token，影响力将成为个人有效的共识体现，意味着获得在DAOs网络的各种权益优势。\n\n个人可以发行自己的NFTs，建立自己影响力人脉网络，我认为这也是DAOs网络存在可能性机遇，这也将完全颠覆了过往以雇佣方与公司利益为主体的商业体系。一切都在朝着超级个体的方向发展。\n\n## 基于DAOs网络的社群发展模式\n\n### 社群与社区的区别\n\nCrypto的社区顺理成章地成为DAO的发育土壤，然而我们还是十分有必要区分，社群与社区的区分。\n\n相比于社区，社群是人员结构扁平的组织，在主题明确的交流环境下，人群具有更高的互动交流的频率，在以IM功能结构的互联网环境中，社群往往是社区的组成单位。如果从功能呈现上来说，**社区相比于社群更多时候是一个抽象整体但边界清晰的存在**，因为社区的核心是身份认同的归属感，这也是很多社区发行PFP的原因，但是真正的身份认同感并非来自于花钱每一个身份证，而是源自于所处环境在文化活动上的密切交流。\n\n实际上，在目前的社交产品当中，社群才是支撑人群在网络交流互动的主要渠道。对于中国地区的网民来说，相比于社区文化，我们拥有最佳的社群文化的土壤，社群文化才是构成我们生活与工作的重要部分，所以，当我们在讨论DAO与社区的发展关系时，其实DAO与社群可能是更优的发展关系。 \n \n\n### 社群在互动结构上的优势\n\n社群在人员的互动结构上有着极大的优势，因为每一个成员都共享一个IM的聊天窗，这不仅意味着聊天的全程透明化，而其他的协同例如转账，接龙等群功能的展示是直观的。\n\n这种交互功能上的扁平化，形成了群友在活动执行上的互动结构的扁平化，这种扁平化的优势在交流效率与传递效率上远比社区高很多，其次高频次的交流更有助于文化氛围的形成，而无需刻意采取品牌影响的方式经营社区品牌文化。\n\n社群的功能结构更有助于小群体的紧密联系，而未来的DAO的生产性活动还是以小群体为主流，无论是因为链上性能限制，还是线上协同，敏捷有默契的小团队文化会是DAO主流规模。\n\n### 社群是DAO的最佳启动方式\n\n社群的扁平互动结构是DAO的天然土壤，每一社群都可以天生成为一个DAO，无论是交流还是活动的协同，相比于庞大复杂的社区拥有着更大的灵活优势。因为在DAOs网络当中，劳动者主要面向DAOs网络服务获得并积累个人产权与资产，DAO的功能形态更加适应了灵活自由的协同方式，意味着可以和DAOs网络上，采用相同治理协议的劳动者进行自由灵活的组队，形成一个围绕项目生产的DAO，项目结束后即可解散，而基于NFTs的治理协议与产权证明又可以灵活地随时将其召回。\n\n社群如何建立共识并凝聚价值，这个才是社群进阶成为DAO的关键所在。简单描述下，基于Loot范式的可组合NFTs是如何实现一个社群的共识凝聚以及可持续发展。\n\n*1，在Loot的NFTs的功能定义，确定身份标签，根据生产技能划分身份职能；*\n\n*2，一个社群可能有多次活动以及每次活动有多个业务，那么进一步添加项目标签与任务标签；*\n\n*3，制定一个治理Token的分配制度，从任务权重以及任务完成度作为核心考虑，治理Token为不可转让因此不具备数字货币的功能，仅作为治理权重转化经济权益的计量指标，因此符合法律规定并不是发行数字货币。*\n\n*4，治理Token本身具有可编程功能，因此可以随着投票共识决定往什么方向升级；*\n\n*5，建立Loot范式的NFTs知识库，该知识库作为NFTs的功能定义，以及业务活动的相关规则的记录等等，每个标签，每个字段的含义等等，并确权上链进行开源。*\n\n*6，建立一套基于该NFTs知识库的阐释框架，根据该阐述框架可以决定哪些字段标签组合而成的NFTs具备哪些职能以及权利； \n *\n\n完成以上的关键步骤，一方面解决了DAO参与者的产权制度，其次共有知识与诠释框架的设计，该NFTs将同时具有产权价值，协议功能，以及社群互动过程的文化属性；这样的使得治理协议的规则约定可以根据业务情况进行调整，也大大提高了治理的容错率。 \n \n\n基于这个治理结构的设计流程，再进一步采用各种投票工具，或者治理的规则约定，例如需要具备哪些条件的成员获得什么样的投票资格，这些就是目前业内普遍常用的治理工具了。\n\n总结来说，目前DAO的治理工具与治理规则缺乏了基础底层的支撑，进而造成了因为业务发展脱离早期治理的规则时，都不可避免面临发展的困境。\n\n## 第七部分：参与\n\n## DAOs构建全球去中心化的协同网络\n\nDAOs几乎聚合了Web3所有的关键技术，或者某种程度上来说，我认为DAOs网络才是Web3得以真正发展建设的方向，DID为我们提供了DAOs网络的自由身份，去中心化治理协议实现了去中心化制度管理，NFTs的普及与应用得以让产权资源在DAOs网络当中实现价值捕获。\n\n我们一直都认可DAO是人类协同的新方式，我们也希望DAOs网络是全人类的协同网络，DAOs网络应该是自由的，公平的，开放的，全球每个人都可以在DAOs网络当中自由地工作。\n\nDAOs网络将永久性地改变全球的劳动力市场，全球化的自由协同意味着基于全球加密经济的市场规模因为生产力的介入而得到爆发性的增长，当全球几十亿人都在DAOs网络自由地就业，同时还能保护个人的数据产权，或许这将诞生新的经济体系。\n\n## 发展中国家制定符合DAO发展的法律\n\n如果你在当前的法律框架中探讨DAO的合规性发展，你会发现基本无解。**难道因为各国政策法律的规定，比特币就得改成合规比特币吗？比特币还是那个比特币。**我们最好的方式是说服某个国家或者地区，延续采用阿连德政府关于控制论的社会主义制度，而这一次我们采用的是DAOs的应用模式，其治理协议就是法律条文在DAOs的应用体现。如果我们局限于DAO与公司制的等同实体，那么狭隘的视野就会造成目前大多数DAO所面临的困境。\n\nDAO的真正先驱与领导者，捍卫DAO的去中心化而迟迟不做法律实体的绑定，并不在于合规化的操作不能，而是在于这些决策将会导致DAO完全往另一个方向发展，具有公司法律实体的DAO本质是DAC——去中心化的自治公司。DAC与DAO是两个不同的物种，**当你在现有法律框架进行DAO合规性时，那严谨说辞应该是，一个DAO转型做了DAC**。你不能再自称作为一个DAO，退下吧！\n\n目前可看到的关于DAO合规性的文章基本千篇一律，未来几年大概也是如此。\n\nDAO的真正合规性的发展路线，是基于DAOs网络将法律条文逐步通过治理协议实现。DAOs网络是全球化的网络，那么国际法纳入DAOs网络的治理协议，才是DAO的合规化方向。这就是我们为何需要在落后的发展中国家寻求合规化的探索。第三世界才是我们的探索DAO合规化的真正出路。\n\n**农村包围城市，同志们！**\n\n## 全球发展中国家的制度改革浪潮兴起\n\n我们从互联网的数据奴隶解放成为数据的产权所有者，Web3的产权回归运动通过DAOs网络，让大量的数据无产阶级成为数据的有产阶级。而产权意识的兴起，也将让劳动者选择有利于自己的劳动力市场，逐步抛弃原本旧的经济制度。\n\n所有权共同体以及去中心化治理协议的应用，极大地约束并降低了资本对无产阶级的剥削力度，自由资本市场的经济规则或许将得到改写，构建自主产权的新兴经济体将成为新的世界浪潮。基于Web3思想的数字经济制度，将不再按照互联网巨头所塑造的数字资本主义的经济制度。 \n \n\nDAOs网络的形成势必形成新的产权经济制度，发展中国家为了获得更具优势的经济竞争力，将比发达国家更有动力进行经济制度的改革，乃至社会制度的改革。加密货币席卷了全球金融证券市场，而DAOs网络则将彻底席卷全球的劳动生产力市场。 \n \n\n## 探索新生文明：元宇宙原生社会形态\n\nDAOs构建了一个社会系统的基本雏形，从身份认同，加密货币，任务协同包括文化系统等等，我们逐步实现了现实社会与数字社会的融合，并兼容了我们广义上的宗教，政治，经济等等，我们通过技术力量实现了一种原生的社会形态，开启了人类赖以生存的新的疆域。\n\n对于Metaverse的原生社会形态，既是我们现有一切社会学的整合，也是一切“元社会学”的起点，因为在过去的社会学当中，理性的现实主义的学者大多洞察现实社会的根本规律，然而在Metaverse的社会理念中，**浪漫的人文主义也许将会大放光彩**，文化通过符号的视觉呈现，基于文化的可再创造系统，精神世界对物质世界的大融合，人类的文明会有更多全新的故事涌现。\n\n## DAOs to World的使命愿景\n\n### DAOs to World是一个超越社区的发展共同体\n\n在全球一百多个国家/地区，建设以Web3产权保护制度为核心的DAOs网络，变革自工业革命以来，以控制论与旧制度资本主义所创造的现代化劳动分工市场，打破以全球自由资本主义制度所控制的全球经济秩序。我们将帮助大量落后的，以及发展中国家/地区的人民，**摆脱资本对其剩余价值的剥削**，以及对其劳动生产能力的异化。\n\n \n \n\n我们将守护全球50亿人口拥有自由的身份进入未来数字社会的身份权利，**让更多无产阶级成为有产阶级，进而实现真正意义上的“自由的，平等的，正义的”**，我们将避免数字资本主义所缔造的赛博朋克意识形态，实现对人类数字文明社会的控制，即通过巨大的数字利维坦巨兽，掌控并奴役人类的劳动生产。\n\n \n \n\n我们将致力于创造一个发挥人类本真性的反利维坦世界，并将打破工具理性对人类过去数百年来的心灵束缚，我们将创造与一个“天赋人权”的一种内在自我的认同与肯定，重视人类的情感与共情的和谐社会，构建真正求同存异的多元文化大社会，凝聚人类命运共同体的共识之心。\n\n \n \n\n**DAOs to World的共识之心，是人类的思想，情感，文化等力量的汇聚。**\n\n### 如何加入DAOs to World并获取共识之心NFT\n\nDAOs网络是Metaverse的原生社会雏形，也是未来全球新的协同秩序，当DAOs趋近成熟时，所有人都可以加入，正如跨链的意义在于建立多链网络的互通，而DAO与DAO之间也是如此趋势，无论是底层技术或者社会规律，都预示了DAOs网络的必然出现。\n\n \n

DYDX/DeversiFi \n 1.1 空投回顾\n\nDYDX空投分配方案 \n DYDX空投分配方案 \n 大约是从DYDX开始，空投的规则变得复杂起来。项目方为不同资金量的用户设置了不同的等级（门槛）。\n\nDeversiFi空投分配方案 \n DeversiFi空投分配方案 \n DeversiFi成功吸取了在DYDX的经验，在设置资金门槛的基础上，还增加了活跃度的门槛，这一规则一直被沿用至现在，包括OP、Across（已提案）在内的各项目方的空投方案都在参考这样的方法。\n\n1\\.2 启示 \n 面对DEFI或跨链桥等需要一定资金的项目时，我们可以通过Dune、Footprint来跟踪项目的交易量，想办法让每个钱包的交易额/跨链量超过一定比例的用户，达到某一个门槛。同时也不要忘记至少每周使用一次要空投的项目，并在各个链上留有一定的资金（大约5-10刀）\n\n1\\.3 实战案例：找到门槛 \n 使用dune查看nomad跨链桥的状态：\n\nDune \n Dune \n Blockchain ecosystem analytics by and for the community. Explore and share data from Ethereum, xDai, Polygon, Optimism, BSC and Solana for free. \n [dune.com](http://dune.com/) \n 这里我们可以直接引用用户0xroll已经做好的nomad链上分析，这里我们只需要点击\\[Nomad Recent Transactions\\]这一栏，然后把出来的代码分叉到自己的dune里面，修改一下要查找的交易记录，比如改为1000笔，就能轻松找出大多数人跨链时用了多少资金了。\n\n稍微懂一点代码的朋友可以用截图中的方法，也是由@gm365.eth无私提供 \n 稍微懂一点代码的朋友可以用截图中的方法，也是由@gm365.eth无私提供 \n 关于Dune的具体使用方法，可以看看@gm365.eth的教程，我这里只是一个取巧的办法。\n\ngm365.eth \n gm365.eth \n 🌞 ☕️ gm 学习、反思、输出、翻译、分享高质量内容，in Web3 World 🌍 \n mirror.xyz \n 以上只是从资金方面做了分析，活跃度上，我们还需要保持每周一次以上的交互。\n\n1. Paraswap/HOP \n 2.1 空投回顾 \n 项目方需要羊毛党的交互的数据，羊毛党需要项目方的空投，两者真正的相爱相杀可能要从Paraswap开始算起，在HOP发币时达到一个巅峰。\n\nPSP非常严格的空投标准 \n PSP非常严格的空投标准 \n PSP发币前一直在利用空投PUA用户，拿到融资后立刻执行了更加严格的空投方案——通过修改空投方案，光明正大地把许多用户归为空投猎人，一个币也不给。这让许多普通用户也被反撸，导致了大量的不满，其代币也在空投后在不断地贬值，这个故事在HOP上延续着。\n\nHOP空头标准，资金量和LP是重点 \n HOP空头标准，资金量和LP是重点 \n 虽然后来的OP也同样不欢迎女巫，但是HOP让用户相互举报女巫的行为可谓是所有空投标准中的“集大成”者，这一次许多撸毛党都栽在了这里。\n\n区块律动上的一篇案例分析 \n 区块律动上的一篇案例分析 \n 2.2 启示 \n 2.2.1 避免资金归集。\n\n目前来看，使用交易所归集、分发是最稳妥、省钱的方法，需要注意的是，存款的时候应该存入子账号，避免全部转入相同地址后被认定为女巫。\n\n2\\.2.2 混肴操作。\n\n根据早先一些被举报案例的报道，项目方主要通过资金归集、操作相似、时间相同、社交网络泄露地址并被举报等方式来鉴定女巫。\n\n所以我们的在交互的时候至少应该避免以上的操作方式，同时还应该具备一定的前瞻性，把IP、浏览器痕迹（cookie）都考虑进来。\n\n2\\.3 实战案例 \n 2.3.1 账号隔离\n\n这里介绍一下我自己防女巫的操作方法：\n\n我的操作方式 \n 我的操作方式 \n a.使用多台电脑，每台电脑使用不同的VPN，保证IP不重复，平常使用chrome浏览器，且不接受任何cookie，用不同的谷歌账号开子浏览器管理钱包\n\nb.每个谷歌账号中只有一套助记词（方便管理），助记词下配一个精撸账号（即有ENS、有大量交易纪录等）和5个以内的子钱包（可以互相转账，方便操作），组成一个钱包集\n\nc.钱包集之间互相不能转账，严格隔离\n\nd.一般情况下不使用批量刷的软件，一是保证钱包安全，二是避免被女巫\n\ne.不明来源文件使用虚拟机打开，浏览器精简不必要的插件，不要心怀侥幸。\n\n2\\.3.2 交易所相关操作\n\na.归集资金\n\n中心化交易所仍然是最方便的跨链/隐私协议，资金归集的时候可以使用OKX、币安、FTX这些交易所。但是你的交易所钱包是固定的，所以归集资金时应该创建子账号，不同钱包集的资金打入不同的账号。\n\nb.分发资金\n\n我最近开始使用Layerswap来分撒资金，这是一个为交易所提供跨链功能的DAPP归集\n\n交易所跨链项目Layeswap \n 交易所跨链项目Layeswap \n 使用这个DAPP，你需要获得交易所的API，注册Bransfer和Layerswap账户，步骤挺繁琐，但是不排除空投的可能，所以既然要转账，不如试试看。\n\n篇幅有限，具体方法就不介绍了，这里找到一个参考的教程，时间有点早了，不保障完全可用。作者好像是@baikaishui，未仔细核实。\n\nLayerSwap交互教程 \n LayerSwap交互教程 \n 背景：使用LayerSwap，您可以将加密货币从您的加密货币交换账户直接发送到第2层网络，而无需支付高昂的Gas费用。支持的网络包括Arbitrum，Optimism，zkSync，Boba和Ronin（Axie Infinity）。 \n mirror.xyz \n 当然，你也可以使用zkMoney归集资金，这也是一个必刷的协议，这类金融类产品最好增加交互的金额，提高你的空投权重（如果有的话）。\n\nzk.money · Private DeFi has arrived! \n zk.money · Private DeFi has arrived! \n Checkout zk.money by @aztecnetwork. Private DeFi is here. 🕵️. \n zk.money \n 2.3.3 操作随机\n\n我们的交互至少应该做到部分随机，以我自己为例，相同的交互操作每天只能在两个钱包集以内的账号上完成，且做到以下几点：\n\na.避免交互后立即反向操作，如跨链后立即跨回，交易usdt后立即买回原来的币\n\nb.时间随机，一个钱包集交互后暂停一天以上的时间再做其他操作，如跨链后间隔三天再回到其他链\n\nc.每个账户使用的金额完全随机，如有的钱包使用1eth交互，有的钱包使用0.2eth交互\n\n1. Optimism \n 3.1 空投回顾\n\n原文链接：<https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/#active-ethereum-participants> \n 原文链接：<https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/#active-ethereum-participants> \n 有PSP和HOP的前车之鉴，Optimism的空投方案可谓是集大成者，既照顾了普通用户，也没有对羊毛党赶尽杀绝，很好的达到了项目方推广自己代币的同时又回馈忠实用户的目的\\~\\~，可惜被WinterMute玩崩了\\~\\~。\n\n可以看到，OP作为一个由DAO构成的L2公链，十分注重链上公益行为。\n\n这里我们把空投方案的细则一条条拉出来详细讲解。\n\n3\\.2 启示 \n 3.2.1 链上投票\n\n这个没什么好说的，经常参与各个项目的投票，可能会收获意想不到的福报。\n\na.在Layer0上面质押STG参与投票，虽然Stargate已经发币，但是Layer0作为一个公链，不发币是很难维持开支的。类似的操作\n\nb.OP认可的链上投票有：Coumpound、Aave、Curve、Maker、Aragon\n\n3\\.2.2 多签\n\n多签账户不仅能获得额外的空投，而且还有一些豁免权，项目方在各方面的标准都会降低一些，这类账户一般是由DAO的领导者持有。但是也不一定，兔子洞推荐的Gnosis Safe就很适合大家，我们完全可以自己发起一个DAO，然后以DAO的身份参与各种项目。\n\n需要注意的是，OP对多签的要求是链上交易数量要超过10条，未来的空投可能还会继续提高门槛。所以，关于交易数……你懂吧。\n\ngnosis-safe的玩法很多，这里不细说，只做一个小建议，用电脑配手机gnosis app+ metamask app的方式组成两个多签人为一组的多签账号，会比较方便。\n\n3\\.2.3Gitcoin捐赠\n\n这个没什么好说的，在主网交易可以增加交易数量，并且以后可能很多L2项目是不认zksync的捐赠的，想去zksync上省钱的自己注意别捐错了就好。\n\n3\\.2.4 主网交互者\n\n还是那句话，OP是一个注重公益行为的公链，所以保持在主网上的交易记录是一个很好的习惯，缺点就是真的挺贵的，每周等gas低的时候随便。据某社区大神们的推荐，主网上最便宜的操作应该是：走zks官方桥、刷approve、gitcoin捐款、领noox徽章、free mint图狗等。\n\n3\\.2.5 交互的资金量\n\n对比其他空投标准，我们会发现，像OP这样的公链+DAO，对交互的资金是没有要求的，而DEFI类本身就带有金融属性的项目，会考虑你交互的金额。\n\n3\\.3 实战案例 \n 3.3.1 一鱼多吃\n\n这个交互方法很早就有了，@丰密应该是这方面的集大成者，他的这篇教程推荐大家都去看看\n\n10美金一肉多吃交互+持有顶级蓝筹NFT：zora+party+rabbithole+BAYC无聊猿 \n 10美金一肉多吃交互+持有顶级蓝筹NFT：zora+party+rabbithole+BAYC无聊猿 \n 作者：丰密 \n mirror.xyz \n 很多交互工作我们可以放在一块来做，例如通过Gnosis创建一些ARB和主网的多签账户，然后参与投票、捐赠、刷主网数据、完成noox成就等工作。虽然有点费Gas，但是摇身一变，成为DAO负责人，是有可能让你在未来获得超额的收益的。\n\n关于多签的玩法还有很多，比如Utopia、coinshift，以及一些DAO工具，考虑到一些不安全因素，需要大家自己去探索，这里就算是抛砖引玉了。\n\n重要提醒：多签账户的地址仅支持一个公链，不同的公链请一定创建不同的多签账户，千万不要做WinterMute那样的傻事。\n\n3\\.3.2 zkSync交互\n\nzkSync是肯定有大毛的，建议全方位、多角度地交互。\n\na.zkSync 1.0 （必做）\n\n基本操作：[ETH通过官方跨链桥跨链-注册pinata并上传图片上链-复制CID后到wallet.zksync.io/account/nft](http://xn--eth-pinata-cidwallet-kk45aa705d6yqs1dme144covuzunvrsm4uo96c6osb88alk3bx31pba113pq4c8y8ecap.zksync.io/account/nft) 自己Mint NFT-zigzag换出usdc-注册并激活Argent钱包-参与Gitcoin捐赠（等下一期）-Orbiter跨链回主网或其他L2\n\n高级：主网上配合多签投票、质押（注意不能跨链）、ENS\n\nb.zkSync 2.0 (testnet）\n\n测试网的项目大概率不发币，但是可能会提高zks空投时赋予你的权重（multiplier)。这里可以看看水多多分享的zkSync项目集，自己挑一些心仪的项目做做，意思一下就好。\n\n👉作者推特：水多多|zkSync - Airtable \n 👉作者推特：水多多|zkSync - Airtable \n zkSync生态项目汇总 zkSync Project Collection \n [airtable.com](http://airtable.com/) \n 3.3.3 分币\n\n参与Snapshot投票只需要你有相应的代币或者质押的代币，本身是不花钱的，所以一定要多多参与，我们每个钱包都应该准备一些被看好的投票项目。\n\n使用bebop可以一币换多币，你可能需要一些aave、uni这样的代币，这是由wintermute打造的一个聚合DEX。\n\nbebop的缺点是gas略高，但是可以顺便博一下空投，值得试试。想要使用的话得加入discord申请白名单。\n\nJoin the Bebop Discord Server! \n Join the Bebop Discord Server! \n Make the most out of every exchange.

{"id": "7xjAca96CPmvsdeFv0g--GRxoK7WjteQ45_8MOnUmRE", "title": "ETH受到FOMO影响成交量持续放大 BTC进入常规周末行情 - 2022.7.17", "body": "### \n\n当前总结：其实周末和美国的假期中任何情况都是正常的，毕竟这个时候主力资金和主力抛压都不在，这也是为什么周末是最容易暴涨暴跌的时候，而且不论涨跌，只要幅度够大都会引发FOMO的情绪，只是相对于下跌来说，上涨更难一些。因为毕竟目前的宏观情况没有改变，所以在细节数据上也没有太大的变化。\n\n周末我们看到的即便是引发了极端行情也都是来自于情绪上的变化，更何况目前BTC和ETH的涨幅距离极端还很遥远，从总体数据上来看应该就是ETH利好的发酵，而引发这场上涨的成本却很少，如果放在工作日的话，也就是一点水花而已，情绪上的变化是否能延续还未尝可知。距离加息和GDP还有10天。\n\n还是那句话。任何方向的高杠杆都是致命的。目前ETH的上升通道是继续开启的，尤其是和BTC的汇率在高点时已经超过了0.066，已经回到BTC30,000美金时候的水平，之前考虑切换的小伙伴可以看看了，当然估计你们现在也舍不得切换了。而USDT的溢价在开始消失，这可能才是最大的利好。\n\n没有人能永远买在最低点，并且卖在最高点。愿意承担风险虽然都可以下场。害怕损失就保持多看少动，你看到的虽然是上涨的踏空，但你至少什么都没有失去。熊市不亏就是赚，这个道理理解不了熊市就熬不过去，在惨烈的行情都有反弹的时候，赌对一次赚不了太多，赌错一次…\n\nTwitter @Phyrex_Ni\n\n截止到今天中午12点40分的BTC持仓价格分布，因为昨天晚上特殊的原因所以没有来的急做图，今天的数据正好是近24小时的BTC链上地址的变化情况，从两边的极端价格来看，远古持仓的筹码变化稍微多一些，但依然在正常的范畴之内，这也说明了之前一直在强调的，获利筹码对于价格的变化会更加的敏感.\n\n毕竟当获利筹码越来越少的时候，煎熬最大的就是他们，卖掉还能保持一些收益，留着随时可能盈亏逆转，所以上涨和下跌都是对他们最大的煎熬，尤其是当宏观情况并不乐观的时候，卖是正常的，无非就是选择什么时候去卖。而相对于获利BTC来说，高位套牢的筹码相对就省心很多。\n\n目前的这种涨幅对于平均成本超过50,000万美金的高位套牢BTC来说几乎没有意义，放着等大趋势的回归或者是更高价格的反弹对他们可能才更有吸引力，所以看到高位套里的筹码在最近的24小时内才减持了不到300枚，可以说是标准的躺平了。22,000美金上方的整体亏损筹码的减持也进入周末的状态。\n\n同样并没有随着价格的上升而造成过多的变化，整体亏损BTC的离场才勉强到4,200枚，这还是24小时的数据，如果按照平时的一天两次统计，估计也就是2,000枚左右，可以看出对于当前这个价位的散户来说，19,000美金和22,000美金的价格没有什么太大的区别，亏的少的也不在意，亏的多的也没兴趣。\n\n很多小伙伴会说这帮人傻，为什么不趁高卖掉，等价格砸下来在抄底，不是能赚更多。但问题就在于这里，谁能保证价格的走势会按照你们提供的剧本来进行呢，对于经济派来说，目前就是底，对于通胀派来说，距离底还很差最少半年，这就是博弈，而有博弈就会有价格的波动。无非就是看那方面更有“钱”罢了。\n\n主要的抛压依然在当前的争端价格，但是从成交量也可以明显的看到，即便是有零手续费的加持，当前的成交量也就是这么回事，这也说明了当前的大环境并没有得到改善，周末的涨跌还仅仅是临时性的，只有周一下午的欧洲主力以及晚上的美国主力愿意为这个价格埋单，才能算是稳定下来。\n\n从当前转入交易所的BTC数据来看，日线上妥妥的进入了周末的行情，和上两周的同期数据对比，几乎没有变化，正常的不能在正常了。但是从昨天晚上21点到现在的细节数据来看，发现在今天上午10点出现了超过15,600枚BTC一次性的转移到了交易所。虽然暂时对价格没有产生变化是因为并没有着急抛售。\n\n而转出交易所的提现BTC在截止到今天早晨八点的数据中来看，虽然也算是正常，但是明显比上两周的同期数据要低，甚至是无法覆盖同期转入交易所的抛压，这就意味着更多的筹码已经驻留在交易所内。而细节数据上也没有发现对应新转入的15,600枚BTC，所以这部分的筹码也毫无疑问的就在交易所中等待时机。\n\n截止到今天早晨八点的BTC存量数据也可以清晰的看到，最近两天的存量都是处于上升的状态，这就是得益于上涨的价格，更多的筹码转移进交易所，随时做好了离场的准备。并且从截止到目前的细节数据来看，更加的不乐观，昨天到现在剩余存量以及新转入的筹码都推高了当前BTC在交易所的库存量，风险加大。\n\n相对于涨幅情况较少的BTC，最近两天的热门ETH则在情绪和周末的双双加持下走出了暂时的独立行情，从转入交易所的抛压可以看到，截止到今天早晨八点的抛压完全不像是周末的样子，几乎不逊于工作日的转移量进入到了交易所。而且从细节数据来看，虽然现在的转入量已经相对平稳，相比正常周末依然较多。\n\n但即便是已经被FOMO起来的ETH价格，截止到今天早晨八点从交易所转出提现的数据依然是少于了抛压，更多的ETH也是选择了滞留在交易所，而相对于依旧较高的抛压来说，目前的购买力差距依然很大，越来越多的ETH堆积在了交易所，在等待更好或更差的时机。\n\n从当前ETH的交易所存量也可以看到，截止到早晨八点的存量就是已经在提升了，而通过细节数据可以更加清晰的看到最近24小时来说，交易所的库存ETH是在持续上涨的，只有在下午13点30分之后才陆陆续续出现了减少的情况，总体来说，目前的抛压依然是较为强劲。\n\n从资金量来看，USDT目前还是进入了正常的周末情况，虽然相比前几个周日的资金量高出一些，但这几乎可以忽略不计了。而USDC确实有较为明显的较大幅度的转入交易所，但是从成交量上并没有特别的突出，即便是切换到细节数据也没有发现转变成了购买力。这些资金只是滞留在了交易所而已，并未下场。\n\n而从最近48小时的整体BTC和ETH的抛压以及USDT和USDC的转入购买力情况来看，资金量相对还是处于劣势，更多的还是要等下午15点以后开始是不是能有欧洲人的变化，如果没有能更多的资金入场，当前的抛压量可能会比较棘手。\n\n从当前BTC矿工筹码存量来看，最近一段时间价格都保持在20,000美金左右，而矿工的库存也并没有出现较大的减持，尤其是最近一周都维持在几乎是水平的移动，这也说明当前的价格下，矿工对于出售的兴趣并不算大。更多的BTC并没有离开矿工的钱包，尤其是中心化借贷的接连暴雷，放在自己钱包才是最安全的。", "timestamp": 1658041129, "digest": "s2yroWufS2ZExezHE2yPaTmKTFA2sLQ9cZwPdR9lIV0", "contributor": "0xdDa424d9bB3140bE68b0AAadCaf7CADf7c36A046"}

According to the above definition, Brendan Forster has sorted out the DeFi-type projects running on the ETH public chain. To date, Brendan Forster's definition of DeFi remains highly influential.\n\nEntering 2019, benefiting from the continuous improvement of the blockchain industry ecosystem, the industry has expanded the connotation and extension of DeFi: the movement to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols using open source software and decentralized networks. Accordingly, DeFi includes not only open source blockchain projects based on ETH networks serving the financial industry (or providing financial services), but also Bitcoin and Stellar, which issue passwords and use them for payment settlement.\n\nDeFi fever is gradually increasing\nThe blockchain may become the mother of new concepts such as \"DeFi\", but while Bitcoin was created only a decade ago, the term blockchain has to be updated. Just like the emergence of the Internet, many concepts and terms based on the Internet infrastructure or applications came out, the concept of \"blockchain\" will most likely become the mother of \"new concepts\" in this field in the near future. The concept of \"blockchain\" is likely to become the mother of \"new concepts\" in this field in the near future. It is not surprising that Decentralized Education, Decentralized Storage and Decentralized Communication will emerge in the future, just like Decentralized Finance. The financial industry is one of the most important applications of blockchain technology.\n\nThe financial industry is the key development direction of blockchain technology application, and more than one-third of blockchain projects can be categorized as DeFi. The blockchain projects directly serve the financial sector, including non-banking finance, wallets & trading, pass-through treasury, stable pass-through, banking services and payment settlement.\n\nDeFi\" has become more popular due to the outstanding market performance of the top projects in the DeFi category, and MakerDAO is currently the largest DeFi project in terms of market capitalization on the ETH network. According to CoinMarketcap, since January 2018, MakerDAO market capitalization ranking has steadily increased, from more than 40 to about 20, and since February 2019, the market capitalization has increased far more than the main circulation certificate, with excellent performance.\n\nBTC and the blockchain concept has been a decade of ups and downs, and so far, the market capitalization of the top 20 main liquidity certificates represented by BTC has long accounted for 88% -90% of the total market. -90% and have a relatively solid ranking. The blockchain projects represented by these pass-throughs are distributed in payment and settlement, operational platforms, banking services, wallets & transactions, stable pass-throughs and pass-through services. Based on the existing market pattern, innovation can not only avoid direct competition with these head projects, but also enjoy the native user deposits, which is a \"win-win\" option.\n\nWin-win cooperation is better than two strong rivalry\n\nFinance is the core of modern economy\nFinance refers to the circulation of value across time and space, and is the core of the modern economy. Finance in a narrow sense refers to the financing of monetary funds, and is centered on various forms of credit activities of banks and the circulation of money organized on the basis of credit. Finance in a broad sense is a three-dimensional system of vertical and horizontal, internal and external linkage, multi-dimensionality and multi-level, and is a huge system combined by a variety of elements but with mutual constraints and interactions.\n\nFinancial intermediation is the inevitable product of commodity economy and financial development. According to the People's Bank of China, the financial industry can be divided into four categories: monetary and financial services, capital market services, insurance industry, and other financial industries. The corresponding financial intermediaries can be divided into banks, securities companies, insurance companies trust companies, etc., which bear the needs of social and economic development in currency issuance, payment, financing, investment, information trading and risk trading, respectively. With the gradual formation of commodity economy, money and credit relations, financial intermediaries arose spontaneously. In the early days, financial institutions were mostly focused on the depository and exchange of money to meet the payment needs of the social economy. When the financing of funds became a high-frequency economic activity, both the supply and demand sides needed to be provided with financing services by specialized institutions, and the depository and lending financial intermediaries - banks came into being. With the development of the economy, on the one hand, there is a long-term demand for funds from the government and enterprises, and on the other hand, the accumulation of social money gradually increases and the demand for individual investment is stimulated. After the spread of credit relations, the variety of credit forms and the creation of joint-stock companies, the demand for investment and technical services related to bonds, stocks and other marketable securities emerged, thus giving rise to investment financial intermediation. The gradual expansion of the financial market and its increasing complexity and specialization led to the emergence of information-based financial intermediaries in order to reduce the cost of information gathering and improve the efficiency and accuracy of decision-making. Along with the social and economic progress, risk prevention awareness gradually sprouted and protection type financial intermediaries came into being.\n\nDeFi and Financial/Financial Intermediary: Complementary Strengths and Weaknesses\nDeFi and financial/financial intermediaries have their own advantages and can complement each other to a certain extent to achieve a \"win-win\" situation. Finance and financial intermediation have a long history, a deep social base and a wide coverage of people (based on credit and risk control).\n\nDeFi's non-discriminatory but conditional access has the potential to further expand the reach of finance. In terms of the current state of industry development, DeFi's access is more important than the threshold of user education, but DeFi's review of user assets (e.g., MakerDAO), i.e., the premise that users can actually enter and use DeFi only if they have a certain amount of pass-through assets. finance has evolved along with the development of human society and has a deep social foundation and a wide coverage of people. DeFi users based on pass-through assets may have a high overlap with credit-based financial users, but there are still theoretically DeFi users who are not yet covered by traditional finance.\n\nDeFi uses blockchain technology to improve transparency of transaction data, ensure irreversibility of transactions and a degree of censorship resistance. deFi has certain advantages in preventing malicious inflation by regime subjects. Blockchain technology has features such as open source code, irreversible transaction behavior, tamper-evident, publicly accessible transaction information and traceability of the subject of the transaction (pass-through). Compared with the traditional financial industry, the transparency of DeFi information is significantly improved. The mechanism of open source code and decentralized operation has certain advantages in preventing malicious inflation of regime subjects.\n\nIn terms of user reach, both DeFi and finance have the disadvantage of insufficient coverage. In addition, given the current state of industry development, DeFi also faces the disadvantages of technical risks and doubtful landing applications. Although traditional finance has been around for a long time and has penetrated all aspects of social life, there are still certain social groups that cannot enjoy financial services based on credit and risk control. DeFi's access to users based on pass-through assets has excluded most groups at this stage. Technical risks and landing applications are risks faced by the entire blockchain industry, and DeFi is inevitable.\n\nDeFi Prospects: A Hundred Boats Competing for Thousands of Sails\n\nThe number of DeFi-type projects is high, with ETH public chain as the main front\nSince the creation of the DeFi concept, there are currently thousands of eligible blockchain projects. According to Github, DeFi can be divided into decentralized exchange protocols, stable pass-throughs, loan protocols, derivative protocols/prediction markets, etc. According to the division criteria of the financial industry, DeFi can be reclassified into: monetary banking services (e.g. issuing stable pass-throughs), non-monetary banking services (e.g. loan agreements), financial services for the securities industry (e.g. categorized exchange agreements, derivative agreements/prediction markets, bundling agreements, fund agreements), other financial services not included (e.g. tokenization agreements, KYC/AML/identity, applications/tools, analytics, and others). What is clear is that at this stage DeFi is mostly focused on issuing pass-throughs, financing, trading and related financial instruments type areas.\n\nThe largest number of DeFi projects are deployed on the Ethereum public chain. On the one hand, Ethereum public chain is the first public chain to support smart contracts, making it the first choice of early DeFi developers. On the other hand, Brendan Forster, the creator of the DeFi concept, is the co-founder of Dharma Labs, which is also based on the Ethereum public chain, as well as MakerDAO, which is the most impressive performer.\n\nThe pioneer of \"pass-through banking\": MakerDAO\nBlockchain project MakerDAO has the function of issuing stable passwords and collateral financing, which has the initial shape of a \"passbook bank\" from the perspective of financial generation and historical process.\n\nMakerDAO can issue stable pass DAI, DAI by pass over collateral guarantee issue, and maintain a 1:1 anchor with the U.S. dollar, is by far the largest decentralized stable pass. MakerDAO based on ETH network operation, DAI is its internal stable pass, the issue of two ways: one is the user can use the Maker platform smart contract, by holding the The other is through the OTCMaker digital pass-through trading platform, using fiat currency to buy and sell DAIs.\n\nMakerDAO meets the financing needs of investors. In the traditional financial sector, banks and other financial intermediaries have strict restrictions on financing for SMEs and individuals due to risk control requirements. one of the ways to issue DAI is to create a CDP by pledging ETH. theoretically, as long as you have ETH, you can obtain a certain percentage of financing through MakerDAO to expand your earnings or hedge your risks. According to official data, as of the end of April 2019, more than 2.3 million ETH have been locked in Maker's smart contracts, and the total supply of DAIs reached $83.07 million.\n\nIn the current financial system, banks occupy an important link and may not only bear the heavy responsibility of issuing money based on national policies and economic operations (such as the Federal Reserve), but also have the function of participating in regulating the macro and micro economy, building a social credit system, and supervising the operation of the social economy. Compared with banks, the issuance mechanism of MakerDAO passwords has a single function, and its role in empowering the real society is doubtful, and MakerDAO is likely to expand its functional mechanism in the future.\n\nMakerDAO is subject to volatility risk and liquidity risk. In the MakerDAO system, one of the ways to generate DAI is to collateralize ETH passes. The current volatility of the pass market is high, with intra-day amplitudes of 10% not uncommon, so there is theoretically a situation where a significant drop in pass prices leads to insufficient collateral to cover the loan amount. Since MakerDAO currently only supports the pledge of ETH passes, and since 2019, the ETH locked in the MakerDAO system has increased significantly, from more than 2 million in March to 2.3 million in April, which will affect the market liquidity of ETH in the long run.\n\nDeFi: The Master of the \"Code World\nThe blockchain technology adopted by DeFi is traceable, tamper-proof and highly transparent, which is a useful supplement to the current financial industry. Later, as DeFi matures and blockchain technology iterates, DeFi will play a more important role and even dominate the future financial system of the \"code world\". However, in terms of the current state of the industry, social demand, public chain performance and user education are all \"roadblocks\" on the road to DeFi's development.\n\nWhether it is a real pain point or a pseudo-demand, we can't draw a definite conclusion yet. In the field of stable pass and pass trading, for example: in the field of stable pass, the recent fermentation of USDT event, the issuance of non-centralized stable pass will undoubtedly enhance investors' confidence; in the field of pass trading, such as non-centralized trading platform, it does not have the strength to challenge centralized pass trading platform in terms of user base and performance.\n\nThe performance of public chain is one of the bottlenecks in development. The majority of DeFi-type projects are currently developed based on a few public chains, and in terms of current technology iterations, most public chains do not support high TPS, which will undoubtedly limit the deployment of DeFi-type projects with high transaction rate requirements.\n\nUser education costs may be high. Modern banking has been around for over 300 years, and there are still large numbers of people who are not comfortable using it. Blockchain and BTC are only a decade old, and the rise of non-centralized stable pass-throughs and trading platforms is even later, so the time and cost of user education may be higher.\n\nAlthough there are problems mentioned above, the probability is that they are caused by the current state of development of the industry. At this stage, if DeFi is to grow significantly, it is a viable option to play a complementary role to finance in terms of content and form, rather than a replacement; DeFi's advantage of no access will help the financial industry to expand its service content and coverage, and diversify its service targets with lower trust costs. The application of blockchain technology in the financial sector will bring relative security, trust, efficiency, and to some extent, business model reorganization.", "timestamp": 1658042974, "digest": "i-gWYLF45ZP-Q8mBE2YhTggz2Yii6CI2azL_hqIWYP4", "contributor": "0x32409577208A528c8350CD8C79728e14eb153BFe"}

1 执行成功 ✅\n交易 2: a = a + 1, b = b - 1 执行失败 ❌\n交易 3: a = a + 1, b = b - 1 执行成功 ✅\n三次交易以后, 状态 a 等于 2，状态 b 等于 8\n```\n\n**交易 Transaction**\n\n交易 = 执行代码并改变状态，交易的形式确保执行权限和执行费用，一个交易包括：\n\n```\n from: 交易发起人\n   to: 交易对端\nvalue: from 发送给 to 的 ETH 数量\n data: 额外信息\n  gas: from 支付给矿工的燃气费\n```\n\n**一个转账交易的例子**\n\nX 给 Y 转 100 ETH，上面 a 和 b 的例子就是一个转账交易的状态变更过程：from 告诉矿工，把自己的余额减少 100 ETH，在把 to 的余额增加 100 ETH。\n\n```\n from: X\n   to: Y\nvalue: 100ETH\n data: 无\n  gas: 0.01ETH\n```\n\n执行的规程如下：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- X 的余额 -100ETH\n  |- Y 的余额 +100ETH\n```\n\n如果交易 Transaction 1 执行失败，交易内部产生的所有状态变更都不会被记录，所以不会出现 X 的余额减少但是 Y 的余额增加的情况。除非是这么操作：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- X 的余额 -100ETH\nTransaction 2\n  |- Y 的余额 +100ETH\n```\n\n交易 Transaction 2 会在 Transaction 1 执行以后再执行，不管 Transaction 1 执行的结果是什么，Transaction 2 都会修改 Y 的余额。转账操作一定要把转账双方余额变更的操作放在一个交易里执行。\n\n**一个合约执行的交易的例子**\n\nX 执行合约 C，在合约里把自己的名字改成 zhangsan\n\n```\n from: X\n   to: C\nvalue: 0\n data: rename(\"zhangsan\")\n  gas: 0.03ETH\n```\n\n地址 C 上面**部署着一个合约**，合约里**实现了 rename 方法**，接收一个字符串作为参数，交易执行过程：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- name = \"zhangsan\"\n```\n\n## 一个小问题，质押收益如何分配\n\n### 问题描述\n\n* 有一个资金池，会持续产生收入\n* 每产生一笔收入，就会按照当前池子里所有人的份额直接分配收益，人越多，每个人分配到的就越少\n* 所有人(Stakeholder)可以在池子里质押(Stake)某个特定代币证明自己的份额\n* 可以**随时追加或者减少自己的份额**，但是收益分配在收入产生的那个瞬间直接发生\n\n很多金融工具都需要这样的运行机制，比如比如活期存款利息，比如公司股权。\n\n### 举个例子\n\n以区块作为时间单位\n\n1. 区块1，A 和 B 分别质押 300 股和 100 股，A 占 75%，B 占 25%\n2. 区块2，进来一笔收益 $100，A 和 B 分别得到 $75 和 $25\n3. 区块3，B 追加 200 股，最终 A 和 B 各占 50%\n4. 区块4，进来一笔收益 $200，A 和 B 分别得到 $100 和 $100\n   * 最终，4个区块过后，A 和 B 的收益分别为 $175 和 $125\n\n### 要注意的是\n\n收益没法是积累到一定程度然后按照那时候的份额再分配，因为过程中所有人的份额都可以随时调整，合理的情况是质押时间越久，分享的收益就越多。比如上面的情况里，A 和 B 在 4 个区块后，最终的份额都是 50%，如果收益积累了 4 个区块再分配，那 A 和 B 就会各得 $150，显然 A 投资时间长，应该得到更多。\n\n### 简单的解决方案\n\n每次收益进来以后，根据比例，直接计算每个人的所得，然后直接转账分配收益。\n\n这个过程一般通过异步任务完成。但是以太坊上，写入数据（改变状态）的成本很高，也就是计算复杂度十分敏感，上面的做法，每一次分配的复杂度是 O(N)，其中 N 是质押者的数量，因为每次收益都要更新所有人的账本。随着质押者越来越多，交易成本也越来越高，这个在以太坊上难以接受。\n\n### 一种 O(1) 复杂度的更新算法\n\n大概的想法是这样，首先需要改变一下体验：\n\n* 可以在每次收益进来的时候更改某些变量就可以随时计算出质押者的总收益 O(1)\n* 质押者需要通过一个**提取**操作来最终获得收益，合约在每次提取的时候记录下 O(1)\n\n**算法如下**\n\n设\n\n```\nT 当前的总股数\nV 当前每一股可以获得的收益\nstake[X] 质押者 X 质押的数量\nsnapshot[X] 质押者 X 上一次操作时候的 V 值\n```\n\n步骤\n\n1\\. 区块1，A 和 B 分别质押 300 股和 100 股\n\n```\nT = 400, V = $0\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 100\nsnapshot[A] = snapshot[B] = 0\n```\n\n2\\. 区块2，进来一笔收益 $100\n\n```\nT = 400,V = $100 / 400 = $0.25\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 100\nsnapshot[A] = snapshot[B] = 0\n```\n\n3\\. 区块3，B 追加 200 股\n\n```\nB 自动提取收益 stake[B] * V = 100 * 0.25 =$25T = 600, V = $0.25\nstake[A] = 300,stake[B] = 300\nsnapshot[A] = 0,snapshot[B] = $0.25\n// 只需更新 B 自己的状态, V 不变, 因为 B 已经提取了截止当前的收益\n```\n\n4\\. 区块4，进来一笔收益 $200\n\n```\nT = 600,V = $0.25 + $200 / 600 = $0.5833         V = V' + revenue / T\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 300\nsnapshot[A] = 0, snapshot[B] = 0.25\n```\n\n5\\. 来看看双方剩余待提取的收益\n\n```\nA: stake[A] * V = 300 * $0.5833 =$175\nB: stake[B] *(V - snapshot[B]) = 300 * ($0.5833 - $0.25) = $100\n// B 已提取 $25, 还可以提取 $100, 应得总收益是 $125\n```\n\n### 其他类似的问题\n\n**固定速度收益（挖矿）**\n\n如果收益不是资金进来的时候产生，而是以一个固定的速度持续产生，比如每个区块产生 $1 收益。可以用前面类似的算法来实现，但是 V 是一个随着时间增长的变量。\n\n**存款利息（复利）**\n\n如果质押的不是“股”而是 $，也就是质押的资产和收益的资产是一样的，在固定速度收益的场景下，持续产生收益的过程中，质押的数量也会越来越大。用前面类似的算法可以算出复利所得。\n\n复利是天然简单的计息方式，但不直观。而单利是在特定时间窗口里折算出来的利息，更直观。\n\n如果资金池通过单利来控制收益，资金池就会有资金结余，作为储备金，通过单利调节需求。\n\n## 闪电贷实现\n\n### 合约代码\n\n```solidity\nfunction flashLoan(\n    address receiverAddress,    // 接收资产的地址\n    address asset,              // 资产名称\n    uint256 amount,             // 数量\n    bytes calldata params       // 自定义执行参数\n) {\n\n    // 1. 记录余额, 把指定数量的资产转给 receiverAddress\n    uint256 balance = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(this);\n    IERC20(asset).transferTo(receiverAddress, amount);\n\n    // 2. 执行自定义方法\n    IFlashLoanReceiver receiver = IFlashLoanReceiver(receiverAddress);\n    // receiver.executeOperation 里可以做任何事情, 但最后需要把 asset 转回来\nreceiver.executeOperation(params);\n\n    // 3. 检查 receiverAddress 是否在步骤 2 执行完以后归还资产并支付手续费 0.3%\n    require(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(this) >= balance * 1003 / 1000);\n\n    // 4. 如果上面的检查失败, 则 flashLoan 执行失败, 交易回滚（状态变更不会被记录）\n\n}\n```\n\n### 提供闪电贷的资金哪里来\n\n来自于 DeFi 项目\n\n1.

{"id": "7yEFjpVys2Wra0Pa6N0qeU0UoAqzG3vbQx2q-AiYUoc", "title": "通过闪电贷 FlashLoan 了解以太坊", "body": "## 闪电贷 FlashLoan\n\nFlashLoan 是一种无抵押借贷。任何人都可以随时从资金池中借出大量资产，用它在区块链上做任何交易，最后把连本带利还给资金池。整个过程需要在一个交易里完成。\n\n### 闪电贷攻击\n\n1. 2020年10月26日总锁仓量超过10亿美元的 DeFi 项目 Harvest Finance 曝出遭到黑客攻击，已造成大约2400万美元的损失。\n2. 2020年11月17日，起源协议 Origin Protocol 稳定币OUSD被爆出遭到闪电贷攻击，Origin Protocol共损失225万美元的 DAI 和100万美元的 ETH。\n3. 2021年5月12日，DeFi 质押和流动性策略平台 xToken 遭到攻击，xBNTa Bancor 池以及 xSNXa Balancer 池被耗尽，xToken 损失约2500万美元。\n4. 2021年 5 月 20 日，BSC 链上的 DeFi 收益聚合器 PancakeBunny 遭到闪电贷攻击。攻击者利用 PancakeSwap 操纵 LP Token（BNB-BUSDT/BNB-BUNNY）的价格，造成损失 4,500 多万美元。\n5. 2021 年 Cream Finance 多次遭受闪电贷攻击，2 月份损失 3750 万美元，8 月份损失 1900 万美元，10月份又损失约 1.3 亿美元。\n\n2022 还没结束，闪电贷攻击还在继续 ...\n\n### 闪电贷可以用来做什么\n\n市场永远存在大量的套利空间和漏洞，通过一次性借出大量的金额，可以\n\n1. 找到套利空间，进行大规模的低买高卖，获得**合理收益**；比如资产在交易所 A 的价格低于交易所 B 的价格 0.1%，大规模资金很容易套利。\n2. 将大量资金注入市场，操纵物价/币价，扰乱市场价格（预言机），利用**极端情况下**某些协议出现的漏洞，进行攻击。\n\n### 如何确保还钱？\n\n这个在以太坊上不是一个问题，因为以太坊是一个单实例的计算机，也是一个单实例的数据库，可以把任何操作放在同一个区块里进行原子操作。执行闪电贷的前提就是所有的交易需要在同一个区块里完成，这个由闪电贷提供者通过程序实现。\n\n### 直觉\n\n区块链给人最直观的感觉是去中心化的网络，特点是运行节点分散，并且数据永久。但是理解闪电贷的过程让人意识到，在 trustless 的场景下很多事情的做法不同。由于 trust 不需要任何成本，trust 本身是没有价值的，那么传统世界里本身基于 trust 发生的事情，在以太坊上面就会不一样。\n\n在以太坊上，默认信任第三方的假设是不存在的，并且可以随时回滚整个交易，所以默认不信任没关系，但自己要管理好自己的状态。在互联网上，如果没有默认信任第三方，就无法完成任何交互。\n\n## 以太坊运行\n\n### 合约执行的特点\n\n1. 状态更新需要合约执行，合约执行需要发起交易，矿工进行分布式记账，有人为之买单\n2. 交易是一系列操作的集合，交易成功以后，状态才会改变，交易失败不会改变任何状态\n3. 合约**不会并行执行**，交易串行执行，合约执行也是串行的，所有状态变更都有明确的先后顺序\n4. 合约**无法自动执行**，没有 0 成本的定时任务\n5. 合约**执行成本高**，全量更新等洗数据操作要通过优化过的数据结构来替代\n\n以太坊的状态，包括余额，都是**通过记账的方式进行维护**，一次记账就是一次状态变更记录，如果记账项目被删除，状态的变更也就会回退。举个例子：\n\n```\n初始状态 a = 0, b = 10\n交易 1: a = a + 1, b = b - 1 执行成功 ✅\n交易 2: a = a + 1, b = b - 1 执行失败 ❌\n交易 3: a = a + 1, b = b - 1 执行成功 ✅\n三次交易以后, 状态 a 等于 2，状态 b 等于 8\n```\n\n**交易 Transaction**\n\n交易 = 执行代码并改变状态，交易的形式确保执行权限和执行费用，一个交易包括：\n\n```\n from: 交易发起人\n   to: 交易对端\nvalue: from 发送给 to 的 ETH 数量\n data: 额外信息\n  gas: from 支付给矿工的燃气费\n```\n\n**一个转账交易的例子**\n\nX 给 Y 转 100 ETH，上面 a 和 b 的例子就是一个转账交易的状态变更过程：from 告诉矿工，把自己的余额减少 100 ETH，在把 to 的余额增加 100 ETH。\n\n```\n from: X\n   to: Y\nvalue: 100ETH\n data: 无\n  gas: 0.01ETH\n```\n\n执行的规程如下：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- X 的余额 -100ETH\n  |- Y 的余额 +100ETH\n```\n\n如果交易 Transaction 1 执行失败，交易内部产生的所有状态变更都不会被记录，所以不会出现 X 的余额减少但是 Y 的余额增加的情况。除非是这么操作：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- X 的余额 -100ETH\nTransaction 2\n  |- Y 的余额 +100ETH\n```\n\n交易 Transaction 2 会在 Transaction 1 执行以后再执行，不管 Transaction 1 执行的结果是什么，Transaction 2 都会修改 Y 的余额。转账操作一定要把转账双方余额变更的操作放在一个交易里执行。\n\n**一个合约执行的交易的例子**\n\nX 执行合约 C，在合约里把自己的名字改成 zhangsan\n\n```\n from: X\n   to: C\nvalue: 0\n data: rename(\"zhangsan\")\n  gas: 0.03ETH\n```\n\n地址 C 上面**部署着一个合约**，合约里**实现了 rename 方法**，接收一个字符串作为参数，交易执行过程：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- name = \"zhangsan\"\n```\n\n## 一个小问题，质押收益如何分配\n\n### 问题描述\n\n* 有一个资金池，会持续产生收入\n* 每产生一笔收入，就会按照当前池子里所有人的份额直接分配收益，人越多，每个人分配到的就越少\n* 所有人(Stakeholder)可以在池子里质押(Stake)某个特定代币证明自己的份额\n* 可以**随时追加或者减少自己的份额**，但是收益分配在收入产生的那个瞬间直接发生\n\n很多金融工具都需要这样的运行机制，比如比如活期存款利息，比如公司股权。\n\n### 举个例子\n\n以区块作为时间单位\n\n1. 区块1，A 和 B 分别质押 300 股和 100 股，A 占 75%，B 占 25%\n2. 区块2，进来一笔收益 $100，A 和 B 分别得到 $75 和 $25\n3. 区块3，B 追加 200 股，最终 A 和 B 各占 50%\n4. 区块4，进来一笔收益 $200，A 和 B 分别得到 $100 和 $100\n\n最终，4个区块过后，A 和 B 的收益分别为 $175 和 $125\n\n### 要注意的是\n\n收益没法是积累到一定程度然后按照那时候的份额再分配，因为过程中所有人的份额都可以随时调整，合理的情况是质押时间越久，分享的收益就越多。比如上面的情况里，A 和 B 在 4 个区块后，最终的份额都是 50%，如果收益积累了 4 个区块再分配，那 A 和 B 就会各得 $150，显然 A 投资时间长，应该得到更多。\n\n### 简单的解决方案\n\n每次收益进来以后，根据比例，直接计算每个人的所得，然后直接转账分配收益。\n\n这个过程一般通过异步任务完成。但是以太坊上，写入数据（改变状态）的成本很高，也就是计算复杂度十分敏感，上面的做法，每一次分配的复杂度是 O(N)，其中 N 是质押者的数量，因为每次收益都要更新所有人的账本。随着质押者越来越多，交易成本也越来越高，这个在以太坊上难以接受。\n\n### 一种 O(1) 复杂度的更新算法\n\n大概的想法是这样，首先需要改变一下体验：\n\n* 可以在每次收益进来的时候更改某些变量就可以随时计算出质押者的总收益 O(1)\n* 质押者需要通过一个**提取**操作来最终获得收益，合约在每次提取的时候记录下 O(1)\n\n**算法如下**\n\n设\n\n```\nT 当前的总股数\nV 当前每一股可以获得的收益\nstake[X] 质押者 X 质押的数量\nsnapshot[X] 质押者 X 上一次操作时候的 V 值\n```\n\n步骤\n\n1\\. 区块1，A 和 B 分别质押 300 股和 100 股\n\n```\nT = 400, V = $0\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 100\nsnapshot[A] = snapshot[B] = 0\n```\n\n2\\. 区块2，进来一笔收益 $100\n\n```\nT = 400,V = $100 / 400 = $0.25\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 100\nsnapshot[A] = snapshot[B] = 0\n```\n\n3\\. 区块3，B 追加 200 股\n\n```\nB 自动提取收益 stake[B] * V = 100 * 0.25 =$25T = 600, V = $0.25\nstake[A] = 300,stake[B] = 300\nsnapshot[A] = 0,snapshot[B] = $0.25\n// 只需更新 B 自己的状态, V 不变, 因为 B 已经提取了截止当前的收益\n```\n\n4\\. 区块4，进来一笔收益 $200\n\n```\nT = 600,V = $0.25 + $200 / 600 = $0.5833         V = V' + revenue / T\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 300\nsnapshot[A] = 0, snapshot[B] = 0.25\n```\n\n5\\. 来看看双方剩余待提取的收益\n\n```\nA: stake[A] * V = 300 * $0.5833 =$175\nB: stake[B] *(V - snapshot[B]) = 300 * ($0.5833 - $0.25) = $100\n// B 已提取 $25, 还可以提取 $100, 应得总收益是 $125\n```\n\n### 其他类似的问题\n\n**固定速度收益（挖矿）**\n\n如果收益不是资金进来的时候产生，而是以一个固定的速度持续产生，比如每个区块产生 $1 收益。可以用前面类似的算法来实现，但是 V 是一个随着时间增长的变量。\n\n**存款利息（复利）**\n\n如果质押的不是“股”而是 $，也就是质押的资产和收益的资产是一样的，在固定速度收益的场景下，持续产生收益的过程中，质押的数量也会越来越大。用前面类似的算法可以算出复利所得。\n\n复利是天然简单的计息方式，但不直观。而单利是在特定时间窗口里折算出来的利息，更直观。\n\n如果资金池通过单利来控制收益，资金池就会有资金结余，作为储备金，通过单利调节需求。\n\n## 闪电贷实现\n\n### 合约代码\n\n```solidity\nfunction flashLoan(\n    address receiverAddress,    // 接收资产的地址\n    address asset,              // 资产名称\n    uint256 amount,             // 数量\n    bytes calldata params       // 自定义执行参数\n) {\n\n    // 1. 记录余额, 把指定数量的资产转给 receiverAddress\n    uint256 balance = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(this);\n    IERC20(asset).transferTo(receiverAddress, amount);\n\n    // 2. 执行自定义方法\n    IFlashLoanReceiver receiver = IFlashLoanReceiver(receiverAddress);\n    // receiver.executeOperation 里可以做任何事情, 但最后需要把 asset 转回来\nreceiver.executeOperation(params);\n\n    // 3. 检查 receiverAddress 是否在步骤 2 执行完以后归还资产并支付手续费 0.3%\n    require(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(this) >= balance * 1003 / 1000);\n\n    // 4. 如果上面的检查失败, 则 flashLoan 执行失败, 交易回滚（状态变更不会被记录）\n\n}\n```\n\n### 提供闪电贷的资金哪里来\n\n来自于 DeFi 项目\n\n1. Decentralized Exchanges 去中心化交易所: Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.\n2. Lending Protocols 借贷协议: Aave, Compound, etc.\n3. Stablecoins 稳定币协议: MakerDAO\n\n不是所有 DeFi 项目都支持闪电贷，最早支持的项目是 **Aave**，后来还有其他链的 DeFi 项目比如 BSC 的 DODO 也添加了这个功能，比较早期或者规模较小的链上存在大量的套利空间，需求更多，同时闪电贷可以给 DeFi 项目带来手续费收益。\n\n## 去中心化交易所 DEX\n\n[交易所 DEX 原理 (Uniswap)](https://web3nomad.notion.site/DEX-Uniswap-36e1c9ba445d4f73b166f9163fe68d30)\n\n## 借贷协议\n\n[银行 Lending 原理 (Aave)](https://web3nomad.notion.site/Lending-Aave-33d7628ff78d4ca78368527968481dcd)\n\n## 稳定币\n\n未完待续", "timestamp": 1658043415, "digest": "8susN-D4rICs2HWqwO55C6auSH8S10OGjbl6gz-9O0E", "contributor": "0x4a3e40B76a946495a6255B521240487e71f73d2C"}

A brutal sensual frankness and a disarming sense of sarcasm in my work underline our inhibitions and fears, forcing the spectator to face them, and demonstrating how life must and need to extend beyond these imposed stereotypes.\n\nThe same call for freedom can be found in some of my political work, where I addressed topics such as feminism, the annexation of Crimea, or the latest conflicts in Afghanistan. Another recurring theme of mine is the representation of hands, which are without a doubt both a universal and personal metaphor for freedom and a tool that can represent who we are because of what we decide to use them for. A faceless portrait of our humanity.\n\nAlthough having a predilection for classical print, I work with different techniques to represent the individual narrative of each subject, and I find that digital media allows me more immediacy. This grants me to capture the instant that I want to portray, creating a recognizable style between all of my works, which are characterized by quick and unaltered raw lines.\n\n[https://linktr.ee/Moustachesauvage](https://linktr.ee/Moustachesauvage)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658044144, "digest": "MTG_q6fQDLqzdlBYGhs9ZgxkShmJnIE2LHTJSn2-C5s", "contributor": "0x18D1573a89C9a7CfE14ae77A9B150ad9D57B9AfC"}

Web2 meets Web3, expanding the realm of possibility and reality. Project FILO has always been about Web3 before it was even a thing.**\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/](https://www.projectfilo.com/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/ProjectFilo](https://twitter.com/ProjectFilo)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/project.filo/](https://www.instagram.com/project.filo/)\n\nEver since our conception, Project FILO hasn’t been a definable thing. It’s always been an ecosystem that grows around the artist. By artists and for artists. It may seem simple, but in the startup world and within web2, it often limits the imagination beyond the status quo. Allow us to reintroduce ourselves.\n\n## Who is Project FILO?\n\nWe are a global creative ecosystem that is by artists, for artists focused on creating, curating, and cross-collaboration to help artists exceed the vision of their future selves. Founded by siblings Brandon Washington and Lauren Washington, Project FILO represents expression -  the tenacity to be multi-dimensional and undeniably boundless. When you think of originators within innovation and progression, they can not be boxed in. If you ask what Project FILO is, the answer will evolve and adapt each time, but what remains is that we are built by artists & for artists. Project FILO is a global ecosystem and hub focusing on creation, curation, and collaboration for excluded & emerging artists. We’re innovating on new modes of tools, curation, and collaborations for a new framework of strategy and accessibility within creative industries. FILO specializes in management, development, curation, and consulting for a wide net of creatives with a strong commitment to inclusivity. There is no bridge that cannot be built. Our network encompasses multidisciplinary creations, management, event series, a publication, platforms, and like-minded partners. It is difficult to process a vision counterintuitive to the grain because for so long the standard has been industries that are gate kept, inaccessible, and non-inclusive. PF is built by artists for artists within creative industries ranging from film, visual arts, design, fashion, and music. All art is interconnected and thrives better when you listen to artists first and foremost. The present and future belong to giving power back to the creators. PF facilitates a new creative ecosystem that builds on itself as we grow.\n\nFILO stands for First In, Last Out. The acronym \"FILO\" was inspired by the legends Nujabes & Shing02's song entitled \"F.I.L.O.\" off the album Metaphorical Music. [Producer Shing02 even told one of our artists (MZA) that “the concept of being ‘first in’ and ‘last out’ is not only a phrase, but a motto that we should strive to apply to work, family, friends, and of course ourselves.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BztPJ20FEO-/) By doing so, we can not only reshape the creative space for good but improve the world one mighty step at a time. When you think of originators of innovation and progression, it can not be boxed in.\n\nAlong with Project FILO, we’ve been building Project FILO Selects which is an eventual platform x protocol for creation, curation, & collaboration to support any artist. All artists deserve an opportunity and this is the infrastructure for artist support at any point in their journey. Pre- web3, we experimented with [PFS](https://www.instagram.com/pfselects/) by building out the culture and community of artists who align with our ethos and want to be seen. Giving others a spotlight or co-sign can be the catalyst for change and manifest in numerous ways, so there’s never an excuse for exclusivity. MC Blue Matter is spearheading the creative direction with Brandon on A&R scouting and relationship building, as well as Lauren overseeing partnerships + brand strategy. With web3, we will further build out an intentional incubation ecosystem our community deserves with cross DAO collaboration, an incubator of curation, our [Zoetic x PF educational series](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w), Selectships, and a new platform x protocol launch for all artists with comprehensive tools all in one place for creation, curation, and collaboration.\n\nOur mission for Selects DAO Q1 mission revolves around a common goal of ideating on app integration and creative tooling. Since 2020, we’ve been building on an idea for a platform by artists, for artists that champions our ethos with a focus on creation, curation, and collaboration. Artists deserve tools that reflect the interconnectedness of all art forms and that focus attention on one designated portal. Artists are the heartbeat of culture, society, and the future but the hyper-financialization of society makes being an artist a race towards a small entryway of what success looks like aka an industry standard. We will build a protocol for artists that provides the tools all in one place for creating, curating, and collaborating. To do this, we want to align with our ethos by inviting partners to fully build this out properly with all the iterations we’ve been dreaming of. In this, we will pitch to prospective targets and seek out referrals to build the core team. The goal is for this to become a DAO and will be PF’s first pivot into web3. The platform for collective governance forever dedicated to artists’ needs and tooling for creation, curation, and collaboration. Partnerships are a key piece to the foundation, just like the rise of DAO2DAO collaborations. Project FILO’s mission is not to compete with other game-changing brands, but to promote and potentially work with them. Our team firmly holds the belief that effective disruption of gatekept models requires a variability of solutions and routine collaboration with the best of the very best participants. That is why we plan to team up with like-minded communities and our network to build Selects as a DAO.\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight)\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight-pt-2](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight-pt-2)\n\n### Our core team functions as :\n\n**A CREATIVE HUB**\n11 musicians\n5+ filmmakers\n2 fashion designers\n4 visual artists\n\n**MANAGEMENT + A&R TEAM**\n\n**PODCASTING**\n\n**SELF - SERVING PUBLICATION/PR**\n\n**EVENTS**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS + SPONSORSHIPS**\n\n**ALUMNI NETWORK**\n\n***In order to understand how we got here, let us narrate the beginning…***\n\n### How Project FILO began?\n\nIn 2014, Project FILO was called N.A.G.E (New Age Golden Era) and led by Brandon Washington, who was a middle schooler at the time, and M1Darton. Inspired by his budding love of underground hip-hop and Soundcloud, Brandon became an A&R assembling a team of musicians across the globe to form a music collective.\n\n“N.A.G.E. is both an independent music label, and advocate of artistically inclined individuals creating masterpieces.”\n\n[https://official-nage.wixsite.com/nage](https://official-nage.wixsite.com/nage)\n\nN.A.G.E’s roster consisted of Entendre (now known as Cordae), MZA, M1Dartin, Benjo, Finesse, The Deli, Raff Alpha, $keleton, LaVon, gawdlee, Bryson McGee, Jon Bartley, Namuuna, Saib, Nymano, Sean RosatiTHIAGO, anigma, and Rival. Once in high school, Brandon shifted focus to pursuing soccer professionally and N.A.G.E. members all grew in their own new directions. Brandon remained tight with N.A.G.E members, notably Marc and Raff. Fast forward to 2017, Brandon wasn't content with the way things ended. Upon discovery that MZA was still making music, it took just one direct message through Soundcloud to convince him of joining the second attempt at N.A.G.E aka Project FILO. MZA and Brandon share the exact same age and birthday (March 7, 1998), just a fun fact. So in 2017, Project FILO became a reality with MZA, Brandon, and Lauren as co-founders. Lauren stepped in once realizing her own immense passion with storytelling in high school and both siblings decided to expand beyond just music. FILO Music, FILO Films, FILO Visual Art, FILO Journalists, FILO Managers. Since then, MZA has stepped down from the co-founder role to being an artist and is still a vocal member of the team. At Project FILO, we have always prioritized transparency with our team, so we believe founders to be fluid and look forward to exploring more in web3 with our founding inner team that includes everyone in PF.\n\n### The Journey of Project FILO\n\nA lot of the journey has exist​​ed in phases corresponding to our journey as founders, as brother and sister, and life cycles. 2017-2018 was pivotal in the rebuilding phase of culture, community, and experimentation. It’s crucial to let your idea breathe and not shy away from the discomfort of needing to pivot. A lot of today’s culture is about who can be first and the quickest instead of intentionality and sustainability which will really cultivate culture. Although not directly always working on Project FILO, our journeys in our respective fields of inter​​sets were crucial to the long-term and short-term development of what we’ve been building.\n\n​​The next phase of Project FILO began as both Brandon and myself discovered more of our passions as artists & creative entrepreneurs. What makes anything run well is people and if you can’t identify how to work together, then how will your venture coexist in the long run and how will you cultivate culture? Brandon and I being brother and sister naturally already has been a cheat code. We both have been building out our own networks and experimenting which has only informed us more of the vision for Project FILO. It’s fitting as PF is a growing creative ecosystem.\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/brandonwashington](https://www.projectfilo.com/brandonwashington)\n\n[https://laurenmwash.com/](https://laurenmwash.com/)\n\nIt takes time to develop that culture and that’s what the past four years have been for us. We make it a point to be transparent with every step of the mission and that builds trust. Our entire PF team grows together and it is one of the best feelings to be at this point seeing everything coming into fruition. In 2020, Project FILO was accepted into Northwestern’s Wildfire accelerator program.\n\n[https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/news/wildfire-2020-virtual-demo-day-pitches/](https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/news/wildfire-2020-virtual-demo-day-pitches/)\n\nThat journey was the next phase of our career and while we didn’t win, the real prize was our pivot for the future and aligning with our mentor, Doug Lambert.\n\n[https://twitter.com/laurenmwash/status/1302016218635829249?s=20&t=9A_FtMqtMGNbzgXhtNMmYg](https://twitter.com/laurenmwash/status/1302016218635829249?s=20&t=9A_FtMqtMGNbzgXhtNMmYg)\n\nMost of startup culture has always been about what can make the most $, so it is no surprise something that goes against the grain won’t entice traditional investors. After the summer of 2020, we were overjoyed to still be working alongside our mentor and now also advisory board member, Doug Lambert. Afterwards, the vision was never more clear. We worked alongside Mr. Lambert to construct our pitch deck for a true platform by artists & for artists and simultaneously, co-founder Lauren made her way into web3 in fall/winter of 2021. Lauren spent a lot of time on Clubhouse and stumbled upon Jodi Anderson from CreateSafe. All three of us began talking and it was extremely clear our ethos was aligned with being by artists & for artists. Partners are crucial to our mission and it should be encouraged especially in the artist economy so we can establish long-lasting collaborative ecosystems that don’t rely on gatekeeping, exclusivity, or inaccessibility. We had a series of meetings and developed a synthesis of where to first start our aligned efforts together. As a network with multidisciplinary artists, our first output collectively was with FILO Mixes and through CreateSafe, we’ve been able to carry that onward with a new beneficial system.\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes](https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes)\n\nHuge appreciation to CreateSafe and all of their efforts as they have made the pivot into web3 as well with @createdao. Without realizing it, this journey was the next stone Project FILO needed to awaken everything we’ve been dreaming up and putting into motion the past few years. Co-founder Lauren has done the due diligence for us to take the next step with her success as an artist in this space, undergoing a @fwbtweets fellowship, and DAO experimentation with @V01D_DAO, @protein, @herstorydao, @radarxyz, & Maxiverse. The next step of the journey is cultivating more of our existing community with new interested parties and building an intentional entry into web3 by building our platform plus producing more original PF work. **More on that will be shared in-depth soon but a recap of some of the highlights we’ve produced in the meantime:**\n\n**-[Lyrical Lemonade](https://www.projectfilo.com/press) accolades**\n\n**-[Project FILO Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/UndergroundTunnel47)**\n\n**-[Project FILO Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectfilo)**\n\n**-[Wildfire 2020](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/11/11/ae/northwestern-startup-project-filo-aims-to-redefine-media-industry/)**\n\n**-[CreateSafe mixes](https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes)**\n\n**-[Flows For Days](https://flowsfordays.com/2018/05/24/multi-media-platform-filo-drops-2nd-hip-hop-mix/)** \n\n**-[Founder Stories](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/founders-stories-made-by-mza-marc-millers-mark)** \n\n**-[Audiomack challenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Ev8bcl1xS/)**\n\n**-[Merch drop](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVDrl7TrKG_/)**\n\n**-[PF Selects](https://www.instagram.com/pfselects/)**\n\n**-[Real Ones Podcast](https://linktr.ee/realonespod)**\n\n**-[Zoetics x Real Ones x PF “Navigating Creative Industry series”](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w)**\n\n**-[Juicebox Collective #FRESHPRESSED](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w)**\n\n### Stay tuned for:\n\n* Selects DAO - the platform and protocol for creation, curation, and collaboration.\n* Navigating the creative industry series\n* Wavelength - a creative lifestyle & duo w/ Lauren + Jordan\n  * Podcast, fashion, film, collaborative multimedia\n* Real One's episodes\n* New website\n* Re-introduction of Project FILO team via Mirror & Zora - Artist profiles x nft’s\n* Partnerships\n* PF events\n* Merch Fall capsule designed by Gabe x Jordan\n* FILO Mix 5\n* PF pfp collection\n* PF x Coinvise\n\n**If you’re interested in working together, investing, sponsoring, or any other general inquiries please contact us via our website, socials, or emails at filobrandon11@gmail.com + laurenlomedia@gmail.com.**", "timestamp": 1658043602, "digest": "svtuWvO8nsA1j3GBPCL83msp7VU34JZEaVF84XO19kc", "contributor": "0x813b9B79Ad45eE466DF3a2b3ED31c47aC3B281AA"}

But **Mirror** is quickly changing that. In this guide, we’re going to dive into **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** - **a web3 toolkit for sharing stories, funding ideas, and turning text-based content into NFTs** - and publish an entry on Mirror of our own!\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we begin, let’s make sure you have your gear in order. To mint an entry on Mirror, all you’ll need is an Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow.\n\n*If you need help getting set up, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w).** There, you’ll find a guide for **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)!***\n\n## NFTs & Mirror\n\nWhile today’s most popular NFTs are image-based, pictures are just a fraction of what NFTs are capable of. At their core, **NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are simply proofs of ownership written on a blockchain**. These proofs of ownership represent an asset, digital or physical, and link it to an individual's blockchain address. The result is a publicly verifiable file, showing a certain thing owned by a certain person.\n\nSo, can an article be an NFT? Absolutely!\n\nAt first glance, **Mirror** may just look like a web3 platform for publishing and monetizing articles — something like a blockchain-based Medium or Substack. But under the hood, Mirror is a powerful tool for creating content and building communities. It gives you everything you need for minting NFTs, crowdfunding, splitting proceeds from sales, and even minting ERC20 tokens to distribute to new community members.\n\n**Today, we’re going to write our first Mirror articles and publish them as NFTs. Let’s go!**\n\n## The Guide\n\n### Step 1\n\nFirst, head to **[mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/)** and **connect your wallet** with the button in the top-right corner.\n\n### Step 2\n\nIf this is your first time using Mirror, **go to the Settings tab** in the left toolbar to set your profile picture, bio, color theme, and display name.\n\n### Step 3\n\nOnce you're happy with your profile settings, go back to the **Entries** tab and **click *Create Your First Entry***.\n\n### Step 4\n\nNow on the Write page, you’ll have access to Mirror’s text editor. This includes all of the writing platform essentials - headings, bulleted lists, images, and blockquotes. **Go ahead and write your article!** If you’re stumped and looking for inspiration, hop into the **[RabbitHole community Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz)** for ideas to get your started!\n\nYou will also have access to a number of web3 tools for monetizing your work and incorporating other NFTs. These include Crowdfund, Edition, Auction, Split, and NFT Preview. We won’t be using these for our first entry, but you can learn more about them **[here](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide)**!\n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter you have written your article, **click the gear in the top-right corner** **to bring up your article settings.** Upload a **header image** (3000x1500 px) and enter a **meta title** and **entry excerpt**. Your header image will also represent your Writing NFT when it is minted.\n\nOnce you're done, check your meta preview at the bottom of the article settings. This will show you how your article will appear on Mirror, search engines, and social media platforms. This is also a good time to **save your article as a draft** if you haven’t done so already. Just **click *Save Draft*** at the top.\n\n### Step 6\n\nNow that you have a written article, a header image, and your meta settings all filled out, it’s time to **give everything a good double-check**. As with any NFT you mint, this article will forever be associated with your wallet! Even if you sell it, your wallet address will be shown as the original creator. So be sure to mint an original, quality article that you are happy to be associated with.\n\n### Step 7\n\nIf everything looks good to go, it’s time to publish! Click *Publish* and **toggle on the NFT checkbox.**\n\n### Step 8\n\nTo publish your article, you will be prompted to **switch to Optimism**, an Ethereum L2 network. This makes Writing NFTs free to create, cheap to collect, and gives your articles visibility across multiple Mirror pages like the Collection page and Leaderboard.\n\nIf you haven’t already added Optimism to your MetaMask, open your MetaMask and **click on the network dropdown**.\n\n**Click *Add Network*** at the bottom of the list. You’ll be brought to this form:\n\nEnter the following network details into their respective fields:\n\n* Network name: Optimism\n* New RPC URL: [https://mainnet.optimism.io](https://mainnet.optimism.io/)\n* Chain Id: 10\n* Currency Symbol: ETH\n* Block Explorer URL: [https://optimistic.etherscan.io](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/)\n\n**Click *Save*** and you’ll be automatically connected to Optimism!\n\nTo avoid adding Optimism manually to your wallet, you can also search for the network through [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/).\n\n### Step 9\n\nHere comes the really important part: **setting the price and supply of your Writing NFT.**\n\nMirror recommends setting an accessible price (<0.01 ETH, currently <$20 USD) and a sizable supply (>100 units) so that many people will be able to collect your Writing NFT. You can read more [here](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/mint-writing-nfts).\n\nIt’s important that you think this one through. After publishing your entry you’ll be able to edit its content but not the price and supply values that you’ve set.\n\nOnce you’ve given it some good thought, **confirm the values and click *Publish*.**\n\n## Congratulations!\n\n**And that’s it!** This transaction will take a few minutes to confirm, but once you’ve signed it, the NFT will exist on arweave until someone collects it. At that point, it becomes an ERC721 NFT on Optimism.\n\nTo view your Writing NFT, head over to an Optimism-based NFT marketplace like [Quixotic](https://quixotic.io/). Again, keep in mind that the NFT will not show up in the marketplace or on anyone’s wallet until at least one of your Writing NFTs have been collected.\n\nPublishing on Mirror is just one part of our NFT journey this season.

{"id": "Smrldj04mbhRflw9knEJsXRB6jZep3IyA3a0sdRGvak", "title": "PROJECT FILO: WHO ARE WE?", "body": "**Welcome to the evolution of Project FILO. Web2 meets Web3, expanding the realm of possibility and reality. Project FILO has always been about Web3 before it was even a thing.**\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/](https://www.projectfilo.com/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/ProjectFilo](https://twitter.com/ProjectFilo)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/project.filo/](https://www.instagram.com/project.filo/)\n\nEver since our conception, Project FILO hasn’t been a definable thing. It’s always been an ecosystem that grows around the artist. By artists and for artists. It may seem simple, but in the startup world and within web2, it often limits the imagination beyond the status quo. Allow us to reintroduce ourselves.\n\n## Who is Project FILO?\n\nWe are a global creative ecosystem that is by artists, for artists focused on creating, curating, and cross-collaboration to help artists exceed the vision of their future selves. Founded by siblings Brandon Washington and Lauren Washington, Project FILO represents expression -  the tenacity to be multi-dimensional and undeniably boundless. When you think of originators within innovation and progression, they can not be boxed in. If you ask what Project FILO is, the answer will evolve and adapt each time, but what remains is that we are built by artists & for artists. Project FILO is a global ecosystem and hub focusing on creation, curation, and collaboration for excluded & emerging artists. We’re innovating on new modes of tools, curation, and collaborations for a new framework of strategy and accessibility within creative industries. FILO specializes in management, development, curation, and consulting for a wide net of creatives with a strong commitment to inclusivity. There is no bridge that cannot be built. Our network encompasses multidisciplinary creations, management, event series, a publication, platforms, and like-minded partners. It is difficult to process a vision counterintuitive to the grain because for so long the standard has been industries that are gate kept, inaccessible, and non-inclusive. PF is built by artists for artists within creative industries ranging from film, visual arts, design, fashion, and music. All art is interconnected and thrives better when you listen to artists first and foremost. The present and future belong to giving power back to the creators. PF facilitates a new creative ecosystem that builds on itself as we grow.\n\nFILO stands for First In, Last Out. The acronym \"FILO\" was inspired by the legends Nujabes & Shing02's song entitled \"F.I.L.O.\" off the album Metaphorical Music. [Producer Shing02 even told one of our artists (MZA) that “the concept of being ‘first in’ and ‘last out’ is not only a phrase, but a motto that we should strive to apply to work, family, friends, and of course ourselves.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BztPJ20FEO-/) By doing so, we can not only reshape the creative space for good but improve the world one mighty step at a time. When you think of originators of innovation and progression, it can not be boxed in.\n\nAlong with Project FILO, we’ve been building Project FILO Selects which is an eventual platform x protocol for creation, curation, & collaboration to support any artist. All artists deserve an opportunity and this is the infrastructure for artist support at any point in their journey. Pre- web3, we experimented with [PFS](https://www.instagram.com/pfselects/) by building out the culture and community of artists who align with our ethos and want to be seen. Giving others a spotlight or co-sign can be the catalyst for change and manifest in numerous ways, so there’s never an excuse for exclusivity. MC Blue Matter is spearheading the creative direction with Brandon on A&R scouting and relationship building, as well as Lauren overseeing partnerships + brand strategy. With web3, we will further build out an intentional incubation ecosystem our community deserves with cross DAO collaboration, an incubator of curation, our [Zoetic x PF educational series](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w), Selectships, and a new platform x protocol launch for all artists with comprehensive tools all in one place for creation, curation, and collaboration.\n\nOur mission for Selects DAO Q1 mission revolves around a common goal of ideating on app integration and creative tooling. Since 2020, we’ve been building on an idea for a platform by artists, for artists that champions our ethos with a focus on creation, curation, and collaboration. Artists deserve tools that reflect the interconnectedness of all art forms and that focus attention on one designated portal. Artists are the heartbeat of culture, society, and the future but the hyper-financialization of society makes being an artist a race towards a small entryway of what success looks like aka an industry standard. We will build a protocol for artists that provides the tools all in one place for creating, curating, and collaborating. To do this, we want to align with our ethos by inviting partners to fully build this out properly with all the iterations we’ve been dreaming of. In this, we will pitch to prospective targets and seek out referrals to build the core team. The goal is for this to become a DAO and will be PF’s first pivot into web3. The platform for collective governance forever dedicated to artists’ needs and tooling for creation, curation, and collaboration. Partnerships are a key piece to the foundation, just like the rise of DAO2DAO collaborations. Project FILO’s mission is not to compete with other game-changing brands, but to promote and potentially work with them. Our team firmly holds the belief that effective disruption of gatekept models requires a variability of solutions and routine collaboration with the best of the very best participants. That is why we plan to team up with like-minded communities and our network to build Selects as a DAO.\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight)\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight-pt-2](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight-pt-2)\n\n### Our core team functions as :\n\n**A CREATIVE HUB**\n11 musicians\n5+ filmmakers\n2 fashion designers\n4 visual artists\n\n**MANAGEMENT + A&R TEAM**\n\n**PODCASTING**\n\n**SELF - SERVING PUBLICATION/PR**\n\n**EVENTS**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS + SPONSORSHIPS**\n\n**ALUMNI NETWORK**\n\n***In order to understand how we got here, let us narrate the beginning…***\n\n### How Project FILO began?\n\nIn 2014, Project FILO was called N.A.G.E (New Age Golden Era) and led by Brandon Washington, who was a middle schooler at the time, and M1Darton. Inspired by his budding love of underground hip-hop and Soundcloud, Brandon became an A&R assembling a team of musicians across the globe to form a music collective.\n\n“N.A.G.E. is both an independent music label, and advocate of artistically inclined individuals creating masterpieces.”\n\n[https://official-nage.wixsite.com/nage](https://official-nage.wixsite.com/nage)\n\nN.A.G.E’s roster consisted of Entendre (now known as Cordae), MZA, M1Dartin, Benjo, Finesse, The Deli, Raff Alpha, $keleton, LaVon, gawdlee, Bryson McGee, Jon Bartley, Namuuna, Saib, Nymano, Sean RosatiTHIAGO, anigma, and Rival. Once in high school, Brandon shifted focus to pursuing soccer professionally and N.A.G.E. members all grew in their own new directions. Brandon remained tight with N.A.G.E members, notably Marc and Raff. Fast forward to 2017, Brandon wasn't content with the way things ended. Upon discovery that MZA was still making music, it took just one direct message through Soundcloud to convince him of joining the second attempt at N.A.G.E aka Project FILO. MZA and Brandon share the exact same age and birthday (March 7, 1998), just a fun fact. So in 2017, Project FILO became a reality with MZA, Brandon, and Lauren as co-founders. Lauren stepped in once realizing her own immense passion with storytelling in high school and both siblings decided to expand beyond just music. FILO Music, FILO Films, FILO Visual Art, FILO Journalists, FILO Managers. Since then, MZA has stepped down from the co-founder role to being an artist and is still a vocal member of the team. At Project FILO, we have always prioritized transparency with our team, so we believe founders to be fluid and look forward to exploring more in web3 with our founding inner team that includes everyone in PF.\n\n### The Journey of Project FILO\n\nA lot of the journey has exist​​ed in phases corresponding to our journey as founders, as brother and sister, and life cycles. 2017-2018 was pivotal in the rebuilding phase of culture, community, and experimentation. It’s crucial to let your idea breathe and not shy away from the discomfort of needing to pivot. A lot of today’s culture is about who can be first and the quickest instead of intentionality and sustainability which will really cultivate culture. Although not directly always working on Project FILO, our journeys in our respective fields of inter​​sets were crucial to the long-term and short-term development of what we’ve been building.\n\n​​The next phase of Project FILO began as both Brandon and myself discovered more of our passions as artists & creative entrepreneurs. What makes anything run well is people and if you can’t identify how to work together, then how will your venture coexist in the long run and how will you cultivate culture? Brandon and I being brother and sister naturally already has been a cheat code. We both have been building out our own networks and experimenting which has only informed us more of the vision for Project FILO. It’s fitting as PF is a growing creative ecosystem.\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/brandonwashington](https://www.projectfilo.com/brandonwashington)\n\n[https://laurenmwash.com/](https://laurenmwash.com/)\n\nIt takes time to develop that culture and that’s what the past four years have been for us. We make it a point to be transparent with every step of the mission and that builds trust. Our entire PF team grows together and it is one of the best feelings to be at this point seeing everything coming into fruition. In 2020, Project FILO was accepted into Northwestern’s Wildfire accelerator program.\n\n[https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/news/wildfire-2020-virtual-demo-day-pitches/](https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/news/wildfire-2020-virtual-demo-day-pitches/)\n\nThat journey was the next phase of our career and while we didn’t win, the real prize was our pivot for the future and aligning with our mentor, Doug Lambert.\n\n[https://twitter.com/laurenmwash/status/1302016218635829249?s=20&t=9A_FtMqtMGNbzgXhtNMmYg](https://twitter.com/laurenmwash/status/1302016218635829249?s=20&t=9A_FtMqtMGNbzgXhtNMmYg)\n\nMost of startup culture has always been about what can make the most $, so it is no surprise something that goes against the grain won’t entice traditional investors. After the summer of 2020, we were overjoyed to still be working alongside our mentor and now also advisory board member, Doug Lambert. Afterwards, the vision was never more clear. We worked alongside Mr. Lambert to construct our pitch deck for a true platform by artists & for artists and simultaneously, co-founder Lauren made her way into web3 in fall/winter of 2021. Lauren spent a lot of time on Clubhouse and stumbled upon Jodi Anderson from CreateSafe. All three of us began talking and it was extremely clear our ethos was aligned with being by artists & for artists. Partners are crucial to our mission and it should be encouraged especially in the artist economy so we can establish long-lasting collaborative ecosystems that don’t rely on gatekeeping, exclusivity, or inaccessibility. We had a series of meetings and developed a synthesis of where to first start our aligned efforts together. As a network with multidisciplinary artists, our first output collectively was with FILO Mixes and through CreateSafe, we’ve been able to carry that onward with a new beneficial system.\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes](https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes)\n\nHuge appreciation to CreateSafe and all of their efforts as they have made the pivot into web3 as well with @createdao. Without realizing it, this journey was the next stone Project FILO needed to awaken everything we’ve been dreaming up and putting into motion the past few years. Co-founder Lauren has done the due diligence for us to take the next step with her success as an artist in this space, undergoing a @fwbtweets fellowship, and DAO experimentation with @V01D_DAO, @protein, @herstorydao, @radarxyz, & Maxiverse. The next step of the journey is cultivating more of our existing community with new interested parties and building an intentional entry into web3 by building our platform plus producing more original PF work. **More on that will be shared in-depth soon but a recap of some of the highlights we’ve produced in the meantime:**\n\n**-[Lyrical Lemonade](https://www.projectfilo.com/press) accolades**\n\n**-[Project FILO Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/UndergroundTunnel47)**\n\n**-[Project FILO Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectfilo)**\n\n**-[Wildfire 2020](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/11/11/ae/northwestern-startup-project-filo-aims-to-redefine-media-industry/)**\n\n**-[CreateSafe mixes](https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes)**\n\n**-[Flows For Days](https://flowsfordays.com/2018/05/24/multi-media-platform-filo-drops-2nd-hip-hop-mix/)** \n\n**-[Founder Stories](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/founders-stories-made-by-mza-marc-millers-mark)** \n\n**-[Audiomack challenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Ev8bcl1xS/)**\n\n**-[Merch drop](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVDrl7TrKG_/)**\n\n**-[PF Selects](https://www.instagram.com/pfselects/)**\n\n**-[Real Ones Podcast](https://linktr.ee/realonespod)**\n\n**-[Zoetics x Real Ones x PF “Navigating Creative Industry series”](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w)**\n\n**-[Juicebox Collective #FRESHPRESSED](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w)**\n\n### Stay tuned for:\n\n* Selects DAO - the platform and protocol for creation, curation, and collaboration.\n* Navigating the creative industry series\n* Wavelength - a creative lifestyle & duo w/ Lauren + Jordan\n  * Podcast, fashion, film, collaborative multimedia\n* Real One's episodes\n* New website\n* Re-introduction of Project FILO team via Mirror & Zora - Artist profiles x nft’s\n* Partnerships\n* PF events\n* Merch Fall capsule designed by Gabe x Jordan\n* FILO Mix 5\n* PF pfp collection\n* PF x Coinvise", "timestamp": 1658043496, "digest": "YqOjDQzqxBgwPXwX6yql68-ygyd93KP2zll6MSbJuAg", "contributor": "0x813b9B79Ad45eE466DF3a2b3ED31c47aC3B281AA"}

{"id": "wKqbQNKhzLjNnulwV5aEs1diA6uS9o08LJDDKyY7GMA", "title": "通过闪电贷 FlashLoan 了解以太坊", "body": "## 闪电贷 FlashLoan\n\nFlashLoan 是一种无抵押借贷。任何人都可以随时从资金池中借出大量资产，用它在区块链上做任何交易，最后把连本带利还给资金池。整个过程需要在一个交易里完成。\n\n### 闪电贷攻击\n\n1. 2020年10月26日总锁仓量超过10亿美元的 DeFi 项目 Harvest Finance 曝出遭到黑客攻击，已造成大约2400万美元的损失。\n2. 2020年11月17日，起源协议 Origin Protocol 稳定币OUSD被爆出遭到闪电贷攻击，Origin Protocol共损失225万美元的 DAI 和100万美元的 ETH。\n3. 2021年5月12日，DeFi 质押和流动性策略平台 xToken 遭到攻击，xBNTa Bancor 池以及 xSNXa Balancer 池被耗尽，xToken 损失约2500万美元。\n4. 2021年 5 月 20 日，BSC 链上的 DeFi 收益聚合器 PancakeBunny 遭到闪电贷攻击。攻击者利用 PancakeSwap 操纵 LP Token（BNB-BUSDT/BNB-BUNNY）的价格，造成损失 4,500 多万美元。\n5. 2021 年 Cream Finance 多次遭受闪电贷攻击，2 月份损失 3750 万美元，8 月份损失 1900 万美元，10月份又损失约 1.3 亿美元。\n\n2022 还没结束，闪电贷攻击还在继续 ...\n\n### 闪电贷可以用来做什么\n\n市场永远存在大量的套利空间和漏洞，通过一次性借出大量的金额，可以\n\n1. 找到套利空间，进行大规模的低买高卖，获得**合理收益**；比如资产在交易所 A 的价格低于交易所 B 的价格 0.1%，大规模资金很容易套利。\n2. 将大量资金注入市场，操纵物价/币价，扰乱市场价格（预言机），利用**极端情况下**某些协议出现的漏洞，进行攻击。\n\n### 如何确保还钱？\n\n这个在以太坊上不是一个问题，因为以太坊是一个单实例的计算机，也是一个单实例的数据库，可以把任何操作放在同一个区块里进行原子操作。执行闪电贷的前提就是所有的交易需要在同一个区块里完成，这个由闪电贷提供者通过程序实现。\n\n### 直觉\n\n区块链给人最直观的感觉是去中心化的网络，特点是运行节点分散，并且数据永久。但是理解闪电贷的过程让人意识到，在 trustless 的场景下很多事情的做法不同。由于 trust 不需要任何成本，trust 本身是没有价值的，那么传统世界里本身基于 trust 发生的事情，在以太坊上面就会不一样。\n\n在以太坊上，默认信任第三方的假设是不存在的，并且可以随时回滚整个交易，所以默认不信任没关系，但自己要管理好自己的状态。在互联网上，如果没有默认信任第三方，就无法完成任何交互。\n\n## 以太坊运行\n\n### 合约执行的特点\n\n1. 状态更新需要合约执行，合约执行需要发起交易，矿工进行分布式记账，有人为之买单\n2. 交易是一系列操作的集合，交易成功以后，状态才会改变，交易失败不会改变任何状态\n3. 合约**不会并行执行**，交易串行执行，合约执行也是串行的，所有状态变更都有明确的先后顺序\n4. 合约**无法自动执行**，没有 0 成本的定时任务\n5. 合约**执行成本高**，全量更新等洗数据操作要通过优化过的数据结构来替代\n\n以太坊的状态，包括余额，都是**通过记账的方式进行维护**，一次记账就是一次状态变更记录，如果记账项目被删除，状态的变更也就会回退。举个例子：\n\n```\n初始状态 a = 0, b = 10\n交易 1: a = a + 1, b = b - 1 执行成功 ✅\n交易 2: a = a + 1, b = b - 1 执行失败 ❌\n交易 3: a = a + 1, b = b - 1 执行成功 ✅\n三次交易以后, 状态 a 等于 2，状态 b 等于 8\n```\n\n**交易 Transaction**\n\n交易 = 执行代码并改变状态，交易的形式确保执行权限和执行费用，一个交易包括：\n\n```\n from: 交易发起人\n   to: 交易对端\nvalue: from 发送给 to 的 ETH 数量\n data: 额外信息\n  gas: from 支付给矿工的燃气费\n```\n\n**一个转账交易的例子**\n\nX 给 Y 转 100 ETH，上面 a 和 b 的例子就是一个转账交易的状态变更过程：from 告诉矿工，把自己的余额减少 100 ETH，在把 to 的余额增加 100 ETH。\n\n```\n from: X\n   to: Y\nvalue: 100ETH\n data: 无\n  gas: 0.01ETH\n```\n\n执行的规程如下：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- X 的余额 -100ETH\n  |- Y 的余额 +100ETH\n```\n\n如果交易 Transaction 1 执行失败，交易内部产生的所有状态变更都不会被记录，所以不会出现 X 的余额减少但是 Y 的余额增加的情况。除非是这么操作：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- X 的余额 -100ETH\nTransaction 2\n  |- Y 的余额 +100ETH\n```\n\n交易 Transaction 2 会在 Transaction 1 执行以后再执行，不管 Transaction 1 执行的结果是什么，Transaction 2 都会修改 Y 的余额。转账操作一定要把转账双方余额变更的操作放在一个交易里执行。\n\n**一个合约执行的交易的例子**\n\nX 执行合约 C，在合约里把自己的名字改成 zhangsan\n\n```\n from: X\n   to: C\nvalue: 0\n data: rename(\"zhangsan\")\n  gas: 0.03ETH\n```\n\n地址 C 上面**部署着一个合约**，合约里**实现了 rename 方法**，接收一个字符串作为参数，交易执行过程：\n\n```\nTransaction 1\n  |- name = \"zhangsan\"\n```\n\n## 一个小问题，质押收益如何分配\n\n### 问题描述\n\n* 有一个资金池，会持续产生收入\n* 每产生一笔收入，就会按照当前池子里所有人的份额直接分配收益，人越多，每个人分配到的就越少\n* 所有人(Stakeholder)可以在池子里质押(Stake)某个特定代币证明自己的份额\n* 可以**随时追加或者减少自己的份额**，但是收益分配在收入产生的那个瞬间直接发生\n\n很多金融工具都需要这样的运行机制，比如比如活期存款利息，比如公司股权。\n\n### 举个例子\n\n以区块作为时间单位\n\n1. 区块1，A 和 B 分别质押 300 股和 100 股，A 占 75%，B 占 25%\n2. 区块2，进来一笔收益 $100，A 和 B 分别得到 $75 和 $25\n3. 区块3，B 追加 200 股，最终 A 和 B 各占 50%\n4. 区块4，进来一笔收益 $200，A 和 B 分别得到 $100 和 $100\n   * 最终，4个区块过后，A 和 B 的收益分别为 $175 和 $125\n\n### 要注意的是\n\n收益没法是积累到一定程度然后按照那时候的份额再分配，因为过程中所有人的份额都可以随时调整，合理的情况是质押时间越久，分享的收益就越多。比如上面的情况里，A 和 B 在 4 个区块后，最终的份额都是 50%，如果收益积累了 4 个区块再分配，那 A 和 B 就会各得 $150，显然 A 投资时间长，应该得到更多。\n\n### 简单的解决方案\n\n每次收益进来以后，根据比例，直接计算每个人的所得，然后直接转账分配收益。\n\n这个过程一般通过异步任务完成。但是以太坊上，写入数据（改变状态）的成本很高，也就是计算复杂度十分敏感，上面的做法，每一次分配的复杂度是 O(N)，其中 N 是质押者的数量，因为每次收益都要更新所有人的账本。随着质押者越来越多，交易成本也越来越高，这个在以太坊上难以接受。\n\n### 一种 O(1) 复杂度的更新算法\n\n大概的想法是这样，首先需要改变一下体验：\n\n* 可以在每次收益进来的时候更改某些变量就可以随时计算出质押者的总收益 O(1)\n* 质押者需要通过一个**提取**操作来最终获得收益，合约在每次提取的时候记录下 O(1)\n\n**算法如下**\n\n设\n\n```\nT 当前的总股数\nV 当前每一股可以获得的收益\nstake[X] 质押者 X 质押的数量\nsnapshot[X] 质押者 X 上一次操作时候的 V 值\n```\n\n步骤\n\n1\\. 区块1，A 和 B 分别质押 300 股和 100 股\n\n```\nT = 400, V = $0\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 100\nsnapshot[A] = snapshot[B] = 0\n```\n\n2\\. 区块2，进来一笔收益 $100\n\n```\nT = 400,V = $100 / 400 = $0.25\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 100\nsnapshot[A] = snapshot[B] = 0\n```\n\n3\\. 区块3，B 追加 200 股\n\n```\nB 自动提取收益 stake[B] * V = 100 * 0.25 =$25T = 600, V = $0.25\nstake[A] = 300,stake[B] = 300\nsnapshot[A] = 0,snapshot[B] = $0.25\n// 只需更新 B 自己的状态, V 不变, 因为 B 已经提取了截止当前的收益\n```\n\n4\\. 区块4，进来一笔收益 $200\n\n```\nT = 600,V = $0.25 + $200 / 600 = $0.5833         V = V' + revenue / T\nstake[A] = 300, stake[B] = 300\nsnapshot[A] = 0, snapshot[B] = 0.25\n```\n\n5\\. 来看看双方剩余待提取的收益\n\n```\nA: stake[A] * V = 300 * $0.5833 =$175\nB: stake[B] *(V - snapshot[B]) = 300 * ($0.5833 - $0.25) = $100\n// B 已提取 $25, 还可以提取 $100, 应得总收益是 $125\n```\n\n### 其他类似的问题\n\n**固定速度收益（挖矿）**\n\n如果收益不是资金进来的时候产生，而是以一个固定的速度持续产生，比如每个区块产生 $1 收益。可以用前面类似的算法来实现，但是 V 是一个随着时间增长的变量。\n\n**存款利息（复利）**\n\n如果质押的不是“股”而是 $，也就是质押的资产和收益的资产是一样的，在固定速度收益的场景下，持续产生收益的过程中，质押的数量也会越来越大。用前面类似的算法可以算出复利所得。\n\n复利是天然简单的计息方式，但不直观。而单利是在特定时间窗口里折算出来的利息，更直观。\n\n如果资金池通过单利来控制收益，资金池就会有资金结余，作为储备金，通过单利调节需求。\n\n## 闪电贷实现\n\n### 合约代码\n\n```solidity\nfunction flashLoan(\n    address receiverAddress,    // 接收资产的地址\n    address asset,              // 资产名称\n    uint256 amount,             // 数量\n    bytes calldata params       // 自定义执行参数\n) {\n\n    // 1. 记录余额, 把指定数量的资产转给 receiverAddress\n    uint256 balance = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(this);\n    IERC20(asset).transferTo(receiverAddress, amount);\n\n    // 2. 执行自定义方法\n    IFlashLoanReceiver receiver = IFlashLoanReceiver(receiverAddress);\n    // receiver.executeOperation 里可以做任何事情, 但最后需要把 asset 转回来\nreceiver.executeOperation(params);\n\n    // 3. 检查 receiverAddress 是否在步骤 2 执行完以后归还资产并支付手续费 0.3%\n    require(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(this) >= balance * 1003 / 1000);\n\n    // 4. 如果上面的检查失败, 则 flashLoan 执行失败, 交易回滚（状态变更不会被记录）\n\n}\n```\n\n### 提供闪电贷的资金哪里来\n\n来自于 DeFi 项目\n\n1. Decentralized Exchanges 去中心化交易所: Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.\n2. Lending Protocols 借贷协议: Aave, Compound, etc.\n3. Stablecoins 稳定币协议: MakerDAO\n\n不是所有 DeFi 项目都支持闪电贷，最早支持的项目是 **Aave**，后来还有其他链的 DeFi 项目比如 BSC 的 DODO 也添加了这个功能，比较早期或者规模较小的链上存在大量的套利空间，需求更多，同时闪电贷可以给 DeFi 项目带来手续费收益。\n\n## 去中心化交易所 DEX\n\n[交易所 DEX 原理 (Uniswap)](https://web3nomad.notion.site/DEX-Uniswap-36e1c9ba445d4f73b166f9163fe68d30)\n\n## 借贷协议\n\n[银行 Lending 原理 (Aave)](https://web3nomad.notion.site/Lending-Aave-33d7628ff78d4ca78368527968481dcd)\n\n## 稳定币\n\n未完待续", "timestamp": 1658043348, "digest": "DGFH3RegBaIiTTe5viKe-HsxAV4uSXIc-77PO2HcXsk", "contributor": "0x4a3e40B76a946495a6255B521240487e71f73d2C"}

We’re innovating on new modes of tools, curation, and collaborations for a new framework of strategy and accessibility within creative industries. FILO specializes in management, development, curation, and consulting for a wide net of creatives with a strong commitment to inclusivity. There is no bridge that cannot be built. Our network encompasses multidisciplinary creations, management, event series, a publication, platforms, and like-minded partners. It is difficult to process a vision counterintuitive to the grain because for so long the standard has been industries that are gate kept, inaccessible, and non-inclusive. PF is built by artists for artists within creative industries ranging from film, visual arts, design, fashion, and music. All art is interconnected and thrives better when you listen to artists first and foremost. The present and future belong to giving power back to the creators. PF facilitates a new creative ecosystem that builds on itself as we grow.\n\nFILO stands for First In, Last Out. The acronym \"FILO\" was inspired by the legends Nujabes & Shing02's song entitled \"F.I.L.O.\" off the album Metaphorical Music. [Producer Shing02 even told one of our artists (MZA) that “the concept of being ‘first in’ and ‘last out’ is not only a phrase, but a motto that we should strive to apply to work, family, friends, and of course ourselves.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BztPJ20FEO-/) By doing so, we can not only reshape the creative space for good but improve the world one mighty step at a time. When you think of originators of innovation and progression, it can not be boxed in.\n\nAlong with Project FILO, we’ve been building Project FILO Selects which is an eventual platform x protocol for creation, curation, & collaboration to support any artist. All artists deserve an opportunity and this is the infrastructure for artist support at any point in their journey. Pre- web3, we experimented with [PFS](https://www.instagram.com/pfselects/) by building out the culture and community of artists who align with our ethos and want to be seen. Giving others a spotlight or co-sign can be the catalyst for change and manifest in numerous ways, so there’s never an excuse for exclusivity. MC Blue Matter is spearheading the creative direction with Brandon on A&R scouting and relationship building, as well as Lauren overseeing partnerships + brand strategy. With web3, we will further build out an intentional incubation ecosystem our community deserves with cross DAO collaboration, an incubator of curation, our [Zoetic x PF educational series](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w), Selectships, and a new platform x protocol launch for all artists with comprehensive tools all in one place for creation, curation, and collaboration. \n\nOur mission for Selects DAO Q1 mission revolves around a common goal of ideating on app integration and creative tooling. Since 2020, we’ve been building on an idea for a platform by artists, for artists that champions our ethos with a focus on creation, curation, and collaboration. Artists deserve tools that reflect the interconnectedness of all art forms and that focus attention on one designated portal. Artists are the heartbeat of culture, society, and the future but the hyper-financialization of society makes being an artist a race towards a small entryway of what success looks like aka an industry standard. We will build a protocol for artists that provides the tools all in one place for creating, curating, and collaborating. To do this, we want to align with our ethos by inviting partners to fully build this out properly with all the iterations we’ve been dreaming of. In this, we will pitch to prospective targets and seek out referrals to build the core team. The goal is for this to become a DAO and will be PF’s first pivot into web3. The platform for collective governance forever dedicated to artists’ needs and tooling for creation, curation, and collaboration. Partnerships are a key piece to the foundation, just like the rise of DAO2DAO collaborations. Project FILO’s mission is not to compete with other game-changing brands, but to promote and potentially work with them. Our team firmly holds the belief that effective disruption of gatekept models requires a variability of solutions and routine collaboration with the best of the very best participants. That is why we plan to team up with like-minded communities and our network to build Selects as a DAO. \n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight)\n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight-pt-2](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/project-filo-presents-creative-brands-spotlight-pt-2)\n\n### Our core team functions as :\n\n**A CREATIVE HUB**\n11 musicians\n5+ filmmakers\n2 fashion designers\n4 visual artists\n\n**MANAGEMENT + A&R TEAM**\n\n**PODCASTING**\n\n**SELF - SERVING PUBLICATION/PR**\n\n**EVENTS**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS + SPONSORSHIPS**\n\n**ALUMNI NETWORK**\n\n***In order to understand how we got here, let us narrate the beginning…***\n\n### How Project FILO began?\n\nIn 2014, Project FILO was called N.A.G.E (New Age Golden Era) and led by Brandon Washington, who was a middle schooler at the time, and M1Darton. Inspired by his budding love of underground hip-hop and Soundcloud, Brandon became an A&R assembling a team of musicians across the globe to form a music collective.\n\n“N.A.G.E. is both an independent music label, and advocate of artistically inclined individuals creating masterpieces.”\n\n[https://official-nage.wixsite.com/nage](https://official-nage.wixsite.com/nage)\n\nN.A.G.E’s roster consisted of Entendre (now known as Cordae), MZA, M1Dartin, Benjo, Finesse, The Deli, Raff Alpha, $keleton, LaVon, gawdlee, Bryson McGee, Jon Bartley, Namuuna, Saib, Nymano, Sean RosatiTHIAGO, anigma, and Rival. Once in high school, Brandon shifted focus to pursuing soccer professionally and N.A.G.E. members all grew in their own new directions. Brandon remained tight with N.A.G.E members, notably Marc and Raff. Fast forward to 2017, Brandon wasn't content with the way things ended. Upon discovery that MZA was still making music, it took just one direct message through Soundcloud to convince him of joining the second attempt at N.A.G.E aka Project FILO. MZA and Brandon share the exact same age and birthday (March 7, 1998), just a fun fact. So in 2017, Project FILO became a reality with MZA, Brandon, and Lauren as co-founders. Lauren stepped in once realizing her own immense passion with storytelling in high school and both siblings decided to expand beyond just music. FILO Music, FILO Films, FILO Visual Art, FILO Journalists, FILO Managers. Since then, MZA has stepped down from the co-founder role to being an artist and is still a vocal member of the team. At Project FILO, we have always prioritized transparency with our team, so we believe founders to be fluid and look forward to exploring more in web3 with our founding inner team that includes everyone in PF.\n\n### The Journey of Project FILO\n\nA lot of the journey has exist​​ed in phases corresponding to our journey as founders, as brother and sister, and life cycles. 2017-2018 was pivotal in the rebuilding phase of culture, community, and experimentation. It’s crucial to let your idea breathe and not shy away from the discomfort of needing to pivot. A lot of today’s culture is about who can be first and the quickest instead of intentionality and sustainability which will really cultivate culture. Although not directly always working on Project FILO, our journeys in our respective fields of inter​​sets were crucial to the long-term and short-term development of what we’ve been building.\n\n​​The next phase of Project FILO began as both Brandon and myself discovered more of our passions as artists & creative entrepreneurs. What makes anything run well is people and if you can’t identify how to work together, then how will your venture coexist in the long run and how will you cultivate culture? Brandon and I being brother and sister naturally already has been a cheat code. We both have been building out our own networks and experimenting which has only informed us more of the vision for Project FILO. It’s fitting as PF is a growing creative ecosystem. \n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/brandonwashington](https://www.projectfilo.com/brandonwashington)\n\n[https://laurenmwash.com/](https://laurenmwash.com/)\n\nIt takes time to develop that culture and that’s what the past four years have been for us. We make it a point to be transparent with every step of the mission and that builds trust. Our entire PF team grows together and it is one of the best feelings to be at this point seeing everything coming into fruition. In 2020, Project FILO was accepted into Northwestern’s Wildfire accelerator program.\n\n[https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/news/wildfire-2020-virtual-demo-day-pitches/](https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/news/wildfire-2020-virtual-demo-day-pitches/)\n\nThat journey was the next phase of our career and while we didn’t win, the real prize was our pivot for the future and aligning with our mentor, Doug Lambert.\n\n[https://twitter.com/laurenmwash/status/1302016218635829249?s=20&t=9A_FtMqtMGNbzgXhtNMmYg](https://twitter.com/laurenmwash/status/1302016218635829249?s=20&t=9A_FtMqtMGNbzgXhtNMmYg)\n\nMost of startup culture has always been about what can make the most $, so it is no surprise something that goes against the grain won’t entice traditional investors. After the summer of 2020, we were overjoyed to still be working alongside our mentor and now also advisory board member, Doug Lambert. Afterwards, the vision was never more clear. We worked alongside Mr. Lambert to construct our pitch deck for a true platform by artists & for artists and simultaneously, co-founder Lauren made her way into web3 in fall/winter of 2021. Lauren spent a lot of time on Clubhouse and stumbled upon Jodi Anderson from CreateSafe. All three of us began talking and it was extremely clear our ethos was aligned with being by artists & for artists. Partners are crucial to our mission and it should be encouraged especially in the artist economy so we can establish long-lasting collaborative ecosystems that don’t rely on gatekeeping, exclusivity, or inaccessibility. We had a series of meetings and developed a synthesis of where to first start our aligned efforts together. As a network with multidisciplinary artists, our first output collectively was with FILO Mixes and through CreateSafe, we’ve been able to carry that onward with a new beneficial system. \n\n[https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes](https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes)\n\nHuge appreciation to CreateSafe and all of their efforts as they have made the pivot into web3 as well with @createdao. Without realizing it, this journey was the next stone Project FILO needed to awaken everything we’ve been dreaming up and putting into motion the past few years. Co-founder Lauren has done the due diligence for us to take the next step with her success as an artist in this space, undergoing a @fwbtweets fellowship, and DAO experimentation with @V01D_DAO, @protein, @herstorydao, @radarxyz, & Maxiverse. The next step of the journey is cultivating more of our existing community with new interested parties and building an intentional entry into web3 by building our platform plus producing more original PF work. **More on that will be shared in-depth soon but a recap of some of the highlights we’ve produced in the meantime:**\n\n\\-[Lyrical Lemonade ](https://www.projectfilo.com/press)accolades\n\n\\-[Project FILO Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/UndergroundTunnel47)\n\n\\-[Project FILO Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectfilo)\n\n\\-[Wildfire 2020](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/11/11/ae/northwestern-startup-project-filo-aims-to-redefine-media-industry/)\n\n\\-[CreateSafe mixes](https://www.projectfilo.com/mixes)\n\n\\-[Flows For Days ](https://flowsfordays.com/2018/05/24/multi-media-platform-filo-drops-2nd-hip-hop-mix/)\n\n\\-[Founder Stories ](https://www.projectfilo.com/blog/founders-stories-made-by-mza-marc-millers-mark)\n\n\\-[Audiomack challenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Ev8bcl1xS/)\n\n\\-[Merch drop](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVDrl7TrKG_/)\n\n\\-[PF Selects](https://www.instagram.com/pfselects/)\n\n\\-[Zoetics x Real Ones x PF “Navigating Creative Industry series”](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w)\n\n\\-[Juicebox Collective #FRESHPRESSED](https://twitter.com/projectfilo/status/1511138150516670467?s=12&t=ObUTScBZcFK8imhrfHz57w)\n\n### Stay tuned for:\n\n* Selects DAO - the platform and protocol for creation, curation, and collaboration.\n* Navigating the creative industry series \n* Wavelength - a creative lifestyle & duo w/ Lauren + Jordan\n  * Podcast, fashion, film, collaborative multimedia\n* Real One's episodes \n* New website \n* Re-introduction of Project FILO team via Mirror & Zora - Artist profiles x nft’s\n* Partnerships \n* PF events \n* Merch Fall capsule designed by Gabe x Jordan\n* FILO Mix 5\n* PF pfp collection\n* PF x Coinvise", "timestamp": 1658043257, "digest": "rtmPRO2deg6iirZlQbye5FitikyAfNjEA8hJKjjOTyM", "contributor": "0x813b9B79Ad45eE466DF3a2b3ED31c47aC3B281AA"}

Like how GameFi went so popular in 2021, and people say it’s because of the pandemic and lockdown in South East Asia, people get a higher income than their regular job, by staying at home and playing Axie, that’s why Axie went trending and the heat of GameFi was spread around the world. **The core here is “Earn”, not “X”, X is only a type of PoW mechanism, people spend time, physical/mental energy, etc. to do work, and get rewarded for it.**\n\nBreakthrough in software and hardware, more companies are adapting to remote working, result to drop in the cost of living, lead to a decrease in demand for physical goods in real life, and people are now spending increasingly more time online. **Reduce of in-person contact, means I won’t see the new Lamborghini you just bought, and you won’t see the new LV I just bought, more disposable income will be spent online and in Web3, people switched from flexing offline to online.**\n\n**Leaps in technology lead to leaps in society, everything can be monetised in the future.** Let’s not limit our imagination, by aggregating the technology of multi-chain, cross-chain, VR, AR, etc. we could possibly see a worldwide X to Earn happening someday, and the term “X to Earn” is likely to be rephrased to another term like gig economy.\n\nThere will be different varieties of tasks and events for users to participate, the activities people do on daily basis can be quantified and rewarded or punished. Tokenisation will be blended into our life, gaming, dog walking, social, creation, even tree planting etc. can all get rewarded or punished in various degrees, does it sounds like a scene that can only be seen in *Black Mirror*? Now the question is, when these changes happen, will you embrace the changes that the new world brings, or will you be forced to accept them only when they become mainstream?\n\n**There will be 3 types of narratives for the future X to Earn:**\n\n* X = Self-Improvement\n* X = Daily Life\n* X = Entertainment\n\n### X = Self-Improvement\n\nOne sentence to sum up this type of X to Earn: **use raga, dvesha, and moha, to beat raga, dvesha, and moha.**\n\n*Note: Raga, dvesha, and moha are called three poisons which is similar to the seven deadly sins in Christian teachings.*\n\nThese are the nature of a human, and they can’t be changed.\n\nThe most representative one currently would be STEPN for Move to Earn, the characteristics for this type of X to Earn is: **your “mining” activities are the activities that you wanted to do and you supposed to do, but because of laziness and not having enough inventive, you don’t have the power of will to do so. And these “mining” activities can bring you actual benefits in the long term, not only on the financial aspect.**\n\nMany people try to explain the whole STEPN move to earn mechanism as it was a gym membership, how you bet against the gym, but in fact, we are looking at two different things here.\n\n**What you are buying for the gym membership is a product and service in a subscription form, that’s all.** After the subscription period, you will have no relation with the gym anymore, and the gym itself does not provide you with any incentives other than why you are paying for the gym. With the “bet-on theory” people are saying gyms make money when you don’t show up in the gym cause of occupation of the gym’s resources and vice versa, which is not entirely correct, this is not the business model for gyms. The core model for the gym is you pay for things that you don’t need, like a whole year of membership which you only show up for a few times.\n\n**What you are buying for the Move to Earn NFT is an asset that incentivises you.** Or you can say you bought a derivative (NFT) from the project, and the project supervises you on your work, when you have done enough work, then the project will give your money back, like a bond. So you never betting against gym or project, you are betting against yourself, betting on if you can keep doing the work that you were too lazy to do until you make your money back. This is why this type of X to Earn is so fascinating, you are not only getting short-term financial incentives but long-term benefits and values for yourself.\n\n**99.9% of the users went for money at the beginning, but gradually experiencing self-improvement and discover new stuff in the middle of money-chasing process.** In the new world, physical type of X to Earn, like running, riding, training, etc., will be more popular than mental type of X to Earn, because you can really feel the change of your body in short to mid term, thus, can accumulate more true believer easily and fast. On the other hand, the mental type of self-improvement X to Earn will take a long period of time to see the effect, and users can’t feel the improvement as intuitive as the physical type.\n\nRegardless of study, fitness, yoga, etc. we are going to see the born of a few more killer apps for this self-improvement type of X to Earn in the future.\n\n### X = Daily Life\n\nThis type of X to Earn focuses on activities and works that people used to do on Web2, like creating content, providing service, chatting and meeting people, they may be categorised into SocialFi, and the form of the product is more likely to be a protocol rather than an application.\n\nSocialFi, as the name implies, is still related to finance, and token use cases are required. Take Cyberconnect and Project Galaxy as examples, one focuses on social graph while another focuses on data interoperability, their tokens do not have any actual use cases at the moment (one hasn’t ICO yet). If you were to say DAO or governance, then there is no different than a company shares. **Shares and stocks can be both used for speculation and vote/governance, one key element distinct from the two is people don’t buy shares to vote, but people buy tokens because of its utilities.**\n\nSocialFi will not come out as many imagined, because it’s a social, so it won’t or can’t have X to Earn like the traditional GameFi. A big challenge for the Daily Life X to Earn is quantification of work done and the design of the reward & punishment system. A low-frequency reward system may work better on this type of X to Earn, cause it may be high-frequency activities, it can’t be like Play to Earn where you get rewards instantly after a battle, or Move to Earn you get your earning instantly after you walked for 10 mins, or else even with earning cap the model can still collapse easily with guild or workshop.\n\nIf the project is to create incentives for activities that already exist in Web2, such as content creation (even just a simple Tweet), view, comment, etc., it should be done without the user’s awareness of the incentives. It will be a different tokenomic than the traditional X to Earn, more genuine use of the product is needed from users, when users have done certain amount of work, or reach a certain achievement, they will be rewarded with tokens or NFT, which could be Write to Earn, Sing to Earn, Talk to Earn. **Giving incentive to encourage users to be active is needed at different phases of the product life cycle.**\n\n### X = Entertainment\n\nWe are finally here! GameFi will be the main focus of the entertainment type of X to Earn.\n\n**It’s a good way to attract new users with a pump in token prices, and new users carrying new funds into the projects lead to an increase in token prices, this is a critical phase when the product is in its growth stage.** This brought us back to the core of growth, traffic. No matter we are in Web1,2,3,4,5, traffic is always the core of growth for all internet products, social media, eCommerce, game, traffic is always at the top of the conversion funnel.\n\nGaming is already a mature industry on PC and mobile, they all have sophisticated MOBA, MMORPG, and FPS games, not to mention gaming consoles like PlayStation, Xbox and Switch. It's undeniable that the progress of technology in AR and VR, will replaced many traditional games in the future, but does not mean we need to have super entertaining and great gameplay GameFi in the current phase, to replace the traditional ones.\n\nUnless a GameFi project can be as good as League of Legends, Fornite, players are willing to purchase skin to flex, or just simply like how they look, which these companies get billions of dollars in revenue each year. And now the question is, if the GameFi project team can create a game as good, why would they launch tokens and NFTs, why is it necessary to have financial attribute on gaming assets, why would they be so nice to share their revenue to all players.\n\nIn X to Earn for GameFi, X is “Gameplay”, Earn is “Earning”. **Gameplay and Earnings can’t be obtained at the same time, you can’t have your cake and eat it too, not absolute, but will be unproportional in most cases.**\n\n**If a GameFi went popular because of its gameplay, it won’t have high earnings, vice versa.**\n\nHere is why, if the GameFi went popular because of its gameplay, then users come for its gameplay, and now the team will be competing with traditional gaming developers which has developed for decades. And what made some of the great games survived through this highly competitive industry? Gameplay.\n\nIf the GameFi went popular because of its earnings, it’s predestined to have relatively less gameplay. The impact of crazy high APY result in users will not appreciate the gameplay seriously enough, most users are heading to maximising a highest APY. And project team will focuses on tokenomic and economic model to prevent from death spiral, the purpose of whatever “gameplay” or features that the team update is to stabilising the model and growth, instead of real gameplay.\n\nWe will see many GameFi projects exist on different point of the line graph shown below (*figure 1.0*), only the yellow point of high earnings GameFi will survive in short to mid term. The red point fun-to-play GameFi that focuses on gameplay like AAA game, they are almost identical to traditional game except your skin can be traded as NFT, is going to compete with the traditional gaming industry. However, looking forward to seeing the born of blue equilibrium point GameFi in the not too distant future, where playing GameFi can be an actual job to do for a living.\n\n![Figure 1.0](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oglFhRRN29y18iJ0LfB4Z.PNG?height=1371&width=1685)\n\n### Last\n\nAbove opinions and statements are personal, there is no paradigm for anything at the moment, if there is, means that it’s past tense, all stakeholders should keep embracing the new world, not limited by any given model and existent.\n\nNothing is impossible, everything is waiting to be discovered, isn’t this the beauty of the dangerous yet attractive new world?\n\n\\- To all dreamers and lonely builders in the bear market out there", "timestamp": 1658044795, "digest": "0vvVbT1AjBPDJIGoRr5la5jAju8vdkqlyls_wyWBOVY", "contributor": "0xDF81D6A1D0C05E04a5ea89117210aF8eeC2682E4"}

{"id": "BXYcE3AW_bpeIsFI0rhNotAx63_qCO7GtB0ghsQ6XP0", "title": "Web3 Gaming, AKA Play-to-Earn, Blockchain or NFT Games: Here to revolutionise gaming in unique ways and bring power to the players! 🎮", "body": "Web3 gaming, the ***decentralised and player-ownership-driven*** evolution of traditional gaming, is at the forefront of the overall web3 or blockchain revolution that seems to be the inevitable future of the internet. And it has a long, exciting way to go.\n\n### What is Web3 gaming?\n\nWeb3 gaming offers an innovative approach for participating in games with the help of blockchain technology, and it is best understood in contrast to its traditional Web2 counterparts.\n\nTraditionally, Web2 games have been completely housed on a **single centralized server** owned by a single authority. This places several limitations on various in-game assets purchased by players with fiat currency (also earned collectibles).\n\n### Ownership of purchased and earned in-game assets\n\nThe first limitation in traditional games is related to the ownership of in-game assets that have been purchased with fiat currency. Do players really own the assets they just purchased? \n\nNo, the **copyright** for these in-game assets is still owned by the central authority, and players simply own a licence for interacting with these assets within the game ecosystem. That is not true ownership, and it is something Web3 gaming deals with innovatively by giving players ownership of their purchased and earned assets through NFTs. This brings us to the second limitation.\n\n### Trading limitations on purchased and earned in-game assets\n\nPurchased items and collectibles in traditional games hold value only within the game ecosystem and similarly can only be traded within the games closed market/ecosystem. \n\nWeb3 games first give players true ownership of assets through NFTs and secondly give players the freedom to trade the rewards earned in-game on other platforms, even the ability to trade these rewards for ***other cryptocurrencies*** or fiat currency. This enables players to earn money through in-game efforts, making Web3 games **play-to-earn.**\n\nThese are the two most obvious limitations that Web3 gaming gives players freedom from; true **ownership** of their in-game purchased and earned assets and the **freedom to trade these assets** across platforms and even earn money if they so wish.\n\n### Security of In-game Assets and Buyer Information\n\nOne of the most striking features of Web3 games is the decentralized nature of the entire process, removing the vulnerability of a single point of failure and making the servers much more secure than traditional games. \n\nThis safeguards not only in-game information and assets but also buyer information, arguably just as, if not more important.\n\n### Popular Web3 games out there today:\n\nIf you have heard of Web3 games, you must know the names **Aavegotchi, Axie Infinity and Alien Worlds.** Here are some of the most popular, innovative and rewarding games in the web3 space today. We’re also looking out for more innovative games so send us a suggestion if we’ve missed out someone!** \n **\n\n### Aavegotchi 👻\n\nIf user reviews and community engagement are anything to go by, then Aavegotchi is an extremely addictive and exciting on-chain digital petting game where players own **NFTs avatars (or pets)** staked with interest-generating tokens which can be used to interact with the Aavegotchi Metaverse (**called Gotchiverse)**. \n\nThese digital pets also accrue greater value over time owing to the interest-generating tokens which back them the longer a player owns them.\n\nThe digital pets are Aavegotchis, pixelated ghosts living on the Ethereum/Polygon blockchain. Players can interact with these Aavegotchis in various ways, such as dressing them with in-game “wearables” and petting them, increasing their value. \n\nAn Aavegotchi’s overall value is a combination of the amount of staked collateral and its rarity, determined by its in-game wearables and traits. \n\nThe value of an Aavegotchi will determine its performance in the rarity farming minigame where players can earn $GHST tokens, which can be traded on an exchange for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. \n\nThe recent soft launch of the Gotchiverse was also a massive success, with players able to use their Gotchis to **“farm”** in-game resources called KEK, ALPHA, FUD and FOMO from land parcels. These resources themselves are ERC-20 tokens which are freely tradable, and the parcels are NFTs, again full decentralized and tradable. Completely different from the Web2 game assets we are used to!\n\nThe next big farming phase starts on July 20th: \n\n[https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1547584198910758920?s=20&t=KIWWHLLdUTpJPrxJ6eWOUQ](https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1547584198910758920?s=20&t=KIWWHLLdUTpJPrxJ6eWOUQ)\n\nFor a more detailed description, please read the following article: \n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-play-aavegotchi-beginners-guide](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-play-aavegotchi-beginners-guide)\n\n### Axie Infinity \n\nIf one had to explain Axie infinity to a complete newbie, it would be described as Blockchain or Web3 Pokemon; that is a pretty accurate description. \n\nIn this game, players own NFTs of unique monsters and pit them against each other in battles. Players are rewarded **SLP (smooth love potion)** for performing PVE (Player vs Environment) activities and engaging in PVP (Player vs Player) content. \n\nWhile there is a daily cap on how much SLP can be earned through PVE activities, the amount of SLP that can be **earned (or lost)** through PVP activities is uncapped. SLP tokens are used in conjunction with $AXS tokens to breed new Axies and thus has value in the game. SLP can also be traded on exchanges for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency.\n\nTo learn more about Axie, please read the following article: \n\n[https://gamewith.net/axie-infinity/](https://gamewith.net/axie-infinity/)\n\n### Alienworlds.io\n\nAlien worlds is a mining/exploration-themed NFT-metaverse game on the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and WAX blockchains. Players compete to mine Trilium (TLM Tokens) and can own **land parcels on alien plants** (where they can mine for TLM or commission others to do so), avatars, weapons, minions and tools as NFTs to be used in-game. \n\nPlayers play as an explorer of the metaverse in the **year 2055**. Players explore the metaverse, mine for Trilium and fight wars using their minions. Players also have a chance to receive NFT item trading cards while mining. Besides mining for TLM, players can also use their TLM for staking and voting in Planet DAOs to increase the planet's reward pool.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n[https://goodvibesmining.com/aliens-worlds-guide/](https://goodvibesmining.com/aliens-worlds-guide/)\n\nIt is extremely important to note that the most noticeable common thread and condition for success between all the most successful games would be the brilliant and engaged communities they thrive on. \n\nGame designers have known for a long time that the lifeblood of a booming game ecosystem and economy is a vibrant, engaged and authentic game community that is having fun interacting with not just the game and its ecosystem but also interacting and trading among themselves. ** \n **\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n** \n **Even the most cursory look at the Web3 gaming space is enough to give anyone the impression that Web3 gaming is here to stay, to make waves and bring about great change in the gaming industry. \n\nWeb3 and Metaverse games are poised to bring more power to the players by giving them true ownership of the assets they purchase and the rewards they earn in-game. \n\nThe first major implication of this change is that players get to exchange their in-game assets and rewards on major exchanges for cryptocurrencies or fiat currency; this is sure to see massive adoption, especially as more Web3 games come out to dominate the gaming space. Builders are already gearing up for a massive ***P2E gaming revolution.***\n\nVideo games have always thrived in the presence of massive and vibrant communities, and Web3 gaming will be an even more powerful example of this phenomenon. At the end of the day, if your community is not engaged and having fun, they will not stick around. That would be a major vibe killer for a game, no matter how well designed and incentivized it is. ** \n **\n\nAt Community Build, we strive to build organic and authentic communities for our brilliant Web3 founders and help them scale and realize their visions with the help of a brilliant and loyal community.

{"id": "dR0dxhyJgBDafkAblrJ4BCMqrajKWqRTbag4Xe6Bnjc", "title": "Tiny Bytes: TechoMagical World", "body": "Hi,\n\n\nI love SciFi and fantasy worlds. To be honest, I enjoy fantasy more. I’m not quite sure why. It may be I like the stories more. It might be a fascination with magic systems. Regardless of the reason, I tend to read and watch more fantasy stories. All that being said, the way technology plays a crucial role in creating new SciFi worlds fascinates me. This is especially true as I’ve spent more and more of my life learning about technology.\n\n\nThis eventually got me thinking: could technology build a traditional fantasy world? Could there be spells and magical creatures? How would this be enabled, and what would happen to our world to make it happen?\n\n\nPeople have definitely built worlds around this. A quick google search finds ideas of TechnoFantasy and Technomagic. I personally haven’t consumed any that match the world I was thinking of. I want a fantasy world with a magic system that’s internal logic is of a SciFi world.\n\n\nI don’t want a magical world that also has advanced technology\\*. I don’t want SciFi that has mystical unknowns in it. I don’t want steampunk or isekai. I don’t want magically infused machines.\n\n\nI want wizards who cast spells by writing code, and their wands store that code. I want ents that are talking trees enabled by robots. I giant mechanical, magical beasts like sand worms and dragons whose home has an automatic factory that breads them. I want orcs that are bred in a lab.\n\n\nI think it would be really fun to build such a world.\n\n\nNight,\nLucas\n\n\\*. When writing, I noticed that technology in a magical world bugged me for some reason. Not that it’s terrible, but I’m not sure if I’ve seen this power scaling work well. I think it’s because either magic is the better thing or technology is the better thing, and it’s hard to balance that scaling.

Web3基金不适合在香港注册，或以其为运营中心。在现有法规框架下，可以采用离岸基金模式，即将基金注册于离岸岛，将基金运营的部分后台职能外包给在香港的团队。\n\n## 展望\n\n对特区政府而言，香港面临着千载难逢的历史机遇，凭借国际金融中心的历史积淀，抓住内地Web2科技人才蜂涌出海创业的机会，只要能以海纳百川、敢立潮头的勇气，在监管框架上大胆突破，香港还是有可能成为亚洲Web3革命的发生地的。在制度上，希望特区在以下几方面能有所突破性创新：\n\n1. 先于美国和日本，将security token（证券通证）合法化，为合规Web3创业项目提供安全港。下一波Web3创新，必然以应用类的创新为主导，特别是那些将线下、链下现金流和利润与token挂钩的项目，如区块链游戏、创作者经济等面向普通用户的Web3应用。只要香港率先将security token合法化，且纳入简式证券监管，依托内地Web2创业大军在商业模式和To C应用创新方面全球性的竞争优势，香港将吸引大量内地科技人才来港创业，必将迎来Web3应用创新在香港的寒武大爆发。\n2. 在数字资产金融方面建章立制，但要适度监管、灵活监管，将重点放在反洗钱和保护散户投资者，除此之外，给予创业者宽松的监管环境，且发放牌照一视同仁，符合条件的都予发放，不给监管者过多的自由裁量权。\n3. 特区要拿出敢于承接、容纳南下科技创业者的勇气，给予更多的人才引进优惠政策，并与内地部门积极协调沟通，在创业者承诺不触碰内地市场的前提下，明确内地与香港管辖权划分的底线和尺度，给创业者明确的法规预期。\n\n下一站：新加坡。", "timestamp": 1658045630, "digest": "76ynNyyKBgrs9oLD5l2_xw6cw6t4vjiad9RRwrQbzX0", "contributor": "0xCa48Be2ceE86c3C1c9775B40cC20bD7fDcbEF436"}

Yes. And they are. Let me explain further.\n\n14/36现在你可能想问，不是几乎所有的生成艺术平台都号称作品是全链上的吗？的确如此。我再解释一下。\n\n15/36 The first thing you have to note is that storing any form of data on chain is incredibly expensive. Storing complex artworks fully on chain, one by one, is simply not feasible.\n\n15/36首先要知道的是，在链上存储任何形式的数据都是非常昂贵的。将复杂的艺术品一件一件地完全上链储存是不可行的。\n\n16/36 But with generative art, the script always stay the same, it’s only one input, the hash, that changes. Making it perfect for on chain storage. The way generative art platforms go fully on chain is usually by storing the art creation script on chain once.\n\n16/36但在生成艺术领域，代码是保持不变的，只有输入值、生成的哈希值会发生变化。这非常适合全链上存储。生成艺术平台完全上链的方式通常是将创作代码存储在区块链。\n\n17/36 With your unique hash + the art creation script, you can reconstruct your art piece from the on-chain data. Big asterisk, I think for less technical collectors, this is not an easy thing to do as it requires some technical skills to actually get your artwork from chain.\n\n17/36用你唯一的哈希值 + 艺术创作代码，你可以用链上数据重构艺术作品。我认为对于不太懂技术的藏家，这不是一件容易的事情，因为它需要一些技术才能真正从链中获取您的艺术品\n\n18/36 Even so, storing the art creation script on chain even once is quite expensive. Most often it is also done in a non gas-efficient way (and so considerably more expensive). It might be one of the reasons that the price of generative art is usually quite expensive as well.\n\n8/36即便如此，将艺术创作代码存储在链上，哪怕一次也是相当昂贵的。大多数情况下，是在非优化gas的方式下生成的(因此相当昂贵)。这可能是生成艺术的价格通常也相当昂贵的原因之一。\n\n19/36 On top of that, not all generative art platforms utilize the most recent improvements in ERC721 contracts, making gas cost to mint usually high as well.\n\n19/36最重要的是，并非所有的艺术平台都利用了 ERC721最新的优化，使得铸造的gas成本通常也很高。\n\n20/36 So how can we do better, from a purely technical perspective?\n\n* Make it easier to get the artwork directly from chain\n* Make it cheaper to launch new art series\n* Make sure we utilize recent improvements in ERC721 contracts to lower gas cost\n\n20/36那么，从纯技术的角度来看，怎样才能做得更好呢？\n\n* 从链上获取作品更简单\n* 推出新的艺术项目成本更低\n* 确保我们利用 ERC721的最新优化，降低gas成本\n\n21/36 We’ve managed to do all three with [@Mint256ART](https://twitter.com/Mint256ART). As a collector, I think the most important thing to know is that, well, it’s possible and we did it. But if you’d like a deeper dive into how we did it -> do read on. This next part will be more technical though.\n\n [@Mint256ART](https://twitter.com/Mint256ART).完成了这三方面的优化。作为一个收藏家，我认为最重要的是知道我们做到了。但如果你想深入了解我们是如何做到的，请继续读下去。不过接下来的部分将更加技术性。\n\n22/36 Let’s dive in with how to make it easier to get the artwork directly from chain. Our goal was to create a user-flow that any collector can perform, without the need of a bunch of technical knowledge. We realized that there is wide browser support for base64 encoded HTML.\n\n22/36让我们深入探讨一下如何更容易地从链上获得艺术品。我们的目标是创建一个每个藏家都可以执行的用户流，而不需要大量的技术知识。我们意识到浏览器对 base64编码的 HTML 有很好的支持。\n\n23/36 This means, that if you type a base64 string in your address bar, it will render the encoded HTML page. We created a function that does the base64 encoding of the HTML page (incl. art script and hash) entirely on chain.\n\n23/36这意味着，如果浏览器地址栏中输入 base64字符串，它将呈现已编码的 HTML 页面。我们创建了一个函数，它对链上的 HTML 页面(包括 艺术 脚本和 哈希地址)执行 base64编码。\n\n24/36 As a collector all you have to do is call getArtFromChain with your tokenId and copy paste the result in your address bar. This is not a link, this is the entire artwork, straight from the chain. No need for S3, IPFS or any other form of off-chain hosting or storage.\n\n作为一个藏家，你所要做的就是使用 tokenId 调用 getArtFromChain函数并将结果复制粘贴到地址栏中。这不是一个链接，是直接从链上获取的整个艺术品。不需要 S3服务器、 IPFS 或任何其他形式的链外主机或存储。\n\n26/36 You can also try it yourself from the project contract (only ids 0 – 8 as those are the only ones minted on the test contract):\n\n[https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x0c4969981e56b00eb83814a67b260aa9308a641d#readContract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x0c4969981e56b00eb83814a67b260aa9308a641d#readContract)\n\n26/36你可以在合约中自己尝试(只有 id 0-8，为测试而唯一生成的) 。\n\n在合约中找到getArtFromChain方法，输入0-8随便一个数字，点击Query，获得一个长篇的文本，复制整个文本到浏览器地址栏然后回车，艺术作品会在浏览器中开始渲染生成。\n\n27/36 Next up, let’s make it up to 10 times cheaper to launch new fully on chain generative art series. Yes, you read that right, up to 10 times cheaper.\n\n27/36接下来，我们可以以10倍的成本推出全新的生成艺术项目。是的，你没看错，成本下降10倍。\n\n28/36 Using the EIP-1167 standard for minimal proxy contracts, contract deployment becomes 10 times cheaper (after first contract) + storing the generative art script in the most efficient on chain way using “constant” rather than “memory” which is roughly 4 times cheaper too.\n\n28/36使用 EIP-1167最小代理合约，合约部署成本降低了10倍+，即使使用执行最高效的链上存储方式“常量”而不是“内存”来存储代码，也大约降了4倍成本。\n\n29/36 Factory contract: \n\n[https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xAf8d9c3a754DD3356Bf267Af5bA87aBda632da0f](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xAf8d9c3a754DD3356Bf267Af5bA87aBda632da0f)\n\nArtScript contract for above project: \n\n[https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x7dac85d1a718a7e0b26d471acf9406bd6838b3dc](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x7dac85d1a718a7e0b26d471acf9406bd6838b3dc)\n\n样例及样例项目中的生成艺术代码 \n 30/36 Last we can utilize recent improvements to ERC721 contracts to lower gas cost. Talented developers like [@nftchance](https://twitter.com/nftchance) have improved ERC721, gas cost to mint is 5x cheaper. Not utilizing these improvements is, in my opinion, doing a disservice to your collector community.\n\n30/36 最后，我们可以利用最近 ERC721 合约的改进来降低 gas 成本。像@nftchance 这样有才华的开发人员改进了 ERC721，铸造的 gas 成本便宜了 5 倍。在我看来，不利用这些优化是对你藏家社区的伤害\n\n31/36 With all of that said I’m super stoked for [@Mint256ART](https://twitter.com/Mint256ART), a new generative platform that will implement all of the above (and quite a few other non-technical improvements). We’re expecting the launch to be at the latest by the end of next month.\n\n说了这么多，我很兴奋的介绍一下 @Mint256ART ——一个新的生成艺术平台，将实现上述所有内容（以及许多其他非技术改进）。我们预计最迟会在下个月底推出。\n\n32/36 Notion with all info:\n\n[https://256art.notion.site/256ART-45d735feb9aa40af8e76d1cac10affec](https://256art.notion.site/256ART-45d735feb9aa40af8e76d1cac10affec)\n\n记录所有信息的notion地址如下\n\n[https://256art.notion.site/256ART-45d735feb9aa40af8e76d1cac10affec](https://256art.notion.site/256ART-45d735feb9aa40af8e76d1cac10affec)\n\n33/36 Crap I miscounted the Tweets.\n\n我数错了推特条数\n\n34/36 Don't mind me!\n\n不用理会我\n\n35/36 Close now.\n\n话题结束\n\n36/36 Thank you all for sticking around and reading until here, you're a hero!\n\n感谢各位阅读到这里，你是条汉子\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658046981, "digest": "pYpWZaOzvEjiha_va3LMFALvVR_t_iwnc8nX-p0U4HY", "contributor": "0x89D73DE516eFa8bff287925F8e593aB668779E15"}

Though Bitcoin itself cannot be regulated, federal control could stunt progress in [orange-pilling](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-orange-pill-theory-reality) nocoiners by making bitcoin less practical to access and exchange. Bitcoiners should support legislation that both simplifies the industry’s relationship with the U.S. government and offers protections against bureaucratic overreach.\n\nSenators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand’s [cryptocurrency legislation](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4356/text) is a highly [anticipated](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/us-senators-discuss-highly-anticipated-bitcoin-bill) and celebrated milestone in the industry as it recognizes the role that bitcoin plays in the U.S. economy and offers a regulatory framework for many of the gray areas that have plagued government interactions with the business of bitcoin. Among these, the [bill](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/heres-whats-in-senator-lummis-bitcoin-bill) would designate the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the regulatory body for cryptocurrency matters, define bitcoin as a commodity rather than a security, and improve market transparency for stablecoins. This approach could lead to more innovation and greater adoption of bitcoin as it is applied to everyday transactions.\n\nDespite the merits of the bill, Bitcoiners should be skeptical about this new policy direction in Washington, D.C., as a regulatory framework is no more restrictive on bureaucratic agencies than the edges of a blank canvas for a painter. The Lummis-Gillibrand bill [touts](https://www.lummis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Lummis-Gillibrand-Section-by-Section-Final.pdf) the creation of this framework but fails to implement any protections against the very entity that is threatened by the Bitcoin ethos of decentralizing wealth and rendering fiat obsolete: the federal government. By imposing a regulatory framework without implementing guards against bureaucratic overreach, the industry will be no safer after this bill is passed than it is today. In fact, one can argue the industry will be less safe because bureaucrats will be allowed to focus their regulatory efforts on the industry instead of fighting each other for control.\n\nThough Senator Lummis has [discussed](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/senator-lummis-details-new-bitcoin-bill) passing cryptocurrency legislation for some time now, the recent push for its passage appears to be driven by investors [fleeing](https://www.grid.news/story/technology/2022/06/27/why-the-crypto-crash-is-fueling-calls-for-regulation/) to the government for rescue after the liquidation crisis of the last few months. Proponents of more regulation are not the everyday HODLers who believe in the principle of decentralized wealth and financial freedom. Rather, they are the modern-day gold prospectors attempting to leverage the get-rich-quick ploys of altcoins to expand their wealth in fiat. Yet, their cries for regulation are presented as consensus from the cryptocurrency industry, incidentally sweeping Bitcoiners into the new regulatory scene despite their noninvolvement in the crisis.\n\nIn Bitcoin’s truly trustless system of financial accountability, there is no need for regulation. Because of this, there really is no need to regulate the remainder of the cryptocurrency market either. Consumers hate nothing more than being scammed. As altcoin fads come and go, it becomes apparent that bitcoin has staying power and investors will eventually stop supporting failing, unstable and pseudo-decentralized coins. If there is anything that we have learned over the past two months, it is that Bitcoin is the model for laissez-faire capitalism operating in a self-regulated system.\n\nIt is very dangerous to seek the government as the ultimate solution to problems that exist in a free market. Especially when issues were caused by a product’s poor durability responding to bad market management by those same regulators.\n\nThe issue with additional regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges is that the government would acquire more tailored control of the market and limit financial freedom. This effect is especially potent as bitcoin integrates with the market by becoming a payment option for the average consumer. Businesses, not bitcoin, will become the target as few of them would be willing to risk the consequences for defying government overreach.\n\nBitcoin is designed to be the escape hatch from the federal government’s poor management of the market. At present, [historic](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/inflation-angst-causes-dramatic-shift-in-spending-and-savings-habits-1031561075) inflation is making ordinary activities like driving to work and eating three square meals a day practically cost-prohibitive. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is dangerously close to [overcorrecting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-is-practically-engineering-a-recession-regulation-fed-economy-taxation-supply-unemployment-11655924530) the situation, threatening to send the economy into a recession that could rival what we experienced in 2008. Given this track record, it would be unwise to grant the present stewards of the American economy any control of people’s access to their only means of escape.\n\nThough the Lummis-Gillibrand bill is a start to clarifying the law and recognizing bitcoin as a viable store of value, there needs to be provisions that protect the industry from the regulators themselves. There should be protections that recognize your right to own and keep your bitcoin, limit the latitude executive agencies have when interpreting their role within the regulatory framework, and recognize one’s right to financial privacy as guaranteed by the fourth amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Regulating the regulators would limit overreach and support the rights to financial privacy and property in their most perfect form.\n\nOne should remember that bitcoin is not intended to be an ordinary investment, but a movement built on the principle that financial freedom should be accessible to all and absent market manipulation by any government, company, group or individual. Investors voluntarily calling for the restriction of this right are holding bitcoin for the wrong reasons and entirely miss the point of this grand experiment.\n\nBitcoiners must not only HODL their bitcoin on the basis of their belief that it is a superior store of value. They must also apply this principle to the sphere of public policy: “Politically HODLing” on the basis that bitcoin requires no regulation as the superior trustless system it is. It is important to both support public policies that clarify the law, encourage innovation and open the market, while opposing those that create inroads for bureaucrats to regulate at will. Without this political vigilance, Bitcoiners are in danger of losing the culture war between the Fed and true financial liberty.\n\n*This is a guest post by** Niklas Kleinworth**.

{"id": "3O7fy9KleQZqTspyng7ULB6p8jWMUFsY89JFxUGowNg", "title": "What’s Next For Bold Bitcoin-Buyer MicroStrategy?", "body": "MicroStrategy (MSTR) currently sits on a huge loss on their bitcoin purchases. Based on a current bitcoin price of $20,300, their 129,699 aggregate bitcoin holdings are worth $2.6 billion, down from a total purchase cost of roughly $4 billion (average cost $30,700). Hence they are sitting on unrealized losses of \\~$1.4 billion on their purchases.\n\nThe last couple of years have been a wild ride for MSTR shareholders, and ironically, the share price ($186) doesn’t sit that far above the share price in the summer of 2020 when they announced their first bitcoin purchase (approximately $140).\n\nMichael Saylor has appeared bemused by the continuous speculation online at MSTR having their bitcoin holdings liquidated at around $21,000 due to the recent $200 million loan with Silvergate. Even searching for Michael Saylor’s name on Twitter brought up the auto-complete phrase “Michael Saylor liquidated.”\n\nThis speculation is pretty misleading, but even still, where does the recent market turmoil in Bitcoin leave them? To consider this, let’s simply outline the terms of the various debts they have taken on in the last couple of years, including that Silvergate loan.\n\n## First Convertible Note Offering — December 2020\n\n[MicroStrategy Completes $650 Million Offering of 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025](https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/press-release-archive/MicroStrategy-Completes-650-Million-Offering-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Due-2025.pdf)\n\nThe first convertible note offering was for $650 million, due in December 2025. The interest rate payable for these by MSTR was just 0.75%, making the servicing of this debt pretty easy — just under $5 million interest cost per year.\n\nHence, these convertible bond holders are not receiving much interest, but they do have the option to convert their investment to MSTR shares at $398 per share. Thus this represents a type of call option on the future price of MSTR shares, albeit one which is now worth less at current market prices.\n\nTo illustrate the convertible part, let’s say MSTR stock is priced at $500 per share at the redemption date in Dec 2025 — if you had $1 million of convertible notes they would then be worth $1.25 million, since you could buy the shares for $398 and immediately sell them for $500. This, and other upside scenarios, explain the low interest rate payable.\n\n## Second Convertible Note Offering — February 2021\n\n[MicroStrategy Completes $1.05 Billion Offering of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2027 at 0% Coupon and 50% Conversion Premium](https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/press-release-archive/microstrategy-completes-1-05b-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes-due-2027\\_02-19-2021.pdf)\n\nThis offering (which raised $1.05bn) is much along the same structure as the first, albeit at even better terms from an MSTR point of view, and worse terms for the convertible bond holders. This time, the interest rate is 0%, so there is no interest cost and the redemption date is in February 2027.\n\nThe convertibility for these notes only contains value if the share price of MSTR is above $1,432 per share — hence much less likely to be converted than the previous offering. It seemed comparatively more likely at the time, given the stock price closed at $955 on February 16, 2021.\n\nSkeptics will question the virtue of raising this much debt to buy bitcoin, but one element seems clear in hindsight — MSTR and Michael Saylor got a pretty good deal in borrowing on these terms at the time.\n\n## Senior Secured Notes — June 2021\n\n[MicroStrategy Completes $500 Million Offering of 6.125% Senior Secured Notes Due 2028 With Bitcoin Use Of Proceeds](https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/press-release-archive/microstrategy-completes-500m-offering-of-senior-secured-notes-due-2028-with-bitcoin-use-of-proceeds\\_06-14-2021.pdf)\n\nThis represented a more conventional bond offering. MSTR borrowed $500 million until 2028, at an annual interest rate of 6.125%. This makes the annual interest cost of these bonds approximately $30.6 million, substantially more than the previous convertible notes interest cost combined.\n\nThis announcement also coincided with the [establishment of a subsidiary](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-macrostrategy-bitcoin-arm) — “MacroStrategy” — which would hold the existing 92,079 bitcoin that they owned. While the new debt was senior secured notes — having a high priority of being paid versus other creditors in the event of future insolvency — crucially they are not secured against the 92,079 bitcoin. This becomes relevant when we consider the later Silvergate bitcoin-backed loan.\n\n## Silvergate Bank Loan — March 2022\n\nThis loan was slightly different — borrowing $205 million for three years which is backed by the MacroStrategy-held bitcoin. As linked to in slides 11 and 12 in this presentation, this was initially backed by 19,466 bitcoin, but more can be specifically pledged as collateral should the price of bitcoin fall.\n\n[First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Presentation](https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/events-presentations/Q1-2022\\_microstrategy-earnings-presentation.pdf)\n\nThe “top up” loan-to-collateral-value ratio is 50%. It is this fact that has presumably led many to cite the MSTR liquidation price on the loan as the price of bitcoin falling below $21,000 — at this point the 19,466 bitcoins would be worth below $410 million (2 x 205), and they would need to pledge more collateral under the terms of the loan. But as Michael Saylor pointed out and the slides above show, there are a further 95,643 bitcoins which have not yet been pledged, and could be.\n\n*[Linked MicroStrategy Investor Relations Tweet.](https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1523996525151539203?s=20\\&t=XVBm3Dy7szTz4HufFPB0yQ)*\n\nThe math works as follows regarding the $3,562 referenced in the tweet. At that price point the total 115,109 bitcoin available to back the loan would be only worth $410m, so MicroStrategy would have to pledge some other collateral to keep the 50% loan-to-value ratio going.\n\nHow about the interest cost on this loan? It’s based on the 30-day average SOFR (Secured Overnight Funding Rate) plus 3.7%. At the time of writing (end of June, 2022) SOFR is about 1%, so this makes 4.7% total. Based on 4.7% interest, it would cost them about $9.6 million annually to service the interest currently. However, the 1% SOFR rate is expected to go higher. Further SOFR rises would not prove too material though — at 4%, for example, (and hence 7.7% total) the interest cost would be $15.8 million.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nSo what can we conclude from all this?\n\n1\\. The interest costs in total from all the debt raised to buy bitcoin look manageable, totalling around $45 million ($5m + $0 + $30.6m + $9.6m) per year at present. This looks affordable to service — [the recent quarterly results](https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/press-release-archive/microstrategy-announces-first-quarter-2022-financial-results\\_05-03-2022.pdf) show gross profit for the recent quarter at $94 million.\n\n[MicroStrategy Announces First Quarter 2022 Financial Results](https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/press-release-archive/microstrategy-announces-first-quarter-2022-financial-results\\_05-03-2022.pdf)\n\n2\\. Even given huge recent declines in the price of bitcoin, MSTR’s holdings should not be impacted by the price in the short term, unless it falls massively, to $3,500k. This is due to the sheer amount of bitcoin they have available to back the Silvergate loan, to keep the backing at a 50% loan-to-value ratio.\n\n3\\. What is of course striking is the current huge on-paper loss that MSTR is sitting on in terms of its bitcoin purchases, given that their average cost basis is $30,700 per bitcoin. It would no doubt prove a problem for them if the bitcoin price remains below this in the longer term and some of the debt starts to near redemption. The first loan due is the Silvergate loan in March 2025. Given this is with bitcoin backed as collateral, it may actually be possible to roll this over in a similar fashion.\n\nThe next due is the first convertible note offering in December 2025. If MSTR is still sitting on huge bitcoin losses at this point, they may find it hard to roll over that $650 million debt in the market. It would lead to a tricky decision as they would presumably want to avoid selling any bitcoin at a loss in order to pay back the debt.\n\nOne aspect is very much on their side, though: In the world of Bitcoin, or indeed even the wider macroeconomic environment, December 2025 feels like a very long time away.\n\n4\\. It seems unlikely that MSTR would seek (or indeed be able) to raise much more debt in current market conditions — as Michael Saylor points out in the interview clip below, they borrowed previously on pretty advantageous terms. It also seems unlikely right now that they would sell additional equity into the market to buy more bitcoin, which they have also done previously, as the share price is currently so low.\n\n5\\. They could carry on buying more bitcoin with profits and indeed, while writing this, MSTR did [announce](https://decrypt.co/104076/microstrategy-buys-more-bitcoin-despite-price-crash-20k) a further small bitcoin purchase of $10 million.\n\n6\\. What seems likely alongside this is opting to keep some future profits in dollars for optionality over the next couple of years rather than buy more bitcoin with it, despite bitcoin’s lower price. The Q1 2022 results linked above (see point 1) would suggest that they are currently building some cash reserves, holding $93 million in cash versus $63 million three months earlier.\n\n7\\. One final option would be to buy back some of their own shares with profits from the business, given that their share price has declined by a higher proportion over the last 6-12 months than the bitcoin price. This essentially would send a signal that the market undervalues MSTR relative to even the bitcoin price, and would constitute a defiant, albeit risky, show of faith in their strategy.\n\nFinally, it’s worth watching [this video link from CNBC](https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1537101902432940032) for some recent thoughts from Michael Saylor, which includes the following quotes:\n\nInterviewer: “Would you consider buying more?”\n\nMichael Saylor: “Yeah. If your time horizon is one month, then Bitcoin looks like a volatile risk asset. But if your time horizon is ten years, it looks like a risk off store of value asset ...”\n\n> “... we borrowed 2.2 billion dollars at a blended interest rate of 1.8% before interest rates doubled. It seemed like a reasonable thing to do. $1.7 billion is unsecured, the rest is a 7 year term after we borrowed the money. The margin loan is well managed ...” \n>\n> “... Bitcoin is the first and only legitimate scarcity in the universe.”\n\n*None of the content in this article should be construed as financial advice or taken as an endorsement to buy or sell shares in MSTR.

Upon landfall, two leaders mutinied to return to Cuba at the order of the governor who had commissioned the fleet Cortés led. In response, [Cortés scuttled his fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire#Scuttling_the_fleet_and_aftermath) to forestall any future mutiny by closing the sole path of retreat.\n\nAgainst all odds, Cortés went on to defeat an opposing force of over 300,000 Aztecs, a few thousand Spaniards, superior military technology, an unforeseen smallpox outbreak, and shrewd political alliances ultimately prevailed.\n\nMany of those on the expedition had never seen combat before, including Cortés himself. Historians will point to August 13, 1521, as the final victory of the Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire. However, Cortés truly won the moment he “burned the ships.”\n\nAt its core, the metaphor of “burning the ships” represents the point of no return: the psychological commitment to crossing a [line in the sand](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/A_Line_in_the_Sand.html?id=iDFd\\_1yaAdgC\\&redir_esc=y) once and for all.

From now on, everything — all thoughts and efforts — must be focused on succeeding in the new reality.\n\nLike Cortés, Bitcoiners have crossed the Atlantic to the promised land. However, while Bitcoiners still use fiat money, we will not be truly free. Until we burn the ships, we will not win.\n\n[Bitcoiners are the remnant](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-are-the-remnant). We lead by example. We must show the world we are not afraid to live on a bitcoin standard. We must use bitcoin not just as our store of value but as the unit of account and medium of exchange for our daily lives.\n\nWe must strive for peace and prosperity, by building circular bitcoin economies that remain resilient against the volatility of the fiat exchange rate. We must keep studying to build the knowledge and intellectual depth upon which rigorous discourse can thrive. We must build large stacks upon which generational wealth is built. In the end, [only the strong survive](https://www.uncerto.com/only-the-strong-survive).\n\nThere is a nascent movement in the Bitcoin cultural sphere known as [#GetOnZero](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetOnZero?src=hashtag_click) which polarizes many people. This movement represents “burning the ships.” This state change is both functional and psychological. It drives companies to build better products for Bitcoiners. It drives Bitcoiners to harden our resolve as Bitcoiners. It [shows we are willing to go down with the ship](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/relish-the-price-dip-its-bitcoin-or-nothing). It proves we are fearless in the face of insurmountable odds.\n\n“[Give me Bitcoin or give me death](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/patrick.asp).”\n\nThe [critics](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-we-cant-completely-abandon-fiat-for-bitcoin-yet) will say it’s “too early” or point to statistics in an attempt to rationalize why holding some fiat currency is better. While such notions may seem correct on paper, in practice, until Bitcoiners take that grand leap of faith, we are not prepared to do what it takes to win. Until we are ready to completely let go of fiat currency, it will continue to culturally and functionally survive. Bitcoiners, like Cortés, must embrace burning the ships. Once we do, the process of hyperbitcoinization already underway will rapidly accelerate.\n\nThe moment Bitcoiners burn the ships is the moment Bitcoiners win.\n\n<https://getonzerofiat.com/>\n\n*This is a guest post by Interstellar Bitcoin.

{"id": "uZLbxWsjdW3-ELhpuL-ulsKfGqyqAiV7fpOtuRDw1tY", "title": "Scoring Bitcoin Points Like Digital Airline Miles", "body": "*This is an opinion editorial by **Michael Rhee**, the founder of Wavlake and a contributor at Bitcoin Magazine.*\n\nEveryone loves keeping score. From likes and mentions on social media to airline miles and Starbucks Rewards, points tell us exactly where we stand in the commercial world. On social media platforms, they can mean more eyeballs and a feeling of validation. In the world of airlines and coffee shops, they can mean more free trips and frappuccinos.\n\nToday, each of these scores lives in a walled garden. Like a gift card to your favorite store, these points are only redeemable at one place and are locked within a bounded context. I can’t convert the likes on my tweets to free coffees. Nor can I turn the views on my YouTube videos into discounted hotel stays.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nImagine a point system on the internet that everyone used, and could freely traverse a variety of platforms and applications, providing a unified definition of value across them all.\n\nIf visions of the coming metaverse are true, then this kind of interoperability will be the fabric that weaves it all together. I believe that bitcoin has a key role to play in building a more unified commercial world — both on and off the internet — serving as a single, shared measure of value that can move across real and virtual borders with no friction.\n\nAs the founder of Wavlake, I’m trying to build this world. [Wavlake](https://www.wavlake.com/) is a way for music listeners to directly support the artists they love, using bitcoin micropayments. It is part of a larger ecosystem of internet services that run on an open, interoperable standard for bitcoin payments. We’re witnessing the early stages of this dramatic change already. On [Stacker News](https://stacker.news/), users reward each other for posts and comments they like using small amounts of bitcoin. Commenters can then withdraw that bitcoin from the site and use it to tip musicians on Wavlake. Those same musicians can use their awarded bitcoin to stream podcasts on pay-by-the-minute players like Breez or Fountain. Podcasters can then take that same bitcoin and convert it into U.S. dollars using Cash App, or turn it into a gift card with [Bitrefill](https://bitrefill.com/).\n\nTo create this same unified experience with dollars would require careful coordination and cooperation between every closed payment network in the world. That means Venmo would have to work with Zelle and vice-versa, along with every other dollar-based payment app in existence. In contrast, Bitcoin’s open standards and permissionless nature uniquely enable any service to seamlessly integrate with every other Bitcoin service imaginable, without planning or mandate.\n\nThese unified commercial worlds are still small and experimental, but hold huge potential for our society and economy. As bitcoin adoption continues to grow, we will gradually close the loop and create a truly global, commercial system. Naysayers will finally be able to buy — or get a free — cup of coffee using bitcoin, throwing away the notion that it’s a useless and frivolous technology. This is the point at which Bitcoin fades into the background and becomes invisible, like the electricity powering your desk lamp.\n\nThis possible future state makes me wonder: Maybe not everyone needs to understand Austrian economics or triple-entry accounting or the Byzantine generals problem or how central banking works or [WTF happened in 1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) — or any of the other, myriad frameworks for explaining this complex system we call the economy. Maybe most people don’t need any of this to “get” Bitcoin, in the same way I don’t need to know how to build every component of a phone in order to understand its value.\n\nAt some point in the future, bitcoin becomes the measure of our world. It will be just like airline miles, but for everything.\n\n*This is a guest post by **Michael Rhee**.

{"id": "aq2ct3THOK2-R17hscIdV1LmMH2P2zVY5CRjmGRbJCg", "title": "[趋势交易系列1]黄金分割线（斐波那契回撤）", "body": "### 基本信息\n\n斐波纳契回撤理论，是股票上也常到的经典理论之一，是建立在两个端点间的趋势线。斐波纳契回撤理论是斐波那契 \\[1\\]  Leonardo Fibonacci发现的数字逻辑推论，即每一个随后的数据是前两个数字的总和：1、1、2、3、5、8、13、21、34、55、89、144等等。\n\n每个数据约等于前一个的1.618倍，且每个前一数据相对于后一数据的0.618。此工具是运用决定的趋势线上两点来创建的。然后画出9条水平线，斐波纳契水平：0.0%，23.6%，38.2%，50%，61.8%，100%，161.8%，261.8%和 423.6%与趋势线交叉。\n\n### 怎么分析，及应用\n\n连接阶段性的高点和低点，拖动方向，时间点从前往后拖动。以空头行情为例，起点从高点拖动到一个阶段性的低点。\n\n如下图所示，从高点向低点拖动。\n\n> `下图用TradingView所画，大部份行情软件都支持斐波那契回撤）`\n\n![斐波纳契回撤分析图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gehAOv8LKT2_ANF7DBbPf.png?height=724&width=2342)\n\n### 参数详解\n\n个人推荐只看3个参数点位：0.38（38%），0.5（50%），0.618（61.8%）。\n\n反弹到38.2%是一个弱回调，后市可能还有一波强力的回调。\n\n如果从低反弹到了50%线，表示下跌趋势中的正常回调。\n\n如果回调超过61.8%说明趋势有可能反转。\n\n操作上，下跌趋势中，在跌破38.2%的位置可以尝试开空，在突破61.8%可尝试开多。\n\n### 案例分析\n\n#### 案例1（上升趋势中的下跌分析，ETH-4小时线）\n\n![案例1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YlMpNOqFHvbPt_P9h6o36.png?height=724&width=2342)\n\n起点（高点）2021-01-10, ETH：1348\n终点（低点）2021-01-11, ETH: 914.25\n\n在2021-01-14，ETH反弹到1182，突破了61.8%。一波趋势在2021-01-19突破新高达到1436。\n\n#### 案例2（上升趋势中的下跌分析，ETH-4小时线。）\n\n![案例2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J90HeiMd9UfptpRi2NUD_.png?height=1262&width=2534)\n\n起点（高点）2021-01-19, ETH：1437\n\n终点（低点）2021-01-22, ETH: 1046\n\n在2021-01-24，ETH反弹到1287，突破了61.8%。在2021-01-27，2021-01-28试探回踩了50%线后，一路上扬连连破新高。\n\n#### 案例3（上升趋势中的下跌分析，ETH-4小时线。）\n\n![案例3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7tfboKDDLFQaH6AflQOSc.png?height=1268&width=2508)\n\n起点（高点）2021-01-20, ETH：2040\n\n终点（低点）2021-01-28, ETH: 1300\n\n在2021-03-08，ETH反弹到1760，突破了61.8%。在2021-03-14号突破1950失败，下路下扬跌到1543，刚好守住38.2%线。之后在2021-03-21再次突破后61.8%，一路上扬破新高。\n\n这次案例，并非向前两次那样突破后一路上扬，最终还跌到了38.2%线。但最终守住，才有了后面了再次暴涨。所以在用斐波那契回撤分析时，可以理解为在多空双方博弈中，0.618，0.5，0.382关键点位争夺区间。谁突破了就是谁强，在操作上。可按突破0.618做多，跌破0.618止损。再次突破0.618则做多，即使判断失败，亏损也不会太大。\n\n#### 上升趋势中的下跌总结\n\n上升趋势中，即使刚突破后0.618，再后面几个周期，有大概率还会再次回踩0.618，如果已做多回踩到0.618可平仓，等再次突破0.618，再次进场会更加安全。\n\n### 总结\n\n斐波那契回撤只是技术参考指标之一，在分析2021年牛市的K线图时，有些连续行情连回调都没有，如果一直等待斐波那契回撤发出信号，可能就要错失很多机会。所以技术分析可以多样化，有好的入场信号就应该进场，有不好的信号就应该离场。\n\n> 友情提醒：交易应该设好严格的止损，远离高倍杠杆，拒绝梭哈。交易不是赌博，是长期的心理博弈。\n>\n> 链DeFi介绍：中文DeFi社区。遵循趋势交易，分享干货知识，为DeFi爱好者、交易者、投资者服务。 \n>\n>  \n 欢迎关注我们的[Twitter](https://twitter.com/animahong)和[电报](https://t.me/liandefi)交流群，会持续分享更多有用的技术指标与分析方法。", "timestamp": 1658049247, "digest": "aSON7gqW12kZQn42UCVcPcPzk42z-ZJTpyjBlCg4Zz4", "contributor": "0xEe39D94ee2Fc50ed020faEdFABDB1850f6dc7eea"}

Less than one year in, an ecosystem is forming, with dozens of teams worldwide working on it. Now is the time to advance the decentralization of the network, so it achieves the liveness, censorship resistance, transparency and inclusivity demanded of an L2 on Ethereum.\n\nDecentralization means the network’s operation and evolution will not rely on any single entity, including StarkWare. A permissionless proof-of-stake leader election mechanism and on-chain payment of transaction fees, both using a native token, will enable the network to operate reliably as an L2 on Ethereum even should StarkWare cease to exist. Decisions regarding the ongoing maintenance of StarkNet will shift from StarkWare to the community. A StarkNet Token and Foundation will be key elements of this effort.\n\nThis post, the first of three published simultaneously, summarizes StarkNet’s journey thus far and introduces the StarkNet Token and the StarkNet Foundation. The [next post](https://medium.com/@starkware/part-2-a-decentralization-and-governance-proposal-for-starknet-23e335645778) discusses the StarkNet governance model and the [third](https://medium.com/@starkware/part-3-starknet-token-design-5cc17af066c6) focuses on StarkNet’s token model.\n\n*We thank the following StarkNet supporters (alphabetically ordered) for their comments on a draft of these posts: Guily_Gioza (Topology), Itamar Lesuisse (Argent), Jonas Nelle (Pontis), Martin Triay (OpenZeppelin), Polynya, Sylve Chevet (Briq), and Tomasz Stańczak (Nethermind).*\n\n# The story so far\n\n[StarkNet](https://starknet.io/) is built from cryptography and an open ecosystem. The **cryptography** is **[STARKs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf)**. These are protocols based on math that scale Ethereum by orders of magnitude. They require no trusted setup, are post-quantum secure, and can be deployed succinctly at any scale. The ecosystem is composed of core developers who have wanted for years to build infrastructure and tools for scaling blockchain technology, as well as new and creative application domains that become possible when the computational power of Ethereum is expanded.\n\nStarkNet gives all developers and users access to the scale and security benefits of STARKs, for the purpose of scaling Ethereum while maintaining Ethereum’s core values. STARKs were invented by co-founders of StarkWare, who first used them to build the [StarkEx](https://starkware.co/starkex/) scaling solution for clients. Subsequently, StarkWare and other developer teams (collectively “Core Contributors”) built [StarkNet](https://starkware.co/starknet/), a public, decentralized, and permissionless infrastructure, to ensure that these scaling technologies are accessible to all in perpetuity.\n\nThe launch of StarkNet Alpha nearly a year ago prompted the emergence of a larger ecosystem that is committed to build and nurture StarkNet. There are numerous teams of developers worldwide building its core infrastructure, as well as new applications on it.\n\n# The way to decentralize\n\nSTARK technology is mature and secure, but StarkNet has not achieved the status of a public good like Ethereum or the Internet. For StarkNet to reach this goal, its governance, operation and development must continue to decentralize. This will be facilitated through two mechanisms: the **StarkNet Foundation** and the **StarkNet Token**.\n\n## Foundation\n\nAs a non-profit, the Foundation’s mission will be to maintain StarkNet as a public good — a commodity or service that is made available to all members of society. StarkNet is permissionless infrastructure that should be available to all. It must be well maintained in order to be safe and efficient for public usage. It also must not discriminate between users.\n\nThe Foundation will be funded by a one-time grant of StarkNet Tokens. It will encourage the development of bottom-up mechanisms for community decision-making on essential technological questions, such as protocol updates, dispute resolution, and public goods funding.\n\n## Token\n\nThe StarkNet Token is needed to operate the ecosystem, maintain and secure it, decide on its values and strategic goals, and direct its evolution. This token will be required for (i) governance, (ii) payment of transaction fees on StarkNet, and (iii) participation in StarkNet’s consensus mechanism.\n\nWe have minted an initial ten billion tokens which are being allocated to Core Contributors of the StarkNet ecosystem including StarkWare and StarkWare’s investors, to StarkNet software developer partners, and to the Foundation. Soon (target: September 2022) the token will go on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and be requested for use in governance and voting on network upgrades. Later, StarkNet fees will be paid only in this token, while ensuring good user experience for users interested in paying fees in ETH. Later still, automatic minting of additional StarkNet Tokens will commence, (i.e., the number of circulating tokens will be greater than ten billion).\n\nThe StarkNet Token model emphasizes compensating developers for their work. A portion of new minting and transaction fees — fees assessed for use of StarkNet — will be granted to core infrastructure developers and smart contract developers for the work they have done to design and launch the protocol, in addition to compensating StarkNet operators for the work they have done to operate it.\n\nThe full rationale behind a new and dedicated StarkNet Token is explained in our [second post](https://medium.com/@starkware/part-2-a-decentralization-and-governance-proposal-for-starknet-23e335645778), and the StarkNet Token design principles and initial allocatio", "timestamp": 1658049179, "digest": "eQ4BMaN9dw3I-0KHqNd4f3TkzhRq6nGu6k8aWuaOKGc", "contributor": "0x98B4916B6a53F6984e0d4dA7104145462a4019BE"}

All reality is of two types: the material (“matter” / “physical universe” / “space-time continuum”) and  the non-material (“ethereal” / “spiritual”).***\n\n**1.1**: The elementary subatomic particles that comprise matter exhibit wavelike behaviour. Thus matter is “radiation”.\n\n1\\.1.1: Everything that can be perceived by the human bodily senses directly or with the aid of material tools is material radiation.\n\n1\\.1.2: Matter has no inherent life i.e. it has no inherent will, motive, or consciousness.\n\n**1.2.** The material universe is a derivative of the non-material universe.\n\n1\\.2.1: A derivative always expresses an element of the nature of the source.\n\n    1.2.1.1: Material radiations/particles reflect elements of pre-existing non-material radiations.\n\n1\\.2.2: Consciousness is a property of non-materiality. It is not a property of matter.\n\n    1.2.2.1: There exist higher (more complex) and lower (simpler) states of non-material radiation. Thus there are higher and lower states of consciousness.\n\n    1.2.2.2: The urge to achieve a higher state of consciousness is inherent in the nature of non-material substance.\n\n1\\.2.3: The non-material can give rise to both non-materiality and materiality. Materiality can only give rise to materiality.\n\n**1.3**: Under specific conditions, it is possible for non-materiality to amalgamate with matter, thus forming a single continuum.\n\n1\\.3.1: The amalgamation of the non-material with materiality gives rise to “life” in the material world.\n\n**1.4:** Man is a non-material species - a “spirit”.\n\n1\\.4.1: The spirit possesses consciousness and has an inherent urge to achieve greater consciousness.  \n\n1\\.4.2: Man on earth is a spirit temporarily amalgamated with matter in the form of a physical body.\n\n      1.4.2.1: The amalgamation of the spirit and the body gives the material body a form of consciousness.\n\n          1.4.2.1.1: Physical man can be said to have two consciousnesses: the permanent spiritual consciousness that is inherent in his spirituality and a temporal pseudo-consciousness (“mental” or “brain” consciousness) that arises from the spirit’s connection to the body.\n\n**1.5:** The exercise of decision-making influences the consciousness of the decision-making agent.\n\n1\\.5.1: Within his physical body man makes decisions originating from the interaction of his consciousnesses.  \n\n1\\.5.2: Man’s brain can form thoughts. Therefore thoughts are material (1.2.3).\n\n      1.5.2.1: Thoughts may be stimulated by material influences perceived in and through the body.\n\n      1.5.2.2: Thoughts may be stimulated by non-material influences perceived through the spirit.\n\n      1.5.2.3: The exercise of thinking, acting in response to a thought, and experiencing the effects of the action influence the (temporal) consciousness of the brain.  \n\n1\\.5.3: Man’s spirit can make decisions.\n\n      1.5.3.1: Decisions of the spirit (“will”, “volition”) are non-material.\n\n      1.5.3.2: A decision of the spirit can give rise to non-materiality and materiality (\\*\\*1.2.3\\*\\*).\n\n          1.5.3.2.1: The spiritual decision always has spiritual effects. It may or may not result in an observable material effect depending on the degree of \"cooperation\" of the brain with the body and the body with the brain.\n\n          1.5.3.2.2: A spiritual will/volition can stimulate the brain’s thinking process.\n\n      1.5.3.3: A decision of the spirit is imperceptible to the brain unless and until thoughts are generated from the originating will, which may be stronger or weaker.\n\n      1.5.3.4: Man's spirit can perceive non-material influences. These can affect his spiritual decisions.\n\n      1.5.3.5: The exercise of perceiving non-material influences (the “inner voice”), making spiritual decisions accordingly, developing thoughts in compliance with the spiritual decision, carrying out material actions in alignment with such thoughts, and then experiencing the effects influences the spirit’s consciousness.\n\n          1.5.3.5.1: Greater spiritual consciousness is achieved by the continuous experiencing resulting from aligning material actions with spiritual will.  \n\n1\\.5.4: Spiritual consciousness/maturity is not correlated with mental consciousness/maturity.", "timestamp": 1658049307, "digest": "MM1zgbFadOo0MHiqQR1y0iW9Ew4EwwkQam9vLOkiapE", "contributor": "0x40cC95F5056EE6e3e6449A78A2a2Efa2d29d22f9"}

{"id": "6PxOdNf2b932_RkeUkzEI8AxK7UDD37lLJleusHUvR0", "title": "EIP-4519: Non-Fungible Tokens Tied to Physical Assets (SmartNFT)", "body": "Have you ever thought to have an NFT for your house? Maybe NFTs for your cars so you can sell your car using only NFTs, and not going to government for selling your cars. \n\nEvery day smart assets are being introduced to world using Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Houses are now smart, cars are smart, phones are smart, watches are smart, etc. These smart houses can do many things, like providing homeowners security, comfort, convenience and energy efficiency by allowing them to control smart devices, often by a smart home app on their smartphone or other networked device. Smart cars can do many things like “Communicating” Systems for Cars, System of 3D Gestures, Car Integration with Smartwatch, System for Automated Parking, Integration with different Apps, Full Integration with Phones. \n\nMost important point of them all is “owning”. Owning an asset like a phone or a house has many different aspects. In our “centralised” world owning an asset is having the rights by the government. Government gives you the rights to sell, rent, or even destroy your asset. But in the decentralised world, government is not there to give you rights. Rights of sell, rent, and destroy or other things in the decentralised world is given to you by owning that asset. Owning in this world means differently from the centralised world. Owning an asset is having the asset in your wallet address. \n\nIn the world of decentralisation, a virtual asset is an NFT that you own in your wallet. But what if you want to own your house or car as an NFT? ERC 721 or ERC 1155 that are described in [this article](https://mirror.xyz/0x2d209040c031d4e2D4d9cb4D3aabf18F52260AB0/YLdBJP9rIqzVc2vYH4LTC5rUwSdAst96F5IN8QhpWIw) cannot fulfil this action. They can not tie to real assets in the world. So another Ethereum standard is needed to tie NFTs to real assets. \n\nThis standard is the [ERC 4519](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4519) standard, or as the call it “SmartNFT”. A SmartNFT is tied to a physical asset that can check if the tie is authentic or not. The SmartNFT can include an Ethereum address of the physical asset and, consequently, the physical asset can sign messages or transactions. The physical asset can operate with an operating mode that is defined by its SmartNFT with an attribute named state. The token state can define if the token owner or the token user can use the asset or not. A cryptographically secure mutual authentication process can be carried out between the physical asset and its owner or its user. SmartNFTs extend [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) non-fungible tokens, which only allow representing assets by a unique identifier, but not by an Ethereum address. Moreover, SmartNFTs extend ERC 721 NFTs to include users in addition to owners.\n\nThis SmartNFT was developed because the ERC 721 NFT does not include the users of an asset (only include the owners) and does not include the Ethereum address of the asset. Smart assets (for example, IoT devices) are increasing nowadays. If smart assets are tied to SmartNFTs then they can be managed in a secure and traceable way. The reason is that SmartNFTs, unlike ERC 721 NFTs, allow establishing secure communication channels between the physical asset and its owner and its user. In this way, assets, owners and users can be assured of exchanging information with trusted parties.", "timestamp": 1658049827, "digest": "GPHJog_xO25ycAzjgGbTiApOZjyzc5UmDDUC4NaZUww", "contributor": "0x2d209040c031d4e2D4d9cb4D3aabf18F52260AB0"}

{"id": "tFB73lr_OQoMfUS8bVQHKTqD4HZjDob03UJUAAWH_Z4", "title": "Web3 Gaming, AKA Play-to-Earn, Blockchain or NFT Games: Here to revolutionise gaming in unique ways and bring power to the players! 🎮", "body": "Web3 gaming, the ***decentralised and player-ownership-driven*** evolution of traditional gaming, is at the forefront of the overall web3 or blockchain revolution that seems to be the inevitable future of the internet. And it has a long, exciting way to go.\n\n### What is Web3 gaming?\n\nWeb3 gaming offers an innovative approach for participating in games with the help of blockchain technology, and it is best understood in contrast to its traditional Web2 counterparts.\n\nTraditionally, Web2 games have been completely housed on a **single centralized server** owned by a single authority. This places several limitations on various in-game assets purchased by players with fiat currency (also earned collectibles).\n\n### Ownership of purchased and earned in-game assets\n\nThe first limitation in traditional games is related to the ownership of in-game assets that have been purchased with fiat currency. Do players really own the assets they just purchased? \n\nNo, the **copyright** for these in-game assets is still owned by the central authority, and players simply own a licence for interacting with these assets within the game ecosystem. That is not true ownership, and it is something Web3 gaming deals with innovatively by giving players ownership of their purchased and earned assets through NFTs. This brings us to the second limitation.\n\n### Trading limitations on purchased and earned in-game assets\n\nPurchased items and collectibles in traditional games hold value only within the game ecosystem and similarly can only be traded within the games closed market/ecosystem. \n\nWeb3 games first give players true ownership of assets through NFTs and secondly give players the freedom to trade the rewards earned in-game on other platforms, even the ability to trade these rewards for ***other cryptocurrencies*** or fiat currency. This enables players to earn money through in-game efforts, making Web3 games **play-to-earn.**\n\nThese are the two most obvious limitations that Web3 gaming gives players freedom from; true **ownership** of their in-game purchased and earned assets and the **freedom to trade these assets** across platforms and even earn money if they so wish.\n\n### Security of In-game Assets and Buyer Information\n\nOne of the most striking features of Web3 games is the decentralized nature of the entire process, removing the vulnerability of a single point of failure and making the servers much more secure than traditional games. \n\nThis safeguards not only in-game information and assets but also buyer information, arguably just as, if not more important.\n\n### Popular Web3 games out there today:\n\nIf you have heard of Web3 games, you must know the names **Aavegotchi, Axie Infinity and Alien Worlds.** Here are some of the most popular, innovative and rewarding games in the web3 space today. We’re also looking out for more innovative games so send us a suggestion if we’ve missed out someone!** \n **\n\n### Aavegotchi 👻\n\nIf user reviews and community engagement are anything to go by, then Aavegotchi is an extremely addictive and exciting on-chain digital petting game where players own **NFTs avatars (or pets)** staked with interest-generating tokens which can be used to interact with the Aavegotchi Metaverse (**called Gotchiverse)**. \n\nThese digital pets also accrue greater value over time owing to the interest-generating tokens which back them the longer a player owns them.\n\nThe digital pets are Aavegotchis, pixelated ghosts living on the Ethereum/Polygon blockchain. Players can interact with these Aavegotchis in various ways, such as dressing them with in-game “wearables” and petting them, increasing their value. \n\nAn Aavegotchi’s overall value is a combination of the amount of staked collateral and its rarity, determined by its in-game wearables and traits. \n\nThe value of an Aavegotchi will determine its performance in the rarity farming minigame where players can earn $GHST tokens, which can be traded on an exchange for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. \n\nThe recent soft launch of the Gotchiverse was also a massive success, with players able to use their Gotchis to **“farm”** in-game resources called KEK, ALPHA, FUD and FOMO from land parcels. These resources themselves are ERC-20 tokens which are freely tradable, and the parcels are NFTs, again full decentralized and tradable. Completely different from the Web2 game assets we are used to!\n\nThe next big farming phase starts on July 20th: \n\n[https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1547584198910758920?s=20&t=KIWWHLLdUTpJPrxJ6eWOUQ](https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1547584198910758920?s=20&t=KIWWHLLdUTpJPrxJ6eWOUQ)\n\nFor a more detailed description, please read the following article: \n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-play-aavegotchi-beginners-guide](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-play-aavegotchi-beginners-guide)\n\n### Axie Infinity \n\nIf one had to explain Axie infinity to a complete newbie, it would be described as Blockchain or Web3 Pokemon; that is a pretty accurate description. \n\nIn this game, players own NFTs of unique monsters and pit them against each other in battles. Players are rewarded **SLP (smooth love potion)** for performing PVE (Player vs Environment) activities and engaging in PVP (Player vs Player) content. \n\nWhile there is a daily cap on how much SLP can be earned through PVE activities, the amount of SLP that can be **earned (or lost)** through PVP activities is uncapped. SLP tokens are used in conjunction with $AXS tokens to breed new Axies and thus has value in the game. SLP can also be traded on exchanges for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency.\n\nTo learn more about Axie, please read the following article: \n\n[https://gamewith.net/axie-infinity/](https://gamewith.net/axie-infinity/)\n\n### Alienworlds.io\n\nAlien worlds is a mining/exploration-themed NFT-metaverse game on the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and WAX blockchains. Players compete to mine Trilium (TLM Tokens) and can own **land parcels on alien plants** (where they can mine for TLM or commission others to do so), avatars, weapons, minions and tools as NFTs to be used in-game. \n\nPlayers play as an explorer of the metaverse in the **year 2055**. Players explore the metaverse, mine for Trilium and fight wars using their minions. Players also have a chance to receive NFT item trading cards while mining. Besides mining for TLM, players can also use their TLM for staking and voting in Planet DAOs to increase the planet's reward pool.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n[https://goodvibesmining.com/aliens-worlds-guide/](https://goodvibesmining.com/aliens-worlds-guide/)\n\nIt is extremely important to note that the most noticeable common thread and condition for success between all the most successful games would be the brilliant and engaged communities they thrive on. \n\nGame designers have known for a long time that the lifeblood of a booming game ecosystem and economy is a vibrant, engaged and authentic game community that is having fun interacting with not just the game and its ecosystem but also interacting and trading among themselves. ** \n **\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n** \n **Even the most cursory look at the Web3 gaming space is enough to give anyone the impression that Web3 gaming is here to stay, to make waves and bring about great change in the gaming industry. \n\nWeb3 and Metaverse games are poised to bring more power to the players by giving them true ownership of the assets they purchase and the rewards they earn in-game. \n\nThe first major implication of this change is that players get to exchange their in-game assets and rewards on major exchanges for cryptocurrencies or fiat currency; this is sure to see massive adoption, especially as more Web3 games come out to dominate the gaming space. Builders are already gearing up for a massive ***P2E gaming revolution.***\n\nVideo games have always thrived in the presence of massive and vibrant communities, and Web3 gaming will be an even more powerful example of this phenomenon. At the end of the day, if your community is not engaged and having fun, they will not stick around.

"2011-03-18\n\n南通狼山五山拱北门，原内塑哼哈二将，上有五山拱北楼，门上有一竖一横两匾，竖匾为吴铃书“五山拱北”，横匾为张謇书“入山之门”。文革中，门被全部拆毁。\n\n民国十年（1921年），由著名学者费范九先生集资，在平潮镇北、通扬运河西岸，明代抗倭英雄曹顶战死处建曹公亭及曹顶横刀策马塑像，并立由费范九撰文、方训谋镌刻的碑文一块。文革中，亭像俱被捣毁。所幸碑记为附近群众保护下来，后由南通市博物馆收藏。今平潮镇“曹顶纪念园”中曹顶铜像及及镇北曹公亭均为后建。\n\n通州西亭镇南三里，唐代咸通年间所建的古刹西禅寺，于1958年“大跃进”中前殿、大殿均被拆除，仅剩后殿和厢房，改建为亭南小学。\n\n通州平潮镇通扬运河东岸（现平潮制鬃厂内），始建于清代雍正乾隆年间的古通明宫，有藏经室旧藏孔、老、佛、耶、回诸教典及九通二十四史、四部丛刊等共五万余卷，十年浩劫中被付之一炬。\n\n北宋大儒、著名学者、教育家、思想家胡瑗（安定先生）坟墓及墓门被毁，银杏树遭锯伐。胡公祠内胡公像也被毁。\n\n如皋古城东南角，初建于隋朝开皇十一年的定慧寺三公神位和定慧寺佛像同时被毁，寺内所藏文物悉被毁掠，和尚被赶出庙宇，佛像全被砸毁，殿堂建筑遭到严重破坏。\n\n如皋城东二十里东陈镇河西渡口，如皋冒姓始祖，元两淮盐运司丞冒致中墓，及子孙五世十茔附葬，被毁平。原墓后有罗城，墓前有墓门、墓道、墓碑。古柏百余棵。\n\n如皋城东南隅,始建于南唐保大十年的孔庙内大成门前面左右原有四座石碑，四个赑屃被毁.\n\n如皋城四百多年的老字号药店“实裕字号”和于右任写的竖牌同时被毁。\n\n如皋城西北隅，始建于建于北宋天禧年间的千年古刹海月寺佛像被毁，殿宇作为工厂。\n\n海门余东镇，明嘉靖武进士姜锦球故居，有二龙伴珠圣旨匾额，毁于“文革”之中。\n\n通州四甲镇境内，定海山、高山两座古庙被毁。\n\n狼山观音岩原有张謇造观世音像，文革中被毁。\n\n通州“平潮十景”之一的云台山，文革时被铲平，山上庙宇一并被毁。\n\n《江苏省志-文物志》\n\n“文化大革命期”间，省文管会工作陷于停顿状态，342处省级文物保护单位有51处彻底毁掉，如昆山的宋代妙峰塔、吴县明代敌楼和明代圣恩寺梵天阁等，均被拆除；常熟虞山汉至清代墓群90％被挖掉，其余的文物保护单位也都受到了不同程度的破坏。\n\n1966年的“文化大革命”，又发生了群众性的“破四旧”(旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗和旧习惯)运动，把文物、古籍图书和文物建筑等作为“四旧”而恣意破坏，造成了和平建设时期罕见的惨重损失。其间，全国重点文物保护单位苏州忠王府首先被取消，宜兴“会元状元”牌坊、**南通静业庵明代彩塑**、扬州史可法衣冠冢、苏州玄妙观三清殿塑像等5l处文物保护单位被完全拆毁.\n\n《江苏省志-文物志》\n\n**张謇墓**在南通市南郊的啬园，原称啬公墓。\n\n张謇，字季直，号啬庵，南通人。光绪二十年(1894)中甲午恩科状元，授翰林院修撰。次年，在南通创办大生纱厂。此后陆续开办通海垦牧公司、上海大达外江轮步公司、天生港轮步公司、广生油厂、资生铁冶厂等企业。自光绪二十八年(1902)起，张謇在本地还兴办了一些文化教育事业，他亲自创办通州师范、女子师范、盲哑学校、伶工学社、女工传习所、博物苑、南通图书馆、更俗剧场等，还创办了十多所职业学校，其中以纺织、农业、医校较有名，\n\n1920年这三个专科合并为南通大学。在外地，由张謇倡议或资助而设立的学校有吴淞商船学校、扬州两淮小学、中学及师范、南京高等师范、吴淞中国公学、上海复旦学院等。宣统三年(1911)，被学部任为中央教育会会长。宣统元年(1909)任江苏谘议局议长，成为国内立宪派领袖。辛亥革命后，表示“拥护”共和，任南京临时政府实业部总长o 1915年袁世凯推行帝制，张謇返乡，继续在南通地区搞实业、教育和“地方自治”o一生著有<张季子九录>、<张謇日记>、<啬公自订年谱>等著作o\n\n张謇于1926年逝世，终年74岁。其墓地啬园占地100亩，树木葱茏，河水清澈，环境幽雅。墓茔居墓园北部中心地位，东南方入口处为一座四合式院落的张氏享堂。1958年公墓改为南郊公园。1966年张謇墓茔遭受破坏，墓阙和张謇铜像亦被拆毁，1983年重建。\n\n**金应墓(附骆宾王墓和刘南庐墓)**\n\n金应墓在南通市南郊狼山东南麓，在一排三座石垒墓中的东首。\n\n金应字路分，江西吉水人。南宋德祜元年(1275)，元军大举进攻江南逼近临安，金应随文天祥起兵“勤王”为承信郎、东南第六正将。次年，文天祥出使元军请和，金应从行，俱被元军主将丞相伯颜拘留押解北去，途中金应和文天祥等乘元军不备，夜间逃出京口(今镇江)，沿途历尽艰难险阻，于德韦占二年(1276)闰三月十一日在通州病死，文天祥将其葬于西关外雪窖边，并赋《哭金路分应>诗二首焚其墓前以示哀悼，后来文天祥被俘在狱中犹集杜诗来怀念金应。为纪念金应，通州人民将其葬处的一条街巷取名为将军巷。\n\n南明永历十三年(1659)，金墓被大水冲刷，知州彭士圣得悉，乃命拣遗骨纳石函中，移葬于狼山现址。乾隆十二年(1747)，闽人刘南庐、郡人丁有煜修金应墓，并瓮石为台，缭以石垣，树立墓碑。石垣上镶《宋金应将军墓题记>。右旁的墓碑已裂为二段，碑面严重剥蚀，通高1．68米，宽0．41米，崇祯年间狼山镇副总兵王扬德撰文o“文化大革命”期间，此墓受破坏，1980年修复。该墓与“骆宾王墓”、“刘南庐墓”并列，在一个半圆形山窝中。石垒的断面，\n\n高1．59米，墓前立碑，嵌在石垒断面上。三墓均无墓穴，墓碑相距2米，并共树一牌坊，分三阙，上安石坊高3．14米，各宽1．89米，左坊书“宋金将军墓”，中书“骆宾王墓”，右书“闽处士南庐墓”。\n\n**沈寿墓**在南通市南郊马鞍山南麓。沈寿，初名云芝，后名寿，字雪君，苏州人，我国近代的刺绣艺术家，对“苏绣”的发展做出了重要贡献。沈寿墓座南朝北，依山傍水。“文化大革命”期间，墓被破坏，1981年依原式修复。\n\n**金沧江墓**在南通市狼山东南坡。\n\n金沧江，名泽荣，字子霖，沧江是其号，别名韶菠生，朝鲜开城府人。他是朝鲜历史学家和爱国诗人。\n\n金沧江42岁时中进士，曾任朝鲜史官、中枢院及内阁参书官、史礼部辅佐员、弘文馆纂辑所委员等职。1905年，日本帝国主义武装侵占朝鲜后，金沧江辞官弃职，携妻女及书箧，从仁川经上海到南通寓居。后受张謇委聘，担任南通翰林印书局编校。\n\n金沧江深通汉学，著作丰富，自编《韶薄堂集>、《沧江诗稿>、《朝国历代小史>等三十多种书，出版后大部分运回朝鲜，他辑印的朝鲜人《申紫霞诗集>，第一版1000部几乎全被本国购去。\n\n金沧江热爱祖国。1909年，朝鲜爱国青年安重根刺杀日本首相伊藤博文，他立即写了<安重根传)，印成万册散布，以表扬风烈。又曾给其幼子“命名光祖，望其光复祖国”。后来朝鲜爱国志士于上海组织朝鲜临时政府，金沧江写(拟陈情表>，以“为瓜为葛，为唇为齿”，比喻中朝关系。1927年4月，由于他复国的愿望不能实现，三个儿子早逝，而当时中国政局动荡，印书局停发工资，他的生活发生极大困难，遂在悲愤中服毒自杀。南通社会人士为他举行了隆重的追悼会，5月7日葬于狼山南坡。墓丘用水泥板镶制而成，长方形，正面宽I．95米，侧面长2．92米，墓丘高0．73米。\n\n其墓碑在“文化大革命”中被毁，迄未修复。\n\n《如皋市志》\n\n文物抢救、修缮 “文化大革命”初期，全县文物损毁、散失严重。1967年6月6日，县军管会 发出《关于在无产阶级文化大革命中保护文物、 图书的几点意见》，收效甚微。20世纪80年代始， 县政府组织抢救维修年久失修文物。1983年，县 政府组织修复“文化大革命”中遭浩劫的定慧寺， 分批修复楼、堂、殿、室，重塑佛像。1988年，县文 物管理部门组织修缮东北、西北 2 角下沉的文庙 大成殿，江苏省文管会下拨8万元专款，由南通市 文化局古建筑队耗时半年，进行抢救性矫形维修。\n\n戴联奎墓石刻 位于东陈镇尚书村。“文化大革命”期间被毁。改革开放后修复，御赐4尊石翁 仲、石马和墓门牌坊石刻均复归原位。2004 年 8 月29日，被南通市政府核准为南通市文物保护单 位。至2010年，保护完好。\n\n中山钟楼 民国 18 年（1929 年）6 月 1 日，为 纪念孙中山，由县教育局和县建设局共同投资兴 建，位于原县政府大院南大门内（古县城谯楼址， 今海阳路与中山路交汇处东北侧）。砖木结构，上下 5 层，阳台栏杆顶端距地面 16.22 米，东西长 5.36 米，南北宽 5.32 米，楼底门高 3.5 米。第四层 安有铜钟，钟面朝南，直径 1.525 米。1956 年 12 月，县人委重铸铜钟。 “文化大革命”中，铜钟被毁 坏，1981年修复。1991年12月30日，被市政府公 布为如皋市第一批文物保护单位。1995年，如城 旧城改造时被拆除。\n\n胡瑗墓 宋嘉祐四年（1059年），胡瑗殁后葬于浙江湖州乌程何山，其三子志正携其衣冠回故 里安葬，名“安定坟”，位于如城镇安定村。 “文化大革命”期间，被毁，仅存民国26年（1937年）洪友兰 书“宋大儒胡安定先生之墓”碑刻 1 方。1999 年， 胡安定研究会复建墓园，占地面积900平方米，墓 前立汉白玉质胡瑗全身雕像，冢封直径 3 米、高 1.5 米，后壁镌刻胡瑗名言“致天下之治者在人才 成天下之才者在教化 教化之所本者在学校”。园 内松柏苍翠，庄严肃穆。2004年5月8日，被市政 府公布为如皋市第二批文物保护单位。至 2010 年，保护完好。\n\n《南通县志》\n\n曹公亭 民族英雄余西人曹顶，明嘉靖三十六年四月追击倭寇至单家店(今平潮镇) 赍志桥激战中英勇阵亡。当时人于其死难处建曹公亭以资纪念。年久旧亭倾圮。民国10 年平潮费范九集资在原处重建。建国后，县人民政府拨款加以修葺。“文化大革命”时被毁。 1984年，平潮镇镇政府筹款再次重建，亭前悬费范九旧撰楹联：“遗像千秋，雄心直欲歼全 虏；危亭一间，毅魄犹应恋此乡。”1992年，又在新辟镇区广场中心树曹顶策马提刀凝目远 瞩铜像1尊，显示出梁启超昔日《题曹公亭》诗中“当年悲失淖，今日表康庄”的意境。\n\n沙淦墓沙淦系清末革命志士，光绪三十一年(1905年)在日本参加同盟会，次年归 国，潜居江北秘密从事革命活动。辛亥革命起义成功，即赴上海辅佐沪军都督陈其美。民 国2年，受命返通筹措讨伐袁世凯的军费，因其以往曾著《土皇帝》一书，触怒南通豪绅，竟 以“乱党”罪名将沙逮捕并拟置于死地。沙淦坚韧不屈，8月11日在城北王家坝慷慨就义，其父将其遗体偷回家乡李观音堂(今兴仁镇谢桥村)悄然安葬。北伐后，通人追怀沙淦，于 民国17年5月在狼山南麓建纪念亭，同时在李观音堂修沙淦墓，当时的南通县长为之亲 书墓表。沙淦墓在“文化大革命”中被平毁。1986年，兴仁镇政府出资重新修复，原来的墓表仍树立在旧处。\n\n静业庵座落于南通市北濠新村，俗称宝峰庄，现存建筑仅正殿一座，于明嘉靖八年（1529）重建。原有精美的五彩塑壁和雕木佛像在文革中被毁。该正殿为九脊单檐歇山式建筑，面阔三间，梁坊明代彩绘依稀可见。1983年被公布为南通市文物保护单位。现局部为南通风筝博物馆用房。\n\n近年来，因该文物建筑本体存在多个使用单位，且非博物馆用房区域存在一定的安全隐患。\n\n石庄汤氏宅\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FudYaS-VHf42B0gRCiN9uH.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n石庄汤氏宅位于如皋市石庄镇北大街

号。\n\n余东老街\n\n位于石板街北端的武进士故居，为明嘉靖年间武进士姜锦球所建，现存着两间明代居室，青砖黛瓦虽苍老班驳，但屋梁雕饰还显露着明朝遗风。\n\n南北走向的石板街是凤城当年的主街，往两边还伸出二十多条东西向的巷弄，其间也分布着程氏大门堂、张氏私塾、范式宅院、姐妹井等历史遗存。大门堂是通东民房外表的一种传统标志，大门堂的高低宽窄通常代表着这户人家门第的高低。余东曾有过108座大门堂，其中存60座悬挂过皇帝御赐的进士、贡生等匾额，可惜都在“文革”中被毁。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F83EeHlpDDgm717qlMTPMV.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n南通峨嵋山普贤寺位于南通市区西北约6公里处，唐闸镇东约2公里。\n\n本寺有记载的第一代僧人名圆音法师。1910年由净明师太接管，改为尼庵。后陆续增建，渐成规模。西侧南有古罗汉松，大殿后有直径2米多粗的古银杏树，高达四十多米（文革期间被砍）。1938年，日寇占领南通城，尼师们率领善男信女办念佛道场，幸免侵扰。1941年5月，突然天降冰雹，殿梁折断，后经周围群众共同努力，于当年6月20日举行落成典礼。1951年抗美援朝期间，大钟、大铜磬、大香炉全部献给国家，并在寺里开办民办小学。文革期间，大殿、佛像被毁，其余18间房屋统归学校。后来学校拆迁，留两间平房作生产队仓库，兼作牛棚，整个峨嵋山仅存一棵古罗汉松。1985年，附近居士将两间牛棚改成念佛堂兼老年助乐院。 1991年腊月初八，峨眉山被市里正式批准为佛教活动点。1992年，狼山广教寺监院定一法师受邀前来主持工作，正式恢复普贤禅寺，本来已经残枝败叶的罗汉松于第二年枯木逢春，枝叶茂盛。1993年4月，中国佛教协会会长赵朴初居士亲自题写“普贤禅寺”匾额。\n\n光绪末年，定惠寺山门外古城河的东岳庙被拆建为师范学堂，监院根源怕寺院房屋被占用，通过内阁总理大臣、庆亲王奕劻求慈禧太后帮忙照顾，然而慈禧老佛爷的父亲名叫惠征，太后觉得定惠寺也有个“惠”字，这就是缘分，所以下令保全寺庙，为避太后之父名讳，\"定惠寺\"更名为\"定慧寺\"，慈祥太后亲自御笔写下\"慧映中华\"匾额赐予定慧寺，这才保住了整个寺庙的周全。可惜慈禧太后亲笔所书的“慧映中华”匾额在文革中被毁，估计是劈成柴烧了。\n\n江苏：狼山朝圣地贺受封八十周年 成功修复狼山圣母像\n\n与上海隔长江相望的狼山是长江入海口最后一座山丘，素有“江海第一山”之称，历史上就是一座佛教名山，山顶的庙宇常年香火旺盛，对在地的南通乃至江苏中北 部地区影响深远。因1924年狼山圣母显圣于该山之巅，并洒玫瑰花雨于北麓一湖泊处，当地黄齐诗一家从而改奉圣教，并奉献土地，翌年教会才终于能在该地建 立一座小堂。此后，狼山名声逐渐在公教信友中传开，也由此开了朝圣。1929年，狼山圣母显圣给一朝圣农妇，名叫许江氏，她举债请上海朝圣信友从法国制作 一尊狼山圣母像，并于第二年问世，在圣母月中迎回本堂以观瞻礼，从此各地朝圣教胞日增月盛。狼山很快在1933年获得普世教会推崇，教宗庇护十一世颁布诏 书，敕封狼山为求赐圣教广扬之宗座朝圣地，并规定每年圣母月、玫瑰月及诸圣母瞻礼日赴狼山朝圣者可得全大赦特恩。狼山作为天主教的一处朝圣地，也是长江流 域北岸唯一的一处朝圣地，至此名扬海外、誉满远东。1951年，狼山圣母像获准加冕。文革中，狼山圣母像被毁。\n", "timestamp": 1658050458, "digest":

His split tongue wiggling in fury trying to sense something.\n\nAs he went further down our exchange, his Jacobson’s organ started to give him a strange tickling sensation.  \n What the hell is going on here.  \n That Macbook screen doesn’t radiate any heat, it’s as cold as the broken heart of the enslaved child who assembled it.\n\nHe got worried, unable to quit looking at the screen, the sensation getting stronger and stronger, overwhelming.  \n Having read all of it, he was completely disoriented. He got on the phone with the best herpetologists right away (yes rich man power right there).\n\nBy eleven, a meeting was arranged with the world top scientists. Zuck was at peak paranoia.  \n “They talked about hacking brains!!! Did they go through my firewall?!”  \n His new daily affirmation for calm and serenity wasn’t working out for him, and his profuse sweating had nothing to do with his new Swedish sauna.\n\nQuickly after, the experts gave their conclusion.  \n That warmth he senses with that good old vomeronasal receptor of his.  \n That’s wholesomeness.\n\nA quick check of the definition later Zuck was sitting on his ass. His legs weren’t able to support him at this point. He was having a melt down and a revelation at the same time.  \n After contemplating the boulder he got polished by hand to look like a pebble in his garden’s fountain, he realised he needed to do something about it.\n\nHis almighty MacBook on his lap, he got to work.  \n Three hours later, the heart animation was ready.

Thus matter is “radiation”.\n\n1\\.1.1: Everything that can be perceived by the human bodily senses directly or with the aid of material tools is material radiation.\n\n1\\.1.2: Matter has no inherent life i.e. it has no inherent will, motive, or consciousness.\n\n**1.2.** The material universe is a derivative of the non-material universe.\n\n1\\.2.1: A derivative always expresses an element of the nature of the source.\n\n    1.2.1.1: Material radiations/particles reflect elements of pre-existing non-material radiations.\n\n1\\.2.2: Consciousness is a property of non-materiality. It is not a property of matter.\n\n    1.2.2.1: There exist higher (more complex) and lower (simpler) states of non-material radiation. Thus there are higher and lower states of consciousness.\n\n    1.2.2.2: The urge to achieve a higher state of consciousness is inherent in the nature of non-material substance.\n\n1\\.2.3: The non-material can give rise to both non-materiality and materiality. Materiality can only give rise to materiality.\n\n**1.3**: Under specific conditions, it is possible for non-materiality to amalgamate with matter, thus forming a single continuum.\n\n1\\.3.1: The amalgamation of the non-material with materiality gives rise to “life” in the material world.\n\n**1.4:** Man is a non-material species - a “spirit”.\n\n1\\.4.1: The spirit possesses consciousness and has an inherent urge to achieve greater consciousness.  \n\n1\\.4.2: Man on earth is a spirit temporarily amalgamated with matter in the form of a physical body.\n\n      1.4.2.1: The amalgamation of the spirit and the body gives the material body a form of consciousness.\n\n          1.4.2.1.1: Physical man can be said to have two consciousnesses: the permanent spiritual consciousness that is inherent in his spirituality and a temporal pseudo-consciousness (“mental” or “brain” consciousness) that arises from the spirit’s connection to the body.\n\n**1.5:** Man’s thoughts, words, and actions result from the interaction of his consciousnesses, and further influence these consciousnesses.\n\n1\\.5.1: Man’s spirit can make decisions.\n\n      1.5.1.1: Decisions of the spirit (“will”, “volition”) are non-material.\n\n      1.5.1.2: A decision of the spirit can give rise to non-materiality and materiality (1.2.3).\n\n          1.5.1.2.1: The spiritual decision always has spiritual effects. It may or may not result in an observable material effect depending on the degree of spirit→brain→body \"alignment\".\n\n          1.5.1.2.2: A spiritual will/volition can stimulate the brain’s thinking process (1.2.3).\n\n      1.5.1.3: Man's spirit can perceive non-material influences. These can affect his spiritual decisions.\n\n      1.5.1.4: Greater spiritual consciousness is achieved by the continuous experiencing resulting from aligning material actions with spiritual will.    \n\n1\\.5.2: Man’s brain can form thoughts.

{"id": "JUfSdVMZbeB3llQE6ETwHPxK35l8LcxLHCMwwc6H0mk", "title": "Освобождение народов", "body": "*Концепция плана обретения национальной независимости государством, народ которого доказал свою зрелость для этого по всем критериям, обычно применяемым при определении термина «нация» в энциклопедических источниках и по беспрецедентности понесенных потерь и испытаний на пути к этому. Успешная реализация данного проекта по степени уникальности может стать не только первым в мире прецедентом выхода на мировую арену народа, находившегося в сложнейших условиях военно-политического, гуманитарного и экономического характера, но и шаблоном для начала эпохи образования государств нового типа на месте феодальных систем.*\n\n*В нашем случае реализация такого Проекта поставит точку в вопросе о соответствии Чеченского народа реалиям современного мира и уровню национального сознания общества развитых стран. Учитывая ненасильственный характер предлагаемого объединения в сообщество Свободного Государства и осмысленного участия населения в жизни сообщества и его экономического пространства, наше государство своим примером может дать импульс началу ускоренного развития стран третьего мира.*\n\nПрименение методологии такого Проекта в глобальном масштабе позволит избежать нежелательной тенденции массовой миграции населения развивающегося мира в более успешные регионы мира, лишающей возможности развития в отсталых регионах позитивного сценария социально-экономической эволюции.\n\nПредлагаемое нами является вариантом поэтапного, но стремительного плана создания современного общественно-экономического пространства на месте авторитарных режимов, с учетом сегодняшних трендов общественного и технологического развития. Уверенность в успехе поставленной перед собой амбициозной задачи представителями легитимной власти Чеченской Республики Ичкерия обусловлена пониманием истинных базисных психологических драйверов развития человеческого общества, активация которых неизбежно приведет к быстрому переходу на более высокий релевантный уровень самосознания народа и органичному естественному встраиванию его общественно-экономических институтов в разряд развитых и адекватных текущему уровню стран - представителей передовой человеческой цивилизации.\n\nПроект содержит в себе действенный рецепт для преодоления последствий эпохи системного развала авторитарных режимов, так как негативные процессы социального характера неизбежно сопровождают разрушение существующих институтов в условиях тотальной дезориентации населения, не имеющего представления о форме социально-экономического устройства в качестве конечной цели, как это было в ряде стран Ближнего Востока, Африки, Восточной Европы и Азии.\n\n**Формулировка проблемы**\n\nЗа всю историю человеческого общества переломные моменты смены общественных формаций неизменно сопровождались экономической катастрофой и многочисленными жертвами. Это происходит только потому, что участниками процесса (а в такие времена участниками являются сотни тысяч, если не миллионы) движет лишь абстрактная идея, тогда как отчетливая картина целевой общественной системы и ее функционал остаются вне общественного сознания людей. У многочисленных масс нет представления о том, какие институты необходимо создать и каким образом эти институты будут функционировать. Это происходит раз за разом во всех странах переходного периода развития по той причине, что у населения этих стран нет самостоятельного опыта взаимодействия с новыми институтами в каком-либо обозримом прошлом – приходилось «изобретать велосипед» снова и снова, пока после многочисленных попыток не удавалось, наконец, выработать компромиссную систему общественно-экономических институтов, удовлетворяющую все слои социума.\n\nПосле глубокого анализа механизма, движущего обществом на уровне психологии и интуиции, свойственных человеческой природе, нами был выработан универсальный алгоритм для подготовки массового сознания населения развивающегося мира к самостоятельной реализации необходимых изменений. Настоящим Проектом мы намерены реализовать этот алгоритм в нашем частном случае и встать в общем ряду развитых народов современной цивилизации. Однако, будучи в условиях оккупации и тяжелейшей социально-экономической ситуации, мы не имеем необходимого минимума ресурсов для его реализации.\n\nПоэтому мы разработали гораздо менее затратный план освобождения, как в части человеческих жертв, материальных средств, так и времени, необходимого для построения свободного общества. Тогда как в традиционных сценариях, наблюдаемых по всему миру в странах с незрелыми гуманитарными и общественными институтами, цена свободы драматически высока.\n\n*Мы надеемся на то, что Проект получит должную оценку и станет шаблоном последовательных мероприятий и в других странах развивающегося мира, которые гарантированно приведут их народы к ментальному пробуждению и построению свободного общества.*\n\nПеред непосредственным изложением этапов Проекта считаем необходимым познакомить Вас с нашим определением основных понятий, аргументацией и обоснованием логики Проекта.\n\n**ИДЕЯ ПРОЕКТА. ОСНОВНЫЕ ПОНЯТИЯ И РАБОТА НАД ОШИБКАМИ**\n\n**Дефиниция понятия свободы**\n\nПри рождении каждый человек обладает, в той или иной степени, первичным и единственно доступным набором активов: Здоровьем, Временем, Интеллектом. Это те врожденные средства производства, что в последствии, благодаря или вопреки обстоятельствам, каждый из нас с момента рождения использует в течение последующей жизни для обретения или создания «классических» материальных активов. За право владения землей, ресурсами, продуктами производства идет конкурентная борьба в течение последующей жизни, но базовые и самые ценные «первичные» активы, будучи атрибутами живых разумных существ незаслуженно обходятся вниманием. Тогда как свободное распоряжение именно *первичными* ресурсами является признаком личной свободы и свободы общества в целом. Первичные врожденные активы являются базовыми атрибутами свободы и должны быть отнесены к такой же категории частной собственности, как и традиционные активы, поскольку именно они на самом деле являются самыми ценными и важными средствами производства и также подвержены риску присвоения с помощью насилия, обмана или манипуляций общественным сознанием.\n\nВвиду «врожденности» первичных активов, ценность их не осознается человеком подобно ситуации с воздухом. *(Мы не замечаем ценности воздуха, поскольку он присутствует по умолчанию, и наш организм «бесплатно» получает самый ценный продукт для поддержания жизни).* Присвоение природных способностей человека, продуктов его ума, труда и времени посредством пропаганды, принуждения и легитимизации их отъема номенклатурами государств старого мира (царем, рабовладельцем, бюрократией) вело к истощению жизненных сил, потере человеческого достоинства, что становилось со временем привычным для общества и формировало ущербные принципы Общественного Договора под влиянием «вековых устоев».\n\nИспользуемые в процессе производства национального продукта труд, время, интеллект, здоровье каждого из нас являются такими же экономическими категориями и средствами производства, которые человек обменивает на рынке на жизненно необходимые средства существования.\n\nМы должны отметить для себя и *наглядно* показать людям, что общественная система, которая лишает человека полной или частичной возможности использовать в своих собственных интересах эти личные ресурсы, а также явно или косвенно присваивает создаваемое им в течение жизни имущество, все это в совокупности –есть нарушение его прав, даже если человек отдает эти ресурсы добровольно, в обмен на гарантированное довольствие или обещания «светлого будущего».\n\nСтрела эволюции общественных систем, ее вектор обусловлены единственной движущей силой – не сколько и не только борьбой за материальные ресурсы, сколько за свободу в части *самостоятельного* их использования для создания новых ценностей в своих интересах. Именно эта самостоятельность определяет экономическую и технологическую эволюцию человеческого общества. В этом же заключается движущий массами скрытый и неосязаемый с первого взгляда, революционный мотив. «Народное счастье» и безликая справедливость без точной формулировки и без четкой дефиниции этих понятий – не более, чем лозунги. У каждого человека есть свое представление о самом себе, о своих возможностях, поэтому в каждом частном случае интуитивным желанием каждого человека является не сам предмет мечты и вожделения (машина, дом, айфон), а *среда, которая обеспечивает свободу для реализации этой мечты.* Это есть то, что объединяет массы в революционный период и движет ими в ходе исторического развития. Однако на протяжении веков, добиваясь уступок в виде увеличения довольствия в том или ином виде со стороны рабовладельческой, феодальной или социалистической власти, общество на время удовлетворялось частично достигнутым улучшением, притупляя «основной инстинкт», отличающий человека от животного мира. В ходе эволюции, рос уровень сознания человека, и в определенные моменты общество вновь начинало понимать, что ему не хватает необходимой степени свободы для реализации своих возможностей. И борьба продолжалась. *Примерно такой логике на самом деле подчиняется процесс общественного развития.*\n\n*Мы должны уяснить, что «врожденные» ресурсы: время, физическое здоровье, интеллект и свобода их применения для достижения наших собственных целей являются гораздо более ценными активами, нежели золото, уголь, нефть, земля и т.д. Любые материальные активы могут быть использованы человеком лишь благодаря свободе распоряжаться самим собой и всеми «первичными» ресурсами, которые получает каждый человек с первой секунды своего появления на свет. Свобода именно в такой интерпретации является на самом деле ценностью, за которую человек веками ведет классовую борьбу.*\n\nСледует отметить, что нагромождение общественных наук и исследовательских работ на тему социологии должным образом не учитывали такой ракурс рассмотрения истории и смысла, вокруг которого развивалось и продолжает развиваться человеческое общество.\n\n**[Здесь](https://mirror.xyz/0x92a825909dcC69591618209ABa8Df71f1F06A91e/A3LWezMkaiuqyaM_L18i8ipO4bfGCIzb9OkKvFSm4vA)** приведена логика, в ключе которой мы понимаем природу свободы и потенциал энергии, которую она в себе несет в случае ее полной реализации.\n\n**Причины неудачи предыдущих попыток создания государства**\n\nВНУТРЕННИЕ И ВНЕШНИЕ ФАКТОРЫ, ПОМЕШАВШИЕ СОЗДАНИЮ ПОЛНОЦЕННОГО ГОСУДАРСТВА В ПЕРИОД 1991-1994гг И ПОСЛЕ ПОДПИСАНИЯ МИРНОГО ДОГОВОРА С РОССИЕЙ В 1997г\n\nНеобходимо быть достаточно честными и признать: несмотря на то, что мы справились с задачей защиты политической независимости, полученной с соблюдением всех норм Международного права в 1991 году и одержав историческую победу над агрессором, будучи малым народом в 1996 году, мы так и не успели сформировать полноценное собственное государство. Врагу удалось с помощью террора, подкупа части нашего общества и искусственной дискредитации молодого государства в глазах мировой общественности вновь оккупировать территорию Чеченской Республики Ичкерия (ЧРИ).\n\nОсновной причиной произошедшего после победы над оккупантом ценой сотен тысяч жертв, мы считаем как раз отсутствие у населения нашего государства опыта жизни в условиях благоприятной нормальной системы и даже представления о ней, несмотря на обостренное интуитивное стремление к ней.\n\nПомимо активного противодействия со стороны Москвы, отсутствия национальной валюты и построенных на рыночных принципах хозяйственных связей, у населения ЧРИ не было опыта жизни в рыночной деловой среде для быстрого восстановления в постсоветский (1991-1994гг) и послевоенный (1996-1999гг) периоды для преодоления последствий войны и начала формирования национальной экономики из локальных частных предприятий среднего и малого бизнеса.\n\nНаши люди, будучи такими же «гражданами» неестественной общественной системы государства, сложившейся при СССР, никогда не видели иной конструкции и способов добычи средств существования, нежели та, что была предложена империей. Это лишило несколько поколений нашего народа возможности применения лучших конкурентных качеств, предпринимательской предрасположенности народа, имеющего все шансы быть гармонично встроенным в качестве равноправного и полноценного субъекта международного права и мировой экономики.\n\nПлюс к этому, *мы были лишены всяческой помощи со стороны развитого мира в результате предпринятых Москвой ряда мер дискредитирующего характера по отношению к нашей борьбе.*\n\nТочно так же, как Россия (и ее сателлиты СНГ) не в состоянии в одночасье стать страной с современной экономикой и нормальными институтами типа права на жизнь и здоровье, свободы слова, частной собственности и т.д., ни одно тоталитарное или авторитарное государство не сможет получить желаемого эффекта от учреждения современных институтов, скопированных у развитых стран без ментального принятия населением всего этого набора ценностей. Ничего не получится без понимания того, как должны функционировать и взаимодействовать общественные и государственные институты, обеспечивающие наиболее эффективный механизм всего общественно-экономического организма государства, основанного объединенными единой волей свободными гражданами.\n\nИмея в руках самый простой и действенный козырь – деньги, оккупационная власть дала «мирную» и условно «сытую» альтернативу избранной номенклатуре коллаборационистов, а измученному войной народу долгожданную передышку и сносное существование в рамках феодальной системы метрополии. Тогда как Свобода в умах наших соотечественниках, пусть и взлелеянная веками мечта, не была подкреплена, ни реальным опытом жизни в свободной общественно-экономической системе, ни даже представлением о ней с точки зрения работы институтов государства со свободной рыночной экономикой. Мы не успели построить современное государство свободного типа, чтобы люди могли противопоставить его предложенной в обмен на мир модели отсталого, но пока еще сильного и коварного врага.\n\n*Считаем важным подчеркнуть, что концепция Проекта национального масштаба предполагает бескровное освобождение сознания народа от феодального мировоззрения с последующим построением свободного государства незаметно для существующей номенклатуры. Успешная последовательная реализация всех этапов Проекта позволит избежать последствий распада метрополии и дезориентации населения республики. Более того, подобный проект может стать шаблоном для самостоятельного освобождения народов не только бывшего СССР, но и других народов развивающегося мира.*\n\n**Факторы, сопутствующие успеху Проекта**\n\nСЛОЖИВШИЕСЯ ОБСТОЯТЕЛЬСТВА И МЕНТАЛЬНОСТЬ НАСЕЛЕНИЯ ЧРИ, ПОЗВОЛЯЮЩИЕ РАССЧИТЫВАТЬ НА УСПЕШНУЮ РЕАЛИЗАЦИЮ ПРОЕКТА:\n\n1). Удачным для нашего народа обстоятельством является то, что в вайнахском обществе сохранилась популярность достойных качеств. Этим качествам придается настолько важное место в жизни общества, что они сгруппированы в емкие понятия, имеющие собственные названия: в части ответственности в делах перед обществом и готовности прийти на помощь (понятие «ГIилакх»), уважение друг к другу (понятие «Эздел»), высшая форма конкуренции во всех делах (понятие «Яхь»), нормы поведения в быту и обществе и т.д. – все это наилучшим образом сохранено и остается популярным. Перечисленные нормы и качества естественным образом отобразятся на результаты Проекта, так как попадут в благодатную почву, где их соблюдение ВЫГОДНО.\n\nНевежественные в прошлом, но развитые сегодня народы выработали в себе деловую этику, уважение к труду, эмпатическое понимание проблем друг друга, способность конкурировать и т.д., когда наконец поняли, что риск от их несоблюдения стал выше, чем потенциальная доходность от насилия или мошенничества. А соблюдение всех этих правил общежития в условиях свободы и равенства – единственно возможный характер взаимоотношений в плане взаимной безопасности, возможности привлечения партнеров, роста репутации и богатства.\n\nНаше конкурентное преимущество, которое даст свои плоды прямо сейчас, даже на стадии формирования собственного государства – наличие этих необходимых национальных и культурных особенностей, которое сегодня еще является признанным в нашем обществе *национальным богатством*.\n\n2). *Частная Собственность* является культом в нашем обществе, сохранившимся до сих пор. А то, что она является тем институтом, что позволил западным странам опередить остальной мир, признается неоспоримым фактом во всем развитом мире. Это не связано с генетическими особенностями каких-либо народов. Получение в конечном итоге прав и свобод большинством населения западного полушария раньше других обусловлено тем, что институт частной собственности присутствовал в западной цивилизации со времен Римской Империи и был закреплен не только за привилегированными сословиями, но и за простыми гражданами империи, даже на завоеванных территориях, хотя и в ограниченном объеме. Это обстоятельство стало решающим в дальнейшем опережающем развитии западной цивилизации, в отличие от остального мира, где население было таким же объектом собственности, как любое имущество. Рабовладение присутствовало везде, но в Римской Империи был еще и институт «свободных граждан», имевших право собственности на базовый набор материального имущества, самостоятельное использование которого - единственный способ добычи средств физического существования или выживания.\n\nПодробное изучение общественного механизма, работа которого позволила странам Запада опередить остальной мир в данном случае не является важным знанием. Гораздо важнее *понимание* самой его основы и передача этого знания населению. Тогда, при наличии такого понимания, создание эффективной общественно-экономической системы само по себе и по умолчанию будет проходить с учетом необходимых преобразований и оптимизации механизма экономики для придания ей свободного и рыночного характера. Каждому обывателю на ментальном уровне важно донести понимание невозможности полноценного существования человека без свободы распоряжаться самим собой, его собственным материальным имуществом и индивидуальными способностями, как средствами производства, в своих личных интересах, (наподобие того, как сложно представить себе улитку без ее домика).\n\nВ нашем случае стремление получить экономическую свободу не смогла истребить даже царская Россия и мощная пропаганда в СССР, в рамках системы которого мы находились длительное время. Отсюда массовые «вылазки» представителей нашего народа во времена существования СССР в отдаленные регионы страны «за длинным рублем» с ненормированным, тяжелым, но добровольным приложением физического труда с риском лишения свободы в условиях тоталитарного государства, где частная собственность была под строгим запретом. В контексте наших рассуждений – это были массовые попытки получения наибольшего экономического эффекта от использования своих собственных личных ресурсов: физических способностей, времени и интеллекта, вопреки правилам враждебной среды, в которой мы находились.\n\nУникальность нашего случая в том, что вайнахское общество вынуждено было выработать в себе и сохранить ряд важных, необходимых нам сейчас конкурентных качеств в условиях постоянной угрозы уничтожения и критически минимального материального ресурса для выживания.\n\nПоэтому мы стали такими, какими являемся на стыке 20 и 21 века. Когда доблесть и чувство конкуренции во всех аспектах жизни общества культивируется веками и с детства, оно более мобилизовано и способно совершить резкий скачок в развитии, если найдет в себе силы создать государство и сформировать современную нацию в полном смысле этого понятия.\n\nПредставляем Вашему вниманию непосредственный План практической реализации Проекта создания свободного экономического пространства для нашего народа путем погружения его в естественную среду делового и имущественного взаимодействия между всеми гражданами с предоставлением для этого всей необходимой технологической инфраструктуры.\n\n**ПРОЕКТ**\n\nУниверсальный план освобождения и возникновения гражданского общества содержит два этапа:\n\n***Первый этап*** являет собой подготовку массового сознания к переменам путем *наглядной художественной, легко усвояемой демонстрации* работы института *частной собственности* в условиях свободы с учетом местного менталитета и исторических особенностей.\n\n***Второй этап*** предусматривает практическое предоставление необходимой технологической общественной и финансово-экономической инфраструктуры для обеспечения функционального аппарата рыночной экономики с полноценными и работающими экономическими институтами.\n\nТо есть для начала необходимо показать: как именно выглядит личная, политическая и экономическая свобода, а затем подготовленному массовому сознанию предоставить необходимую инфраструктуру в качестве каркаса для будущих институтов.\n\n<crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers>", "timestamp": 1658053577, "digest": "lZEYGC9xFfzds2Ss31Vs1yC5vFppjt28BjpWVFbsQ3I", "contributor": "0x92a825909dcC69591618209ABa8Df71f1F06A91e"}

All reality is of two types: the material (“matter” / “physical universe” / “space-time continuum”) and  the non-material (“ethereal” / “spiritual”).***\n\n**1.1**: The elementary subatomic particles that comprise matter exhibit wavelike behaviour. Thus matter is “radiation”.\n\n1\\.1.1: Everything that can be perceived by the human bodily senses directly or with the aid of material tools is material radiation.\n\n1\\.1.2: Matter has no inherent life i.e. it has no inherent will, motive, or consciousness.\n\n**1.2.** The material universe is a derivative of the non-material universe.\n\n1\\.2.1: A derivative always expresses an element of the nature of the source.\n\n    1.2.1.1: Material radiations/particles reflect elements of pre-existing non-material radiations.\n\n1\\.2.2: Consciousness is a property of non-materiality. It is not a property of matter.\n\n    1.2.2.1: There exist higher (more complex) and lower (simpler) states of non-material radiation. Thus there are higher and lower states of consciousness.\n\n    1.2.2.2: The urge to achieve a higher state of consciousness is inherent in the nature of non-material substance.\n\n1\\.2.3: The non-material can give rise to both non-materiality and materiality. Materiality can only give rise to materiality.\n\n**1.3**: Under specific conditions, it is possible for non-materiality to amalgamate with matter, thus forming a single continuum.\n\n1\\.3.1: The amalgamation of the non-material with materiality gives rise to “life” in the material world.\n\n**1.4:** Man is a non-material species - a “spirit”.\n\n1\\.4.1: The spirit possesses consciousness and has an inherent urge to achieve greater consciousness.  \n\n1\\.4.2: Man on earth is a spirit temporarily amalgamated with matter in the form of a physical body.\n\n      1.4.2.1: The amalgamation of the spirit and the body gives the material body a form of consciousness.\n\n          1.4.2.1.1: Physical man can be said to have two consciousnesses: the permanent spiritual consciousness that is inherent in his spirituality and a temporal pseudo-consciousness (“mental” or “brain” consciousness) that arises from the spirit’s connection to the body.\n\n**1.5:** Man’s thoughts, words, and actions result from the interaction of his consciousnesses, and further influence these consciousnesses.\n\n1\\.5.1: Man’s spirit can make decisions.\n\n      1.5.1.1: Decisions of the spirit (“will”, “volition”) are non-material.\n\n      1.5.1.2: A decision of the spirit can give rise to non-materiality and materiality (1.2.3).\n\n          1.5.1.2.1: The spiritual decision always has spiritual effects. It may or may not result in an observable material effect depending on the degree of spirit→brain→body \"alignment\".\n\n          1.5.1.2.2: A spiritual will/volition can stimulate the brain’s thinking process (1.2.3).\n\n      1.5.1.3: Man's spirit can perceive non-material influences. These can affect his spiritual decisions.\n\n      1.5.1.4: Greater spiritual consciousness is achieved by the continuous experiencing resulting from aligning material actions with spiritual will.    \n\n1\\.5.2: Man’s brain can form thoughts.

The brain will only notice such influences if they accord with the *nature of the spirit* i.e. the main direction of its general will-ing.\n\n            1.5.2.3.2: Thoughts may be stimulated by non-material influences perceived through the spirit.\n\n1\\.5.3: Spiritual consciousness/maturity is not correlated with mental consciousness/maturity.", "timestamp": 1658053982, "digest": "lWLDNvn0l8vWd4TcvOPal65dD9JBJMb7HSAuUQUjaSc", "contributor": "0x40cC95F5056EE6e3e6449A78A2a2Efa2d29d22f9"}

なかなか仕組みとか入り口が分かりにくい（自分もそうでした）と思うので、もっといろんな人が興味を持ったらいいなという思いで紹介をしてみようと思います。記事の内容はNFAであり売買をするときはDYORでよろしくお願いします\n\n言いたいことがいっぱいあるのですごい長くなる予感がしますが、それでは始めてみます\n\n# Art Blocksとは\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8bUcwFzTtqlZOglaPFar.png?height=217&width=811)\n\nArt Blocksとはなにかについてまずは[公式のサイト](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)にある創業者のSnowfro（Chromie Squiggleの作者）の言葉で始めてみます\n\n> Art Blocksは、イーサリアム・ブロックチェーン上に不変に保存される、プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツに焦点を当てた、これまでにないタイプのプラットフォームです。\n>\n> 好きなコレクションを選び、作品の代金を支払うと、アルゴリズムによってランダムに生成されたバージョンのコンテンツが作成され、あなたのイーサリアムアカウントに送られます。出来上がった作品は、静止画像であったり、3Dモデルであったり、インタラクティブな体験であったりします。出力はそれぞれ異なり、プラットフォーム上で作成できるコンテンツの種類には無限の可能性があります。\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/learn](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)\n\nアーティストはコレクションを生み出すコードを登録し、購入者がサイトからmintをするとトランザクションごとに、コードに組み込まれたランダムな要素が組み合わさって一定の共通のスタイルであるけれどもそれぞれが異なる作品を生み出すプラットフォームがArt Blocksです。すでに存在している作品から選ぶのではなくmintに参加することでコレクターが作品を生み出す体験ができることが魅力の1つだと思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートに興味がない、NFT ARTに興味がない人でもArt Blocksのことはなんとなく聞いたことがある（からこの記事を読んでいると思いますが）人はそれなりにいると思います。それはArt BlocksがすでにNFTの1つのジャンルを代表するブランドになっているからだと思います。\n\n今後NFTの世界がより広がり多くの新しい人たちが入ってきたときにもアートの入り口として存在しているなら、人々をひきつける作品を継続的に生み出すプラットフォームとしてNFTの世界でのアートのカテゴリでのブランドであり続けているかもしれないと思います。\n\nArt Blocksの魅力、可能性についてZenecaが熱く語っている記事が2つ、またCoincheck NFTでArt Blocksを購入できるので、Coincheckの紹介記事も分かりやすいのでので合わせてどうぞ\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks)\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2)\n\n[https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494](https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494)\n\n# ジェネラティブアートとは\n\nArt Blocksの紹介の中に出てきた「プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツ」＝**ジェネラティブアート**にそもそもなんで高い値段がつくのか分からない、という人も多いと思います（自分もそうでした）\n\nジェネラティブアートがなにかについては入門記事として必ず名前が出る「ジェネラティブアートを愛する理由」という記事が素晴らしいので、Art Blocksに興味があれば時間のある時にぜひ読んでみてほしいです。\n\n[https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/](https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/)\n\nいくつか自分が記事を読んでなるほどなー、と思ってジェネラティブアートは良いぞ！と思うに至ったポイントなどを引用を交えつつ簡単にまとめてみます。\n\n### ジェネラティブ・アートは20世紀美術の中心的テーマの拡張\n\n> 幾何学的、抽象化、偶然性は、ジェネラティブ・アートに限らず、20世紀のあらゆるアートにとって主要なテーマです。以下のような主題がこれらはコンピューターを使っていない20世紀初頭の作品から強く感じることが出来て、ジェネラティブアートとつながっていることを強く感じることが出来ます。\n\n* 分析的キュビスムにおける幾何学の破壊\n* 未来派、構成主義、バウハウスにはじまるテクノロジー重視、マシン美学、機械化された生産\n* ダダ、シュルレアリスム、抽象表現主義における自律と偶然の導入\n* 新造形主義、シュプレマティスム、ハード・エッジ、オプ・アートの非比喩的美学、力強い幾何学、鮮明な色使い\n* ソル・ルウィットらによるアルゴリズムの使用\n\n![左から、Circles in a Circle – Wassily Kandinsky, 1923、Highway and Byways – Paul Klee, 1928、Suprematist Composition – Kasimir Malevich, 1916　今のジェネラティブアートに通じるものを強く感じます](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQJNTIr4szr7UXa0L-yvQ.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\n> ジェネラティブアートは\n>\n> **「ジェネラティブアートとは、コンピュータを使い、創造のプロセスの一部に意図的に偶然性を取り入れたプログラムで作られたアートのことである。」**\n>\n> と定義されますが、2つの間違った見方をよくされることがあります。\n\n> ### よくある誤解・その1\n>\n> アーティストは創作のプロセス全体を完全に制御していて、プログラムは常に書かれた通りに実行されるだけである。それゆえジェネラティブアートは、たとえ人間的で親しみやすいものだったとしても、偶然性、偶発性、発見性、自発性を欠いている。\n>\n> ### よくある誤解・その2\n>\n> アーティストはまったく制御することなく、自律的なマシンがランダムにデザインを生成しているだけである。コンピュータがアートを作っていて、人間は制作者には値しない。本当のアートとはいえないのだから。\n\n実際にはジェネラティブアートは作品を生み出すための偶然性を作者であるアーティストが丁寧にコントロールしています。私は秩序の中の偶然性、と聞くと人の手が入らないあらゆる自然の中にあるものを思い浮かべます。受け取り方は人それぞれだと思いますがジェネラティブアートを見ていて時々はっとした気持ちになって心を奪われるのはそういう側面もあるのかな、と思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートは現代のアートの一つの形であり、NFT、Cryptoの外の世界にも存在するものなので、NFT外のアートに関心がある人たちにとっては特殊なものではなく受け入れやすいアートの形式なのかもしれません。\n\n# Art Blocksの仕組み\n\nだいぶ話が飛躍しましたがArt Blocksの紹介に戻ります。\n\n![左からFidenza、Ringers、Archetype](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TdQfBj9BkM47n1SZ5VVYq.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\nArt Blocksは”Curated”、”Factory”、”Playground”という３つのカテゴリーに分かれています。\n\n### Curated\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?section=curated](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?section=curated)\n\n* Art Blocksの審査を経てリリースされる作品。月に1つぐらいのペースでmintされる\n* Chromie Squiggle、Fidenza、Ringers、など有名でフロアが高い作品はCuretedのものが多い\n* ダッチオークションのスタート価格も高い\n\n### Factory\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab)\n\n* Curatedにはまだ申請をしていない or 受理されていないアーティストたちの作品\n* 自由度が高いので作品の見た目のバリエーションも豊富\n\n### Playground\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab)\n\n* Curatedに選ばれたことがあるアーティストが実験的であったり、自由度の高い作品を出すことが出来る場\n* 実績のあるアーティストの作品になるのでフロアが高くなることもある\n\nフロアを市場の評価とするならばCuratedが最も人気が出やすいです。\n\n### 販売方法\n\n* Art Blocksの作品はダッチオークションで販売されることが多いです\n  * Factoryの作品には固定のmint価格のものも時々あります\n* 作品の人気や市場の状況によりますが、評価が定まっていない状態で販売されることも多いので結果的に、セカンダリに対して割安な価格でmintできることがあります\n* リリースが予定されている作品はArt Blocksの公式サイトの”upcoming project releases”やDiscrodで紹介されているので定期的に見てお気に入りのプロジェクトがあったらmintの日程をカレンダーに登録すると良いと思います\n  * mintは日本時間の深夜（AM2時ぐらいとか）が多いです\n\n👇はArt Blocks公式のYouTubeチャンネルにあるHow to Mintの動画です\n\n[https://youtu.be/wczbsScyEdo](https://youtu.be/wczbsScyEdo)\n\n# なにから始めたらいいのか\n\n### セカンダリ（OpenSeaなど）で購入する\n\nすでにmintが終わった作品はOpenSeaで販売されているので、いろんな作品を見てその中からお気に入りの作品が見つかって購入してもよい、と思えたらセカンダリで購入するところから始めても良いと思います\n\n* [Art Blocks Curated](https://opensea.io/collection/art-blocks?collectionSlug=art-blocks&search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&search%5Btoggles%5D%5B0%5D=BUY_NOW)\n* [Art Blocks Playground](https://opensea.io/collection/art-blocks-playground?collectionSlug=art-blocks-playground&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5Btoggles%5D%5B0%5D=BUY_NOW)\n* [Art

mintに参加する\n\n公式サイトなどからmint予定の作品を定期的にチェックしてお気に入りのコレクションがあったらぜひmintに参加してみてください。ダッチオークションを見守りながら自分の作品がmintして生み出された作品が届くときはとても楽しい体験です！\n\nまた、まだmintが終わっていないコレクションもいくつか公式サイトで紹介されています。(“projects open to mint”となっています)その中から気になる作品があればmintしてみるのもいいかもしれません\n\n# おわりに\n\n長々と書いてきたのでここまで読んでくれている人がどれだけいるか分かりませんが最後に\n\n自分が購入した作品の価値が上がってフロアが上がるのが一番嬉しいし、そういう側面は大いにあるので「儲ける」ためにArt Blocksを購入することもぜんぜんありだと思いますが、Art Blocksはいわゆる「NFT ART」に属するので盛り上がっている時期はそれなりに取引がありますが、PFPなど他のジャンルが盛り上がっている時期には、多くの人の関心が無くなってほとんど取引が無くなるようなこともあります。なので短期（1か月以内）で利益を出すことを目的とするのには向いていないのでそこは気を付けてください。\n\nなによりも自分が気に入っていつまでも持っていたいと思える作品に出会ったらそれを購入して、多くの人にその作品とジェネラティブアートとArt Blocksの楽しさや良さを伝えていけるような良い出会いがあるのが一番だと思います。（👇は自分が持っていてお気に入りのHōrō）\n\n[https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096](https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096)\n\nブロックチェーンを通じてコードによって生み出されてNFTになる、という仕組みは多くのその他のカテゴリの中でもかなりNFT、ブロックチェーンをがっつり活用した仕組みだと思っています。自分はいつの間にかジェネラティブアートが大好きになってしまったので、これからも機会を見て作品を増やしたいな、と思っているのでした。",

Blocksとはなにかについてまずは[公式のサイト](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)にある創業者のSnowfro（Chromie Squiggleの作者）の言葉で始めてみます\n\n> Art Blocksは、イーサリアム・ブロックチェーン上に不変に保存される、プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツに焦点を当てた、これまでにないタイプのプラットフォームです。\n>\n> 好きなコレクションを選び、作品の代金を支払うと、アルゴリズムによってランダムに生成されたバージョンのコンテンツが作成され、あなたのイーサリアムアカウントに送られます。出来上がった作品は、静止画像であったり、3Dモデルであったり、インタラクティブな体験であったりします。出力はそれぞれ異なり、プラットフォーム上で作成できるコンテンツの種類には無限の可能性があります。\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/learn](https://www.artblocks.io/learn)\n\nアーティストはコレクションを生み出すコードを登録し、購入者がサイトからmintをするとトランザクションごとに、コードに組み込まれたランダムな要素が組み合わさって一定の共通のスタイルであるけれどもそれぞれが異なる作品を生み出すプラットフォームがArt Blocksです。すでに存在している作品から選ぶのではなくmintに参加することでコレクターが作品を生み出す体験ができることが魅力の1つだと思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートに興味がない、NFT ARTに興味がない人でもArt Blocksのことはなんとなく聞いたことがある（からこの記事を読んでいると思いますが）人はそれなりにいると思います。それはArt BlocksがすでにNFTの1つのジャンルを代表するブランドになっているからだと思います。\n\n今後NFTの世界がより広がり多くの新しい人たちが入ってきたときにもアートの入り口として存在しているなら、人々をひきつける作品を継続的に生み出すプラットフォームとしてNFTの世界でのアートのカテゴリでのブランドであり続けているかもしれないと思います。\n\nArt Blocksの魅力、可能性についてZenecaが熱く語っている記事が2つ、またCoincheck NFTでArt Blocksを購入できるので、Coincheckの紹介記事も分かりやすいのでので合わせてどうぞ\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-10-art-blocks)\n\n[https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-19-art-blocks-2)\n\n[https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494](https://coincheck.com/ja/article/494)\n\n# ジェネラティブアートとは\n\nArt Blocksの紹介の中に出てきた「プログラムによって生み出されるジェネレーティブコンテンツ」＝**ジェネラティブアート**にそもそもなんで高い値段がつくのか分からない、という人も多いと思います（自分もそうでした）\n\nジェネラティブアートがなにかについては入門記事として必ず名前が出る「ジェネラティブアートを愛する理由」という記事が素晴らしいので、Art Blocksに興味があれば時間のある時にぜひ読んでみてほしいです。\n\n[https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/](https://lab.sugimototatsuo.com/2018/09/why-love-generative-art/)\n\nいくつか自分が記事を読んでなるほどなー、と思ってジェネラティブアートは良いぞ！と思うに至ったポイントなどを引用を交えつつ簡単にまとめてみます。\n\n### ジェネラティブ・アートは20世紀美術の中心的テーマの拡張\n\n> 幾何学的、抽象化、偶然性は、ジェネラティブ・アートに限らず、20世紀のあらゆるアートにとって主要なテーマです。以下のような主題がこれらはコンピューターを使っていない20世紀初頭の作品から強く感じることが出来て、ジェネラティブアートとつながっていることを強く感じることが出来ます。\n\n* 分析的キュビスムにおける幾何学の破壊\n* 未来派、構成主義、バウハウスにはじまるテクノロジー重視、マシン美学、機械化された生産\n* ダダ、シュルレアリスム、抽象表現主義における自律と偶然の導入\n* 新造形主義、シュプレマティスム、ハード・エッジ、オプ・アートの非比喩的美学、力強い幾何学、鮮明な色使い\n* ソル・ルウィットらによるアルゴリズムの使用\n\n![左から、Circles in a Circle – Wassily Kandinsky, 1923、Highway and Byways – Paul Klee, 1928、Suprematist Composition – Kasimir Malevich, 1916　今のジェネラティブアートに通じるものを強く感じます](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQJNTIr4szr7UXa0L-yvQ.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\n> ジェネラティブアートは\n>\n> **「ジェネラティブアートとは、コンピュータを使い、創造のプロセスの一部に意図的に偶然性を取り入れたプログラムで作られたアートのことである。」**\n>\n> と定義されますが、2つの間違った見方をよくされることがあります。\n\n> ### よくある誤解・その1\n>\n> アーティストは創作のプロセス全体を完全に制御していて、プログラムは常に書かれた通りに実行されるだけである。それゆえジェネラティブアートは、たとえ人間的で親しみやすいものだったとしても、偶然性、偶発性、発見性、自発性を欠いている。\n>\n> ### よくある誤解・その2\n>\n> アーティストはまったく制御することなく、自律的なマシンがランダムにデザインを生成しているだけである。コンピュータがアートを作っていて、人間は制作者には値しない。本当のアートとはいえないのだから。\n\n実際にはジェネラティブアートは作品を生み出すための偶然性を作者であるアーティストが丁寧にコントロールしています。私は秩序の中の偶然性、と聞くと人の手が入らないあらゆる自然の中にあるものを思い浮かべます。受け取り方は人それぞれだと思いますがジェネラティブアートを見ていて時々はっとした気持ちになって心を奪われるのはそういう側面もあるのかな、と思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートは現代のアートの一つの形であり、NFT、Cryptoの外の世界にも存在するものなので、NFT外のアートに関心がある人たちにとっては特殊なものではなく受け入れやすいアートの形式なのかもしれません。\n\n# Art Blocksの仕組み\n\nだいぶ話が飛躍しましたがArt Blocksの紹介に戻ります。\n\n![左からFidenza、Ringers、Archetype](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TdQfBj9BkM47n1SZ5VVYq.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\nArt Blocksは”Curated”、”Factory”、”Playground”という３つのカテゴリーに分かれています。\n\n### Curated\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?section=curated](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?section=curated)\n\n* Art Blocksの審査を経てリリースされる作品。月に1つぐらいのペースでmintされる\n* Chromie Squiggle、Fidenza、Ringers、など有名でフロアが高い作品はCuretedのものが多い\n* ダッチオークションのスタート価格も高い\n\n### Factory\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab)\n\n* Curatedにはまだ申請をしていない or 受理されていないアーティストたちの作品\n* 自由度が高いので作品の見た目のバリエーションも豊富\n\n### Playground\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab)\n\n* Curatedに選ばれたことがあるアーティストが実験的であったり、自由度の高い作品を出すことが出来る場\n* 実績のあるアーティストの作品になるのでフロアが高くなることもある\n\nフロアを市場の評価とするならばCuratedが最も人気が出やすいです。\n\n### 販売方法\n\n* Art Blocksの作品はダッチオークションで販売されることが多いです\n  * Factoryの作品には固定のmint価格のものも時々あります\n* 作品の人気や市場の状況によりますが、評価が定まっていない状態で販売されることも多いので結果的に、セカンダリに対して割安な価格でmintできることがあります\n* リリースが予定されている作品はArt Blocksの公式サイトの”upcoming project releases”やDiscrodで紹介されているので定期的に見てお気に入りのプロジェクトがあったらmintの日程をカレンダーに登録すると良いと思います\n  * mintは日本時間の深夜（AM2時ぐらいとか）が多いです\n\n👇はArt Blocks公式のYouTubeチャンネルにあるHow to Mintの動画です\n\n[https://youtu.be/wczbsScyEdo](https://youtu.be/wczbsScyEdo)\n\n# なにから始めたらいいのか\n\n### セカンダリ（OpenSeaなど）で購入する\n\nすでにmintが終わった作品はOpenSeaで販売されているので、いろんな作品を見てその中からお気に入りの作品が見つかって購入してもよい、と思えたらセカンダリで購入するところから始めても良いと思います\n\n* [Art Blocks Curated](https://opensea.io/collection/art-blocks?collectionSlug=art-blocks&search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&search%5Btoggles%5D%5B0%5D=BUY_NOW)\n* [Art Blocks Playground](https://opensea.io/collection/art-blocks-playground?collectionSlug=art-blocks-playground&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5Btoggles%5D%5B0%5D=BUY_NOW)\n* [Art

mintに参加する\n\n公式サイトなどからmint予定の作品を定期的にチェックしてお気に入りのコレクションがあったらぜひmintに参加してみてください。ダッチオークションを見守りながら自分の作品がmintして生み出された作品が届くときはとても楽しい体験です！\n\nまた、まだmintが終わっていないコレクションもいくつか公式サイトで紹介されています。(“projects open to mint”となっています)その中から気になる作品があればmintしてみるのもいいかもしれません\n\n# おわりに\n\n長々と書いてきたのでここまで読んでくれている人がどれだけいるか分かりませんが最後に\n\n自分が購入した作品の価値が上がってフロアが上がるのが一番嬉しいし、そういう側面は大いにあるので「儲ける」ためにArt Blocksを購入することもぜんぜんありだと思いますが、Art Blocksはいわゆる「NFT ART」に属するので盛り上がっている時期はそれなりに取引がありますが、PFPなど他のジャンルが盛り上がっている時期には、多くの人の関心が無くなってほとんど取引が無くなるようなこともあります。なので短期（1か月以内）で利益を出すことを目的とするのには向いていないのでそこは気を付けてください。\n\nなによりも自分が気に入っていつまでも持っていたいと思える作品に出会ったらそれを購入して、多くの人にその作品とジェネラティブアートとArt Blocksの楽しさや良さを伝えていけるような良い出会いがあるのが一番だと思います。（👇は自分が持っていてお気に入りのHōrō）\n\n[https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096](https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096)\n\nブロックチェーンを通じてコードによって生み出されてNFTになる、という仕組みは多くのその他のカテゴリの中でもかなりNFT、ブロックチェーンをがっつり活用した仕組みだと思っています。自分はいつの間にかジェネラティブアートが大好きになってしまったので、これからも機会を見て作品を増やしたいな、と思っているのでした。",

**「ジェネラティブアートとは、コンピュータを使い、創造のプロセスの一部に意図的に偶然性を取り入れたプログラムで作られたアートのことである。」**\n>\n> と定義されますが、2つの間違った見方をよくされることがあります。\n\n> ### よくある誤解・その1\n>\n> アーティストは創作のプロセス全体を完全に制御していて、プログラムは常に書かれた通りに実行されるだけである。それゆえジェネラティブアートは、たとえ人間的で親しみやすいものだったとしても、偶然性、偶発性、発見性、自発性を欠いている。\n>\n> ### よくある誤解・その2\n>\n> アーティストはまったく制御することなく、自律的なマシンがランダムにデザインを生成しているだけである。コンピュータがアートを作っていて、人間は制作者には値しない。本当のアートとはいえないのだから。\n\n実際にはジェネラティブアートは作品を生み出すための偶然性を作者であるアーティストが丁寧にコントロールしています。私は秩序の中の偶然性、と聞くと人の手が入らないあらゆる自然の中にあるものを思い浮かべます。受け取り方は人それぞれだと思いますがジェネラティブアートを見ていて時々はっとした気持ちになって心を奪われるのはそういう側面もあるのかな、と思っています。\n\nジェネラティブアートは現代のアートの一つの形であり、NFT、Cryptoの外の世界にも存在するものなので、NFT外のアートに関心がある人たちにとっては特殊なものではなく受け入れやすいアートの形式なのかもしれません。\n\n# Art Blocksの仕組み\n\nだいぶ話が飛躍しましたがArt Blocksの紹介に戻ります。\n\n![左からFidenza、Ringers、Archetype](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TdQfBj9BkM47n1SZ5VVYq.png?height=547&width=1410)\n\nArt Blocksは”Curated”、”Factory”、”Playground”という３つのカテゴリーに分かれています。\n\n### Curated\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?section=curated](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?section=curated)\n\n* Art Blocksの審査を経てリリースされる作品。月に1つぐらいのペースでmintされる\n* Chromie Squiggle、Fidenza、Ringers、など有名でフロアが高い作品はCuretedのものが多い\n* ダッチオークションのスタート価格も高い\n\n### Factory\n\n[https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab](https://www.artblocks.io/projects?filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bfactory%5D=true&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bplayground%5D=false&filter%5Bcollection%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcurated%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Btype%5D=enum&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bopen%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bpaused%5D=false&filter%5Bstatus%5D%5Boptions%5D%5Bcomplete%5D=false&section=all_ab)\n\n*

Curatedに選ばれたことがあるアーティストが実験的であったり、自由度の高い作品を出すことが出来る場\n* 実績のあるアーティストの作品になるのでフロアが高くなることもある\n\nフロアを市場の評価とするならばCuratedが最も人気が出やすいです。\n\n### 販売方法\n\n* Art Blocksの作品はダッチオークションで販売されることが多いです\n  * Factoryの作品には固定のmint価格のものも時々あります\n* 作品の人気や市場の状況によりますが、評価が定まっていない状態で販売されることも多いので結果的に、セカンダリに対して割安な価格でmintできることがあります\n* リリースが予定されている作品はArt Blocksの公式サイトの”upcoming project releases”やDiscrodで紹介されているので定期的に見てお気に入りのプロジェクトがあったらmintの日程をカレンダーに登録すると良いと思います\n  * mintは日本時間の深夜（AM2時ぐらいとか）が多いです\n\n👇はArt Blocks公式のYouTubeチャンネルにあるHow to Mintの動画です\n\n[https://youtu.be/wczbsScyEdo](https://youtu.be/wczbsScyEdo)\n\n# なにから始めたらいいのか\n\n### セカンダリ（OpenSeaなど）で購入する\n\nすでにmintが終わった作品はOpenSeaで販売されているので、いろんな作品を見てその中からお気に入りの作品が見つかって購入してもよい、と思えたらセカンダリで購入するところから始めても良いと思います\n\n* [Art Blocks Curated](https://opensea.io/collection/art-blocks?collectionSlug=art-blocks&search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&search%5Btoggles%5D%5B0%5D=BUY_NOW)\n* [Art Blocks

mintに参加する\n\n公式サイトなどからmint予定の作品を定期的にチェックしてお気に入りのコレクションがあったらぜひmintに参加してみてください。ダッチオークションを見守りながら自分の作品がmintして生み出された作品が届くときはとても楽しい体験です！\n\nまた、まだmintが終わっていないコレクションもいくつか公式サイトで紹介されています。(“projects open to mint”となっています)その中から気になる作品があればmintしてみるのもいいかもしれません\n\n# おわりに\n\n長々と書いてきたのでここまで読んでくれている人がどれだけいるか分かりませんが最後に\n\n自分が購入した作品の価値が上がってフロアが上がるのが一番嬉しいし、そういう側面は大いにあるので「儲ける」ためにArt Blocksを購入することもぜんぜんありだと思いますが、Art Blocksはいわゆる「NFT ART」に属するので盛り上がっている時期はそれなりに取引がありますが、PFPなど他のジャンルが盛り上がっている時期には、多くの人の関心が無くなってほとんど取引が無くなるようなこともあります。なので短期（1か月以内）で利益を出すことを目的とするのには向いていないのでそこは気を付けてください。\n\nなによりも自分が気に入っていつまでも持っていたいと思える作品に出会ったらそれを購入して、多くの人にその作品とジェネラティブアートとArt Blocksの楽しさや良さを伝えていけるような良い出会いがあるのが一番だと思います。（👇は自分が持っていてお気に入りのHōrō）\n\n[https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096](https://deca.art/token/0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270/301000096)\n\nブロックチェーンを通じてコードによって生み出されてNFTになる、という仕組みは多くのその他のカテゴリの中でもかなりNFT、ブロックチェーンをがっつり活用した仕組みだと思っています。自分はいつの間にかジェネラティブアートが大好きになってしまったので、これからも機会を見て作品を増やしたいな、と思っているのでした。",

Врагу удалось с помощью террора, подкупа части нашего общества и искусственной дискредитации молодого государства в глазах мировой общественности вновь оккупировать территорию Чеченской Республики Ичкерия (ЧРИ).\n\nОдной из основных причин произошедшего после победы над оккупантом ценой сотен тысяч жертв, мы считаем как раз отсутствие у населения нашего государства опыта жизни в условиях благоприятной нормальной системы и даже представления о ней, несмотря на обостренное интуитивное стремление к ней.\n\nПомимо активного противодействия со стороны Москвы, отсутствия национальной валюты и построенных на рыночных принципах хозяйственных связей, у населения ЧРИ не было опыта жизни в рыночной деловой среде для быстрого восстановления в постсоветский (1991-1994гг) и послевоенный (1996-1999гг) периоды для преодоления последствий войны и начала формирования национальной экономики из локальных частных предприятий среднего и малого бизнеса.\n\nНаши люди, будучи такими же «гражданами» неестественной общественной системы государства, сложившейся при СССР, никогда не видели иной конструкции и способов добычи средств существования, нежели та, что была предложена империей. Это лишило несколько поколений нашего народа возможности применения лучших конкурентных качеств, предпринимательской предрасположенности народа, имеющего все шансы быть гармонично встроенным в качестве равноправного и полноценного субъекта международного права и мировой экономики.\n\nПлюс к этому, *мы были лишены всяческой помощи со стороны развитого мира в результате предпринятых Москвой ряда мер дискредитирующего характера по отношению к нашей борьбе.*\n\nТочно так же, как Россия (и ее бывшие сателлиты СНГ) не в состоянии в одночасье стать страной с современной экономикой и нормальными институтами типа права на жизнь и здоровье, свободы слова, частной собственности и т.д., ни одно тоталитарное или авторитарное государство не сможет получить желаемого эффекта от учреждения современных институтов, скопированных у развитых стран без ментального принятия населением всего этого набора ценностей.

However, if the personal health information is stored privately on the blockchain, women and doctors can continue to use health monitoring applications as individuals are protected by the fifth amendment to not self-incriminate.\n\n \n\n**By creating tool to store information with absolute privacy, MBMC aims to achieve following objectives:**\n\n \n\n·      *Preemptive prevention of  unwanted pregnancies*\n\n·      *Monitor personal health during the ovulation cycle*\n\n·      *Allow private health information storage on a secure database*\n\n·      *Protect women seeking abortion  across state and country borders*\n\n·      *Prevent legal action against doctors and hospitals  for treating patients*\n\n \n\n*“MBMC aims to assist in creating the greatest generation of daughters, mothers and sisters that the world has ever seen”*\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n**2.  Who am I going to give money to?**\n\n \n\n \n\n**1. Treasury:**\n\n·      MBMC will run as a foundation. The foundation’s solemn mandate is ensuring absolute privacy meaning no individual or group of individuals can access private user data unless allowed by the user.\n\n \n\n**2 Software developers.**\n\n·      MBMC needs at least a front-end and one back-end developer with solidity experience to build a decentralized MVP application or ZK-snark on Ethereum.  From a front-end perspective, most work involves copying functionalities of existing centralized health applications. From a back-end perspective, the main coding difference is that information is encrypted and stored on Ethereum rather than on a centralized database . The user interface and absolute security must be superior to that of existing women’s health applications.\n\n \n\n \n\n·      **Back-end person will help develop the following:**\n\no   What program to use\n\no   How we build the app\n\no   Code design\n\n \n\n·      **Front-end person will help develop following:**\n\no   UI\n\no   Functionalities\n\no   Landing site\n\n \n\n**Lawyer:**\n\n·      This person must have experience with health care laws. I think that certain law firms will be able to work on this pro-bono.\n\no   The app will connect abortion clinics with individuals using web3\n\n§  There will be lots of legal troubles\n\no   Explore the issues related to privacy and pleading the fifth\n\n§  If no third-party company owns the information, but the government hacks the phone and figures out the password. Is the acquired information legally binding in court given that I plead the fifth property?\n\no   Understand contract negotiation\n\n \n\n**Marketing Person:**\n\n·      We will hire a social media savvy salesperson. Hopefully we can find someone with experience in both social media and health care. He/She must be highly passionate about this idea and able to use all forms of social media including web 3\n\n \n\n**Advisors:**\n\n·      We will at least have one senior advisor with experience in start-ups. This individual will hopefully have an extensive business network and be willing to teach a group of young motivated professionals on how to run a company.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n**3.  How does it work?**\n\n \n\n**User experience:**\n\n \n\n*Step 1: Download and activate the app.*\n\n·      Create an encrypted web3 name\n\no   ( we have partnered with ENS to create a free naming creation)\n\no   Set up a password and private key with absolute privacy\n\n·      Provide user information to activate the account\n\no   User information is encrypted and no email, age or other information is necessary to minimize security problems\n\n \n\n*Step 2: Use the app to monitor health.*\n\n·      Like any other health app, users provide health information on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or ad-hoc basis to monitor personal health\n\n \n\n*Step 3: Unwanted health complications.*\n\n·      If unwanted health complications occur, the application will send a warning.\n\n·      The app may then provide a vast network of hospitals and doctors offering necessary treatment\n\n·      Users can rely on the app for secure communication with doctors and hospitals to set up in-person treatment without legal consequences\n\n \n\n**Back End:**\n\n*Step 1:  Data about the individuals are privately stored and can only be accessed by the user that provided the information*\n\n·      The data is encrypted on the blockchain\n\n·      The data can only be viewed by user\n\n \n\n*Step 2: Connect new information, store and verify data on the blockchain*\n\n·      When a user enters in new information, that information is bundled, shuffled and encrypted to be securely stored on the blockchain, which is done similar to normal health apps\n\n \n\n*Step 3: Connect to hospital and doctor*\n\n·      If health complication arise the user can connect through a safe messaging service with a doctor.\n\n·      Doctors and hospitals can use the application for secure communication and prescription provision.\n\n \n\n \n\n**4) Where does this company belong?**\n\nThe marketplace for this type of product has a download fee of 1 dollar and a monthly subscription price. We are looking at providing this product for tickets at around 10 dollars a year. The product is aimed at consumers, above all else women,  valuing personal health and privacy in geographic locations for which freedom and liberties are threatened. If bitcoin was the first principle method to secure a decentralized database and Ethereum creates an application layer, MBMC is created to generate blockchain adoption by yielding a tool for individuals to monitor their health privately.\n\n \n\nThe U.S. market is highly attractive at the moment due to the recent supreme court ruling to interfere with a woman’s right to make decisions about their own bodies. Estimated amounts spent on abortion in the U.S. is around USD 60 billion per year depending on whom you ask. In the future we aim to expand in other countries that limit freedoms and liberties.\n\n \n\nThe main focus will be placed on southern states in the US. That is because the south is a religious Mecca. Religious people infringe their view on others and are not afraid to leverage the law to accomplish their wants and needs. Given that people care what other people do with their bodies in southern states, one can use blockchain to shield private health information from curious people and governments that should care more about their own life.\n\n \n\nIn the future, MBMC aims to provide services to other markets as well. MBMC will be a key tool for maintaining private health information and other  private information private by shielding the information from outside influence using encryption ultimately protecting all user information with the fifth amendment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n**5) Why has this idea not been done?**\n\nThere are multiple potential reasons for why a non-linear pricing system for tickets to sporting events has not been created. I have listed them below.\n\n \n\n**Reason 1:**\n\n·      This company is a cross-section between blockchain and the health industry.\n\n**Reason 2:**\n\n·      Private health information is under threat like never before in history\n\n·      Third-party ownership of private information through the user’s internet dependency can be used to launch unfair criminal investigations\n\n**Reason 3:**\n\n·      Blockchain has not been adopted yet because there has never been a strong enough why\n\n·      A Woman’s right to choose is a strong why and when there exists a why there is always a how.  MBMC is the how.\n\n**Reason 4:**\n\n·      The law environment is becoming more conservative although the US is becoming more liberal. The app aims to democratize access to private health and allow people to make decisions in regards to their own bodies.", "timestamp": 1658055965, "digest": "jHGjHz4Znw_KS3GiRHOAbQI5s2kZmgaIy5LLRFZNjfo", "contributor": "0x85CF93ACaA379e14fd8850F9a74Bf282b9a5b593"}

Врагу удалось с помощью террора, подкупа части нашего общества и искусственной дискредитации молодого государства в глазах мировой общественности вновь оккупировать территорию Чеченской Республики Ичкерия (ЧРИ).\n\nОдной из основных причин произошедшего после победы над оккупантом ценой сотен тысяч жертв, мы считаем как раз отсутствие у населения нашего государства опыта жизни в условиях благоприятной нормальной системы и даже представления о ней, несмотря на обостренное интуитивное стремление к ней.\n\nПомимо активного противодействия со стороны Москвы, отсутствия национальной валюты и построенных на рыночных принципах хозяйственных связей, у населения ЧРИ не было опыта жизни в рыночной деловой среде для быстрого восстановления в постсоветский (1991-1994гг) и послевоенный (1996-1999гг) периоды для преодоления последствий войны и начала формирования национальной экономики из локальных частных предприятий среднего и малого бизнеса.\n\nНаши люди, будучи такими же «гражданами» неестественной общественной системы государства, сложившейся при СССР, никогда не видели иной конструкции и способов добычи средств существования, нежели та, что была предложена империей. Это лишило несколько поколений нашего народа возможности применения лучших конкурентных качеств, предпринимательской предрасположенности народа, имеющего все шансы быть гармонично встроенным в качестве равноправного и полноценного субъекта международного права и мировой экономики.\n\nПлюс к этому, *мы были лишены всяческой помощи со стороны развитого мира в результате предпринятых Москвой ряда мер дискредитирующего характера по отношению к нашей борьбе.*\n\nТочно так же, как Россия (и ее бывшие сателлиты СНГ) не в состоянии в одночасье стать страной с современной экономикой и нормальными институтами типа права на жизнь и здоровье, свободы слова, частной собственности и т.д., ни одно тоталитарное или авторитарное государство не сможет получить желаемого эффекта от учреждения современных институтов, скопированных у развитых стран без ментального принятия населением всего этого набора ценностей. Ничего не получится без понимания того, как должны функционировать и взаимодействовать общественные и государственные институты, обеспечивающие наиболее эффективный механизм всего общественно-экономического организма государства, основанного объединенными единой волей свободными гражданами.\n\nИмея в руках самый простой и действенный козырь – деньги, оккупационная власть дала «мирную» и условно «сытую» альтернативу избранной номенклатуре коллаборационистов, а измученному войной народу долгожданную передышку и сносное существование в рамках феодальной системы метрополии.

Удачным для нашего народа обстоятельством является то, что в вайнахском обществе сохранилась популярность достойных качеств. Этим качествам придается настолько важное место в жизни общества с незапамятных времен, что они сгруппированы в емкие понятия, имеющие собственные, непереводимые на другие языки названия: в части ответственности в делах перед обществом и готовности прийти на помощь (понятие «ГIилакх»), уважение друг к другу (понятие «Эздел»), высшая форма конкуренции во всех делах (понятие «Яхь»), нормы поведения в быту и обществе и т.д. – все это наилучшим образом сохранено и остается популярным. Перечисленные нормы и качества естественным образом попадут в благодатную почву, где их соблюдение ВЫГОДНО, в случае реализации проекта.\n\nНевежественные в прошлом, но развитые сегодня народы выработали в себе деловую этику, уважение к труду, эмпатическое понимание проблем друг друга, способность конкурировать и т.д., когда наконец поняли, что риск от их несоблюдения стал выше, чем потенциальная доходность от насилия или мошенничества. А соблюдение всех этих правил общежития в условиях свободы и равенства – единственно возможный характер взаимоотношений в плане взаимной безопасности, возможности привлечения партнеров, роста репутации и богатства.\n\nНаше конкурентное преимущество, которое даст свои плоды прямо сейчас, даже на стадии формирования собственного государства – наличие этих необходимых национальных и культурных особенностей, которое сегодня еще является признанным в нашем обществе *национальным богатством*.\n\n2). *Частная Собственность* является культом в нашем обществе, сохранившимся до сих пор. А то, что она является тем институтом, что позволил западным странам опередить остальной мир, признается неоспоримым фактом во всем развитом мире. Это не связано с генетическими особенностями каких-либо народов. Получение в конечном итоге прав и свобод большинством населения западного полушария раньше других обусловлено тем, что институт частной собственности присутствовал в западной цивилизации со времен Римской Империи и был закреплен не только за привилегированными сословиями, но и за простыми гражданами империи, даже на завоеванных территориях, хотя и в ограниченном объеме. Это обстоятельство стало решающим в дальнейшем опережающем развитии западной цивилизации, в отличие от остального мира, где население было таким же объектом собственности, как любое имущество. Рабовладение присутствовало везде, но в Римской Империи был еще и институт «свободных граждан», имевших право собственности на базовый набор материального имущества, самостоятельное использование которого - единственный способ добычи средств физического существования или выживания.\n\nПодробное изучение общественного механизма, работа которого позволила странам Запада опередить остальной мир в данном случае не является важным знанием. Гораздо важнее ***понимание самого общественного мотива его работы и передача этого знания населению***. Тогда, при наличии такого понимания, создание эффективной общественно-экономической системы само по себе и по будет проходить осознанно с учетом необходимых преобразований и оптимизации механизма экономики для придания ей свободного и рыночного характера. Каждому обывателю на ментальном уровне важно донести понимание невозможности полноценного существования человека без свободы распоряжаться самим собой, его собственным материальным имуществом и индивидуальными способностями, как средствами производства, в своих личных интересах, (наподобие того, как сложно представить себе улитку без ее домика).\n\nВ нашем случае стремление получить экономическую свободу не смогла истребить даже царская Россия и мощная пропаганда в СССР, в рамках системы которого мы находились длительное время. Отсюда массовые «вылазки» представителей нашего народа во времена существования СССР в отдаленные регионы страны «за длинным рублем» с ненормированным, тяжелым, но добровольным приложением физического труда с риском лишения свободы в условиях тоталитарного государства, где частная собственность была под строгим запретом. В контексте наших рассуждений – это были массовые попытки получения наибольшего экономического эффекта от использования своих собственных личных ресурсов: физических способностей, времени и интеллекта, вопреки правилам враждебной среды, в которой мы находились.\n\nУникальность нашего случая в том, что вайнахское общество вынуждено было выработать в себе и сохранить ряд важных, необходимых нам сейчас конкурентных качеств в условиях постоянной угрозы уничтожения и критически минимального материального ресурса для выживания.\n\nПоэтому мы стали такими, какими являемся на стыке 20 и 21 века. Когда доблесть и чувство конкуренции во всех аспектах жизни общества культивируется веками и с детства, оно более мобилизовано и способно совершить резкий скачок в развитии, если найдет в себе силы создать государство и сформировать современную нацию в полном смысле этого понятия.", "timestamp": 1658056110, "digest": "jiLdluD-Ww7tTNrl6agDBkq1FVQxVPcYB0-W1HZNJCQ", "contributor": "0x92a825909dcC69591618209ABa8Df71f1F06A91e"}

Over time its meaning has evolved to signal redundant or anything unwanted that accumulates over time. \n\nIn traditional organizations cruft is to be avoided at all costs. It signals inefficiently and waste. \n\nHowever, in dOrgs (decentralized/digital organization), especially ones run online, cruft needs to be reframed into something else - or we risk morphing back into a traditional top down structure. \n\nTo help with this reframe, let’s take a look at decentralized swam organizations like bee and ant hives. In order to find food, many hunting parties scowler a large area of land. These excursions are essentially small experiments that are run in different areas to test if there is enough food to most efficiently feed the hive. \n\nFrom the scouting parties that are sent out, only a small number find a food source that is worth calling the rest of the hive to help collect. \n\nDoes this mean that all the time and energy of the hunting parties that did not find food were a waste of time? Of course not. Their work played an essential role in helping the organization thrive. \n\nIn a similar vein, dOrgs will have projects that get half implemented, or accumulate pages of ideas without any execution, or create proposal after proposal that never see the light of day. Does this mean that these actions should be seen as cruft to be eliminated…like a traditional organization would? \n\nWe know that answer to that. \n\nThen the questions becomes, how do we structure the organization in a way that turns cruft into fuel for the organization to use? How do we frame the cruft as an asset, rather than a drag? \n\nThis might look like creating a position with the responsibility to synthesize and sort the cruft in the dOrg for other contributors to pick up and continue using.

{"id": "5_-rv6x9AbzpNvavIVLQtCkhBz-L4-Avn2AlwMmrm9E", "title": "The women of crypto take over Davos WEF", "body": "Many of you closely follow the gathering of the decision-makers at Davos [during the annual World Economic Forum](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wef-2022-blockchain-and-digitization-to-take-center-stage-at-davos). Many of you have very strong opinions about these gatherings, which I share. Right now, however, I would like to discuss what inspired me the most during those five days of the summit. This was my first Davos event, and I could not help noticing how many women decision-makers were present, in stark contrast to similar crypto events happening in Dubai and Lisbon, for example. \n\nYes, the Promenade at Davos was taken over by crypto companies, exceeding the traditional finance and tech presence, but it was the presence of so many women in senior positions representing every segment of the crypto industry that increased my firm belief that the future of the crypto industry is bright. As operations lead of UpLift DAO, a launchpad for innovative crypto community projects, I interact with our community intensely to keep them engaged, and reach out to as many different sectors as possible.\n\nHaving a diverse community brings greater support to new projects, and ensuring that women are well represented is foremost of importance. It’s exciting now to see women having integral roles in major projects and taking the lead in this space to inspire the community.\n\nMany surveys and reports bemoan the low participation rates of women in crypto — estimates say as much as 85% of the crypto community is male — however, a 2019 study by Grayscale [challenges](https://grayscale.com/research-shows-female-investors-represent-a-significant-market-for-bitcoin-as-investors/) that trend and found that 43% of investors interested in Bitcoin are women. This number has surely grown as cryptocurrencies offer easy and open access to investing, unlike traditionally traded assets and commodities.\n\n***Related: [An open invitation for women to join the Web3 movement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/an-open-invitation-for-women-to-join-the-web3-movement)***\n\nAn April 2022 report [saw](https://assets.btcmarkets.net/reports/BTC%20Markets%20Investor%20Study%20Report%20FY20-21.pdf) women’s participation increase over 170% in the last fiscal year, while men’s usage was just under 80% higher. Moreover, women on average made larger initial deposits, and although they traded less frequently, their portfolios showed more structured strategies and focused positions.\n\nThe evolution and leveling of the financial playing field has come about as information and resources have become more easily accessible to everyone, another result of widespread community-building efforts and transparency built into project designs. While in Davos, I met up with several extraordinary women — from investors to mentors to entrepreneurs and technologists — making waves in the crypto community. These women are impacting the crypto scene right now, dynamic and inspirational pioneers who are paving the way for other women to come to the forefront. I took this opportunity to ask these outstanding women a few questions and am delighted to share their answers with you.\n\n## Marieke Frament, the CEO of the NEAR Foundation\n\n*a non-profit foundation headquartered in Switzerland that oversees the development of the NEAR protocol. NEAR Protocol is a shared, proof-of-stake, layer-1 blockchain that is simple to use and scalable. NEAR is also a certified carbon-neutral blockchain.*\n\n**What makes you excited about the crypto industry?**\n\n“The most exciting thing for me right now about the crypto industry is the infinite possibilities of using blockchain, specifically the NEAR protocol! The opportunities it presents to transform the way we live and organize our lives are truly incredible. DAOs are super exciting and could allow people and society to work and come together in a more inclusive, fair and democratic way.”\n\n**Why were you at WEF in Davos and how do you think women can impact innovation in the global economy these days?**\n\n“Crypto was a prominent theme at Davos this year and it was important for NEAR to be there to back the important initiatives that WEF is championing but also to show the world that we are creating a positive impact in the world with the creation of a protocol that is sustainable, accessible and inclusive for everyone. Blockchain's reputation is that it's bad for the environment, and we need world leaders to realize and understand that it's not the case. In this new world of Web3, diversity is even more paramount, and as the rules are being redefined, we need more women and diversity of thought to build an inclusive future around these new tools. Yet right now in the world of crypto, around 85% of the Bitcoin community [is](https://coin.dance/stats/gender) male. Men [dominate](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/cryptocurrency-has-a-big-gender-problem.html) the investor space and women [account](https://cheddar.com/media/crypto-investor-white-male-survey-demographic-change) for only a third of crypto holders worldwide. This is not sustainable and it won't lead to the positive outcomes we want for society as a whole.”\n\n**What advice would you give to women who want to start their career in crypto?**\n\n“For any women looking to join the world of crypto, I would give the following advice. First off, you don't have to be a developer to get into crypto. Web3, in particular, is about reshaping what we've done on Web2, so pretty much all the skills we require today in Web2 are and will be needed in Web3 and many women are qualified to make their mark in the space. Second, get trained up if you want to become a developer and let us help you! At the moment, Web3 isn't taught yet anywhere, which is why we have launched NEAR University and which is why we are on a path to train millions of developers, both male and female. Finally, my top tips to break into the sector: Start reading and learning as much as you can, and start playing with the tools and DApps that are out there. Also, engage with the companies and projects that resonate most with you and follow influencers on Twitter.”\n\n## Kerry Leigh Miller, a founding partner of Overton Venture Capital\n\n*an early-stage venture fund investing in next-gen consumer brands and services. Kerry invests in, advises and amplifies best-in-class entrepreneurs and thought leaders across industries and functions.*\n\n**What makes you excited about the crypto industry?**\n\n**“**The potential to transform every industry by creating incentives and protocols that have the potential to change the world for GOOD.”\n\n**Why were you at WEF in Davos and how do you think women can impact innovation in the global economy these days?**\n\n“I was there to: (1) share my thought leadership on venture capital, decentralization/Web3, (2) learn from other thought leaders in both business, social impact and politics and (3) create new partnerships. One of the ways where I have already seen women have impact is in DeFi and Web3. I believe women are better communicators.

I believe it is one of the basic dignities for each human to be able to participate in commerce and to make a living, and being excluded from financial and banking systems goes against that.

Given their capability to manipulate market prices, it becomes paramount for the general Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) investors to understand the nuances that make one a whale and their overall impact on trading.\n\nWallet addresses that contain large amounts of BTC are identified as Bitcoin whales. Dumping or transferring large amounts of BTC from one wallet to another negatively impacts the prices, resulting in losses for the smaller traders. As a result, tracking Bitcoin whales in real-time allows small-time traders to make profitable trades amid a fluctuating market.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's global and decentralized nature, tracking down and monitoring whales simply boils down to accessing readily available trading data from crypto exchanges and services. There are four primary ways to track whale activities, which include monitoring known whale addresses, order books, sudden changes in market capitalization and trades on crypto exchanges.\n\nMonitoring known whales provide a headstart to smaller investors as the likeliness of coming across a whale trade increases significantly. Moreover, keeping track of market changes via order books and trades on crypto exchanges indicates incoming whale trades, which can be leveraged to profit during volatility.\n\nThe crypto community also uses free services that inform investors about successful whale trades, often including information about the sender’s and receiver’s wallets and the amount. One of the most popular services for automatically tracking whale trades is @whale_alert on Twitter, which issues alerts related to large transactions as shown above.\n\n***Related: [Bitcoin whales still 'hibernating' as BTC price nears $21K](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whales-still-hibernating-as-btc-price-nears-21k)***\n\nIn a recent market update, Cointelegraph revealed that on-chain data suggested that the largest Bitcoin hodlers were reluctant to act at current prices.

{"id": "EtFJe71VAOedCZ33QtjlhJ0eIV13IhITMn60IYbvrB0", "title": "The women of crypto take over Davos WEF", "body": "Many of you closely follow the gathering of the decision-makers at Davos [during the annual World Economic Forum](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wef-2022-blockchain-and-digitization-to-take-center-stage-at-davos). Many of you have very strong opinions about these gatherings, which I share. Right now, however, I would like to discuss what inspired me the most during those five days of the summit. This was my first Davos event, and I could not help noticing how many women decision-makers were present, in stark contrast to similar crypto events happening in Dubai and Lisbon, for example. \n\nYes, the Promenade at Davos was taken over by crypto companies, exceeding the traditional finance and tech presence, but it was the presence of so many women in senior positions representing every segment of the crypto industry that increased my firm belief that the future of the crypto industry is bright. As operations lead of UpLift DAO, a launchpad for innovative crypto community projects, I interact with our community intensely to keep them engaged, and reach out to as many different sectors as possible.\n\nHaving a diverse community brings greater support to new projects, and ensuring that women are well represented is foremost of importance. It’s exciting now to see women having integral roles in major projects and taking the lead in this space to inspire the community.\n\nMany surveys and reports bemoan the low participation rates of women in crypto — estimates say as much as 85% of the crypto community is male — however, a 2019 study by Grayscale [challenges](https://grayscale.com/research-shows-female-investors-represent-a-significant-market-for-bitcoin-as-investors/) that trend and found that 43% of investors interested in Bitcoin are women. This number has surely grown as cryptocurrencies offer easy and open access to investing, unlike traditionally traded assets and commodities.\n\n***Related: [An open invitation for women to join the Web3 movement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/an-open-invitation-for-women-to-join-the-web3-movement)***\n\nAn April 2022 report [saw](https://assets.btcmarkets.net/reports/BTC%20Markets%20Investor%20Study%20Report%20FY20-21.pdf) women’s participation increase over 170% in the last fiscal year, while men’s usage was just under 80% higher. Moreover, women on average made larger initial deposits, and although they traded less frequently, their portfolios showed more structured strategies and focused positions.\n\nThe evolution and leveling of the financial playing field has come about as information and resources have become more easily accessible to everyone, another result of widespread community-building efforts and transparency built into project designs. While in Davos, I met up with several extraordinary women — from investors to mentors to entrepreneurs and technologists — making waves in the crypto community. These women are impacting the crypto scene right now, dynamic and inspirational pioneers who are paving the way for other women to come to the forefront. I took this opportunity to ask these outstanding women a few questions and am delighted to share their answers with you.\n\n## Marieke Frament, the CEO of the NEAR Foundation\n\n*a non-profit foundation headquartered in Switzerland that oversees the development of the NEAR protocol. NEAR Protocol is a shared, proof-of-stake, layer-1 blockchain that is simple to use and scalable. NEAR is also a certified carbon-neutral blockchain.*\n\n**What makes you excited about the crypto industry?**\n\n“The most exciting thing for me right now about the crypto industry is the infinite possibilities of using blockchain, specifically the NEAR protocol! The opportunities it presents to transform the way we live and organize our lives are truly incredible. DAOs are super exciting and could allow people and society to work and come together in a more inclusive, fair and democratic way.”\n\n**Why were you at WEF in Davos and how do you think women can impact innovation in the global economy these days?**\n\n“Crypto was a prominent theme at Davos this year and it was important for NEAR to be there to back the important initiatives that WEF is championing but also to show the world that we are creating a positive impact in the world with the creation of a protocol that is sustainable, accessible and inclusive for everyone. Blockchain's reputation is that it's bad for the environment, and we need world leaders to realize and understand that it's not the case. In this new world of Web3, diversity is even more paramount, and as the rules are being redefined, we need more women and diversity of thought to build an inclusive future around these new tools. Yet right now in the world of crypto, around 85% of the Bitcoin community [is](https://coin.dance/stats/gender) male. Men [dominate](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/cryptocurrency-has-a-big-gender-problem.html) the investor space and women [account](https://cheddar.com/media/crypto-investor-white-male-survey-demographic-change) for only a third of crypto holders worldwide. This is not sustainable and it won't lead to the positive outcomes we want for society as a whole.”\n\n**What advice would you give to women who want to start their career in crypto?**\n\n“For any women looking to join the world of crypto, I would give the following advice. First off, you don't have to be a developer to get into crypto. Web3, in particular, is about reshaping what we've done on Web2, so pretty much all the skills we require today in Web2 are and will be needed in Web3 and many women are qualified to make their mark in the space. Second, get trained up if you want to become a developer and let us help you! At the moment, Web3 isn't taught yet anywhere, which is why we have launched NEAR University and which is why we are on a path to train millions of developers, both male and female. Finally, my top tips to break into the sector: Start reading and learning as much as you can, and start playing with the tools and DApps that are out there. Also, engage with the companies and projects that resonate most with you and follow influencers on Twitter.”\n\n## Kerry Leigh Miller, a founding partner of Overton Venture Capital\n\n*an early-stage venture fund investing in next-gen consumer brands and services.

There are four primary ways to track whale activities, which include monitoring known whale addresses, order books, sudden changes in market capitalization and trades on crypto exchanges.\n\nMonitoring known whales provide a headstart to smaller investors as the likeliness of coming across a whale trade increases significantly. Moreover, keeping track of market changes via order books and trades on crypto exchanges indicates incoming whale trades, which can be leveraged to profit during volatility.\n\nThe crypto community also uses free services that inform investors about successful whale trades, often including information about the sender’s and receiver’s wallets and the amount. One of the most popular services for automatically tracking whale trades is @whale_alert on Twitter, which issues alerts related to large transactions as shown above.\n\n***Related: [Bitcoin whales still 'hibernating' as BTC price nears $21K](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whales-still-hibernating-as-btc-price-nears-21k)***\n\nIn a recent market update, Cointelegraph revealed that on-chain data suggested that the largest Bitcoin hodlers were reluctant to act at current prices. BlockTrends analyst Caue Oliveira supported the above finding by highlighting a \"hibernation\" continuing among whale wallet. He added:\n\n> \"Institutional movements, or commonly called \"whale activity\" can be tracked based on the transaction volume moved over a short period of time, both denominated in BTC and USD.\"\n\nMoreover, numerous altcoins continue to mimic Bitcoin’s bearish trends as whales await a greener sentiment across the crypto market.", "timestamp": 1658058035, "digest": "Zl9tGhL4QZxqwuri8P8BQoECyZZKHdnz8Xsg5-s0ZnI", "contributor": "0x9B3492b79E45b21156eE02Daec63af6d1B7368b4"}

Axie is a form of “extreme entrepreneurship,” wherein success and failure can happen almost overnight, subject to the dynamics of SLP. Many predictions have been [made](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-10/axie-infinity-axs-crypto-game-promised-nft-riches-gave-ruin) regarding Axie’s coming collapse and lost [trust](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/04/09/between-axie-infinity-and-ghost-recon-why-should-anyone-trust-gaming-nfts/?sh=afc5cfe61ca2) among its players. Can Axie rise to its former glory amid the crypto winter and uncertain global economy?\n\nAs a game lover myself, I was very intrigued regarding Axie Infinity’s future, which led to my desire to research and study it. I interviewed more than a dozen Axie managers, guild members, and scholars –– some are still active while others have quit or gone dormant –– throughout the first half of 2022. I also watched them playing Axie Infinity while asking them questions to make sense of the nitty-gritty issues in the game and assess Axie’s mistakes and potential. I offer some strategies for how Axie can re-engineer its destiny and move forward.\n\n## Smoothing the demand for SLP\n\nOne mistake Axie made was engineering too much demand for SLP. New player influx must be kept steady but not grow excessively in order to offer a smoother demand curve for SLP. This could have prolonged the game’s shelf life. The cost to acquire Axies (the game’s collectible digital creatures that can be used in combat and commerce) –– which will influence how investors and new players plan their return on investment (ROI) and govern their appetite to recruit new scholars –– should be kept steady but slightly growing over time.\n\nAnother mistake is that Axie has been dominated by players from lower-wage countries. This is the case because the SLP earned is highly attractive compared to their local living standards. However, it is too risky to bet on a single group of players. Risk diversification is necessary. Axie can attract players from medium- to high-wage countries and focus on the game’s “fun factor” while putting the “earning factor” as a bonus. A move toward a play-to-own model, where players have a say on the game’s development, is necessary.\n\n***Related: [Crypto gaming and the monkey run: How we should build the future of GameFi](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-gaming-and-the-monkey-run-how-we-should-build-the-future-of-gamefi)***\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes was the abuse of Axie Infinity by multi-account players, which inflated the supply of SLP. I heard stories of single players who played on up to 50 accounts using multiple mobile phones. Axie was too slow to react to this problem.\n\n## Balancing the supply of SLP\n\nAnother mistake was Axie’s in-game economics that reward players SLP for all battles won. This seriously inflated the supply of SLP, which led to the downfall of its value. One strategy to correct this is to introduce more balancing mechanisms that burn SLPs. Examples include having an SLP penalty for those losing a battle.\n\nAnother issue is that many players do not cash out their hard won SLP. A healthy cashing out ratio of SLP is needed to prevent an oversupply of SLP. Axie should keep the “gas fee” in cashing out SLPs extremely low, and can introduce a time-based system for cashing out SLPs or losing them, and set the cost of breeding Axies optimal for burning more SLP.\n\nThe element of uncertainty is important in in-game economics to prevent a game from being exploited by players. Unfortunately, Axie has simply been too predictable in how players are able to win SLPs. Another strategy would be to offer a time delay between the breeding and birth of new Axies, or even adding some SLP costs to raise baby Axies.\n\n***Related: [How will GameFi and P2E blockchain gaming evolve in 2022? Report](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-will-gamefi-and-p2e-blockchain-gaming-evolve-in-2022-report)***\n\n## Creativizing the business model of Axie\n\nA key component of Axie Infinity’s business model is the price of SLP, which is influenced by a host of factors: supply and demand of SLP, supply of Axies, crypto regulations, the volatility of crypto and the behavior of the SLP traders. Thus, the price of SLP is partly manageable and partly beyond Axie’s sphere of influence. Nansen [estimated](https://pro.nansen.ai/axie) that Axie’s $1.35 billion revenue (from May 2021 to May 2022) came mostly from breeding fees (85%) and marketplace fees (13%). This shows how limited Axie’s source of revenue is. Axie Infinity must find ways to expand its revenue sources beyond breeding and marketplace fees.\n\nA more creative business model is necessary. To increase the number of new players, Axie must innovate and offer gaming experience beyond a static environment of its small square battle space, which is very boring for players. The little monsters can be allowed to wander around the world of Lunacia and face danger (e.g., a lethal epidemic) or Axie-eating beasts which will burn SLP or reduce its supply. Players must be allowed to team up their Axies with other players’ Axies in a colossal fight against other Axies — like the epic battles in mecha anime series Gundam — thus increasing new demand for SLP. Co-developing the game with indie developers is essential, but this requires a profit-sharing model for it to work. Axie can also modify Pokémon Go’s approach by allowing players to spend money on decorations, avatars and merchandise to beef up its revenue sources.\n\nSome of my informants suggested that Axie should allow “burning SLP to upgrade into powerful Axies,” “grow the AXS market,” and “host global esports tournaments.” Esports is one lucrative arena in which Axie could make a mark.\n\nAnother mistake was the perceived lack of communication between Sky Mavis, the developer and publisher of Axie Infinity, with its community. Many of my informants claimed that Axie’s plans for the future are cloudy. There have also been complaints about the “power play” displayed by the core team of Sky Mavis against the Axie Infinity community. This requires a cultural fine-tuning in the Axie ecosystem.\n\n## The not so bleak future of Axie Infinity\n\nIn the midst of this crypto winter, Axie sold over 325,000 Axies at more than 3,500 ETH in total, approximately $3.9 million. In my real-time experiments in the game with some Axie scholars in June 2022, the time to find enemies for each battle has remained the same, suggesting that there are still many Axie players out there, contrary to the prediction that most players would leave Axie. There is, however, the temptation for Axie players and managers to join other attractive play-to-earn games. This is a new battle for Axie: the “switchers.”\n\nAxie Infinity might not disappear altogether. It will most probably reinvent itself and chart a new destiny in the fast-changing GameFi landscape.

Can Axie rise to its former glory amid the crypto winter and uncertain global economy?\n\nAs a game lover myself, I was very intrigued regarding Axie Infinity’s future, which led to my desire to research and study it. I interviewed more than a dozen Axie managers, guild members, and scholars –– some are still active while others have quit or gone dormant –– throughout the first half of 2022.

New player influx must be kept steady but not grow excessively in order to offer a smoother demand curve for SLP. This could have prolonged the game’s shelf life.

Axie was too slow to react to this problem.\n\n## Balancing the supply of SLP\n\nAnother mistake was Axie’s in-game economics that reward players SLP for all battles won. This seriously inflated the supply of SLP, which led to the downfall of its value. One strategy to correct this is to introduce more balancing mechanisms that burn SLPs. Examples include having an SLP penalty for those losing a battle.\n\nAnother issue is that many players do not cash out their hard won SLP. A healthy cashing out ratio of SLP is needed to prevent an oversupply of SLP. Axie should keep the “gas fee” in cashing out SLPs extremely low, and can introduce a time-based system for cashing out SLPs or losing them, and set the cost of breeding Axies optimal for burning more SLP.\n\nThe element of uncertainty is important in in-game economics to prevent a game from being exploited by players. Unfortunately, Axie has simply been too predictable in how players are able to win SLPs. Another strategy would be to offer a time delay between the breeding and birth of new Axies, or even adding some SLP costs to raise baby Axies.\n\n***Related: [How will GameFi and P2E blockchain gaming evolve in 2022?

Thus, the price of SLP is partly manageable and partly beyond Axie’s sphere of influence. Nansen [estimated](https://pro.nansen.ai/axie) that Axie’s $1.35 billion revenue (from May 2021 to May 2022) came mostly from breeding fees (85%) and marketplace fees (13%). This shows how limited Axie’s source of revenue is. Axie Infinity must find ways to expand its revenue sources beyond breeding and marketplace fees.\n\nA more creative business model is necessary. To increase the number of new players, Axie must innovate and offer gaming experience beyond a static environment of its small square battle space, which is very boring for players. The little monsters can be allowed to wander around the world of Lunacia and face danger (e.g., a lethal epidemic) or Axie-eating beasts which will burn SLP or reduce its supply. Players must be allowed to team up their Axies with other players’ Axies in a colossal fight against other Axies — like the epic battles in mecha anime series Gundam — thus increasing new demand for SLP. Co-developing the game with indie developers is essential, but this requires a profit-sharing model for it to work. Axie can also modify Pokémon Go’s approach by allowing players to spend money on decorations, avatars and merchandise to beef up its revenue sources.\n\nSome of my informants suggested that Axie should allow “burning SLP to upgrade into powerful Axies,” “grow the AXS market,” and “host global esports tournaments.” Esports is one lucrative arena in which Axie could make a mark.\n\nAnother mistake was the perceived lack of communication between Sky Mavis, the developer and publisher of Axie Infinity, with its community. Many of my informants claimed that Axie’s plans for the future are cloudy. There have also been complaints about the “power play” displayed by the core team of Sky Mavis against the Axie Infinity community. This requires a cultural fine-tuning in the Axie ecosystem.\n\n## The not so bleak future of Axie Infinity\n\nIn the midst of this crypto winter, Axie sold over 325,000 Axies at more than 3,500 ETH in total, approximately $3.9 million. In my real-time experiments in the game with some Axie scholars in June 2022, the time to find enemies for each battle has remained the same, suggesting that there are still many Axie players out there, contrary to the prediction that most players would leave Axie. There is, however, the temptation for Axie players and managers to join other attractive play-to-earn games. This is a new battle for Axie: the “switchers.”\n\nAxie Infinity might not disappear altogether. It will most probably reinvent itself and chart a new destiny in the fast-changing GameFi landscape.

Where true Michelangelos and da Vincis drive progress through their talents without struggling for food and proving themselves all their lives to get a chance to be recognized posthumously? If so, I’m with you.\n\n> *Though creativity has existed as long as humanity, we started to discuss it as the new economic paradigm not so long ago. What’s more, now we even talk about it in the Web3 dimension.*\n\nTo better understand what it is, first, let’s walk through the backstory of the creator economy. How did we actually arrive here? Often, looking back at the past is a great way to get real insights into what is happening today.\n\nIt won’t make you yawn, I promise 😉.\n\n## The backstory of the Creator Economy\n\nThe transition to the creator economy has been long-incoming and uneven. Now let’s explore the major economic and social development shifts that eventually brought us there.\n\n### 1. From the Agrarian to the Industrial Economy\n\nIn the mid-18th century, we got the Industrial Revolution that led to the jump from agriculture to manufacturing. That was when the industrial economy started, and it continued until World War II.\n\n> *The main task of the industrial economy was to produce more goods that would be accessible and affordable for a broader category of people.*\n\nUnlike today’s overabundant reality, goods were scarce and not easily accessible at that time.\n\nTo achieve its goals, industrialization triggered significant economic changes, shifting the power from agrarians to manufacturers, with the latter having become the center of the new economic reality. Industrialization also brought the culture of hard work, competition, and development of new ideas primarily related to the stuff production and automation processes. That was what creative minds were focusing on those days.\n\nIt doesn’t mean there was no place for pure creative activities, like music, writing, or painting, in those days. However, they definitely were not number one on the agenda. Artists just kept going on their own. The creative field wasn’t seen as a separate economic subset deserving some special attention.\n\n### 2. From the Industrial to the Consumer Economy\n\nThe post-World War II period was a time when manufacturers started producing more goods than people wanted to buy. Stuff was no longer scarce.\n\n> *The economy got a new challenge: to make a customer wish to buy what the market constantly offered.*\n\nTherefore, the industrial economic paradigm started getting replaced with the consumer one. Customers (or consumers) had become the central actor of the new economic reality, having replaced manufacturers.\n\nAmong other crucial players who came onto the scene were salesmen, marketers and mass media (TV, radio, newspapers, etc.). The primary job of the first two was to ensure that consumers keep buying, while mass media heavily stimulated the demand for goods, set trends, and shaped attitudes toward almost everything.\n\nAlso, mass media gave rise to phenomena such as pop culture, at the core of which were the production and distribution of creative products geared toward a mass audience. Pop culture was facilitated by the so-called cultural industries that included design, printing, publishing, multi-media, audio-visual, cinematographic productions, etc.\n\n`Unlike the industrial economy, the consumer paradigm brought a tremendous variety of creative jobs and activities. However, creativity, in general, was limited by a major requirement: It had to sell well to the masses.`\n\nHerewith most creators were the employees of corporations.\n\nCreating and growing your audience and earning a living from that were quite challenging tasks.\n\nAs [Paul Saffo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Saffo) fairly mentioned, you could be known only if you were a journalist or worked on TV. Creators who wanted to let the world know about them were always dependent on the discretion of producers, publishing agencies, and other kinds of gatekeepers. To make those guys like you was a necessary prerequisite. Fortune was the most reliable strategy here.\n\n### 3. From the Consumer to the Creative Economy\n\nIn the 1990s, the consumer economy shifted to its *digitization* phase. A huge spectrum of economic segments started transforming with IT solutions. This new economic digital environment launched the demand for a new type of creativity — an innovative and digital one.\n\nSometime later, governments of different states started to officially declare creativity as a “`valuable asset that creates wealth and employs.`” They also injected a new concept of the “**creative industries**” and the umbrella term for them the “**creative economy**” (not creator!) and tasked themselves with providing regulatory and financial support for the latter to strive. Among the first countries that did this were Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the core of the creative economy concept were individual talent, innovation and exploitation of intellectual property. The spectrum it covered was pretty similar to one of the mentioned cultural industries — design, writing, audio, video content, etc. However, in the case of the creative economy, those activities had to be IT-powered.\n\n> *The new challenge here was to bring innovations into most economic segments and satisfy the demand for new digital products and services.*\n\nDespite that the term “creative economy” can make us think about some artist-centered paradise, in fact, like the consumer economy, it was primarily aimed at serving consumer needs. \n\nIt didn’t offer the creators any new groundbreaking ways for turning their talent into independent entrepreneurship. Instead, the creative economy was more about “creativity by employment” rather than stimulating creators to succeed on their own terms.\n\n### 4. From the creative to the Creator Economy\n\nThe next economic shift happened when giant IT platforms such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and the like came onto the scene and started competing with the traditional mass media.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6XSMcnBMJGBMeEQo0-zln.png?height=727&width=1400)\n\nDuring the global financial crisis in 2008, these platforms had become so popular that traditional mass media were getting left behind. People began to live on them and use them as the primary sources of information, knowledge, and networking. ***That was a digital media revolution***. **And that was where the creator economy began.**\n\n> *The task of the new economic paradigm was to convert customers through engagement and participation. Unlike the consumer economy, where customers just bought what was offered, the creator economy enabled them to participate, interact and add value. It also unlocked the tools for promoting themselves as “products” and monetizing on that.*\n\nWriters, musicians, painters, and other types of creators got a tremendous path to promote themselves and reach out to their fans. Instead of pleasing old-fashioned gatekeepers (producers, casting managers, publishers, etc.) to give them a chance, now they can easily use the power of the platforms to share their creativity and find their fans. The barriers were negated.\n\nGenerally speaking, not only professional creators could do it. Everyone with a laptop and an internet connection can now get a chance to try themselves as creators.\n\n# What does the Creator Economy mean in 2022?\n\nAs there is no academically shaped definition for the modern creator economy yet, we can allow some freestyle here:\n\n> ***Conceptually, the current (or Web2) creator economy is an online economic segment powered by a set of interactive digital platforms, marketplaces and tools that enable users to access and create content, as well as monetize it.***\n\nThe creator economy implies no entry barriers or casting. All you need is to sign up and follow platforms’ terms and conditions. Here is the trick: When you use a platform, its algorithm aggregates some of your data and tracks you in some manner. This is the payment for participation.\n\nThe platforms provide you with a variety of tools for content creation, design, and distribution through ads. The latter is the main income source of platforms.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PWD7qikQ21G38mOJX2Qxc.png?height=997&width=1400)\n\nAnother achievement of the creator economy is that it unlocked a wide variety of ways of monetizing work for creators. If in the previous economic paradigms an artist could earn primarily through selling or licensing their IP rights, they can also do it through advertising, tipping, brand sponsorship, affiliate links, streaming, and many other digital marketing activities.\n\nEven if your content is originally not digital, you can still use platforms to advertise your work, engage and convert your audience, find different ways of collaboration, and so on. The sky’s the limit here. However, some cut of your income always goes to a platform (well, a huge one).\n\n> *To sum up, the main goal of the creator economy is to empower the online entrepreneurship of creators by providing them with digital marketing tools and removing any barriers or discrimination.*\n\nSPOILER: The barriers are still there. They are just different. We will look at them closely in the next articles.\n\n# Why do we need to upgrade the creator economy for Web3?\n\nI could probably answer this question by giving a massive list of problems of the current creator economy that have driven us to consider its Web3 upgrade.\n\nHowever, I believe that the primary reason is not in these problems. It is **the mentality shift** that eventually made us spot these problems and realize that there could be a better alternative reality without them.\n\nThe main catalyst for this mentality shift was crypto. It infected us with the ideas of disintermediation, independence from third-party service providers, 100% data ownership and self-sovereignty. Crypto has generated a new way of thinking and caused us to look at ordinary things through entirely different lenses.\n\nInitially applied in finance, crypto’s disruptive mission has spread to many other economic subsets. Now we call it the ***Web3 movement***. And the Web3 creator economy is a special case.\n\nHere is the essence of the Web3 economy concept:\n\n* Eliminating intermediary platforms between creators and their fans.\n* Creator’s owning 100% of their data, brand, and work.\n* Transparency of business processes and money-making.\n* Stimulating authentic creativity instead of ad-driven content production.\n\nI will break this down in the following articles — so stick with me. We will also detail the current creator economy problems and see what kind of solutions Web3 has cooked up for us.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nTo sum up, the creator economy is that organic evolution stage that we’ve come to after passing through all those social developments and economic shifts described herein.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k9iYYE_y-RQWTKXBD8DA-.png?height=896&width=1400)\n\nThe upcoming Web3 paradigm of the creator economy aims to enable creators to build their own independent “open economy” where they can co-own it with their fans and directly monetize it without looking to any third party.\n\nAs some field experts assume, if this model succeeds, **we will enter a new era of wealth generation** where creators will no longer be just the products. Instead, they will become new economies. \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1658059820, "digest": "5p4gpwpY2TU0G0QTBncM4QtxN0Ngn4v6N-V6PyFqqeI", "contributor": "0x17061AC3F0648C2d5fc5a078e3E722d7cF26EcDD"}

{"id": "UntTQYMlA8UGKqBD2bshvRqdJW2O5WgiCLigMdwnLkw", "title": "关于NFT的畅想（三）", "body": "对游戏道具通用性的期待一直是我去年到今年看各类NFT项目和游戏项目时关注的重点。我尤其关注了一些圈内所谓顶级风投投的链游项目。\n\n但让我遗憾的是，我基本上看不出这些游戏之间有什么明显的区别：大家无一例外的就是在游戏中想方设法地加入了经济激励的机制，然后在画风、剧本和玩法上绞尽脑汁。但如果比画风、剧本和玩法，链游无论如何都比不过传统的游戏，而且区块链的性能也比不过传统中心化服务器的性能。\n\n所以我认为如果不基于NFT进行创造和发挥，链游是难以突破传统游戏达到的天花板的。\n\n然而我倒是发现一些新崛起、没有拿过什么顶级风投的小游戏开始有意引入游戏道具的通用性。它们引入道具通用性的切入点是NFT头像。\n\n比如webb.game。\n\n这款游戏尝试让一些知名NFT头像的持有者在玩它的游戏时，直接用自己持有的NFT头像作为自己在游戏中的身份。\n\n我理解它这样做的目的可能更重要的还是希望通过这种方式吸引一些头部NFT的持有者成为自己游戏的玩家，扩大自己的用户群体。\n\n但是我们再仔细想想，持有这些NFT的玩家真的会因为这样就成为这类游戏的重度用户吗？可能在开始的时候，大家会因为好奇去尝试一下，但未来会不会继续玩这个游戏还是要看游戏本身是不是有什么特异之处。\n\n而除去能让用户以NFT头像作为身份这个特点，这款游戏目前所表现出来的特色似乎也并不明显。\n\n所以这种尝试虽然很大胆，但目前看上去效果却也比较勉强。\n\n那为什么NFT的通用性这么难做到呢？\n\n网上一篇文章曾经详细分析了这方面的原因：\n\n一是存在技术上的障碍；二是因为缺少激励机制。\n\n所谓的存在技术障碍指的是虽然都是NFT，但不同项目之间有可能使用的NFT实现标准有所不同，有的使用的是以太坊的ERC-721，有的使用的是ERC-1155。因此在不同的场景中，直接把另一个体系中的NFT拿过来恐怕无法直接使用，需要在技术上进行一定的包装。\n\n这在无形中为项目之间实现道具通用性增大了成本。\n\n不过我认为这未必是关键。\n\n因为在DeFi中，跨链之间资产的转移都能够实现并且流行，那个技术上的难度远远大于这种场景，但那丝毫不影响各类项目对资产跨链的孜孜以求。\n\n为什么？因为跨链资产转账在某些场景下是刚需。而NFT的跨场景通用目前并不是刚需。所以NFT的这个技术障碍是次要原因。\n\n相比较而言，我认为缺乏激励机制反而显得更重要。\n\n在这里，激励机制最重要的是回答这个问题：我的游戏为什么要用你的游戏场景中的道具？这对我有什么好处？\n\n我们都知道，游戏道具的交易是游戏项目方相当大的一个收入来源点，不少游戏甚至直接就是依赖道具的交易来维持其运营和成长。\n\n从这个角度看，我们就会发现NFT道具的通用性在当下的链游生态中不仅不会给项目方带来好处，反而会放项目方的血。\n\n现在绝大多数NFT项目在设计交易过程时都会设定将一定的交易费提成给项目方。因此，如果游戏场景A中的道具能够在游戏场景B中使用，那游戏场景B的用户必然会交易这个道具，但道具交易过程中的手续费却是给原来那个项目方游戏场景A的。\n\n这对项目方B来说简直像“引狼入室”。\n\n所以如果没有极强的激励机制去弥补项目方B为实现通用性造成的这种损失，恐怕B完全不会有动机要去实现什么NFT的通用性，不仅不会有动机，甚至还会极力排斥。\n\n我之所以关注NFT的通用性，是因为我一直认为一个项目的生态要扩大，必须要让其用户群体不断扩大。而如果NFT能做到通用性，那就是最直接能扩大用户群体的方式。\n\n但如果这种方式在当下并不现实，还有什么其它方式能迅速发展和壮大一个NFT的生态呢？\n\n我们不妨想一想另外的思路。\n\n风险提示：投资有风险，内容只是个人分析，仅供参考，不构成投资建议，或许我说的是错的，所以你要小心。\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Daosview)", "timestamp": 1658060656, "digest": "vKRiCP9lINA7Ix4lhyouQxQrajX4mXlRJX3ZDXlgpzY", "contributor": "0x7dE6962797D4bDCDAE15fb4A258E2389fC38ecF7"}

{"id": "25suw_pWHEjtHM3cO-lO5b6sGXkF6Uiks8YRytchcpw", "title": "Bridging Mechanisms And Trade-Offs", "body": "*This is part 2 of a series of posts exploring bridges in crypto, read part 1 [here](https://mirror.xyz/0xEB13a6078D65875D69836F16F469bC5EEb0FcC96/Bj5JUFPjmAlaAv5RxkiYmf0tQBqBfBbQj5zz68dXt6s).*\n\n## Overview\n\nAs we discussed in the previous post, bridges are, to put it in simplest terms, a communication mechanism between two siloed networks. And while we mostly use them for bridging assets today from chain **A** to chain **B**, they *can* be very generalised protocols, enabling much more use cases like:\n\n* Money markets with cross chain borrow-lending.\n* Mint NFT’s on a secondary chain and reserve the asset on canonical chain.\n* Swapping assets on aggregators on a chain but utilizing the liquidity on all chains for minimum slippage.\n\n  And much more.\n\n## Categorizing Bridging protocols\n\nSince there’s a plethora of verticals to build upon, bridging protocols in the crypto space build networks which might enhance and cater to specific purposes, niches, and markets.\n\nBridging protocols can be categorised amongst different attributes that go into the architecture and trust assumptions that they’re built on.\n\n### Trusted  vs. Trustless bridges\n\nTrusted bridges require the user to **give up control of their assets** and **rely on the reputation** and competence of the operator to manage funds (example: [WBTC](https://wbtc.network/)).\n\nTrustless bridges are based on smart contracts and native algorithms governing them. The user **remains in custody** of their funds in a transparent manner via a smart contract. (example: [Connext](https://www.connext.network/)).\n\n### Verification Mechanism\n\n* **Natively verified** bridges run a light client of each other’s chain to verify and communicate.\n\n![Natively Verified](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96_w7qG8OeDKxMPvQUBEJ.PNG?height=511&width=673)\n\nexamples: Near Rainbow Bridge, TBTC bridge.\n\n* **Locally verified** bridges only require the two parties interacting cross chain to verify the transaction.\n\n![Locally Verified](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Loqu5wFx9VWuhT1wzsk4I.PNG?height=537&width=656)\n\nexample: Connext, Hop.\n\n* **Externally Verified bridges** rely on external verifiers not native to either chain to verify and communicate.\n\n![Externally Verified](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7_Q8xLja4L6gabui7aOF7.PNG?height=504&width=664)\n\nexamples: Thorchain, Synapse, Stargate\\*.\n\n*\\* While Stargate is externally verified, there’s contentions about its trustlessness or lack thereof( more [here](https://youtu.be/BCBaByKwP_Y?t=1098) ).*\n\n### Token Transfer Mechanism\n\n* Lock + Mint   < - >   Burn + Redeem\n* Liquidity Pool based\n* Native asset swaps.\n\n## Trade-Offs And The Trilemma\n\nFirst let’s put these architectural choices on a scale of attributes.\n\n![On basis of Trustlessness](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iUyctVxchr_K13uyhqJwD.PNG?height=269&width=791)\n\n![On basis of Extensibility](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v-bSjA1rjCVyBuGM9v6BJ.PNG?height=272&width=785)\n\n![On basis of Generalizability](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8v48BKADhnb5A9cZgFhF0.PNG?height=265&width=790)\n\n* The bridging ecosystem is as safe as the weakest link of bridge. Naturally, natively verified bridges are most secure and trustless and generalizable, but they give up extensibility and scaling\n* Locally verified bridges are quite safe too and has the security of the weaker chain of the two, with a trust assumption that both parties are economically adversarial. The added benefit of this model is that it’s also extensible and scalable.\n* Externally verified bridges rely on external parties off chain to pass messages. Users completely depend on external operators and their design/ competence for safety. Hence are in most cases least secure. However they are most scalable and generalizable.\n\nThis brings us to the trade-offs that each design choice makes, and [the interoperability trilemma](https://blog.connext.network/the-interoperability-trilemma-657c2cf69f17).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hy00G5aDsYuvPcdQz2FKY.png?height=658&width=833)\n\nThe crux of the problem in designing bridge architecture lies in navigating across the trilemma above. You can pick two of the qualities and give away some or most of the third one.\n(in yellow some examples of popular bridges)\n\n## Connext And Amarok Network\n\nAs evident from above Connext is a *locally verified* architecture network. It retains the security of underlying chain **and** is very scalable/extensible to other domains. However this compromises on generalizable message passing which unlock many more use cases.\n\nTo tackle the interoperability problem, Connext came up with a novel network upgrade Amarok.\nAmarok network upgrade basically makes the entirety of connext network more modular.\n\n![Layers of Connext](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nOmqTPJmOXi9jwEv5Cq3B.png?height=248&width=476&size=medium)\n\nAbove image taken from Connext [medium](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), showcases the multi-layer approach to various modes of bridging.\n\nOf note, as a locally verified bridging protocol, Connext will utilize several trust minimized messaging layers for generalized message passing. The most important of which is a close partner **Nomad**.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting stack is application layer which allows cross chain apps to be built on top of Connext (xapps).\n\n![A parting meme.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MzkE3h0wk5qGc1bSGxzZy.png?height=400&width=300&size=medium)\n\nThe next post will explore Amarok in depth, and take a look at some xapps being built.\n\nThanks!", "timestamp": 1658061823, "digest": "wtyrN0SHcn9Tt5Pcu1ycX24BnU3nG07YUvs0jiYhKXM", "contributor": "0xEB13a6078D65875D69836F16F469bC5EEb0FcC96"}

Most of this activity initially took place on the Ethereum network, using [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) as the secondary marketplace. Since then their monopoly has slowly been diluted following several strategic entrants from both centralized and decentralized competitors.\n\nBut which NFT marketplaces will maintain top spot? Seeing the explosion within an NFT bull market has been exciting, but how can these protocols and platforms perform during economic downturn?\n\nThis article provides a brief history of NFTs, reviews the current market status, benchmarks the existing marketplaces and forms a view on the future direction of NFT marketplaces.\n\n## Article Outline:\n\n* Market History\n* Market Status\n* NFT Marketplace Benchmark\n* Macro overlay\n* Future Direction\n* Closing Remarks\n\n## Market History\n\nIt’s important to understand the history of NFTs and how the secondary marketplaces fit into this timeline. Besides [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/) and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/), many of these initial NFTs were traded on their own marketplaces or primitive infrastructure, until Opensea arrived on December 20th, 2017. \n\nFor context, the following diagram shows the brief history of NFTs before the 2021 explosion:\n\n![Source: https://twitter.com/S4mmyEth/status/1516494521680506880?s=20&t=5NusQEYJufvo7k7jUvdX5g](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aM5c4o0i0jdSISFFIqSgd.png?height=452&width=860)\n\nOpensea launched in 2020 with inspiration from the [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) movement. Cryptokitties exploded in 2017 around the new innovative breeding game, which enabled players to breed and trade digital images of cats on the blockchain.\n\nCryptokitties [charged a 3.5% royalty on all NFT transactions on their marketplace. This pushed Opensea to form the current 2.5%](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914081/open-sea-nft-marketplace-web3-fundraising-finzer-a16z) royalty fee that many NFT traders have become familiar with. The reduced fee structure worked and the platform saw millions in volume generated over the next couple of months.\n\nOpensea went on to dominate the secondary NFT marketplace for years, and arguably still does at the moment. In less than a year, they raised $423m which gave them the capital to develop the tools to trade the novel form of ERC721 tokens (NFTs). Although, competition has now intensified with opportunistic competitors developing niches or undertaking [“Vampire Attacks”](https://blog.coinbase.com/vampire-attack-looksrare-vs-opensea-c3b4107cd4db#:\\~:text=Vampire%20attacks%20are%20purely%20a,of%20incentive%20(typically%20tokens).) to take market share.\n\nThe following timeline provides launch dates for the various NFT marketplaces:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XVUmxr4doB43YC9Yya-MN.png?height=1258&width=2852)\n\n## Market Status\n\nThe NFT market is dynamic with exponential growth in the past few years. The landscape has shifted dramatically since Opensea launched in 2020 - The following provides an overview of the current inception to date (“ITD”) (15 July 2022) volume across each of the NFT marketplaces (as per [Dappradar](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces)):\n\n![Inception to date (volume millions USD)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fT9Cb0r0hoR0FYasPd_I_.png?height=762&width=1450)\n\nBesides Opensea and Cryptopunks, the split of marketshare volume over the past 30 days is different to the ITD data:\n\n![Past 30 days (volume millions USD)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wRPuTMQ6l1oTvKu9YBPIR.png?height=756&width=1430)\n\nAnalyzing the movement in volume share between the two timeframes above we can make the following observations:\n\n**1/ Solana Summer**\n\n[Solana pumped in 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2021/11/14/after-solana-summer-is-the-ethereum-destroyer-ready-for-a-solana-winter/?sh=5b192321e369) after NFTs (and smart contract functionality) were launched on the blockchain. This saw a spike in daily active users (“DAU”) as traders and collectors moved over from Ethereum. The new chain made it cheaper and faster to transact, drawing in the masses as Ethereum gas fees sky rocketed to consistent all time highs. The platforms at the time were [Solsea](https://solsea.io/), [Solanart](https://solanart.io/), [DigitalEyes](https://digitaleyes.market/) and [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/). The latter began to take limelight, with the developers continually iterating based on feedback from the community to stay ahead of the curve and deliver the best Solana market place product. They now hold [95% of the market share](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/How-Magic-Eden-Grew-Its-Market-Share/).\n\nIn fact we can see that the Magic Eden DAU on Solana are rivalling those of Ethereum Opensea users:\n\n![Source: DappRadar](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z8o_jm9NwEHqBJBJbtv5D.png?height=466&width=1482)\n\nThis was discussed as part of the [OriginsNFT May’22 monthly report](https://mirror.xyz/origins-research.eth/vPU1zKV0bg_k_uBafGbEfJK25uFZtgYOaJ9WoeMXyOM). Opensea subsequently [opened up the platform to Solana NFT](https://decrypt.co/97139/solana-nfts-opensea-trading-live) trading to capitalize on the uptick in volume.\n\n**2/ Axie Infinity (“Axie”) Market Place**\n\n[Axie](https://axieinfinity.com/) has its own marketplace on [Ronin (Ethereum side chain)](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain). The game’s currency and assets have become hyper-inflationary meaning those playing for profit have ceased trading on the platform. The volume in USD has seen a decline for months now, particularly after the [Ronin Bridge Hack which resulted in $650m seized](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-aftermath-of-axie-infinity-s-650m-ronin-bridge-hack). \n\n[Tokenomics](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-tokenomics-and-why-is-it-important/#:\\~:text=A%20portmanteau%20of%20%E2%80%9Ctoken%E2%80%9D%20and,like%20what%20utility%20it%20has.) is a difficult topic for any play to earn game. Balancing the in game economy/incentivizing players to play rather than sell the token requires continued development to maintain consumer engagement. [Sky Mavis (Axie developers)](https://www.skymavis.com/) have a lot in the [pipeline](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/axie-infinity-roadmap-new-update-latest-news/) but will require them to execute on these ideas to recover their player base to the historical highs of more than a million daily active users.\n\n**3/ X2Y2 Volume Spikes**\n\n[X2Y2](https://x2y2.io/) has seen a significant uptick in volume, more so than [Looksrare](https://looksrare.org/). The platform offers 0% fees on certain collections. There have been [rumours of wash trading](https://twitter.com/punk9059/status/1541797265458724873?s=20&t=gUYCzow2QYUwFpqzPsAB7A) given the unusual sales prices for some lesser known collections which does question the legitimacy of the sales activity.\n\n**4/ NBA Top Shot**\n\n[NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) brought in a lot of interest in the NFT space in 2020 and arguably was a catalyst for the momentum we saw carry though in 2021. The project had its own marketplace on the [Flow blockchain](https://www.onflow.org/). While the platform demonstrated a reasonable amount of volume post launch, this has wained more recently.\n\n![Source: Cryptoslam](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EGIEfRsm5_b5FPkGRZp3y.png?height=1006&width=2878)\n\nThe [Verge attributes this to supply and demand mechanics](https://www.theverge.com/23153620/nba-top-shot-nft-bored-ape-yacht-club) with initial media hype driving the price up exponentially before crashing - The new unique buyers slowly tailed off, driving a decline in the overall price paid for each sporting moment as more flooded the market.\n\n**5/ Mobox & P2E Downturn**\n\n[MOBOX](https://www.mobox.io/momo/#/) is a gaming platform that combines yield farming and farming NFTs to create a free-to-play and play-to-earn ecosystem. The entire P2E/NFT Gaming sector has continued a down trend in volume. We touched on sector analysis in the [May’22 OriginsNFT report](https://mirror.xyz/origins-research.eth/vPU1zKV0bg_k_uBafGbEfJK25uFZtgYOaJ9WoeMXyOM). If we look at the [Nansen gaming-50 Index](https://pro.nansen.ai/nft-indexes/game?platform=All) we can see a downtrend in volume consistent with the reduction Mobox is experiencing.\n\n![Source: Nansen.ai](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v0CvGoQoVGt52iqb00fdR.png?height=1098&width=2224)\n\n**6/ Cryptopunks - Consistent Volume**\n\n[Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) have the historical significance of being the first 10k PFP collection. The collection resonates with many cyber enthusiasts, with numerous [celebrities buying](https://www.benzinga.com/money/cryptopunks-watchlist-celebrities-and-influencers-who-own-punks) into the community. Their own marketplace enables 0% commission on sales and no royalty fees, therefore being a preferred marketplace for punk NFT holders.\n\nThe historical significance alone is not sufficient to maintain consumer attention, as many investors are plagued by [shiny object syndrome](https://twitter.com/omega_eth/status/1514335487372103680?s=20&t=Zvg4DVDGuVyHxlHJUZW8ZA). The project [acquisition by Yuga Labs](https://twitter.com/farokh/status/1502459175162421248?s=20&t=4-MjSQPHYkqGwW9hNELg7Q) (March 11th, 2022) and recent appointment of [Noah Davis](https://twitter.com/NonFungibleNoah/status/1538584141419143168?s=20&t=4-MjSQPHYkqGwW9hNELg7Q) (June 19th, 2022) has maintained the volume in the current poor economic environment.\n\n![Source: https://twitter.com/punk9059](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_PXyDR07jdt71OI7NPOBS.png?height=708&width=1164)\n\n## NFT Marketplace Benchmark\n\nThe trading fees on each platform are the main source of revenue. \n\nWhat are the trading fees used for? Let’s take a look at each marketplace.\n\n![\\*The zero fees for Cryptopunks, X2Y2 and CoinbaseNFT are noted to be temporary and could increase once platform adoption happens.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iwr58Jvs524_vAqGSTexL.png?height=382&width=710)\n\nMany new platforms have offered lower fees to entice new customers, with many decentralized platforms performing [vampire attacks](https://blog.coinbase.com/vampire-attack-looksrare-vs-opensea-c3b4107cd4db) by airdropping the native tokens to Opensea users, based on their trading activity. The idea being to reward and incentivize the most active traders to come and trade on their native, competing platform.\n\nToken holders can stake their tokens and receive a yield generated from trading activity on the platforms. Current yields for token holders as at June 16th, 2022 for Looksrare and X2Y2 are [50.2%](https://looksrare.org/rewards) and [93.4%](https://x2y2.io/) APY, respectively. At glance these yields look tempting, however both native tokens suffered the same fate post airdrop, seeing a 95% fall in price from all time highs. Unless the platforms can generate more trading volume and activity the value of the token will struggle.\n\n![Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/looksrare/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a-n_WOqGhXJXKVbv4vbPv.png?height=1110&width=1930)\n\n![Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/x2y2/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xmtJ9yzx7Av3FMnrKHdvI.png?height=1136&width=1934)\n\nIt’s in the long term interest of the NFT space to move to platforms that reinvest back into development and improve user experience. Especially when there is minimal new capital being injected into the market, otherwise volume and innovation is sucked out of the market with participants focusing on a short term profit rather than long term sustainable growth.\n\n## Macro Overlay\n\nNFTs are a risk on asset and during periods of [quantitate tightening](https://www.ft.com/content/2496105a-d211-4abe-ab5d-46a91876428f) these assets tend to struggle. As is the case with the wider crypto and equities market.\n\nRecent inflation figures [exceeded Federal Reserve expectations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-15/fed-s-broad-based-inflation-expectations-index-rises-to-record#xj4y7vzkg) leading to concerns over further interest rate hikes, currently anticipated to be [75 basis points](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61804877). Liabilities such as mortgage repayments rise, leading to a reduction in disposable income. Investors pull money from the equities and crypto markets to repay loans so as to reduce their liabilities. This increases sell pressure and reduces the medium term trading volume as profitable opportunities become harder to find.\n\nWe can see this activity play out through the daily Opensea volume. Activity continues to downtrend, following the final spike in volume from the [Otherside mint in May’22](https://nftnow.com/guides/otherside-everything-you-need-to-know/). \n\n![Source: Dune Analytics, rchen8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XVUsENBth99ubtnWJ98hi.png?height=598&width=996)\n\nWith lower revenue, companies turn to cost cutting exercises to allow their runway to last longer. \n\n[Opensea has reduced its headcount by 20%](https://twitter.com/dfinzer/status/1547648521607659522?s=20&t=Q_TbsMmcqwqYuNAwjQPFaw) in preparation for the crypto winter. Similar layoffs have been undertaken by [Coinbase](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coinbase-layoffs-cryptocurrency-sell-off-brian-armstrong/#:\\~:text=Coinbase%20plans%20to%20lay%20off,slashed%20jobs%20in%20recent%20weeks.). Many of these job cuts will be removing superfluous roles with core focus on essential development. [Looksrare continues to advertise for developers](https://twitter.com/LooksRare/status/1547657351637127168?s=20&t=o3y1prEvpXGTaZWhK1TRsg) as they drive to take further market share through optimization of their platform. Could we see a shift in key market participants as decentralized protocols incur lower staff costs compared to their centralized competitors? It will be interesting to see how this plays out but will be partly driven by how well management executes decisions during the economic downturn.\n\nSo what do these adverse macro conditions mean for the marketplaces? Risk on assets are less enticing to investors, sell pressure forces the fair value down (along with volume) as traders tend to be more cautious about when to buy or sell these assets. This reduces trading fees and revenue for all marketplaces. \n\nThe question is how long it will last? Well, when macro market sentiment changes then we will see an uptick in volume. Until then, I’d hope these platforms are recalibrating their forecasts to align with current market activity. If not, there will be some more crypto companies suffering similar fates to [Celcius](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/15/celsius-network-crypto-firm-deficit-bankruptcy-funds), [Voyager](https://unchainedpodcast.com/three-crypto-bankruptcies-3ac-celsius-and-voyager-what-happens-now-ep-374/) and [Three Arrows Capital](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/founders-of-bankrupt-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-go-missing.html).\n\n## Future Direction\n\nMany would argue launching an NFT platform in the current economic climate will be a disaster. [Gamestop](https://www.gamestop.com/) has done just that and brought in reasonable trading volume in its first week. Games tend to still be played during bear markets, so a platform specifically for this sector could be reasonably lucrative despite the macro situation. The platform is on [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/), an Ethereum layer 2 solution, which may see some headwinds with most infrastructure built on Ethereum layer 1. Educating gamers to bridge between chains may be a challenge, unless they can create a seamless user interface.\n\nThe [Gamestop NFT marketplace](https://nftnow.com/news/gamestops-nft-marketplace-goes-live-to-mixed-reception/#:\\~:text=GameStop's%20NFT%20marketplace%20is%20officially,aside%20for%20this%20big%20day.) compliments its current gaming business model by expanding into NFTs, with the view of “*empowering the player”*. NFTs and gaming have historically been a [contentious topic](https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-what-could-nfts-mean-for-gaming-and-why-are-they-so-divisive). But the tech provides a solution to decentralized ownership of in game assets - the first mover to capitalize on this could draw in a significant number of new and existing gamers.\n\nSo why is this an interesting observation? We may be seeing specialist marketplaces pop up to dominate particular sectors. Gamestop could use its existing knowledge of gaming ecosystems to create a platform that appeals to a target market they know well. \n\n* We could see Opensea dominate the art collectibles and high value collections on Ethereum. \n* Magic Eden could continue to maintain most of the [Solana](https://solana.com/) NFT market share. \n* Other chains like [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) may have marketplaces like [TreasureDAO’s Trove](https://trove.treasure.lol/) that maintain that niche market dominance. \n* [Reddit is developing NFTs for their avatars](https://nft.reddit.com/) with a partnership with [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/). Reddit generated $17.21m from premium subscriptions last year, so baking in fees to trade NFTs as avatars for their social media platform is a logical revenue growth step and could bring in new eyes to NFT utility. The avatar owners have additional benefits on their platform which provides utility to promote their content. One step ahead of [Twitter NFT verification](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/20/twitter-launches-nft-profile-picture-verification/).\n\nUltimately if a market becomes oversaturated with competitors, then each business will need to develop its own unique selling point (“USP”) to maintain an edge. Opensea was a generalist for a long period because there was no major competition. But that landscape has shifted, and so will each of the platforms in order to survive. \n\nMarketplace security is becoming an increasing focus. Opensea recently suffered a [data leak](https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-data-breach-causes-massive-leak-of-users-email-addresses) that caused many users to question how safe it was to user their platform. The [compromised wallet flagging](https://coin3.net/heres-how-opensea-nft-hacks-hurt-owners-buyers-and-even-entire-collections/) is also becoming a hot topic, with some innocent victims being forced to sell their assets on other platforms at a discount. [Insider trading and fraud](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/06/01/opensea-employee-indicted-for-fraud-over-insider-trading-of-nfts/?sh=79f7de021d26) has also tarnished the platforms reputation. [Punk9059](https://twitter.com/punk9059) raises his [concerns - stating that unless the current practices change then we could see a fall from grace](https://twitter.com/punk9059/status/1548348079111168002?s=20&t=J27-MuobJ69r69Uj83pPyw). We can see that their growth has now turned negative:\n\n![Source: https://twitter.com/punk9059/status/1544307276592386048](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p4o4TnjkMzUK-_xJpQEgn.png?height=1268&width=1174)\n\nAs Opensea struggles with security, [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) plans to launch an NFT marketplace with security at the centre of its ethos. The marketplace is part of Ledger’s wider Web3.0 enterprise distribution platform for artists to create their projects. Ledger Market *[“will be the only safe place to mint and buy NFTs while safely interacting with this ever-expanding world.”](https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-expands-nft-offering-ledger-market-is-coming-soon-enterprise-create-is-now-live)* Using their core competency as their USP certainly makes them one to watch - especially when the general public perception of the NFT space is that it’s rife with scams and hacks.\n\nWe could see some surprise corporate/protocol failures, and subsequent acquisitions, as mismanaged companies/protocols become prime targets for those predators that have large war chests. We’ve seen [this with FTX](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-27/crypto-giant-ftx-ready-with-billions-of-dollars-for-acquisitions#xj4y7vzkg) in the wider crypto space - the NFT space will be no different. We touched on the [contagion and domino effects in a separate OriginsNFT article](https://mirror.xyz/origins-research.eth/fJs23pOHtN-tUIKFCRrRvizPa1nKryK_MJC13x2zHA8).\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nUntil now, Opensea has dominated trading activity across the NFT space. More recently, viable competitors have begun to emerge that could challenge Opensea once market sentiment shifts and trading activity resumes.\n\nIn the meantime all competitors will need to focus on not only surviving, but building an optimal platform to retain or grow their marketshare while the adverse macro conditions play out.

"昨天，差点木进入马网站被盗取钱包全部本金的我，心有余伤的发了个推。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-zniK8DB0yWC-dK5v9M4N.png?height=312&width=1196)\n\n昨天翻盖睡不着，后决定写一篇去博客来详细解释被盗原理方法和骗子常用的解释。\n\n的朋友，想像的朋友，推特的朋友，圈不和谐的朋友圈，不是围绕着网络3的三大平台。\n\n# 一、行骗方法\n\n### 1. twitter私信假冒项目方\n\n自己的项目通过另外官方号宣传的评论，我们通过等方式获得项目可以获奖的方式，有资格通过获得新项目的获奖资格。\n\n骗子用机器人追踪点赞或转发的所有用户，进行用户锁定。并将行骗的twitter小号的头像更改为项目方或者相应管理员头像，对参与项目的用户进行私信，通知 已经被项目方选中获得白名单，然后发送一个钓鱼网站，要求你进入后链接并授权钱包进行白名单地址登记。\n\n点进这些骗子的twitter动态，都是转发项目方相关信息，只不过网站都是假冒的。**这些伪装达到了以假乱真的程度，再加上用户正沉浸在中奖的喜悦下，从而大意进入木马网站进行钱包授权，最终不免钱包被血洗的结果。**\n\n最著名的案例则是年初的伪装Azuki项目方事件\n\n![图片来源：https://www.blocktempo.com/twitter-scammers-are-hijacking-verified-accounts-for-fake-azuki-nft/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/risyCILrHT6U-5WulIqcc.png?height=447&width=1024)\n\n### 2.discord和telegram 冒充项目方\n\ntelegram和discord是以加入频道或服务器的方式，进入项目方创建的群聊中，项目方的信息一般都发不在tg的置顶消息中或者dc的公告频道，但是由于成员的鱼龙混杂，导致骗子藏匿其中。\n当你进入tg或者dc中后，顶着项目方头像的骗子会立刻私信 套路和twitter的私信一模一样，一个恭喜获奖的通知+钓鱼网站 。\n\n**我们进入dc和tg的目的就是获取白名单/ido/预售的权限，当你收到消息后，可能感性高于理性 心里想着 终于轮到我当天选之人了，终于可以不用熬夜抢公售 狠狠赚几E  然而结果确是感性大于理性 未加筛选的 轻松掉入骗子的陷阱 授权诈骗合约后 眼睁睁钱包 被掏空。**\n\n![图片来源：https://mirror.xyz/metastarry.eth/YuNlO5jO9Xu_aafzn0QHTTttmGuARKDEGDrGld-ygcw](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jh_i_e08jJIRsG_yCeHcT.png?height=868&width=1414)\n\n昨天的我就是进入dc后遭遇此种骗术，在钱包链接前瞬间清醒 吓出一身冷汗。\n\n### 3.telegram 群内预售/ido抢发钓鱼网站\n\ntg作为项目方发布和交流信息的主要平台 在项目方会在公布预售时间前的三分钟，频道中会异常热闹，大家都在焦急的等待并催促项目方放出预售链接，骗子此时发布假的预售网站链接\n由于此时的fomo情绪达到顶点，大家都不甘人后，很多粗心的用户在情绪的感染下也不去仔细辨别 从而导致钱包授权后 财产损失\n\n我的一个朋友是被此种骗术套路后损失2b差点退圈。\n\n但是值得注意的是，现在很多项目方会提前10分钟全体禁言  并置顶官方链接 从而防止用户被骗。\n\n### 4.其他骗术（不限于授权钱包）\n\n* tg、dc私信 或短信 邮箱 宣传xx投资机构投资的百倍币项目+官网\n* twitter 机器人 发布free mint nft 官网信息 并@你\n* tg 拉你进金狗同名貔貅群 群里的k线和官网都是真的 只有合约是假的 并且群内90%都是托 疯狂诱导你购买\n* 收到今天是CZ和V神 生日，网站交互就送 100B或者100E（手动狗头）\n\n### 5.骗术总结\n\n一句话概括 **通过各种奖励，诱导你进入钓鱼网站！！！**\n\n**千万不要打开不明网站 ！**\n\n**千万不要打开不明网站 ！**\n\n**千万不要打开不明网站 ！**\n\n私信你发项目官网的 200%都是骗子  正常的白名单都会在 项目方官推 tg频道置顶  dc 公告频道 进行公布\n\n只要别被一时的喜悦冲昏头脑，仔细对照项目方发布网站，哪怕一个字母不一样，都是钓鱼网站\n\n退一万步讲，如果授权后，通过取消授权的方法，也可能挽回部分损失，具体情况在第三部分介绍。\n\n# 二、钱包被盗原理\n\n一句话解释：**只要你的钱包approve（授权）了一个合约，不需要私钥理论上也可以把对应的钱全部转走。钓鱼合约能够对账号里面Token进行操作，而且一般是没有数量限制的。**\n\n注： approve方法是会被链上记录的，可以在etherscan.io中被查看到。\n\n一个钱包approve授权木马合约的脸上记录如下：\n\n![图片来源：https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/D72744536.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6eYrOmcF_gqFeIJf69moD.png?height=544&width=1080)\n\n追溯该转账记录的详细授权信息：\n\n![图片来源：https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/D72744536.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VYuxuWB3-pXJmgvWVljgs.png?height=289&width=1080)\n\n基本上metamask默认授权的时候是\n\n`ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`\n\n转换成数字，我们认识的就是 1.157920892373162 乘以 10 的 59 次方。基本上就可以理解为无限量转账了，也就是这个授权的操作，可以让这个合约无限量的操纵用户账号中的token。\n\n黑客操纵一个可以控制这个合约方法的钱包地址，就发起合约转账方法，随后把钱转走。\n\n### 为什么要approve？\n\n我们在pancakeswap、uniswap上买卖token或者在项目方官网上mint nft 操作时，都需要进行approve操作。\n\n以买卖token为例，无论是在以太链还是币安链，我们的交易都不是点对点交易，而是都需要去中心化交易所DEX的作为媒介，如bsc上的pancake和eth上的uniswap。\n\n![图片来源：https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/D72744536.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Tb0YeAR9RMXHnuQmJL2b.png?height=342&width=721)\n\n**只有对swap进行approve操作后，swap才可以将你钱包中的授权token进行转移进入流动池，从而换取对应的等值代币。如果将钱包approve给swap 则无法买卖token。**\n\n而对木马合约进行授权后，会瞬间触发转账事件\n\n![图片来源：https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/D72744536.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BuPm1Rema0O9CTcqtpCC8.png?height=372&width=1080)\n\n正常的转账，转账方和合约执行的转账方应该是同一个人，而此时的转账的这笔交易，这两个不是同一个地址。推测应该是由一个可以执行钓鱼合约的钱包地址控制执行了合约，然后将我钱包洗劫一空。\n\n**所以以后一定要注意，不要随便给不知道的项目授权！！！\n所以以后一定要注意，不要随便给不知道的项目授权！！！\n所以以后一定要注意，不要随便给不知道的项目授权！！！**\n\n# 三、如何取消授权\n\n既然讲了那么多，那么如何查看并取消授权，从而避免钱包资金被盗呢？\n\nmetamask 官方的技术支持中给出了几个网站可以进行查询并取消：\n\n![图片来源：https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4446106184731-How-to-revoke-smart-contract-allowances-token-approvals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8uPsKysZwQP3tf-IfPiiC.png?height=944&width=1690)\n\n* [Revoke](https://revoke.cash/) (Ethereum mainnet)\n* [Unrekt](https://app.unrekt.net/) (multiple networks)\n* [approved.zone](https://approved.zone/) (Ethereum mainnet)\n* [Cointool](https://cointool.app/approve/eth) (multiple networks)\n* [beefy.finance](https://allowance.beefy.finance/) (BSC/BNB Smart Chain).\n\n如果大家对这些网站持有怀疑，那么可以在[etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/)中取消授权，这个可是妥妥的官网。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/911xuMAzv9Aq1hR__hmiN.png?height=858&width=2546)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4O6T7NeyuY1DHBuKay13R.png?height=722&width=2926)\n\n可以看到，我的eth钱包没有任何授权，这就证明非常安全。\n\nBSC链的只需要在 [bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/) 进行相同的操作即可。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5q31ZqEolBmkE6ZciLN1f.png?height=1004&width=2660)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G9f8b2moYu7bx-O2bupYp.png?height=568&width=1030)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dk-aXL_s1h52qMX9jznw6.png?height=1134&width=676)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1QwPCZbtv6e45bnzUwpE4.png?height=576&width=978)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l72E4M0TrijHWDMpkMzGl.png?height=1346&width=2162)\n\n在BSC上的一个approve的撤销即成功！！！ 多个按相同步骤连续操作即可！！！", "timestamp": 1658063381, "digest": "lECHsR19rrZwhzTJMJ6bD9ZLn_oXZzb9xyr8OnSnQI8", "contributor": "0x6c40E2b266d895C042A6A78B7bB04522872E9E1e"}

On this holy day, Muslim communities would gather to celebrate and pray. They’d also make donations so that others could enjoy this auspicious occasion too. During this year’s Eid al-Adha, CoinEx Charity also made charitable donations in Iran, Turkey, Syria, and Indonesia, with a focus on the poor, the elderly, the disabled, orphans, refugees, and individuals hit by disasters.\n\nThese are often people who cannot afford meat and whose diet lacks calories and nutrients. For many of them, Eid al-Adha is the only time of the year when they can eat meat, and CoinEx Charity intends to make sure that more poor people could enjoy a hearty meal during Eid al-Adha with the help of charity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1G2lrjsdMLrObXIF1g612.png?height=934&width=1400)\n\nOn July 10, 2022, the CoinEx Charity team went to Shiraz in Iran, Antakya in Turkey, Syria, and Tawangsari Village in Boyolali, Indonesia to give out Eid al-Adha gifts to the poor residents, allowing them to celebrate the holiday with a gorgeous meal.\n\nDuring its visit to Shiraz, Iran, CoinEx Charity prepared Eid al-Adha meals for over 1,100 residents and celebrated Eid al-Adha together with the locals. When receiving the food, people smiled and beamed with happiness. For the poor, the festival represents a rare occasion where they get to enjoy a decent meal. CoinEx Charity delivered the warmth they needed as soon as it could.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R-aCBEBrUgXSfvZmzT31l.png?height=788&width=1400)\n\nThe CoinEx Charity team also drove to Antakya, Turkey, and delivered 50 Eid al-Adha food packages to poor families there. Each package contained bread, tomato paste, tea, pasta, rice, sugar, beans, sunflower oil, and macaroni, all of which are part of the locals’ everyday menu. Such Eid al-Adha gifts brought them the joy of the holiday.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wfF1KkjL5bnOOK1veuJGT.png?height=1046&width=1400)\n\n \n During a charity event in Syria, CoinEx Charity visited the Idlib orphanage and distributed Eid al-Adha cash gifts to 50 children there. In Syria, a country that has been suffering from diseases, disasters, and conflicts for years, many children have been orphaned. They are not only the children of Syria but also the children of the world. These orphaned kids deserve to enjoy the festive cheer and happy memories during major holidays like Eid al-Adha.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni7GHKY7ge1o5Db7SIEV3.png?height=932&width=1400)\n\nCoinEx Charity also visited villagers in Tawangsari Village in Boyolali, Indonesia and handed out 50 basic food packages to each household. Grateful for the help, the locals smiled happily when they received the food package.\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Blo4p6g6wwxitQtg2MdB4.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\nHit by the COVID-19 pandemic, disasters, and wars, millions around the world now face existential crises such as poverty and famine. During this year’s Eid al-Adha, CoinEx Charity gave Eid al-Adha gifts to orphans and provided food supplies for poor families, delivering warmth and joy on such a festive occasion.\n\nIn the future, as it continues to send food supplies to families in need, CoinEx Charity will also support them via charitable programs that aim to improve their well-being. This is not the first time CoinEx Charity cared for disadvantaged groups. Since day one, the organization has responded to every call for help and extended a helping hand to people living in impoverished regions via charitable actions, regardless of their race or nationality.\n\nIn December 2021, CoinEx Charity donated care packages to children at Uniuyo Teaching Hospital, Nigeria; In February 2022, it offered New Year gifts to poor families in Iran; in April 2022, the organization sent Easter presents to over 500 poor children in the north of Sao Paulo, Brazil. In addition to humanitarian response, CoinEx Charity also spared no effort in terms of disaster relief and charitable education.\n\nThe institution offered immediate help to locals via donations and real actions when typhoon Rai hit the Philippines and when Brazil suffered from heavy rainfalls. From May to June 2022, CoinEx Charity visited poor schools in 11 countries. It provided over 10,000 books for more than 8,000 students, helped the schools build reading corners, and donated school supplies.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RqxmqXCsZA8-9UXRzzXXN.png?height=776&width=1400)\n\nSince its inception, CoinEx Charity has been passing forward messages of love. Driven by the power of charity, the institution helps disadvantaged groups around the world. It embraces people everywhere and builds friendly ties with individuals from all countries. Through different charity events, CoinEx Charity encourages the public and charities to pay attention to the poor and disadvantaged groups. The organization calls on people to join hands with it in contributing to charity and creating hope for people in need.\n\nFind us here:\nWebsite ▶️ <https://www.coinex.com>\nTwitter ▶️ <https://twitter.com/coinexcom/>\nTelegram ▶️ <https://t.me/CoinExOfficialEN>\nMedium ▶️ <https://medium.com/@coinex>\nReddit ▶️ <https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinEx/>\nFacebook ▶️ <https://www.facebook.com/thecoinex/>\nInstagram ▶️ <https://www.instagram.com/coinexcom/>", "timestamp": 1658063856, "digest": "pStyKCh2PNQT5bGt-scENFyTtkRmfJY_rOGFJTy_UCk", "contributor": "0xD5806ddb5249d34D389aB4D4a042AD24e05cef39"}

It was the first time that I participated at this type of conference and boy, it was nothing like what I had imagined in my mind.\n\nAs my background lies in hospitality, I had the chance of participating at some smaller and bigger industry gatherings. However, these always seem very tight and without a real connection between participants and the topics discussed or presented.\n\nThe event’s organization was great, with a registration, coffee and merch areas downstairs ( big open room), complemented by a live DJ booth and 2 NFT expositions.\n\nUpstairs, there were two stages - Sky (main) and Forrest ( secondary) and different areas like - co-working area, Workshop area, Relaxation area, another NFT exposition and a Sponsor’s area ( all these areas had specific names - however, I don’t remember them all). On the 1st floor there was also a huge terrace where the 2nd DJ booth was placed, as well as a bar.\n\n10 days after the event, and I am still processing all the talks, panels and workshops I attended. Being my first crypto conference, I was thirsty for information, so the first two days, I attended events back to back. Although my focus was on DAO related topics, some really new concepts (for me) that attracted my interest were Regenerative Finance & Regenerative Economy. \n\nIf you are curious to have a deeper dive in my [ETH Barcelona](https://twitter.com/eth_barcelona) experience, check-out this thread on Twitter, where I tried to summarize each day 👇\n\n[https://twitter.com/OctavCrypto/status/1544310514033065984?s=20&t=T0LudN18BeUmU6GmVPYaQg](https://twitter.com/OctavCrypto/status/1544310514033065984?s=20&t=T0LudN18BeUmU6GmVPYaQg)\n\nAs my friend, [Vru](https://twitter.com/Vrudubz) said it: it was a conference with a festival vibe. I think this summarize [ETH Barcelona](https://twitter.com/eth_barcelona) the best. The participants, the organizers, the speaker, the volunteers - all seemed to be happy to be here and connect with fellow like-minded people. From noobs to OG, everyone felt welcomed and included.\n\nI feel very grateful for having the opportunity to attend this event, and learn so much in such a short period of time. [ETH Barcelona](https://twitter.com/eth_barcelona), filled me with knowledge, connections, and drive to buidl.\n\nMy next stop is [ETH Toronto](https://www.ethtoronto.ca/) and the [Futurist Blockchain Conference](https://www.futuristconference.com/) taking place between 6th and 10th of August in Toronto, Canada. \n\nThis time, I will participate as a volunteer, so I am very excited about what this experience will bring.", "timestamp": 1658064862, "digest": "om1QIWFjBvIWB93kCz-sAJmGMMbw9viv-72LdP2TC90", "contributor": "0xA2944098eE88B83B10f13194afcBf1d72916c58b"}

一、行骗方法\n\n### 1. twitter私信假冒项目方\n\n自己的项目通过另外官方号宣传的评论，我们通过等方式获得项目可以获奖的方式，有资格通过获得新项目的获奖资格。\n\n骗子用机器人追踪点赞或转发的所有用户，进行用户锁定。并将行骗的twitter小号的头像更改为项目方或者相应管理员头像，对参与项目的用户进行私信，通知 已经被项目方选中获得白名单，然后发送一个钓鱼网站，要求你进入后链接并授权钱包进行白名单地址登记。\n\n点进这些骗子的twitter动态，都是转发项目方相关信息，只不过网站都是假冒的。**这些伪装达到了以假乱真的程度，再加上用户正沉浸在中奖的喜悦下，从而大意进入木马网站进行钱包授权，最终不免钱包被血洗的结果。**\n\n最著名的案例则是年初的伪装Azuki项目方事件\n\n![图片来源：https://www.blocktempo.com/twitter-scammers-are-hijacking-verified-accounts-for-fake-azuki-nft/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/risyCILrHT6U-5WulIqcc.png?height=447&width=1024)\n\n### 2.discord和telegram 冒充项目方\n\ntelegram和discord是以加入频道或服务器的方式，进入项目方创建的群聊中，项目方的信息一般都发不在tg的置顶消息中或者dc的公告频道，但是由于成员的鱼龙混杂，导致骗子藏匿其中。\n当你进入tg或者dc中后，顶着项目方头像的骗子会立刻私信 套路和twitter的私信一模一样，一个恭喜获奖的通知+钓鱼网站 。\n\n**我们进入dc和tg的目的就是获取白名单/ido/预售的权限，当你收到消息后，可能感性高于理性 心里想着 终于轮到我当天选之人了，终于可以不用熬夜抢公售 狠狠赚几E  然而结果确是感性大于理性 未加筛选的 轻松掉入骗子的陷阱 授权诈骗合约后 眼睁睁钱包 被掏空。**\n\n![图片来源：https://mirror.xyz/metastarry.eth/YuNlO5jO9Xu_aafzn0QHTTttmGuARKDEGDrGld-ygcw](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jh_i_e08jJIRsG_yCeHcT.png?height=868&width=1414)\n\n昨天的我就是进入dc后遭遇此种骗术，在钱包链接前瞬间清醒 吓出一身冷汗。\n\n### 3.telegram 群内预售/ido抢发钓鱼网站\n\ntg作为项目方发布和交流信息的主要平台 在项目方会在公布预售时间前的三分钟，频道中会异常热闹，大家都在焦急的等待并催促项目方放出预售链接，骗子此时发布假的预售网站链接\n由于此时的fomo情绪达到顶点，大家都不甘人后，很多粗心的用户在情绪的感染下也不去仔细辨别 从而导致钱包授权后 财产损失\n\n我的一个朋友是被此种骗术套路后损失2b差点退圈。\n\n但是值得注意的是，现在很多项目方会提前10分钟全体禁言  并置顶官方链接 从而防止用户被骗。\n\n### 4.其他骗术（不限于授权钱包）\n\n* tg、dc私信 或短信 邮箱 宣传xx投资机构投资的百倍币项目+官网\n* twitter 机器人 发布free mint nft 官网信息 并@你\n* tg 拉你进金狗同名貔貅群 群里的k线和官网都是真的 只有合约是假的 并且群内90%都是托 疯狂诱导你购买\n* 收到今天是CZ和V神 生日，网站交互就送 100B或者100E（手动狗头）\n\n### 5.骗术总结\n\n一句话概括 **通过各种奖励，诱导你进入钓鱼网站！！！**\n\n**千万不要打开不明网站 ！**\n\n**千万不要打开不明网站 ！**\n\n**千万不要打开不明网站 ！**\n\n私信你发项目官网的 200%都是骗子  正常的白名单都会在 项目方官推 tg频道置顶  dc 公告频道 进行公布\n\n只要别被一时的喜悦冲昏头脑，仔细对照项目方发布网站，哪怕一个字母不一样，都是钓鱼网站\n\n退一万步讲，如果授权后，通过取消授权的方法，也可能挽回部分损失，具体情况在第三部分介绍。\n\n# 二、钱包被盗原理\n\n一句话解释：**只要你的钱包approve（授权）了一个合约，不需要私钥理论上也可以把对应的钱全部转走。钓鱼合约能够对账号里面Token进行操作，而且一般是没有数量限制的。**\n\n注： approve方法是会被链上记录的，可以在etherscan.io中被查看到。\n\n一个钱包approve授权木马合约的脸上记录如下：\n\n![图片来源：https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/D72744536.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6eYrOmcF_gqFeIJf69moD.png?height=544&width=1080)\n\n追溯该转账记录的详细授权信息：\n\n![图片来源：https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/D72744536.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VYuxuWB3-pXJmgvWVljgs.png?height=289&width=1080)\n\n基本上metamask默认授权的时候是\n\n`ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`\n\n转换成数字，我们认识的就是 1.157920892373162 乘以 10 的 59 次方。基本上就可以理解为无限量转账了，也就是这个授权的操作，可以让这个合约无限量的操纵用户账号中的token。\n\n黑客操纵一个可以控制这个合约方法的钱包地址，就发起合约转账方法，随后把钱转走。\n\n### 为什么要approve？\n\n我们在pancakeswap、uniswap上买卖token或者在项目方官网上mint nft 操作时，都需要进行approve操作。\n\n以买卖token为例，无论是在以太链还是币安链，我们的交易都不是点对点交易，而是都需要去中心化交易所DEX的作为媒介，如bsc上的pancake和eth上的uniswap。\n\n![图片来源：https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/D72744536.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Tb0YeAR9RMXHnuQmJL2b.png?height=342&width=721)\n\n**只有对swap进行approve操作后，swap才可以将你钱包中的授权token进行转移进入流动池，从而换取对应的等值代币。如果将钱包approve给swap 则无法买卖token。**\n\n而对木马合约进行授权后，会瞬间触发转账事件\n\n![图片来源：https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/D72744536.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BuPm1Rema0O9CTcqtpCC8.png?height=372&width=1080)\n\n正常的转账，转账方和合约执行的转账方应该是同一个人，而此时的转账的这笔交易，这两个不是同一个地址。推测应该是由一个可以执行钓鱼合约的钱包地址控制执行了合约，然后将我钱包洗劫一空。\n\n**所以以后一定要注意，不要随便给不知道的项目授权！！！\n所以以后一定要注意，不要随便给不知道的项目授权！！！\n所以以后一定要注意，不要随便给不知道的项目授权！！！**\n\n# 三、如何取消授权\n\n既然讲了那么多，那么如何查看并取消授权，从而避免钱包资金被盗呢？\n\nmetamask 官方的技术支持中给出了几个网站可以进行查询并取消：\n\n![图片来源：https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4446106184731-How-to-revoke-smart-contract-allowances-token-approvals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8uPsKysZwQP3tf-IfPiiC.png?height=944&width=1690)\n\n* [Revoke](https://revoke.cash/) (Ethereum mainnet)\n* [Unrekt](https://app.unrekt.net/) (multiple networks)\n* [approved.zone](https://approved.zone/) (Ethereum mainnet)\n* [Cointool](https://cointool.app/approve/eth) (multiple networks)\n* [beefy.finance](https://allowance.beefy.finance/) (BSC/BNB Smart Chain).\n\n如果大家对这些网站持有怀疑，那么可以在[etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/)中取消授权，这个可是妥妥的官网。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/911xuMAzv9Aq1hR__hmiN.png?height=858&width=2546)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4O6T7NeyuY1DHBuKay13R.png?height=722&width=2926)\n\n可以看到，我的eth钱包没有任何授权，这就证明非常安全。\n\nBSC链的只需要在 [bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/) 进行相同的操作即可。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5q31ZqEolBmkE6ZciLN1f.png?height=1004&width=2660)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G9f8b2moYu7bx-O2bupYp.png?height=568&width=1030)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dk-aXL_s1h52qMX9jznw6.png?height=1134&width=676)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1QwPCZbtv6e45bnzUwpE4.png?height=576&width=978)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l72E4M0TrijHWDMpkMzGl.png?height=1346&width=2162)\n\n在BSC上的一个approve的撤销即成功！！！ 多个按相同步骤连续操作即可！！！\n\n# 四、写在最后\n\n就在我构思这篇博客的时候，突然间收到了下面这条消息。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kNyT99s8PRhfteXpUWSWP.jpeg?height=971&width=1110)\n\n希望大家用过permint平台的，赶快按照第三部分的去进行取消授权操作，谨防意外损失。\n\n**在Web3的黑暗森林中，任何用户或平台都是猎物，黑客就像隐藏其中的猎人，永远要提高警惕，防止黑暗中的獠牙随时向你扑来。**\n\n最后，希望大家多关注我的twitter，以后会分享更加有趣和有深度的内容。\n\n[https://twitter.com/CoolBerwin](https://twitter.com/CoolBerwin)\n\n",

{"id": "Oe9ujc4zE0CTgF1PqvrpTZeiFaguJoZyJ_3rnlFQFyw", "title": "Last Year I Drank Tequila\n", "body": "And then a beer, a margarita, a couple vodka sodas, and two more tequila shots.\n\nLast year I drank tequila. This year I don’t.\n\nNovember 2017. The bars in Boston’s Fenway neighborhood close at 2 am on weekends. It is now 3:30 am and I am aimlessly wandering the streets in a T-shirt. Cold and drunk. I lost my jacket, my friends, and my phone is dead.\n\nA month before that night, I came to on a stoop in South Boston. Food at my feet, arms covered in sharpie ink, unaware of how a Saturday bike ride turned into a 2-day binge drink through the neighborhoods of Boston. But the unread text messages told me I had a good time. Good time, huh?\n\nOh, I almost forgot. Squeezed in between these two nights was the time I drove the 45 minutes home at 2:30 am — drunk and videoing every time I passed 100mph. *“Which time?”* is right, as this happened more than once.\n\nI don’t include these stories in an attempt to glorify my nights out, nor to legitimize my party life. The party life I had. If anything, typing these words out are both painful and embarrassing. These were the moments that sparked my sobriety. For so long, I had policed myself by saying “no drinking for one week” or “Dry January” only to return to alcohol and to experience similar chapter endings. **Insanity.** These were temporary band-aid resolutions to a larger problem. These were the moments that led to the decision to be firm and go sober.\n\n**Sober at 26.**\n\nI hesitate to use the words *lucky*, as it implies that this story is almost heroic, as if I was chosen. I prefer to use the word *foolish*. I believed alcohol was cool. Or maybe not cool, but necessary. I didn’t know that I could be a star without it and I invested so much of my identity in the culture of drinking.\n\nIn the year and 10 days since going sober, I’ve answered “why did you stop drinking?” many times, but haven’t spent much energy into looking at why I drank. So here goes.\n\nIn high school, it was for the feeling of rebellion, of tasting the dessert before dinner. In college, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the feeling of losing control and getting attention: the attention of being the wildest man at the party, of being the last man standing. And from there it continued. Living and traveling in Europe, it was both to engage in the culture and as an act of pure enjoyment.\n\nBut it was difficult to have just one beer, just one glass of wine. **“Bring another bottle!”** Life was too much fun when drinking, and I thought the thrill of a night out was more favorable than the hangover, the financial anxiety, the lack of motivation, and the impact on my mental health that followed.\n\nIf I was going out, I was going all the way out.\n\nGoing sober is not a popular decision. For the first few months, I wasn’t able to articulate my reasons even well enough for my family or my close circle. For me, there was too much shame. I left out some parts. The parts that might have hurt my mother, my friends. I hid. [Four months passed before I was able to talk about it publicly](http://www.eatgreenmakegreen.com/podcast-1/2018/4/15/episode-52-richard-crowley-). Now, my response is stronger.\n\nI am sober because the hangovers became too much. They crept from my body to my mind. They ruined my ambition and my mental health. I am sober because I lost my confidence without alcohol. I am sober because I couldn’t control my spending and a night out left me financially unwell and anxious. **I am sober because drinking became dangerous to myself and others around me.**\n\nI knew all of this during my days of glass clutching, but one drink would allow me to forget.\n\nThe pages of my 12-year affair with alcohol are filled with empty romances, dishonest conversations, broken promises, danger and blood. And again, this is not me bragging, but me attempting to acknowledge that I thought I was invincible. I could always have one more drink, one more line, one more pill. I was proud of this and would boast that “*I can handle drinks and drugs, they don’t change me.*” This was a lie. And I am fortunate that life never truly called my bluff.\n\nI still have a level of discomfort when it comes to my sobriety. I am comfortable owning who I am, who I was and any actions that I took when drinking, but it is the identity and associations that come with being sober, that I have yet to navigate.\n\nWas I an alcoholic? Am I an alcoholic?\n\nWhen discussing my sobriety, I don’t use the word “alcoholic” as if my story isn’t as tragic enough. Problem drinker, alcohol misuse, yes, but alcoholic, no. And maybe my distance from this word is rooted in shame. I am proudly part of the sober community, but do I belong to the recovery community? The answer is yes, and one I am still navigating.\n\nAlcohol consumption is a spectrum. Shaped like a U. At one end, there are those who have never enjoyed alcohol. They don’t drink. The other end is also a group that doesn’t drink, those that are now sober. **That’s where I am.** In the middle, we have the casual-glass-of-wine crew, social drinkers, problem drinkers, misusers, abusers, and alcoholics. But where do you draw the line? Is a problem drinker just an alcoholic that hasn’t had a tragedy snap them out of it yet? It’s blurry, to say the least. And what exactly constitutes a tragedy? Is a broken promise not enough? Is putting myself in danger, even though “nothing happened”, not enough?\n\nMy struggle now is in identifying my past. My present is as a person who is sober, but I crave an association for my past. I was a person who misused alcohol, and that is why I am sober. But am I being unfair to myself, or to those who are also sober by rejecting my association with alcoholism? I don’t have an answer for this. I was fortunate to never have tragedy mark the narrative of my alcohol consumption, just missteps, just close calls. Maybe that is why I lack the ability to identify with alcoholism.\n\nDecember 28th, 2018 at 10 am marked one year sober. I’m often asked, will you drink again? My answer used to be, “*yeah I will figure out how to introduce a glass of wine, or a beer back into my routine*”, but now I am resolute: there is no need for me to do that. That would be a compromise and insult to the work that I’ve put in.\n\nSince going sober, I have become who I want to be. My mind is in the best place it has been in years. I am generating ideas, processing conversations, and creating a sanctuary for myself within myself.\n\nMy health is at its peak as well. My diet, my relationships, my ambitions. I am in a place that I am proud of and I don’t want to sacrifice any of that for some carbonation or a sweet grape.\n\n*“Thank you for the offer, but I’ll pass. May I still sit here?”*\n\n_\n\n`Every year, I reflect on the previous 365 days of my sobriety with a Soberversary piece. Each Soberversary piece is published as a collectable NFT with a quantity of 26 to celebrate the age at which I chose sobriety. The price of each NFT set in hundredths of 1 ETH, equal to the Soberversary number being reflected on.`", "timestamp": 1658066074, "digest": "D3HiuO6LS3dv1wC4x569T3NPjq-Ypl5II15aKyL4ve8", "contributor": "0xF7bcCC29ae64F761A887eFc486Bcbd2d54209620"}

The first time I heard the claim that every business will implement NFTs it sounded oddly familiar to BTC maximalist narratives. Here is a new technology that is magically going to solve all our problems and transform society.\n\n**But I’ve converted. NFTs are actually the future. Let me explain.**\n\nBlockchains are a phenomenal invention. Bitcoin solved the problem of how to get complete strangers to agree on something as valuable as money. An underrated consequence of Bitcoin’s success is popularizing the concept of digital scarcity.\n\nEthereum extended the capabilities of the blockchain. Now the entire economy can be represented on-chain. Indeed, we are seeing marketplaces, loans, stocks and options all being put on-chain. Our newfound capabilities to represent these financial instruments on-chain led to a DeFi wave that minted many nouveaux riches.\n\nBut that is simply what they are, financial instruments. They are not the things everyday people use in their daily life. If we are to represent the entire economy on-chain we need an additional piece of infrastructure: NFTs.\n\nNFTs can represent anything scarce. Almost the entire world is non-fungible, only financial instruments are not. To have on-chain representations of our possessions like cars, watches, houses and intangibles such as music and in-game items, we need NFTs. Tokens that represent something unique.\n\nNFTs are also bringing communities together that align around a goal, such as [buying a golf course,](https://linksdao.io/) [a vacation manor](https://manordao.com/), or [adopting a football team](https://wagmiunited.com/). People are using NFTs as their (online) identity. And each NFT collection such as CryptoPunks and Bored Apes have different cultures associated with it. If you don’t realize how big of a deal this is check out the following tweets by @punk6529:\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1424127519658229760](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1424127519658229760)\n\nCulture is our most valuable asset. NFTs are eating culture. They are a way to own it, and to represent it financially. The market size of intangibles is in the trillions.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1430281972920770560](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1430281972920770560)\n\nNFTs could therefore represent something bigger than the fungible tokens we have seen dominate the crypto space so far.

Anything that is on-chain follows the same standards that programmers can build on top of. Similarly, every app, wallet, and exchange that wants to interact with these types of assets integrates code that can interact with these standards.\n\nThink about the kind of coordination it would take if you wanted to get insurances, art, tickets, wine bottles, and music all on the same standards. With blockchains you can trade, own, and use all assets using the same apps, wallets, and exchanges. \n\nIn theory it's possible to make a global API without blockchains, but in practice this hasn't happened, and would be impossible to coordinate. Having a fully composable economy reduces friction and unlocks new possibilities for cross-sector applications.\n\n**Transparency and perfect provenance**\n\n[https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1548352845379878912](https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1548352845379878912)\n\nThe blow-up of Luna and Three Arrows Capital was resolved almost instantly on-chain. The ripple effects, or contagion, only became clear days or weeks after these blow-ups happened. Investors had no idea what companies like Celsius and BlockFi were doing with their money and many now have frozen funds on these insolvent platforms.\n\nTransparency is inherent to blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. Anyone with an internet connection can check the data and see a perfect record of the history of every on-chain asset. An on-chain economy is less prone to blow-ups such as the 2008 economic crisis. On the blockchain, there is no way for banks to lend out the same dollar to 10 different companies and socializing the risk to innocent people. Given how much impact the 2008 crisis had on many people’s lives, this benefit is not to be overlooked. \n\n**Uncensorable and provably equal**\n\nBlockchains are agnostic to its users. Anyone can access the data, anyone can send a transaction, and anyone can become a validator.\n\nYou cannot be kicked off the blockchain like you can off Facebook or Twitter (even if you are the president of the United States). You can get a loan and a savings account without experts deeming you worthy enough. The fact that blockchains do not discriminate between users means that people from all over the world will have the exact same economic tools at their disposal as the most powerful people.\n\n**Removing trusted third parties**\n\nOver the last decades we have become increasingly dependent on the internet for our livelihoods, social life, entertainment, and information. The internet is ran by a select group of companies that own all your data and digital assets. Trusted third parties existed before the internet (governments, banks), but our reliance on them has vastly increased as we have transitioned more and more into the digital world.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1443921349676867586](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1443921349676867586)\n\nWith blockchains you trust code, rather than people. The code is open source and can be checked by anyone with the technological know-how. By replacing people with code you make it impossible to cheat, to commit fraud, and to break contracts. Additionally, consumers would actually own their digital assets such as their social media accounts and content, in-game items, and online courses.\n\nThe major benefits of removing trusted third parties are:\n\n* Trusted third parties in the digital world tend to become monopolies. If we move increasingly digital, the world is at risk to be run by a handful of Big Tech companies.\n* Trusted third parties form a single point of failure. Imagine what could happen if the government implements central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their system gets hacked. Or what if a dictator takes over in 10, 20 or 30 years and demands control of Facebook’s Metaverse?\n* Ownership for consumers. It is arguably better to own your assets, than to risk being denied access. If citizens truly own their assets it is impossible for a Justin Trudeau to cut you off the payment system.\n\nEven in a blockchain world, trusted third parties will still exist. There need to be entities that put real-world assets on-chain and regulatory bodies that keep these entities in check. For real-world assets therefore, the main benefit of going on-chain is efficiency. For intangible goods and digitally native assets, we can now just trust the code.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\nThere are so many benefits to putting our economy on-chain. If assets are composable, globally accessible, uncensorable, and all of that with true ownership, the economy would get rid of many market inefficiencies. It will become easier to buy and sell virtually any good, to proof who owns what, [to own culture](https://mirror.xyz/0x5B3DaFc35dcf434153B5DF2be2C493Df4403AA75/G_nMiwWU48y3rUmMo4JdmPrStPJDCdHS6SOCRq5FTuE), and to ensure people follow the rules (cheating is not possible on-chain). I envision that everyone will have hundreds or thousands of NFTs in their wallets, ranging from sneakers and tickets to art and diplomas. The benefits of having these assets represented as NFTs and connected to the rest of the on-chain economy will be too great to not do it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KDZNRcDISyFhZC6C1Jc5l.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\nBlockchains enforce values such as equality of opportunity, truth, transparency, and autonomy. I think a society that runs on blockchains will be significantly more democratic. In my mind, the alternative is a world ran by a handful of Big Tech companies, that could be taken over by governments like China or the USA at any moment. This issue will become especially important as we move to augmented and virtual reality and technology becomes even more embedded into our lives.\n\nMany challenges remain before we can have our on-chain economy. We need to onboard billions of users, have simple methods for keeping your assets secure, reduce the possibility of human error (sending to wrong address), and we need to speed up the technology and lower transaction costs. Lastly, the biggest of challenge of all is regulation. I am convinced that a fully functional blockchain-based economy would benefit >99.99% of the world. However, the winners of the old system and people that misunderstand blockchains, will prefer having centralized systems win out. The regulatory battle is one that we must win to protect our freedom. If we do, I think almost every asset will go on-chain. This would give us more freedom and could unlock a new wave of human creativity.\n\nps. thanks to [@punk6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529) for many great insights.

的”这个人的意见。没有国王统治者或明确的路线图图——MFers可以用MFers来制造他们能够重新获得这些东西。”\n\n在今年6月9日创始人Sartoshi宣布离开MFers的社区，自此MFers走上了完全的去中心化品牌建设之路，没有任何人拥有版权，每个人都拥有版权，在人们对MFers的创作过程中每一个MFers持有人都将因为品牌价值的提升而从中获益。这种众筹的品牌建设模式会走向何方？相信时间会给出完美的答案。\n\n## 5.Fidenza：Artblocks与NFT的艺术用途\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-0JhpSlKPcYt06OasG1JM.png?height=1086&width=906)\n\n生成艺术家Tyler Hobbs的NFT项目“Fidenza”于去年6月在NFT平台Art Blocks上线。“Fidenza”由Hobbs设计的算法随机生成，并包含丰富多彩的曲线和方块，发行后大获成功，其中Fidenza #313 以 1,000 ETH（购买时为 330 万美元）易手，爆火后为Artblocks平台每天带来数百万美元的交易量。\n\n尽管加密艺术和数字艺术有着悠久的历史，但 ArtBlocks 是第一个将艺术NFT成功推向主流NFT得到成功的，它获得了其他加密艺术家的支持。\n\n## 6.Pak's Merge : 概念与商业的碰撞\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QstTh7ilS82yoOXBz0vUs.png?height=1164&width=2532)\n\n数字艺术家 Pak 的作品在过去一年中一直畅销，去年12 月初，他的作品 “Merge”将他的市场推向了新的高度。在 12月2日至4日期间，他在Nifty Gateway 上以 9180 万美元的总价售出了 250,000 个“mass units”。\n\n让这次拍卖令人印象深刻的不是它所要求的价格，而是他使用区块链技术创造了一个巨大的概念艺术作品。在售出这些units后，Nifty Gateway将它们铸造为 NFT，合并每个买家的units。例如，购买 100 个批量单位的买家与购买 10,000 个的买家拥有不同的 NFT。而且每次购买Merge NFT 时，它都会与现有的Merge合并，减少NFT数量\\*。\\*\n\nNifty Gateway宣传Pak是最昂贵的在世艺术家，甚至超过Jeff Koons。\n\n## 7.NFT.NYC：步入IRL\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G2hwAEuXO5AcGaG9M9kMB.png?height=1134&width=1752)\n\nNFT.NYC是由Jodee Rich和Cameron Bale早在2018年创立，今年已经进入了第四个年头，他们想将NFT创作者和收藏者聚集在一起，今年涵盖了超过16个领域，包括艺术、摄影、音乐和电影等。本次NFT NYC有超过15,000名与会者注册了会议，而去年这个数字只有5,000左右。\n\nNFT 社区的成员从世界各地飞来，在纽约市与 IRL 会面。NFT 社区庞大而充满活力一直被认为完全是线上的。但NFT.NYC让更多的人看到了NFT的的线下财力，无数的场地被出租给独家和豪华的派对，收藏家、爱好者和更多人一起陶醉于这场NFT盛会。\n\n从CryptoPunks到“Everydays”，NFT正式进入艺术投资市场占有一席之地；从BAYC到MFers到NFT.NYC，归属于holders的商业版权放开，品牌打造方式逐步丰富，NFT影响力从线上转向线下；Artblocks促进生成艺术的繁荣，PAK将概念艺术推向大众视野，Jeff Koons宣布正在筹备自己的NFT，越来越多的艺术家开始进行加密结合的艺术创作。\n\n# 二、艺术NFT发展现状\n\n## 1.艺术NFT项目\n\n艺术品NFT主要分为以下几类，同一个项目可能同时归属于多个类别，这取决于它们在路线图中的哪个阶段。\n\n* **静态艺术**\n\n静态艺术通常是专门从事平面创作的图形艺术家的选择，也是传统艺术家的首选，他们将自己的实体作品制作副本并符号化。在这里，我们将介绍上面提到过的主流拍卖行的NFT拍卖里程碑艺术家——Beeple。\n\n**Beeple**\n\n代表作品：\n\n“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”，在佳士得以 6900 万美元的价格售出。\n\n在“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”中，Beeple将反复出现的主题和配色方案拼接成一个整体。主题包括社会对技术的痴迷和恐惧；对财富的渴望和怨恨；以及美国的政治动荡。\n\n* **GIFs/视频**\n\n除静态NFT外，你还可以经常看到一些GIF和视频NFT作品。GIF和视频可以结合动画和声音，借此艺术家可以创造出融合视觉和听觉体验的沉浸式作品，更深刻的打造作品中的场景。\n\n**XCOPY**\n\nXCOPY 来自伦敦，是一位“长期主义数字艺术家和加密爱好者”，加密艺术界的原生黑帮。作为SuperRare上的原创艺术家，他在Nifty Gateway上大获成功，XCOPY 是 NFT 艺术社区的领导者。\n\nXCOPY 通常专注于类似风格的单版、1-of-1 作品，其中一些作品的标题评论 NFT 文化和/或其他人对它的批评——例如Right Click 和 Save As Guy和All-Time High in the City。随着NFT 市场的增长，这些作品和其他作品的价值越来越高。\n\n今年3月，XCOPY的Max Pain NFT的公开版本在10分钟内以价值2300 万美元售出，这两天Grifters by XCOPY的地板价从10ETH小小的涨到了20ETH，众巨鲸集体晒单，黑帮仍在席卷整个NFT社区。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0MAqERAqkwQ5c3Si9eR4.png?height=810&width=1448)\n\n**Mad Dog Jones**\n\nMad Dog Jones将音乐和艺术结合在一起，创造了符合动态、适应性和超现实概念的艺术作品。他的艺术作品是赛博朋克式的城市建筑或街道场景。他已售出1567件NFT艺术品，平均每件9063.52美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9x3g8i3EeMQWprMLWX5gX.png?height=1282&width=1280)\n\n代表作品：\n\n“REPLICATOR”，以 410 万美元的价格售出。REPLICATOR NFT 项目每 28 天产生新的艺术品。第一代 NFT 产生了六个新的 NFT，六个中的每个产生五个，就像复印机一样，这样的生成会一直持续到第七代，买家最终可以拥有180到220个独特的NFT，每个都可以再次出售产生价值。\n\n“Crash + burn”，以390万美元的价格售出。\n\n* **摄影**\n\n我们经常可以看到网络上的优秀摄影作品，当我们想收藏数字摄影作品时，我们能想到的往往是保存下来或者购买摄影作品集。\n\nNFT的出现让摄影作品可以被直接收藏，上传同时即可为作品进行确权，也可以便于藏家收藏。\n\n**Cath Simard**\n\n代表作品：\n\n“FreeHawaii”， 以100ETH被知名的NFT收藏家Gmoney收藏。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tbqiI_DRvmljscaXmCHKG.png?height=1348&width=1082)\n\n2017年Cath Simard拍摄了一张夏威夷孤独道路的照片。她在Instagram账户上发布后，照片很快被转载盗用但却未被标明原作者，而Simard在多次起诉侵权者后仍无法得到任何金钱赔偿。最终她决定在SuperRare上将这张照片作为NFT来铸造，并在购买后向公众公布照片的使用权。FreeHawaii照片现在是最著名的NFT摄影作品之一。\n\n* **生成艺术**\n\n**Autoglyphs by Larva Labs**\n\nLarva Labs2019年创作的Autoglyphs，加密社区中的许多人认为这是第一个链上生成艺术收藏品。本周价格回弹至300ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dEugdYpvY70m7bmUtr-Pj.png?height=1070&width=1096)\n\n**Artblocks策展系列**\n\n由 Art Blocks 策展委员会批准的收藏。它们最能代表平台的官方愿景，按季度发布。Fidenza、Ringers是让人印象深刻的系列。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lOgLDsm4wSYFpYyLXHgqm.png?height=1090&width=906)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BolRLEgX-mIAhP5BFVKNA.png?height=898&width=894)\n\n* **艺术收藏品**\n\n**Hashmasks**\n\nHashmasks是一个由全球70多位艺术家共同创作的合作性艺术项目，于2021年1月启动，共有16384个独特的Hashmasks。这是 NFT 历史上第一次允许每个收藏品由买家命名的数字艺术收藏品，藏家可以使用空投的NCT代币为收藏品命名，每个收藏品的价值由艺术品的创作者及其消费者共同决定。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UOa2aYVglk4Ia1inEnJFn.png?height=1254&width=894)\n\n总量：16,384\n\n地板价：0.388ETH\n\n持有人数：5.2k\n\n网站：<https://www.thehashmasks.com/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/hashmasks>\n\n**Murakami.Flowers**\n\n艺术家村上隆的代表作品——花卉，以点状艺术的形式表现出来，让人想起 1970 年代创作的日本电视游戏。该作品正在以数字108为关键词进行开发；108个背景和花色组合构成一个字段，有108个字段。每个字段有 108 个花卉图像，总共有 11,664 个花卉图像。数字 108 指的是 bonnō 或世俗的诱惑。将发行游戏、策划线下艺术展、尝试在数字世界中重现日本神山富士山脚下樱花盛开的Metaverse\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FIQpFyk1PBY1hZQb8L8hb.png?height=906&width=896)\n\n。\n\n总量：9.5k\n\n地板价：2.95ETH\n\n持有人数：5.6k\n\n网站：<https://murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/murakami-flowers-2022-official>\n\n**\"MOAR\" by Joan Cornella**\n\n\"MOAR\"是虚拟世界中的一座不同寻常的豪宅，其中 有5,555 个生物的灵魂，这些“和平共处”的人类、机器人甚至僵尸都是独一无二的，由西班牙艺术家 Joan Cornellà 手绘而成。发行后将为藏家空投各种实物周边、豪宅房间，策划”MOAR”展览。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qpdlsWYy-6m1zpyYxV7Ld.png?height=900&width=900)\n\n总量：5.6k\n\n地板价：0.945ETH\n\n持有人数：2.9k\n\n网站：<https://joancornella.fwenclub.com/>\n\nOpensea:<https://opensea.io/collection/official-moar-by-joan-cornella>\n\n**Munko by David Choe**\n\nDavid Choe是位韩裔美籍画家。擅长画人物画，壁画，涂鸦，和连环小说画。David Choe被大众熟知是由于其神奇的天降横财经历，他在Facebook创业阶段为他们进行总部大楼涂鸦，从6万美元和Facebook股票这两种作画酬劳方式中选择了后者。据纽约时报估计，他手头的股票值2亿美元，成为了Facebook十大亿万富翁中最具传奇色彩的一位。\n\nMunko想给大家带来简单地自由地创造和连接的快乐，纯粹的激情、创造和好奇心的vibe是Munko 的特点。藏家可以通过回答一些问题来提交自己的每个人的信息，生成与自己相关的独特Munko。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4yuMEmvrVTd5oKsEPm8Ma.png?height=1170&width=1056)\n\n总量：5.2k\n\n地板价：0.2ETH\n\n持有人数：2.2k\n\n网站：<https://munko.io/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/munko-by-david-choe>\n\n## 2.艺术家社区\n\n### JPG社区\n\n* 介绍：\n\n  jpg.space立志成为加密世界的 Tumblr。用户可以导入和显示 OpenSea上可用的任何 NFT，以策划自己的画廊。他们希望人们从精心策划的画廊中找到价值，NFT已经成为财富聚集的游戏，如果你没有钱你很难在社区中定位自己，他们希望人们可以在NFT世界中发现更多的价值。\n\n  JPG社区是由收藏家、策展人、创作者构成的策展社区，允许每个人创建 NFT 展览。通过信誉系统衡量每个人对策展网络的贡献，发展具有内部声誉系统的去中心化社区。\n* 团队：\n\n  jpg.space由 Fernandez 和联合创始人 Trent Elmore 和 Sam Spike 于 去年7 月推出，在今年1月的种子轮融资中获得 380 万美元。\n* 网站：\n\n  <https://jpg.space/>\n\n### GODA\n\n* 介绍：\n\n  GODA是艺术家与藏家社区，以GODA PASS作为准入门槛。GODA与传统艺术家在数字艺术空间中密切合作，帮助他们在社交媒体传达自己的创作语言。确保合作艺术家无缝、有影响力的投放，尊重他们的艺术价值。对收藏家提供市场上最好的收藏品。\n\n  GODA 团队策划了一个收藏品系列，其中包括来自传统艺术界的知名人物以及GODA的合作艺术家。\n* 团队：\n\n  GODA团队由消费者、艺术、音乐、NFT 和时尚领域知名人士领导。包括：Nina Chanel Abney、Shaun Neff、Pharrell Williams、KAWS等。\n* 网站：\n\n  <https://thegoda.io/>\n\n## 3.艺术NFT市场\n\n**SuperRare**\n\nSuperRare帮助艺术收藏降低门槛，建立一个值得信赖的社区，让艺术家可以直接接触买家。长期以来艺术收藏市场一直是不透明且排他性的市场，大多数人无法进入。SuperRare让数字艺术首次能以大规模公开的方式在线发售。拍卖的每一件作品都经过身份验证，并被标记为任何人都可以拥有和交易的加密收藏数字物品。所有交易均使用以太坊网络上的原生加密货币以太币进行。\n\n近期，SuperRare在纽约 SoHo 区的 417 West Broadway 开设快闪画廊，开启IRL接触的新篇章，现在艺术家们可以和每个人分享观看和感受 NFT 艺术品的体验。\n\n网站：[https://superrare.com/](https://superrare.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com)\n\n**Foundation**\n\nFoundation 是一个去中心化平台，帮助促进NFT的现场拍卖，邀请制加入，吸引了众多1/1创作者的聚集。\n\n网站：<https://foundation.app/>\n\n**Art Blocks**\n\nArt Blocks基于以太坊，是一个能够链上生成艺术品的NFT平台。在Art Blocks中，艺术家上传脚本到以太坊智能合约，生成艺术作品。这些脚本会作为一个系列进行发行，收藏者可以购买限量的脚本，就像NFT一样。这种铸造方式让艺术品脚本拥有独特性，这样除了作品相关的NFT之外，还能产生其他艺术成果，是生成艺术家的首选市场。\n\n网站：<https://www.artblocks.io/>\n\n# 三、未来发展方向\n\nNFT作为一种可以应用于任何数字媒体的技术，在PFP收藏品和游戏领域大放异彩。但我们仍希望看见NFT作为载体如何传递反思性及批判性，以及看到数字艺术的新收藏方式解决传统艺术收藏的痛点。\n\n从JPEG summer可以借鉴的NFT应用场景：\n\n* 艺术x社区：传统收藏中藏家有同样的审美却不知道对方的存在，NFT社区已经验证了具有同样爱好和选择的藏家爆发出的力量足以将一套头像系列打造为一个品牌，这正是艺术的商业化所缺乏的早期忠实藏家群体。\n* 艺术x实用：艺术系列的成功离不开优秀的投资人，NFT将忠实藏家聚集在同一个社区，时间会为藏家筛选出哪些是值得信任且值得投资的艺术系列。Utility承诺了藏家未来的收益，随着Utility的兑现，藏家会更加信任艺术系列的未来发展，保持关注和投资。\n* 艺术x定制：PFP的大肆发行让个人资料图像逐步同质化，同样的Roadmap和类似的画风，藏家需要在市场上看到更加非同质化的NFT作品。Munko这类将艺术与藏家直接挂钩的尝试契合了市场对非同质化的需求。\n* 艺术x实物权益：与实际物品或权益关联会让NFT有根可依，实物周边、非web3的购物优惠、实物权益、展览门票等会让人眼前一亮。\n* 艺术x孵化：开启藏家的力量，共同投资艺术品共同创业，如宪法DAO的共同拍宪法、Web3 Medici帮派进行艺术资助、薯条DAO众筹开实体薯条店。\n\n艺术珍品展示通过藏品线下艺术准备收藏周期、价格；作品时与画廊或单品方面联系，与藏品联系，不收藏常藏家，同位艺术家的展位之间不会产生多藏家动，多款精品展示高要求中极品，极品展品。\n\n而NFT适中，适合中置家收藏，展示在线上档次，策展周期连续，Twitter、价格等社交媒体成为24小时不停歇的个人，策展的工具及小社区正在涌现；展览和展厅价格NFT提供了一个全新的艺术社区，独一无二的获得了更多的艺术界同样的保护，被许多人认可的真情，收藏艺术有自己的资源。让我们一起期待下一个夏天实现。\n\n欢迎交流🕳\n\n推特：@bygogogo\n\n[https://twitter.com/bygogogo](https://twitter.com/bygogogo)\n\n###

{"id": "8B55UQf4GOWtH97hq-ZcVSuYSlUpBTcxX1dOdcDqJZ0", "title": "Will everything go on-chain?", "body": "[Our last post](https://mirror.xyz/0x5B3DaFc35dcf434153B5DF2be2C493Df4403AA75/G_nMiwWU48y3rUmMo4JdmPrStPJDCdHS6SOCRq5FTuE) ended with the question: Is everything going on-chain?\n\nAn economy that is on-chain has the following differences compared to our current economies:\n\n* Composability\n* Transparency\n* Uncensorable\n* Reduced need for trusted third parties\n\nLet’s go through each of these.\n\n**Composability**\n\nSmart-contract blockchains are the first global APIs. Anything that is on-chain follows the same standards that programmers can build on top of. Similarly, every app, wallet, and exchange that wants to interact with these types of assets integrates code that can interact with these standards.\n\nThink about the kind of coordination it would take if you wanted to get insurances, art, tickets, wine bottles, and music all on the same standards. With blockchains you can trade, own, and use all assets using the same apps, wallets, and exchanges. \n\nIn theory it's possible to make a global API without blockchains, but in practice this hasn't happened, and would be impossible to coordinate. Having a fully composable economy reduces friction and unlocks new possibilities for cross-sector applications.\n\n**Transparency and perfect provenance**\n\n[https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1548352845379878912](https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1548352845379878912)\n\nThe blow-up of Luna and Three Arrows Capital was resolved almost instantly on-chain. The ripple effects, or contagion, only became clear days or weeks after these blow-ups happened. Investors had no idea what companies like Celsius and BlockFi were doing with their money and many now have frozen funds on these insolvent platforms.\n\nTransparency is inherent to blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. Anyone with an internet connection can check the data and see a perfect record of the history of every on-chain asset. An on-chain economy is less prone to blow-ups such as the 2008 economic crisis. On the blockchain, there is no way for banks to lend out the same dollar to 10 different companies and socializing the risk to innocent people. Given how much impact the 2008 crisis had on many people’s lives, this benefit is not to be overlooked. \n\n**Uncensorable and provably equal**\n\nBlockchains are agnostic to its users. Anyone can access the data, anyone can send a transaction, and anyone can become a validator.\n\nYou cannot be kicked off the blockchain like you can off Facebook or Twitter (even if you are the president of the United States). You can get a loan and a savings account without experts deeming you worthy enough. The fact that blockchains do not discriminate between users means that people from all over the world will have the exact same economic tools at their disposal as the most powerful people.\n\n**Removing trusted third parties**\n\nOver the last decades we have become increasingly dependent on the internet for our livelihoods, social life, entertainment, and information. The internet is ran by a select group of companies that own all your data and digital assets. Trusted third parties existed before the internet (governments, banks), but our reliance on them has vastly increased as we have transitioned more and more into the digital world.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1443921349676867586](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1443921349676867586)\n\nWith blockchains you trust code, rather than people. The code is open source and can be checked by anyone with the technological know-how. By replacing people with code you make it impossible to cheat, to commit fraud, and to break contracts. Additionally, consumers would actually own their digital assets such as their social media accounts and content, in-game items, and online courses.\n\nThe major benefits of removing trusted third parties are:\n\n* Trusted third parties in the digital world tend to become monopolies. If we move increasingly digital, the world is at risk to be run by a handful of Big Tech companies.\n* Trusted third parties form a single point of failure. Imagine what could happen if the government implements central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their system gets hacked. Or what if a dictator takes over in 10, 20 or 30 years and demands control of Facebook’s Metaverse?\n* Ownership for consumers. It is arguably better to own your assets, than to risk being denied access. If citizens truly own their assets it is impossible for a Justin Trudeau to cut you off the payment system.\n\nEven in a blockchain world, trusted third parties will still exist. There need to be entities that put real-world assets on-chain and regulatory bodies that keep these entities in check. For real-world assets therefore, the main benefit of going on-chain is efficiency. For intangible goods and digitally native assets, we can now just trust the code.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\nThere are so many benefits to putting our economy on-chain. If assets are composable, globally accessible, uncensorable, and all of that with true ownership, the economy would get rid of many market inefficiencies. It will become easier to buy and sell virtually any good, to proof who owns what, [to own culture](https://mirror.xyz/0x5B3DaFc35dcf434153B5DF2be2C493Df4403AA75/G_nMiwWU48y3rUmMo4JdmPrStPJDCdHS6SOCRq5FTuE), and to ensure people follow the rules (cheating is not possible on-chain). I envision that everyone will have hundreds or thousands of NFTs in their wallets, ranging from sneakers and tickets to art and diplomas. The benefits of having these assets represented as NFTs and connected to the rest of the on-chain economy will be too great to not do it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KDZNRcDISyFhZC6C1Jc5l.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\nBlockchains enforce values such as equality of opportunity, truth, transparency, and autonomy. I think a society that runs on blockchains will be significantly more democratic. In my mind, the alternative is a world ran by a handful of Big Tech companies, that could be taken over by governments like China or the USA at any moment. This issue will become especially important as we move to augmented and virtual reality and technology becomes even more embedded into our lives.\n\nMany challenges remain before we can have our on-chain economy. We need to onboard billions of users, have simple methods for keeping your assets secure, reduce the possibility of human error (sending to wrong address), and we need to speed up the technology and lower transaction costs. Lastly, the biggest of challenge of all is regulation. I am convinced that a fully functional blockchain-based economy would benefit >99.99% of the world. However, the winners of the old system and people that misunderstand blockchains, will prefer having centralized systems win out. The regulatory battle is one that we must win to protect our freedom. If we do, I think almost every asset will go on-chain. This would give us more freedom and could unlock a new wave of human creativity.\n\nps. thanks to [@punk6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529) for many great insights.

2.Beeple：著名拍卖行提供NFT\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QmRhxVrfFKwQo6gWhc1xH.png?height=946&width=1570)\n\nBeeple从20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000万美元每天：最初的500天时，一切都变了，天价使他成为世界上世界的在世，000天。\n\nNFT 的出现有一次让 NFT 有一次明显的印象中出现的可能，但它的第一个市场就为 NFT 带来了一次支持，在下有让 NFT 成为大众互联网的热门话题。 会的大众视野，可能但就可以进入流行的互联网热点。\n\n佳士艺术得关注专家亚戴维斯最重要的说：“当时正有可能是我们会发生的变化，吸引我们年轻家的东西完全改变，转变和时代变成了这样的事情”。\n\n这些标的标标者标标总数为33位标标标标者，有91%的标标标标者参与了标标标标平台（58%）标标标标标标者超过千代（1981年）年-1966年），他们增长于信息科技诞生的，还有3%为出生于1965年至1980年，而“婴儿潮世代”（出生于1946—1964年）的标号为3%，数量为Z世代（出生于1995-2009年）很显然，NFT成为了和Z世代家最重要的关键。\n\n###

7.NFT.NYC：步入IRL\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G2hwAEuXO5AcGaG9M9kMB.png?height=1134&width=1752)\n\nNFT.NYC是由Jodee Rich和Cameron Bale早在2018年创立，今年已经进入了第四个年头，他们想将NFT创作者和收藏者聚集在一起，今年涵盖了超过16个领域，包括艺术、摄影、音乐和电影等。本次NFT NYC有超过15,000名与会者注册了会议，而去年这个数字只有5,000左右。\n\nNFT 社区的成员从世界各地飞来，在纽约市与 IRL 会面。NFT 社区庞大而充满活力一直被认为完全是线上的。但NFT.NYC让更多的人看到了NFT的的线下财力，无数的场地被出租给独家和豪华的派对，收藏家、爱好者和更多人一起陶醉于这场NFT盛会。\n\n从CryptoPunks到“Everydays”，NFT正式进入艺术投资市场占有一席之地；从BAYC到MFers到NFT.NYC，归属于holders的商业版权放开，品牌打造方式逐步丰富，NFT影响力从线上转向线下；Artblocks促进生成艺术的繁荣，PAK将概念艺术推向大众视野，Jeff Koons宣布正在筹备自己的NFT，越来越多的艺术家开始进行加密结合的艺术创作。\n\n# 二、艺术NFT发展现状\n\n## 1.艺术NFT项目\n\n艺术品NFT主要分为以下几类，同一个项目可能同时归属于多个类别，这取决于它们在路线图中的哪个阶段。\n\n* **静态艺术**\n\n静态艺术通常是专门从事平面创作的图形艺术家的选择，也是传统艺术家的首选，他们将自己的实体作品制作副本并符号化。在这里，我们将介绍上面提到过的主流拍卖行的NFT拍卖里程碑艺术家——Beeple。\n\n**Beeple**\n\n代表作品：\n\n“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”，在佳士得以 6900 万美元的价格售出。\n\n在“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”中，Beeple将反复出现的主题和配色方案拼接成一个整体。主题包括社会对技术的痴迷和恐惧；对财富的渴望和怨恨；以及美国的政治动荡。\n\n* **GIFs/视频**\n\n除静态NFT外，你还可以经常看到一些GIF和视频NFT作品。GIF和视频可以结合动画和声音，借此艺术家可以创造出融合视觉和听觉体验的沉浸式作品，更深刻的打造作品中的场景。\n\n**XCOPY**\n\nXCOPY 来自伦敦，是一位“长期主义数字艺术家和加密爱好者”，加密艺术界的原生黑帮。作为SuperRare上的原创艺术家，他在Nifty Gateway上大获成功，XCOPY 是 NFT 艺术社区的领导者。\n\nXCOPY 通常专注于类似风格的单版、1-of-1 作品，其中一些作品的标题评论 NFT 文化和/或其他人对它的批评——例如Right Click 和 Save As Guy和All-Time High in the City。随着NFT 市场的增长，这些作品和其他作品的价值越来越高。\n\n今年3月，XCOPY的Max Pain NFT的公开版本在10分钟内以价值2300 万美元售出，这两天Grifters by XCOPY的地板价从10ETH小小的涨到了20ETH，众巨鲸集体晒单，黑帮仍在席卷整个NFT社区。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0MAqERAqkwQ5c3Si9eR4.png?height=810&width=1448)\n\n**Mad Dog Jones**\n\nMad Dog Jones将音乐和艺术结合在一起，创造了符合动态、适应性和超现实概念的艺术作品。他的艺术作品是赛博朋克式的城市建筑或街道场景。他已售出1567件NFT艺术品，平均每件9063.52美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9x3g8i3EeMQWprMLWX5gX.png?height=1282&width=1280)\n\n代表作品：\n\n“REPLICATOR”，以 410 万美元的价格售出。REPLICATOR NFT 项目每 28 天产生新的艺术品。第一代 NFT 产生了六个新的 NFT，六个中的每个产生五个，就像复印机一样，这样的生成会一直持续到第七代，买家最终可以拥有180到220个独特的NFT，每个都可以再次出售产生价值。\n\n“Crash + burn”，以390万美元的价格售出。\n\n* **摄影**\n\n我们经常可以看到网络上的优秀摄影作品，当我们想收藏数字摄影作品时，我们能想到的往往是保存下来或者购买摄影作品集。\n\nNFT的出现让摄影作品可以被直接收藏，上传同时即可为作品进行确权，也可以便于藏家收藏。\n\n**Cath Simard**\n\n代表作品：\n\n“FreeHawaii”， 以100ETH被知名的NFT收藏家Gmoney收藏。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tbqiI_DRvmljscaXmCHKG.png?height=1348&width=1082)\n\n2017年Cath Simard拍摄了一张夏威夷孤独道路的照片。她在Instagram账户上发布后，照片很快被转载盗用但却未被标明原作者，而Simard在多次起诉侵权者后仍无法得到任何金钱赔偿。最终她决定在SuperRare上将这张照片作为NFT来铸造，并在购买后向公众公布照片的使用权。FreeHawaii照片现在是最著名的NFT摄影作品之一。\n\n* **生成艺术**\n\n**Autoglyphs by Larva Labs**\n\nLarva Labs2019年创作的Autoglyphs，加密社区中的许多人认为这是第一个链上生成艺术收藏品。本周价格回弹至300ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dEugdYpvY70m7bmUtr-Pj.png?height=1070&width=1096)\n\n**Artblocks策展系列**\n\n由 Art Blocks 策展委员会批准的收藏。它们最能代表平台的官方愿景，按季度发布。Fidenza、Ringers是让人印象深刻的系列。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lOgLDsm4wSYFpYyLXHgqm.png?height=1090&width=906)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BolRLEgX-mIAhP5BFVKNA.png?height=898&width=894)\n\n* **艺术收藏品**\n\n**Hashmasks**\n\nHashmasks是一个由全球70多位艺术家共同创作的合作性艺术项目，于2021年1月启动，共有16384个独特的Hashmasks。这是 NFT 历史上第一次允许每个收藏品由买家命名的数字艺术收藏品，藏家可以使用空投的NCT代币为收藏品命名，每个收藏品的价值由艺术品的创作者及其消费者共同决定。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UOa2aYVglk4Ia1inEnJFn.png?height=1254&width=894)\n\n总量：16,384\n\n地板价：0.388ETH\n\n持有人数：5.2k\n\n网站：<https://www.thehashmasks.com/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/hashmasks>\n\n**Murakami.Flowers**\n\n艺术家村上隆的代表作品——花卉，以点状艺术的形式表现出来，让人想起 1970 年代创作的日本电视游戏。该作品正在以数字108为关键词进行开发；108个背景和花色组合构成一个字段，有108个字段。每个字段有 108 个花卉图像，总共有 11,664 个花卉图像。数字 108 指的是 bonnō 或世俗的诱惑。将发行游戏、策划线下艺术展、尝试在数字世界中重现日本神山富士山脚下樱花盛开的Metaverse\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FIQpFyk1PBY1hZQb8L8hb.png?height=906&width=896)\n\n。\n\n总量：9.5k\n\n地板价：2.95ETH\n\n持有人数：5.6k\n\n网站：<https://murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/murakami-flowers-2022-official>\n\n**\"MOAR\"

手绘而成。发行后将为藏家空投各种实物周边、豪宅房间，策划”MOAR”展览。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qpdlsWYy-6m1zpyYxV7Ld.png?height=900&width=900)\n\n总量：5.6k\n\n地板价：0.945ETH\n\n持有人数：2.9k\n\n网站：<https://joancornella.fwenclub.com/>\n\nOpensea:<https://opensea.io/collection/official-moar-by-joan-cornella>\n\n**Munko by David Choe**\n\nDavid Choe是位韩裔美籍画家。擅长画人物画，壁画，涂鸦，和连环小说画。David Choe被大众熟知是由于其神奇的天降横财经历，他在Facebook创业阶段为他们进行总部大楼涂鸦，从6万美元和Facebook股票这两种作画酬劳方式中选择了后者。据纽约时报估计，他手头的股票值2亿美元，成为了Facebook十大亿万富翁中最具传奇色彩的一位。\n\nMunko想给大家带来简单地自由地创造和连接的快乐，纯粹的激情、创造和好奇心的vibe是Munko 的特点。藏家可以通过回答一些问题来提交自己的每个人的信息，生成与自己相关的独特Munko。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4yuMEmvrVTd5oKsEPm8Ma.png?height=1170&width=1056)\n\n总量：5.2k\n\n地板价：0.2ETH\n\n持有人数：2.2k\n\n网站：<https://munko.io/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/munko-by-david-choe>\n\n## 2.艺术家社区\n\n### JPG社区\n\n* 介绍：\n\n  jpg.space立志成为加密世界的 Tumblr。用户可以导入和显示 OpenSea上可用的任何 NFT，以策划自己的画廊。他们希望人们从精心策划的画廊中找到价值，NFT已经成为财富聚集的游戏，如果你没有钱你很难在社区中定位自己，他们希望人们可以在NFT世界中发现更多的价值。\n\n  JPG社区是由收藏家、策展人、创作者构成的策展社区，允许每个人创建 NFT 展览。通过信誉系统衡量每个人对策展网络的贡献，发展具有内部声誉系统的去中心化社区。\n* 团队：\n\n  jpg.space由 Fernandez 和联合创始人 Trent Elmore 和 Sam Spike 于 去年7 月推出，在今年1月的种子轮融资中获得 380 万美元。\n* 网站：\n\n  <https://jpg.space/>\n\n### GODA\n\n* 介绍：\n\n  GODA是艺术家与藏家社区，以GODA PASS作为准入门槛。GODA与传统艺术家在数字艺术空间中密切合作，帮助他们在社交媒体传达自己的创作语言。确保合作艺术家无缝、有影响力的投放，尊重他们的艺术价值。对收藏家提供市场上最好的收藏品。\n\n  GODA 团队策划了一个收藏品系列，其中包括来自传统艺术界的知名人物以及GODA的合作艺术家。\n* 团队：\n\n  GODA团队由消费者、艺术、音乐、NFT 和时尚领域知名人士领导。包括：Nina Chanel Abney、Shaun Neff、Pharrell Williams、KAWS等。\n* 网站：\n\n  <https://thegoda.io/>\n\n## 3.艺术NFT市场\n\n**SuperRare**\n\nSuperRare帮助艺术收藏降低门槛，建立一个值得信赖的社区，让艺术家可以直接接触买家。长期以来艺术收藏市场一直是不透明且排他性的市场，大多数人无法进入。SuperRare让数字艺术首次能以大规模公开的方式在线发售。拍卖的每一件作品都经过身份验证，并被标记为任何人都可以拥有和交易的加密收藏数字物品。所有交易均使用以太坊网络上的原生加密货币以太币进行。\n\n近期，SuperRare在纽约 SoHo 区的 417 West Broadway 开设快闪画廊，开启IRL接触的新篇章，现在艺术家们可以和每个人分享观看和感受 NFT 艺术品的体验。\n\n网站：[https://superrare.com/](https://superrare.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com)\n\n**Foundation**\n\nFoundation 是一个去中心化平台，帮助促进NFT的现场拍卖，邀请制加入，吸引了众多1/1创作者的聚集。\n\n网站：<https://foundation.app/>\n\n**Art Blocks**\n\nArt Blocks基于以太坊，是一个能够链上生成艺术品的NFT平台。在Art Blocks中，艺术家上传脚本到以太坊智能合约，生成艺术作品。这些脚本会作为一个系列进行发行，收藏者可以购买限量的脚本，就像NFT一样。这种铸造方式让艺术品脚本拥有独特性，这样除了作品相关的NFT之外，还能产生其他艺术成果，是生成艺术家的首选市场。\n\n网站：<https://www.artblocks.io/>\n\n# 三、未来发展方向\n\nNFT作为一种可以应用于任何数字媒体的技术，在PFP收藏品和游戏领域大放异彩。但我们仍希望看见NFT作为载体如何传递反思性及批判性，以及看到数字艺术的新收藏方式解决传统艺术收藏的痛点。\n\n从JPEG summer可以借鉴的NFT应用场景：\n\n* 艺术x社区：传统收藏中藏家有同样的审美却不知道对方的存在，NFT社区已经验证了具有同样爱好和选择的藏家爆发出的力量足以将一套头像系列打造为一个品牌，这正是艺术的商业化所缺乏的早期忠实藏家群体。\n* 艺术x实用：艺术系列的成功离不开优秀的投资人，NFT将忠实藏家聚集在同一个社区，时间会为藏家筛选出哪些是值得信任且值得投资的艺术系列。Utility承诺了藏家未来的收益，随着Utility的兑现，藏家会更加信任艺术系列的未来发展，保持关注和投资。\n* 艺术x定制：PFP的大肆发行让个人资料图像逐步同质化，同样的Roadmap和类似的画风，藏家需要在市场上看到更加非同质化的NFT作品。Munko这类将艺术与藏家直接挂钩的尝试契合了市场对非同质化的需求。\n* 艺术x实物权益：与实际物品或权益关联会让NFT有根可依，实物周边、非web3的购物优惠、实物权益、展览门票等会让人眼前一亮。\n* 艺术x孵化：开启藏家的力量，共同投资艺术品共同创业，如宪法DAO的共同拍宪法、Web3 Medici帮派进行艺术资助、薯条DAO众筹开实体薯条店。\n\n艺术珍藏品线下艺术准备周期、价格；作品时与展览或单品方面联系，不收藏常藏家，同藏作品多藏品通过展位之间，不会多款作品精品展示高要求中极品，极品展品。\n\n而 NFT 适中，适合中置家收藏，策展周期连续，推特、价格等的社交媒体成为 24 小时不停歇的个人，工具及小社区正在提供现时；展览和展厅价格 NFT一个全新的艺术社区，独一无二的资源获得了更多的艺术界同样的真实保护，被许多人认可的情怀，收藏有自己的。让我们一起期待下一个夏天的实现。\n\n欢迎交流🕳\n\n推特：@bygogogo\n\n[https://twitter.com/bygogogo](https://twitter.com/bygogogo)\n\n###

{"id": "8MqzyXicKxWmFsT2SzrPDrqqcuu65f4Xp2aUPrqIms0", "title": "794 Days of Water: A Sobriety Story", "body": "On December 28th, 2017, at 26 years old, I went sober. In my first year, I was resilient in my committment to confront myself and grateful for those who supported me. Now, with the fog lifted from over my hindsight, I recognize those same people are the ones I hurt when drinking, and I owe them apologies.\n\n*That’s weird, I thought I finished the glass of water before I went to bed.*\n\nI thought to myself as I woke to damp bedsheets.\n\n*I must have fallen asleep before I finished it and knocked it over during the night.*\n\n*Let me check.*\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI peed the bed.\n\n•\n\nI wish that this was a cute story from the archives of my childhood but it’s not.\n\nThis was me at 26, waking up in a bed in my childhood room at my parent's house.\n\nHere I was, on a Sunday morning carrying bedsheets past my parents, who were waiting to have family breakfast with me, downstairs to wash.\n\nI was 26, hungover, and living with my parents.\n\nThey didn’t say anything, but looking back I can’t begin to imagine the humiliation or concern they had for me.\n\nThis wasn’t an exclusive event either. This was also me at 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25.\n\nThis was me.\n\n*Was.*\n\nThis isn’t me today. It’s been 794 days since going sober, and in the 2 years of this sober journey, a fog has lifted from over my hindsight allowing me to remember and reflect on moments like this.\n\nIn those two years, I’ve often thought to myself ***“How do you advocate for an adjustment of attitudes and values with integrity if you have previously abused and been complicit in advancing them?”*** \n\nThe commitment that I’ve sentenced myself to is to be radically truthful in sharing my past so that others with parallel experiences find solidarity or become made aware of their options, and so that younger generations now entering the phase of life that has visibly scarred me are presented with alternate role models to those who are being broadcasted across televisions, airwaves, and social media accounts.\n\nI’ve found that with writing, writers either write to relate or to educate. Here, I aim to intersect the two, first offering tales one might relate to, and then ones that will educate against the incorrect assignment I gave to alcohol for a decade of my life.\n\nOn the first anniversary of my sobriety, I published *[Last Year I Drank Tequila](https://mirror.xyz/rickieticklez.eth/jr7EuoLmw8IP6JLHOS8x_BQ2m7ApFS1-QDsmrAbXm3U),* which dug into the reasons why I drank. I confronted the harm I was doing to myself (*physically, mentally, and emotionally)* and being done to my dreams. In that year, cliche as it is, I began to really understand the idea that in order to love others, we need to love ourselves first, and that to change the world we need to change ourselves first. It was hard work, private work, and I am grateful for those who supported my decision.\n\nIn year two, more secure in my relationship with alcohol, I’ve confronted the harm I’ve done to others. Harm, manifesting in others as emotional pain, worry, stress, anxiety, anger, and taking the steps to repent for and correct it.\n\nAll relationships don’t need to return to their former state, but for those who brought them pain, they must at some point have the courage to own their past conduct and begin a process of correction.\n\nThat’s what the past 365 days have been for me.\n\nThis process has returned me to friendships, revisited adventures, resurfaced memories and stories that I’ll cherish forever but also reached back to confront past pain, traumas, and humiliations of myself and those around me.\n\nWhat’s become clear now that the fog has lifted is that no matter how great a chapter of my life was, knowing that it caused pain to others, even if a small fraction, is painful, and I’m not willing to dismiss what I did to others because of how embarrassing and humbling confronting it would be.\n\n**Welcome to year 2.**\n\nI have 19 cousins, 16 of whom are younger than me. Growing up, all my cousins on the Italian side of my family shared a summer house, and as my hockey career developed, the Irish side of my family and I bonded over sport. My grandma came to every game, and most of my cousins began playing themselves.\n\nThey’d wear my number. They’d look up to me. It was a responsibility I welcomed.\n\nIn reflection, I think about what I communicated to them. Not in post-game interactions, or over summer ice cream, but in my actions, my lifestyle. On one hand, my athletic and academic success set a great example, but this exercise isn’t about praise, it’s about truth, and ignoring the dust-covered embarrassments would be irresponsible.\n\nIn summers, I’d rush to Harwich Port, a town on Cape Cod where the family house was, every Friday night for a weekend drinking affair. After early release from internships or training, I’d race down to arrive in time for a quick meal, shower, and round of shots before going to a local bar with friends. Saturday morning started with a quick sweat, then mimosas, beach Coronas, beach naps, beach sunburns, and a beach buzz all leading into a carbon copy of the night before.\n\nOn the surface, it was just a bunch of fun, but the truth was that I was engaging in the excess consumption of alcohol on a regular basis. That’s abuse.\n\nBut, with these decisions, I was communicating something else.\n\nI wasn’t the only one at the house on those weekends. Beside me were 8 younger cousins, who, as cousins do, looked up to me, and what they saw was a person giving alcohol value. The same way I looked up to my former high-school teammates that offered me my first beer, and my role models in professional sports that used alcohol to celebrate victory, I had assigned an inappropriate value on the act of consuming alcohol.\n\nToday, I’d much rather place that value on a bike ride, a panel, on education, or meditation than what I did then.\n\nI can’t rewind and erase the tapes of my young adulthood and that’s what’s so painful. All I can do today is to write new pages so that when my biography is finished, those years are merely a chapter, not an entire book.\n\nAnd you can expect me to dedicate that book to my family.\n\nIt would read short and just say *I am grateful.*\n\nI am grateful for their love and support, and I am grateful for their compassion and forgiveness.\n\nDuring this year of reflection, I think of the pain, manifested as worry, embarrassment, or concern, I brought to them.\n\nI think back to a time with my sister in Prague, Czech Republic. It was February 2014. I was living in Briançon, France and we had a week off during the season. I told my cousin and sister about this and we decided to plan a trip. We chose Prague.\n\nPrague in the winter is pretty and inexpensive. We stayed at a hostel in the old town, went on pub crawls, saw the sights, it was a fucking blast. Until our final night.\n\nWe sipped screwdrivers outside the famous Astronomical Clock all day and at sunset, my sister and cousin wanted to grab a few souvenirs before the markets closed. I decided to stay. I decided to keep drinking. I asked the waiter, or waitress, I can’t remember, for a pen and began to doodle on a napkin. After some time I drew a lock, then an open lock, and then an open lock that melted into the word fiction. I sent a picture of it to a friend back home and told him I was going to get it tattooed on my body. He told me I was a fucking idiot, that I was drunk, and it would be a shitty tattoo. I decided against the lock, but a few minutes later I paid our bill and went to find a tattoo parlor.\n\nNow, keep in mind my sister, cousin, and I all had American phone plans and I was supposed to stay at the restaurant. I found a tattoo parlor, had a few more drinks and decided to get a 5 x 6-inch pirate tattoo on my leg. Aside from the fact that it’s just a terribly done tattoo, I had not told my sister where I was, so when I got on wifi and responded to her expired “*Where are you*” and “*???*” texts with the word “*Alley*”, you can imagine the acute anxiety I gave her. I eventually shared the address with the help of the receptionist and when my sister walked in, I realized I had broken our trust. Not only did I go rogue in a foreign country, but I sent her down an alley to find me pantless with a blue pirate on my thigh.\n\n“*Is this safe? Are those needles clean? What the fuck Richie?*” were all extremely valid questions that I didn’t know the answer to. Nor did I care. I thought what I was doing was the definition of being wild.\n\nIt’s moments like this, where I expressed no concern for anyone but myself, that in reflection humiliate me and confirm that I owe people apologies.\n\nI think back to my parents, and an Easter brunch where I stood on the chairs of a table seating all my relatives, grandparents included, and took swigs from a Grey Goose bottle in front of cousins who were as young as four. Granted, it was during a game of Cards Against Humanity, but there’s a difference between mature, possibly offside jokes, and just being an asshole.\n\nI was being an asshole, and it was at the expense of my parents’ embarrassment. The car ride home was silent and all I could think was “How did they not have a fun time today?”\n\nClaiming oblivion would be inaccurate and admitting my ignorance doesn’t absolve me. Neither does taking responsibility without intentional actions to correct these misbehaviors.\n\nWith family, my motivation to repent for myself is not for forgiveness, but with the hope that my errors can be used as an example for my cousins as they enter into the years of their lives where I chose harmful influences.\n\nAnd I choose to share this publicly because this exists outside the privacy of my family unit as well.\n\nToday, there are many young men maturing in environments saturated with the glorification of substance abuse and machismo and womanizing tendencies, that will claim these impressionable young men as victims should they subscribe to this narrative. A narrative that ultimately will create more victims as a result of the behaviors of these men. So, I want to offer an alternate example.\n\nTo these young men, I understand the desire to be liked by your peers, especially during a time rampant with bullying, but as someone who was *actually* Captain Fucking America, I want you to know that this — the above lifestyle — is for such a temporary applause in a popularity contest, that inviting harm to yourself and those around you is not worth it.\n\nTo add, it’s important to identify how one arrives here. White men are born into privilege. It’s with this privilege I was able to become an Ivy-league athlete, where I then had an opportunity to invest in equity or abuse. During the years of my life where I consumed alcohol, I abused this privilege and the sooner we identify this, the sooner we can invest in correcting it.\n\nIf my example can be used as an opportunity to erect change and educate on the misdirection of abuses, I’m all in.\n\nIn college, I met someone that I had an interest in and they told me I had a warning label. At the time, I wore this with honor. It must mean I was a bad-boy, the younger brother to the *wild* I evolved into.\n\nAt least that’s how I interpreted it. I was selectively oblivious to the truth behind this suggestion that I had caused pain to someone or someones.\n\nI binge drank during college and subscribed to a culture that assigned incorrect value to men who exhibited pseudo-alpha type tendencies of womanizing and substance consumption.\n\nMy habits and glorification of this lifestyle ruined relationships. Out of respect for those involved, there is no need to share details, all you need to know is that I was wrong.\n\nThis has been the silent pain of year 2. I allowed myself to hurt people that I cared about so much, and what’s worse is why I did it. I thought I would gain popularity and increase my social status for engaging in these behaviors.\n\n**Human lives and emotions are too valuable to fuck with.** And I did.\n\nToday, sobriety has granted me the ability to live and love with such intention that I am able to infuse my relationships with authenticity, integrity, and pure love.\n\nYear 2 has been about taking responsibility, and writing this is a step in that direction, even if at a reduced speed. Of these relationships, there are still some I have yet to apologize to. I’ve convinced myself that reaching out after 5 years would just be picking at the scars their scabs healed into. Or, that it would be selfish of me to ask them to revisit the emotional pain I caused them in order to repent for my transgressions, only for me to feel better about myself. Am I even being narcissistic to think that I was important enough to have caused long-lasting pain? I’m active on social media, it’s easy to privately check-in on someone, and I’ve made the judgment that they’re happy now. Why would I want to disturb them?\n\nI know what I need to do, and relying only on publishing admissions would be a repeat of cowardly behavior and too impersonal.\n\nApologies are coming.\n\nThis warning label wasn’t just reserved for romantic relationships either, this infected my friendships too. During my sophomore year, I learned I wasn’t invited to a friend’s birthday party out of fear of how I would behave. At the time, I was upset at the lack of invitation, but also flattered that I was viewed as this wild guy. It’s as if I was the equivalent of a bad-boy Clark Kent. I embraced this “warning” label persona so much that I even printed one out and taped it to my shirt one night before going out. A night out that, on occasion, ended up with me convincing friends I was *fine to drive* putting us all at risk.\n\nIt even infected relationships with my coach who I’d seek out at college tailgates to say hi to, knowing he was with his family. Is that really the type of player a coach wants representing their team or school?\n\nThat’s fucking embarrassing to type out. And no, not embarrassing in the way that owning a white Ed Hardy belt during your freshman year is, but embarrassing that I wholeheartedly believed this to be a good thing.\n\nUnzipping myself from this identity has been a years long process with the hardest being this last since there was nothing but the truth derived from reflections staring directly at my skin in the mirror.\n\nI don’t wish scraped knees and elbows from crawling through rock bottom on anyone, rather I hope others will be inspired to have the courage to confront who they are, who they have been, and who they want to become.\n\nFor me, that exercise exposed a poor relationship with alcohol.\n\nI wasn’t sure what I was going to write on this soberversary, I just knew I wanted to write about it. Mostly for myself. What came out during writing sessions was a painful vomit of embarrassments that, when disinfected, found shape. This needed to be more than an admission, this needed to be an apology. Too often, we prematurely congratulate those who accept responsibility for repeated offenses prior to a complete process. What this protects is the failure to correct behavior. Apologies are incomplete without a corrected course. Cry wolf.\n\nI’ve only ever attended one AA meeting but this essay would be a combination of step 5, admitting to ourselves and others the very nature of our wrongs, and then lead into steps 8 and 9, where we identify who we have wronged, become willing to make amends, and then make amends.\n\nThe word “wrongs” is heavy and can have exclusionary implications. Last year I shied away from the word “sober”, aware of the stigma that it carried with it. I still held this elitist attitude that I wasn’t like *them.* This was reinforced by a former mentor who advised me never to tell anyone in business I was sober, because it would communicate instability. That was wrong, my sobriety is a strength.\n\nToday, I embrace the word. Sober means not affected by alcohol; not drunk. You don’t have to arrive at sobriety from tragedy, or even have had to consume alcohol to be sober. Most don’t understand alcoholism as a spectrum populated with sobriety, casual consumption, misuse, problem drinkers, and abuse. In an effort to update stigmas and attitudes, you’ll hear the word alcohol-use-disorder. It’s a little softer, and it’s quite common.\n\nConsider the conversation on the front lines. A person is considered to have an alcohol-use-disorder when drinking interferes with their work or home life, damages important relationships or their health, and continues despite legal troubles and other serious consequences. It also has to do with problems controlling your consumption. With that, how could I dismiss myself from the conversation?\n\nIf an argument ever happened when drinking, alcohol was interfering with that relationship. If one has ever blacked-out, peed the bed, fallen when drunk, or vomited, then alcohol was interfering with their health. And, if a person ever returned to drinking after that, let’s call it what it is. The barrier to entry for classifications of alcohol-use-disorder is quite low, and for a long time, I refused to accept this. I wasn’t *them.*\n\nWhat I was, was wrong.\n\nI don’t write that to shame anyone, only to bring equity to the conversation, and inform a curious mind that their self-disqualification from the conversation after checking the boxes above is incorrect. I did that for years, and I regret it.\n\nBut 794 days ago the regret became too painful to dismiss, and that’s when *this* all started.\n\nI miss Moscow mules.\n\nI miss being wine drunk at 2 pm on a spring Saturday.\n\nI miss bottomless brunches, 10 person dinners, and ordering 20 shots at a time when I only have 4 friends with me in an attempt to attract and engage a crowd.\n\nI was good at drinking.\n\nBut, I don’t miss wasting days of my life, I don’t miss knowing I had a negative effect on another person’s life, and I don’t miss the pain I brought onto myself.\n\nHi, my name is Richie. I am 28, wild and sober, and I am here to normalize sobriety.\n\n\\-\n\n`Every year, I reflect on the previous 365 days of my sobriety with a Soberversary piece. Each Soberversary piece is published as a collectable NFT with a quantity of 26 to celebrate the age at which I chose sobriety. The price of each NFT set in hundredths of 1 ETH, equal to the Soberversary number being reflected on.`", "timestamp": 1658066978, "digest": "2rusniXpSnngZAV-gaNk_v69XcrO06hbKjoGiYXYDHs", "contributor": "0xF7bcCC29ae64F761A887eFc486Bcbd2d54209620"}

Anything that is on-chain follows the same standards that programmers can build on top of. Similarly, every app, wallet, and exchange that wants to interact with these types of assets integrates code that can interact with these standards.\n\nThink about the kind of coordination it would take if you wanted to get insurances, art, tickets, wine bottles, and music all on the same standards. With blockchains you can trade, own, and use all assets using the same apps, wallets, and exchanges.\n\nIn theory it's possible to make a global API without blockchains, but in practice this hasn't happened, and would be impossible to coordinate. Having a fully composable economy reduces friction and unlocks new possibilities for cross-sector applications.\n\n**Transparency and perfect provenance**\n\n[https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1548352845379878912](https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1548352845379878912)\n\nThe blow-up of Luna and Three Arrows Capital was resolved almost instantly on-chain. The ripple effects, or contagion, only became clear days or weeks after these blow-ups happened. Investors had no idea what companies like Celsius and BlockFi were doing with their money and many now have frozen funds on these insolvent platforms.\n\nTransparency is inherent to blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. Anyone with an internet connection can check the data and see a perfect record of the history of every on-chain asset. An on-chain economy is less prone to blow-ups such as the 2008 economic crisis. On the blockchain, there is no way for banks to lend out the same dollar to 10 different companies and socializing the risk to innocent people. Given how much impact the 2008 crisis had on many people’s lives, this benefit is not to be overlooked.\n\n**Uncensorable and provably equal**\n\nBlockchains are agnostic to its users. Anyone can access the data, anyone can send a transaction, and anyone can become a validator.\n\nYou cannot be kicked off the blockchain like you can off Facebook or Twitter (even if you are the president of the United States). You can get a loan and a savings account without experts deeming you worthy enough. The fact that blockchains do not discriminate between users means that people from all over the world will have the exact same economic tools at their disposal as the most powerful people.\n\n**Removing trusted third parties**\n\nOver the last decades we have become increasingly dependent on the internet for our livelihoods, social life, entertainment, and information. The internet is ran by a select group of companies that own all your data and digital assets. Trusted third parties existed before the internet (governments, banks), but our reliance on them has vastly increased as we have transitioned more and more into the digital world.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1443921349676867586](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1443921349676867586)\n\nWith blockchains you trust code, rather than people. The code is open source and can be checked by anyone with the technological know-how. By replacing people with code you make it impossible to cheat, to commit fraud, and to break contracts. Additionally, consumers would actually own their digital assets such as their social media accounts and content, in-game items, and online courses.\n\nThe major benefits of removing trusted third parties are:\n\n* Trusted third parties in the digital world tend to become monopolies. If we move increasingly digital, the world is at risk to be run by a handful of Big Tech companies.\n* Trusted third parties form a single point of failure. Imagine what could happen if the government implements central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their system gets hacked. Or what if a dictator takes over in 10, 20 or 30 years and demands control of Facebook’s Metaverse?\n* Ownership for consumers. It is arguably better to own your assets, than to risk being denied access. If citizens truly own their assets it is impossible for a Justin Trudeau to cut you off the payment system.\n\nEven in a blockchain world, trusted third parties will still exist. There need to be entities that put real-world assets on-chain and regulatory bodies that keep these entities in check. For real-world assets therefore, the main benefit of going on-chain is efficiency. For intangible goods and digitally native assets, we can now just trust the code.\n\nA last key point is that when we trust blockchains instead of third parties we can build systems enforced by blockchains rather than states. [This means that we may even be able to start countries around cryptographic truth](https://1729.com).\n\n[https://twitter.com/zerox_wes/status/1546840335187415040](https://twitter.com/zerox_wes/status/1546840335187415040)\n\n**Synthesis**\n\nThere are so many benefits to putting our economy on-chain. If assets are composable, globally accessible, uncensorable, and all of that with true ownership, the economy would get rid of many market inefficiencies. It will become easier to buy and sell virtually any good, to proof who owns what, [to own culture](https://mirror.xyz/0x5B3DaFc35dcf434153B5DF2be2C493Df4403AA75/G_nMiwWU48y3rUmMo4JdmPrStPJDCdHS6SOCRq5FTuE), and to ensure people follow the rules (cheating is not possible on-chain). I envision that everyone will have hundreds or thousands of NFTs in their wallets, ranging from sneakers and tickets to art and diplomas. The benefits of having these assets represented as NFTs and connected to the rest of the on-chain economy will be too great to not do it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KDZNRcDISyFhZC6C1Jc5l.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\nBlockchains enforce values such as equality of opportunity, truth, transparency, and autonomy. I think a society that runs on blockchains will be significantly more democratic. In my mind, the alternative is a world ran by a handful of Big Tech companies, that could be taken over by governments like China or the USA at any moment. This issue will become especially important as we move to augmented and virtual reality and technology becomes even more embedded into our lives.\n\nMany challenges remain before we can have our on-chain economy. We need to onboard billions of users, have simple methods for keeping your assets secure, reduce the possibility of human error (sending to wrong address), and we need to speed up the technology and lower transaction costs. Lastly, the biggest of challenge of all is regulation. I am convinced that a fully functional blockchain-based economy would benefit >99.99% of the world. However, the winners of the old system and people that misunderstand blockchains, will prefer having centralized systems win out. The regulatory battle is one that we must win to protect our freedom. If we do, I think almost every asset will go on-chain. This would give us more freedom and could unlock a new wave of human creativity.\n\nps. thanks to [@punk6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529) for many great insights.

{"id": "bhqkAIRUsz9TTj49Kv-HiUuUrGspCw5TVcqWD6tSxz4", "title": "跟着V神，初探SBTs", "body": "## SBT是什么\n\n是最早由V神在2022年1月提出的。全称为灵魂绑定代币Soul bound Token，是不可转让的非同质化代币（NFT），绑定在灵魂账户soul address中，可以简单理解为一种社会属性的凭证，代表个人用户独有的身份、声誉、资格等等。\n\nSoul bound灵魂绑定，最大特征就是不可转让性，最早是源自魔兽世界里。\n\n*一些有超能力的游戏物品都是灵魂绑定的，是不可以转移或售卖给别人的。所以玩家想获得这些超能力，不能通过购买，只能靠自己去杀死对应的怪物来获得他们的超能力）。可以这样理解，SBTs更多是非金融化的，不是用来交易的，是用来个人身份识别为主的。*\n\n## Soul bound的意义价值\n\n社会经济价值创造很大部分是基于人类关系网络和社会信用体系。而在当前的web3中，是缺乏社会身份这一元素的。所以，当前web3发展是存在局限性的。\n\nSoul bound技术，能给当前缺失“社会身份”的web3.0带来社会身份，可以创建web3.0的信用体系。有了web3社会身份，就会有使得更多政治、经济、文化上更多用例产生，建立新的多元化的生态系统，建立“去中心化社会（DeSoc）”。\n\n## Soul bound目前应用方向\n\n* **传统NFT领域**\n\n  现在很多NFT（游戏道具/艺术品），都具备一定特殊稀缺价值和社交属性，但由于其可交易性，这些NFT更多彰显的是财富资产（能支付得起某某）。 Soul bound可以让NFT去金融化，持有某NFT，可以代表更多个人的特质，体现持有人本身具备了怎样的亲身经历/技能，或者是说通过持有NFT而支持某某领域，比如慈善项目NFT等。\n\n  *已有的应用——POAP： the \"proof of attendance protocol\"，出席证明协议，代表了持有人参与了某事件/活动，或对此有过一定的贡献。*\n\n  *活动方/品牌方/项目方（Issuers），可以在POAP平台上创建自己的活动（需要经过平台方的中心化的审核）。用户（collectors），可以通过参与线上或线下如discord社区会议等各类活动后，领取POAP徽章。（从项目方那获取mint链接，或者去POAP官网，去查询是否有领取资格）*\n\n  *POAP mint发行，可以是线下机构，目前线上的项目方主要为元宇宙/游戏类项目为主，也有一定的Defi类项目。其中，比较有名的是元宇宙项目Decentraland（很多品牌方的POAP可以在里面认领）。关于交易方面，POAP本身妥协了，态度上是不鼓励徽章变成金融化的转让交易，徽章应作为承载和见证记录个体链上的美好生活的。但其底层技术上是支持可转让。目前，POAP 的二级市场是在Eporio（在XDAI也就是Gnosis链上的）。可以进行发送或者买卖交易。*\n\n  另一个与NFT结合的方式是，当前NFT作品来源及稀缺性，往往由NFT市场权威上架保证。但未来，如果越来越多艺术家们能打造自身身份的souls账户，那么集结越多souls凭证的NFT作品，更能和伪造品区分开来。\n* **在Souldrops & DAO领域**\n\n  传统的项目方发币空投，往往给到符合一定空投要求的一堆地址。用户获得空投后，很多就在二级市场套利变现。Souldrops可以改进当下的空投和DAO。最基础的作用就是，可以将SBTs来标识钱包，则可以区分机器人地址，降低女巫攻击，避免空投过于集中化或者囤积代币获取投票权。\n\n  进一步地，SBTs可以纳入空投的要求，得到更精准地用户识别，来筛选要空投激励的对象，找到更贴合项目发展目标或宗旨的用户，这样比一般常规的空投计划目的性更强。也可以让普通空投代币设计转化SBTs，发放后在一定时间内，不可转让性生效，也就意味着治理权是被锁定不可交易的，之后可以由不可转让变为最终可转让的代币。也可以相反，让前期可转让的普通代币，之后可以解锁成为SBTs。这样做的目的，都是鼓励长期持有参与社区自治，降低项目代币的投机性参与度。另外，SBTs间存在一定相关性，所以在DAO方面也可以尝试通过降低相关性高的SBTs的权重，以此来让少数派也有发言的权利，或者是给与由更多特殊SBTs的群体更多投票权。\n\n  总之，整体而言，无论是airdrop还是更广泛的DAO治理，soulbound都有很大的设计空间，来激励社区自治。\n\n  *相关的应用——Proof-of-Humanity Protocol人类证明：允许链上事务与人类证明绑定。可以在智能合约上建立人类档案，原始所有者可以上传视频，如果后面得到视频不一致，则抵押资产就会移除掉。通过提交个人认证视频，经过他人担保后成功注册，形成抗女巫攻击的人类名单。对DAO创新治理、个人声誉建立、抗女巫攻击的代币空投等都有好处。*\n* **在Defi Lending领域**\n\n  传统社会的无抵押借贷，是基于信用评级机制的，这个在当前web3.0是很难存在的。而借助soulbound，可以根据个人信誉发展信用抵押。\n\n  *相关的应用——CreDA Protocol：在传统defi的lending中引入了链上信用评级，将用户信用档案铸造成cNFT，从而使得借贷平台可根据cNFT等级，给予不同优惠利率或激励措施，提供个性化借贷服务。同时用户还可以基于信用评分加入信用网络，参与到信贷担保业务。CreDA 的信用评分是基于用户链上资产规模、参与Defi项目的链上行为活跃程度、参与Lending平台的贷款偿还记录等。*\n\n  ## Soul bound的社会恢复机制\n\n  关于souls钱包地址和其中的SBTs，如果丢失，目前提倡的技术方案是将通过社会恢复Social recovery甚至是community recovery来实现的。对于普通的Social recovery，找回成功与否，在于与监护人“guardians'' 的信任关系是否还健康持久。更佳的方式是，把souls的恢复从由简单的Social recovery变为SBT community recovery，也就由那些SBTs相关的souls 或者说是背后归属的community，让他们来参与恢复。让souls钱包找回是基于souls关系网络的。当前，绝大多数web3.0的钱包，是不适用的SBTs，因为对于要承载一个人的身份的钱包来说，一定是要可以实现身份恢复的，而非是一旦遗失私钥无法恢复。因此像Argent 和 Loopring 这样的非监护式社会恢复钱包，可以进行这块的探索。另外，正是因为这种社会网络下的恢复机制，也间接保证了souls的出售，因为出售的话，卖方是没办法保证他不会再去恢复的。\n\n  ## Soul bound的隐私设计\n\n  当前链上数据全部公开，但如果广泛运用后SBTs，多种SBTs映射成了一个个人像图谱，链上活动就会更加反映一个个具象的个体、有身份的人类活动，存在信息过度公开化。那么，对身份隐私性的保护也会更加重要。\n\n  目前相关隐私保护和数据授权的技术方案有以下几种：\n\n  1）SBTs存在于链下，但提交SBTs的哈希值给到链上。由持有人自行决定何时公开。（储存在链下，持有人自行寸尺，由索引、收件人地址、收件人secret所得到得哈希值。只有公开secret和给收件人他们的Merkle 分支，外界才能够看到持有哪些物品。）\n\n  2）运用零知识证明加密技术“zero knowledge proofs”。证明持有，但不透露过多信息比如个人身份。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dblXoG9tQSKcBWJpRKHFz.png?height=355&width=481)\n\n## Soulboud未来\n\n* 实践道阻且长，soulbound是DeSoc的起点而非终点，会把web3推向新型社会信用网络。而针对Soulbond的最主要的标志性特征-不可转让，过程中会有不同程度的“不可以转让交易”尝试或者是妥协实现。如当下有的将NFT和ENS绑定，则有的人会因为在意其ENS，而选择不转移NFT，从而一定程度实现了不可转让性。又如，前期可实现具有可撤销的功能，也就是可以通过一定身份认证进行撤销和重新发行，成为可撤销、可转让的代币。这样，间接降低SBTs被金融化出售的可能性。", "timestamp": 1658067395, "digest": "-UPqMBIVQDQ_LvK-Pd0-2COltEj0o4nwcvXszCt49EI", "contributor": "0x133C06D8CF2e9571F641e6c50BfEa9C9B944589c"}
{"id": "HK9uoBjpFTIGhW5ZxI8S1Jn1XmN7TZmhWPg6x5LF2VM", "title": "Sobriety Is My Superpower", "body": "The first time I drank alcohol I was 14 years old.\n\nIt was a foamy room temperature Bud Light from a beer ball.\n\nI had scored the winning goal for our varsity hockey team in the championship game of a New Year’s tournament. My parents let me (read as trusted me) go to a New Year’s Eve party with the upperclassmen on my team.\n\nIt was a sleepover.\n\nI was the only Freshman there.\n\nI slept in a bed with two Seniors. Females. One was a peer advisor.\n\nThe next morning we went to an iHop, drowned pancakes in syrup and used orange juice to take Tylenol. I learned what it meant to have a hangover. I also learned how to fix a mimosa. A teammate made them for us under the table with the 6oz bottles of cheap champagne he snuck in through the kangaroo pocket of his team issued sweatshirt.\n\nThe table toasted me, “*Happy New Year!*” I scored the winning goal, I was the only freshman at the party, I hooked-up with her.\n\nWith them.\n\nThis installed a series of narratives that would direct the next decade of my life.\n\nThat drinking alcohol, doing drugs, and partying was what popular, well-liked, and admired people do.\n\nThat drinking alcohol, doing drugs, and partying attracted women to me, or suppressed my insecurities enough that I could perform and attract women to me.\n\nThat drinking more alcohol, doing more drugs, and partying more than peers, would lead to wilder stories. At the time creating an identity synonymous with wild was my goal.\n\nAttention was the reward. Rejection the punishment.\n\nI feared rejection so much that I used alcohol to continue developing into the person that got attention, even if deep down it was out of alignment with who I was.\n\nToday, I’m embarrassed that this was aspirational to me. Not only did I subscribe to it, but I promoted it. This what was I sought, what I encouraged, and demanded of our others.\n\nIf you were friend enough to challenge me on this lifestyle, I eliminated you from my life. All I wanted was people to bring down with me. If I was going to self-sabotage and lie myself into a dependency, while advertise it as advantageous, I needed people to believe it true.\n\nSobriety has corrected all the above, and then some. It saved me.\n\nIt’s because of sobriety that I am thriving.\n\nSobriety is my superpower.\n\nThe immediate effects of sobriety came in the middle of the night.\n\nSleep is the foundation of Health. As Matthew Walker wrote in Why We Sleep, “*Sleep is more than a pillar of health; it is the foundation on which the other two health bastions sit.”*\n\nFor a decade, I had thought the cure to restlessness, bouts of insomnia, and red eye flights was a glass or two of of the good stuff. Sobriety corrected that.\n\nIt was Walker’s Why We Sleep that explained why:\n\n> *“The most misunderstood of all “sleep aids” is alcohol. Many individuals believe alcohol helps them to fall asleep more easily, or even offers sounder sleep throughout the night. Both are resolutely untrue. Alcohol does not induce natural sleep. Alcohol fragments sleep, littering the night with brief awakenings. Unfortunately, most of these nighttime awakenings go unnoticed by the sleeper and individuals therefore fail to link alcohol consumption the night before with feelings of next-day exhaustion caused by the undetected sleep disruption sandwiched in between. Alcohol will also often suppress REM sleep, especially during the first half or two-thirds of the night. People consuming even moderate amounts of alcohol in the afternoon and/or evening can inadvertently deprive themselves of dream sleep. Alcohol-infused sleep is therefore not continuous and, as a result, not restorative.”*\n\nWalker wraps with a bit of convincing advice, “*The annoying advice of abstinence is the best, and most honest, I can offer.”*\n\nAs wonderful as sleep is, alcohol would always keep me in bed for much longer than the recommend 7–9. Not only would I snooze alarms into the afternoon, but hangovers would pin me to couches for full days. The effects of alcohol were robbing my days, just as much as my nights. We already spend so much of our life sleeping, I’m no longer interested in wasting more moments horizontal reaching for hydration and headache relievers.\n\nThe next upgrade came with a floater of vanity.\n\nBeyond telling me to be confident, alcohol told me I was hungry.\n\nDrunk me liked to eat, everything. I once went to a dollar beer bar in Boston and ran up a $137 tab with only 12 beers. 6 plates of Nachos and 20 buffalo wings will do that.\n\nMy drinking weight was around 195 pounds, and riddled with injuries and joint pain. Today, 3 years into sobriety, I weigh 168 pounds and am in what I call life shape. I can answer any invite. Bike 100 miles for charity? Sure. Hike a mountain? Yes. Run a 5k tomorrow morning? Sign me up. Go camping? Fuck no, but that’s just because I don’t much like camping. Because of sobriety, I can treat life like an adventure.\n\nThen there is my skin. When you are hydrated, getting great sleep, and not putting damaging substances into your body, there’s a constant gloaming glow to your skin. I also get healthier doses of sun with natural outdoor movements.\n\nSobriety also allows me to avoid [the alarming effects alcohol has on my immune system](https://rickieticklez.medium.com/the-alarming-effects-alcohol-has-on-your-immune-system-615204bda634) and make better decisions that would have put my body as risk before. I’m less likely to drive a car drunk, get in a fight, or impulse jump off something dangerous.\n\nSobriety has done much more than apply new siding.\n\nI was in the lobby of the MIT library, rehearsing for an investor meeting. I was weak on the financials, getting there but stumbling.\n\n*“Why should I invest in you?”* We were still roll playing. “*Well,”* I started, *“I’m an Ivy League graduate with a double major in Economics and Political Science. I’m the former captain of the US National Team Under 18 Men’s Hockey team with 2 golds and 3 silvers. I’m a former professional athlete and member of the Italian Men’s National team. I was previously employee number #6 in a company that grew to 50+, I’m curious, I’m without distraction, and I’m sober.”*\n\n“Stop. Don’t say that. It opens a convo we don’t need to have and I don’t want to communicate instability,” my cofounder said.\n\nShe was wrong. Sobriety was exactly why they should invest, sobriety is my superpower.\n\nThe professional benefits of sobriety compound.\n\nThrough constant clarity, restful sleep, and intentional scheduling, I find myself not only with a time surplus, but more creativity, more energy, able to incubate ideas deeper, and that I’m more efficient when I work. What used to take days may now take a focused few hours. When your mind has no alterations, it’s constantly making progress. Every thought is working for me now, advancing me towards my goals.\n\nSobriety also launched my writing career. It gave me more time to engage in deeper research, to pursue curiosities, and has provided me perspective I lacked before.\n\nThe final frontier of sobriety is the mind.\n\nThere’s a difference between not drinking and sobriety. Simply not drinking is abstinence. Sobriety requires a daily commitment to doing “the work.” The work differs person to person. It has no required pace, but it does demand your attention. Progress has no speed, just a direction. My work has been through weekly therapy, meditation, active reading listening, and sometimes just sitting quietly in a room alone.\n\nI needed to not only unsew how I thought the world worked, but I needed to deeply heal my insecurities and understand why I used alcohol to quiet them in the previous chapter of my life.\n\nI needed to confront my ego, to understand it, and to find the courage to begin pursuing my true curiosities.\n\nI needed to find the language to introduce myself new self to old friends.\n\nI needed to learn to love myself.\n\nI needed to start healing.\n\nI also needed to learn compassion. For myself.\n\nKobe Campbell said, “*Healing is not becoming the best version of yourself, healing is letting the worst version of yourself be loved*.” Every day, I continue doing this work. That’s what sobriety is and why it’s my superpower.\n\nOver 3 years, I’ve learned how to speak about sobriety and retrace my steps in society.\n\nAt an outdoor bar, the bartender asked if I wanted a beer or well drink. I told him “No thanks, I have a drug and alcohol problem. I’ll just grab a water.”\n\nThis response startles most people. They laugh and the ice is broken across the group I’m with.\n\nBut still, the bartenders think I’m joking, so do strangers. That’s because I don’t look like what they’d been told alcoholics look like.\n\nUnfortunately, dramatized characters in film and television have allowed many to exclude themselves from questioning their relationship to alcohol, and a cultural glorification of alcohol consumption has only created more distance.\n\nMy job isn’t to inform you what counts as alcohol misuse, you can find those[ humbling definitions here](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/pdfs/excessive_alcohol_use.pdf) and[ here](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/alcohol-facts-and-statistics), but to at least highlight that alcoholism doesn’t exist. Alcohol use disorder does. And it’s quite common.\n\nChances are if you’ve ever drank alcohol before, you’ve misused it. My hands are empty, only you can hold a mirror to yourself, your behavior, and your patterns.\n\nWhat I do encourage those who ask is to remain curious and to challenge your beliefs. Maybe, like me, you’ll find that alcohol in fact is the single biggest parachute in your life and that sobriety could be your superpower too.\n\n\\-\n\n`Every year, I reflect on the previous 365 days of my sobriety with a Soberversary piece. Each Soberversary piece is published as a collectable NFT with a quantity of 26 to celebrate the age at which I chose sobriety.

are all Ryoshi。**\n\n**与此同时，Ryoshi更换了推特背景图：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wemYjUGHakbjxkv8J0sa2.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\n于是，有热衷于解密的推友发现了**乌鸦星座（Corvus)**。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bakenyamasan/status/1531171794199015424](https://twitter.com/bakenyamasan/status/1531171794199015424)\n\n当然，我们发现的不仅仅是一个疑似乌鸦星座的证据，还有：\n\n***最初的CAW反对者，SHIB社区最大的打脸者，在4月28日于马斯克推特下回复了乌鸦推文，以表忠心：***\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_/status/1519506586271502336](https://twitter.com/shibarium_/status/1519506586271502336)\n\n与此同时，在Ryoshi更换背景的同一天，这个逼把头像换成了满月：\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_](https://twitter.com/shibarium_)\n\n此时，我们注意到，今年的6月15日，是“超级月亮”，而7月15日，也就是池子解锁的日子，正是今年的年度最大满月。\n\n[https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E6%BB%A1%E6%9C%88/59919158](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E6%BB%A1%E6%9C%88/59919158)\n\n### 4.池子解锁-7月17日\n\n7月17日早上8点池子解锁。\n\n除此以外，项目方又给池子加了80wu的流动性。\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x87268eb2568fdc4be19396ce1c50a6712ca8cfb8abee880b8d3b767e07ca907d](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x87268eb2568fdc4be19396ce1c50a6712ca8cfb8abee880b8d3b767e07ca907d)\n\n部署地址再度给自己转账0.999eth，并**留言“zrUfKaKV”。**\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcae4b15350b3ccc2b37fec5caa718560241ec181bc49741d5d1199d1d32412d4](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcae4b15350b3ccc2b37fec5caa718560241ec181bc49741d5d1199d1d32412d4)\n\n### Part 3 ElonMusk&Vitalik&DogeFounder\n\n在SHIB暴涨的那一年，江湖上就有人疑似挖出了疑似的相关线索。\n\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593](https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593)\n\n**结论：**\n\n1\\.Ryoshi和Vitalik线下是朋友，Vitalik和Musk线下见过面；\n\n2\\.Ryoshi最后一篇文章里，本能地举例过，在一个南非最大港口Durbs卖鱼的例子，而Musk正出身于距离Durbs不远的南非比勒陀利亚；\n\n[https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter](https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter)\n\n**结论：**\n\n3\\.狗币founder与Musk的相爱相杀，疑似其在为马斯克写代码。\n\n### Part 4 神秘推特\n\n### A.MoonKnight\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dark_MoonKnight](https://twitter.com/Dark_MoonKnight)\n\n### B.MoonDame\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_](https://twitter.com/moondame_)\n\n在尽可能追踪和过滤掉关联信息的同时，我们得到了上方疑似项目方对外代表的两个账号。**江湖人称：神秘夫妇。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218](https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218)\n\n我们一下就想到了，Ryoshi在2021年5月29日的最后一篇文章里，他要做稳定币SHI，并在当时已经提出了设想，同时，我们本就也知道，Ryoshi可能不止一个人，而是两个以上在运作。\n\n从其神神叨叨的推文中，我们也得知，不止一个代币，还有：\n\n### (a).$O(Childhood End)|没有推特\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end)\n\n**以及**\n\n### (b).$QOM(Shib的L1）\n\n[https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1](https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1)\n\n当然这两个代币一直未得到社区的认可，直到，\n\nRyoshi的推特更换了月亮背景，Shibarium的推特更换了满月头像以及星星背景：\n\n我们发现，Shibarium的推特背景正是$O的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_](https://twitter.com/shibarium_)\n\nChildhood End意味着童年时代的结束，同时也是SHIB时代的结束。\n\n当然，我们发现的远不止这么多，**请参考Part 5第8条，马斯克推文莎士比亚戏剧The Tempest。**\n\n**除了神秘夫妻，7月以来我们又得到了一个CAW疑似对外的窗口：**\n\n### C.草间，疑似Shib目前的负责人。\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad)\n\n**7月13日**，明牌告诉你，**老娘是对外窗口：**\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547112545957322752](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547112545957322752)\n\n**在7月14日年度最大满月**，她发布如下推文：\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547500247093575680](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547500247093575680)\n\n除了不拉盘，其他的逼都让她装到位了。\n\n7月17日，头像和背景再度更换成乌鸦相关：\n\n![https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6N59vo1WfE9VJGxOj91Nl.png?height=570&width=737)\n\n### Part 5 马斯克推文\n\n1\\.在4月14日，caw被创建的当天，ElonMusk如下推文，与Logo三朵玫瑰相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473)\n\n2\\.马斯克喜欢特殊数字，与总量666...相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865](https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865)\n\n3\\.5月26日，老马发图，逆时针旋转能得到一个人物，原图和转图同时疑似能找到乌鸦：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366)\n\n4\\.5月28日，老马发图，解放Bird/推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823)\n\n5\\.5月28日，老马发图，图中疑似能找到乌鸦星座：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244)\n\n6\\.5月31日，老马发图，疑似将要推出去中心化推特，颠覆web2:\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921)\n\n7\\.6月4日，老马发图，箭头位置疑似能找到CAW的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712)\n\n8\\.6月6日，老马引用莎士比亚在The Tempest的内容；\n\n除了原戏能找到crow相关外，莎士比亚也曾被人评价为暴发户式的“乌鸦”；\n\n其次，Childhood END的链上总量数字**369369369373**在经过下方链接解码后，最后我们得到了风暴，即“The Tempest”。\n\n再次，\"O“可能不仅仅是Childhood End，也有乌鸦叫声的暗含。\n\n[https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text](https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text)\n\n：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241)\n\n9\\.7月17日，老马嘲讽老逼登：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346)\n\n文案可以看到句子的A，图片文字的Hunter，就差一个Dream，于是**热心的币友疑似发现相机的牌子叫做Dream。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T4-z5hhFqnoLBoIQMPtSR.png?height=1280&width=699)\n\n### Part 6 Twitter 前CEO：Jack\n\n**这是另外一条故事线了。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack](https://twitter.com/jack)\n\n在推特前CEO Jack的推特背景，你会看到纯黑的Background，更仔细一点，你就能发现，这个大哥，好像十分钟情于黑色，我们来看一组证明：\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/](https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/)\n\n是不是想到了乌鸦也是黑色，当你把推特的logo颜色更换成纯黑，我们能得到一个暗黑版的推特。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q69u4LI5cnmLR1Kn7EYVC.png?height=673&width=1144)\n\n2019年12月，Jack成立了一个由5个人组成的研发小组，基于区块链开发去中心化社交协议，而这个小组的名称叫Bluesky。\n\n**再仔细一点，Bluesky的头像里你会看到一只乌鸦。**\n\n巧了不是，还有更巧的，我们接着看。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bluesky](https://twitter.com/bluesky)\n\n那一年，Jack发布了一组关于去中心化社交平台的规划：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832)\n\n可以看到，Jack希望这个去中心化推特能有自己的一套标准，能有一个**民间领袖**引领社区（对照社区发现的白皮书）。在这背后，我们并不清楚Jack与Musk此前是否可能开始了接触，但是彼时的他们饱受推特当时的各种问题，至少在境遇上相似。\n\n换句话说，前文我们所谓意淫的马斯克的这套组合拳，是否还有一部分来自于推特前CEO的Jack。在2021年之前的某个时间节点，恰逢两人一拍即合，希望能够打造去中心化推特，解放言论。\n\n2020年，没有英雄，于是他们凭空捏造了一个英雄：Ryoshi，shib当时爆火的背后，可能从来不是被老马翻牌子那么简单。\n\n前文我们提到，Ryoshi可能等于Musk，但是从其谦卑的撰文风格来看，更符合Jack。\n\n同时，他也有在南非的经历。\n\n2019年开始，至今3年的时间即将推出产品，符合开发实际。\n\n而且，从目前的马斯克收购推特来看，营销炒作是实，收购是虚，拖沓战术，剧情的走向也像是在为顺势推出去中心化推特做铺垫，只为迎来某个时间节点。\n\n然后顺着BlueSky这条线索我们找到了其CEO推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea](https://twitter.com/arcalinea)\n\n我们往前翻看推特找到了如下：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017](https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017)\n\n说巧不巧，我们又在最近CAW社区提交的一份**github**中找到了如下：\n\n[https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames](https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames)\n\n**这个魔方图案有点眼熟。**\n\n于是，我们发现，**4月17号**这天，也就是 $CAW 被创建后部署池子的那一天：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594)\n\nJack说巧不巧的发布了一个月球表情，**对应Ryoshi的推特背景，Shibarium的头像，即一轮满月。**\n\n当然，还有：\n\n[https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418)\n\n狗币创始人给了上方回复，一切尽在不言中，而一切，你知我知。\n\n**有了上方的脆弱关联指向：**\n\n于是，我们回到6月11号，**Twitter及Square创始人Jack Dorsey**旗下TBD项目开发负责人**Mike Brock**在Consensus 2022大会上宣布将**建立一个名为“Web 5”的去中心化网络平台。**\n据Mike Brock透露，Web5将为应用程序带来去中心化身份（DID）和数据存储服务，让开发人员专注于创造优质的用户体验，同时将数据和身份的所有权归还给个人。**Web 5的货币层将建立在比特币的基础上，目前仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。**\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/)\n\n还记得在链上数据那一章节，caw的部署地址曾经给自己转账留言，表示**后续会迁移流动性吗**？那时候我们对流动性的迁移一头雾水，现在来看。更像是再为迁移至比特币做冷启动准备。又或者真的是QOM的L1，鬼知道呢？\n\n### Part 7 Mcafee\n\n没错，就是大家最喜欢的新机到家，第一时间先卸载的破安全软件。这家公司的官方TG，在停运的一年后，也就是今年6月前后，再度开始活跃。这都不是重点，主要是内容全是乌鸦以及近乎明牌。\n\n这家公司就一副老子知道秘密，但是一个屁也不会放的态度：\n\n[https://t.me/McafeeAfterlife/925](https://t.me/McafeeAfterlife/925)\n\n关注我，一个贪财好色又想装逼的作者：\n\n[https://twitter.com/yaje_nav](https://twitter.com/yaje_nav)\n\n",

{"id": "pk_VtBhCU0Qzv2wgZ3uADtOu_5iBs3haPmO5xcGFewI", "title": "Why NFTs may be a bigger deal than you think", "body": "Obviously the JPEG collectors utter that NFTs are the future of everything. The first time I heard the claim that every business will implement NFTs it sounded oddly familiar to BTC maximalist narratives. Here is a new technology that is magically going to solve all our problems and transform society.\n\n**But I’ve converted. NFTs are actually the future. Let me explain.**\n\nBlockchains are a phenomenal invention. Bitcoin solved the problem of how to get complete strangers to agree on something as valuable as money. An underrated consequence of Bitcoin’s success is popularizing the concept of digital scarcity.\n\nEthereum extended the capabilities of the blockchain. Now the entire economy can be represented on-chain. Indeed, we are seeing marketplaces, loans, stocks and options all being put on-chain. Our newfound capabilities to represent these financial instruments on-chain led to a DeFi wave that minted many nouveaux riches.\n\nBut that is simply what they are, financial instruments. They are not the things everyday people use in their daily life. If we are to represent the entire economy on-chain we need an additional piece of infrastructure: NFTs.\n\nNFTs can represent anything scarce. Almost the entire world is non-fungible, only financial instruments are not. To have on-chain representations of our possessions like cars, watches, houses and intangibles such as music and in-game items, we need NFTs. Tokens that represent something unique.\n\nNFTs are also bringing communities together that align around a goal, such as [buying a golf course,](https://linksdao.io/) [a vacation manor](https://manordao.com/), or [adopting a football team](https://wagmiunited.com/). People are using NFTs as their (online) identity. And each NFT collection such as CryptoPunks and Bored Apes has different cultures associated with it. If you don’t realize how big of a deal this is check out the following tweets by @punk6529:\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1424127519658229760](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1424127519658229760)\n\nCulture is our most valuable asset. NFTs are eating culture. They are a way to own it, and to represent it financially. The market size of intangibles is in the trillions.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1430281972920770560](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1430281972920770560)\n\nNFTs could therefore represent something bigger than the fungible tokens we have seen dominate the crypto space so far. It is already the most promising avenue for mainstream crypto adoption. punk6529 calls NFTs crypto’s consumer moment: people stopped talking about the technology and instead started talking about which ape or bird they have.\n\n[https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1488423680543801344?s=20&t=59nXwndyDt7BLxOyG15JVA](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1488423680543801344?s=20&t=59nXwndyDt7BLxOyG15JVA)\n\nSo, NFTs could be a big deal. That is, IF we are going to tokenize intangibles and put our possessions on-chain. In the next post we will dig exactly into that question: Is everything going on-chain?\n\n\\- Wesley", "timestamp": 1658067147, "digest": "7J9xhwiAzLdrpF5PpVa6rraF91WlXlwGQdv-HS_n-A0", "contributor": "0x5B3DaFc35dcf434153B5DF2be2C493Df4403AA75"}

"以下全文，均已打码非相关人员，未打码均属事件相关方或明文参与该事件者，或已征得当事人同意。\n\n直接进正题，结论基于事实，整理以下事件故事线。\n\n【一】事件故事线：\n①23.12分，我花了24只苍蝇帮群友测试概率，得出结论，劝群友莫要赌狗，直接稳定合成还可以省gas(ps,苍蝇合同是确实有点拉了，不仅合成概率低，而且特定的id合成会必然导致交易失败）\n\n![亏钱帮群友试概率，黑鬼就是我，哈哈](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1T-Nw37ii6yt2UJrU90IZ.jpg?height=2018&width=932)\n\n②23.32分 某科学家提出收费3u弄苍蝇一代百分之百合成二代的要约邀请\n\n![乙方提出3u手续费帮100%合成二代苍蝇的要约邀请](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jMCZi9RTDdyha1SaY19Ei.jpg?height=1571&width=726)\n\n③24.01分向某科学家指定账号转入8个一代苍蝇，\n交易哈希0x32897b7d3b16a3e244c9c7a78a27b9011e7de390b3c871b748193fb4c955fa58\n（第一笔交易）\n花费0.0067gasfee\n\n至此，第一笔要约已经成立，双方约定以每笔3u手续费，甲方（NNNNFTSmith）向乙方（wuyige520521）转8个一代小苍蝇，乙方将发回8个二代小苍蝇。\\*\\*【第一笔交易约定内容敲定】\n\n④\\*\\*2点左右询问乙方（wuyige520521）可否为其他群友操作，乙方同意，并表示价钱要增加到合三只苍蝇只给两只二代，**其中一只便是酬劳**。同时明确三点为官方合成截止时间DDL。（这次无可厚非，谈好条件前加价合理）\n\n⑤2.40分（距离苍蝇官方twi截止时间还有20分钟），群友坤坤（也是热心帮其他群友谈了很多白名单的好哥哥，这也是为什么我后来大半夜贴钱也要帮坤坤要回他的苍蝇的原因）在于乙方确认截止时间（3点前截止）确认价格（发6个初代，发回4个二代）的情况下，向乙方转6个初代苍蝇\n交易哈希0x85d571494c475af8533bcf0fd9722d4253abc9430a810e524425e72ebb6dc53e\n(第二笔交易，花费gasfee0.015)\n\n![乙方与群友坤坤第二笔要约细则敲定](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f1zYAeZQU2ZYRPeN0Bbdc.jpg?height=1568&width=724)\n\n至此，第二笔要约已经成立，双方约定以甲方（坤坤）向乙方（wuyige520521）转6个一代小苍蝇，乙方将发回4个二代小苍蝇。【第二笔交易约定内容敲定】\n\n（注意这里乙方的利润是每合成两只只收一只一代苍蝇（抽成33%），甲方无需提供额外gas费用）\n\n⑥2.44分，在群友坤坤向乙方（wuyige520521）转账6个一代苍蝇的四分钟后之后，乙方（wuyige520521）突然表示其合约没有写转出方式（合约不开源，暂无从考究，从无罪者论出发，暂且视为true，但这无论如何，都不该是群友坤坤的责任），这时群友也有点慌，毕竟东西都转到乙方（wuyige520521）的账户了，试问你作为当事人甲方，没有任何筹码，只能任由乙方摆布，有顾虑也非常合理。\n\n![乙方（wuyige520521）在收到14只小苍蝇之后才表示合约没有转出功能，锁死14只nft](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oDwKcWM9klkwvYCj_MtTn.png?height=793&width=441)\n\n⑦2.56分苍蝇官方发布公告，burn时间延续12个小时，其他群友也提醒\n乙方（wuyige520521）乙方也表示“那就好，那我慢慢合”表明其明确知悉还有十二个小时时间去合成，并且没有任何人”要求“催促他去完成，并再次强调“合约只进不出”的事情。\n\n⑧3.05分，乙方（wuyige520521）第一次加微信私聊群友坤坤，要求再向其发送2只苍蝇，且最终只返回2只（如此一来群友坤坤的成本就要**10只初代换4只2代了**）。\n\n群友坤坤马上发来语音质问我，理清缘由后我跟乙方（wuyige520521）协商，出发点是让群友坤坤拿到第二笔要约约定的4个二代苍蝇。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jQI1pnsTQD1dhBYzjedfL.jpg?height=2436&width=1125)\n\n![谈好的条件出尔反尔，号称合约无法取出，却让群友自己调用【合约至今未开源】](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JmiceF4cIDlxr2Cp5gQEX.jpg?height=2436&width=1125)\n\n⑨我与乙方（wuyige520521）初步协商结果是，我个人再补贴他3个v1的小苍蝇，但是坤坤的四个还是按第二个要约的约定，给他4个二代。\n\n（即为我的8只返回5只，kunkun的6只返回4只，共有5只作为他的劳动报酬）\n乙方（wuyige520521）表示“行啊

Twi：@talking_grass】就是一个几度出尔发尔，无视无故契约精神，的蝇营狗苟之辈。\n\n【三】事后汇总及”人生百态“\n熊市闲来无事，有瓜吃，我也喜欢，没想到这次吃瓜吃到自己身上，我是万万没想到的，\n但是我们也要反问自己：\n\\*\\*试问web2到web3连最简单的契约精神也丢了吗？Web2到web3连最简单的尊重事实也丢了吗，在web2遇到的背信弃义之举，到了web3就变成了“理所当然”了吗？\n我相信我们来web3是为了一个创造一个不亚于web2的新世界，而不是取其糟粕，取其精华的web3。\n**人间百态：**\n\\*\\*某0X大社区kol既不经调查便“支持维权”，\n殊不知该kol是没了创立自己社区之初勠力为群友，不问回报，但求事实的初衷，还是没有社区建立过程中遇到宵小之辈的困扰，竟毫不调查，为人迷惑，罔顾事实。\n如果还有一点同行之间，同好之间的惺惺相惜，莫要忘记也支持下小社区的“维权”\n\n某蓝筹群群友(@Leon_dcc)群里阴阳功力溃败于我，又喜落井下石，我只能说：\n“老子买了xxx亏了钱，我还不能说句话，而且我说的说的100句话里面有99句都说的是“亏都亏了，xxx的图确实好看,项目方确实在做事，坚持一下”之类的，盯着老子那一句“干事的不如不干事的，哈哈”。\n原由是其他群友在说另外一个蓝筹Mxxx创始人跑路反而起飞，xxxx项目方一直做事反而一直跌。【不引战不带节奏，可能有消极影响的全打码，偏积极影响的半打码】\n\n【最终】\n\n本不想浪费时间在这个背弃信义的科学家身上的，因为熊市大家本该共度时艰，不应该内耗如此。\n但无奈被反咬一口，并且此人无限骚扰我们群友与管理（下附图），我只能用自己拙劣的文笔，博君一笑，也愿web3多一些信任，少一些尔虞我诈。\n在此和某蓝筹Mxxxxx以及因为我俩私事的受到影响的朋友说声抱歉，本来就是几个人之间的私事，只有宵小之辈，只顾一己私利，才恶意挑起群体矛盾（也就是所谓的带节奏）\n【乙方某些”合作“社区和某些队友，你们的社区，个人ID已经在截图和记录中被乙方屡次“不打码”，孰高孰低，显而易见，望自重】\n\n![乙方不仅将个人矛盾上升到各大社区矛盾，还无下限私聊骚扰我方群友](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sehhQi4YHSO4God2glrkC.png?height=469&width=746)\n\n我们玩NFT都是因为兴趣爱好，都是一群人一起玩喜好的东西，做喜爱的事情，从昨晚事情发酵至今，我们没有一个人去骚扰任何人，没有一个人去用这件事挟持任何一个项目和社区，没有去激发任何群体的对立。

{"id": "6uhbLbv7OwU7pFwWGs1ATER7eQKpE4qLzFZgX0jXcgo", "title": "一文了解艺术品NFT", "body": "持续近一年的JPEG summer落下帷幕，自去年6月以来，NFT市场的交易额首次低于10亿美元，许多受欢迎的系列价格都有一定幅度的下跌，市场正在经历考验。\n\n去年4月开始，NFT场景开始爆发，大量艺术家及个人创作者加入NFT创作，NFT生态逐渐繁荣。但另一方面，随着BAYC模式的成功，PFP NFT开始成为 NFT 社区和整个市场的代表，经过一年的酝酿PFP的同质化问题暴露了出来，NFT场景扩张陷入阻滞。与此同时，艺术品NFT仍未大范围进入普通加密藏家投资组合，艺术品NFT相较于PFP NFT及现代艺术品收藏市场均处于早期。\n\n在此份报告中，将对NFT艺术收藏品进行梳理，其中包括NFT市场概况、2021年以来的NFT重要事件、艺术NFT发展现状、未来发展方向等。列举数十个艺术NFT项目，以展现这一赛道的基本情况。\n\n## 一、NFT市场\n\n### 1.市场市场\n\n根据DappRadar报告，2021年NFT 的总净销售额接近250亿美元，整体市场与2020年相比增长了 26,000% 以上。\n\n![2021 NFT sales](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3hZhs3cyA7gv1140SxXtq.png?height=764&width=1370)\n\n2020 年传统艺术品和古董的销售额达到 500 亿美元，NFT市值正在飞速接近人们买卖实体艺术品的传统艺术市场。而佳士得和苏富比等拥有数百年历史的传统艺术品拍卖行，已经加入NFT热潮售出价值数百万美元的 NFT。\n\nNFT 市场的广泛繁荣为个人卖家带来了数百万美元的利润。NonFungible.com表示，NFT 交易员通过买卖 NFT 赚取了超过 54 亿美元的总利润。在去年参与购买 NFT 的大约 200 万个活跃钱包中，其中 473 个产生了至少 100 万美元的利润。\n\n进入 2022 年，NFT 市场保持强劲。2022年至今（7月17日）NFT市场交易额727万ETH，198万个钱包交易NFT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hjbCAdBnc2a7v3RnRs96r.png?height=816&width=2154)\n\n### 2.赛场\n\n大多数 NFT 和项目目前属于 以下6 个类别，其中大部分属于收藏品和实用程序：艺术、收藏品、赌博、元宇宙、实用程序、所有权证明。\n\n**艺术：**现实生活中的艺术家（包括数字原生艺术家和传统艺术家）的实际艺术作品\n\n**收藏品：**主要指PFP项目，这些项目具有不同程度的稀有性。\n\n**游戏：**游戏中这些可以是在单独使用的 NFT，或者 NFT 可能是游戏本身的基础。\n\n**Metaverse：**类似于游戏，尽管这些与不一定应用游戏机制的数字世界有关。\n\n**实用程序：**任何提供当前或未来实际功能的 NFT，例如服务、会员资格或对内容的访问都属于Utility类别。\n\n**所有权证明：**这仍然是一个相对较新的类别，但我们已经看到汽车制造商和时装公司在有限系列中将这些作为所有权证明引入。\n\n一个项目可能同时归属于多个类别，被分类为什么项目取决于它们在路线图中的哪个阶段。\n\n### 3. 各场市场交易额\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dbt0D4hQCCcWN73xyg6wE.png?height=940&width=1334)\n\n根据已统计的176亿美元NFT销售额比例，各赛道交易额及占比如下：\n\n**收藏品：**84.7亿美元，占48.1%\n\n**游戏：**51.8亿美元，占29.4%\n\n**艺术：**28亿美元，占15.9%\n\n**实用程序：**5.3亿美元，占3%\n\n**元宇宙：**5.13亿美元，占2.9%\n\n收藏品和游戏是导致去年 NFT 交易激增的两个类别。仅收藏品就产生了超过 84 亿美元的销售额。收藏品和游戏两个类别发行模式趋于成熟，新的突破口将集中在其他类别，如艺术、实用程序、元宇宙。\n\n# 二、NFT大事件\n\n### 1.Crypto Punnks：NFT OG\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VVAQq8Vsi86nMRCHtJYy9.png?height=1016&width=1398)\n\nCryptoPunks由 Matt Hall 和 John Watkinson 于 2017 年创建，主形象是像素朋克，被认为是首批创建并免费提供的 NFT 系列。CryptoPunks的价值在 2021年1 月份开始飙升，有些甚至达到了 100 万美元。\n\n很快，有些punks的价格超过 1100 万美元，几乎不再有人能买得起CrypyoPunks。作为以太坊有史以来第一批NFT之一，它以20.2亿美元的总市值位列NFT项目排行榜第一，累计持有者3543人，迄今项目最高价值作品是于2021年10月29日交易的CryptoPunks#9998，售价达到5.3亿美元。NFT的序幕正式拉开。\n\n### 2.Beeple：著名拍卖行首次提供NFT\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QmRhxVrfFKwQo6gWhc1xH.png?height=946&width=1570)\n\nBeeple从2007年5月1日开始，每天创作一幅数字作品，不间断地持续13年半将它们集合为“Everydays: The first 5000 days”。当Beeple在佳士得以 6900 万美元的价格售出“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”时，一切都变了,天价使他成为世界上第三贵的在世艺术家。\n\n虽然 NFT 的价格足以令人留下深刻的印象，但这是著名拍卖行首次提供 NFT，仅此一项就为新兴的 NFT 市场带来了有力的支持，在当时看来，它随时可能仅仅成为一个小众的互联网热点。但这次拍卖有效地进入了大众视野，表明 NFT 不仅仅是昙花一现。\n\n佳士得艺术专家诺亚戴维斯说：”我们正处在一个可能会发生巨大转变的时刻，吸引年轻收藏家的东西完全变了，人口转变和代际转变成了我们最注意的事“。\n\n这次竞拍总计有33位竞标，其中有91%从未参与该平台的竞标，这些竞标者超过半数（58%）的竞标者为千禧世代（1981年-1996年），他们增长于信息科技爆发的年代，还有33%为出生于1965年至1980年，而“婴儿潮世代”（出生于1946—1964年）的竞标者为 3%，数量是Z世代（出生于1995-2009年）竞标者的一半。很显然NFT成为了打开千禧一代和Z世代年轻收藏家收藏之门的钥匙。\n\n### 3.Bored Ape Yacht Club：JPEG summer和PFP崛起\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A8Cr83EU1gOQo2wGwQHuc.png?height=892&width=880)\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club(以下简写“BAYC”)是一个 NFT 头像项目，主形象是一个无聊的猿猴，搭配各种表情和配饰。从 NFT 头像起步，它建立了活跃的社区文化，形成了品牌效应，收购了老牌 NFT 项目 Cryptopunks 和 Meebits，成为 NFT 头像类项目的龙头\\*\\*。\\*\\*随后，建立 ApeCoin DAO，发行代币 APE，将打造元宇宙空间，建设 NFT 头像、区块链游戏等生态发展空间。BAYC 横跨至元宇宙赛道，寻求新的发展空间。\n\n随着“BAYC”的成功，一些类似的项目开始涌现，因为它们通常强调可用作社交媒体头像，这些项目被称为profile-pic NFT (PFP NFT)。PFP NFT 在夏季开始主导市场，交易的热度让收藏家将这个夏季称为 JPEG 夏季。\n\nPFP NFT成为NFT 社区和整个市场的代表，这引起了外部评论家的愤怒，他们认为PFP对市场的主导地位证明了 NFT 缺乏艺术价值。\n\n## 4.MFers：CC0的去中心化品牌建设实验\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7reex470uzmUbv-ZoLobi.png?height=946&width=1476)\n\n出于对Yuga Labs等头部项目版权限制的不满，CC0 NFT（Creative Commons 0 NFT）应运而生，Mfers、Cryptoadz、Blitmap和Nouns等NFT项目为持有者提供了更大的自由：可以不购买NFT、可以随意改造图片、可以使用logo和品牌、可以随意做任何你想做的事。\n\nMFers的成功是相当独特的，因为它没有Utility，也没有路线图。Sartoshi表示“我所设想的 MFers 世界将集中体现‘我们都是 MFers’这个简单的想法。没有国王、统治者或明确的路线图——MFers 可以用这些 MFers 构建他们能想到的任何东西。”\n\n在今年6月9日创始人Sartoshi宣布离开MFers的社区，自此MFers走上了完全的去中心化品牌建设之路，没有任何人拥有版权，每个人都拥有版权，在人们对MFers的创作过程中每一个MFers持有人都将因为品牌价值的提升而从中获益。这种众筹的品牌建设模式会走向何方？相信时间会给出完美的答案。\n\n## 5.Fidenza：Artblocks与NFT的艺术用途\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-0JhpSlKPcYt06OasG1JM.png?height=1086&width=906)\n\n生成艺术家Tyler Hobbs的NFT项目“Fidenza”于6月在NFT平台Art Blocks上线。“Fidenza”由Hobbs设计的算法随机生成，并包含丰富多彩的曲线和方块，发行后大获成功，其中Fidenza #313 以 1,000 ETH（购买时为 330 万美元）易手，爆火后为Artblocks平台每天带来数百万美元的交易量。\n\n尽管加密艺术和数字艺术有着悠久的历史，但 ArtBlocks 是第一个将艺术NFT成功推向主流NFT得到成功的，它获得了其他加密艺术家的支持。\n\n## 6.Pak's Merge : 概念与商业的碰撞\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QstTh7ilS82yoOXBz0vUs.png?height=1164&width=2532)\n\n数字艺术家 Pak 的作品在过去一年中一直畅销，去年12 月初，他的作品 “Merge”将他的市场推向了新的高度。在 12月2日至4日期间，他在Nifty Gateway 上以 9180 万美元的总价售出了 250,000 个“mass units”。\n\n让这次拍卖令人印象深刻的不是它所要求的价格，而是他使用区块链技术创造了一个巨大的概念艺术作品。在售出这些units后，Nifty Gateway将它们铸造为 NFT，合并每个买家的units。例如，购买 100 个批量单位的买家与购买 10,000 个的买家拥有不同的 NFT。而且每次购买Merge NFT 时，它都会与现有的Merge合并，减少NFT数量\\*。\\*\n\nNifty Gateway宣传Pak是最昂贵的在世艺术家，甚至超过Jeff Koons。\n\n## 7.NFT.NYC：步入IRL\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G2hwAEuXO5AcGaG9M9kMB.png?height=1134&width=1752)\n\nNFT.NYC是由Jodee Rich和Cameron Bale早在2018年创立，今年已经进入了第四个年头，他们想将NFT创作者和收藏者聚集在一起，今年涵盖了超过16个领域，包括艺术、摄影、音乐和电影等。本次NFT NYC有超过15,000名与会者注册了会议，而去年这个数字只有5,000左右。\n\nNFT 社区的成员从世界各地飞来，在纽约市与 IRL 会面。NFT 社区庞大而充满活力一直被认为完全是线上的。但NFT.NYC让更多的人看到了NFT的的线下财力，无数的场地被出租给独家和豪华的派对，收藏家、爱好者和更多人一起陶醉于这场NFT盛会。\n\n从CryptoPunks到“Everydays”，NFT正式进入艺术投资市场占有一席之地；从BAYC到MFers到NFT.NYC，归属于holders的商业版权放开，品牌打造方式逐步丰富，NFT影响力从线上转向线下；Artblocks促进生成艺术的繁荣，PAK将概念艺术推向大众视野，Jeff Koons宣布正在筹备自己的NFT，越来越多的艺术家开始进行加密结合的艺术创作。\n\n# 二、艺术NFT发展现状\n\n## 1.艺术NFT项目\n\n艺术品NFT主要分为以下几类，同一个项目可能同时归属于多个类别，这取决于它们在路线图中的哪个阶段。\n\n* **静态艺术**\n\n静态艺术通常是专门从事平面创作的图形艺术家的选择，也是传统艺术家的首选，他们将自己的实体作品制作副本并符号化。在这里，我们介绍上面提到过的主流拍卖行的NFT拍卖里程碑艺术家——Beeple。\n\n**Beeple**\n\n代表作品：\n\n“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”，在佳士得以 6900 万美元的价格售出。\n\n在“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”中，Beeple将反复出现的主题和配色方案拼接成一个整体。反复出现的主题包括社会对技术的痴迷和恐惧；对财富的渴望和怨恨；以及美国的政治动荡。\n\n* **GIFs/视频**\n\n除静态NFT外，你还可以经常看到一些GIF和视频NFT作品。GIF和视频可以结合动画和声音，借此艺术家可以创造出融合视觉和听觉体验的沉浸式作品，更深刻的打造作品中的场景。\n\n**XCOPY**\n\nXCOPY 来自伦敦，是一位“长期主义数字艺术家和加密爱好者”，加密艺术界的原生黑帮。作为SuperRare上的原创艺术家，他在Nifty Gateway上大获成功，XCOPY 是 NFT 艺术社区的领导者。\n\nXCOPY 通常专注于类似风格的单版、1/1 作品，其中一些作品的标题评论NFT文化和时事评论——例如Right Click 和 Save As Guy和All-Time High in the City。随着NFT市场的增长，这些作品和其他作品的价值越来越高。\n\n今年3月，XCOPY的Max Pain NFT的公开版本在10分钟内以价值2300 万美元售出，而这两天Grifters by XCOPY的地板价从10ETH小小的涨到了20ETH，众巨鲸集体晒单，黑帮仍在席卷整个NFT社区。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0MAqERAqkwQ5c3Si9eR4.png?height=810&width=1448)\n\n**Mad Dog Jones**\n\nMad Dog Jones将音乐和艺术结合在一起，创造了符合动态、适应性和超现实概念的艺术作品。他的艺术作品是赛博朋克式的城市建筑或街道场景。他已售出1567件NFT艺术品，平均每件9063.52美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9x3g8i3EeMQWprMLWX5gX.png?height=1282&width=1280)\n\n代表作品：\n\n“REPLICATOR”，以 410 万美元的价格售出。REPLICATOR NFT 项目每 28 天产生新的艺术品。第一代 NFT 产生了六个新的 NFT，六个中的每个产生五个，就像复印机一样，这样的生成会一直持续到第七代，买家最终可以拥有180到220个独特的NFT，每个都可以再次出售产生价值。\n\n“Crash + burn”，以390万美元的价格售出。\n\n* **摄影**\n\n我们经常可以看到网络上的优秀摄影作品，当我们想收藏数字摄影作品时，我们能想到的往往是保存下来或者购买摄影作品集。\n\nNFT的出现让摄影作品可以被直接收藏，上传同时即可为作品进行确权，也可以便于藏家收藏。\n\n**Cath Simard**\n\n代表作品：\n\n“FreeHawaii”， 以100ETH被知名的NFT收藏家Gmoney收藏。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tbqiI_DRvmljscaXmCHKG.png?height=1348&width=1082)\n\n2017年Cath Simard拍摄了一张夏威夷孤独道路的照片。她在Instagram账户上发布后，照片很快被转载盗用但却未被标明原作者，而Simard在多次起诉侵权者后仍无法得到任何金钱赔偿。最终她决定在SuperRare上将这张照片作为NFT来铸造，并在购买后向公众公布照片的使用权。FreeHawaii照片现在是最著名的NFT摄影作品之一。\n\n* **生成艺术**\n\n**Autoglyphs by Larva Labs**\n\nLarva Labs2019年创作的Autoglyphs，加密社区中的许多人认为这是第一个链上生成艺术收藏品。上周价格回弹至300ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dEugdYpvY70m7bmUtr-Pj.png?height=1070&width=1096)\n\n**Artblocks策展系列**\n\n由 Art Blocks 策展委员会批准的收藏。它们最能代表平台的官方愿景，按季度发布。Fidenza、Ringers是让人印象深刻的系列。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lOgLDsm4wSYFpYyLXHgqm.png?height=1090&width=906)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BolRLEgX-mIAhP5BFVKNA.png?height=898&width=894)\n\n* **艺术收藏品**\n\n**Hashmasks**\n\nHashmasks是一个由全球70多位艺术家共同创作的合作性艺术项目，于2021年1月启动，共有16384个独特的Hashmasks。这是 NFT 历史上第一次允许每个收藏品由买家命名的数字艺术收藏品，藏家可以使用空投的NCT代币为收藏品命名，每个收藏品的价值由艺术品的创作者及其消费者共同决定。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UOa2aYVglk4Ia1inEnJFn.png?height=1254&width=894)\n\n总量：16,384\n\n地板价：0.388ETH\n\n持有人数：5.2k\n\n网站：<https://www.thehashmasks.com/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/hashmasks>\n\n**Murakami.Flowers**\n\n艺术家村上隆的代表作品——花卉，以点状艺术的形式表现出来，让人想起 1970 年代创作的日本电视游戏。该作品正在以数字108为关键词进行开发；108个背景和花色组合构成一个字段，有108个字段。每个字段有 108 个花卉图像，总共有 11,664 个花卉图像。数字 108 指的是 bonnō 或世俗的诱惑。将发行游戏、策划线下艺术展、尝试在数字世界中重现日本神山富士山脚下樱花盛开的Metaverse\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FIQpFyk1PBY1hZQb8L8hb.png?height=906&width=896)\n\n总量：9.5k\n\n地板价：2.95ETH\n\n持有人数：5.6k\n\n网站：<https://murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/murakami-flowers-2022-official>\n\n**\"MOAR\" by Joan Cornella**\n\n\"MOAR\"是虚拟世界中的一座不同寻常的豪宅，其中有5,555 个生物的灵魂，这些“和平共处”的人类、机器人甚至僵尸都是独一无二的，由西班牙艺术家 Joan Cornellà 手绘而成。发行后将为藏家空投各种实物周边、豪宅房间，策划”MOAR”展览。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qpdlsWYy-6m1zpyYxV7Ld.png?height=900&width=900)\n\n总量：5.6k\n\n地板价：0.945ETH\n\n持有人数：2.9k\n\n网站：<https://joancornella.fwenclub.com/>\n\nOpensea:<https://opensea.io/collection/official-moar-by-joan-cornella>\n\n**Munko by David Choe**\n\nDavid Choe是位韩裔美籍画家。擅长画人物画，壁画，涂鸦，和连环小说画。David Choe被大众熟知是由于其神奇的天降横财经历，他在Facebook创业阶段为他们进行总部大楼涂鸦，从6万美元和Facebook股票这两种作画酬劳方式中选择了后者。据纽约时报估计，他手头的股票值2亿美元，成为了Facebook十大亿万富翁中最具传奇色彩的一位。\n\nMunko想给大家带来简单地自由地创造和连接的快乐，纯粹的激情、创造和好奇心的vibe是Munko 的特点。藏家可以通过回答一些问题来提交自己的每个人的信息，生成与自己相关的独特Munko。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4yuMEmvrVTd5oKsEPm8Ma.png?height=1170&width=1056)\n\n总量：5.2k\n\n地板价：0.2ETH\n\n持有人数：2.2k\n\n网站：<https://munko.io/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/munko-by-david-choe>\n\n## 2.艺术家社区\n\n### JPG社区\n\n* 介绍：\n\n  jpg.space立志成为加密世界的 Tumblr。用户可以导入和显示 OpenSea上可用的任何 NFT，以策划自己的画廊。他们希望人们从精心策划的画廊中找到价值，NFT已经成为财富聚集的游戏，如果你没有钱你很难在社区中定位自己，他们希望人们可以在NFT世界中发现更多的价值。\n\n  JPG社区是由收藏家、策展人、创作者构成的策展社区，允许每个人创建 NFT 展览。通过信誉系统衡量每个人对策展网络的贡献，发展具有内部声誉系统的去中心化社区。\n* 团队：\n\n  jpg.space由 Fernandez 和联合创始人 Trent Elmore 和 Sam Spike 于 去年7 月推出，在今年1月的种子轮融资中获得 380 万美元。\n* 网站：\n\n  <https://jpg.space/>\n\n### GODA\n\n* 介绍：\n\n  GODA是艺术家与藏家社区，以GODA PASS作为准入门槛。GODA与传统艺术家在数字艺术空间中密切合作，帮助他们在社交媒体传达自己的创作语言。确保合作艺术家无缝、有影响力的投放，尊重他们的艺术价值。对收藏家提供市场上最好的收藏品。\n\n  GODA 团队策划了一个收藏品系列，其中包括来自传统艺术界的知名人物以及GODA的合作艺术家。\n* 团队：\n\n  GODA团队由消费者、艺术、音乐、NFT 和时尚领域知名人士领导。包括：Nina Chanel Abney、Shaun Neff、Pharrell Williams、KAWS等。\n* 网站：\n\n  <https://thegoda.io/>\n\n## 3.艺术NFT市场\n\n**SuperRare**\n\nSuperRare帮助艺术收藏降低门槛，建立一个值得信赖的社区，让艺术家可以直接接触买家。长期以来艺术收藏市场一直是不透明且排他性的市场，大多数人无法进入。SuperRare让数字艺术首次能以大规模公开的方式在线发售。拍卖的每一件作品都经过身份验证，并被标记为任何人都可以拥有和交易的加密收藏数字物品。所有交易均使用以太坊网络上的原生加密货币以太币进行。\n\n近期，SuperRare在纽约 SoHo 区的 417 West Broadway 开设快闪画廊，开启IRL接触的新篇章，现在艺术家们可以和每个人分享观看和感受 NFT 艺术品的体验。\n\n网站：[https://superrare.com/](https://superrare.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com)\n\n**Foundation**\n\nFoundation 是一个去中心化平台，帮助促进NFT的现场拍卖，邀请制加入，吸引了众多1/1创作者的聚集。\n\n网站：<https://foundation.app/>\n\n**Art Blocks**\n\nArt Blocks基于以太坊，是一个能够链上生成艺术品的NFT平台。在Art Blocks中，艺术家上传脚本到以太坊智能合约，生成艺术作品。这些脚本会作为一个系列进行发行，收藏者可以购买限量的脚本，就像NFT一样。这种铸造方式让艺术品脚本拥有独特性，这样除了作品相关的NFT之外，还能产生其他艺术成果，是生成艺术家的首选市场。\n\n网站：<https://www.artblocks.io/>\n\n# 三、未来发展方向\n\nNFT作为一种可以应用于任何数字媒体的技术，在PFP收藏品和游戏领域大放异彩。但我们仍希望看见NFT作为载体如何传递反思性及批判性，以及看到数字艺术的新收藏方式解决传统艺术收藏的痛点。\n\n从JPEG summer可以借鉴的NFT应用场景：\n\n* 艺术x社区：传统收藏中藏家有同样的审美却不知道对方的存在，NFT社区已经验证了具有同样爱好和选择的藏家爆发出的力量足以将一套头像系列打造为一个品牌，这正是艺术的商业化所缺乏的早期忠实藏家群体。\n* 艺术x实用：艺术系列的成功离不开优秀的投资人，NFT将忠实藏家聚集在同一个社区，时间会为藏家筛选出哪些是值得信任且值得投资的艺术系列。Utility承诺了藏家未来的收益，随着Utility的兑现，藏家会更加信任艺术系列的未来发展，保持关注和投资。\n* 艺术x定制：PFP的大肆发行让个人资料图像逐步同质化，同样的Roadmap和类似的画风，藏家需要在市场上看到更加非同质化的NFT作品。Munko这类将艺术与藏家直接挂钩的尝试契合了市场对非同质化的需求。\n* 艺术x实物权益：与实际物品或权益关联会让NFT有根可依，实物周边、非web3的购物优惠、实物权益、展览门票等会让人眼前一亮。\n* 艺术x孵化：开启藏家的力量，共同投资艺术品共同创业，如宪法DAO的共同拍宪法、Web3 Medici帮派进行艺术资助、薯条DAO众筹开实体薯条店。\n\n艺术珍藏品线下艺术准备周期、价格；作品时与展览或单品方面联系，不收藏常藏家，同藏作品多藏品通过展位之间，不会多款作品精品展示高要求中极品，极品展品。\n\n而 NFT 适中，适合中置家收藏，策展周期连续，推特、价格等的社交媒体成为 24 小时不停歇的个人，工具及小社区正在提供现时；展览和展厅价格 NFT一个全新的艺术社区，独一无二的资源获得了更多的艺术界同样的真实保护，被许多人认可的情怀，收藏有自己的。让我们一起期待下一个夏天的实现。\n\n欢迎交流🕳\n\n推特：@bygogogo\n\n[https://twitter.com/bygogogo](https://twitter.com/bygogogo)\n\n###

“Sherlock回到贝克街，和John又处理了很多案子，由于John的博客，Sherlock渐渐成为了‘网络红人’，越来越多的人来寻求帮助，但是大部分的案子十分无聊。一天一个昏倒在贝克街的男子给他们带来了一个驴友之死的案子。”\n>\n> ——Sherlock Season 2：A Scandal in Belgravia\n\n### 解密A Hunters

格林童话《哈梅尔的吹笛人》\n\n鼠疫（黑死病），在中世纪曾使欧洲减员三分之一人口，在某些地区，这个减员率甚至超过了60%，黑死病扫过之处寸草不生，欧洲人的平均寿命下降了二十岁。\n\n为了降低受传染的几率，16世纪的法国医生Charles de Lorme（1584\\\\\\~1678），路易十三的御医发明了防传染医生套装，它长这样：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fCAb03MaPku_UxFU8skDO.png?height=600&width=292)\n\n在《血源：诅咒》**中，能够找到几个世纪前类似于黑死病的缩影，同样，也能找到同一个如上图所示的**鸟嘴形状面具。在那个死亡阴影笼罩下的中世纪欧洲，鸟嘴面具就是穿梭于黑暗中的\"幽灵\"，人们畏惧着它的到来，却又渴望得到它的救赎，邪恶与圣洁，都只在一念之间。\n\n那时，戴上鸟嘴面具的医生是神的代表。\n\n现在，戴上鸟嘴面具的CAW又在侍奉哪位真主？\n\n###

ElonMusk&Vitalik&DogeFounder\n\n在SHIB暴涨的那一年，江湖上就有人疑似挖出了疑似的相关线索。\n\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593](https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593)\n\n**结论：**\n\n1\\.Ryoshi和Vitalik线下是朋友，Vitalik和Musk线下见过面；\n\n2\\.Ryoshi最后一篇文章里，本能地举例过，在一个南非最大港口Durbs卖鱼的例子，而Musk正出身于距离Durbs不远的南非比勒陀利亚；\n\n[https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter](https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter)\n\n**结论：**\n\n3\\.狗币founder与Musk的相爱相杀，疑似其在为马斯克写代码。\n\n###

B.MoonDame\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_](https://twitter.com/moondame_)\n\n在尽可能追踪和过滤掉关联信息的同时，我们得到了上方疑似项目方对外代表的两个账号。**江湖人称：神秘夫妇。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218](https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218)\n\n我们一下就想到了，Ryoshi在2021年5月29日的最后一篇文章里，他要做稳定币SHI，并在当时已经提出了设想，同时，我们本就也知道，Ryoshi可能不止一个人，而是两个以上在运作。\n\n从其神神叨叨的推文中，我们也得知，不止一个代币，还有：\n\n### (a).$O(Childhood End)|没有推特\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end)\n\n**以及**\n\n###

End意味着童年时代的结束，同时也是SHIB时代的结束。\n\n当然，我们发现的远不止这么多，**请参考Part 5第8条，马斯克推文莎士比亚戏剧The Tempest。**\n\n**除了神秘夫妻，7月以来我们又得到了一个CAW疑似对外的窗口：**\n\n###

Part 6 Twitter 前CEO：Jack\n\n**这是另外一条故事线了。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack](https://twitter.com/jack)\n\n在推特前CEO Jack的推特背景，你会看到纯黑的Background，更仔细一点，你就能发现，这个大哥，好像十分钟情于黑色，我们来看一组证明：\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/](https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/)\n\n是不是想到了乌鸦也是黑色，当你把推特的logo颜色更换成纯黑，我们能得到一个暗黑版的推特。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q69u4LI5cnmLR1Kn7EYVC.png?height=673&width=1144)\n\n2019年12月，Jack成立了一个由5个人组成的研发小组，基于区块链开发去中心化社交协议，而这个小组的名称叫Bluesky。\n\n**再仔细一点，Bluesky的头像里你会看到一只乌鸦。**\n\n巧了不是，还有更巧的，我们接着看。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bluesky](https://twitter.com/bluesky)\n\n那一年，Jack发布了一组关于去中心化社交平台的规划：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832)\n\n可以看到，Jack希望这个去中心化推特能有自己的一套标准，能有一个**民间领袖**引领社区（对照社区发现的白皮书）。在这背后，我们并不清楚Jack与Musk此前是否可能开始了接触，但是彼时的他们饱受推特当时的各种问题，至少在境遇上相似。\n\n换句话说，前文我们所谓意淫的马斯克的这套组合拳，是否还有一部分来自于推特前CEO的Jack。在2021年之前的某个时间节点，恰逢两人一拍即合，希望能够打造去中心化推特，解放言论。\n\n2020年，没有英雄，于是他们凭空捏造了一个英雄：Ryoshi，shib当时爆火的背后，可能从来不是被老马翻牌子那么简单。\n\n前文我们提到，Ryoshi可能等于Musk，但是从其谦卑的撰文风格来看，更符合Jack。\n\n同时，他也有在南非的经历。\n\n2019年开始，至今3年的时间即将推出产品，符合开发实际。\n\n而且，从目前的马斯克收购推特来看，营销炒作是实，收购是虚，拖沓战术，剧情的走向也像是在为顺势推出去中心化推特做铺垫，只为迎来某个时间节点。\n\n然后顺着BlueSky这条线索我们找到了其CEO推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea](https://twitter.com/arcalinea)\n\n我们往前翻看推特找到了如下：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017](https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017)\n\n说巧不巧，我们又在最近CAW社区提交的一份**github**中找到了如下：\n\n[https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames](https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames)\n\n**这个魔方图案有点眼熟。**\n\n于是，我们发现，**4月17号**这天，也就是 $CAW 被创建后部署池子的那一天：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594)\n\nJack说巧不巧的发布了一个月球表情，**对应Ryoshi的推特背景，Shibarium的头像，即一轮满月。**\n\n当然，还有：\n\n[https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418)\n\n狗币创始人给了上方回复，一切尽在不言中，而一切，你知我知。\n\n**有了上方的脆弱关联指向：**\n\n于是，我们回到6月11号，**Twitter及Square创始人Jack Dorsey**旗下TBD项目开发负责人**Mike Brock**在Consensus 2022大会上宣布将**建立一个名为“Web 5”的去中心化网络平台。**\n据Mike Brock透露，Web5将为应用程序带来去中心化身份（DID）和数据存储服务，让开发人员专注于创造优质的用户体验，同时将数据和身份的所有权归还给个人。**Web 5的货币层将建立在比特币的基础上，目前仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。**\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/)\n\n还记得在链上数据那一章节，caw的部署地址曾经给自己转账留言，表示**后续会迁移流动性吗**？那时候我们对流动性的迁移一头雾水，现在来看。更像是再为迁移至比特币做冷启动准备。又或者真的是QOM的L1，鬼知道呢？\n\n###

Part 6 Twitter 前CEO：Jack\n\n**这是另外一条故事线了。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack](https://twitter.com/jack)\n\n在推特前CEO Jack的推特背景，你会看到纯黑的Background，更仔细一点，你就能发现，这个大哥，好像十分钟情于黑色，我们来看一组证明：\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/](https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/)\n\n是不是想到了乌鸦也是黑色，当你把推特的logo颜色更换成纯黑，我们能得到一个暗黑版的推特。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q69u4LI5cnmLR1Kn7EYVC.png?height=673&width=1144)\n\n2019年12月，Jack成立了一个由5个人组成的研发小组，基于区块链开发去中心化社交协议，而这个小组的名称叫Bluesky。\n\n**再仔细一点，Bluesky的头像里你会看到一只乌鸦。**\n\n巧了不是，还有更巧的，我们接着看。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bluesky](https://twitter.com/bluesky)\n\n那一年，Jack发布了一组关于去中心化社交平台的规划：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832)\n\n可以看到，Jack希望这个去中心化推特能有自己的一套标准，能有一个**民间领袖**引领社区（对照社区发现的白皮书）。在这背后，我们并不清楚Jack与Musk此前是否可能开始了接触，但是彼时的他们饱受推特当时的各种问题，至少在境遇上相似。\n\n换句话说，前文我们所谓意淫的马斯克的这套组合拳，是否还有一部分来自于推特前CEO的Jack。在2021年之前的某个时间节点，恰逢两人一拍即合，希望能够打造去中心化推特，解放言论。\n\n2020年，没有英雄，于是他们凭空捏造了一个英雄：Ryoshi，shib当时爆火的背后，可能从来不是被老马翻牌子那么简单。\n\n前文我们提到，Ryoshi可能等于Musk，但是从其谦卑的撰文风格来看，更符合Jack。\n\n同时，他也有在南非的经历。\n\n2019年开始，至今3年的时间即将推出产品，符合开发实际。\n\n而且，从目前的马斯克收购推特来看，营销炒作是实，收购是虚，拖沓战术，剧情的走向也像是在为顺势推出去中心化推特做铺垫，只为迎来某个时间节点。\n\n然后顺着BlueSky这条线索我们找到了其CEO推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea](https://twitter.com/arcalinea)\n\n我们往前翻看推特找到了如下：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017](https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017)\n\n说巧不巧，我们又在最近CAW社区提交的一份**github**中找到了如下：\n\n[https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames](https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames)\n\n**这个魔方图案有点眼熟。**\n\n于是，我们发现，**4月17号**这天，也就是

Dorsey**旗下TBD项目开发负责人**Mike Brock**在Consensus 2022大会上宣布将**建立一个名为“Web 5”的去中心化网络平台。**\n据Mike Brock透露，Web5将为应用程序带来去中心化身份（DID）和数据存储服务，让开发人员专注于创造优质的用户体验，同时将数据和身份的所有权归还给个人。**Web 5的货币层将建立在比特币的基础上，目前仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。**\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/)\n\n还记得在链上数据那一章节，caw的部署地址曾经给自己转账留言，表示**后续会迁移流动性吗**？那时候我们对流动性的迁移一头雾水，现在来看。更像是再为迁移至比特币做冷启动准备。又或者真的是QOM的L1，鬼知道呢？\n\n###

{"id": "GWTaFhquhPQhlWrhnnhVQfXlc2Hn0ogSmS86jr7lwq8", "title": "跟着V神，初探SBTs", "body": "## SBT是什么\n\n是最早由V神在2022年1月提出的。全称为灵魂绑定代币Soul bound Token，是不可转让的非同质化代币（NFT），绑定在灵魂账户soul address中，可以简单理解为一种社会属性的凭证，代表个人用户独有的身份、声誉、资格等等。\n\nSoul bound灵魂绑定，最大特征就是不可转让性，最早是源自魔兽世界里。\n\n*一些有超能力的游戏物品都是灵魂绑定的，是不可以转移或售卖给别人的。所以玩家想获得这些超能力，不能通过购买，只能靠自己去杀死对应的怪物来获得他们的超能力）。可以这样理解，SBTs更多是非金融化的，不是用来交易的，是用来个人身份识别为主的。*\n\n## Soul bound的意义价值\n\n社会经济价值创造很大部分是基于人类关系网络和社会信用体系。而在当前的web3中，是缺乏社会身份这一元素的。所以，当前web3发展是存在局限性的。\n\nSoul bound技术，能给当前缺失“社会身份”的web3.0带来社会身份，可以创建web3.0的信用体系。有了web3社会身份，就会有使得更多政治、经济、文化上更多用例产生，建立新的多元化的生态系统，建立“去中心化社会（DeSoc）”。\n\n## Soul bound目前应用方向\n\n* **传统NFT领域**\n\n  现在很多NFT（游戏道具/艺术品），都具备一定特殊稀缺价值和社交属性，但由于其可交易性，这些NFT更多彰显的是财富资产（能支付得起某某）。 Soul bound可以让NFT去金融化，持有某NFT，可以代表更多个人的特质，体现持有人本身具备了怎样的亲身经历/技能，或者是说通过持有NFT而支持某某领域，比如慈善项目NFT等。\n\n  *已有的应用——POAP： the \"proof of attendance protocol\"，出席证明协议，代表了持有人参与了某事件/活动，或对此有过一定的贡献。*\n\n  *活动方/品牌方/项目方（Issuers），可以在POAP平台上创建自己的活动（需要经过平台方的中心化的审核）。用户（collectors），可以通过参与线上或线下如discord社区会议等各类活动后，领取POAP徽章。（从项目方那获取mint链接，或者去POAP官网，去查询是否有领取资格）*\n\n  *POAP mint发行，可以是线下机构，目前线上的项目方主要为元宇宙/游戏类项目为主，也有一定的Defi类项目。其中，比较有名的是元宇宙项目Decentraland（很多品牌方的POAP可以在里面认领）。关于交易方面，POAP本身妥协了，态度上是不鼓励徽章变成金融化的转让交易，徽章应作为承载和见证记录个体链上的美好生活的。但其底层技术上是支持可转让。目前，POAP 的二级市场是在Eporio（在XDAI也就是Gnosis链上的）。可以进行发送或者买卖交易。*\n\n  另一个与NFT结合的方式是，当前NFT作品来源及稀缺性，往往由NFT市场权威上架保证。但未来，如果越来越多艺术家们能打造自身身份的souls账户，那么集结越多souls凭证的NFT作品，更能和伪造品区分开来。\n* **在Souldrops & DAO领域**\n\n  传统的项目方发币空投，往往给到符合一定空投要求的一堆地址。用户获得空投后，很多就在二级市场套利变现。Souldrops可以改进当下的空投和DAO。最基础的作用就是，可以将SBTs来标识钱包，则可以区分机器人地址，降低女巫攻击，避免空投过于集中化或者囤积代币获取投票权。\n\n  进一步地，SBTs可以纳入空投的要求，得到更精准地用户识别，来筛选要空投激励的对象，找到更贴合项目发展目标或宗旨的用户，这样比一般常规的空投计划目的性更强。也可以让普通空投代币设计转化SBTs，发放后在一定时间内，不可转让性生效，也就意味着治理权是被锁定不可交易的，之后可以由不可转让变为最终可转让的代币。也可以相反，让前期可转让的普通代币，之后可以解锁成为SBTs。这样做的目的，都是鼓励长期持有参与社区自治，降低项目代币的投机性参与度。另外，SBTs间存在一定相关性，所以在DAO方面也可以尝试通过降低相关性高的SBTs的权重，以此来让少数派也有发言的权利，或者是给与由更多特殊SBTs的群体更多投票权。\n\n  总之，整体而言，无论是airdrop还是更广泛的DAO治理，soulbound都有很大的设计空间，来激励社区自治。\n\n  *相关的应用——Proof-of-Humanity Protocol人类证明：允许链上事务与人类证明绑定。可以在智能合约上建立人类档案，原始所有者可以上传视频，如果后面得到视频不一致，则抵押资产就会移除掉。通过提交个人认证视频，经过他人担保后成功注册，形成抗女巫攻击的人类名单。对DAO创新治理、个人声誉建立、抗女巫攻击的代币空投等都有好处。*\n\n\n* **在Defi Lending领域**\n\n  传统社会的无抵押借贷，是基于信用评级机制的，这个在当前web3.0是很难存在的。而借助soulbound，可以根据个人信誉发展信用抵押。\n\n  *相关的应用——CreDA Protocol：在传统defi的lending中引入了链上信用评级，将用户信用档案铸造成cNFT，从而使得借贷平台可根据cNFT等级，给予不同优惠利率或激励措施，提供个性化借贷服务。同时用户还可以基于信用评分加入信用网络，参与到信贷担保业务。CreDA 的信用评分是基于用户链上资产规模、参与Defi项目的链上行为活跃程度、参与Lending平台的贷款偿还记录等。*\n\n## Soul bound的社会恢复机制\n\n关于souls钱包地址和其中的SBTs，如果丢失，目前提倡的技术方案是将通过社会恢复Social recovery甚至是community recovery来实现的。对于普通的Social recovery，找回成功与否，在于与监护人“guardians'' 的信任关系是否还健康持久。更佳的方式是，把souls的恢复从由简单的Social recovery变为SBT community recovery，也就由那些SBTs相关的souls 或者说是背后归属的community，让他们来参与恢复。让souls钱包找回是基于souls关系网络的。当前，绝大多数web3.0的钱包，是不适用的SBTs，因为对于要承载一个人的身份的钱包来说，一定是要可以实现身份恢复的，而非是一旦遗失私钥无法恢复。因此像Argent 和 Loopring 这样的非监护式社会恢复钱包，可以进行这块的探索。另外，正是因为这种社会网络下的恢复机制，也间接保证了souls的出售，因为出售的话，卖方是没办法保证他不会再去恢复的。\n\n## Soul bound的隐私设计\n\n当前链上数据全部公开，但如果广泛运用后SBTs，多种SBTs映射成了一个个人像图谱，链上活动就会更加反映一个个具象的个体、有身份的人类活动，存在信息过度公开化。那么，对身份隐私性的保护也会更加重要。\n\n目前相关隐私保护和数据授权的技术方案有以下几种：\n\n1）SBTs存在于链下，但提交SBTs的哈希值给到链上。由持有人自行决定何时公开。（储存在链下，持有人自行寸尺，由索引、收件人地址、收件人secret所得到得哈希值。只有公开secret和给收件人他们的Merkle 分支，外界才能够看到持有哪些物品。）\n\n2）运用零知识证明加密技术“zero knowledge proofs”。证明持有，但不透露过多信息比如个人身份。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dblXoG9tQSKcBWJpRKHFz.png?height=355&width=481)\n\n## Soulboud未来\n\n* 实践道阻且长，soulbound是DeSoc的起点而非终点，会把web3推向新型社会信用网络。而针对Soulbond的最主要的标志性特征-不可转让，过程中会有不同程度的“不可以转让交易”尝试或者是妥协实现。如当下有的将NFT和ENS绑定，则有的人会因为在意其ENS，而选择不转移NFT，从而一定程度实现了不可转让性。又如，前期可实现具有可撤销的功能，也就是可以通过一定身份认证进行撤销和重新发行，成为可撤销、可转让的代币。这样，间接降低SBTs被金融化出售的可能性。", "timestamp": 1658067788, "digest": "YrmfXTp6lTRHB-F6eA9oEea_8-pN2KVKnE8VDQkf6TI", "contributor": "0x133C06D8CF2e9571F641e6c50BfEa9C9B944589c"}

{"id": "5_NfTZsyjYbOg3qnUe5vxBUIfuSr9adCrwTNm59DxT4", "title": "一文了解艺术品NFT", "body": "持续近一年的JPEG summer落下帷幕，自去年6月以来，NFT市场的交易额首次低于10亿美元，许多受欢迎的系列价格都有一定幅度的下跌，市场正在经历考验。\n\n“Autoglyphs”地板价从100ETH回弹至300，GmDAO出品Factura by Mathias Isaksen、GODA出品的Nina's Super Cool World上线即霸榜，艺术类NFT的爆发力不容小觑。\n\n去年4月开始，NFT场景开始爆发，大量艺术家及个人创作者加入NFT创作，NFT生态逐渐繁荣。但另一方面，随着BAYC模式的成功，PFP NFT开始成为 NFT 社区和整个市场的代表，经过一年的酝酿PFP的同质化问题暴露了出来，NFT场景扩张陷入阻滞。与此同时，艺术品NFT仍未大范围进入普通加密藏家投资组合，艺术品NFT相较于PFP NFT及现代艺术品收藏市场均处于早期。\n\n在此份报告中，将对NFT艺术收藏品进行梳理，其中包括NFT市场概况、2021年以来的NFT重要事件、艺术NFT发展现状、未来发展方向等。列举数十个艺术NFT项目，以展现这一赛道的基本情况。\n\n## 一、NFT市场\n\n### 1.市场市场\n\n根据DappRadar报告，2021年NFT 的总净销售额接近250亿美元，整体市场与2020年相比增长了 26,000% 以上。\n\n![2021 NFT sales](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3hZhs3cyA7gv1140SxXtq.png?height=764&width=1370)\n\n2020 年传统艺术品和古董的销售额达到 500 亿美元，NFT市值正在飞速接近人们买卖实体艺术品的传统艺术市场。而佳士得和苏富比等拥有数百年历史的传统艺术品拍卖行，已经加入NFT热潮售出价值数百万美元的 NFT。\n\nNFT 市场的广泛繁荣为个人卖家带来了数百万美元的利润。NonFungible.com表示，NFT 交易员通过买卖 NFT 赚取了超过 54 亿美元的总利润。在去年参与购买 NFT 的大约 200 万个活跃钱包中，其中 473 个产生了至少 100 万美元的利润。\n\n进入 2022 年，NFT 市场保持强劲。2022年至今（7月17日）NFT市场交易额727万ETH，198万个钱包交易NFT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hjbCAdBnc2a7v3RnRs96r.png?height=816&width=2154)\n\n### 2.赛场\n\n大多数 NFT 和项目目前属于 以下6 个类别，其中大部分属于收藏品和实用程序：艺术、收藏品、赌博、元宇宙、实用程序、所有权证明。\n\n**艺术：**现实生活中的艺术家（包括数字原生艺术家和传统艺术家）的实际艺术作品\n\n**收藏品：**主要指PFP项目，这些项目具有不同程度的稀有性。\n\n**游戏：**游戏中这些可以是在单独使用的 NFT，或者 NFT 可能是游戏本身的基础。\n\n**Metaverse：**类似于游戏，尽管这些与不一定应用游戏机制的数字世界有关。\n\n**实用程序：**任何提供当前或未来实际功能的 NFT，例如服务、会员资格或对内容的访问都属于Utility类别。\n\n**所有权证明：**这仍然是一个相对较新的类别，但我们已经看到汽车制造商和时装公司在有限系列中将这些作为所有权证明引入。\n\n一个项目可能同时归属于多个类别，被分类为什么项目取决于它们在路线图中的哪个阶段。\n\n### 3. 各场市场交易额\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dbt0D4hQCCcWN73xyg6wE.png?height=940&width=1334)\n\n根据已统计的176亿美元NFT销售额比例，各赛道交易额及占比如下：\n\n**收藏品：**84.7亿美元，占48.1%\n\n**游戏：**51.8亿美元，占29.4%\n\n**艺术：**28亿美元，占15.9%\n\n**实用程序：**5.3亿美元，占3%\n\n**元宇宙：**5.13亿美元，占2.9%\n\n收藏品和游戏是导致去年 NFT 交易激增的两个类别。仅收藏品就产生了超过 84 亿美元的销售额。收藏品和游戏两个类别发行模式趋于成熟，新的突破口将集中在其他类别，如艺术、实用程序、元宇宙。\n\n# 二、NFT大事件\n\n### 1.Crypto Punnks：NFT OG\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VVAQq8Vsi86nMRCHtJYy9.png?height=1016&width=1398)\n\nCryptoPunks由 Matt Hall 和 John Watkinson 于 2017 年创建，主形象是像素朋克，被认为是首批创建并免费提供的 NFT 系列。CryptoPunks的价值在 2021年1 月份开始飙升，有些甚至达到了 100 万美元。\n\n很快，有些punks的价格超过 1100 万美元，几乎不再有人能买得起CrypyoPunks。作为以太坊有史以来第一批NFT之一，它以20.2亿美元的总市值位列NFT项目排行榜第一，累计持有者3543人，迄今项目最高价值作品是于2021年10月29日交易的CryptoPunks#9998，售价达到5.3亿美元。NFT的序幕正式拉开。\n\n### 2.Beeple：著名拍卖行首次提供NFT\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QmRhxVrfFKwQo6gWhc1xH.png?height=946&width=1570)\n\nBeeple从2007年5月1日开始，每天创作一幅数字作品，不间断地持续13年半将它们集合为“Everydays: The first 5000 days”。当Beeple在佳士得以 6900 万美元的价格售出“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”时，一切都变了,天价使他成为世界上第三贵的在世艺术家。\n\n虽然 NFT 的价格足以令人留下深刻的印象，但这是著名拍卖行首次提供 NFT，仅此一项就为新兴的 NFT 市场带来了有力的支持，在当时看来，它随时可能仅仅成为一个小众的互联网热点。但这次拍卖有效地进入了大众视野，表明 NFT 不仅仅是昙花一现。\n\n佳士得艺术专家诺亚戴维斯说：”我们正处在一个可能会发生巨大转变的时刻，吸引年轻收藏家的东西完全变了，人口转变和代际转变成了我们最注意的事“。\n\n这次竞拍总计有33位竞标，其中有91%从未参与该平台的竞标，这些竞标者超过半数（58%）的竞标者为千禧世代（1981年-1996年），他们增长于信息科技爆发的年代，还有33%为出生于1965年至1980年，而“婴儿潮世代”（出生于1946—1964年）的竞标者为 3%，数量是Z世代（出生于1995-2009年）竞标者的一半。很显然NFT成为了打开千禧一代和Z世代年轻收藏家收藏之门的钥匙。\n\n### 3.Bored Ape Yacht Club：JPEG summer和PFP崛起\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A8Cr83EU1gOQo2wGwQHuc.png?height=892&width=880)\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club(以下简写“BAYC”)是一个 NFT 头像项目，主形象是一个无聊的猿猴，搭配各种表情和配饰。从 NFT 头像起步，它建立了活跃的社区文化，形成了品牌效应，收购了老牌 NFT 项目 Cryptopunks 和 Meebits，成为 NFT 头像类项目的龙头\\*\\*。\\*\\*随后，建立 ApeCoin DAO，发行代币 APE，将打造元宇宙空间，建设 NFT 头像、区块链游戏等生态发展空间。BAYC 横跨至元宇宙赛道，寻求新的发展空间。\n\n随着“BAYC”的成功，一些类似的项目开始涌现，因为它们通常强调可用作社交媒体头像，这些项目被称为profile-pic NFT (PFP NFT)。PFP NFT 在夏季开始主导市场，交易的热度让收藏家将这个夏季称为 JPEG 夏季。\n\nPFP NFT成为NFT 社区和整个市场的代表，这引起了外部评论家的愤怒，他们认为PFP对市场的主导地位证明了 NFT 缺乏艺术价值。\n\n## 4.MFers：CC0的去中心化品牌建设实验\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7reex470uzmUbv-ZoLobi.png?height=946&width=1476)\n\n出于对Yuga Labs等头部项目版权限制的不满，CC0 NFT（Creative Commons 0 NFT）应运而生，Mfers、Cryptoadz、Blitmap和Nouns等NFT项目为持有者提供了更大的自由：可以不购买NFT、可以随意改造图片、可以使用logo和品牌、可以随意做任何你想做的事。\n\nMFers的成功是相当独特的，因为它没有Utility，也没有路线图。Sartoshi表示“我所设想的 MFers 世界将集中体现‘我们都是 MFers’这个简单的想法。没有国王、统治者或明确的路线图——MFers 可以用这些 MFers 构建他们能想到的任何东西。”\n\n在今年6月9日创始人Sartoshi宣布离开MFers的社区，自此MFers走上了完全的去中心化品牌建设之路，没有任何人拥有版权，每个人都拥有版权，在人们对MFers的创作过程中每一个MFers持有人都将因为品牌价值的提升而从中获益。这种众筹的品牌建设模式会走向何方？相信时间会给出完美的答案。\n\n## 5.Fidenza：Artblocks与NFT的艺术用途\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-0JhpSlKPcYt06OasG1JM.png?height=1086&width=906)\n\n生成艺术家Tyler Hobbs的NFT项目“Fidenza”于6月在NFT平台Art Blocks上线。“Fidenza”由Hobbs设计的算法随机生成，并包含丰富多彩的曲线和方块，发行后大获成功，其中Fidenza #313 以 1,000 ETH（购买时为 330 万美元）易手，爆火后为Artblocks平台每天带来数百万美元的交易量。\n\n尽管加密艺术和数字艺术有着悠久的历史，但 ArtBlocks 是第一个将艺术NFT成功推向主流NFT得到成功的，它获得了其他加密艺术家的支持。\n\n## 6.Pak's Merge : 概念与商业的碰撞\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QstTh7ilS82yoOXBz0vUs.png?height=1164&width=2532)\n\n数字艺术家 Pak 的作品在过去一年中一直畅销，去年12 月初，他的作品 “Merge”将他的市场推向了新的高度。在 12月2日至4日期间，他在Nifty Gateway 上以 9180 万美元的总价售出了 250,000 个“mass units”。\n\n让这次拍卖令人印象深刻的不是它所要求的价格，而是他使用区块链技术创造了一个巨大的概念艺术作品。在售出这些units后，Nifty Gateway将它们铸造为 NFT，合并每个买家的units。例如，购买 100 个批量单位的买家与购买 10,000 个的买家拥有不同的 NFT。而且每次购买Merge NFT 时，它都会与现有的Merge合并，减少NFT数量\\*。\\*\n\nNifty Gateway宣传Pak是最昂贵的在世艺术家，甚至超过Jeff Koons。\n\n## 7.NFT.NYC：步入IRL\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G2hwAEuXO5AcGaG9M9kMB.png?height=1134&width=1752)\n\nNFT.NYC是由Jodee Rich和Cameron Bale早在2018年创立，今年已经进入了第四个年头，他们想将NFT创作者和收藏者聚集在一起，今年涵盖了超过16个领域，包括艺术、摄影、音乐和电影等。本次NFT NYC有超过15,000名与会者注册了会议，而去年这个数字只有5,000左右。\n\nNFT 社区的成员从世界各地飞来，在纽约市与 IRL 会面。NFT 社区庞大而充满活力一直被认为完全是线上的。但NFT.NYC让更多的人看到了NFT的的线下财力，无数的场地被出租给独家和豪华的派对，收藏家、爱好者和更多人一起陶醉于这场NFT盛会。\n\n从CryptoPunks到“Everydays”，NFT正式进入艺术投资市场占有一席之地；从BAYC到MFers到NFT.NYC，归属于holders的商业版权放开，品牌打造方式逐步丰富，NFT影响力从线上转向线下；Artblocks促进生成艺术的繁荣，PAK将概念艺术推向大众视野，Jeff Koons宣布正在筹备自己的NFT，越来越多的艺术家开始进行加密结合的艺术创作。\n\n# 二、艺术NFT发展现状\n\n## 1.艺术NFT项目\n\n艺术品NFT主要分为以下几类，同一个项目可能同时归属于多个类别，这取决于它们在路线图中的哪个阶段。\n\n* **静态艺术**\n\n静态艺术通常是专门从事平面创作的图形艺术家的选择，也是传统艺术家的首选，他们将自己的实体作品制作副本并符号化。在这里，我们介绍上面提到过的主流拍卖行的NFT拍卖里程碑艺术家——Beeple。\n\n**Beeple**\n\n代表作品：\n\n“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”，在佳士得以 6900 万美元的价格售出。\n\n在“Everydays: The First 5,000 Days”中，Beeple将反复出现的主题和配色方案拼接成一个整体。反复出现的主题包括社会对技术的痴迷和恐惧；对财富的渴望和怨恨；以及美国的政治动荡。\n\n* **GIFs/视频**\n\n除静态NFT外，你还可以经常看到一些GIF和视频NFT作品。GIF和视频可以结合动画和声音，借此艺术家可以创造出融合视觉和听觉体验的沉浸式作品，更深刻的打造作品中的场景。\n\n**XCOPY**\n\nXCOPY 来自伦敦，是一位“长期主义数字艺术家和加密爱好者”，加密艺术界的原生黑帮。作为SuperRare上的原创艺术家，他在Nifty Gateway上大获成功，XCOPY 是 NFT 艺术社区的领导者。\n\nXCOPY 通常专注于类似风格的单版、1/1 作品，其中一些作品的标题评论NFT文化和时事评论——例如Right Click 和 Save As Guy和All-Time High in the City。随着NFT市场的增长，这些作品和其他作品的价值越来越高。\n\n今年3月，XCOPY的Max Pain NFT的公开版本在10分钟内以价值2300 万美元售出，而这两天Grifters by XCOPY的地板价从10ETH小小的涨到了20ETH，众巨鲸集体晒单，黑帮仍在席卷整个NFT社区。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0MAqERAqkwQ5c3Si9eR4.png?height=810&width=1448)\n\n**Mad Dog Jones**\n\nMad Dog Jones将音乐和艺术结合在一起，创造了符合动态、适应性和超现实概念的艺术作品。他的艺术作品是赛博朋克式的城市建筑或街道场景。他已售出1567件NFT艺术品，平均每件9063.52美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9x3g8i3EeMQWprMLWX5gX.png?height=1282&width=1280)\n\n代表作品：\n\n“REPLICATOR”，以 410 万美元的价格售出。REPLICATOR NFT 项目每 28 天产生新的艺术品。第一代 NFT 产生了六个新的 NFT，六个中的每个产生五个，就像复印机一样，这样的生成会一直持续到第七代，买家最终可以拥有180到220个独特的NFT，每个都可以再次出售产生价值。\n\n“Crash + burn”，以390万美元的价格售出。\n\n* **摄影**\n\n我们经常可以看到网络上的优秀摄影作品，当我们想收藏数字摄影作品时，我们能想到的往往是保存下来或者购买摄影作品集。\n\nNFT的出现让摄影作品可以被直接收藏，上传同时即可为作品进行确权，也可以便于藏家收藏。\n\n**Cath Simard**\n\n代表作品：\n\n“FreeHawaii”， 以100ETH被知名的NFT收藏家Gmoney收藏。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tbqiI_DRvmljscaXmCHKG.png?height=1348&width=1082)\n\n2017年Cath Simard拍摄了一张夏威夷孤独道路的照片。她在Instagram账户上发布后，照片很快被转载盗用但却未被标明原作者，而Simard在多次起诉侵权者后仍无法得到任何金钱赔偿。最终她决定在SuperRare上将这张照片作为NFT来铸造，并在购买后向公众公布照片的使用权。FreeHawaii照片现在是最著名的NFT摄影作品之一。\n\n* **生成艺术**\n\n**Autoglyphs by Larva Labs**\n\nLarva Labs2019年创作的Autoglyphs，加密社区中的许多人认为这是第一个链上生成艺术收藏品。上周价格回弹至300ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dEugdYpvY70m7bmUtr-Pj.png?height=1070&width=1096)\n\n**Artblocks策展系列**\n\n由 Art Blocks 策展委员会批准的收藏。它们最能代表平台的官方愿景，按季度发布。Fidenza、Ringers是让人印象深刻的系列。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lOgLDsm4wSYFpYyLXHgqm.png?height=1090&width=906)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BolRLEgX-mIAhP5BFVKNA.png?height=898&width=894)\n\n* **艺术收藏品**\n\n**Hashmasks**\n\nHashmasks是一个由全球70多位艺术家共同创作的合作性艺术项目，于2021年1月启动，共有16384个独特的Hashmasks。这是 NFT 历史上第一次允许每个收藏品由买家命名的数字艺术收藏品，藏家可以使用空投的NCT代币为收藏品命名，每个收藏品的价值由艺术品的创作者及其消费者共同决定。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UOa2aYVglk4Ia1inEnJFn.png?height=1254&width=894)\n\n总量：16,384\n\n地板价：0.388ETH\n\n持有人数：5.2k\n\n网站：<https://www.thehashmasks.com/>\n\nOpensea：<https://opensea.io/collection/hashmasks>\n\n**Murakami.Flowers**\n\n艺术家村上隆的代表作品——花卉，以点状艺术的形式表现出来，让人想起

2.艺术家社区\n\n### JPG社区\n\n* 介绍：\n\n  jpg.space立志成为加密世界的 Tumblr。用户可以导入和显示 OpenSea上可用的任何 NFT，以策划自己的画廊。他们希望人们从精心策划的画廊中找到价值，NFT已经成为财富聚集的游戏，如果你没有钱你很难在社区中定位自己，他们希望人们可以在NFT世界中发现更多的价值。\n\n  JPG社区是由收藏家、策展人、创作者构成的策展社区，允许每个人创建 NFT 展览。通过信誉系统衡量每个人对策展网络的贡献，发展具有内部声誉系统的去中心化社区。\n* 团队：\n\n  jpg.space由 Fernandez 和联合创始人 Trent Elmore 和 Sam Spike 于 去年7 月推出，在今年1月的种子轮融资中获得 380 万美元。\n* 网站：\n\n  <https://jpg.space/>\n\n### GODA\n\n* 介绍：\n\n  GODA是艺术家与藏家社区，以GODA PASS作为准入门槛。GODA与传统艺术家在数字艺术空间中密切合作，帮助他们在社交媒体传达自己的创作语言。确保合作艺术家无缝、有影响力的投放，尊重他们的艺术价值。对收藏家提供市场上最好的收藏品。\n\n  GODA 团队策划了一个收藏品系列，其中包括来自传统艺术界的知名人物以及GODA的合作艺术家。\n* 团队：\n\n  GODA团队由消费者、艺术、音乐、NFT 和时尚领域知名人士领导。包括：Nina Chanel Abney、Shaun Neff、Pharrell Williams、KAWS等。\n* 网站：\n\n  <https://thegoda.io/>\n\n## 3.艺术NFT市场\n\n**SuperRare**\n\nSuperRare帮助艺术收藏降低门槛，建立一个值得信赖的社区，让艺术家可以直接接触买家。长期以来艺术收藏市场一直是不透明且排他性的市场，大多数人无法进入。SuperRare让数字艺术首次能以大规模公开的方式在线发售。拍卖的每一件作品都经过身份验证，并被标记为任何人都可以拥有和交易的加密收藏数字物品。所有交易均使用以太坊网络上的原生加密货币以太币进行。\n\n近期，SuperRare在纽约 SoHo 区的 417 West Broadway 开设快闪画廊，开启IRL接触的新篇章，现在艺术家们可以和每个人分享观看和感受 NFT 艺术品的体验。\n\n网站：[https://superrare.com/](https://superrare.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com)\n\n**Foundation**\n\nFoundation 是一个去中心化平台，帮助促进NFT的现场拍卖，邀请制加入，吸引了众多1/1创作者的聚集。\n\n网站：<https://foundation.app/>\n\n**Art Blocks**\n\nArt Blocks基于以太坊，是一个能够链上生成艺术品的NFT平台。在Art Blocks中，艺术家上传脚本到以太坊智能合约，生成艺术作品。这些脚本会作为一个系列进行发行，收藏者可以购买限量的脚本，就像NFT一样。这种铸造方式让艺术品脚本拥有独特性，这样除了作品相关的NFT之外，还能产生其他艺术成果，是生成艺术家的首选市场。\n\n网站：<https://www.artblocks.io/>\n\n# 三、未来发展方向\n\nNFT作为一种可以应用于任何数字媒体的技术，在PFP收藏品和游戏领域大放异彩。但我们仍希望看见NFT作为载体如何传递反思性及批判性，以及看到数字艺术的新收藏方式解决传统艺术收藏的痛点。\n\n从JPEG summer可以借鉴的NFT应用场景：\n\n* 艺术x社区：传统收藏中藏家有同样的审美却不知道对方的存在，NFT社区已经验证了具有同样爱好和选择的藏家爆发出的力量足以将一套头像系列打造为一个品牌，这正是艺术的商业化所缺乏的早期忠实藏家群体。\n* 艺术x实用：艺术系列的成功离不开优秀的投资人，NFT将忠实藏家聚集在同一个社区，时间会为藏家筛选出哪些是值得信任且值得投资的艺术系列。Utility承诺了藏家未来的收益，随着Utility的兑现，藏家会更加信任艺术系列的未来发展，保持关注和投资。\n* 艺术x定制：PFP的大肆发行让个人资料图像逐步同质化，同样的Roadmap和类似的画风，藏家需要在市场上看到更加非同质化的NFT作品。Munko这类将艺术与藏家直接挂钩的尝试契合了市场对非同质化的需求。\n* 艺术x实物权益：与实际物品或权益关联会让NFT有根可依，实物周边、非web3的购物优惠、实物权益、展览门票等会让人眼前一亮。\n* 艺术x孵化：开启藏家的力量，共同投资艺术品共同创业，如宪法DAO的共同拍宪法、Web3 Medici帮派进行艺术资助、薯条DAO众筹开实体薯条店。\n\n艺术珍藏品线下艺术准备周期、价格；作品时与展览或单品方面联系，不收藏常藏家，同藏作品多藏品通过展位之间，不会多款作品精品展示高要求中极品，极品展品。\n\n而 NFT 适中，适合中置家收藏，策展周期连续，推特、价格等的社交媒体成为 24 小时不停歇的个人，工具及小社区正在提供现时；展览和展厅价格 NFT一个全新的艺术社区，独一无二的资源获得了更多的艺术界同样的真实保护，被许多人认可的情怀，收藏有自己的。让我们一起期待下一个夏天的实现。\n\n欢迎交流🕳\n\n推特：@bygogogo\n\n[https://twitter.com/bygogogo](https://twitter.com/bygogogo)\n\n###

{"id": "U-6TgzvsIAqFnbpWYlsuGjfpxU0hSiT1PpZAHpoRkLI", "title": "After 4 Years of Sobriety, I Want A Damn Drink", "body": "It’s Christmas Eve. I lead myself on a run through Boston. Along the Charles River, through Harvard Square, south down Mass Ave., and along the esplanade up until Charles Street.\n\nNear the Boston Garden, my fingertips begin to tingle. I remind myself to get better gloves and tuck into a cafe on Boylston Street for tea. It’s 11 am.\n\nThe table of 4 to my right is finishing brunch. They’re at the stage where the server has their card, and its owner is sending itemized Venmo requests. The omelets are gone, some hash browns remain, their coffee is cold, and the champagne bottles are empty. There’s still some orange juice left in their carafe. \n\nThe server returns with their card and wishes them a happy holiday. Scarves wrap necks, hats cover ears, and the group exits. I leave shortly after them.\n\nI travel home passively listening to a podcast. Something about the future of work. I undress, shower, slip into an all-grey sweatsuit tucked into a pair of red socks, and sink into the cushions that form the L on my couch. I’m sipping Jasmine Green tea, a cold second cup from the pot I brewed this morning, scanning pages of Range, a book advocating for being a generalist. \n\nA walking tour of Paris is playing on the TV. We have 5 pm dinner reservations tonight, the first full family dinner since before the pandemic. Then we’ll go to an Aunt’s for an immersive Italian celebration. The Ricotta cookies will test my discipline, the games of left-right-center will lose me money.\n\nI’m passively listening, passively reading, and passively watching because the true focus of my mind is what it would be like to have a drink right now.\n\nThe sun is peeking in through a front bay window, highlighting the dust on my coffee table. Several candles burn, a cheap one crackles. I’ve fully embraced Hygge, the Danish and Norwegian word for a mood of coziness. Today is a rare opportunity to do absolutely nothing.\n\nHow nice would a day buzz be right now, I allow myself to say out loud. Chilled Vinho Verde or maybe Mimosas. I can’t stop thinking about how well it would complement this scene, of the immediate release it would send throughout my body.\n\nThen comes the idea of sharing a glass of Tuscan Red with my dad, sister, and new brother-in-law. How it would feel to pass through my Aunt’s threshold matching the energy of 30+ Italians. Saying yes to waiters, Uncles, and friends, is more appealing than the silent signal that turning over a glass sends.\n\nThe idea of getting drunk is intoxicating.\n\nThe chorus of a Nathaniel Ratcliffe song pulses through my mind, *“Son of a B\\*tch, Give me a drink.”*\n\nI stand and walk to the kitchen.\n\nI reach into the cabinet for a glass.\n\nI open the fridge, grab, and unscrew a bottle.\n\nI fix ice cubes into a glass.\n\nI empty the bottle into the glass.\n\nThe ice cubes pop as the sparkling water lands on them.\n\nThe idea of getting drunk is intoxicating, but not worth it.\n\n**_____**\n\nI sometimes wonder if I deprive myself of pleasure. If self-imposed commitments or restrictions rob me of what Anthony Bourdain called an appetite for life.\n\nI attempt to find comforting language to confirm my abstinent decision.\n\nInstead, I find Karl Marx:\n\n> *“The less you eat, drink, buy books, go to the theatre or to balls, or to the pub, and the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you will be able to save and the greater will become your treasure which neither moth nor rust will corrupt — your capital. The less you are, the less you express your life, the more you have, the greater is your alienated life and the greater is the saving of your alienated being.”*\n\nNow I question if I am not only depriving myself but also alienating myself.\n\nDoes not drinking rob me of pleasure, experiences, *and* friendships?\n\nI do experience loneliness, though I have been crediting that to the pandemic and a recent reshuffling.\n\nI’m open to the idea of being wrong. It excites me.\n\nI extend the scope of my evaluation.\n\nDoes veganism rob me of satisfaction, invitations, and cultural experiences?\n\nDoes sleep cause me to miss out on the adventures of the moon, late nights with friends, strangers, and sweat, and career advancements?\n\nDoes monogamy rob me of excitement, thrill, and pleasure? Does it insult the fantasies of my mind?\n\nMy list runs longer.\n\nAdam Grant has encouraged me to [find joy in being wrong](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/adam-grants-blueprint-for-receiving-feedback-17197cfe73a). Today, there is nothing in my life that I believe to be absolute. There is no opinion, no commitment, no conviction that I cling to. Every part of me is available for updates. For upgrades. That’s why I’m even able to ask if my sobriety is depriving me of pleasure.\n\nThe truth is that yes, all of the above *do* deprive me of pleasure.\n\nAt the same time, they provide access to pleasures, joy, and experiences otherwise inaccessible had I not made these decisions.\n\nHow then do I choose which pursuit of pleasure is better for me?\n\nI evaluate the pleasures of each against one another.\n\nDrinking and drunkenness made me very social. It brought me friendships, lowered my stress, and allowed me to treat life like a performance. In my drinking days, things just didn’t matter as much. I carried a more laissez-faire approach to life. I was fun, I was spontaneous. I cared more about the adventure and experience than the cost. If your night was looking for a best-supporting actor you called me.\n\nThis came with consequences, which at the time, I didn’t care to acknowledge. I hurt myself, I hurt others, I broke relationships, brought financial anxiety onto myself, damaged my mental health, my physical health, and my emotional health. Drinking prevented me from pursuing the full capacity of my intellectual curiosities and creative desires. Sobriety accelerates me towards them.\n\nIt’s clear that the benefits of sobriety outweigh those of drinking, for me. Being sober, I have less to atone for. But there is a delta here. There are parts of drunk me, missing from sober me, that I really wish transferred over.\n\nThat’s where the deep, silent work of sobriety comes in.\n\nEach day, it’s my responsibility to patch the holes that alcohol-exposed, and work to become the parts of me I love. This includes the good parts unlocked by alcohol. I just need to find a way to step into them, sober.\n\nIf alcohol made me more social, friendly, carefree, and spontaneous, and if I miss those parts of me, then my job is to do the deep work that allows me to step into *that* version of myself without relying on alcohol. The source needs to be inside me, not in a glass.\n\nBut fuck, that work is hard.\n\nIt’s long, exhausting work and sometimes I wish I didn’t have to.\n\nI wish I could just automatically unlock it. With a pill, or a sip.\n\nThat’s when the cravings to drink return. That’s why, after 1,460 days, alcohol is still attractive.\n\nAlcohol presents me with the hack. It offers me the convenience of getting results without doing the work.\n\nBut a compromise here is not worth it.\n\nSobriety is a patient peregrination of self-mastery.\n\nIf I were to succumb to these desires, I’d be allowing alcohol to fulfill its role as a vehicle for escapism.\n\nI’d be depriving myself of the deep, long, inconvenient work of understanding what prevents sober me from becoming the version of myself I aspire to be. Rather than expose every part of myself to the pain of growth, I’d skip the line. Because that is what’s easy.\n\nI consider if maybe the difficulty of the work is actually what’s most important.\n\nIn The Sweet Spot, Paul Bloom writes that “*Hedonists wouldn’t deny that life is full of voluntary suffering. But for the hedonists, these unpleasant acts are the costs that have to be paid to obtain greater benefits. Suffering is the price we pay for greater pleasure.”*\n\nSobriety is voluntary suffering, and each day I grow stronger in it, I’m able to realize the greater pleasures it offers me.\n\nOne of the beauties of sobriety is awareness, feeling everything. In hard times this sucks, pain is amplified and there is no escape. But in joy, it’s arousing. Sobriety may deprive me of some pleasures, but it affords me access to even greater ones.\n\n**_____**\n\nWhen I started writing this piece, I didn’t want to become a drinker again, I just didn’t want to do the work that day. After 4 years I felt I could succeed at a cheat day.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I tried my roommate's CBD gummies with melatonin.\n\nThe first time, I asked them for one. The second night, I asked them for another. On night 3, expecting my ask, they offered me one.\n\nWhat they didn’t know is that earlier that day I went into their bathroom and took 2. Now I had 3. I really liked how fast I fell asleep after eating them. I really liked how deep of a sleep I had after eating them.\n\nThis is misuse. This is addictive behavior.\n\nI really like things that feel good, and these CBD gummies with melatonin made me feel good. What they also did was rob me of the opportunity to do work. Rather than understand why I wasn’t sleeping great, I just took the pill. By taking the gummy, I bypassed the work.\n\nSobriety has taught me that this isn’t sustainable. Taking the pill doesn't solve anything. It just delays. It allows for the roots of poor habits and dependencies to grow.\n\nTo be fair, on the hierarchy of vices, non-psychoactive CBD gummies with melatonin, aren’t bad. This is where compassion comes in and I admire the growth I’ve made. I only share this to offer color as to why just one drink today isn’t for me.\n\nAs my sobriety extends into year 5, I’m proud of my ability to articulate this to myself in real-time. I think it's brave to ask myself if I’ve made the wrong decisions and make my whole self available for upgrades. As uncomfortable and vulnerable growth makes me, I fear stagnation.\n\nThough the temptation to drink is strongest this time of year, it fades quickly. These days, most of my personal development work is focused outside of sobriety. It’s addressing inflexibility, expectations, self-confidence, social anxiety, becoming less judgemental and controlling, the list goes on. The list though would never have been written, had I not stopped drinking.\n\nIn the same way [that first Bud Light at age 14](https://mirror.xyz/rickieticklez.eth/ARNFYIlKYOQpTlTThg9mFDm04cHJfyCX08UoQHgqkXw) opened the door to a 12-year party career, sobriety has been a gateway too. Without sobriety, I would never have found the courage to acknowledge my shortcomings and invest in becoming a better me.\n\nGrowth compounds every day. I may not have every single celebrated part of drunk me in sober me yet, but I’m getting really close.\n\nI’m becoming exactly who I want to be.\n\n\\-\n\n`Every year, I reflect on the previous 365 days of my sobriety with a Soberversary piece. Each Soberversary piece is published as a collectable NFT with a quantity of 26 to celebrate the age at which I chose sobriety. The price of each NFT set in hundredths of 1 ETH, equal to the Soberversary number being reflected on.`", "timestamp": 1658068026, "digest": "wnWcSug0t-Bc6MU1YO6AKdhYrNpsdFGS1_1lsWPNDxo", "contributor": "0xF7bcCC29ae64F761A887eFc486Bcbd2d54209620"}

And, moreover, they refuse to accept the official narrative — suspecting, instead, that Cotten’s “death” looks more like an exit scam.\n\n* This Netflix documentary is the story about an investigation into whether Cotten is, in fact, alive. And whether he took the money and ran. It’s “a dark world, where no one and nothing is what it seems. Will (the investors) be able to unravel the mystery at the heart of Quadriga, find Gerry Cotten, and finally, get their money back?”\n* Gerry Cotten was a man who held money for thousands of people across the world, and his untimely death sparked mass panic as people tried to figure out what the hell happened. Thankfully, there are a number of sleuths already on the case.\n* Alongside business partner Michael Patryn, the pair started working locally before expanding further into the market. In 2014, Cotten claims that money from investors was sent into paper wallets and safe deposit boxes in order to keep it safe. By 2015, they had run into financial difficulties.\n* Cotten took over as the sole director of the company in 2016 ahead of cryptocurrency suddenly having an explosion of popularity in 2017, with an approximate $1 billion going through Quadriga.\n* But this only caused further strain on the largely-unmanned operation of Quadriga, with Cotten not even working from a permanent office space. Later that year, the company lost Ethereum (a decentralized blockchain) in a smart contract error costing them a further $14 million.\n* Bitcoin interest and value tanked throughout 2018, and Quadriga customers started complaining about the slow or unavailable ability to withdraw their cash. $28 million held in Quadriga payment processor Costodian was frozen by The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce that January.\n* In December 2018, Gerry Cotten mysteriously died at the age of 30 during a trip to Jaipur, India. Officially, his death was ruled as a result of complications related to Crohn's Disease, a lifelong condition that affects the bowel and large intestine and causes oftentimes painful inflammation.\n\n## Do you think the Metaver Economy will be worth $13T by 2030?\n\nWell………..\n\nCiti thinks so. A team of analysts at Citi, led by Ronit Ghose, believes that companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:[FB](https://www.investing.com/equities/facebook-inc)) are attacking a $8-$13 billion total addressable market (TAM).\n\n* The total addressable market (TAM) for the metaverse economy could be between $8 trillion and $13 trillion by 2030, with up to five billion users, but getting to that market level is going to require sizable infrastructure investment, Citi said in a report on Thursday.\n* Ghose believes that Metaverse will most likely be based around smartphones with a small portion of all users using virtual reality (VR) devices.\n* For the Metaverse to be adopted widely, the world will need much better internet speeds and higher access to 5G technology. Citi expects only a quarter of the global population to have access to 5G by 2025.\n* The metaverse concept isn't new, the bank’s analysts noted. However, interest in the metaverse really began to snowball at the end of 2021 because of the rise in sales of non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) and big technology companies announcing their interest in the sector.\n* “This ‘open metaverse’ would be community-owned, community-governed and a freely interoperable version that ensures privacy by design,” the report said. Its use cases include commerce, art, media, advertising, healthcare and social collaboration, it added.\n\n![The Metaverse: Is it a Boom or an Upheaval?](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0144af3b-62a1-4130-aea6-3dec5d3c510f_1200x900.png)\n\n## PrimeBlock to go Public via $1.25B SPAC merger\n\nLast friday, Bitcoin mining company PrimeBlock announced a possible merger via Special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) company 10X capital venture acquisition Corp II.

Part 2 Ryoshi\n\n**1.彼时我们假设，消失了整整一年的Ryoshi，带着CAW重新归来。**\n\n而这假设的出发点，除了链上的转账部署以外，还有Ryoshi在Medium上更换了一只鸟的头像，至于是不是乌鸦，仅是猜测：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vnZ2d_xagi5g-EFIo9z1G.png?height=501&width=741)\n\n**2. 在5月29日，距离Ryoshi于2021年5月29日在Medium上最后一篇关于稳定币构想的文章已有一周年。在这天之前，先补充caw创建地址的两个小插曲：**\n\n***4.28，该地址向自己转账并留言：i need the LP later for

are all Ryoshi。**\n\n**与此同时，Ryoshi更换了推特背景图：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wemYjUGHakbjxkv8J0sa2.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\n于是，有热衷于解密的推友发现了**乌鸦星座（Corvus)**。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bakenyamasan/status/1531171794199015424](https://twitter.com/bakenyamasan/status/1531171794199015424)\n\n当然，我们发现的不仅仅是一个疑似乌鸦星座的证据，还有：\n\n***最初的CAW反对者，SHIB社区最大的打脸者，在4月28日于马斯克推特下回复了乌鸦推文，以表忠心：***\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_/status/1519506586271502336](https://twitter.com/shibarium_/status/1519506586271502336)\n\n与此同时，在Ryoshi更换背景的同一天，这个逼把头像换成了满月：\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_](https://twitter.com/shibarium_)\n\n此时，我们注意到，今年的6月15日，是“超级月亮”，而7月15日，也就是池子解锁的日子，正是今年的年度最大满月。\n\n[https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E6%BB%A1%E6%9C%88/59919158](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E6%BB%A1%E6%9C%88/59919158)\n\n###

Part 3 ElonMusk&Vitalik&DogeFounder\n\n在SHIB暴涨的那一年，江湖上就有人疑似挖出了疑似的相关线索。\n\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593](https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593)\n\n**结论：**\n\n1\\.Ryoshi和Vitalik线下是朋友，Vitalik和Musk线下见过面；\n\n2\\.Ryoshi最后一篇文章里，本能地举例过，在一个南非最大港口Durbs卖鱼的例子，而Musk正出身于距离Durbs不远的南非比勒陀利亚；\n\n[https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter](https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter)\n\n**结论：**\n\n3\\.狗币founder与Musk的相爱相杀，疑似其在为马斯克写代码。\n\n### Part 4 神秘推特\n\n### A.MoonKnight\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dark_MoonKnight](https://twitter.com/Dark_MoonKnight)\n\n### B.MoonDame\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_](https://twitter.com/moondame_)\n\n在尽可能追踪和过滤掉关联信息的同时，我们得到了上方疑似项目方对外代表的两个账号。**江湖人称：神秘夫妇。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218](https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218)\n\n我们一下就想到了，Ryoshi在2021年5月29日的最后一篇文章里，他要做稳定币SHI，并在当时已经提出了设想，同时，我们本就也知道，Ryoshi可能不止一个人，而是两个以上在运作。\n\n从其神神叨叨的推文中，我们也得知，不止一个代币，还有：\n\n### (a).$O(Childhood End)|没有推特\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end)\n\n**以及**\n\n### (b).$QOM(Shib的L1）\n\n[https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1](https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1)\n\n当然这两个代币一直未得到社区的认可，直到，\n\nRyoshi的推特更换了月亮背景，Shibarium的推特更换了满月头像以及星星背景：\n\n我们发现，Shibarium的推特背景正是$O的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_](https://twitter.com/shibarium_)\n\nChildhood End意味着童年时代的结束，同时也是SHIB时代的结束。\n\n当然，我们发现的远不止这么多，**请参考Part 5第8条，马斯克推文莎士比亚戏剧The Tempest。**\n\n**除了神秘夫妻，7月以来我们又得到了一个CAW疑似对外的窗口：**\n\n### C.草间，QOM目前的社区管理员，疑似Shib目前的负责人。\n\n在本月Sarah开通推特没几天后，shytoshi，也就是领导shib社区的开发者，目前shib的实际leader，在几分钟之内秒关。\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad)\n\n**7月13日**，明牌告诉你，**老娘是对外窗口：**\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547112545957322752](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547112545957322752)\n\n**在7月14日年度最大满月**，她发布如下推文：\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547500247093575680](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547500247093575680)\n\n除了不拉盘，其他的逼都让她装到位了。\n\n7月17日，头像和背景再度更换成乌鸦相关：\n\n![https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6N59vo1WfE9VJGxOj91Nl.png?height=570&width=737)\n\n### Part 5 马斯克推文\n\n1\\.在4月14日，caw被创建的当天，ElonMusk如下推文，与Logo三朵玫瑰相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473)\n\n2\\.马斯克喜欢特殊数字，与总量666...相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865](https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865)\n\n3\\.5月26日，老马发图，逆时针旋转能得到一个人物，原图和转图同时疑似能找到乌鸦：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366)\n\n4\\.5月28日，老马发图，解放Bird/推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823)\n\n5\\.5月28日，老马发图，图中疑似能找到乌鸦星座：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244)\n\n6\\.5月31日，老马发图，疑似将要推出去中心化推特，颠覆web2:\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921)\n\n7\\.6月4日，老马发图，箭头位置疑似能找到CAW的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712)\n\n8\\.6月6日，老马引用莎士比亚在The Tempest的内容；\n\n除了原戏能找到crow相关外，莎士比亚也曾被人评价为暴发户式的“乌鸦”；\n\n其次，Childhood END的链上总量数字**369369369373**在经过下方链接解码后，最后我们得到了风暴，即“The Tempest”。\n\n再次，\"O“可能不仅仅是Childhood End，也有乌鸦叫声的暗含。\n\n[https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text](https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text)\n\n：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241)\n\n9\\.7月11日左右，疑似Mask账号监控发现其profile做了如下短暂改动：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hjAVHv5ORZw2uoeUdMovO.png?height=682&width=828)\n\n10\\.7月17日，老马嘲讽老逼登：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346)\n\n文案可以看到句子的A，图片文字的Hunter，差一个Dream，于是**热心的币友疑似发现相机的牌子叫做Dream，lol。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T4-z5hhFqnoLBoIQMPtSR.png?height=1280&width=699)\n\n### Part 6 Twitter 前CEO：Jack\n\n**这是另外一条故事线了。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack](https://twitter.com/jack)\n\n在推特前CEO Jack的推特背景，你会看到纯黑的Background，更仔细一点，你就能发现，这个大哥，好像十分钟情于黑色，我们来看一组证明：\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/](https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/)\n\n是不是想到了乌鸦也是黑色，当你把推特的logo颜色更换成纯黑，我们能得到一个暗黑版的推特。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q69u4LI5cnmLR1Kn7EYVC.png?height=673&width=1144)\n\n2019年12月，Jack成立了一个由5个人组成的研发小组，基于区块链开发去中心化社交协议，而这个小组的名称叫Bluesky。\n\n**再仔细一点，Bluesky的头像里你会看到一只乌鸦。**\n\n巧了不是，还有更巧的，我们接着看。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bluesky](https://twitter.com/bluesky)\n\n那一年，Jack发布了一组关于去中心化社交平台的规划：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832)\n\n可以看到，Jack希望这个去中心化推特能有自己的一套标准，能有一个**民间领袖**引领社区（对照社区发现的白皮书）。在这背后，我们并不清楚Jack与Musk此前是否可能开始了接触，但是彼时的他们饱受推特当时的各种问题，至少在境遇上相似。\n\n换句话说，前文我们所谓意淫的马斯克的这套组合拳，是否还有一部分来自于推特前CEO的Jack。在2021年之前的某个时间节点，恰逢两人一拍即合，希望能够打造去中心化推特，解放言论。\n\n2020年，没有英雄，于是他们凭空捏造了一个英雄：Ryoshi，shib当时爆火的背后，可能从来不是被老马翻牌子那么简单。\n\n前文我们提到，Ryoshi可能等于Musk，但是从其谦卑的撰文风格来看，更符合Jack。\n\n同时，他也有在南非的经历。\n\n2019年开始，至今3年的时间即将推出产品，符合开发实际。\n\n而且，从目前的马斯克收购推特来看，营销炒作是实，收购是虚，拖沓战术，剧情的走向也像是在为顺势推出去中心化推特做铺垫，只为迎来某个时间节点。\n\n然后顺着BlueSky这条线索我们找到了其CEO推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea](https://twitter.com/arcalinea)\n\n我们往前翻看推特找到了如下：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017](https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017)\n\n说巧不巧，我们又在最近CAW社区提交的一份**github**中找到了如下：\n\n[https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames](https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames)\n\n**这个魔方图案有点眼熟。**\n\n于是，我们发现，**4月17号**这天，也就是 $CAW 被创建后部署池子的那一天：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594)\n\nJack说巧不巧的发布了一个月球表情，**对应Ryoshi的推特背景，Shibarium的头像，即一轮满月。**\n\n当然，还有：\n\n[https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418)\n\n狗币创始人给了上方回复，一切尽在不言中，而一切，你知我知。\n\n**有了上方的脆弱关联指向：**\n\n于是，我们回到6月11号，**Twitter及Square创始人Jack Dorsey**旗下TBD项目开发负责人**Mike Brock**在Consensus 2022大会上宣布将**建立一个名为“Web 5”的去中心化网络平台。**\n据Mike Brock透露，Web5将为应用程序带来去中心化身份（DID）和数据存储服务，让开发人员专注于创造优质的用户体验，同时将数据和身份的所有权归还给个人。**Web 5的货币层将建立在比特币的基础上，目前仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。**\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/)\n\n还记得在链上数据那一章节，caw的部署地址曾经给自己转账留言，表示**后续会迁移流动性吗**？那时候我们对流动性的迁移一头雾水，现在来看。更像是再为迁移至比特币做冷启动准备。又或者真的是QOM的L1，鬼知道呢？\n\n###

Dream\n\n今年，也就是2022年，《艾尔登法环》成为最大的爆款游戏，Steam的在线人数已经达到了86万的峰值，当然，这86万个冤大头，哥也去凑了数。\n\n老头环的玩家都知道，其开发公司**FromSoftware**还有一部作品叫**BloodBorne（血源：诅咒）**，这个系列为**马斯克**所热衷，据说是因为他前女友爱玩。\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1546598042844991489](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1546598042844991489)\n\n当然，我并不想跟你聊游戏，但又不得不聊到游戏。\n\n《血源》的背景设定在位于遥远东方、外人罕至的山区古都“亚楠”。亚楠封闭排外，但据传亚楠拥有可以治疗外界不治之症的名为“血疗”的神秘医疗技术，许多饱受疾病痛苦的病患长途跋涉来到亚楠以寻求“血疗”治愈。然而，受难以名状存在的伟力影响，一种名为“兽化病”的瘟疫在亚楠蔓延，亚楠的人们不可避免地异变为丧失心智的狂暴野兽。\n\n兽化病使得专门以狩猎怪兽为生的“猎人”诞生，他们的使命就是进入梦境，杀死（解脱）那些不幸兽化的人们。（摘自[百度百科](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%A1%80%E6%BA%90%E8%AF%85%E5%92%92/16985035?fr=aladdin)）\n\n在日语中，**Hunter的名字是Ryoshi。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8w6dDDsDzqhLogVx0CMUi.png?height=252&width=1580)\n\n我们得知， A Hunter’s Dream=Ryoshi’s Dream，代币简称CAW。\n\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0xf3b9569f82b18aef890de263b84189bd33ebe452](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf3b9569f82b18aef890de263b84189bd33ebe452)\n\n### 鸟嘴面具\n\n> 八百年前的德国小城鼠患成灾\n>\n> 全城人束手无策打算弃城逃走\n>\n> 斑衣吹笛人突然出现在市长面前\n>\n> 他服装的花色古怪腰上插着笛子\n>\n> —— 格林童话《哈梅尔的吹笛人》\n\n鼠疫（黑死病），在中世纪曾使欧洲减员三分之一人口，在某些地区，这个减员率甚至超过了60%，黑死病扫过之处寸草不生，欧洲人的平均寿命下降了二十岁。\n\n为了降低受传染的几率，16世纪的法国医生Charles de Lorme（1584\\\\\\~1678），路易十三的御医发明了防传染医生套装，它长这样：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fCAb03MaPku_UxFU8skDO.png?height=600&width=292)\n\n在《血源：诅咒》**中，能够找到几个世纪前类似于黑死病的缩影，同样，也能找到同一个如上图所示的**鸟嘴形状面具。在那个死亡阴影笼罩下的中世纪欧洲，鸟嘴面具就是穿梭于黑暗中的\"幽灵\"，人们畏惧着它的到来，却又渴望得到它的救赎，邪恶与圣洁，都只在一念之间。\n\n那时，戴上鸟嘴面具的医生是神的代表。\n\n现在，戴上鸟嘴面具的CAW又在侍奉哪位真主？\n\n###

Part 2 Ryoshi\n\n**1.彼时我们假设，消失了整整一年的Ryoshi，带着CAW重新归来。**\n\n而这假设的出发点，除了链上的转账部署以外，还有Ryoshi在Medium上更换了一只鸟的头像，至于是不是乌鸦，仅是猜测：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vnZ2d_xagi5g-EFIo9z1G.png?height=501&width=741)\n\n**2. 在5月29日，距离Ryoshi于2021年5月29日在Medium上最后一篇关于稳定币构想的文章已有一周年。在这天之前，先补充caw创建地址的两个小插曲：**\n\n***4.28，该地址向自己转账并留言：i need the LP later for

are all Ryoshi。**\n\n**与此同时，Ryoshi更换了推特背景图：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wemYjUGHakbjxkv8J0sa2.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\n于是，有热衷于解密的推友发现了**乌鸦星座（Corvus)**。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bakenyamasan/status/1531171794199015424](https://twitter.com/bakenyamasan/status/1531171794199015424)\n\n当然，我们发现的不仅仅是一个疑似乌鸦星座的证据，还有：\n\n***最初的CAW反对者，SHIB社区最大的打脸者，在4月28日于马斯克推特下回复了乌鸦推文，以表忠心：***\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_/status/1519506586271502336](https://twitter.com/shibarium_/status/1519506586271502336)\n\n与此同时，在Ryoshi更换背景的同一天，这个逼把头像换成了满月：\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_](https://twitter.com/shibarium_)\n\n此时，我们注意到，今年的6月15日，是“超级月亮”，而7月15日，也就是池子解锁的日子，正是今年的年度最大满月。\n\n[https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E6%BB%A1%E6%9C%88/59919158](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E6%BB%A1%E6%9C%88/59919158)\n\n### 4.池子解锁-7月17日\n\n7月17日早上8点池子解锁。\n\n除此以外，项目方又给池子加了80wu的流动性。\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x87268eb2568fdc4be19396ce1c50a6712ca8cfb8abee880b8d3b767e07ca907d](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x87268eb2568fdc4be19396ce1c50a6712ca8cfb8abee880b8d3b767e07ca907d)\n\n部署地址再度给自己转账0.999eth，并**留言“zrUfKaKV”。**\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcae4b15350b3ccc2b37fec5caa718560241ec181bc49741d5d1199d1d32412d4](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcae4b15350b3ccc2b37fec5caa718560241ec181bc49741d5d1199d1d32412d4)\n\n### Part 3 ElonMusk&Vitalik&DogeFounder\n\n在SHIB暴涨的那一年，江湖上就有人疑似挖出了疑似的相关线索。\n\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593](https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593)\n\n**结论：**\n\n1\\.Ryoshi和Vitalik线下是朋友，Vitalik和Musk线下见过面；\n\n2\\.Ryoshi最后一篇文章里，本能地举例过，在一个南非最大港口Durbs卖鱼的例子，而Musk正出身于距离Durbs不远的南非比勒陀利亚；\n\n[https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter](https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter)\n\n**结论：**\n\n3\\.狗币founder与Musk的相爱相杀，疑似其在为马斯克写代码。\n\n### Part 4 神秘推特\n\n### A.MoonKnight\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dark_MoonKnight](https://twitter.com/Dark_MoonKnight)\n\n### B.MoonDame\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_](https://twitter.com/moondame_)\n\n在尽可能追踪和过滤掉关联信息的同时，我们得到了上方疑似项目方对外代表的两个账号。**江湖人称：神秘夫妇。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218](https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218)\n\n我们一下就想到了，Ryoshi在2021年5月29日的最后一篇文章里，他要做稳定币SHI，并在当时已经提出了设想，同时，我们本就也知道，Ryoshi可能不止一个人，而是两个以上在运作。\n\n从其神神叨叨的推文中，我们也得知，不止一个代币，还有：\n\n### (a).$O(Childhood End)|没有推特\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end)\n\n**以及**\n\n### (b).$QOM(Shib的L1）\n\n[https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1](https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1)\n\n当然这两个代币一直未得到社区的认可，直到，\n\nRyoshi的推特更换了月亮背景，Shibarium的推特更换了满月头像以及星星背景：\n\n我们发现，Shibarium的推特背景正是$O的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_](https://twitter.com/shibarium_)\n\nChildhood End意味着童年时代的结束，同时也是SHIB时代的结束。\n\n当然，我们发现的远不止这么多，**请参考Part 5第8条，马斯克推文莎士比亚戏剧The Tempest。**\n\n**除了神秘夫妻，7月以来我们又得到了一个CAW疑似对外的窗口：**\n\n### C.草间，QOM目前的社区管理员，疑似Shib目前的负责人。\n\n在本月Sarah开通推特没几天后，shytoshi，也就是领导shib社区的开发者，目前shib的实际leader，在几分钟之内秒关。\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad)\n\n**7月13日**，明牌告诉你，**老娘是对外窗口：**\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547112545957322752](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547112545957322752)\n\n**在7月14日年度最大满月**，她发布如下推文：\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547500247093575680](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547500247093575680)\n\n除了不拉盘，其他的逼都让她装到位了。\n\n7月17日，头像和背景再度更换成乌鸦相关：\n\n![https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6N59vo1WfE9VJGxOj91Nl.png?height=570&width=737)\n\n### Part 5 马斯克推文\n\n1\\.在4月14日，caw被创建的当天，ElonMusk如下推文，与Logo三朵玫瑰相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473)\n\n2\\.马斯克喜欢特殊数字，与总量666...相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865](https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865)\n\n3\\.5月26日，老马发图，逆时针旋转能得到一个人物，原图和转图同时疑似能找到乌鸦：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366)\n\n4\\.5月28日，老马发图，解放Bird/推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823)\n\n5\\.5月28日，老马发图，图中疑似能找到乌鸦星座：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244)\n\n6\\.5月31日，老马发图，疑似将要推出去中心化推特，颠覆web2:\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921)\n\n7\\.6月4日，老马发图，箭头位置疑似能找到CAW的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712)\n\n8\\.6月6日，老马引用莎士比亚在The Tempest的内容；\n\n除了原戏能找到crow相关外，莎士比亚也曾被人评价为暴发户式的“乌鸦”；\n\n其次，Childhood END的链上总量数字**369369369373**在经过下方链接解码后，最后我们得到了风暴，即“The Tempest”。\n\n再次，\"O“可能不仅仅是Childhood End，也有乌鸦叫声的暗含。\n\n[https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text](https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text)\n\n：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241)\n\n9\\.7月11日左右，疑似Mask账号监控发现其profile做了如下短暂改动：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hjAVHv5ORZw2uoeUdMovO.png?height=682&width=828)\n\n10\\.7月17日，老马嘲讽老逼登：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346)\n\n文案可以看到句子的A，图片文字的Hunter，差一个Dream，于是**热心的币友疑似发现相机的牌子叫做Dream，lol。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T4-z5hhFqnoLBoIQMPtSR.png?height=1280&width=699)\n\n### Part 6 Twitter 前CEO：Jack\n\n**这是另外一条故事线了。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack](https://twitter.com/jack)\n\n在推特前CEO Jack的推特背景，你会看到纯黑的Background，更仔细一点，你就能发现，这个大哥，好像十分钟情于黑色，我们来看一组证明：\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/](https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/)\n\n是不是想到了乌鸦也是黑色，当你把推特的logo颜色更换成纯黑，我们能得到一个暗黑版的推特。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q69u4LI5cnmLR1Kn7EYVC.png?height=673&width=1144)\n\n2019年12月，Jack成立了一个由5个人组成的研发小组，基于区块链开发去中心化社交协议，而这个小组的名称叫Bluesky。\n\n**再仔细一点，Bluesky的头像里你会看到一只乌鸦。**\n\n巧了不是，还有更巧的，我们接着看。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bluesky](https://twitter.com/bluesky)\n\n那一年，Jack发布了一组关于去中心化社交平台的规划：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832)\n\n可以看到，Jack希望这个去中心化推特能有自己的一套标准，能有一个**民间领袖**引领社区（对照社区发现的白皮书）。在这背后，我们并不清楚Jack与Musk此前是否可能开始了接触，但是彼时的他们饱受推特当时的各种问题，至少在境遇上相似。\n\n换句话说，前文我们所谓意淫的马斯克的这套组合拳，是否还有一部分来自于推特前CEO的Jack。在2021年之前的某个时间节点，恰逢两人一拍即合，希望能够打造去中心化推特，解放言论。\n\n2020年，没有英雄，于是他们凭空捏造了一个英雄：Ryoshi，shib当时爆火的背后，可能从来不是被老马翻牌子那么简单。\n\n前文我们提到，Ryoshi可能等于Musk，但是从其谦卑的撰文风格来看，更符合Jack。\n\n同时，他也有在南非的经历。\n\n2019年开始，至今3年的时间即将推出产品，符合开发实际。\n\n而且，从目前的马斯克收购推特来看，营销炒作是实，收购是虚，拖沓战术，剧情的走向也像是在为顺势推出去中心化推特做铺垫，只为迎来某个时间节点。\n\n然后顺着BlueSky这条线索我们找到了其CEO推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea](https://twitter.com/arcalinea)\n\n我们往前翻看推特找到了如下：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017](https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017)\n\n说巧不巧，我们又在最近CAW社区提交的一份**github**中找到了如下：\n\n[https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames](https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames)\n\n**这个魔方图案有点眼熟。**\n\n于是，我们发现，**4月17号**这天，也就是 $CAW

The company said that you need not have a crypto wallet to buy them, so your credit or debit card should be enough, and you can use Reddit’s own wallet product to store them. What’s more, you can mix and match your avatar’s look with merch available in [the avatar builder](https://www.reddit.com/avatar), and the avatar will have a “glow-like effect” next to your comments in communities. The limited-edition NFT avatars come with licensing rights although not as extensive as the Bored Apes license. They are partnering with Polygon to mint the NFTs. The NFTs are currently only available to members of the r/CollectibleAvatars subreddit (invite only), but Reddit is planning to roll them out to the public in the coming weeks. Listing prices for these NFT avatars are $9.99, $24.99, $49.99, $74.99 or $99.99.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72442b48-c255-42a5-aa84-caf782cd5958\\_1200x800.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72442b48-c255-42a5-aa84-caf782cd5958\\_1200x800.jpeg)\n\n## How Axie Infinity got hacked for $600m 🤯🤯🤯\n\nSometime in April, [we reported](https://fomofix.substack.com/i/51484827/p2e-game-axie-infinity-hack) on how the P2E crypto game Axie Infinity got exploited for 170k ETH and 25 million USDC through its sidechain Ronin. Well, there’s more news on how the exploit happened. TL;DR: Lazarus, a hacker group associated with North Korea, is thought to be behind the hack.\n\nA [report from The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/156038/how-a-fake-job-offer-took-down-the-worlds-most-popular-crypto-game) on Wednesday revealed that the hack was socially engineered via a fake job offer. A senior Sky Mavis engineer was targeted by \"recruiters\" on LinkedIn who hoped to sign him to their company, reports The Block, citing sources familiar with the matter. The recruiting process involved several interviews and ended with a job offer, sent via PDF. The company, however, didn't exist, and the PDF was laced with spyware. \n\nRonin is a Proof-of-Authority blockchain, which means control over the network is given to hand-picked validators. At the time of the hack, Axie Infinity had nine validators. For a bad actor to take control of Ronin, they needed to take control of five of those nine validators. For a bad actor to take complete control of the bitcoin blockchain, which uses Proof-of-Work, they would need 51% of the electricity being utilized by every bitcoin miner in the world. While bitcoin is designed to be secure at all costs, Ronin's sole purpose was to provide cheap, quick transactions for Axie Infinity players. In an April [post-mortem](https://roninblockchain.substack.com/p/back-to-building-ronin-security-breach), the Axie team wrote: \"Sky Mavis employees are under constant advanced spear-phishing attacks on various social channels and one employee was compromised. This employee no longer works at Sky Mavis. The attacker managed to leverage that access to penetrate Sky Mavis IT infrastructure and gain access to the validator nodes.\"\n\nSince the hack, Sky Mavis has attempted to make amends with Axie Players. Following a $150 million funding round in April, Sky Mavis is reimbursing players who lost crypto in the hack. To boost up security, Ronin now has 11 validators rather than nine\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef2b32a-065c-46b5-9f95-394be816a8f7\\_1024x614.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef2b32a-065c-46b5-9f95-394be816a8f7\\_1024x614.webp)\n\n[Share](https://fomofix.substack.com/p/a-new-crypto-phone-reddit-nfts-a?utm_source=substack\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_content=share\\&action=share)\n\n## $EUROC: A new stablecoin from Circle\n\nEUROC is a stablecoin issued by circle (the same issuers of USDC). Euro Coin (EUROC) is issued by Circle under the same full-reserve model as [USD Coin (USDC)](http://circle.com/usdc), a trusted dollar digital currency with more than $55 billion in circulation. Designed for stability, Euro Coin is 100% backed by euros held in euro-denominated banking accounts so that it’s always redeemable 1:1 for euros. - From the Circle website.\n\nEUROC is currently only available in the US because of the negative interest rates that have plagued Europe for a long time together with the recent collapse of UST caused the EU to recently pass a bill where stablecoins would be subject to operation restrictions - including a cap of 200m Euros in transactions per day. \n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ebe5e9e-e187-4862-9557-c63cef196373\\_1024x524.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ebe5e9e-e187-4862-9557-c63cef196373\\_1024x524.png)\n\nEUROC stablecoin gives businesses wider access to euro liquidity, which can be used for payments, trading, lending and borrowing. The stablecoin will initially launch on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 standard token.\n\nIn terms of foreign exchange turnover, the euro is the second largest fiat currency in the world, according to the Bank for International Settlement (BIS). The BIS’ 2019 Triennial Central Bank Survey [found](https://www.bis.org/statistics/rpfx19\\_fx.htm) that the euro was on one side of 32% of all currency trades.\n\n## Voyager files for chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nVoyager Digital, a crypto lender that had over $1.5b in crypto assets, has just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The bankruptcy filing announced Wednesday came just days after Voyager suspended trading, deposits, withdrawals, and loyalty rewards for its customers, and on the heels of the crash of Three Arrows Capital. Last month, Voyager issued a notice of default to the crypto-focused hedge fund for failing to make the required payments on a loan worth more than $650 million; Three Arrows Capital has since collapsed into liquidation, leaving Voyager scrambling to collect what is owed. Voyager chief executive Stephen Ehrlich said in a tweet Wednesday:\n\nUnder Voyager’s proposed bankruptcy plan, customers who had cryptocurrencies in their accounts would receive a combination of crypto, proceeds from the funds recovered from Three Arrows, shares in the newly reorganized company, and Voyager tokens, the company said. Customers with cash deposits in their accounts would receive access to those funds after the company and Metropolitan Commercial Bank completed a reconciliation and fraud prevention process, Voyager said.\n\n## Interesting Reads\n\n*   [Benefits of Launching a New Token in a Bear Market.](https://blog.coinlist.co/benefits-of-launching-a-new-token-in-a-bear-market/)\n*   [State of ETH Q2 2022.](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/state-of-ethereum-report-q2-2022)\n*   [Framework for evaluating L1s.](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/a-framework-for-evaluating-layer)\n*   [Mapping out the stablecoin ecosystem.](https://twitter.com/TheBlockRes/status/1544684234849210370)\n*   [Introducing Web5.](https://twitter.com/TheBlockRes/status/1544321970627543042)\n*   [Anatomy of a high yield credit freeze.](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1544294016346357762)\n*   [On continuous token models.](https://mirror.xyz/jubrlee.eth/PpJ70T9hCOxjo3UVbIbTjvzoDjGyDbo7WxQUh4cCz6c)\n\n## Recent Fund Raises\n\n*   [Konvoy Ventures 150m gaming fund.](https://twitter.com/TheBlock\\_\\_/status/1545073119018336261)\n\n*   [TON Foundation 90m ecosystem round.](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1545061097018773504)\n\n*   [Ondo raises 10m in Public Sale.](https://twitter.com/TheBlock\\_\\_/status/1544818936625205248)\n\n*   [Planetarium Labs raises 32m.](https://twitter.com/TheBlock\\_\\_/status/1544833971795529729)\n\n*   [Tenderise raises 3m.](https://twitter.com/TheBlock\\_\\_/status/1545030267156439041)\n\n*   [H2O Securities](https://u23463625.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/1XYvdFCJJ2pGeJkFwvFQVDGJ0yP0cLeMwVwv1ISTyiz0gUQ8TMO-QIENKJgVtvPf/3nk/ONb5s_ZvR8Os3XopS-SUpQ/h47/nbaV7Grq2Amz-c4\\_BHLP7uGC9XErc3dJRjP2EzCbvpk) raises $150M to tokenize water financing with their H2ON token.\n\n    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a642df6-afa7-4fd8-8857-1dee296f3027\\_480x360.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a642df6-afa7-4fd8-8857-1dee296f3027\\_480x360.gif)\n\n    ***DISCLAIMER: ***\n\n    *None of this is financial advice.

ElonMusk&Vitalik&DogeFounder\n\n在SHIB暴涨的那一年，江湖上就有人疑似挖出了疑似的相关线索。\n\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593](https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593)\n\n**结论：**\n\n1\\.Ryoshi和Vitalik线下是朋友，Vitalik和Musk线下见过面；\n\n2\\.Ryoshi最后一篇文章里，本能地举例过，在一个南非最大港口Durbs卖鱼的例子，而Musk正出身于距离Durbs不远的南非比勒陀利亚；\n\n[https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter](https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter)\n\n**结论：**\n\n3\\.狗币founder与Musk的相爱相杀，疑似其在为马斯克写代码。\n\n###

B.MoonDame\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_](https://twitter.com/moondame_)\n\n在尽可能追踪和过滤掉关联信息的同时，我们得到了上方疑似项目方对外代表的两个账号。**江湖人称：神秘夫妇。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218](https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218)\n\n我们一下就想到了，Ryoshi在2021年5月29日的最后一篇文章里，他要做稳定币SHI，并在当时已经提出了设想，同时，我们本就也知道，Ryoshi可能不止一个人，而是两个以上在运作。\n\n从其神神叨叨的推文中，我们也得知，不止一个代币，还有：\n\n### (a).$O(Childhood End)|没有推特\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end)\n\n**以及**\n\n###

End意味着童年时代的结束，同时也是SHIB时代的结束。\n\n当然，我们发现的远不止这么多，**请参考Part 5第8条，马斯克推文莎士比亚戏剧The Tempest。**\n\n**除了神秘夫妻，7月以来我们又得到了一个CAW疑似对外的窗口：**\n\n###

马斯克推文\n\n1\\.在4月14日，caw被创建的当天，ElonMusk如下推文，与Logo三朵玫瑰相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473)\n\n2\\.马斯克喜欢特殊数字，与总量666...相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865](https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865)\n\n3\\.5月26日，老马发图，逆时针旋转能得到一个人物，原图和转图同时疑似能找到乌鸦：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366)\n\n4\\.5月28日，老马发图，解放Bird/推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823)\n\n5\\.5月28日，老马发图，图中疑似能找到乌鸦星座：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244)\n\n6\\.5月31日，老马发图，疑似将要推出去中心化推特，颠覆web2:\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921)\n\n7\\.6月4日，老马发图，箭头位置疑似能找到CAW的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712)\n\n8\\.6月6日，老马引用莎士比亚在The

End，也有乌鸦叫声的暗含。\n\n[https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text](https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text)\n\n：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241)\n\n9\\.7月11日左右，疑似Mask账号监控发现其profile做了如下短暂改动：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hjAVHv5ORZw2uoeUdMovO.png?height=682&width=828)\n\n10\\.7月17日，老马嘲讽老逼登：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346)\n\n文案可以看到句子的A，图片文字的Hunter，差一个Dream，于是**热心的币友疑似发现相机的牌子叫做Dream，lol。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T4-z5hhFqnoLBoIQMPtSR.png?height=1280&width=699)\n\n### Part 6 Twitter 前CEO：Jack\n\n**这是另外一条故事线了。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack](https://twitter.com/jack)\n\n在推特前CEO Jack的推特背景，你会看到纯黑的Background，更仔细一点，你就能发现，这个大哥，好像十分钟情于黑色，我们来看一组证明：\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/](https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/)\n\n是不是想到了乌鸦也是黑色，当你把推特的logo颜色更换成纯黑，我们能得到一个暗黑版的推特。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q69u4LI5cnmLR1Kn7EYVC.png?height=673&width=1144)\n\n2019年12月，Jack成立了一个由5个人组成的研发小组，基于区块链开发去中心化社交协议，而这个小组的名称叫Bluesky。\n\n**再仔细一点，Bluesky的头像里你会看到一只乌鸦。**\n\n巧了不是，还有更巧的，我们接着看。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bluesky](https://twitter.com/bluesky)\n\n那一年，Jack发布了一组关于去中心化社交平台的规划：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832)\n\n可以看到，Jack希望这个去中心化推特能有自己的一套标准，能有一个**民间领袖**引领社区（对照社区发现的白皮书）。在这背后，我们并不清楚Jack与Musk此前是否可能开始了接触，但是彼时的他们饱受推特当时的各种问题，至少在境遇上相似。\n\n换句话说，前文我们所谓意淫的马斯克的这套组合拳，是否还有一部分来自于推特前CEO的Jack。在2021年之前的某个时间节点，恰逢两人一拍即合，希望能够打造去中心化推特，解放言论。\n\n2020年，没有英雄，于是他们凭空捏造了一个英雄：Ryoshi，shib当时爆火的背后，可能从来不是被老马翻牌子那么简单。\n\n前文我们提到，Ryoshi可能等于Musk，但是从其谦卑的撰文风格来看，更符合Jack。\n\n同时，他也有在南非的经历。\n\n2019年开始，至今3年的时间即将推出产品，符合开发实际。\n\n而且，从目前的马斯克收购推特来看，营销炒作是实，收购是虚，拖沓战术，剧情的走向也像是在为顺势推出去中心化推特做铺垫，只为迎来某个时间节点。\n\n然后顺着BlueSky这条线索我们找到了其CEO推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea](https://twitter.com/arcalinea)\n\n我们往前翻看推特找到了如下：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017](https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017)\n\n说巧不巧，我们又在最近CAW社区提交的一份**github**中找到了如下：\n\n[https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames](https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames)\n\n**这个魔方图案有点眼熟。**\n\n于是，我们发现，**4月17号**这天，也就是 $CAW 被创建后部署池子的那一天：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594)\n\nJack说巧不巧的发布了一个月球表情，**对应Ryoshi的推特背景，Shibarium的头像，即一轮满月。**\n\n当然，还有：\n\n[https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418)\n\n狗币创始人给了上方回复，一切尽在不言中，而一切，你知我知。\n\n**有了上方的脆弱关联指向：**\n\n于是，我们回到6月11号，**Twitter及Square创始人Jack Dorsey**旗下TBD项目开发负责人**Mike Brock**在Consensus 2022大会上宣布将**建立一个名为“Web 5”的去中心化网络平台。**\n据Mike Brock透露，Web5将为应用程序带来去中心化身份（DID）和数据存储服务，让开发人员专注于创造优质的用户体验，同时将数据和身份的所有权归还给个人。**Web 5的货币层将建立在比特币的基础上，目前仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。**\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/)\n\n还记得在链上数据那一章节，caw的部署地址曾经给自己转账留言，表示**后续会迁移流动性吗**？那时候我们对流动性的迁移一头雾水，现在来看。更像是再为迁移至比特币做冷启动准备。又或者真的是QOM的L1，鬼知道呢？\n\n###

Part 2 Ryoshi\n\n**1.彼时我们假设，消失了整整一年的Ryoshi，带着CAW重新归来。**\n\n而这假设的出发点，除了链上的转账部署以外，还有Ryoshi在Medium上更换了一只鸟的头像，至于是不是乌鸦，仅是猜测：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vnZ2d_xagi5g-EFIo9z1G.png?height=501&width=741)\n\n**2. 在5月29日，距离Ryoshi于2021年5月29日在Medium上最后一篇关于稳定币构想的文章已有一周年。在这天之前，先补充caw创建地址的两个小插曲：**\n\n***4.28，该地址向自己转账并留言：i need the LP later for

are all Ryoshi。**\n\n**与此同时，Ryoshi更换了推特背景图：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wemYjUGHakbjxkv8J0sa2.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\n于是，有热衷于解密的推友发现了**乌鸦星座（Corvus)**。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bakenyamasan/status/1531171794199015424](https://twitter.com/bakenyamasan/status/1531171794199015424)\n\n当然，我们发现的不仅仅是一个疑似乌鸦星座的证据，还有：\n\n***最初的CAW反对者，SHIB社区最大的打脸者，在4月28日于马斯克推特下回复了乌鸦推文，以表忠心：***\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_/status/1519506586271502336](https://twitter.com/shibarium_/status/1519506586271502336)\n\n与此同时，在Ryoshi更换背景的同一天，这个逼把头像换成了满月：\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_](https://twitter.com/shibarium_)\n\n此时，我们注意到，今年的6月15日，是“超级月亮”，而7月15日，也就是池子解锁的日子，正是今年的年度最大满月。\n\n[https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E6%BB%A1%E6%9C%88/59919158](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E6%BB%A1%E6%9C%88/59919158)\n\n**4.池子解锁-7月17日**\n\n7月17日早上8点池子解锁。\n\n除此以外，项目方又给池子加了80wu的流动性。\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x87268eb2568fdc4be19396ce1c50a6712ca8cfb8abee880b8d3b767e07ca907d](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x87268eb2568fdc4be19396ce1c50a6712ca8cfb8abee880b8d3b767e07ca907d)\n\n部署地址再度给自己转账0.999eth，并**留言“zrUfKaKV”。**\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcae4b15350b3ccc2b37fec5caa718560241ec181bc49741d5d1199d1d32412d4](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcae4b15350b3ccc2b37fec5caa718560241ec181bc49741d5d1199d1d32412d4)\n\n### Part 3 ElonMusk&Vitalik&DogeFounder\n\n在SHIB暴涨的那一年，江湖上就有人疑似挖出了疑似的相关线索。\n\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593](https://medium.com/coinmonks/who-is-the-founder-of-shiba-inu-ryoshi-c8a9f0b95593)\n\n**结论：**\n\n1\\.Ryoshi和Vitalik线下是朋友，Vitalik和Musk线下见过面；\n\n2\\.Ryoshi最后一篇文章里，本能地举例过，在一个南非最大港口Durbs卖鱼的例子，而Musk正出身于距离Durbs不远的南非比勒陀利亚；\n\n[https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter](https://u.today/elon-musk-hits-back-at-dogecoin-co-founder-who-called-him-self-absorbed-grifter)\n\n**结论：**\n\n3\\.狗币founder与Musk的相爱相杀，疑似其在为马斯克写代码。\n\n### Part 4 神秘推特\n\n### A.MoonKnight\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dark_MoonKnight](https://twitter.com/Dark_MoonKnight)\n\n### B.MoonDame\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_](https://twitter.com/moondame_)\n\n在尽可能追踪和过滤掉关联信息的同时，我们得到了上方疑似项目方对外代表的两个账号。**江湖人称：神秘夫妇。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218](https://twitter.com/moondame_/status/1532477250842505218)\n\n我们一下就想到了，Ryoshi在2021年5月29日的最后一篇文章里，他要做稳定币SHI，并在当时已经提出了设想，同时，我们本就也知道，Ryoshi可能不止一个人，而是两个以上在运作。\n\n从其神神叨叨的推文中，我们也得知，不止一个代币，还有：\n\n### (a).$O(Childhood End)|没有推特\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/childhoods-end)\n\n**以及**\n\n### (b).$QOM(Shib的L1）\n\n[https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1](https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1)\n\n当然这两个代币一直未得到社区的认可，直到，\n\nRyoshi的推特更换了月亮背景，Shibarium的推特更换了满月头像以及星星背景：\n\n我们发现，Shibarium的推特背景正是$O的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/shibarium_](https://twitter.com/shibarium_)\n\nChildhood End意味着童年时代的结束，同时也是SHIB时代的结束。\n\n当然，我们发现的远不止这么多，**请参考Part 5第8条，马斯克推文莎士比亚戏剧The Tempest。**\n\n**除了神秘夫妻，7月以来我们又得到了一个CAW疑似对外的窗口：**\n\n### C.草间，QOM目前的社区管理员，疑似Shib目前的负责人。\n\n在本月Sarah开通推特没几天后，shytoshi，也就是领导shib社区的开发者，目前shib的实际leader，在几分钟之内秒关。\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad)\n\n**7月13日**，明牌告诉你，**老娘是对外窗口：**\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547112545957322752](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547112545957322752)\n\n**在7月14日年度最大满月**，她发布如下推文：\n\n[https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547500247093575680](https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad/status/1547500247093575680)\n\n除了不拉盘，其他的逼都让她装到位了。\n\n7月17日，头像和背景再度更换成乌鸦相关：\n\n![https://twitter.com/ItsSaraRaad](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6N59vo1WfE9VJGxOj91Nl.png?height=570&width=737)\n\n### Part 5 马斯克推文\n\n1\\.在4月14日，caw被创建的当天，ElonMusk如下推文，与Logo三朵玫瑰相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514720245113577473)\n\n2\\.马斯克喜欢特殊数字，与总量666...相对应：\n\n[https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865](https://twitter.com/mooneymaking/status/1519959025433124865)\n\n3\\.5月26日，老马发图，逆时针旋转能得到一个人物，原图和转图同时疑似能找到乌鸦：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529545102447759366)\n\n4\\.5月28日，老马发图，解放Bird/推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530380264966434823)\n\n5\\.5月28日，老马发图，图中疑似能找到乌鸦星座：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1530516552084234244)\n\n6\\.5月31日，老马发图，疑似将要推出去中心化推特，颠覆web2:\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531647849599057921)\n\n7\\.6月4日，老马发图，箭头位置疑似能找到CAW的logo：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532933207276019712)\n\n8\\.6月6日，老马引用莎士比亚在The Tempest的内容；\n\n除了原戏能找到crow相关外，莎士比亚也曾被人评价为暴发户式的“乌鸦”；\n\n其次，Childhood END的链上总量数字**369369369373**在经过下方链接解码后，最后我们得到了风暴，即“The Tempest”。\n\n再次，\"O“可能不仅仅是Childhood End，也有乌鸦叫声的暗含。\n\n[https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text](https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-decimal-to-text)\n\n：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533603431373578241)\n\n9\\.7月11日左右，疑似Mask账号监控发现其profile做了如下短暂改动：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hjAVHv5ORZw2uoeUdMovO.png?height=682&width=828)\n\n10\\.7月17日，老马嘲讽老逼登：\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1547238325907513346)\n\n文案可以看到句子的A，图片文字的Hunter，差一个Dream，于是**热心的币友疑似发现相机的牌子叫做Dream，lol。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T4-z5hhFqnoLBoIQMPtSR.png?height=1280&width=699)\n\n### Part 6 Twitter 前CEO：Jack\n\n**这是另外一条故事线了。**\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack](https://twitter.com/jack)\n\n在推特前CEO Jack的推特背景，你会看到纯黑的Background，更仔细一点，你就能发现，这个大哥，好像十分钟情于黑色，我们来看一组证明：\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/](https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-wont-get-edit-tweet-button/)\n\n是不是想到了乌鸦也是黑色，当你把推特的logo颜色更换成纯黑，我们能得到一个暗黑版的推特。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q69u4LI5cnmLR1Kn7EYVC.png?height=673&width=1144)\n\n2019年12月，Jack成立了一个由5个人组成的研发小组，基于区块链开发去中心化社交协议，而这个小组的名称叫Bluesky。\n\n**再仔细一点，Bluesky的头像里你会看到一只乌鸦。**\n\n巧了不是，还有更巧的，我们接着看。\n\n[https://twitter.com/bluesky](https://twitter.com/bluesky)\n\n那一年，Jack发布了一组关于去中心化社交平台的规划：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766093740408832)\n\n可以看到，Jack希望这个去中心化推特能有自己的一套标准，能有一个**民间领袖**引领社区（对照社区发现的白皮书）。在这背后，我们并不清楚Jack与Musk此前是否可能开始了接触，但是彼时的他们饱受推特当时的各种问题，至少在境遇上相似。\n\n换句话说，前文我们所谓意淫的马斯克的这套组合拳，是否还有一部分来自于推特前CEO的Jack。在2021年之前的某个时间节点，恰逢两人一拍即合，希望能够打造去中心化推特，解放言论。\n\n2020年，没有英雄，于是他们凭空捏造了一个英雄：Ryoshi，shib当时爆火的背后，可能从来不是被老马翻牌子那么简单。\n\n前文我们提到，Ryoshi可能等于Musk，但是从其谦卑的撰文风格来看，更符合Jack。\n\n同时，他也有在南非的经历。\n\n2019年开始，至今3年的时间即将推出产品，符合开发实际。\n\n而且，从目前的马斯克收购推特来看，营销炒作是实，收购是虚，拖沓战术，剧情的走向也像是在为顺势推出去中心化推特做铺垫，只为迎来某个时间节点。\n\n然后顺着BlueSky这条线索我们找到了其CEO推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea](https://twitter.com/arcalinea)\n\n我们往前翻看推特找到了如下：\n\n[https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017](https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1515133344316502017)\n\n说巧不巧，我们又在最近CAW社区提交的一份**github**中找到了如下：\n\n[https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames](https://github.com/MasterSprouts/CawUsernames)\n\n**这个魔方图案有点眼熟。**\n\n于是，我们发现，**4月17号**这天，也就是 $CAW 被创建后部署池子的那一天：\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1515485936297070594)\n\nJack说巧不巧的发布了一个月球表情，**对应Ryoshi的推特背景，Shibarium的头像，即一轮满月。**\n\n当然，还有：\n\n[https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1515488578452668418)\n\n狗币创始人给了上方回复，一切尽在不言中，而一切，你知我知。\n\n**有了上方的脆弱关联指向：**\n\n于是，我们回到6月11号，**Twitter及Square创始人Jack Dorsey**旗下TBD项目开发负责人**Mike Brock**在Consensus 2022大会上宣布将**建立一个名为“Web 5”的去中心化网络平台。**\n据Mike Brock透露，Web5将为应用程序带来去中心化身份（DID）和数据存储服务，让开发人员专注于创造优质的用户体验，同时将数据和身份的所有权归还给个人。**Web 5的货币层将建立在比特币的基础上，目前仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。**\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5/)\n\n还记得在链上数据那一章节，caw的部署地址曾经给自己转账留言，表示**后续会迁移流动性吗**？那时候我们对流动性的迁移一头雾水，现在来看。更像是再为迁移至比特币做冷启动准备。又或者真的是QOM的L1，鬼知道呢？\n\n### Part 7 Mcafee\n\n没错，就是大家最喜欢的新机到家，第一时间先卸载的破安全软件。这家公司的官方TG，在停运的一年后，也就是今年6月前后，再度开始活跃。这都不是重点，主要是内容全是乌鸦以及近乎明牌。\n\n这家公司就一副老子知道秘密，但是一个屁也不会放的态度：\n\n[https://t.me/McafeeAfterlife/925](https://t.me/McafeeAfterlife/925)\n\n关注我，一个贪财好色又想装逼的作者：\n\n[https://twitter.com/yaje_nav](https://twitter.com/yaje_nav)\n\n",

A Web3 native communication platform](https://mirror.xyz/mail3.eth/HXwX3Mpf3epcmzpulaeInmvqRoz7WuONyaT4HfUDu8Q) by Mail3\n\n2022年6月13日\n\n私たちは最初の主要な開発が一通り終了したことをお知らせでき、大変嬉しく思います。Web3の夜明けに、Mail3はより効果的で価値のあるコミュニケーションを確立するため、すべてのWeb3ネイティブへサービスを提供すべくここにあります。\n\n## なぜWeb3ネイティブのコミュニケーションプラットフォームが必要なのか？\n\nブロックチェーンは、真に分散化されたインフラ上で構築されたオープンプロトコル、Dapps、DAOを私たちにもたらします。Web3は革新的なネットワークとして、人々がパーミッションレスで取引・収集したり、稼いだりする仕組みを実現し、チェーン上では「誰が何を所有しているか」を知ることができます。\n\nしかし、技術的要素の中で見逃されている部分が1つあります。それはメッセージングです。Whatsapp、Discord、Telegram、Gmailなど、今日、私たちにはたくさんのコミュニケーション手段があります。ではなぜそれらだけで十分ではないのでしょうか？まず、チェーン上で保有する所有権/アイデンティティとコミュニケーションとの間に簡単な接続方法がありません。そのためDAOはトークン所有者に投票を効率的に通知できず、一方ユーザーはNFTのコミュニティメンバーをすばやく見つけてコミュニケーションを取る方法がありません。さらに分散型社会のネイティブな決済システムは、従来のコミュニケーションプラットフォームと完全に切り離されています。ユーザーはチャットの中でトークンを転送することができず、メールを通じて友人にソウルバウンドトークンを送信することもできません。\n\nそこで私たちは、Web3ネイティブのコミュニケーションプラットフォームを確立するという、非常にシンプルかつ野心的なビジョンでMail3をスタートさせました。Web3のアイデンティティとWeb3の決済機能が組み込まれたことで、人々は効果的に連絡を取り合い、自由にコミュニケーションを取ることができます。\n\n## Mail3 アプリ\n\n### アドレス・ドメインでコミュニケーションを開始する\n\nウォレットアドレスはユーザーを自然に識別することができます。そしてウォレットアドレスをより読みやすくするために、ドメインネーム（ENSなど）が誕生しました。これによりMail3では、ユーザーがウォレットを接続すると、ウォレットアドレスとドメインネームを使ってメールアドレス（[0x1234512345@mail3.me](mailto:0x1234512345@mail3.me) や [alice.eth@mail.me](mailto:alice.eth@mail.me) ）を自動生成することができます。\n\nMail3はWeb3全体にサービスを提供することを目的としており、すべてのパブリックチェーンと対応するウォレット、およびドメインをサポートする予定です。\n\n### アドレス間のコミュニケーション\n\nアドレスにはウォレットアドレスとコントラクトアドレスの2種類があります。Mail3ではウォレット同士の通信とウォレットからコントラクトへの通信を実現するため、その両方に対応しています。\n\nウォレット間通信は全く新しい体験をもたらします。アドレスはWeb3における分散化された統一アカウントとして機能し、アリスはいつでもどこでもボブにメールを送ることができます。従来のメールでは通常、アリスがまずアカウントを作成し、自分のメールアドレスをボブに教えることで、ボブがアリスにメールを送ることができました。一方Mail3では、アリスが事前にMail3を登録しなくても、ボブが直接アリスにメッセージを送ることができます。アリスがMail3やMail3を利用したDappを訪れると、アリスは以前ボブから送られたメッセージを確認することができます。\n\nそしてコミュニケーションをより効果的にするのが、ウォレットからコントラクトへの通信です。コントラクトアドレスにメールを送ること（Mail3ではコミュニティメールと呼んでいます）で以下のようなことが可能です。\n\n* NFTシリーズの所有者全員に問い合わせを送信する\n* Defiプロトコルのハッキングについてすべての関係者に通知する\n* DAOトークン保有者に次回のDAOミーティングを連絡する\n\n### Web2とWeb3の連携\n\nMail3は標準的なSMTPプロトコルを採用しており、これによりMail3ユーザーは従来のEメールユーザーと通信することができます。私たちは、Mail3がWeb3の世界でしか使えない派手なWeb3デモではなく、人々が日常的に使う最も一般的なメールサービスになると信じているため、チームはあらゆる互換性の問題を調査し解決するために膨大な時間を費やしています。\n\n### Web3アイデンティティ\n\nアドレス間通信ではスパム問題が懸念されます。従来のメールボックスは、ユーザーによるメール内容の監視に依存した複雑なアルゴリズムによって詐欺を識別しています。ユーザーは自分のプライバシーを犠牲にし、なおかつ自分の受信箱をコントロールすることができません。\n\nMail3はユーザーのWeb3アイデンティティを採用することでこの問題を解決します。送信者のWeb3アイデンティティに基づき、誰が自分に連絡できるかをユーザー自身がコントロールできるようにしました。\n\nWeb3では、ユーザーのアイデンティティはチェーン上の行動（NFT、トークン、ソーシャルグラフ、TXなど）によって形成されます。ユーザーによる特定のNFTの所有、Poapの所有、所定のDAOメンバーシップ、Web3ソーシャルコネクション、あるいは上記の組み合わせなど、Mail3では今後多くの基準による受信箱のフィルター機能をサポートする予定です。\n\n## 今後の展望\n\n安全かつ使いやすいプライバシースキームの構築、他のアプリケーションやプロトコルとのコンポーザビリティ、決済システムの組み合わせ、価値あるコミュニケーションのためのエコノミーメカニズムの構築、クリプトネイティブの新たなビジネスモデル発見など、今後数ヶ月から数年の間に直面する多くの難題が残っていることは私たちも把握しています。\n\nしかしMail3 MVPの出発点は、いつでもどこでもみんなとコミュニケーションが取れるという、Web3の基本的な需要をサポートすることだと考えています。\n\n[https://app.mail3.me/?utm_source=mirror](https://app.mail3.me/?utm_source=mirror)\n\n私たちは、Web3ビルダーおよび愛好家のためにあらゆるフィードバックを必要としています。私たちをフォローし、ぜひコミュニティにご参加ください！\n\n### Discord\n\n[https://discord.gg/TssdsXyNfE](https://discord.gg/TssdsXyNfE)\n\n### Twitter\n\n[https://twitter.com/mail3dao](https://twitter.com/mail3dao)\n\n### 日本語ドキュメント\n\n[https://taka-eth.notion.site/Mail3-f81352d411064b87878156c3bea5b0e0](https://taka-eth.notion.site/Mail3-f81352d411064b87878156c3bea5b0e0)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658068789, "digest": "6-Z9htY7draDO2obwL43KFLn5WxlbYp3dFW0lxrpc2g", "contributor": "0x5550d9F1d786f5E0F32470D8F333181930e4B55C"}

It increases the scale at which we can operate.\n\nTechnology is built in our image, to fulfill our wants and needs.\n\nThis can be both good and bad.\n\nBecause it amplifies, technology will amplify both the good and the bad.\n\nIf we are unhealthy as a society, technology will amplify this unwellness.\n\nThose who have healed or are in the process of healing themselves can build and use technology for **good**.\n\nThe onus is on both the developer and the consumer.\n\nThe developer can develop a piece of technology that is entirely good, but it can be misused and abused by an unwell consumer. Everything must be consumed in moderation; with temperament and intentionality.\n\nIf a developer builds “good” technology that is abused by consumers with addictive habits, it will end up being “bad”.\n\nWe are discovering this first-hand — unrestricted capitalism combined with unrestricted technological advancement has forced technology down a path of maximum dopamine extraction and addiction. When likes/views are dollars, it is only a natural self-survival mechanism for technology to evolve towards things that can extract the most likes/views.\n\nA cause of this — for technology to have taken this path — is our addiction to cheap dopamine. Our addiction to “feeling good” at the expense of “acting good”. Our lack of intentionality and discipline. If everyone were only consuming healthy things, technology would instead be trending in a **healthy** direction while naturally pursuing maximal profit.\n\nPeople view “money” and “profit” as bad. The opposite is true. They are signals of productive value. However, because society is unwell, “productivity” to us is misguided. “Productivity” is cheap dopamine, big yachts, big houses, **consuming MORE**, etc.\n\nWhat if society instead valued other things? Then, money/profit would only be found in pursuing those other things.\n\nWe cannot expect natural selection to just “go away”. We cannot expect regulation to forever be our supplemental remedy for the dissonance between the natural order of the universe and the path of society.\n\nWe should accept the natural state of things for what it is, and try to build systems that succeed in harmony. We try too hard to resist — resistance in the form of coercion, force, bullying, etc.\n\nWe must flow with the natural order of the universe.\n\nWe are unwell.\n\nAnd our systems are unwell.\n\nAnd so our technology is unwell.\n\nWe are to blame.

{"id": "QHgpmRGUcF6IJEy4pGGYwhHxwjiIRxWqeO8b5PP-PlI", "title": "跟着V神，初探SBTs", "body": "SBT是什么\n\n是最早由V神在2022年1月提出的。全称为灵魂绑定代币Soul bound Token，是不可转让的非同质化代币（NFT），绑定在灵魂账户soul address中，可以简单理解为一种社会属性的凭证，代表个人用户独有的身份、声誉、资格等等。\n\n> Soul bound灵魂绑定，最大特征就是不可转让性，最早是源自魔兽世界里。一些有超能力的游戏物品都是灵魂绑定的，是不可以转移或售卖给别人的。所以玩家想获得这些超能力，不能通过购买，只能靠自己去杀死对应的怪物来获得他们的超能力）。可以这样理解，SBTs更多是非金融化的，不是用来交易的，是用来个人身份识别为主的。\n\n# Soul bound的意义价值\n\n社会经济价值创造很大部分是基于人类关系网络和社会信用体系。而在当前的web3中，是缺乏社会身份这一元素的。所以，当前web3发展是存在局限性的。\n\nSoul bound技术，能给当前缺失“社会身份”的web3.0带来社会身份，可以创建web3.0的信用体系。有了web3社会身份，就会有使得更多政治、经济、文化上更多用例产生，建立新的多元化的生态系统，建立“去中心化社会（DeSoc）”。\n\n# Soul bound目前应用方向\n\n* 传统NFT领域\n\n现在很多NFT（游戏道具/艺术品），都具备一定特殊稀缺价值和社交属性，但由于其可交易性，这些NFT更多彰显的是财富资产（能支付得起某某）。 Soul bound可以让NFT去金融化，持有某NFT，可以代表更多个人的特质，体现持有人本身具备了怎样的亲身经历/技能，或者是说通过持有NFT而支持某某领域，比如慈善项目NFT等。\n\n> *相关应用——POAP： the \"proof of attendance protocol\"，出席证明协议，代表了持有人参与了某事件/活动，或对此有过一定的贡献。*\n>\n> *活动方/品牌方/项目方（Issuers），可以在POAP平台上创建自己的活动（需要经过平台方的中心化的审核）。用户（collectors），可以通过参与线上或线下如discord社区会议等各类活动后，领取POAP徽章。（从项目方那获取mint链接，或者去POAP官网，去查询是否有领取资格）*\n>\n> *POAP mint发行，可以是线下机构，目前线上的项目方主要为元宇宙/游戏类项目为主，也有一定的Defi类项目。其中，比较有名的是元宇宙项目Decentraland（很多品牌方的POAP可以在里面认领）。关于交易方面，POAP本身妥协了，态度上是不鼓励徽章变成金融化的转让交易，徽章应作为承载和见证记录个体链上的美好生活的。但其底层技术上是支持可转让。目前，POAP 的二级市场是在Eporio（在XDAI也就是Gnosis链上的）。可以进行发送或者买卖交易。*\n\n另一个与NFT结合的方式是，当前NFT作品来源及稀缺性，往往由NFT市场权威上架保证。但未来，如果越来越多艺术家们能打造自身身份的souls账户，那么集结越多souls凭证的NFT作品，更能和伪造品区分开来。\n\n* **在Souldrops & DAO领域**\n\n传统的项目方发币空投，往往给到符合一定空投要求的一堆地址。用户获得空投后，很多就在二级市场套利变现。Souldrops可以改进当下的空投和DAO。最基础的作用就是，可以将SBTs来标识钱包，则可以区分机器人地址，降低女巫攻击，避免空投过于集中化或者囤积代币获取投票权。\n\n进一步地，SBTs可以纳入空投的要求，得到更精准地用户识别，来筛选要空投激励的对象，找到更贴合项目发展目标或宗旨的用户，这样比一般常规的空投计划目的性更强。也可以让普通空投代币设计转化SBTs，发放后在一定时间内，不可转让性生效，也就意味着治理权是被锁定不可交易的，之后可以由不可转让变为最终可转让的代币。也可以相反，让前期可转让的普通代币，之后可以解锁成为SBTs。这样做的目的，都是鼓励长期持有参与社区自治，降低项目代币的投机性参与度。另外，SBTs间存在一定相关性，所以在DAO方面也可以尝试通过降低相关性高的SBTs的权重，以此来让少数派也有发言的权利，或者是给与由更多特殊SBTs的群体更多投票权。\n\n总之，整体而言，无论是airdrop还是更广泛的DAO治理，soulbound都有很大的设计空间，来激励社区自治。\n\n> *相关应用——Proof-of-Humanity Protocol人类证明：允许链上事务与人类证明绑定。可以在智能合约上建立人类档案，原始所有者可以上传视频，如果后面得到视频不一致，则抵押资产就会移除掉。通过提交个人认证视频，经过他人担保后成功注册，形成抗女巫攻击的人类名单。对DAO创新治理、个人声誉建立、抗女巫攻击的代币空投等都有好处。*\n\n* **在Defi Lending领域**\n\n传统社会的无抵押借贷，是基于信用评级机制的，这个在当前web3.0是很难存在的。而借助soulbound，可以根据个人信誉发展信用抵押。\n\n> *相关的应用——CreDA Protocol：在传统defi的lending中引入了链上信用评级，将用户信用档案铸造成cNFT，从而使得借贷平台可根据cNFT等级，给予不同优惠利率或激励措施，提供个性化借贷服务。同时用户还可以基于信用评分加入信用网络，参与到信贷担保业务。CreDA 的信用评分是基于用户链上资产规模、参与Defi项目的链上行为活跃程度、参与Lending平台的贷款偿还记录等。*\n\n# Soul bound的社会恢复机制\n\n关于souls钱包地址和其中的SBTs，如果丢失，目前提倡的技术方案是将通过社会恢复Social recovery甚至是community recovery来实现的。对于普通的Social recovery，找回成功与否，在于与监护人“guardians'' 的信任关系是否还健康持久。更佳的方式是，把souls的恢复从由简单的Social recovery变为SBT community recovery，也就由那些SBTs相关的souls 或者说是背后归属的community，让他们来参与恢复。让souls钱包找回是基于souls关系网络的。当前，绝大多数web3.0的钱包，是不适用的SBTs，因为对于要承载一个人的身份的钱包来说，一定是要可以实现身份恢复的，而非是一旦遗失私钥无法恢复。因此像Argent 和 Loopring 这样的非监护式社会恢复钱包，可以进行这块的探索。另外，正是因为这种社会网络下的恢复机制，也间接保证了souls的出售，因为出售的话，卖方是没办法保证他不会再去恢复的。\n\n# Soul bound的隐私设计\n\n当前链上数据全部公开，但如果广泛运用后SBTs，多种SBTs映射成了一个个人像图谱，链上活动就会更加反映一个个具象的个体、有身份的人类活动，存在信息过度公开化。那么，对身份隐私性的保护也会更加重要。目前相关隐私保护和数据授权的技术方案有以下几种：\n\n1.

{"id": "0-Oowy-4v68dlVEpqK4Zs4a7m4cX2--EYkhLhyH_m-Y", "title": "跟着V神，初探SBTs", "body": "# SBT是什么\n\n是最早由V神在2022年1月提出的。全称为灵魂绑定代币Soul bound Token，是不可转让的非同质化代币（NFT），绑定在灵魂账户soul address中，可以简单理解为一种社会属性的凭证，代表个人用户独有的身份、声誉、资格等等。\n\n> Soul bound灵魂绑定，最大特征就是不可转让性，最早是源自魔兽世界里。一些有超能力的游戏物品都是灵魂绑定的，是不可以转移或售卖给别人的。所以玩家想获得这些超能力，不能通过购买，只能靠自己去杀死对应的怪物来获得他们的超能力）。可以这样理解，SBTs更多是非金融化的，不是用来交易的，是用来个人身份识别为主的。\n\n# Soul bound意义价值\n\n社会经济价值创造很大部分是基于人类关系网络和社会信用体系。而在当前的web3中，是缺乏社会身份这一元素的。所以，当前web3发展是存在局限性的。\n\nSoul bound技术，能给当前缺失“社会身份”的web3.0带来社会身份，可以创建web3.0的信用体系。有了web3社会身份，就会有使得更多政治、经济、文化上更多用例产生，建立新的多元化的生态系统，建立“去中心化社会（DeSoc）”。\n\n# Soul bound目前应用方向\n\n* 传统NFT领域\n\n现在很多NFT（游戏道具/艺术品），都具备一定特殊稀缺价值和社交属性，但由于其可交易性，这些NFT更多彰显的是财富资产（能支付得起某某）。 Soul bound可以让NFT去金融化，持有某NFT，可以代表更多个人的特质，体现持有人本身具备了怎样的亲身经历/技能，或者是说通过持有NFT而支持某某领域，比如慈善项目NFT等。\n\n> *相关应用——POAP： the \"proof of attendance protocol\"，出席证明协议，代表了持有人参与了某事件/活动，或对此有过一定的贡献。*\n>\n> *活动方/品牌方/项目方（Issuers），可以在POAP平台上创建自己的活动（需要经过平台方的中心化的审核）。用户（collectors），可以通过参与线上或线下如discord社区会议等各类活动后，领取POAP徽章。（从项目方那获取mint链接，或者去POAP官网，去查询是否有领取资格）*\n>\n> *POAP mint发行，可以是线下机构，目前线上的项目方主要为元宇宙/游戏类项目为主，也有一定的Defi类项目。其中，比较有名的是元宇宙项目Decentraland（很多品牌方的POAP可以在里面认领）。关于交易方面，POAP本身妥协了，态度上是不鼓励徽章变成金融化的转让交易，徽章应作为承载和见证记录个体链上的美好生活的。但其底层技术上是支持可转让。目前，POAP 的二级市场是在Eporio（在XDAI也就是Gnosis链上的）。可以进行发送或者买卖交易。*\n\n另一个与NFT结合的方式是，当前NFT作品来源及稀缺性，往往由NFT市场权威上架保证。但未来，如果越来越多艺术家们能打造自身身份的souls账户，那么集结越多souls凭证的NFT作品，更能和伪造品区分开来。\n\n* **在Souldrops & DAO领域**\n\n传统的项目方发币空投，往往给到符合一定空投要求的一堆地址。用户获得空投后，很多就在二级市场套利变现。Souldrops可以改进当下的空投和DAO。最基础的作用就是，可以将SBTs来标识钱包，则可以区分机器人地址，降低女巫攻击，避免空投过于集中化或者囤积代币获取投票权。\n\n进一步地，SBTs可以纳入空投的要求，得到更精准地用户识别，来筛选要空投激励的对象，找到更贴合项目发展目标或宗旨的用户，这样比一般常规的空投计划目的性更强。也可以让普通空投代币设计转化SBTs，发放后在一定时间内，不可转让性生效，也就意味着治理权是被锁定不可交易的，之后可以由不可转让变为最终可转让的代币。也可以相反，让前期可转让的普通代币，之后可以解锁成为SBTs。这样做的目的，都是鼓励长期持有参与社区自治，降低项目代币的投机性参与度。另外，SBTs间存在一定相关性，所以在DAO方面也可以尝试通过降低相关性高的SBTs的权重，以此来让少数派也有发言的权利，或者是给与由更多特殊SBTs的群体更多投票权。\n\n总之，整体而言，无论是airdrop还是更广泛的DAO治理，soulbound都有很大的设计空间，来激励社区自治。\n\n> *相关应用——Proof-of-Humanity Protocol人类证明：允许链上事务与人类证明绑定。可以在智能合约上建立人类档案，原始所有者可以上传视频，如果后面得到视频不一致，则抵押资产就会移除掉。通过提交个人认证视频，经过他人担保后成功注册，形成抗女巫攻击的人类名单。对DAO创新治理、个人声誉建立、抗女巫攻击的代币空投等都有好处。*\n\n* **在Defi Lending领域**\n\n传统社会的无抵押借贷，是基于信用评级机制的，这个在当前web3.0是很难存在的。而借助soulbound，可以根据个人信誉发展信用抵押。\n\n> *相关的应用——CreDA Protocol：在传统defi的lending中引入了链上信用评级，将用户信用档案铸造成cNFT，从而使得借贷平台可根据cNFT等级，给予不同优惠利率或激励措施，提供个性化借贷服务。同时用户还可以基于信用评分加入信用网络，参与到信贷担保业务。CreDA 的信用评分是基于用户链上资产规模、参与Defi项目的链上行为活跃程度、参与Lending平台的贷款偿还记录等。*\n\n# Soul bound的社会恢复机制\n\n关于souls钱包地址和其中SBTs，如果丢失，目前提倡的技术方案是将通过社会恢复Social recovery甚至是community recovery来实现的。对于普通的Social recovery，找回成功与否，在于与监护人“guardians'' 的信任关系是否还健康持久。更佳的方式是，把souls的恢复从由简单的Social recovery变为SBT community recovery，也就由那些SBTs相关的souls 或者说是背后归属的community，让他们来参与恢复。\n\n当前，绝大多数web3.0的钱包，是不适用的SBTs，因为对于要承载一个人的身份的钱包来说，一定是要可以实现身份恢复的，而非是一旦遗失私钥无法恢复。因此像Argent 和 Loopring 这样的非监护式社会恢复钱包，可以进行这块的探索。另外，正是因为这种社会网络下的恢复机制，也间接保证了souls的出售，因为出售的话，卖方是没办法保证他不会再去恢复的。\n\n# Soul bound的隐私设计\n\n当前链上数据全部公开，但如果广泛运用后SBTs，多种SBTs映射成了一个个人像图谱，链上活动就会更加反映一个个具象的个体、有身份的人类活动，存在信息过度公开化。那么，对身份隐私性的保护也会更加重要。目前相关隐私保护和数据授权的技术方案有以下几种：\n\n1. SBTs存在于链下，但提交SBTs的哈希值给到链上。由持有人自行决定何时公开。（储存在链下，持有人自行持有，由索引、收件人地址、收件人secret所得到得哈希值。只有公开secret和给收件人他们的Merkle 分支，外界才能够看到持有哪些物品。）\n2. 运用零知识证明加密技术“zero knowledge proofs”。证明持有，但不透露过多信息比如个人身份。\n\n# Soulboud未来\n\n实践道阻且长，soulbound是DeSoc的起点而非终点，会把web3推向新型社会信用网络。而针对Soulbond的最主要的标志性特征是不可转让，过程中会有不同程度的“不可以转让交易”尝试或者是妥协实现。如当下有的将NFT和ENS绑定，则有的人会因为在意其ENS，而选择不转移NFT，从而一定程度实现了不可转让性。又如，前期可实现具有可撤销的功能，也就是可以通过一定身份认证进行撤销和重新发行，成为可撤销、可转让的代币。这样，间接降低SBTs被金融化出售的可能性。", "timestamp": 1658070202, "digest": "s8lT1ZUYkGRS3f2fknPANcR5higwNLreN_2gDniWcJs", "contributor": "0x133C06D8CF2e9571F641e6c50BfEa9C9B944589c"}

SBTs存在于链下，但提交SBTs的哈希值给到链上。由持有人自行决定何时公开。（储存在链下，持有人自行持有，由索引、收件人地址、收件人secret所得到得哈希值。只有公开secret和给收件人他们的Merkle 分支，外界才能够看到持有哪些物品。）\n2. 运用零知识证明加密技术“zero knowledge proofs”。证明持有，但不透露过多信息比如个人身份。\n\n# Soulboud未来\n\n实践道阻且长，soulbound是DeSoc的起点而非终点，会把web3推向新型社会信用网络。而针对Soulbond的最主要的标志性特征是不可转让，过程中会有不同程度的“不可以转让交易”尝试或者是妥协实现。如当下有的将NFT和ENS绑定，则有的人会因为在意其ENS，而选择不转移NFT，从而一定程度实现了不可转让性。又如，前期可实现具有可撤销的功能，也就是可以通过一定身份认证进行撤销和重新发行，成为可撤销、可转让的代币。这样，间接降低SBTs被金融化出售的可能性。", "timestamp": 1658070634, "digest": "p1ZzRWKRsXCOxRYo1fJoM5AbNQ6KJ6UDslv_OVhqDt0", "contributor": "0x133C06D8CF2e9571F641e6c50BfEa9C9B944589c"}

The common ants in the indoor environment are small yellow ant and so on.", "timestamp": 1658070745, "digest": "59RCBkfM-_Dptr4ODX4GuCAVy2b75KxEDoZSG_C3t3g", "contributor": "0xd1C1c988BEd64Df3A1a95dCf81B9144C66DB4C93"}
{"id": "S6wjJK3HQeVmG0VA-_fFsoiIzmKcMsZAdfkkzykAIJg", "title": "跟着V神，初探SBTs", "body": "[https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)\n\n[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)\n\n# SBT是什么\n\n是最早由V神在2022年1月提出的。全称为灵魂绑定代币Soul bound Token，是不可转让的非同质化代币（NFT），绑定在灵魂账户soul address中，可以简单理解为一种社会属性的凭证，代表个人用户独有的身份、声誉、资格等等。\n\n> Soul bound灵魂绑定，最大特征就是不可转让性，最早是源自魔兽世界里。一些有超能力的游戏物品都是灵魂绑定的，是不可以转移或售卖给别人的。所以玩家想获得这些超能力，不能通过购买，只能靠自己去杀死对应的怪物来获得他们的超能力）。可以这样理解，SBTs更多是非金融化的，不是用来交易的，是用来个人身份识别为主的。\n\n# Soul bound意义价值\n\n社会经济价值创造很大部分是基于人类关系网络和社会信用体系。而在当前的web3中，是缺乏社会身份这一元素的。所以，当前web3发展是存在局限性的。\n\nSoul bound技术，能给当前缺失“社会身份”的web3.0带来社会身份，可以创建web3.0的信用体系。有了web3社会身份，就会有使得更多政治、经济、文化上更多用例产生，建立新的多元化的生态系统，建立“去中心化社会（DeSoc）”。\n\n# Soul bound目前应用方向\n\n* **传统NFT领域**\n\n现在很多NFT（游戏道具/艺术品），都具备一定特殊稀缺价值和社交属性，但由于其可交易性，这些NFT更多彰显的是财富资产（能支付得起某某）。 Soul bound可以让NFT去金融化，持有某NFT，可以代表更多个人的特质，体现持有人本身具备了怎样的亲身经历/技能，或者是说通过持有NFT而支持某某领域，比如慈善项目NFT等。\n\n> *相关应用——POAP： the \"proof of attendance protocol\"，出席证明协议，代表了持有人参与了某事件/活动，或对此有过一定的贡献。*\n>\n> *活动方/品牌方/项目方（Issuers），可以在POAP平台上创建自己的活动（需要经过平台方的中心化的审核）。用户（collectors），可以通过参与线上或线下如discord社区会议等各类活动后，领取POAP徽章。（从项目方那获取mint链接，或者去POAP官网，去查询是否有领取资格）*\n>\n> *POAP mint发行，可以是线下机构，目前线上的项目方主要为元宇宙/游戏类项目为主，也有一定的Defi类项目。其中，比较有名的是元宇宙项目Decentraland（很多品牌方的POAP可以在里面认领）。关于交易方面，POAP本身妥协了，态度上是不鼓励徽章变成金融化的转让交易，徽章应作为承载和见证记录个体链上的美好生活的。但其底层技术上是支持可转让。目前，POAP 的二级市场是在Eporio（在XDAI也就是Gnosis链上的）。可以进行发送或者买卖交易。*\n\n另一个与NFT结合的方式是，当前NFT作品来源及稀缺性，往往由NFT市场权威上架保证。但未来，如果越来越多艺术家们能打造自身身份的souls账户，那么集结越多souls凭证的NFT作品，更能和伪造品区分开来。\n\n* **Souldrops & DAO领域**\n\n传统的项目方发币空投，往往给到符合一定空投要求的一堆地址。用户获得空投后，很多就在二级市场套利变现。Souldrops可以改进当下的空投和DAO。最基础的作用就是，可以将SBTs来标识钱包，则可以区分机器人地址，降低女巫攻击，避免空投过于集中化或者囤积代币获取投票权。\n\n进一步地，SBTs可以纳入空投的要求，得到更精准地用户识别，来筛选要空投激励的对象，找到更贴合项目发展目标或宗旨的用户，这样比一般常规的空投计划目的性更强。也可以让普通空投代币设计转化SBTs，发放后在一定时间内，不可转让性生效，也就意味着治理权是被锁定不可交易的，之后可以由不可转让变为最终可转让的代币。也可以相反，让前期可转让的普通代币，之后可以解锁成为SBTs。这样做的目的，都是鼓励长期持有参与社区自治，降低项目代币的投机性参与度。另外，SBTs间存在一定相关性，所以在DAO方面也可以尝试通过降低相关性高的SBTs的权重，以此来让少数派也有发言的权利，或者是给与由更多特殊SBTs的群体更多投票权。\n\n总之，整体而言，无论是airdrop还是更广泛的DAO治理，soulbound都有很大的设计空间，来激励社区自治。\n\n> *相关应用——Proof-of-Humanity Protocol人类证明：允许链上事务与人类证明绑定。可以在智能合约上建立人类档案，原始所有者可以上传视频，如果后面得到视频不一致，则抵押资产就会移除掉。通过提交个人认证视频，经过他人担保后成功注册，形成抗女巫攻击的人类名单。对DAO创新治理、个人声誉建立、抗女巫攻击的代币空投等都有好处。*\n\n* **Defi Lending领域**\n\n传统社会的无抵押借贷，是基于信用评级机制的，这个在当前web3.0是很难存在的。而借助soulbound，可以根据个人信誉发展信用抵押。\n\n> *相关的应用——CreDA Protocol：在传统defi的lending中引入了链上信用评级，将用户信用档案铸造成cNFT，从而使得借贷平台可根据cNFT等级，给予不同优惠利率或激励措施，提供个性化借贷服务。同时用户还可以基于信用评分加入信用网络，参与到信贷担保业务。CreDA 的信用评分是基于用户链上资产规模、参与Defi项目的链上行为活跃程度、参与Lending平台的贷款偿还记录等。*\n\n# Soul bound的社会恢复机制\n\n关于souls钱包地址和其中SBTs，如果丢失，目前提倡的技术方案是将通过社会恢复Social recovery甚至是community recovery来实现的。对于普通的Social recovery，找回成功与否，在于与监护人“guardians'' 的信任关系是否还健康持久。更佳的方式是，把souls的恢复从由简单的Social recovery变为SBT community recovery，也就由那些SBTs相关的souls 或者说是背后归属的community，让他们来参与恢复。\n\n当前，绝大多数web3.0的钱包，是不适用的SBTs，因为对于要承载一个人的身份的钱包来说，一定是要可以实现身份恢复的，而非是一旦遗失私钥无法恢复。因此像Argent 和 Loopring 这样的非监护式社会恢复钱包，可以进行这块的探索。另外，正是因为这种社会网络下的恢复机制，也间接保证了souls的出售，因为出售的话，卖方是没办法保证他不会再去恢复的。\n\n# Soul bound的隐私设计\n\n当前链上数据全部公开，但如果广泛运用后SBTs，多种SBTs映射成了一个个人像图谱，链上活动就会更加反映一个个具象的个体、有身份的人类活动，存在信息过度公开化。那么，对身份隐私性的保护也会更加重要。目前相关隐私保护和数据授权的技术方案有以下几种：\n\n1. SBTs存在于链下，但提交SBTs的哈希值给到链上。由持有人自行决定何时公开。（储存在链下，持有人自行持有，由索引、收件人地址、收件人secret所得到得哈希值。只有公开secret和给收件人他们的Merkle 分支，外界才能够看到持有哪些物品。）\n2. 运用零知识证明加密技术“zero knowledge proofs”。证明持有，但不透露过多信息比如个人身份。\n\n# Soulboud未来\n\n实践道阻且长，soulbound是DeSoc的起点而非终点，会把web3推向新型社会信用网络。而针对Soulbond的最主要的标志性特征是不可转让，过程中会有不同程度的“不可以转让交易”尝试或者是妥协实现。如当下有的将NFT和ENS绑定，则有的人会因为在意其ENS，而选择不转移NFT，从而一定程度实现了不可转让性。又如，前期可实现具有可撤销的功能，也就是可以通过一定身份认证进行撤销和重新发行，成为可撤销、可转让的代币。这样，间接降低SBTs被金融化出售的可能性。", "timestamp": 1658070855, "digest": "_UV2yjwpUABz23nZIwQgFX6zm3BPyOwq0wQioMpFPW0", "contributor": "0x133C06D8CF2e9571F641e6c50BfEa9C9B944589c"}
{"id": "lbAAzvh0pKDzfrHn79TBXIrEvtm-kQ5HbIeR8sRwwqc", "title": "Relation: New branding to explore data value on top of Web3 social graph", "body": "## A fresh start to better discover the Web3 ecosystem\n\n**Today, we are pleased to announce that [Relation](https://relationlabs.ai/) has launched a brand new website with a highly stylish logo after a month of preparation.** Relation has now enabled the unlocking of the personalized Web3 social graph. Relation has completed a seed round of funding at a valuation of **US$20 million**, it has successfully secured capital backing from Hashkey Capital, SNZ, Signum Capital, and others. With a team of over 20 full-time members, our vision is to provide the most powerful and data-enriched social graph for the global multi-chain ecosystem, jointly explore a new paradigm of people and organizations, relationships and behaviors in the next generation of the Web3 Internet, and **become the next generation of social infrastructure for Web3.**\n\nThe new design of the Relation logo is simple and generous, with dots as the elements and a hexagonal shape, expressing a rounded world and an attitude of cooperation and symbiosis. The dots in the middle represent the indispensable social relationships in the Web3 world. At the same time, the pink fading to purple turns static into dynamic, expressing the once, twice, and even N degrees of interpersonal relationships that arise as the social relationships deepen, which is the core of Relation’s focus. From the overall Roadmap perspective, we will continue to expand more tools and services and attract more ecological participants to join us, always adhering to a cooperative and symbiotic win-win attitude and growing together with Web3.\n\n## Redefining data sovereignty and exploring the value of Web3 social data\n\nThe current development of the Internet has deviated from its initial design. As users move from being recipients of information to participants, their digital behaviors on the web are recorded and in the form of data assets held by tech companies. Online personal data never belongs to them, instead, it becomes a profit-making tool for the Big Names. Yes, technology-based giants such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter benefit from the vast amount of data available, taking control of your world with their algorithms. Imagine if one day they went out of business and shut down our social accounts, all the dynamics we have posted, and the network of relationships we have built would disappear with them. It’s a shame to say that we create data that we never really had.\n\nLikewise, strong isolation exists among the Internet oligarchs, they protect user data in their own way. We cannot easily export the information and network of relationships from Twitter to Facebook. We need to recreate accounts and spend more time building a new network of relationships. There is no better way we can do it.\n\nWe believe that Web3, an evolution of the current Internet, is a very creative era. Based on blockchain technology and native tokens, it offers a decentralized, open, and boundless way of interacting with people. Instead of creating multiple identities on various centralized platforms, we can associate all user on-chain addresses with a unified decentralized digital identity, enabling users to store and manage their data and digital assets based on privacy protocols and keys. It will empower individuals by taking back data sovereignty, gaining the benefits of the data they created, and owning control of their data.\n\n**Relation’s vision of *One person, One private key, One data space, One data sovereignty, All in one,*** is to give Web3 users control over their data. We decouple social relationship data from the Web3 application and store it in data space that the user is in full control of. Users can store, manage and modify any data in the data space, including contacts, game assets, DAO identities, wallet assets, and DApp authorizations. Users can determine the content, scope, and length of open access to their social relationship data through the permissions management suite. We will help the user earn rewards through Data to earn in our subsequent plans.\n\n## Relation One supports unlocking the social graph and building a social network on Web3\n\nRelation One is a social DApp built by Relation Labs for Web3 users to easily manage their social relationship data and get friend matching and interest recommendation services. **Its built-in one-stop social features include personal profile management, on-chain identity management, P2P chat, group chat, DAO, NFT avatar display, friend invitation, private domain game rank, etc.** Currently, users are supported to log in quickly through wallet applications such as MetaMask, Internet Identity, and Polkadot. In the future, more wallet login portals from the public chain ecosystem will be integrated, making it easy for any crypto user to experience the social applications of Relation One. For now, Relation Labs will subsidize a 1T Gas Fee per user to create a private data-space with 0 cost interaction.\n\nAfter adding a multi-chain address on Relation One, users will quickly get an exclusive Web3 personality tag. They can get accurate matching of friends on the chain and recommend services for enthusiasts with the same interests, forming a personal-centric visual Web3 social graph and quickly building a social network they know and trust in the Web3 world. In the future, users can easily get all push notifications sent from connected DApps or NFTs, on the corresponding chains in Relation One. Users get a better engagement experience when using new applications without creating data repeatedly.\n\n**In the next phase, Relation will bring in an economic model to enable revenue generation from users' authorized data through a Data-to-Earn scheme.** Users will be able to provide the value of their social data to the DApp side or relevant stakeholders through open licensing and share the corresponding revenue.\n\n**Relation Link Tool Suite for quick access to the Web3 Social Graph**\n\nBased on the development and operation of Relation One, Relation has provided a typical example of a Web3 social DApp, a pioneering exercise in exploring the value of Web3 social graph data. We have built the Relation Link Tool Suite to support all public chain DApps and their developers to quickly access Web3 social graph data and modularly combine the social components of Relation One like Lego. Relation aims to help DApps quickly explore business opportunities, increase social attributes, improve user stickiness and gain effective user growth in a cost-effective way.\n\n**We offer the open-source Relation *Graph access query API*, *Relation Dashboard API*, *modular social functionality components*, and *multi-chain smart contract wallet solutions*.** Relation provides development scaffolding that is easy to develop, test, and deploy for developers. No developer is required to understand the underlying protocols, and contracts can be deployed efficiently with the help of our front-end templates, enabling low-code development.\n\n**We also explore diverse Web3 track DApps and tap into potential usage scenarios.** For example, DID will acquire valuable on-chain users after linking the Relation Graph to co-construct a pervasive Web3 reputation system based on their social relationship data. Another example is that GameFi projects can integrate the chat function, invite friends function, Rank PK, and other functions of our social function component to increase the stickiness of their community users and expand their user base. Or even a SocialFi project can start a business quickly by adopting the open-source Relation One use case, without the high cost, leaving them more time and energy to focus on their business logic to better serve their users.\n\n## Relation Graph, the core engine of Relation\n\n**Relation Graph is the first graph database written in Rust and deployed on WASM and is the underlying core engine of Relation.** As the basis for the construction of Relation Social Graph, it provides graph storage, graph query, graph computation, graph analysis, and basic database technology capabilities. It will extend with technical modules for graph visualization and graph neural networks. Using the graph database as the underlying storage engine for complex social data and providing a SPARQL query language interface, we help Web3 DApps achieve a higher-order data application paradigm and more granularly exploit the value of social relationship data.\n\nRelation Graph is storing the authorized data of users and provides data interfaces to support data analysis and data mining in the upper layer. Relation Social Graph will synchronize after users update their authorization data and aggregate all users’ authorization data with the public data in each blockchain network. It will eventually build an N-degree social relationship graph of users based on their on-chain behavior, asset status, and interest preferences in different blockchain networks. Users or other DApps can quickly get the Relation Social Graph analysis results without complicated calculations when they make deep queries. All these operations, which were not possible on the native blockchain, became a reality with the technical support of Relation Graph. **We currently provide enriched data analysis modules based on the underlying graph database, including N-degree relationship recommendations, content subscription push, etc. We will subsequently support higher-order behavioral trend prediction, business intelligence, AI, and other data services.**\n\nWe support developers to customize their graph databases to suit their business characteristics and help massive amounts of multi-chain user relationship data storage. Compared to SQL relational data, Relation Graph is more efficient than SQL relational data. As the development of Web3 social networks is not and should not be limited to one public chain, the Relation Social Graph will become more and more abundant as Relation moves towards a multi-chain ecosystem.\n\n## Relation, the new social networking paradigm\n\nThe Web3 era has begun and all kinds of applications are being reinvented. Along our way of exploration, we are surprised to find that the social graph can easily integrate with finance, games, NFT, and other DApps to form a complete closed-loop with stronger business and user connections. Relation is creating a new paradigm of social applications, making applications more sociable and bringing more people to Web3. We are on the way.\n\n[https://relationlabs.ai/#/bazaar](https://relationlabs.ai/#/bazaar)\n\n# About Relation Labs\n\nRelation’s long-term positioning is committed to being a social graph data value explorer onWeb3. Our vision is to provide the most powerful and wealthy social relationship graph for the global multi-chain ecosystem, jointly explore a new paradigm of people and organizations, relationships and behaviors in the Web3, and become the next-generation social infrastructure for Web3.\n\n[Website](https://relationlabs.ai/?utm_source=report) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/relationlabs) | [Github](https://github.com/relationlabs) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/whGB5zEsHY) | [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/relationlabs.eth) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@RelationLabs) | [Telegram](https://t.me/therelationlabs) | [Documentation](https://kziov-eaaaa-aaaag-aaaxa-cai.ic0.app/ic_one.html)", "timestamp": 1658071311, "digest": "YewHEXx2yqBVwljhXvkwfB5GhCRGKNRusMjYT95AzE8", "contributor": "0x98e7A928616121BFd88A68F2Fa73040efdb02167"}
