Qual foi a razão do meu interesse? A necessidade de sentir na pele os preços a subir, o salário estagnado e uma ambição de descobrir a razão e o porquê de ser um afortunado com este presente que é a vida.\n\nSempre gostei de pessoas, de as ouvir mas nunca tive interesse por política ou como o dinheiro funciona, até mesmo o que é o dinheiro, como a razão de o usarmos e o idolatrar todos os dias. No entanto, depois de alguns anos de independência percebi que a falta de interesse de minha parte foi induzida e programada na “folha em branco” desde o nascimento. Na minha opinião, esta folha em branco não está vazia, limpa e pronta para outras pessoas pintarem com as cores e texturas que idealizam. Acredito que quando nascemos a nossa tela já tem cor e desejos, não importa quais são, só sei que não é “branca”. \n\nÉ com este desabafo que tentarei transmitir o que tenho estado a aprender, a informação que tenho consumido sobre as peças do jogo que é a vida. Espero que seja útil para vocês. \n\nLembrem-se é um desabafo de esperança num mundo que parece, mas não tem os dias contados.", "timestamp": 1658526123, "digest": "0MYKBvL1ukG9z7K703-adDGxLIXo726xtaGy9HOCnU8", "contributor": "0x73fE410a9Ddf5b0Aba04D1294c1BB7935993E28a"}

Adjust Level 2 requirements (long executor)\n  * This proposal is for the Aave community's approval to modify the governance standards (proposition power, quorum vote differential) for Level 2 ideas, which will have an impact on the most important parts of the Aave ecosystem.\n  * From the perspective of the BGD, this is strongly advised because those requirements were established in the past when the AAVE fragmentation was different and because it could result in the creation of an artificial and self-imposed bottleneck to pass proposals that, given their technical nature, shouldn't really face opposition.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe1e42fd73a2d734d78a65e514a6996c785e90bc82a2e896825dd4af003aeec15); \\[BIP-29\\] Introduce GaugeAdder v2\n  * The GaugeAdder is a component of veBAL architecture that securely facilitates the process of adding new gauges to the system. It incorporates checks to make sure that only gauges deployed from authorized gauge makers can be included in the veBAL system and become eligible for BAL emissions. \n  * The GaugeAdder has to be updated to handle this extension as we are ready to add gauges from additional networks. The smart contracts team at Balancer Labs has deployed a coordinator contract to facilitate this upgrading.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xf354daf0ed08373938b30da9e47e8814fd8922881eb6baf6560ae34b78ceeb5b); \\[BIP-31\\] Authorize the Batch Relayer v3\n  * The functionality included in v3 is mainly intended to help with the upcoming migration of stabal3 and bb-a-USD to the soon-to-be-deployed new version of bb-a-USD. The previously known vulnerabilities are addressed in this updated bb-a-USD, which also adds new functionality like recovery mode and the capacity to charge the Aave yield the Balancer's protocol cost.\n  * The new Batch Relayer will also be able to stake and unstake on the user's behalf in the gauges. This will make it possible to complete the aforementioned migration in a single transaction (after the user has approved the Batch Relayer). Additionally, it can make claims for user rewards from gauges, creating the prospect of claim-invest-stake flows for a single transaction.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x29a37ab71ce03a5e167fd012c363e72088bd0554d2b25c99f3373fa7cceb7124); \\[BIP-32\\] Funding Proposal for Daoism Systems: PROTOCOL REVENUE SHARING FOR POOL & FACTORY CREATORS\n  * In Berlin, Daoism Systems was established in January 2022 by computer scientists, engineers, and researchers to develop on-chain solutions for web3 enterprises. \n  * The team is taking the initiative with this proposal to forge closer ties between Daoism Systems and Balancer and to contribute our skills to the expansion of Balancer's ecosystem.\n  * The author sincerely feels that implementing the revenue-sharing protocol for pool and factory designers will enhance Balancer's governance efficacy and make it more appealing for developers to build new products on top of Balancer.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x797467e0b451a49773cfea97359a32ab880caee688d16fe7db41f94a4e0570f0); \\[BIP-33\\] Orb Marketing Budget Proposal for the Remainder of Q3\n  * This proposal aims to continue Balancer marketing within the newly funded Orb Collective Service Provider (SP), under the new Operating Framework. \n  * The Orb marketing team wants to hasten Balancer Protocol's development and public exposure. The marketing demands of Balancer are ever-evolving. Each advertising campaign, product launch, or announcement is unique and designed for the occasion. Instead of semi-annually or annually, the team will ask for a budget every three months to make the biggest impact and show off Balancer's full potential. Balancer has reduced numerous expenses in order to be as lean as possible and whether the current market while it is in the middle of a bear cycle.\n  * For the remainder of Q3, a budget of $ 76,770.00 has been requested. The entire Orb team will receive a monthly review, and any leftover funds will be carried over and applied to the budget request for the upcoming quarter.\n\n***Public Goods***\n\n* [ENS Tempcheck;](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-q3-q4-budget-request-meta-governance-working-group/13754) Q3/Q4 Budget Request\n  * This is a temp check for the budget request for Meta Governance WG Q3/Q4 of $632,000\n    * Subgroup Multi-sigs - $200,000\n    * Compensation - $179,000\n    * Unallocated - $45,000\n\n***Infrastructure & Tooling***\n\n* [Rocket Pool Discussion;](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/odao-security-model/858) oDAO Compensation + Security Model\n  * This proposal outlines how much oDAO is getting paid \n    * \\~150K a year per oDAO member\n    * \\~2.4M in total per year\n  * This proposal also seeks to lower the amount that RP is paying out to the oDAO, arguing that RP could get the same level of security at a fraction of the price.\n  * Wander suggests a reduction of 80% to the compensation at a longer-term deal structure.\n\n***Creator Economy***\n\n* [SuperRare Tempcheck;](https://forum.superrare.com/t/sip-variety-is-the-spice-of-life/878) Variety is the Spice of Life.\n  * This is a temp check for the diversification of SuperRare’s treasury into stablecoins.\n  * Currently, the treasury has $109M in $RARE and $9.5M in ETH.\n  * This proposal seeks to put 20% of these assets into USDC/DAI along with 20% of future revenues.\n  * The public will be made aware of any OTC or private purchases of stablecoins\n* [Bankless Tempcheck;](https://forum.bankless.community/t/panvala-x-banklessdao/3962) Panvala x Bankless\n  * This proposal seeks to add Bankless to the Panvala ecosystem.\n  * The Panvala ecosystem is a collection of projects that receive grants through Pan tokens and NFTs.\n  * The utility of these grants is diluted through token supply but this does not seem like it has a downside for bdao.\n  * If you have an opinion or experience with Panvala please share in the general discussion in discord.", "timestamp": 1658525503, "digest": "nS57-fpXIQKXftuqTeVaqugC1WxcsYYFPb1whP0ojmw", "contributor": "0x38264D418E6C7A214eaDBBCa163A8d38156944e6"}
