Qual foi a razão do meu interesse? A necessidade de sentir na pele os preços a subir, o salário estagnado e uma ambição de descobrir a razão e o porquê de ser um afortunado com este presente que é a vida.\n\nSempre gostei de pessoas, de as ouvir mas nunca tive interesse por política ou como o dinheiro funciona, até mesmo o que é o dinheiro, como a razão de o usarmos e o idolatrar todos os dias. No entanto, depois de alguns anos de independência percebi que a falta de interesse de minha parte foi induzida e programada na “folha em branco” desde o nascimento. Na minha opinião, esta folha em branco não está vazia, limpa e pronta para outras pessoas pintarem com as cores e texturas que idealizam. Acredito que quando nascemos a nossa tela já tem cor e desejos, não importa quais são, só sei que não é “branca”. \n\nÉ com este desabafo que tentarei transmitir o que tenho estado a aprender, a informação que tenho consumido sobre as peças do jogo que é a vida.

Adjust Level 2 requirements (long executor)\n  * This proposal is for the Aave community's approval to modify the governance standards (proposition power, quorum vote differential) for Level 2 ideas, which will have an impact on the most important parts of the Aave ecosystem.\n  * From the perspective of the BGD, this is strongly advised because those requirements were established in the past when the AAVE fragmentation was different and because it could result in the creation of an artificial and self-imposed bottleneck to pass proposals that, given their technical nature, shouldn't really face opposition.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe1e42fd73a2d734d78a65e514a6996c785e90bc82a2e896825dd4af003aeec15); \\[BIP-29\\] Introduce GaugeAdder v2\n  * The GaugeAdder is a component of veBAL architecture that securely facilitates the process of adding new gauges to the system. It incorporates checks to make sure that only gauges deployed from authorized gauge makers can be included in the veBAL system and become eligible for BAL emissions. \n  * The GaugeAdder has to be updated to handle this extension as we are ready to add gauges from additional networks. The smart contracts team at Balancer Labs has deployed a coordinator contract to facilitate this upgrading.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xf354daf0ed08373938b30da9e47e8814fd8922881eb6baf6560ae34b78ceeb5b); \\[BIP-31\\] Authorize the Batch Relayer v3\n  * The functionality included in v3 is mainly intended to help with the upcoming migration of stabal3 and bb-a-USD to the soon-to-be-deployed new version of bb-a-USD. The previously known vulnerabilities are addressed in this updated bb-a-USD, which also adds new functionality like recovery mode and the capacity to charge the Aave yield the Balancer's protocol cost.\n  * The new Batch Relayer will also be able to stake and unstake on the user's behalf in the gauges. This will make it possible to complete the aforementioned migration in a single transaction (after the user has approved the Batch Relayer). Additionally, it can make claims for user rewards from gauges, creating the prospect of claim-invest-stake flows for a single transaction.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x29a37ab71ce03a5e167fd012c363e72088bd0554d2b25c99f3373fa7cceb7124); \\[BIP-32\\] Funding Proposal for Daoism Systems: PROTOCOL REVENUE SHARING FOR POOL & FACTORY CREATORS\n  * In Berlin, Daoism Systems was established in January 2022 by computer scientists, engineers, and researchers to develop on-chain solutions for web3 enterprises. \n  * The team is taking the initiative with this proposal to forge closer ties between Daoism Systems and Balancer and to contribute our skills to the expansion of Balancer's ecosystem.\n  * The author sincerely feels that implementing the revenue-sharing protocol for pool and factory designers will enhance Balancer's governance efficacy and make it more appealing for developers to build new products on top of Balancer.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x797467e0b451a49773cfea97359a32ab880caee688d16fe7db41f94a4e0570f0); \\[BIP-33\\] Orb Marketing Budget Proposal for the Remainder of Q3\n  * This proposal aims to continue Balancer marketing within the newly funded Orb Collective Service Provider (SP), under the new Operating Framework. \n  * The Orb marketing team wants to hasten Balancer Protocol's development and public exposure. The marketing demands of Balancer are ever-evolving. Each advertising campaign, product launch, or announcement is unique and designed for the occasion. Instead of semi-annually or annually, the team will ask for a budget every three months to make the biggest impact and show off Balancer's full potential. Balancer has reduced numerous expenses in order to be as lean as possible and whether the current market while it is in the middle of a bear cycle.\n  * For the remainder of Q3, a budget of $ 76,770.00 has been requested.

How could we use additional DeFi legos to bring them to the next level?\n\n## Dopex’s Interest Rate Options\n\nDopex’s new release, Curve [Interest Rate Options](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-papers-interest-rate-options-retail) (IRO), are financial derivatives where the underlying asset is the yield on any Curve liquidity pool. They’re like their TradFi [counterparts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateoptions.asp), but they’re permissionless and entirely on-chain. Like traditional options, traders have the ability to purchase existing contracts or write their own calls and puts, where the writer has complete freedom in specifying strikes, spots, expiry dates, and leverage. They are the latest addition to the Curve ecosystem and make it even more sophisticated.\n\nWhy do these work?\n\nYields on Curve pools are so unpredictable—yet so integral—to cash flow. For example, while increases in a pool’s liquidity (TVL) are always welcomed, they may dilute yields to an individual if emission allocations are held constant. Admittedly, gauge votes can solve this problem, but no gauge is ever guaranteed a larger piece of the emissions pie. Further, Curve APYs are subject to the price of Curve, which goes up or down with some correlation to the macro environment.\n\nCurve IROs normalize these externalities. With a simple [strategy](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-papers-interest-rate-options-retail), protocols and individuals can hedge against losses incurred by weaker pools, or even vote strategically to equalize information asymmetry. Curve IROs are a tool to remove some of the uncertainty from gauge votes, and where uncertainty remains, they are a tool to capitalize on it.\n\n**But IROs run deeper than just hedging.** If you want to truly unlock the full potential of IROs, a strategic combination with the Pitch meta-governance ecosystem is in order.\n\n## Vote-Incentive Strategies with Pitch\n\nLast week, we [wrote](https://mirror.xyz/0xfceEF8F8C8fF6CeD87EB8F92B972F3fCdE3230B4/DkwEnkk7MVESb2nAz2tSaBANU5Mn8LRGv45n_5HwG6E) about how the incentives economy wields the power to alter human incentive structures in DeFi governance. This week, we expand on this idea by noting the incentive economy’s ability to help participants leverage information asymmetry. This is made possible by combining Dopex’s IROs with Pitch’s incentives marketplace and staking services. Indeed, Dopex IROs can augment liquidity pool yields earned from pitched incentives and may subsidize gauge vote costs. \n\n**A simple workflow of this two-prong process illustrates our point.** \n\nSuppose Protocol A occupies 10% of the Curve emissions gauge and is seeking to gain 11%: a net 1% increase. It may turn to Pitch to incentivize veCRV holders to vote for its gauge. We may further assume that Protocol A is relatively confident in its ability to sway the gauge weight with this method, and is thus expecting higher APYs for its liquidity providers.\n\nHowever, to further boost its gains, Protocol A may buy calls on its LP yields, thus offering the protocol a dynamic settlement reward provided the option expires in the money. Protocol A is, in effect, leveraging its yields while minimizing direct exposure to large losses that come with typical leveraging. Protocol A could augment this strategy by buying puts on other gauges that it suspects will see decreased yields resulting from Protocol A’s gains.\n\nNow suppose that the epoch has ended and the option has, in fact, expired in the money. Protocol A has **increased its relative gauge weight**, **increased its yield**, **disbursed voting rewards on Pitch**, and **will enjoy the settlement rewards from the successful call option**. A converse strategy could be used to hedge this yield as well.\n\nThus, the strategic marriage between Pitch and IROs accomplished a few things. \n\n* As normal, *Protocol A* increased its gauge weight by incentivizing gauge votes in its favor using Pitch’s governance console\n* Unlike before, however, *Protocol A* safely and effectively leveraged these gains with call options, collecting settlement rewards as well.\n* And, *Protocol A* has protected itself against information asymmetry by hedging in both directions, speculating on increases in its own yield and decreases in other gauges’ yield, too. \n* Finally, by leveraging IROs with the Pitch incentives marketplace, *Protocol A* enjoys its significant advantage over other protocols vying for emissions who are pitching and earning yield conventionally. ** \n **\n\nThe use of Pitch’s vote incentives marketplace, staking services, and IROs provided *Protocol A* with previously unseen **vote-incentive strategies**. This is capital that may then be transferred to the Frax ecosystem as pitchFXS or used for further incentives on our platform, furthering the flywheel. \n\n## Why Now?\n\nWith the FRAXBP now live and new metapools surfacing weekly, there is no better time to use this strategic workflow than now. It comes at a time where risk mitigation is crucial and market intelligence is paramount. The Pitch-IRO synergy provides both of these benefits. But the benefits extend to DeFi more broadly, too.  \n\n### Advantages to All, Both Big and Small\n\nFirst, it is good for the big and small players by making the risks of information asymmetry less costly. This is particularly important for individual voters who cannot bear the costs of miscalculations due to faulty market intelligence. For larger players, it minimizes the risk of an unsuccessful incentivization campaign. For example, if *Protocol A* does not increase its Curve APY, it can hedge the loss with puts on that same pool.\n\nSecond, the Pitch-IRO symbiosis encourages more vote incentivization than seen currently. Regular pitches can become extremely costly, but by leveraging IROs with strategic incentives, protocols reduce their overall cost of pitching by increasing profitability at the end. Vote incentives increase the likelihood that a protocol receives a larger share of Curve emissions, but pairing IROs with the pitch means that protocols can hedge their losses, increasing the stability of the strategy and contributing to its longevity. \n\nPlus, the revenue stream from ITM options could entirely subsidize future pitches, meaning a protocol would not need to think twice about incentivizing with large rewards on a regular basis. \n\n### Vitalizing a New Economy\n\nIROs affect people not involved with gauge voting or their incentives at all – it creates an entirely new options economy. Anyone who holds the underlying assets—in this case, LP tokens—wields the power to sell contracts to protocols looking to augment their gauge vote yields, further intertwining the meta-governance and IRO economies.\n\nThese individuals—or even DAOs—would link two booming sectors in DeFi to spark and sustain innovation in both spaces. This would pay off immensely for all those involved. Writers earn sizable notional premiums and slashed deposit rates with generous opportunities for leverage — up to 500x. Options writing creates additional income for liquidity providers on top of the yield and boost they receive simply for providing liquidity. Using IROs in the incentives marketplace thus allows providers to exercise their LP tokens beyond lending and trading.\n\nThe Pitch-IRO symbiosis combines two existing and tested technologies to further enhance DeFi governance, letting protocols and users hedge and/or leverage their bets on the future of liquidity.\n\nHow will you be pitching next epoch?\n\n## Learn More\n\nWe’re a group of open-source contributors and actively encourage members of the community to get involved.

Source: TradingView*\n\nAs the debate about the market's direction continues to rage, here are the important levels to watch heading into the weekend, according to analysts.\n\n## Bitcoin needs weekly close above $22,800\n\nThe significance of Bitcoin trading above its 200-week MA was noted by independent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who [posted](https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1550452397213995009) the following chart highlighting the major support and resistance zones:\n\n*BTC/USDT 1-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nAccording to van de Poppe, Bitcoin is “facing crucial resistance again” at $23,500, and what happens next will determine if its price heads higher or pulls back to support at $21,500. He explained:\n\n> “If that breaks at $23.8K, I'm assuming we'll continue and then $28K is on the tables, but we also have a clear breakout above the 200-Week MA confirmed.”\n\nThe importance of BTC holding above the 200-week MA was further addressed by market analyst Rekt Capital, who highlighted the need for Bitcoin to see a weekly close above $22,800:\n\n## Anticipating a big move\n\nThe recent price action is a sign that “a big move for #BTC is going to happen soon,” according to crypto trader and pseudonymous Twitter user CryptoGodJohn, who [provided](https://twitter.com/CryptoGodJohn/status/1550489630377742337) the following chart outlining two possible paths Bitcoin could take:\n\n*BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nCryptoGodJohn said:\n\n> “Break above and hold $24,200. I think we squeeze to $27K–$28K fairly quickly. If we start accepting back into the range, I am looking for a flush down to $20K. Pretty easy invalidation on both, stay safe.”\n\n***Related: [Pro Bitcoin traders are uncomfortable with bullish positions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-bitcoin-traders-are-uncomfortable-with-bullish-positions)***\n\nThe possibility of a move in either direction was also noted by the Twitter user Mayne, who [posted](https://twitter.com/Tradermayne/status/1550330046774140929) the following chart addressing the “potential range break out” for Bitcoin.\n\n*BTC/USD 12-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nThey further explained: “Upside could be juicy if we can hold above $22.5k/range high. Lose the range high, this was likely a deviation. The move above range high becomes your risk as you target shorts back into the range.”\n\n## Keeping it simple\n\nFor those who are more inclined to accumulate and hodl as opposed to focusing on the day-to-day price movements of Bitcoin, market analyst Caleb Franzen offered the following insight to when it would be a good time to dollar-cost average:\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.048 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42%.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

This information could include your IP address, operating system, and geography.\n\nAll it takes is the creator placing an image URL in the NFT ‘s metadata that points to a machine they control that logs the request. Many web servers like Apache and NGINX can do this by default. The team at HOPR have created a series of Non-Private NFTs that show this vulnerability.\n\n> Note: this is in addition to the data a wallet like MetaMask leaks to RPC providers. You can learn more about this by checking out [DERP (Dumb Ethereum RPC Provider)](https://derp.hoprnet.org/) from the HOPR team.\n\nYou can see them generated live at their [Non-Private NFT](https://non-private-nft.hoprnet.org/) tool. They have a great post on explaining how it works and why it’s bad: [Your NFT Might be Watching You](https://medium.com/hoprnet/your-nft-might-be-watching-you-8c7ec078788f). They also have a [Non-Private NFT](https://github.com/hoprnet/non-private-nft) GitHub repo that shows how the collection could work.\n\nBelow, you can see a NFT I generated using the tool. I viewed the NFT three different ways: in my MetaMask wallet on Android, directly in Chrome, and on OpenSea.\n\n![When viewed in MetaMask on Android](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2KfGI8ulE0Q7BBJNE0fbk.png?height=900&width=600)\n\n![When viewed directly in Chrome on my laptop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0bm3nCSWYWVcLoBwuQc9L.png?height=900&width=600)\n\n![When viewed on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fbmhUMspXFlNRhjIe6ro9.png?height=900&width=600)\n\nIn the first two examples, the NFT shows my actual information. However, the OpenSea example is a different since their servers cache and serve the image. In that case, it shows the information of the AWS server OpenSea used to request the image. In each case, you can see the information is different.\n\nYou can see these NFT images generated live using HOPR’s [Non-Private NFT](https://non-private-nft.hoprnet.org/) tool. There’s a great Medium post explaining how it works and why it’s bad: [Your NFT Might be Watching You](https://medium.com/hoprnet/your-nft-might-be-watching-you-8c7ec078788f). There’s a corresponding [Non-Private NFT](https://github.com/hoprnet/non-private-nft) GitHub repo that shows how the collection could work.\n\nThis is a pretty clear case to demonstrate the need for web3 metadata privacy. Luckily, there are web3 privacy projects in the works to address this. One of which is HOPR, an incentivized mixnet enabling privacy-preserving point-to-point data exchange. It can be compared to Tor but with incentives for noderunners.

{"id": "qIWG89vJPp5DlJF25XiMFR905K3RCYxeOnYRJGn26xs", "title": "W jaki sposób nauka może pomóc odnaleźć sens życia?", "body": "## Skąd ten kryzys?\n\nWiększość z nas fantazjuje o zrobieniu czegoś, co całkowicie odmieni nasze życie. To fantazja o podjęciu odpowiedniej decyzji, założeniu biznesu czy dokonaniu rewolucyjnego odkrycia naukowego. Wolność wyboru i władza, jaką mamy nad samym sobą, jest największym skarbem ludzkości. Poczucie wolności pojawia się w momentach, w których dostrzegamy, jaką moc mają nasze czyny i jak wielką odpowiedzialność trzymamy we własnych rękach. Jesteśmy panami swojej rzeczywistości. Możemy zmienić w niej wszystko. Jednak z czasem owe uczucie wolności może stać się przekleństwem, może przybrać formę przerażenia i paniki. Wraz z możliwością wyboru pojawia się odpowiedzialność, a z odpowiedzialnością – presja i niepokój. Tylko my sami możemy obrać własną ścieżkę w życiu, ustanowić autonomiczny system wartości, zbudować spójną tożsamość. Nie możemy nikogo winić za obranie niewłaściwego kierunku.\n\nWewnętrzne konflikty, poczucie pustki i lęku związane z celowością życia często prowadzą do kryzysów emocjonalno-egzystencjalnych. Taki rodzaj stresu zmusza jednostkę do aktywacji różnych mechanizmów obronnych. Powrót do „normalności” wymaga ponownej oceny sposobów myślenia i działania, co wiąże się ze zmianą tożsamości. Aby zapobiec przerażającej wizji transformacji, uciekamy w pustkę, stan „nie-bycia”. Wybieramy zautomatyzowane życie pozbawione refleksji. Zaprzestajemy używania świadomego rozumu, inaczej: systemu drugiego. Utrwala się modularność globalnej sieci roboczej, promując kompulsywne zachowania. Taki wybór ma zapobiec utracie energii życiowej oraz spowodować ucieczkę od dyskomfortu odczuwanego przy wykonywaniu złożonych zadań. Zamiast wymagającej poznawczo eksploracji, nieustannie eksploatujemy dobrze nam znaną rzeczywistość, korzystając z automatycznego i nieświadomego systemu pierwszego. Większość podejmowanych działań jest obarczona błędami poznawczymi (cognitive bias) – nieracjonalnymi wzorcami postrzegania świata, opartymi na pozarozumowej wiedzy. Gdy przestajemy używać rozumu, oddajemy swoją wolność. A z pewnością znajdzie się ktoś, kto chętnie nam tę wolność odbierze, dając w zamian poczucie złudnego bezpieczeństwa. \n\nŻyjemy w czasach, w których promowane są konsumpcjonizm i natychmiastowa gratyfikacja. Niekończący się wyścig szczurów ciągle trwa i zbiera żniwo. Zatracamy własną tożsamość w pogoni za karierą, wpadając w nowe choroby psychiczne związane z kryzysem egzystencji. Z pomocą przychodzi medycyna, która (z reguły) nie bada źródeł zaburzeń psychicznych, zwalcza jedynie objawy choroby, ordynując standardowy zestaw leków, których przyjmowanie często wiąże się z przykrymi efektami ubocznymi. Neuroleptyki czy leki z grupy SxRI mogą „spłaszczać” odczuwane emocje, powodować nadwagę i spadki libido. Spółki farmaceutyczne przygotowały również wspaniałe remedium dla ludzi ciężko chorych, wymagających szczególnej opieki. W aptekach znajdziemy cały arsenał leków mających właściwości narkotyzujące, które mogą silnie uzależniać zarówno psychicznie i fizycznie. Jeżeli pacjent nie odbędzie skutecznej terapii psychologicznej, to po odstawieniu leków choroba bardzo często powraca. Postępująca medykalizacja nie jest zjawiskiem budzącym większej kontrowersji w przestrzeni publicznej. Dostajemy natychmiastowe i skuteczne rozwiązanie kryzysów życiowych w postaci garści tabletek. I to jest super wygodne. \n\nTaki wypaczony styl życia jest promowany przez media, które są wykorzystywane przez polityków, firmy, korporacje, osoby publiczne i prywatne do osiągnięcia różnych celów: ekonomicznych, propagandowych lub nawet czysto dezinformacyjnych. Irracjonalność staje się narzędziem marketingowym. Media kształtują odruchowe postawy odbiorców w taki sposób, by poszukiwali oni przede wszystkim stymulacji emocjonalnej, a także wybierali formy proste, atrakcyjne i niewymagające wysiłku poznawczego. Emocje i szok są wykorzystywane do przyciągania uwagi. Panuje ogólny nadmiar treści i każdy te treści może redystrybuować – niezależnie od tego, czy są zgodne z prawdą, czy nie. Autorytetami dla społeczeństwa stają się influencerzy z social mediów. Podążanie własną ścieżką jest podkopywane autodestrukcyjnymi zachowaniami. \n\nKonstruowanie przekazów skłaniających do biernego, posłusznego odbioru sprawia, że ludzie w żaden sposób nie chcą weryfikować przekonań ani wchodzić w dyskusję, tylko przyjmują przekaz jako prawdę. Niestety już od najmłodszych lat życia człowieka wpaja się mu, że posłuszny i bezkrytyczny odbiór informacji przekazywany przez osoby przedstawiane jako autorytatywne to coś słusznego. Umiera kreatywność i sceptyczne podejście do przyjmowania informacji. Opinia „specjalistów” w kitlu całkowicie może wpłynąć na podejmowane decyzje i kształtowane opinie. Co gorsza, niektórzy ludzie są w stanie bezgranicznie uwierzyć w słowa „specjalistów” w sutannach, strojach rytualnych czy jeszcze innych szatach czarnoksiężników. Ale dzięki temu nie trzeba szukać trudnych rozwiązań na skomplikowane problemy. A to jest super łatwe i przyjemne. \n\nNasz brak umiejętności realizacji swoich celów prowadzi do uciekania się w fikcję i nieprawdopodobne konstrukcje myślowe, byle tylko utrzymać ego w komfortowej pozycji. Błędne rozumienie świata może powodować w życiu ludzi niebezpieczne sytuacje i rozpowszechnianie irracjonalności, stąd już mały krok do zatracenia osobistej wolności i sensu życiowego.\n\n## Kognitywistyka jako emergentny, wielopoziomowy opis rzeczywistości\n\nPoczątkowo, w czasach starożytnych, poszukiwaniem odpowiedzi, które miały prowadzić do zrozumienia świata, zajmowali się filozofowie. Filozofia jest często ujmowana jako metadyscyplina – najbardziej ogólna z dziedzin wiedzy, wyznaczająca ich podstawy metodologiczne i warunki funkcjonowania (w starożytności nie było podziału między filozofią a nauką). Filozofia rozumiana jako nauka stawia sobie za zadanie prawdziwe poznanie danego przedmiotu. Z tak rozumianej filozofii wywodzą się współczesne szczegółowe dyscypliny naukowe. Pojęcie filozofii oznacza szeroko rozumianą ciekawość intelektualną i poszukiwanie wiedzy. Już od czasów starożytności ludzie próbowali zrozumieć prawa opisujące świat rzeczywisty i złożoność ludzkiego gatunku. Co istnieje? Co mogę wiedzieć? Co mogę zrozumieć? \n\nW odpowiedzi na współczesne pytania związane z funkcjonowaniem umysłu powstała nowa dziedzina nauki: kognitywistyka. Jej głównym wyzwaniem jest integracja wiedzy, znalezienie „mostu” łączącego różne paradygmaty opisu ludzkiego umysłu . Kognitywistyka czerpie m.in. z antropologii, psychologii, lingwistyki, neuronauk. Wykorzystuje również uczenie maszynowe i algorytmiczną teorię grafów. Każda z wymienionych dziedzin wykorzystuje różną metodologię i posiada własną terminologię. Nauki kognitywne badają podobieństwa zachodzące między integrowanymi dziedzinami, jednocześnie zachowując spójną metodologię, której ramy konceptualne są wyznaczane dzięki dyskursowi filozoficznemu. \n\nZarówno zagadki nauk kognitywnych, jak i złożone problemy życiowe wymagają myślenia, dzięki któremu możemy znaleźć rozwiązanie. To myślenie to przekształcenia dokonywane na umysłowych reprezentacjach świata. W tym sensie myślenie zastępuje działanie - pozwala na symulowanie wydarzeń rozgrywających się w świecie realnym, bez negatywnych, ale i pozytywnych konsekwencji typowych dla rzeczywistego zachowania. Myślenie jest jednym z narzędzi budowania modeli mentalnych i opisów rzeczywistości zawierających m.in alternatywne wersje wydarzeń, które mogłyby być skutkiem podjęcia określonych działań. \n\nWykonywanie czynności angażujących poznawczo, w tym konstruowanie wspomnianych symulacji mentalnych, mocno integruje sieć funkcjonalną mózgu. Jest to proces przyswajania nowych informacji. Powtarzając systematycznie określone działanie, sieć w stanie segregacji (spoczynku) zwiększa modularność sieci, dzięki czemu „zapisujemy” naszą skonstruowaną reprezentację, a jej przywołanie w przyszłości nie będzie wymagało ponawiania kosztownej integracji sieci. \n\nTworząc nowe pojęcia, prowadząc badania, szukamy złożonych wzorów, które pomagają nam opisać rzeczywistość w nowy sposób. Kognitywistyka poszukuje interakcji i podobieństw w różnych opisach funkcjonowania ludzkiego umysłu. Im więcej takich modeli i im bardziej przystają one do rzeczywistości, tym większe jest prawdopodobieństwo podjęcia optymalnego działania prowadzącego do zmiany paradygmatu. Naukę (w bardzo uproszczony sposób) można opisać jako nieustanny proces konstruowania wzorów lub pojęć (output_1) wyprowadzanych z istniejących już danych (input_1). Następnie nasz (output_1) staje się (inputem_2), z którego wyprowadzamy (output_2) itd. Jest to również powtarzający się cykl integracji-segregacji sieci naszego mózgu. Z mniejszych systemów pojęć i koncepcji wyłaniają się nowe, znaczące patterny, które pomagają nam w głębszym zrozumieniu rzeczywistości. \n\nZgodnie z ujęciem emergencji w trakcie rozwoju świata powstają raptownie i nieprzewidywalnie nowe jakości o coraz większym stopniu organizacji, tworzące hierarchiczny układ. Wyższe jakości wyłaniają się z niższych, jednak nie dają się do nich sprowadzić, gdyż posiadają swoiste cechy. Zjawiska emergentne powstają po osiągnięciu przez system pewnego progu złożoności, powiązań lub organizacji. Pozwala to tłumaczyć takie zjawiska, jak inteligencja. Może ona wynikać z oddziaływania pomiędzy bardzo wieloma prostymi neuronami. \n\nŚwiat widziany z naukowej i filozoficznej perspektywy jest hierarchicznie ustrukturyzowany. Procesy prowadzące do powstania złożonych, samoorganizujących się układów hierarchicznych (fizycznych, chemicznych, neuronalnych, biologicznych) generowane są przez ewolucyjne zasady samoorganizacji. Na różnych poziomach spotykamy różne rodzaje prawidłowości i relacji przyczynowo-skutkowych. To samo dotyczy własności umysłowych człowieka. Nie pojawiają się one znikąd, lecz powstają w długotrwałym procesie ewolucyjnym. Zrozumienie natury relacji między mózgiem a poszczególnymi funkcjami umysłowymi nie jest możliwe bez uwzględnienia ewolucji i zasad działania samego mózgu. \n\nEmergentne spojrzenie na mózg jako sieć interakcji może przyczynić się do lepszego zrozumienia naszych umysłów, a w rezultacie – otaczającej nas rzeczywistości. Zrozumienie jest dobrą podstawą do kultywowania mądrości i racjonalności.\n\n## Psychotechnologie i nauka jako antykryzysowe tarcze\n\nPodczas procesu „wybudzania się” z kryzysu znaczeniowego, opisywanego przez Johna Vervaeke, podkreśla on kluczowość wykorzystywania psychotechnologii: zinternalizowanych sposobów na zapisywanie, przetwarzanie informacji a także poszerzanie zasobów poznawczych. To właśnie dzięki wykorzystaniu psychotechnologii, jak umiejętność pisania, czytania, liczenia, posługiwania się symbolami, możemy zapisywać, przekazywać i korygować nasze procesy myślowe. Stajemy się bardziej świadomi swoich procesów mentalnych. Dzięki wynalezieniu pisma mamy dostęp do skumulowanej wiedzy przekazywanej z pokolenia na pokolenie. Możemy wytwarzać ulepszone narzędzia i technologie, które pozwalają nam na pogłębienie naszej wiedzy dotyczącej rzeczywistości i natury umysłu. Ludzkość staje się mądrzejsza i może polegać na naukowym, racjonalnym opisie świata, który nadaje wiarygodność nowym odkryciom. Rozwija się racjonalność, czyli zdolność do wykorzystywania zgromadzonych informacji do osiągania celów. \n\nJedną z psychotechnologii, która powstała w celu przezwyciężenia kryzysu pustki życiowej, jest vipassana: buddyjska medytacja wglądu, esencja nauk Buddy. Dzięki utrzymywaniu świadomości na wewnętrznych doznaniach cielesnych doświadczamy zjawiska „wglądu” (insight). Podczas praktyki vipassany zmniejsza się aktywność naszej domyślnej sieci roboczej. \n\nOdmiennym sposobem poszerzania swojego „cognitive capacity” jest praktyka kontemplacji, która może być porównywana do zjawiska „mind-wandering”. W przeciwieństwie do vipassany skupia się ona na eksternalizacji naszych myśli, „wychodzeniu” do otaczającego świata i spontanicznym oglądzie rzeczywistości. Nie jest to myślenie ukierunkowane na konkretny cel. Podczas praktyki kontemplacji zwiększa się aktywność sieci domyślnej. Może to prowadzić do spontanicznej integracji niektórych sieci, co będzie ułatwiało nam „przestawianie się” na myślenie zorientowane na konkretnym celu i zwiększało kontrolę nad procesami myślowymi. \n\nUmiejętność aktywnego przełączania się między segregacją i integracją jest nazywana stanem flow – stanem całkowitego skupienia na jakiejś czynności, pozytywnym zatraceniu się w chwili obecnej. Stan flow może być odmiennym, wyższym stanem świadomości, bliskim transcendencji, w którym istnienie przedmiotu poznania jest poza umysłem poznającym. \n\nStan flow kojarzy mi się z psychodelicznymi doświadczeniami, podczas których sieć się integruje i segreguje jednocześnie. Istotna staje się wówczs tylko chwila teraźniejsza i nasze wewnętrzne doznania. Jednocześnie wychodzenie myślami poza własną egzystencję jest bardzo proste, wręcz domyślne. Psychodeliczne doświadczenie to tymczasowy stan, który stawia przed nami wyzwanie radykalnej transformacji. Przebywając tu i teraz, możemy rozmyślać nad złożonością rzeczywistości (kompromis między integracją a segregacją sieci). Czasem nie musimy używać kontroli poznawczej, czasem działamy jakby zaprogramowani przez „wyższą świadomość”. Przykładowo: nie potrzebujemy kontroli poznawczej, żeby powstrzymać się przed spożyciem przetworzonego jedzenia, tak jakby wgrano nam wzorzec, który domyślnie „rozumie”, że nie jest to odpowiedni pokarm dla „przebudzonego człowieka” (choć w rzeczywistości lubię smak czipsów). Ale chwila: można przecież powiedzieć: „Nie potrzebuję żadnych substancji psychoaktywnych, by wiedzieć, że czipsy są niezdrowe”. Jednak przebywanie w stanie odmiennej świadomości sprawia, że nasz wgląd jest przytłaczająco oczywisty, dzięki czemu wywiera głębszy wpływ na różne sfery egzystencji (w tym przypadku na wybór odpowiedniego sposobu odżywiania się). \n\nCelem stosowania różnych psychotechnologii, szukania odmiennych stanów świadomości i wglądu jest poznanie samego siebie oraz wykształcenie umiejętności określenia tego, co nam się podoba i czego pragniemy. To dzięki „większej” przestrzeni i otwartości umysłu jesteśmy w stanie odszukiwać, formułować i rozwiązywać nowe problemy. Nabywamy umiejętności do wyszukiwania wartościowych informacji, dzięki którym rozumiemy świat (i samych siebie) w bardziej wysublimowany sposób. Zaczynamy dostrzegać wielowymiarowość pewnych aspektów rzeczywistości. Zdobywamy rozsądek i „wewnętrzną mądrość” – zaczynamy rozumieć, co nas unosi, a co ciągnie na dno. \n\nAby dotrzeć do celu, powinniśmy nauczyć się również cierpliwości. To doświadczenie, które płynie z przeżyć i rozczarowań, czyni nas silniejszymi. Nie jest ono stałym punktem, lecz drogą, która kształtuje nasz los. Liczy się to, by nie powtarzać identycznych błędów, obejmować porażki świadomością i stale się rozwijać. Przekraczać własne granice, by stać się tym, kim naprawdę chce się być. Prawdopodobnie tworzenie lepszej przyszłości jest sensem życia. Racjonalny świat nauki powinien pomóc odkryć ten sens każdemu, kto jeszcze go nie znalazł. Tego właśnie życzę nam wszystkim.", "timestamp": 1658535177, "digest": "10t2cCqHf-fWn3rZf05EXc__JHDTliodMWc0Zj2HALo", "contributor": "0x58134e52A6cd119b46F62c4f6612Df56e9ad8E8f"}

Media报道，韩国科技巨头Hancom旗下加密子公司Arowana Hub推出的加密项目遭遇诉讼，Arowana Coin代币投资者面临大规模亏损风险。首尔中央地方法院6日接受了对Arowana Coin投资的普通投资者的债权临时扣押申请。因此，钱包管理人Hexlant保管的Arowana基金会所有的4.3亿多枚Arowana Coin被临时扣押，在诉讼结束之前这些代币禁止移动。普通投资者索赔的损失金额为800亿韩元（约合6089万美元）。如果投资者赢了，法院最多可以将5000万枚Arowana Coin代币在不锁仓的情况下转给投资者，并允许投资者在交易所出售。\n\n此前，投资者与Hancom签订了5000万枚Arowana Coin投资合同，并支付了这笔钱。Hancom曾承诺将在2021年代币上线交易所后将这些代币转移至投资者的钱包中，但并未兑现。Arowana Coin于2021年上线Bithumb交易所后，立即暴涨超1000%。投资人声称，就算是按照Arowana Coin最低价计算，损失金额也达到了1156亿韩元（约合8799万美元）。而投资者与Hancom的代币投资合同发生纠纷，Bithumb对此未进行披露，被质疑没有对投资者采取保护措施。据悉，Arowana (ARW) 项目是一个处理黄金等实物资产价值的区块链平台，有人怀疑金Arowana Coin被用于为Hancom董事长金相哲筹集行贿资金，调查仍在进行中。Hancom公司随后对法院扣押资金一事提出异议，称申请临时扣押的投资者与Aronawa Hub没有债务关系。\n\n[英国《金融时报》推出加密金融板块](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/p80uo24n.html)\n\n据FinanceFeeds报道，英国《金融时报》推出了Cryptofinance板块，这是一个集合加密货币报道的新的数字中心和每周通讯，旨在揭示数字资产行业以及创新如何影响主流金融。\n\n[外媒：美国SEC官员回应称SEC尚未就BNB向币安发出传票](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/tu83e2yt.html)\n\n加密媒体CoinDesk根据《信息自由法》向SEC提交了一份“SEC就调查BNB代币向币安发出的传票”的请求被退回，但一位SEC官员在回复中写道：“根据你在信中提供的信息，我们对SEC的各种记录系统进行了彻底搜索，但没有找到或识别任何响应你请求的信息。”据悉，彭博社曾于6月份报道，美国SEC正在调查BNB代币是否为未注册的证券，对此赵长鹏回应币安就其产品与当局保持定期联系，并否认该公司已被传唤。\n\n[三箭资本创始人Su

Zhu在接受电话采访时表示：“一直躲藏且没有出席近期的一系列法庭活动是因为受到了死亡威胁，但这并不意味着我们没有与所有相关部门进行沟通，在事发后我们一直有保持联系。”两人拒绝透露他们在哪里，但电话中的一位律师表示，他们的最终目的地是阿拉伯联合酋长国。\n\n此外，Su Zhu和Kyle Davies描述了风险管理的系统性失败，宽松的流动信贷加剧了错误押注的影响。他们承认其失败为行业其他人引发的连锁反应造成了损失，但强调他们也遭受了巨大的损失，并对此感到懊悔，同时也否认了他们在危机爆发前从三箭资本撤资的指控。Su Zhu还表示，他们未预料到LUNA能在几天内跌至归零，并引发整个行业的信贷紧缩，从而对三箭所有流动性不足的头寸造成巨大压力。尽管如此，该基金仍能够继续从大型数字资产贷方和富有的投资者那里借款，直到这些机构本身陷入危机。在LUNA崩盘后，Su Zhu表示贷方对三箭资本的财务状况“感到满意”，并允许他们继续交易。\n\n对于外界质疑其“奢靡”的生活，Su Zhu表示：“此前传闻的破产之际支付5000万美元首付买游艇的消息不实，那艘游艇是1年前委托建造的，并且有完整的资金来源。我每天骑自行车上下班，和我的家人在新加坡只有两个家。出问题时总有人喜欢写出这样的新闻。”在回答有关该公司哪里出了问题时，Su Zhu提到了多年牛市带来的过度自信，牛市不仅注入了他和Davies的思维力，还注入了几乎所有的行业信贷基础设施，在这些领域，因为有像他这样的融资公司，贷方看到了他们的价值膨胀。\n\n[BlockFi第二季度透明度报告：有18亿美元未偿贷款，已制定流动性指导方案](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/h1584h4x.html)\n\n据Cointelegraph报道，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，截至第二季度末，公司拥有来自机构和散户投资者的18亿美元未偿贷款，其中6亿美元是无抵押贷款。机构贷款占未偿贷款总额的15亿美元，而散户贷款占剩余的3亿美元。\n\nBlockFi表示已经制定指导方案，以帮助其保持必要的流动性来履行核心业务活动，包括机构和零售借贷和交易活动。该指导方案将根据客户的需求在库存中持有至少10%的总金额，并准备好退还给客户。还将在可在7天内收回并返还给客户的地方持有至少50%的欠款，并将根据需要将欠客户总额的至少90%用于存货或可偿还的贷款中。这类贷款将在一年内召回。\n\n[Coinbase发布二季度投资备忘录，Web

V3正式部署至Celo网络，Celo也为自己的生态吸引到了影响力最大的项目。借助于Uniswap的深度、无许可性以及集中流动性架构，Celo将在其上构建与碳信用代币相关的流动性池，以提升碳市场的资本流动性，同时也为其他协议在Celo上整合碳信用打下基础，第一个流动性池将是Moss碳信用代币池CELO/MCO2。\n\n与很多面向所有市场的Layer1的公链不同，Celo定位是一条主打去中心化移动支付的区块链网络，其主网于2020年4月正式上线，旨在让全球没有银行账户的用户也能够通过手机等移动设备享受DeFi产品所带来的便利性，所以非洲和诸多欠发达国家是其市场重点。除了采用PoS共识机制、兼容EVM、具有跨链互操作性外，其特点还包括以稳定币作为汇款、跨境支付等交易媒介、支持多种代币支付Gas费、将电话号码映射到钱包地址以简化转账操作等。2021年4月，欧洲最大的电信运营商德国电信公司宣布对Celo进行投资，此前的投资机构还包括a16z、Coinbase Ventures、Electric Capital、Jack Dorsey等。\n\n除了推动去中心化金融的发展外，Celo还致力于为环保事业做出贡献，此次和Uniswap“结盟”也是为了共同推进ReFi（Regenerative Finance）的发展。顾名思义，ReFi指的是可再生金融，旨在通过Web3技术扭转气候变化，即利用区块链技术的透明机制，将现实中的自然资产引入链上，同时引入激励机制，对绿色发展作出贡献的行为进行奖励，以推动可持续性发展。据Celo基金会估计，ReFi将是一个万亿规模的经济市场，目前最常见的ReFi项目就是碳信用代币化类，比如Toucan、Flow Carbon和Moss等，Celo也与上述项目建立了合作关系，而碳信用代币的流动性问题是当下面临的挑战之一，此次Celo与Uniswap的合作也是为了提升该市场的资本效率。ReFi是一个全新叙事，PANews也对其进行了深度解读[“万字长文解读ReFi：全新的Web3叙事范式，可编程的经济循环”](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/0wbr3ltq.html)。\n\n据PANews统计，目前

{"id": "rD23dT3adYbMpSGK8QNDIPI350WuauchVe9Hqca-hT0", "title": "Building a Stable Platform", "body": "As the dust has begun to (hopefully) settle on the crypto crash, people have begun sorting through the rubble to figure out which products from this last cycle were useful and real, and which were hypes and ponzis. I’ve thrown my hat into this ring too many times, including two pieces on web3 use cases: Today and in the Future.\n\nOne category that seems to be unanimously viewed as useful, outside of the most skeptical skeptics, is stablecoins. It’s one of the use cases I highlighted a month ago. And among the stablecoins, the consensus seems to be that USDC is the stablest of them all.\n\nStablecoins are sneakily fascinating because they’re both a digital currency and a sort of platform on top of which new applications can be built, or old ones improved. But to achieve that promise, they need to actually be stable. A dollar-denominated stablecoin, like USDC, needs to be redeemable for a good ol’ fashioned US Dollar, every time, everywhere.\n\nIf a stablecoin can be trusted to perform that foundational obligation, then developers can begin to build financial products on modern digital rails. Sometimes, they’ll build entirely new applications, like DeFi protocols. Others, they’ll rip out pieces of old, creaky financial infrastructure and replace them with newer rails.\n\nThe revolution does not need to be total to be impactful. Circle is a case study in compromise. It’s a centralized company facilitating the growth of a decentralized financial system. It’s used by web2, web3, and web2.5 companies alike. It’s happy to sit in the background, facilitating fast, cheap, global payments and loans while others build shiny interfaces and sturdy guardrails on top.\n\nAfter seeing USDC’s outperformance during the bear market – its market cap has grown as the overall market has shrunk – and seeing a lot of people I respect point to USDC as a gold standard, I decided to team up with Circle to tell the story via a Sponsored Deep Dive. You can read more about how I choose which companies to work with on Sponsored Deep Dives here. In this case, I realized that I didn’t know nearly as much about stablecoins as I should, and I was pumped that they were willing to work with me to help understand and then explain.\n\nAs always: this is not financial or investment advice. I’m an idiot, and I’m learning as I go – you would be foolish to allocate your cash based on anything I write. Do your own research. But I hope that it’s an entertaining and informative look into one of crypto’s key building blocks.\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\nCircle & USDC: Building a Stable Platform\n(Click the link to read the full thing online)\n\nYes, I know. This newsletter is called Not Boring. But I’m going to start this essay off by showing you the Most Boring Chart in All of Crypto.\n\nCoinMarketCap\nThat’s the 1 year price chart of USD Coin (“USDC”), the fiat-backed, fully-collateralized, dollar-denominated stablecoin issued by Circle. I dare you to find me a more boring chart.\n\nFor the entire past year, as prices of other crypto assets rollercoastered up and down and up and very down, USDC hugged the $1 line tightly. 🥱\n\nFor stablecoins, boring is good. Boring is the goal. And being the most boring stablecoin results in a chart that isn’t very boring at all:\n\nCoinMarketCap (Click “Market Cap” on the Chart)\nThat’s USDC’s market cap since its inception in October 2018, which represents the total USDC in circulation. At the time of writing, July 20th, 2022, that number stands at $54.8 billion. Circulating USDC has more than doubled in the past year, after growing 25x between July 2020 and July 2021. Since its price is pegged to $1, increases in market cap mean that there’s more usage of USDC (the inverse is also true – the market cap declines when people redeem their USDC for Dollars).\n\nBoring is a feature, not a bug. It’s key to Circle’s first product value proposition – digital dollars – and it’s key to Circle’s mission: To raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value.\n\nIf you’ve heard of Circle, it’s likely because of USDC. That’s the company’s first killer product. Recently, it announced that it’s launching a second, Euro Coin (EUROC).\n\nBut thinking about USDC and EUROC as just stablecoins misses the company’s ambitions to become:\n\nThe platform on top of which developers build a new financial system\n\nThe digital currency of choice institutional investors leverage for trading and settlement\n\nA tool that enables the frictionless, borderless exchange of value\n\nIt’s an ambitious bet in a competitive space, and one dogged by both valid and invalid concerns, many of which we’ll cover in this piece. Circle is trying to differentiate on trust, the necessary foundation for its ambitions. Increasingly, it seems to be working.\n\nI didn’t give much thought to stablecoins until Luna’s UST blew up a couple of months ago. But as I’ve dug in, I’ve realized that they’re one of the most solid use cases in web3 today, and a fundamental building block in the much bigger visions entrepreneurs in the space are building towards. Once the idea of programmable, permissionless money worms into your brain, it’s hard to see where stablecoins wouldn’t provide an improvement over the status quo.\n\nBut let’s start with the basics and build up from there:\n\nWhat are stablecoins?\n\nHow do stablecoin issuers generate revenue?\n\nWhy are stablecoins a valuable primitive?\n\nHow are USDC and Circle a platform?\n\nWhat is Circle’s competitive advantage?\n\nWhat would a new financial system built on Circle’s rails look like?\n\nWhat Are Stablecoins?\nIf you’ve followed the crypto markets recently, you might’ve heard the word “stablecoin” and chuckled. “Stablecoin, huh?” you’d quip, “Not very … stable 😂.” It’s a funny joke.\n\nCoinMarketCap\nIn May, UST (Terra’s stablecoin) lost its peg to the dollar (translation: it became worth less than $1). It flushed hard, bringing the entire Luna ecosystem down with it. Ultimately, it brought down crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (“3AC”) which contributed to the downfall of Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and other Centralized Finance (“CeFi”) lenders. Friend of the newsletter Jon Wu wrote a great thread / Not Boring essay on Terra-Luna and UST, and Arthur Hayes wrote the definitive piece on the 3AC collapse in case you want to read more gory details.\n\nThe UST situation brought to light something that was apparent to anyone who dug into the math or simply walked through the logic: not all stablecoins are created equal. Not all stablecoins are … stable.\n\nThe goal of a stablecoin is to stay pegged to its reference asset. For most stablecoins, that’s the US Dollar. So one (1) USD stablecoin – like USDC – should be worth $1. As Alex Danco wrote in 2018:\n\nThe crucial test that any stablecoin must pass for the market to actually trust it is: if a user wants to redeem their stablecoins for genuine dollars, under any reasonable circumstance, can they do so?\n\n“Reasonable” is doing a lot of work here. People should always be able to redeem their stablecoins for genuine dollars. There are three main models stablecoin issuers pursue to make that happen:\n\nFiat-Backed\n\nCryptocurrency-Backed\n\nAlgorithmic\n\nWe’ll start last, first. Algorithmic stablecoins, like UST, aren’t backed by dollars, a basket of cryptos, commodities, or anything, really, outside of what they create themselves.\n\nInstead of explaining this insanity myself, I’ll turn it over to the inimitable Matt Levine:\n\nHere is how an algorithmic stablecoin works:\n\nYou wake up one morning and invent two crypto tokens.\n\nOne of them is the stablecoin, which I will call “Terra,” for reasons that will become apparent.\n\nThe other one is not the stablecoin. I will call it “Luna.”\n\nTo be clear, they are both just things you made up, just numbers on a ledger. (Probably the ledger is maintained on a decentralized blockchain, though in theory you could do this on your computer in Excel.)\n\nYou try to find people to buy them.\n\nLuna will trade at some price determined by supply and demand. If you make it up on your computer and keep the list in Excel and smirk when you tell people about this, that price will be zero, and none of this will work.\n\nBut if you do a good job of marketing Luna, that price will not be zero. If the price is not zero then you’re in business.\n\nYou promise that people can always exchange one Terra for $1 worth of Luna. If Luna trades at $0.10, then one Terra will get you 10 Luna. If Luna trades at $20, then one Terra will get you 0.05 Luna. Doesn’t matter. The price of Luna is arbitrary, but one Terra always gets you $1 worth of Luna. (And vice versa: People can always exchange $1 worth of Luna for one Terra.)\n\nYou set up an automated smart contract — the “algorithm” in “algorithmic stablecoin” — to let people exchange their Terras for Lunas and Lunas for Terras.\n\nTerra should trade at $1. If it trades above $1, people — arbitrageurs — can buy $1 worth of Luna for $1 and exchange them for one Terra worth more than a dollar, for an instant profit. If it trades below $1, people can buy one Terra for less than a dollar and exchange it for $1 worth of Luna, for an instant profit. These arbitrage trades push the price of Terra back to $1 if it ever goes higher or lower.\n\nThe price of Luna will fluctuate. Over time, as trust in this ecosystem grows, it will probably mostly go up. But that is not essential to the stablecoin concept. As long as Luna robustly has a non-zero value, you can exchange one Terra for some quantity of Luna that is worth $1, which means Terra should be worth $1, which means that its value should be stable.\n\n“All of this is,” Levine writes, “quite straightforward and correct, except for Point 7, which is insane.” $UST and $LUNA rose in tandem, and they fell in tandem.\n\nAfter UST’s collapse, the market for algorithmic stablecoins will likely be muted for a long time, so we don’t need to spend more time here.\n\nCryptocurrency-backed stablecoins are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies and are typically overcollateralized, meaning that the dollar value of cryptocurrencies in the reserve exceeds the dollar value of stablecoins outstanding. They achieve this by requiring each user to deposit more in another token, like ETH or BTC, than they pull out in stablecoin.\n\nThe leading example here is MakerDAO’s stablecoin, DAI, with a $7.2 billion market cap.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nA user who wants to take out a loan opens a Vault by sending ERC-20 tokens like ETH, Wrapped BTC, and USDC to the smart contract and receives DAI in return.\n\nDAI borrowing is overcollateralized, meaning that you need to put in a higher dollar value in your ERC-20 token of choice than you take out in DAI, with higher collateral ratios depending on the volatility and liquidity of the token you deposit. Currently, ETH has a minimum collateral ratio of 170%, Wrapped BTC of 175%, and Staked ETH of 185%.\n\nAt any time, you can deposit your DAI back in and unlock the ERC-20 you’d locked up.\n\nIf, however, the price of your ERC-20 of choice drops to a point that breaks the minimum collateral ratio, Maker will liquidate you, or sell your tokens.\n\nThe disadvantage of borrowing DAI is that you need to put up a lot of collateral – currently, to borrow DAI with ETH requires a minimum collateral ratio of 170%, meaning I’d need to put in at least $17,000 worth of ETH to get 10,000 DAI. I also have to pay a Variable Annual Fee, currently at 0.50% for ETH deposits.\n\nOasis App\nPlus, if the price of ETH drops to a point that breaks that ratio – in this case, if it drops even one cent – the smart contract liquidates me by selling the ETH. That could mean that you might be forced to sell at an inopportune time.\n\nThe advantage of DAI to the borrower is that it’s completely on-chain, without the need for a centralized intermediary, and works well with your existing crypto holdings. If you want to hold onto your ETH but take out a little walking around money, you can just lock up the ETH, get DAI, and use it for any of the things you might use stablecoins for.\n\nThe advantage of DAI as a protocol is that, by being overcollateralized and liquidating below certain thresholds, it can maintain stability and keep the promise that users can redeem their DAI for their ERC-20 tokens in any reasonable scenario.\n\nAs a result, even during the recent turmoil, DAI has held up well. DAI’s chart isn’t quite as boring as USDC’s, but it’s pretty boring:\n\nCoinMarketCap\nAt the time of writing, it’s trading at around $1.00, as designed.\n\nThere are other crypto-backed stablecoins that are pegged to the dollar, with more launching regularly, others pegged to assets besides the US Dollar, and others still that aren’t pegged to anything at all. Some just want to be reserve currencies themselves. OlympusDAO, for example, has a mix of tokens in its reserve, backing its “Future Decentralized Reserve Currency,” Ohm. If you’ve seen the (3,3) or (something, something) meme on Twitter, that comes from the game theory behind Ohm, that it’s better for everyone if everyone just stakes their Ohm and holds. Ohm has had a bumpy ride, falling from a peak of $420 to a current price of $52.\n\nThere are other promising crypto reserve currency projects, all vying to build an internet-native reserve that isn’t tied to the value of any fiat currency, but they’re different than stablecoins and outside the scope of this piece.\n\nThat brings us to fiat-backed stablecoins, like USDC.\n\nCircle’s USDC stablecoin is the most straightforward of the major stablecoins: for every dollar of USDC in circulation, Circle holds $1 worth of straight cash and US Treasury Bills, for which there is the deepest and most liquid market of any asset in the world.\n\nTwitter avatar for @WatcherGuru\nWatcher.Guru\n@WatcherGuru\nJUST IN: Circle says they hold 80% of their $USDC reserves in US Treasury bills and 20% in cash within the US banking system.\nJuly 5th 2022\n\n453 Retweets3,505 Likes\nIf you want to redeem 1 USDC for $1, no magic needs to happen. The dollar is sitting there, either right in the USDC reserve bank accounts at BNY Mellon and other large banks, or invested in short-term Treasuries that are easier than anything else in the world to exchange into dollars. Circle posts weekly reporting and monthly attestations on its website:\n\nCircle\nIn a recent interview, Circle CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen said that Circle’s customers “could redeem all of USDC in one day. We could process those redemptions, and the only limits to the time that they would get their U.S. dollars back are the limits in the settlement systems of the fiat currency banking system itself.”\n\nSome people – from pseudonymous Twitter accounts with 12 followers to journalist Matt Taibbi – have expressed concerns about Circle and USDC, ranging from the idea that centralized institutions cannot be trusted to issues with the structure of its agreement with BlackRock around the Circle Reserve Fund. The concerns boil down to whether or not there will always be a US Dollar available when a customer wants to redeem a USDC, which breaks down into whether Circle holds its reserve in the assets it says it does (Cash and short-term Treasuries) and whether Circle’s business operations and USDC reserves are separate.\n\nMany of these claims seem to stem from a misunderstanding of how USDC works, how reserves are held today, and the differences between USDC and Circle itself.\n\nAddressing the first point, whether Circle holds what it says it does, and where, and what exactly it holds, Circle has been very transparent with its holdings. In the past, it has held commercial paper, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Yankee CDs, but in September 2021, it moved all of its USDC reserves into cash and cash equivalents, per the 2021 Circle Examination Report by Grant Thornton.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the growth of stablecoins “has rightly brought significant federal regulatory attention” and that it would hold all USDC reserves in cash and short-duration US government treasuries “given our commitment to maintaining high standards, which in some cases go beyond those required by our regulators.”\n\nIn addition to monthly attestations and the annual audit, last week, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted a CUSIP-level breakdown of the reserve’s T-Bill holdings:\n\nTwitter avatar for @jerallaire\nJeremy Allaire\n@jerallaire\n1/ As part of our commitment to increasing transparency and disclosure around USDC, today we're publishing our first monthly breakdown of the USDC reserve assets, by each and every Treasury Bond and list of cash reserve custodians.circle.com/blog/providing…\nImage\nJuly 14th 2022\n\n545 Retweets2,780 Likes\nHe said that the company is working to get permission from banking partners to disclose how much it holds with each bank.\n\nOn the second, the separation between Circle’s business operations and USDC, Circle offers products that are separate from USDC, like APIs, SeedInvest, and Circle Yield. Given the recent meltdowns at Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and others, investors and commenters are most worried about Circle Yield, but Circle’s product is different in that it’s only available to institutional accredited investors. Currently, it offers very low rates.\n\nCircle Yield\nImportantly, Circle’s yield product doesn’t touch its USDC reserves. Circle doesn’t lend its USDC reserves to anyone, it lets institutional accredited investors earn yields on their own USDC.\n\nMore broadly, Circle has publicly stated that its USDC reserve funds are held for the benefit of USDC token holders: “Circle does not and will not use USDC holders’ money to run its business or pay its debts. These funds are in segregated accounts.”\n\nFurther, Circle is regulated as a Money Services Business and licensed under the rules and state money transmission licenses that govern major US payment institutions including Stripe, PayPal, and Apple.\n\nTo be clear, though: everything has risk. Theoretically, in my opinion, the biggest risk to USDC is that one of its bank partners completely implodes or the US Government defaults on its debt, in which case, God help us all. But it’s important to point out that even though USDC seems to be the most stable of the stablecoins, there are always risks and people always need to be careful with their money. The S-4 that Circle and Concord Acquisition Corp. filed with the SEC in relation to a proposed SPAC deal lists 23 risks on pages 29 and 30.  To be very clear: this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework.\n\nBased on conversations with investors and others in crypto, USDC is the most trusted stablecoin in the market. As one friend who’s deep in the bowels of the crypto trading community put it, “Anyone legit in the space holding stablecoins is holding USDC.”\n\nCurrently, there is $54.8 billion in USDC, which means it holds cash or Treasuries worth as much via its bank and custodian partners. Every year, Circle’s reserves are audited by a leading public accounting firm, and every month, accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP attests to the fact that it has as much or more in reserves as there are USDC outstanding.\n\nGrant Thornton LLP May 2022 Circle Attestation\nLike I said, boring. The most boring, even among fiat-backed fully-reserved stablecoins.\n\nTether, which issues the leading stablecoin by market cap, USDT, has come under fire numerous times over the years over concerns about what it does with the money it receives in exchange for USDT. Stripe’s Patrick Mackenzie and friend of the newsletter Alex Danco both wrote great overviews of Tether’s issues in 2019, Patrick’s here and Alex’s here. This whole 85k follower Twitter account, Bitfinex’ed, rose to prominence for calling out Tether. One of the most serious allegations against Tether is that its CFO, Giancarlo Devasini, used Tether reserves to plug a hole in crypto exchange Bitfinex’s balance sheet, which was particularly troubling both because it meant that Tether was not fully reserved, and because Devasini was a large investor in Bitfinex.\n\nAmong the more recent claims against Tether are that its reserves are partially backed by billions of dollars in Chinese commercial paper, as reported by Bloomberg (and denied by Tether), and that it lent money to other crypto companies with Bitcoin as collateral. Additionally, the company settled a lawsuit with New York’s attorney general “over allegations that they moved hundreds of millions of dollars to cover up the apparent loss of $850 million of commingled client and corporate funds” for $18.5 million.\n\nCover of Bloomberg Businessweek\nDespite the heat, and the lawsuits, and the government scrutiny, Tether has proven to be Teflon, maintaining a $65.9 billion market cap, down from a high of $83 billion achieved before UST spooked the market for all but the most stable stables.\n\nTether’s legitimacy has been debated ad nauseum and is out of the scope of this essay, but it’s worth noting that despite $17 billion in net outflows, Tether currently trades at $1. For his part, Jeremy Allaire said on the Bankless podcast that he believes that Tether will be around for a long time and has useful applications, particularly in Asia.\n\nBut when the job of a stablecoin is to earn trust, any hair is an impediment. At the heart of Tether’s challenges is the fact that the company is not transparent, and doesn’t disclose where its money is held or what it holds. Particularly in a market like this one, that’s not ideal.\n\nTransparency is where Circle stands out. Largely by earning more trust, USDC is on its way toward flipping USDT as the largest stablecoin. As DeFi Surfer highlighted in Crypto’s Third Trillion Dollar Opportunity, USDC is rapidly gaining market share:\n\nCoinGecko Data Charted by DeFi Surfer\nTrust is foundational for stablecoins: people need to trust that their internet dollar will get them a fiat dollar. Trust is the main reason that USDC is stealing market share from USDT, and one of the reasons that fiat-backed stablecoins remain much larger than algorithmic or crypto-backed stablecoins.\n\nMaintaining trust isn’t easy, though. It requires resisting temptation.\n\nHow Do Stablecoin Issuers Generate Revenue?\nLet’s take a quick but very important aside to understand how stablecoin issuers generate revenue. It’s weird to think of a currency, digital or otherwise, as a business, but understanding how it works will help you understand the motivations of different stablecoin issuers.\n\nVery simply put, the revenue formula for stablecoin issuers is $ in Reserves \\* Yield on $’s in Reserves.\n\nSo a useful framing to keep in mind as you read this piece is that there are two main ways that a stablecoin issuer can increase its revenue:\n\nGrow Reserves\n\nGenerate a Higher Yield on Reserves\n\nGrowing reserves is straightforward. As a stablecoin issuer issues more stablecoins, it trades $1 from the customer for 1 dollar-denominated stablecoin that it creates. It puts that $1 in its reserve. If someone redeems, they give the $1 back in exchange for the 1 stablecoin. So you can think of this growth lever like most companies: increase usage of the product.\n\nGenerating a higher yield on reserves is a little more complicated, and this is where stablecoin issuers can get into trouble. Stablecoin issuers need to generate some yield, that’s how the business works.\n\nKeeping every dollar in USD when redemptions are paid out in USD guarantees that there will always be a dollar available (assuming the banks you’re depositing with don’t go out of business), but bank accounts generate next to nothing.\n\nThe next-least-risky is short-duration US Treasury bonds, like 1-month and 3-Month T-Bills. The yield on 3-Month T-Bills is commonly referred to as the “risk-free rate.” Something very bad would need to happen to not be able to get your dollar back from the US Treasury.\n\nToday, 3-Month T-Bills offer a rate of 2.29%, meaning $1 billion in reserves invested in 3-Month T-Bills would generate $22.9 million per year in risk-free\\* interest income. (\\*Nothing is really risk-free.) Not bad!\n\nBut for some, having $1 billion just sitting there earning the risk-free rate is too boring. There’s so much more money to be made! For them, there are a bunch of different ways to generate higher yields on reserves, including:\n\nA fractional reserve model (like banks) means that you can lend each dollar more than once.\n\nInvesting reserves in riskier assets should generate higher yields on each dollar. Riskier assets might include longer duration Treasuries (like a 10-Year Treasury Bond), commercial paper, Chinese commercial paper, Yankee Deposits, DeFi, crypto-lending, and even equity or fund investments.\n\nPushing 25% of the reserves into even slightly riskier debt that generates something like 4% would mean an additional $4.275 million in interest income per year versus putting it all in 3-Month T-Bills, juicing revenue 19% by doing something that, in most market environments, should be totally fine.\n\nBut each basis point of additional yield comes with additional risk. The history of financial markets is full of examples of things that should have been safe in most market environments blowing up spectacularly. CeFi lenders like Voyager and Celsius were riskier than they seemed. Companies default on debt. Countries can default on their debts. During the Global Financial Crisis, the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck”, almost destroying the economy as investors withdrew $172 billion from money market accounts before the Fed stepped in.\n\nOver a long enough time horizon, increasing yields on reserves is antithetical to growing $ in reserves, because increasing yields decreases the chance that there will be a dollar there when people want to redeem, which ultimately decreases trust. For pegged stablecoins, trust is paramount. Whoever engenders the most trust among investors through their actions and transparency will win through growth.\n\nCircle has opted to grow reserves, rather than chase higher yields, in order to grow revenue.\n\nWin trust. Grow $ in reserves. Win more trust. Become the standard that developers and financial institutions rely on to build new tools and capabilities.\n\nBecause while the value prop that 1 USDC = $1 is crucially important, it’s just the starting point.  What makes stablecoins particularly compelling is their digital superpowers.\n\nWhy Are Stablecoins a Valuable Primitive?\nCryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH haven’t caught on as a medium of exchange outside of the crypto economy. The main reason is that they’re so volatile.\n\nWhat consumer wants to spend 1 ETH on rent and watch the price rocket up 10% the next day? What business wants to receive 1 ETH for services rendered and watch the price fall 10% the next day?\n\nThe most obvious benefit of stablecoins relative to more volatile tokens is just that: their stability. If both parties in a transaction can reasonably assume that 1 USDC = $1, they can transact like they would in dollars.\n\nThe bigger question is why stablecoins are useful relative to good ol’ fashioned dollars, or the bank-intermediated versions thereof. To answer that, we need to start with what I think is the most fundamental thing to understand about crypto in general: crypto gives physical properties to digital assets.\n\nCash has some advantages over bank accounts. If you have $1,000,000 stashed under your mattress, and you need to pay a business associate $100,000, you can simply pull out a few stacks and pay them directly, right now, for free. Often, if you tried to make the same payment through a bank, you might have to pay wire fees (especially if you want the transaction to settle on the same day) or even need to physically go to the bank to sign papers. If your associate is in another country, that’s probably another fee, and it’s going to take a while. Oh, it’s Saturday? You’ll need to try again on Monday, between 9am - 4pm.\n\nPaper cash has some obvious drawbacks, too. It doesn’t earn anything. Keeping all of that money under your mattress might make for an uncomfortable night’s sleep. If your house catches on fire, the money disappears. A robber can break into your house and steal it. More practically, to give $100,000 to your business associate, one of you is going to need to travel to the other. If you live nearby, that’s a minor headache; if you live in different countries, it becomes very impractical. And then, once you do exchange the money, you need to manually enter the transaction in your accounting software of choice.\n\nAnyway, you know the limitations of cash. There are reasons we don’t use it much anymore. Sending wires online, or even Venmos for smaller sums, is so much more convenient than cash that people put up with the slowness, fees, and lack of control that comes with online banking.\n\nBut… there’s gotta be a better way, right?\n\nThat’s the basic thing stablecoins are trying to achieve: cash with digital superpowers.\n\nIn a great thread on the importance of stablecoins, ChainLinkGod spelled out those superpowers.\n\nTwitter avatar for @ChainLinkGod\nChainLinkGod.eth\n@ChainLinkGod\n1/ Stablecoins are the Trojan Horse that will bring smart contracts to the masses\n\nWhy?\n\nThey’re the probably the first and only real-world use-case of crypto today that is fully sustainable and rapidly scaling\n\nA 🧵 on #Stablecoins and how they’ll take over the global economy\nImage\nMay 23rd 2022\n\n269 Retweets1,050 Likes\nHe tweeted that stablecoins are a “superior form of fiat” that are:\n\nProgrammable\n\nPermissionless\n\nBorderless\n\nLow-cost\n\nFast settlement\n\nInteroperable\n\nHighly liquid\n\nLet’s unpack each.\n\nProgrammable means that stablecoins can be coded to do certain things automatically. In a simple example, if I get my paycheck in stablecoins, a smart contract can automatically release my payment directly every two weeks (or every day, or every hour, given the low transaction costs) with just my wallet address. Some can even be sent to a DeFi lending protocol where I can earn yield, or swapped into ETH, automatically.\n\nPermissionless means that I can send you a stablecoin, right now, with just your wallet address, without needing to go through a bank, just like cash, but digital. It also means that developers can build applications that use stablecoins without speaking to the issuer.\n\nBorderless means that there’s no distinction between sending money to someone in your same country and another country – there’s no such thing as an “international wire” here. I saw the power of this firsthand when a few of Not Boring Capital’s LPs asked to fund their commitments via USDC because the process was so much simpler, cheaper, and faster than trying to fund internationally through their bank.\n\nLow-cost is pretty self-explanatory, but also means that there aren’t any bank fees for holding or sending money. Today, on Ethereum, gas fees can be prohibitive for smaller transactions, but that gas fee remains constant whether you’re sending $1 or $1 million. But already, sending USDC on an Ethereum Layer 2 like Polygon – which is what Stripe does (more below) – or a cheaper L1 like Solana brings the cost down to next-to-nothing. Over time, sending money should be as cheap as sending an email.\n\nFast settlement means that as I send money to someone, or receive money from someone, that money is actually in my account and not in their account. If you’ve ever had pending transactions in your bank account, or received a payment that’s on the way but not yet in your account, you’ve felt slow settlement. For a good time, check out this Quora on how bank settlement works. Fast settlement, combined with features like programmability and interoperability, mean that money should be able to zip around faster than in the traditional system (at least in the US today; countries like India have better systems, and faster settlement should be coming to the US via FedNow.)\n\nInteroperable means that stablecoins can plug into any of the other web3 protocols and applications, and even into many traditional companies, seamlessly. Interoperability makes stablecoins behave a bit like platforms, which we’ll touch on shortly.\n\nHighly liquid means that there’s enough stablecoin out there that they can easily be bought or sold. There’s over $54.8 billion of USDC alone in the system.\n\nObviously, there are risks as well.\n\nFor example, what happens when you send your money to the wrong address? Unless there’s someone really nice on the other end, that money is gone. What happens if you forget your seed phrase and can’t access your wallet? Money’s gone in that case, too. Wallet gets hacked? Gone. And there’s no bank on the other end to make you whole.\n\nThese are real risks for any self-custodied digital asset, and before buying, holding, or sending digital assets, you need to make sure that you’re using best practices like hot and cold wallets, sending test transactions, and never, ever clicking on a Metamask support link. It should get safer over time, as both Circle and the broader developer ecosystem are building products and infrastructure to mitigate the risks and protect users.\n\nBack to the benefits, this being crypto, all of those pieces can combine and compose to create novel benefits. Or rather, entrepreneurs can combine those features to create novel apps that would not have been possible before.\n\nTo date, the largest use case for stablecoins has been crypto trading. Funds and individual traders use stablecoins for a bunch of reasons – instant settlement, complex trades without currency risk (needing to make a directional bet on the price of Bitcoin), access to foreign exchange, taking on leverage, and accessing the DeFi markets, where you can’t just plug in US Dollars. Plus, if you want to trade on a decentralized exchanged (“DEX”) like Uniswap, you can’t transact in USD; if you want to sell ETH, for example, for an asset that doesn’t have currency risk against the US Dollar, you’ll trade it for USDC or another dollar-denominated stablecoin.\n\nUSDC is used for all of those things, but Circle’s real ambition is to be a platform on top of which developers build novel, previously-impossible financial products.\n\nThis is probably a good place to pause for a second and give a little bit of Circle’s history. It wasn’t always a stablecoin company. Its story is a familiar one for platform and API-first companies (see: Amazon AWS & Lithic): build a consumer product, realize the infrastructure doesn’t work, build your own infrastructure, and productize the infrastructure.\n\nCircle’s History: From Bitcoin to USDC\nCircle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire started the company in the early days of crypto, back in 2013, to help consumers “more easily convert, store, send, and receive digital currencies such as bitcoin.”\n\nAllaire was already a tech veteran at the time, having founded the eponymous Allaire Corp. and online video services provider Brightcove before founding Circle.\n\nJeremy Allaire, Circle\nFun fact: after going down the internet rabbit hole in 1990, when it was largely a tool for the government and academia, Jeremy realized that there was an opportunity to commercialize it. In 1992, he wrote a proposal for the commercialization of the internet and submitted it to the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Science & Technology… Al Gore. When Al Gore famously mentioned to Wolf Blitzer that he “took the initiative in creating the internet,” he did so in part based on Jeremy’s proposal.\n\nAnyway, with Jeremy’s background and the early excitement around bitcoin, he had no trouble raising money. Per PitchBook:\n\n2013: $9 million Series A from Breyer Capital, Accel, and General Catalyst\n\n2014: $17 million Series B led by the same investors with Pantera Capital\n\n2015: $50 million Series C led by Goldman Sachs & IDG Capital at a $250M valuation\n\n2016: $60 million Series D led by IDG Capital at a $480 million valuation\n\n2018: $110 million Series E led by Bitmain at a $3 billion valuation\n\nAmazingly, it raised all $246 million before landing on, and announcing, what would become its killer app: USDC, which it announced in May of 2018.\n\nJoao Reginatto, Circle’s VP Product, told me that when he joined the company seven years ago, he signed up to be the product manager for Circle’s consumer app, Circle Pay.\n\nThe plan was to build a product for people who wanted to transfer funds over blockchain rails with an app that abstracted away the complexity and provided a familiar experience. People are most familiar and comfortable with fiat currency, so they enabled Dollar, Euro, and Pound balances and transfers, on Bitcoin’s rails. In the background, they handled all of the liquidity and treasury operations, like converting dollars into BTC and back.\n\nBut by 2016, it was getting too slow to operate on Bitcoin, which was built to be P2P money, not to support apps on top. Then, they tried ETH and it wasn’t quite right, either. Then, they thought about launching their own settlement token. No go. Finally, they realized that what they needed was fiat currencies that run on blockchains.\n\nThey looked into Tether, but didn’t think they could build on top of it, so the team realized they’d need to create their own stablecoin. They brought it to the leadership team, who said, “OK! Go build a stablecoin if you don’t have the rails you need, and then we can come back to Circle Pay.”\n\n“Then,” Joao laughed, “We never came back.”\n\nIn September 2018, Circle and Coinbase launched USDC, and in October, they announced that they’d co-founded the Centre Consortium, “a joint venture aimed at establishing a standard for fiat on the internet and providing a governance framework and network for the global, mainstream adoption of fiat stablecoins.” USDC began circulation in October 2018, and by the first day of 2019, there was $288 million USDC in circulation. To this day, Centre is jointly-owned by Circle and Coinbase and helps set the direction for the protocol, while Circle is the issuer of USDC.\n\nCircle’s history building consumer financial products on the blockchain informed the way that they built USDC.\n\nFirst, it set the tone for Circle’s regulatory and compliance stance from day one.\n\nAs Jeremy explained, one of the earliest questions he and his investors asked about operating financial services on the blockchain was, “Is this even legal?” Some first-time entrepreneurs might just let it rip, but Jeremy had already sold companies and built up a reputation, and he wanted to do it right.\n\nHe hired one of the country’s top regulatory advisory firms out of his own pocket, and they found that while there wasn’t a lot of precedent or guidance, there was some. In March 2013, the US Department of Treasury issued a six-page memo titled, “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies.” Essentially, it said that if you act as an exchanger of money from the banking system to digital currency, you must register as a money transmitter, have Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorism policies in place, and get all the appropriate licenses.\n\nJeremy put it more bluntly: “The reality was, if you wanted to build a business at the intersection of the traditional and new systems, you had to be regulated or go to jail.” But instead of turning him off, Jeremy was actually intrigued by, and drawn to, a space where so much policy work needed to be done:\n\nSomething new that changes society and introduces risk needs new policy – autonomous vehicles, AI, spacecraft, genetics. Regulated spaces are hard because the implications for society are more pronounced. I wanted to work on something hard, and something that was going to be hard globally.\n\nSo from day one, they “walked in through the front door.” The company’s first non-co-founder hire was its General Counsel / Chief Compliance Officer. Starting in late 2013, Jeremy said, “We got every license we possibly could, and became the most licensed and regulated firm in crypto at the time.” Circle was the first company to receive New York’s BitLicense, and helped shape it by providing feedback. According to Joao, after Circle got the first BitLicense, other people would come to the NYC office for meetings and ask to see it, as if it were a relic.\n\nEarly on, and to this day, “doing it in a regulated way brought on a lot of ‘boo hiss’ from the crypto community, but if you want this to be mainstream, you have to do it,” said Jeremy. From the beginning, Circle’s position has been to work with regulators to be part of the dialogue, educate, and “preserve what’s important about crypto: openness, interoperability, programmability, and its inherently global nature.”\n\nSecond, starting by attempting to create consumer products on blockchain rails meant that when Circle created USDC, they built it as a platform on which other developers could build beautiful and frictionless user experiences.\n\nFrom the beginning of USDC’s development, Joao “wanted to build with APIs in mind, and with scalability from the developer’s point of view.” They needed APIs to handle issuance and redemption from the beginning. As soon as the team got USDC to market in 2018, most of it pivoted immediately towards building out APIs and developer tools and documentation.\n\nCircle was preparing for a world in which USDC powered everyday applications in web3, maybe even that it would build itself again, but it was focused on building infrastructure.\n\nIn The Myth of the Infrastructure Phase, USV’s Dani Grant and Nick Grossman described the apps-infrastructure cycle: “First, apps inspire infrastructure. Then that infrastructure enables new apps.”\n\nThe Myth of the Infrastructure Phase, Dani Grant and Nick Grossman, USV\nA developer tries to build an app and realizes that it’s impossible or overly difficult to do with the current infrastructure, so other developers go out and build the infrastructure that would make those apps work, which opens up new possibilities for new apps, which have their own new infrastructure needs, and so on in an upward spiral. That certainly seems to apply to USDC’s development.\n\nCircle built the infrastructure, and started working with developers who were building applications to see how USDC could help. And then suddenly, DeFi Summer happened.\n\nThe explosion in DeFi’s popularity – led by protocols like Uniswap, Compound, Aave, and Maker – created an explosion in the developer ecosystem, and interest in embedding USDC in all of the new things they were creating. DeFi developers came to Circle with ideas – “We want to wrap USDC, but make it yield-bearing,” for example – and the Circle team said, “Go for it!” Since USDC is permissionless, Circle doesn’t give or refuse permission anyway, but they were psyched to see developers building new things with their primitive.\n\nUSDC adoption has driven Circle’s meteoric rise. In May 2021, with USDC’s market cap just above $20 billion, Circle announced a $440 million funding round from Fidelity, FTX, Digital Currency Group, and more. Later that year, it signed an agreement with SPAC Concord Acquisition Corp. to take it public at $4 billion. This February, it announced that the SPAC valuation more than doubled to $9 billion, and in April, it announced a $400 million round led by BlackRock and Fidelity, as USDC’s market cap grew to  $51 billion. There have been no recent announcements regarding the SPAC, and it’s possible that the deal expires before it gets to market given the current market reception of both crypto and SPACs.\n\nToday, while DeFi activity has cooled off, Joao told me that USDC itself, with its scale, gravity, and strength during the crash, is as close as it’s been in its entire journey to behaving like a platform.\n\nHow are USDC and Circle a Platform?\n\nWhen I first spoke to Jeremy, he told me that from the beginning, Circle wanted to build the http or smtp for money, protocols that are open, that anyone can connect to, but that allow for some things that http and smtp don’t, namely moving value and settling transactions.\n\nThe manifestation of that vision changed as Circle iterated its way towards product-market fit, but the vision itself remained consistent through the creation of USDC.\n\n“When we launched USDC,” he explained, “The concept was that the best way to launch was as a protocol that anyone can build on top of.”\n\nCircle needed to provide the dollar liquidity and market infrastructure, regulated infrastructure that connects bank money and US Treasury bonds with entities it onboards in a compliant way. Once USDC was in circulation, the combination of tokens and the protocol became a platform that anyone could build on top of.\n\nNow, the Circle team is focused on creating better infrastructure that abstracts away a lot of the complexity for developers and users, and on expanding the suite of stablecoins it offers.\n\nIt’s weird to think of digital money as a platform, but it works.\n\nThe other day, I was on a call with Joris Delanoue, the founder of Fairmint. Today, the company lets US companies issue equity in exchange for time & effort or a cash investment. The company is web2.5 – investments on Fairmint are compliant securities and the front-end feels very web2, but in the backend, it uses USDC and smart contracts to facilitate smoother, faster, cheaper transactions.\n\n“The USDC stablecoin is absolutely key to blurring the border between on- and off-chain,” Joris explained when my ears perked up, “It’s reliable and properly backed 1:1, and it lets us deliver a 10x better experience when dealing with (crytpo-native) securities.”\n\nNear the end of the call, after we went through all of the progress they’d made on the product, he threw in as an aside: “Oh, and we’re actually looking at the European market now that Euro Coin launched.” That’s a big unlock from a simple coin.\n\nThat conversation was the first time that USDC’s role as a platform clicked, but Fairmint is just one example of the many companies, both web3 and traditional, that are building on top of USDC today. Party Round, a Not Boring Capital portfolio company, lets companies raise, and investors invest, in both USDC and fiat. When I asked CEO Jordi Hays why they use USDC, he pointed to demand from both founders and investors, and said that it just makes the experience smoother: “A company can raise money from 50 people in 50 countries as easily as they could raise from 50 angel investors in the US. Instant is big. Global is big. 24/7 is big.”\n\nEstablished companies like Visa, MoneyGram, Twitter, and Stripe are working with USDC to facilitate crypto payments, too.\n\nIn March 2021, Visa announced that it had become the first major payments network to settle transactions in USDC, writing:\n\nVisa’s standard settlement process requires partners to settle in a traditional fiat currency, which can add cost and complexity for businesses built with digital currencies. The ability to settle in USDC can ultimately help [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) and other crypto native companies evaluate fundamentally new business models without the need for traditional fiat in their treasury and settlement workflows.\n\nVisa’s partnership is an important stamp of approval for USDC – Visa is a $427 billion market cap global leader in moving money – and is still in the early innings, focused on settling money within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nStripe pushed the ball a bit further, towards non-crypto-native platforms and users. In April 2022, Stripe announced that it was introducing global crypto payouts, starting with Twitter creators, with USDC on top of Polygon. Stripe highlighted that crypto payouts will let platforms “quickly pay out to their users in even more countries, and improve their services for those who prefer crypto over traditional fiat payment methods.”\n\nWorking with established companies, which are often more conservative than their web3 counterparts, has pushed Circle to answer more sophisticated questions. Speaking with people at Stripe, it’s clear that they’re not just going to do crypto to do crypto; they need to understand how it works down to the most minute detail. Joao said that web2 and traditional payments companies are a lot more focused on questions like, “Which chain should we use? Or should we use multiple? If we use multiple, how exactly does bridging work and is it secure?”\n\nThey also have more demanding requirements. “For USDC to be an actual platform for millions of developers,” Joao highlighted, “We need to build out infrastructure that other financial platforms have.”\n\nCircle plans to build out a lot of new infrastructure on-chain, and is particularly focused on how to raise the level of abstraction for developers. For example, Stripe is starting with Polygon, but plans to expand to more blockchains later this year:\n\nStripe\nThat infrastructure should make it so easy to use USDC cross-chain that which chain a developer or user wants to use should be an implementation detail. As Joao put it, “If there’s a merchant who wants to receive USDC on Solana, but the payer is on Ethereum, we want to make that happen easily. We’ll need to abstract away things like bridges, exchanges, gas costs, and more to make it happen.”\n\nIt might also build out specific SDKs that make it easy for web2 and web3 companies to build products around USDC. “The web2 opportunity is huge.”\n\nThink about the apps you use every day. Twitter, which consumes \\~99.99% of my app time, is already connected to USDC via Stripe. Many of the most popular apps – like Uber and Airbnb – have wallets built-in, even though you might not think of them like that.\n\nUber (left) and Airbnb (Right)\nCurrently, those companies need to register in multiple jurisdictions and set up different banks based on where they operate. Airbnb, for example, is an e-money company in Europe and needs to hold and maintain a license to hold customer balances. Building with something like a Circle wallet SDK, they might be able to let users self-custody, top up their accounts, and spend frictionlessly with much less headache for both Uber & Airbnb, and for users.\n\nThose are pretty straightforward examples, and there are a lot of similar opportunities to build financial products for directly or indirectly financial web2 apps, but the bigger opportunity will likely arise from all of the new companies that couldn’t have been built before.\n\nAs Circle builds out tools and infrastructure to traditional companies’ more exacting standards, developers in web3 will get access to those same capabilities, without ever needing to talk to a human at Circle.  The infrastructure Circle creates, and USDC itself, are open, interoperable, and permissionless.\n\nThere are some obvious challenges that need to be solved to get to a place where stablecoin rails replace the 20th century Fortran-based infrastructure that the financial system is built on top of today. On– and off- ramps, from fiat to crypto and back, need to get smoother. There need to be more options for custody between a Coinbase account and full self-custody with an 18-word seed phrase, like Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and social recovery. Options for refundable transactions will need to be made available. Circle can build some of this into its APIs and SDKs, and the developer ecosystem as a whole will keep developing new solutions to the known challenges.\n\nThere will need to be more regional stablecoins, too, representing the Pound, Yen, and hundreds of other fiat currencies used around the world in order for stablecoins’ global potential to be realized. There, too, Circle expects to build in certain cases and partner in others.\n\nCircle plans to keep creating new, regulated, fully-backed stablecoins and better, smoother infrastructure, creating a platform on top of which anyone with an internet connection and some skills can build. It can give those tools to developers for free while still building a massive, profitable business because of the way it makes money. It even has a venture arm, Circle Ventures, that invests in products in the ecosystem that leverage USDC in order to accelerate development in the space.\n\nIn fact, Circle is incentivized to make it as cheap, safe, and easy as possible for anyone to build on top of USDC, EUROC, and future stablecoins because Circle makes more money when more of its stablecoins are in circulation.\n\nCircle has iterated its way into one of the best business models on the internet.\n\nWhat is Circle’s Competitive Advantage?\nHere’s the beauty of Circle’s business model: it charges customers nothing, which increases its scale, and makes more money as it gets bigger by investing its reserves in safe assets.\n\nIn many ways, Circle is an example of what Chris Burniske calls Protocols as Minimally Extractive Coordinators. In it, he writes: “The less extractive a protocol is in coordinating exchange, the more that form of exchange will happen.”\n\nWhen dollars are converted into bits and bytes, friction and transaction costs go down. Since Circle doesn’t charge developers or users to use USDC – since it’s minimally extractive – more exchange should happen in USDC. As more exchange happens in USDC, and more USDC circulates, Circle holds conservative reserves to ensure that liquidity is always on hand to redeem USDC for a dollar at par. The portion of those reserves held in US Treasuries, I would assume, generate income for Circle, without needing to charge users or developers.\n\nThat’s why, in addition to what I believe are the team’s genuine ambitions to create a better, faster, cheaper, and more open financial system, a stablecoin company can pour resources into building out infrastructure that it gives away for free. It’s building a platform business that monetizes through interest on reserves instead of fees.\n\nUSDC is building network effects that boggle the mind, and come from two sources: the platform and the money itself.\n\nThinking about USDC as a platform, it has classic network effects that are somewhere between Marketplace (2-sided) and Platform (2-sided) network effects as described in NFX’s Network Effects Manual.\n\nNFX: The Network Effects Manual\nWithout going too deep into the weeds on the differences – which come from whether supply builds for just one platform or multiple – Circle’s flywheels look like this:\n\nFirst, as more developers build on USDC, USDC gains more utility (it can be used to transact in more products), which creates more demand for circulation, which creates an incentive for more developers to build on and integrate with USDC. It becomes the de facto starting point for developers and partners looking to build with stablecoins.\n\nThe second network effect comes from the money itself. Specifically, the more USDC there is in circulation, the more utility it has. A simple way to think about this is that $1 million is worthless if you’re the only person in the world who uses dollars, but very useful if everyone uses dollars.\n\nThis is classic Metcalfe’s Law: the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants in the network.\n\nThe bigger and more widely used USDC becomes, the more valuable it is to everyone who uses it and to all of the developers who build on it. And because its platform is money and therefore it’s able to give away its infrastructure practically for free and monetize its reserves, Circle should be able to grow developer and user adoption faster than web2 platforms and APIs that need to charge users to build sustainable businesses.\n\nThis is Circle’s competitive advantage against tech challengers, but it might soon face a much larger competitor.\n\nOne of the perceived challenges to USDC is that the US government might issue a Central Bank Digital Currency (“CBDC”) in part to maintain the dollar’s position as the global reserve currency in an increasingly digital economy. China is going that route with the e-CNY. Circle believes that USDC and other commercial dollar-backed stablecoins give the US the best of both worlds: the innovation benefits of an open, competitive, capitalist ecosystem that also increases demand for USD as all USDC are redeemable 1:1 for USD. If you’ve been reading Not Boring, you know which approach I think makes the most sense, but it might not be either-or.\n\nDante Disparte, Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Global Policy, believes that CBDCs and commercial dollar-backed stablecoins can co-exist.\n\n“What we’re building for,” he told me, “is something cross-border versus domestic. USDC is internet-scale and designed for open, permissionless, more equitable economic activity on the internet. A CBDC is invariably domestic and transmits the risk to the taxpayer.” Earlier this month, Dante wrote Borderless money in a hot, flat, and crowded world to lay out his position in more detail, and last week, Circle’s VP of Policy & Regulatory Strategy Teana Baker-Taylor dropped a thread on the view that private and public digital money can co-exist:\n\nTwitter avatar for @TeanaTaylor\nTeana Baker-Taylor\n@TeanaTaylor\nRight now, at least 105 central banks, representing \\~95% of global GDP, are evaluating creating a CBDC.\n\nQuestion I receive daily:\nWhat happens to #stablecoins when #CBDC's come online?\n\nMy short answer: public & private money co-exist today.\nBut...🧵👇🏻\nJuly 14th 2022\n\n8 Retweets28 Likes\nTime will tell, but the government might be less of a competitor than it is a complement.\n\nIn fact, Circle’s skill and experience working with governments is its second source of competitive advantage.\n\nIn addition to the advantages that Circle gets with scale, it has a regulatory and compliance advantage over new entrants and existing competitors. Over the past nine years, it has poured resources and countless hours into building out best-in-class internal compliance, getting all of the necessary licenses to operate in the US and abroad, and working with policymakers to craft sensible legislation. It’s had to convince conservative companies like BNY Mellon, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, not to mention top insurance companies and auditing firms, to work with it. In doing so, and operating to a high bar, it’s established strong relationships with key players.\n\nIf it seemed fairly certain that regulators would crack down on risky stablecoins, like Luna’s UST, before the recent meltdown, it’s all but guaranteed now. It’s clear that stablecoins will be regulated, and that stablecoin issuers will be held to the highest standards. Circle is working to make sure that, as Jeremy described it, “policies don’t put the genie back in the bottle.”\n\nIn a more regulated space, Circle’s trust will be an even bigger competitive advantage, as Dante explained:\n\nFor some, the feature in stablecoins was opacity, lack of regulation, frictionlessness — all interesting during good times, but when you’re running for the exit and looking for redemption is when trust matters most. You can’t buy insurance when your house is on fire. We’ve been doing things that will increasingly become the global regulatory standard well before it was a requirement.\n\nHe believes that we’ll see thoughtful, pro-innovation regulation from the US Government and that regulators will see the importance of “same risk, same rules” in creating “more optionality in payment systems rather than disrupting and disintermediating banks.”\n\nWhile the government can’t regulate math, it can and will regulate the behaviors of firms issuing stablecoins. And when it does, Circle has a near-decade-long headstart.\n\nIn order to compete with Circle, new fiat-backed stablecoin issuers will not only need to overcome its strong network effects, scale economies, and cash generation machine, they’ll need to do so while building up the compliance infrastructure, and trust, that Circle has.\n\nAre the barriers to entry high? Yes. But Jeremy pointed out that there were high barriers to entry in competing with Facebook, too, before Instagram and TikTok came along. Ultimately, the company seems willing to support and partner with anyone in the space who can contribute to building a new, internet-native financial system.\n\nWhat Would a New Financial System Built on Circle’s Rails Look like?\nIf you were to design a new financial system today, from scratch, with all of the existing technologies, how would you design it?\n\nThere’s another benefit of stablecoins, specifically fully-reserved stablecoins like USDC and DAI, that we haven’t touched upon but that’s worth highlighting: separating the payment function of money from the lending function of money.\n\nToday, both governments and banks can create money. Governments create a certain amount, people and businesses put their money in bank accounts, and then banks can lend out multiples of that money based on reserve requirements. That’s called “fractional reserve banking,” and the amount that banks can lend out relative to deposits is dictated by the Liquidity Coverage Ratio laid out in Basel III. (If you want to have a wild time, you can read all 75 pages here.)\n\nThere are issues with a fractional reserve banking system, as seen during the Global Financial Crisis, but Basel III goes a long way towards fixing them. As with anything when I write about web3, I don’t think the benefit is in taking down big evil corporations for the sake of it, banks included. I worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great people. Instead, to me, one of the main benefits is who the value can accrue to when you remove those middlemen.\n\nWhen you deposit your money at a bank, they lend it out over and over, and earn interest for doing so. I haven’t checked my account recently, but the interest is typically comically low (and they charge me a $5/mo “maintenance fee”!). The four biggest banks in the US alone – JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo – generated a combined $173 billion in net interest income in 2021.\n\nSource: Company Filings\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income a bank earns from lending and the interest it pays out to depositors. Presumably, those numbers will go up this year in a rising interest rate environment; depositors don’t care enough to move banks for a few extra basis points.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with banks making money. It’s their job, and a lot of smart people have built out a lot of sophisticated infrastructure to do it well. But it is an opportunity for challengers. In the bull case for DeFi, that $173 billion represents the value available to be either made by lenders or saved by borrowers. The math is rough – on one side, there are a lot more banks in the world, and on the other, fully reserved means fewer loans for each dollar, among other factors – but directionally correct as a starting point.\n\nThe difference is that in this system, the net interest income should go to the people who own the dollars, not to banks. With stablecoins, anyone can plug into a DeFi lending protocol and lend money to generate returns higher than 0.01%, or whatever they’d earn in their savings account.\n\nFor this opportunity to even sniff the TradFi interest income opportunity, a lot needs to happen. For one, DeFi will need to begin to touch real world assets (RWA) like cars, small businesses, and yes, mortgages. There are a lot of challenges there, but there are also a lot of smart people working to solve them.\n\nThe technological building blocks are starting to come into place, but the biggest headwind won’t be the technology, it will be the law. City Councils will need to recognize NFT Titles. The Federal government will need to come out with clear regulation. Battles will be fought in the court. “This happened with the internet, too,” Jeremy pointed out, before the internet became the fabric of everything that it is today.\n\nIn interviews, Jeremy applauds the US government’s approach to regulating the internet. When it was first taking off, government officials talked about making people and businesses apply to be able to create a website, but luckily, they chose to let it remain open. The internet we know and love today owes a debt of gratitude to those early regulatory decisions. Today, stablecoin regulation is at the same inflection point internet regulation was at two decades ago.\n\nOpen or closed?\n\nGovernment-run (Central Bank Digital Currency or “CBDC”) or commercial?\n\nAs more people begin to use stablecoins to transact and borrow and lend and get paid and do all sorts of things online, as consumers get more comfortable with the technology, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll want to go back to the way things were.\n\nThey’ll want to tap into liquid global pools of capital to borrow money to buy a house at a lower rate than they can get from a bank, instantly and permissionlessly, and they’ll want to be able to directly earn more from their money than they’re able to get from their bank account. This will likely eventually be true in the US, and it will likely be useful to people in other countries, where mortgages are harder to come by and more expensive, far sooner.\n\nAs leading DeFi protocols continue to demonstrate their sturdiness in volatile markets, and as the interfaces improve, consumers and institutions alike will get more comfortable with this online financial system. That will take time, and a lot needs to be built and worked out.\n\nBut all of the current problems are solvable problems, particularly when the goal isn’t “total decentralization,” but rather “more widespread access on smoother rails.” Some people will go full DeFi, others will work with lenders who build some pieces on USDC rails. As with Circle itself, there will be a trade-off: some centralization in exchange for a range of improvements over the current system.\n\nAs always, the most impactful innovations will likely be the ones we haven’t even dreamed up. “There are huge categories that haven’t been created or even thought of,” Jeremy said:\n\nWe have programmable money, dollars as a native data type, a protocol you can use to interact, and computation environments (smart contracts) to write code that interacts with all of that. We have transparent, open, risk-managed credit facilities on the internet. We’re getting close to the point where USDC and other stables can transact with sub-second finality for a penny or two.\n\nWhat can you do with all of that? I don’t know! We’re in the very early stages of discovering what people can build.\n\nOne thing is clear: to reach mass adoption, we’ll need better interfaces. An app that Jeremy thinks we’ll see, and will need to see for widespread adoption, is a superapp like Tencent’s WeChat that combines Decentralized Identity, Decentralized Social, messaging, stablecoins, payments, the ability to interact with tokenized IP, one view of the NFTs that have utility for you (and links to the places those NFTs have utility via tokengated commerce), and more. “But in order for that product to exist,” he said, “the things that provide those services need to exist.”\n\nUSDC is just one piece of infrastructure. For Circle to achieve its mission – to raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value - there will need to be advances in commerce that uses NFTs, entitlements, reputation, identity, scalable zero-knowledge technology, and more. Jeremy readily admits that the current model where people can see your transaction history is not going to work.\n\nBut he’s optimistic that we’ll get to a place where USDC is baked into a new financial and internet system that was built in and for the internet age. I agree.\n\nThere’s a popular narrative among web3 skeptics that we don’t need crypto because banks and fintechs work just fine. Why would you need to send money abroad with stablecoins when something like Wise exists? I’m a big fan of, and investor in, fintech companies. Moving money has gotten much better in the last decade.\n\nBut the skeptics’ belief is essentially that we’ve reached the end of the road when it comes to financial innovation – that the FORTRAN and COBOL-based rails work just fine, and that it’s not worth trying to build new rails on technology developed in the past decade.\n\nThat is insane to me, and ignores the history of both financial and technological innovation. Of course the financial system will be refactored – whether it takes a few years or a few decades – and it seems as if USDC will be a big part of that.\n\nAt the same time, I don’t think that stablecoins will replace banks or fintechs. Sometimes, they’ll co-exist. Increasingly, as is already happening, fintechs will build smoother, faster, cheaper, more global products on USDC rails, and provide the necessary guardrails, compliance, interfaces, and all sorts of other things that fintechs do best.\n\nAnd it won’t just be fintechs. As money and banking become embedded in more of the products we use every day, and new categories of products are created with new technologies, I expect that USDC will be a core piece of more and more companies’ tech stacks. That would mean more USDC in circulation, larger USDC reserves, and more interest income for Circle, without needing to push out the risk curve.\n\nTaking the trust-first approach, and building a platform, isn’t the fastest way to get rich. But it’s the safest, and it’s the only way to ensure that USDC lives up to its creators’ vision of raising global prosperity, a world in which Circle’s technology powers a modern, more fair financial system.", "timestamp": 1658539114, "digest": "m2gamT1c0znW6y3fcMKPnnweyNeMcNWLx6iNDVek95A", "contributor": "0x54664c16c3f5D0BC33bf914bC82dA9A2275f0EA2"}

Token 争夺市场》\n\n撰文：汤圆\n\n目前，在以太坊的 Layer2（L2）扩容解决方案中，采用 Rollup 技术的方案已经成为主流，并以不同的共识机制形成了已经落地的 L2 网络，主流网络代表 Optimism、Arbitrum、ZkSync 和 StarkNet。\n\n随着网络建成后应用的迁移，L2 网络开始陷入加密资产锁仓的争夺战中。\n\n数据网站 L2Beat 显示，截至 7 月 20 日，整个 L2 网络中锁仓的加密资产价值（TVL）由高到低的网络分别为 Arbitrum > Optimism > ZkSync > StarkNet。\n\nStarkNet 在落后的局面下开始效仿其他 L2 网络，将原生 Token 的发行提上了日程，要知道，激励在区块链世界是最好的引流手段。7 月 13 日，区块链扩容技术服务商 StarkWare 连发三篇博客，介绍其 Layer2 扩容网络 StarkNet 的原生 Token，包括经济治理模型、应用场景、发行数量及分配情况等。\n\n更早前的 4 月，Optimism 发行了原生 Token OP，并于 5 月 30 日正式上线二级市场。发行 OP 后的 Optimism 在 TVL 上开始凸显优势。\n\n尚未发行 Token 的 Rollup 系 L2 网络仅剩 Arbitrum 和 ZkSync，但从近期和过去的生态动态看，Token 发行也是迟早的事。\n\nZkSync 早在官方的用户文档中表态将会发行 Token，但未透露具体的发行时间并未透露。打开 ZkSync 用户文档页面，第一条就是关于「是否会有 Token」的提问，官方答案为「Yes」。\n\nArbitrum 没有明确表示将会发行 Token， 但它在 4 月 20 日发布了名为「The Arbitrum Odyssey」的生态探索活动，鼓励用户使用链上项目获得 NFT 奖励。不少用户猜测，参与活动、获得 NFT 奖励很有可能 Arbitrum 为之后发行 Token 设置的「用户领取资格」门槛。\n\n的确，使用链上应用形成的交互痕迹往往会成为用户获得 Token 空投的资格线。本期 DeFi 蜂窝将梳理 Rullup 系的四大 L2 网络（Optimism、Arbitrum、ZkSync 和 StarkNet）的链上生态情况。\n\nOptimistic Rollup 系 L2 网络的 TVL 更高\n\n既能保证区块链网络安全、又能提高网络吞吐量的 Rollup 技术，正在成为以太坊 Layer2 (L2) 扩容解决方案的主流技术。基于该技术形成的解决方案又因为共识算法的不同形成了 Optimistic Rollup 和 ZK Rollup 两大流派，且这两种解决方案都有了已经落地的 L2 网络。\n\n目前，Optimistic Rollup 的 L2 代表网络是 Optimism 和 Arbitrum；ZK Rollup 方案的 L2 落地网络的主要选手是 StarkNet 和 zkSync。\n\n根据 L2Beat 显示，截至 7 月 20 日，整个 L2 网络中锁仓的加密资产价值（TVL）为 43.6 亿美元，其中 Arbitrum 链上 TVL 为 21.5 亿美元，市场份额占比为 54%，排名第一；次之的是 Optimism，链上 TVL 为 7.6 亿美元；ZkSync 链上 TVL 仅为 6100 万美元；StarkNet 更少，链上 TVL 目前只有 70 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HQAHEKtmyjAEmgXH3S5MO.png?height=582&width=882)\n\nL2 网络 TVL 及市场份额数据\n\n可以看出，ZK Rollup 系的 zkSync 和 StarkNet，在 TVL、市场份额方面都远不如 Optimistic Rollup 系的 Optimism 和 Arbitrum。\n\n这主要是因为 Optimism 和 Arbitrum 的主网具有先发优势。Arbitrum 主网早在去年 8 月就正式上线，Optimism 主网于去年 7 月上线。而 ZK Rollup 系的 ZkSync 网络 1.0 版本虽在去年 7 月份上线，但由于底层技术原因，使用场景仅限于支付，直到今年 2 月公布的 zkSync 2.0 才兼容以太坊虚拟机（EVM），适合开发者使用；而 StarkNet 主网还一直处于公开测试阶段，并未正式上线。\n\nZK Rollup 系的网络落地要稍慢于另一派系，这主要是因为基于「零知识证明算法」的 ZK Rollup 技术方案较为复杂，落地需要时间。更重要的是，该系列的 L2 网络与 EVM 的兼容方面一直难有突破，直到 zkSync 2.0 版本出现才有了新转机，声称能够做到 99% 兼容。L2 网络与 EVM 的兼容直接关系到应用开发者的时间和经济成本，而没有应用的区块链网络很难吸引用户及资产。\n\n相反，Optimistic Rollup 系的 Arbitrum 能够做到完全兼容 EVM，支持以太坊链上的去中心化应用程序（DApp）直接迁移，目前，Uniswap、Curve、Aave、1inch 等以太坊的头部 DeFi 应用都在该网络上集成。Optimism 也在去年 11 月完成了与 EVM 完全兼容的升级。\n\nOptimism 先发代币\n\n在 TVL 上排名前两位的 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 网络，在生态布局上各具特色，发展路线也各不相同，前者更注重用户体验，后者则在发行了原生代币后实现了 TVL 的增长。\n\n说起来，Optimism 主网上线时间要早 Arbitrum 一个月。但去年 7 月，该网络上线时还没有做到 100% 兼 EVM，不能实现以太坊链上的 DApp 一键迁移，链上生态发展被后来者 Arbitrum 赶超。\n\n去年 11 月，Optimism 部署的 OVM 虚拟机 2.0 版本与 EVM 实现了完全等效，还能简化开发者的开发过程，降低费用，该网络的链上生态这才正式「发芽」。\n\n但是在早期，Optimism 链上应用主要围绕合成资产协议 Synthetix 来衍生新产品，由于这类产品多为复杂的期权、合约等 DeFi 金融衍生品，对于普通交易用户来说不易操作，更合适专业交易员使用。因此，该链上应用未能吸引大量用户和资金。\n\n直到今年 4 月 27 日，Optimism 公布了原生代币 OP 的发行方案后，用户的注意力才被吸引而来，它也是基于 Rollup 技术框架下的第一个发行代币的 L2 网络。\n\nOP 发行总量约为 42.9 亿个，总供应量将以每年 2% 的速度膨胀，主要用于社区治理、投票权和项目激励。总量 19% 的 OP 将空投给用户，其中首轮给社区空投了 5%，另外 14% 将在未来分配。\n\nOP 在空投后迅速上线二级市场，形成了交易价格，最高冲至 2 美元。有数据显示，OP 的最低空投数量为 409.42 个，按照高点价格，OP 最低空投价值约为 800 美元。早期用户的财富效应迅速吸引了市场注意，外部用户开始参与其生态，希望能在下波 OP 空投中被选中。\n\n在完成首轮空投后的 6 月 9 日，Optimism 拿出了 2.31 亿 OP 创建了激励基金，旨在资助 OP 生态系统中的建设者和项目，通过项目的 TVL、日交易量等指标决定 OP 的激励数量。\n\nToken 激励计划成功将用户和项目引入 Optimism 生态。据 Optimism 浏览器数据显示，6 月 2 日，也就是创建激励基金消息的一周前，该链上的日交易数最高冲至 48.7 万笔，日增地址数为 3.9 万。截至 7 月 20 日，该网络的链上地址数共有 121 万。\n\n代表应用\n\nOptimism Bridge——Optimism 官方跨链桥，支持将以太坊、Polygon、BSC 等 L1 公链以及 L2 网络 Arbitrum 上的资产跨链至 Optimism。\n\nLayerswap—— 加密资产从中心化交易所（CEX）直接提取至 L2 网络的工具，由加密支付基础服务商 Bransfer 开发。\n\nSynthetix（SNX）生态 —— 它原是建立在以太坊上的合成资产发行及交易应用，用户可通过超额抵押治理通证 SNX 生成各类合成资产。\n\n2021 年 9 月，Synthetix 宣布将应用从以太坊主网迁移至 Optimism 网络中，它成为第一个支持该 L2 网络的以太坊头部应用。其中 sUSD、sETH、sBTC、sLINK 等合成资产已经成为以太坊和 Optimism 网络上的主流资产。\n\nSynthetix 基于这些合成资产在 Optimism 网络上搭建了多个应用场景，包括合成资产综合交易平台 Kwenta、期权交易平台 Lyra、一站式期权投资平台 Polynomial、资产管理平台 dHEDGE、衍生品交易平台 Thales 等。\n\nZipSwap（ZIP）——Optimism 网络原生的去中心化交易应用（DEX），它基于 Uniswap v2 版本的代码构建，希望能为 Optimism 用户提供一个低费用的资产兑换场所。\n\nQuixotic——Optimism 原生的最大的 NFT 交易平台。\n\nArbitrum 死磕用户体验\n\nOP 的发行确实为 Optimism 生态带来了资金流量，但该网络的 TVL 仍然逊于仅比它晚一个月诞生的 Arbitrum，这又是为何？\n\nArbitrum 由 Offchain Labs 团队开发，尽管没有发行 Token，但同样注重激励。今年 4 月 20 日，官方公布了名为「The Arbitrum Odyssey」生态项目探索活动计划，该活动的主要目的是以 NFT 来激励用户与生态应用交互，让用户通过执行链上任务来了解和体验链上 DApp 的使用。\n\n活动为期 8 周，鼓励用户交互的应用覆盖了跨链桥、DeFi 和 NFT、游戏等多种场景，用户可以体验每期列出的应用，并完成相关任务，获得官方提供的 NFT。有不少用户猜测，NFT 很有可能会是 Arbitrum 发行代币后的空投资格凭证。\n\n6 月 22 日，The Arbitrum Odyssey 发起了首期活动，成功吸引了流量。根据 Arbiscan 浏览器显示，6 月 27 日，该链上日交易次数为 28.7 万笔，新增地址数为 5.6 万。用户的激增一度导致 Arbitrum 链上出现了严重拥堵，Gas 费升高。\n\n据 L2fees 数据，6 月 29 日，在 Arbitrum 网络上，每笔交易的平均 Gas 费用最高时飙至 9 美元以上，高于同期以太坊主网的 Gas 费两倍，参与用户的怨声沸腾。随后，Arbitrum 官方宣布暂停了活动。\n\n在提升用户体验层面上，Arbitrum 甚至开发了新链。7 月 12 日，该网络宣布构建了新链「Arbitrum Nova」, 目前已在以太坊主网运行，开发人员可在该链上部署相关应用程序。\n\n如此一来，Arbitrum 就变成了双链生态 ——Arbitrum One 和 Arbitrum Nova，前者是现有的主网，后者基于 AnyTrust 技术搭建，专为游戏、社交应用程序和对成本更敏感的用例而设计。\n\n之所以推出 Arbitrum Nova 链，是因为主网 Arbitrum One 因为底层共识算法的原因存在数据异议期，直接结果是用户将 Token 提回至以太坊网络时需要 7 天的等待期，影响用户体验的同时，对高吞吐量要求的应用场景也不够友好。\n\nArbitrum Nova 适合对成本敏感、有高交易量预期的应用场景，比如游戏和社交应用程序，而 Arbitrum One 将继续覆盖 DeFi 和 NFT 项目。\n\n代表应用\n\nHop Protocol 跨链桥 —— 主要支持加密资产在 L2 网络和 L1 网络之间的转移。\n\nArbitrum bridge——Arbitrum 官方跨链桥，支持以太坊资产跨链至 Arbitrum 网络，需要注意，资产从 L2 返回 L1 需要 7 天等待期。\n\nGMX—— 建立在 Arbitrum 链上的去中心化永续合约交易应用。\n\nTreasure DAO——Arbitrum 上的元宇宙和 NFT 基础层平台，融合了 NFT、DeFi 和 GameFi 应用。\n\nStargate—— 基于 LayerZero 协议开发的跨链应用，主要专注于原生资产跨链。\n\nZkSync 注重改进网络性能\n\n对于 Rollup 技术，以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin 多次在公开场合表示，ZK Rollup 是 L2 的终极之选，但由于其底层技术比较复杂，落地还需很长时间。\n\n基于 ZK Rollup 技术的 L2 网络中，StarkNet 和 zkSync 是主要代表，尽管在开发进度、生态数据表现上，二者都落后于 Optimistic Rollup 技术派的 L2，但由于能实现即时到账，依旧被外界看好。尤其是能够兼容 EVM 的 zkSync 2.0 的上线，开发进度已经超出了业内预期。\n\nzkSync 网络由 Matter Labs 团队搭建，其所有产品都开源，更偏向于社区化运营。Matter Labs 甚至多次表示出「自己被替代掉也无所谓」，目的只在推动以太坊社区发展。在发展路线上，该团队一直在致力于改进网络，提升性能。\n\nzkSync1.0 版本于 2020 年 6 月上线，主要聚焦于支付。由于不兼容 EVM，网络的可用性受到限制，能支持的应用场景非常有限。但由于转账费用低，到账即时，在支付场景上展现了优越性。\n\n今年 2 月，zkSync 2.0 版本的公共测试网上线，实现了 EVM 兼容，大概率会成为首个利用 ZK Rollup 方案并兼容 EVM 的区块链网络。zkSync2.0 支持开发人员使用以太坊原生编程语言 Solidity 在网络上部署 DApp，以太坊主网上现有的 DeFi 应用也可以集成至 zkSync2.0 网络上，享受 L2 网络带来的高效和低费优势。\n\n不过，zkSync2.0 的正式主网一直没有上线，有用户猜测，其主网上线很可能会和发行 Token 同时。当然，实际情况还需要等待官方消息。\n\n代表应用\n\n去中心化交易应用 ZigZag—— 采用订单簿模型的 DEX，试图成为中心化交易所（CEX）在链上的替代方案。\n\n跨链桥 Orbiter Finance—— 应用于 L2 网络，支持 zkSync、Arbitrum、Optimism 等 L2 网络间的资产跨链转移，也支持 L2 和 L1 网络间的资产互转。\n\nSyncSwap——zkSync 网络上原生的 DEX，目前还在测试中。\n\nStarkNet 将发行 Token\n\nStarkNet 由 StarkWare 公司搭建，它通过产品化的思路为 L2 解决扩容问题。\n\nStarkWare 公司创建于 2018 年，有一套完整的 L2 系统解决方案，在为以太坊扩容方面，它产出了 StarkNet（L2 网络）和 StarkEx（扩容引擎）两个落地产品。\n\nStarkEx 是一套可扩容的引擎技术，专门为以太坊 DApp 应用提供服务，本质上是一个连接 L1 与 L2 的数据处理器。该技术已经服务了不少知名的 DApp，包括去中心化永续合约交易应用 dYdX、去中心化交易应用 DeversiFi、NFT 生态系统 Immutable X 等。\n\nStarkNet 是一个通用的 L2 网络，测试网已于 2021 年 11 月上线，支持开发者进行应用部署。由于 StarkNet 还未兼容 EVM，因此，它一直没有获得以太坊头部应用的迁移，生态一直不瘟不火。\n\n如此状态下，StarkNet 决定发行 Token。\n\n7 月 13 日，StarkWare 连续发布 3 篇博客，介绍了 StarkNet 的原生代币，包括 Token 的经济治理模型、应用场景、发行数量及分配情况等，并表示 StarkNet 网络已经铸造了 100 亿枚代币，开始分配给 StarkNet 生态的贡献者及相关投资人。\n\n按照计划，StarkNet 的代币在今年 9 月以 ERC-20 标准在以太坊上流通，并在未来作为 StarkNet 网络 Gas 费的唯一支付手段。目前，StarkNet 网络 Gas 费以 ETH 结算。\n\n代表应用\n\n跨链桥 StarkGate—— 官方跨链桥，支持 L1 资产存入 StarkNet 网络中。\n\n一站式交易应用 JediSwap——StarkNet 上的自动做市商（AMM）机制的去中心化交易应用。\n\nStarkswap——StarkNet 上原生的 AMM 式 DEX。\n\n永续合约应用 ZKX——Starknet 上第一个去中心化金融衍生品应用，今年 7 月 18 日获得了 450 万美元的种子轮融资。\n\nZklend—— 去中心化借贷应用，今年 3 月完成了 500 万美元种子轮融资。\n\n来源链接", "timestamp": 1658539385, "digest": "chsM7Sj7IHsmV54kHkHuFc7vvSgiIbWqiXmgOUh_5ik", "contributor": "0xa9E79b67303334C7b24f2CCcAC3B4635183F6c29"}

"加密世界已然浮现多起，伴随着这个行业的熊熊轮回，也伴随着混乱的生机。项目的“兴衰”持续进化、生长。\n\n上一天的大牛市中，再一次是我们到了Layer1、Berana、街头的大价值。城市的价值发展迅速，年轻人迅速发展成熟，各种高速增长的同时应用，在链上也发现了基础市场的价值。\n\n时过这些日子，历经数月的洗礼，第一层中的大多数项目都表现出第一层的情况，然而，在过去的一段时间里，却一直过往的环境中，仍然拥有相当强的白日牛市），结合“每一轮的轮回、项目都将诞生于上一轮高亮的城市”的历史，此时开发阶段我们更应该把时间投射到更早的时候尚早的全新Layer1们。\n\n业内人士看来，“熊市级，牛市级”的目前来看，综合一级市场动态来看，新一代Layer1即将成为新机构的聚焦点，Aptos、Sui等明星项目都即将完成完成数亿美元等级的融资。\n\n为了帮助大家清楚地捕捉到Layer1O赛场的最新发展趋势，每日星球从近半年内走入大众视野且尚未发币的新兴Layer1入选中榜10家较具代表性的项目，项目组等，我们真正的应用情况、亮点、最新进展未来手机对Layer1进行\n\n提前说明是，但只是某个组中需要出现的项目均基于融资情况、始创背景、市场热度等因素筛选而出，保证项目最终能够以较早的阶段完成项目，因此无法如期顺利完成发展，并成功打开市场，因此不组合投资建议。\n\n**Aptos： 最强势的新生代 Layer1**\n\n2019 年，Facebook 联合圈内与其他机构共同改名了大声大片（最近公布了天秤座监管的启动区块，以方便阅读各个方面的项目统一使用天秤座）。尽管如此，天秤座最终压力落了个胎腹中，但该死的中心其实就职于 Libra 去开发者却继承了项目的一些开发成果（比如移动开发者以另一种方式去换取）是的全新 Layer1 项目。\n\n目前，已公开于零售设备设施的Layer1、Liera等设施，其中Aptos是从量级、发展、匹配程度来看可以说一半领先。\n\nAptos 于今年 2 月 2 日，彼时，曾任 Libra 的开发者和余名成立了 Aptos Lab，并宣布将根据 Libra 的一些现有技术重新开发网络，具体来说，Aptos仍将建立在库基础上，使用 Move 代码编程语言和 Move 的开发环境，并且将采用之后的 Diem-BFT 达成共识。不过，与付出代价的 Libra 不同，的愿景则将聚焦于提高第一层的安全性和可扩展性，打造可以为人们提供服装的基础设施网络。\n\n3 月 1 日投投，Aptos 曾举办过 2 美元的融资策略，2 美元的融资策略，Katie1 领着 Multicoin Capital、三箭资本、FTX Ventures 和 Coinbase Ventures 等机构举办；同月下旬，Apt再次完成该轮的具体信息投向未来实验室，但未来机构包括确定，并且合作伙伴可以与 Binance 合作，并可以与 Binance 建立开发、代码审查和黑客马拉松等方面的基础设施建设。\n\n目前，一款手机的第二个注册空投测试网的第二次空投测试网已经运行良好的运行测试和测试网测试完成了测试，并测试了500个代币的具体情况，每天的测试周期已用于测试周期测试。写过《我和Aptos测试的节点聊聊，发现还难熬的网络炒作》（https://www.odaily.news/post/5180351），其他的读者可以看看。\n\n普通用户，通过 Mar 等终端钱包，建议前往 Apto 市场的 AptoF 项目包括 Apto 的域名化交易所域名服务、Liquidswap、NFT 等。\n\n**隋：20亿美元的新晋独角兽**\n\n日前，由项目团队发起亿亿美元开发团队的Libra项目开发团队正在筹划的项目中，我的十亿美元实验室正在寻求投资20亿美元，以千亿美元将融资 2 亿亿美元承诺提供至少 1.4 美元的资金。Mysten Labs 正是 Sui 的开发团队。\n\n早在去年 11 月，Mysten Labs 就曾完成 3600 万美元 A 轮融资，该轮融资由 a16z 领投，Coinbase Ventures、NFX、Slow Ventures、Scribble Ventures、Samsung NEXT、Lux Capital 等参投。\n\n与 Apto 类似，Sui 语言必然继承了 Libra 的 Move 开发，但 Sui 却在原版本（Core Move）上做了改进（参见：https://sui.io/learn/sui-move-diffs） ，推出专门针对于网络的服务器，新的移动、性和移动版本的基础上对机制地址等进行了更好的交易，从而提高了网络性能的提高水平，提高了网络安全性能。 。\n\n提升性能，通过对交易类型进行分类，隋会针对具有一贯关系的交易的核心问题的核心机制，兑现交易的并行化处理（交易并行化、交易并行化），从而来从始终关系到隋会的核心交易机制网络提升性能。据 Figment Capital 合伙人 Trace 介绍\n\n（参见：https://twitter.com/tracecrypto1/status/1546498909513650177），在 MacBook Pro 上运行 Sui 节点的早期数据显示能力超过 12 万笔 Token 交易。\n\n5 月末，Mysten Lab 发布了 Sui 的经济币模型及激励相关内容，SUI 的总量为 100 枚，将在主网启动时流通，代币剩余的 UI 将在供应商未来为或在包括激励活动分配。用例参与方面，SUI 的用途 PoS 质押、支付费、支持 Sui 经济体系以及参与链上投票等。\n\n本周，为了测试目标的 Chrome 钱包，另外 Mysten Labs 已经发布了用于月宣ui 的官方发布了 Sui 官方发布的“Sui 8 朋友钱包测试网”\n\n**Linera：Libra Gang 背景的另一条 Layer1**\n\n继 Aptos、Sui 之后，Linera 是第三条已公开宣布完成融资的 Libra 背景 Layer1。\n\n6 日，Linera 宣布完成 600 美元轮融资，本轮融资的投投还是 a16z，包括 Cygni Capital、Kima Venture 和 Tribe Capital 等，所筹资金用于将众投机构和投资开发者募集资金等其他员工来共同制造协议。\n\n与另一种源项目相比，Linera 发表的一篇最新的预告片的首期报道，可用于发布的最新消息，可发布的最新消息.com/@linera/introducing-linera-bdb809735552）。\n\n简单来说，Linera 希望制造一个可以使用 web2 应用那样轻松扩展的低延迟区块链，像其 Linera 聚焦在了创始人兼首席执行官 Mathieu Baudet 时的重点研究 Libra 协议和 Zef 之时上通过这个协议，将整个运营商的运营商和运营商运营商之间的运营商快速运营。\n\nLinera 的愿景要推广这种方法，让它很实用，让大多数基础帐户的操作能够在几秒内快速得到确认。\n\n**歌唱：Cosmos 生态的稳定币新野望**\n\n尚比较测试阶段，但可以已经然吸引了市场的广泛关注。\n\n来看一看，Canto 是从一条基于 Cosmos SDK 上不同市场的其他 Layer1 网络，会胡椒粉与其他几个 Layer1 网络，Canto 自带一些 DeFi 组件，例如分叉于 Compound 的分叉功能于 Solidly 的 DEX、以及一个叫作注的全新稳定。\n\n从组合性上来看，这三个 DeFi 组件之间是相相成的关系。注意，市场发行并不直接走薄荷机制，需要通过制定超额生成正常的 ETH、ATOM、CANTO 等资产，辅助其有效锚定需要通过最高市场交易联盟的稳定市场规则，以及 DEX 的联合委员会来共同维护，注意将作为联盟上层（甚至整个 Cosmos 的服务于领导及市场）。\n\nUST暴雷，去市场上出现了一定程度的生态在生态上的表现，NOTE在一定程度上对生态环境进行了集中展示，NOTE一定是在整个市场的视线。如果 UST 也可以直接采用正常的方式复制，就可以像 Layer1 一样正常使用了一而快速打开欢迎。\n\n \n **齿轮：Polkadot 生态最受期待的智能合约链**\n\nCosmos生态有Canto，Polkadot生态也期待值非常高的Layer1 Gear。\n\n去年 12 月，基于 Polkadot 的智能合约投Gear 宣布完成 1200 万美元融资，本轮融资由 Blockchange 领投，Three Arrows Capital、Lemniscap、Distributed Global、Polkadot 创始人 Gavin Wood 等参参。\n\nGear 是支持 WebAssembly 的一条（SM）的合约，待成功拍下高级平行链插槽并接入后，开发者将能够在 5 分钟内以最简单、最有效的方式将其 Dapps 部署到 Gear，即进入波卡大生态内。\n\n就技术特点而言，从包括但不支持以下几种不同特性的开发者的语言，例如 Rust、C++ 等，将大大降低一系列、C++ 等不同类型的开发者的语言。入门窗帘，为行业带来的好处二是当应用程序在浏览器中运行时，WebAssembly 的程序运行速度快，以用户的实际体验；第三点关于智能合约的沟通，耳机使用采用演员模型，这种类型的设计上是可分片的，可并行的，开发者可以在模型上进行异步编程，演示模型的允许处理效果，真正意义上的各种不同业务，基于 Gear 的不同业务逻辑 Dapps 可以高速运行。\n\n**Celestia：让Celo甘愿降级作“绿叶”的Layer1**\n\nCelestia 的前世名叫做 LazyLedger，虽然这两个名字可能都不是很复杂，但你可能对这件事有过某种印象。\n\n一个是去年 Polygon 推出通用可扩展数据可用性层 Avail 时，Celestia 的联合创始人 Mustafa Al-Bassam 曾发声讨论 Avail 的介绍几乎逐字复制了他在 2019 年写的 Celestia 介绍。\n\n二是今年 4 月，Celo 财库组织 Ocelot 文表示，计划更改其公链发展路线图，将 Layer1 架构转换为在 Celestia 之外的 Layer2 Rollup，使用 Celestia 网络实现共享性和数据有效性的方法，而不再承担验证者和共识问题的责任。\n\nCelestia的第1层，该是链上的首个“特殊区块链”。交易层进行解耦，其本身作为共识层将只承担交易层的划分和数据验证工作，具体的执行则将至其他至连接层的交易执行网络（如Celo）除外。\n\n采用链构架，可实现链结构，并实现共识“层级共识”的多层次结构来实现多个链表链的扩展性、希望和互操作性”。\n\n路线图显示计划，Celestia 于 2022 年启动测试网，并在 2023 年逐步启动激励测试网以及主网，其开发团队也已确认会用于 PoS 质押的发布。\n\n然而，因此，Celestia 在架构上因此与 Polka 的“多条链+平行链”的存在一定相似，而原本构筑的链架构路径看起来好像是那么如人意，待 Celestia 上线时可以正常运行实际观察待观察。\n\n \n **Aleo：四年磨一剑的隐私龙头**\n\n真的很详细，Aleo 团队在 2019 年开始开发并没有什么新项目，在 2019 年左右完成了它的框架项目，2800 年左右完成了 2800 年 2021 年融资，a16z 领投，Placeholder VC、Galaxy Digital、Variant Fund、Coinbase Ventures、Ethereal Ventures、Polychain Capital、Slow Ventures、Dekrypt Capital、Scalar Capital、Zero Knowledge Validator、Coinbase 前首席技术官 Balaji Srinivasan 等参投。\n\n今年2月，Aleo又完成了2亿美元的B轮融资，SoftBank、Kora Management领投，a16z继续跟投、Tiger Global、Samsung Ventures等参投。\n\nAleo 的定位是合约的隐私类型 Layer1，其核心技术是 Zexe 和 Leo 核心板块，Zexe 同意两个协议在 ZeroCash 原有的 zks 技术上进行改进，也可以加密的令牌交易，可以应用生态平台的编程语言，Leo 作为 Aleo 的编程语言，可以将 Zexe 共识协议的 zk-s 设置讨论，任何在 Aleo 平台上支持的 Dapp 都可以使用 zk-s 交易。\n\n值得一提的是，Aleo 第一季度曾游区块链游戏平台 去年这一年有 9 亿美元（亿美元）合作，将携手 Aleo 的解决方案将零知识证明带入链中。\n\n测试测试完成后，Aleo 将在主网发布阶段，其代代也将同步进入，待Aleo 测试第三代测试网已披露其将采用减半式的代币模型。\n\n**Anoma：支持任意资产自由交换的隐私网络**\n\nAnoma 是力强风投 Polychain Capital 推的隐私型 PoS 公链。\n\n去年4月，Anoma完成了首轮675万美元融资，Polychain Capital领投，Electric Capital、Coinbase Ventures、FBG Capital、CMS

"加密世界已然浮现多起，伴随着这个行业的熊熊轮回，也伴随着混乱的生机。项目的“兴衰”持续进化、生长。\n\n上一天的大牛市中，再一次是我们到了Layer1、Berana、街头的大价值。城市的价值发展迅速，年轻人迅速发展成熟，各种高速增长的同时应用，在链上也发现了基础市场的价值。\n\n时过这些日子，历经数月的洗礼，第一层中的大多数项目都表现出第一层的情况，然而，在过去的一段时间里，却一直过往的环境中，仍然拥有相当强的白日牛市），结合“每一轮的轮回、项目都将诞生于上一轮高亮的城市”的历史，此时开发阶段我们更应该把时间投射到更早的时候尚早的全新Layer1们。\n\n业内人士看来，“熊市级，牛市级”的目前来看，综合一级市场动态来看，新一代Layer1即将成为新机构的聚焦点，Aptos、Sui等明星项目都即将完成完成数亿美元等级的融资。\n\n为了帮助大家清楚地捕捉到Layer1O赛场的最新发展趋势，每日星球从近半年内走入大众视野且尚未发币的新兴Layer1入选中榜10家较具代表性的项目，项目组等，我们真正的应用情况、亮点、最新进展未来手机对Layer1进行\n\n提前说明是，但只是某个组中需要出现的项目均基于融资情况、始创背景、市场热度等因素筛选而出，保证项目最终能够以较早的阶段完成项目，因此无法如期顺利完成发展，并成功打开市场，因此不组合投资建议。\n\n**Aptos： 最强势的新生代 Layer1**\n\n2019 年，Facebook 联合圈内与其他机构共同改名了大声大片（最近公布了天秤座监管的启动区块，以方便阅读各个方面的项目统一使用天秤座）。尽管如此，天秤座最终压力落了个胎腹中，但该死的中心其实就职于 Libra 去开发者却继承了项目的一些开发成果（比如移动开发者以另一种方式去换取）是的全新 Layer1 项目。\n\n目前，已公开于零售设备设施的Layer1、Liera等设施，其中Aptos是从量级、发展、匹配程度来看可以说一半领先。\n\nAptos 于今年 2 月 2 日，彼时，曾任 Libra 的开发者和余名成立了 Aptos Lab，并宣布将根据 Libra 的一些现有技术重新开发网络，具体来说，Aptos仍将建立在库基础上，使用 Move 代码编程语言和 Move 的开发环境，并且将采用之后的 Diem-BFT 达成共识。不过，与付出代价的 Libra 不同，的愿景则将聚焦于提高第一层的安全性和可扩展性，打造可以为人们提供服装的基础设施网络。\n\n3 月 1 日投投，Aptos 曾举办过 2 美元的融资策略，2 美元的融资策略，Katie1 领着 Multicoin Capital、三箭资本、FTX Ventures 和 Coinbase Ventures 等机构举办；同月下旬，Apt再次完成该轮的具体信息投向未来实验室，但未来机构包括确定，并且合作伙伴可以与 Binance 合作，并可以与 Binance 建立开发、代码审查和黑客马拉松等方面的基础设施建设。\n\n目前，一款手机的第二个注册空投测试网的第二次空投测试网已经运行良好的运行测试和测试网测试完成了测试，并测试了500个代币的具体情况，每天的测试周期已用于测试周期测试。写过《我和Aptos测试的节点聊聊，发现还难熬的网络炒作》https://www.odaily.news/post/5180351\n\n普通用户，通过 Mar 等终端钱包，建议前往 Apto 市场的 AptoF 项目包括 Apto 的域名化交易所域名服务、Liquidswap、NFT 等。\n\n**隋：20亿美元的新晋独角兽**\n\n日前，由项目团队发起亿亿美元开发团队的Libra项目开发团队正在筹划的项目中，我的十亿美元实验室正在寻求投资20亿美元，以千亿美元将融资 2 亿亿美元承诺提供至少 1.4 美元的资金。Mysten Labs 正是 Sui 的开发团队。\n\n早在去年 11 月，Mysten Labs 就曾完成 3600 万美元 A 轮融资，该轮融资由 a16z 领投，Coinbase Ventures、NFX、Slow Ventures、Scribble Ventures、Samsung NEXT、Lux Capital 等参投。\n\n与 Apto 类似，Sui 语言必然继承了 Libra 的 Move 开发，但 Sui 却在原版本（Core Move）上做了改进（参见：https://sui.io/learn/sui-move-diffs） ，推出专门针对于网络的服务器，新的移动、性和移动版本的基础上对机制地址等进行了更好的交易，从而提高了网络性能的提高水平，提高了网络安全性能。 。\n\n提升性能，通过对交易类型进行分类，隋会针对具有一贯关系的交易的核心问题的核心机制，兑现交易的并行化处理（交易并行化、交易并行化），从而来从始终关系到隋会的核心交易机制网络提升性能。据 Figment Capital 合伙人 Trace 介绍\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tracecrypto1/status/1546498909513650177\n\nMacBook Pro 上运行 Sui 节点的早期数据显示能力超过 12 万笔 Token 交易。\n\n5 月末，Mysten Lab 发布了 Sui 的经济币模型及激励相关内容，SUI 的总量为 100 枚，将在主网启动时流通，代币剩余的 UI 将在供应商未来为或在包括激励活动分配。用例参与方面，SUI 的用途 PoS 质押、支付费、支持 Sui 经济体系以及参与链上投票等。\n\n本周，为了测试目标的 Chrome 钱包，另外 Mysten Labs 已经发布了用于月宣ui 的官方发布了 Sui 官方发布的“Sui 8 朋友钱包测试网”\n\n**Linera：Libra Gang 背景的另一条 Layer1**\n\n继 Aptos、Sui 之后，Linera 是第三条已公开宣布完成融资的 Libra 背景 Layer1。\n\n6 日，Linera 宣布完成 600 美元轮融资，本轮融资的投投还是 a16z，包括 Cygni Capital、Kima Venture 和 Tribe Capital 等，所筹资金用于将众投机构和投资开发者募集资金等其他员工来共同制造协议。\n\n与另一种源项目相比，Linera 发表的一篇最新的预告片的首期报道，可用于发布的最新消息，可发布的最新消息.com/@linera/introducing-linera-bdb809735552）。\n\n简单来说，Linera 希望制造一个可以使用 web2 应用那样轻松扩展的低延迟区块链，像其 Linera 聚焦在了创始人兼首席执行官 Mathieu Baudet 时的重点研究 Libra 协议和 Zef 之时上通过这个协议，将整个运营商的运营商和运营商运营商之间的运营商快速运营。\n\nLinera 的愿景要推广这种方法，让它很实用，让大多数基础帐户的操作能够在几秒内快速得到确认。\n\n**歌唱：Cosmos 生态的稳定币新野望**\n\n尚比较测试阶段，但可以已经然吸引了市场的广泛关注。\n\n来看一看，Canto 是从一条基于 Cosmos SDK 上不同市场的其他 Layer1 网络，会胡椒粉与其他几个 Layer1 网络，Canto 自带一些 DeFi 组件，例如分叉于 Compound 的分叉功能于 Solidly 的 DEX、以及一个叫作注的全新稳定。\n\n从组合性上来看，这三个 DeFi 组件之间是相相成的关系。注意，市场发行并不直接走薄荷机制，需要通过制定超额生成正常的 ETH、ATOM、CANTO 等资产，辅助其有效锚定需要通过最高市场交易联盟的稳定市场规则，以及 DEX 的联合委员会来共同维护，注意将作为联盟上层（甚至整个 Cosmos 的服务于领导及市场）。\n\nUST暴雷，去市场上出现了一定程度的生态在生态上的表现，NOTE在一定程度上对生态环境进行了集中展示，NOTE一定是在整个市场的视线。如果 UST 也可以直接采用正常的方式复制，就可以像 Layer1 一样正常使用了一而快速打开欢迎。\n\n**齿轮：Polkadot 生态最受期待的智能合约链**\n\nCosmos生态有Canto，Polkadot生态也期待值非常高的Layer1 Gear。\n\n去年 12 月，基于 Polkadot 的智能合约投Gear 宣布完成 1200 万美元融资，本轮融资由 Blockchange 领投，Three Arrows Capital、Lemniscap、Distributed Global、Polkadot 创始人 Gavin Wood 等参参。\n\nGear 是支持 WebAssembly 的一条（SM）的合约，待成功拍下高级平行链插槽并接入后，开发者将能够在 5 分钟内以最简单、最有效的方式将其 Dapps 部署到 Gear，即进入波卡大生态内。\n\n就技术特点而言，从包括但不支持以下几种不同特性的开发者的语言，例如 Rust、C++ 等，将大大降低一系列、C++ 等不同类型的开发者的语言。入门窗帘，为行业带来的好处二是当应用程序在浏览器中运行时，WebAssembly 的程序运行速度快，以用户的实际体验；第三点关于智能合约的沟通，耳机使用采用演员模型，这种类型的设计上是可分片的，可并行的，开发者可以在模型上进行异步编程，演示模型的允许处理效果，真正意义上的各种不同业务，基于 Gear 的不同业务逻辑 Dapps 可以高速运行。\n\n**Celestia：让Celo甘愿降级作“绿叶”的Layer1**\n\nCelestia 的前世名叫做 LazyLedger，虽然这两个名字可能都不是很复杂，但你可能对这件事有过某种印象。\n\n一个是去年 Polygon 推出通用可扩展数据可用性层 Avail 时，Celestia 的联合创始人 Mustafa Al-Bassam 曾发声讨论 Avail 的介绍几乎逐字复制了他在 2019 年写的 Celestia 介绍。\n\n二是今年 4 月，Celo 财库组织 Ocelot 文表示，计划更改其公链发展路线图，将 Layer1 架构转换为在 Celestia 之外的 Layer2 Rollup，使用 Celestia 网络实现共享性和数据有效性的方法，而不再承担验证者和共识问题的责任。\n\nCelestia的第1层，该是链上的首个“特殊区块链”。交易层进行解耦，其本身作为共识层将只承担交易层的划分和数据验证工作，具体的执行则将至其他至连接层的交易执行网络（如Celo）除外。\n\n采用链构架，可实现链结构，并实现共识“层级共识”的多层次结构来实现多个链表链的扩展性、希望和互操作性”。\n\n路线图显示计划，Celestia 于 2022 年启动测试网，并在 2023 年逐步启动激励测试网以及主网，其开发团队也已确认会用于 PoS 质押的发布。\n\n然而，因此，Celestia 在架构上因此与 Polka 的“多条链+平行链”的存在一定相似，而原本构筑的链架构路径看起来好像是那么如人意，待 Celestia 上线时可以正常运行实际观察待观察。\n\n**Aleo：四年磨一剑的隐私龙头**\n\n真的很详细，Aleo 团队在 2019 年开始开发并没有什么新项目，在 2019 年左右完成了它的框架项目，2800 年左右完成了 2800 年 2021 年融资，a16z 领投，Placeholder VC、Galaxy Digital、Variant Fund、Coinbase Ventures、Ethereal Ventures、Polychain Capital、Slow Ventures、Dekrypt Capital、Scalar Capital、Zero Knowledge Validator、Coinbase 前首席技术官 Balaji Srinivasan 等参投。\n\n今年2月，Aleo又完成了2亿美元的B轮融资，SoftBank、Kora Management领投，a16z继续跟投、Tiger Global、Samsung Ventures等参投。\n\nAleo 的定位是合约的隐私类型 Layer1，其核心技术是 Zexe 和 Leo 核心板块，Zexe 同意两个协议在 ZeroCash 原有的 zks 技术上进行改进，也可以加密的令牌交易，可以应用生态平台的编程语言，Leo 作为 Aleo 的编程语言，可以将 Zexe 共识协议的 zk-s 设置讨论，任何在 Aleo 平台上支持的 Dapp 都可以使用 zk-s 交易。\n\n值得一提的是，Aleo 第一季度曾游区块链游戏平台 去年这一年有 9 亿美元（亿美元）合作，将携手 Aleo 的解决方案将零知识证明带入链中。\n\n测试测试完成后，Aleo 将在主网发布阶段，其代代也将同步进入，待Aleo 测试第三代测试网已披露其将采用减半式的代币模型。\n\n**Anoma：支持任意资产自由交换的隐私网络**\n\nAnoma 是力强风投 Polychain Capital 推的隐私型 PoS 公链。\n\n去年4月，Anoma完成了首轮675万美元融资，Polychain Capital领投，Electric Capital、Coinbase Ventures、FBG Capital、CMS Holdings、Lemniscap、Cygni Labs、Walden Bridge Capital等参投。\n\n同年11月，Anoma再次融资2600万美元，Polychain Capital 继续领投，参投机构Fifth Era、Maven Capital、Zola Capital、Electric Capital、CMCC等。\n\nAnoma 将真正打交道的核心分别是希望物的“隐私权”，该项目还以“为系统提供服务”，并以金融界人士的名义将其交予个人隐私。\n\n“物物”，希望个人在交易中允许任何一种可指代使用的资产交换或支付工具的网络交易，任意选择资产的类别。值得一提这里的任意资产的类别。是可以任意兑换的商品、服务或任何可表示在其价值链上的任何数字、价值的东西，包括通过操作性转移到 Anoma 上的资产、以及稳定币形式的数字货币等。\n\n“隐私”则更好地理解，在 Anoma 中，并为保护隐私保护方保护用户数据，并防止隐私保护方、金额和面额知识加密，并且会利用来保证资金的转移结果。 ，Anoma 的另外一个网络资产在转移时会有一个资产池，每个资产持有一个单独的资产。这样的资产，所有参与者越过，有多个参与者，就在一个巨大的组织之间，产生巨大的影响增加了资产转移数据的隐蔽程度。\n\n**Iron Fish：隐私层成为 Web3 世界的隐私**\n\n「我在这个民族学美国在经典场景基础上，基于原语言出出的一套加密系统，这个希望项目的住所来作为通讯通讯的主题。\n\n去年 11 月，铁鱼轮宣布完成 2770 万美元 A 融资，本轮融资由 a16z 领投，Elad Gil、红杉资本（Sequoia）、Electric Capital、Dylan Field、Alan Howard、Jeff Weiner（领英执行董事长） 、MetaStable、A Capital、Divesh Makan（Iconiq）、Do Kwon（Terra）、Matt Luongo（Keep

为每个链上地址额外配备一个“感谢”（查看密钥），地址持有者可以通过该钥匙其他神圣人权限。\n\n监管机制的解决问题，通过“回应地”，Layer1 Iron Fish 机构在显示状态下将相关的信息显示在下类查看相应地址的详细信息，从而允许维护有必要的隐私保护义务（AML） 。\n\n目前，Iron Fish将继续进行第二轮激励测试网阶段，轮激励测试将持续持续，直到阶段稳定、功能完善，做好全部准备工作。\n\n将通与其他网络桥未来多层链之间的跨链互联，赋予不同的区块链实现目标，提供保护性，其最终愿景是世界的覆盖。\n\n**Monad：Jump 前任理想“热”的扩张容**\n\n4月半时被死（当时Jump一个TerraTrading研究负责人Hon E折），Jeump

NPC、一个可穿戴画廊、直播屏幕和一个射击游戏。请参阅以下活动的亮点：\n\n[https://twitter.com/polygonalmind/status/1550177033069756417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1550177033069756417%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecentraland.org%2Fblog%2Fannouncement%2Fbehind-the-scenes-with-polygonal-mind-creating-successful-experiences-in-decentraland%2F](https://twitter.com/polygonalmind/status/1550177033069756417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1550177033069756417%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecentraland.org%2Fblog%2Fannouncement%2Fbehind-the-scenes-with-polygonal-mind-creating-successful-experiences-in-decentraland%2F)\n\n随着元宇宙与主流越来越多的交集，每天都会发现新的用例、品牌和社区开始意识到 Web3 带来的潜力。像 Decentraland 这样的平台为社区发展、外展、参与和推广提供了新的、令人耳目一新的机会。但是，由于元宇宙对许多人来说仍然非常新颖且陌生，因此感兴趣的各方可能不知道该从哪里开始。这就是像 Polygonal Mind 这样的开发工作室能提供服务的地方。\n\n除了为品牌和社区创造新的机会之外，元宇宙还开辟了一个全新的职业路线，以提供使这些机会成为现实的熟练劳动力，并就什么在元宇宙中最适合提供内部人士的建议。原本为程序员和 Web3 爱好者的个人已经成为元宇宙建设者、体验开发者、可穿戴设计师、活动策划者、LAND 所有者等等。作为一家成功的工作室，Polygonal Mind 是元宇宙早期的资深人士，而现在已为好一些大品牌开发了许多绝佳体验。\n\n该工作室很乐意回答来自 Decentraland 基金会的一些问题，并与社区分享他们的故事，以及他们的行业观点和建议。一起来了解 Polygonal Mind 的元宇宙体验构建行业的幕后花絮。\n\n### Polygonal Mind 问答\n\n**DCL：当 MTN DEW x NYXL 这个项目找你时，他们是否已经知道他们想要设计和建造什么，或者你是否帮助他们构思了这种体验？如果是，你是如何想出为他们设计的体验的？**\n\n**PM：**这个项目是通过 Mountain Dew 的合作伙伴 NYXL 找到我们的，他们带着明确的愿景和目标来到我们这里，但在视觉方面完全开放。正如我们通常所做的那样，我们开始为他们创建完全不同的概念和草图，直到我们得到一个我们都认为拥有最好的用户体验但也非常适合 Mountain Dew 的品牌战略的概念。\n\nNYXL 一直是一个很好的合作伙伴，让我们能够为他们的空间提供独特而富有创意的一切。我们一起探讨了对 MtnDew 品牌和 NYSubliners 团队等中心主题的不同看法和观点。\n\n**DCL：他们什么时候联系你关于要在 Decentraland 中创建激活的事情？品牌应该提前多长时间寻找创作者？**\n\n**PM：**他们在 5 月中旬联系了我们。我们认为最好在活动安排前 3 个月联系设计/开发工作室。这将有足够的时间来准备整个战略，以确保我们能够完全符合合作伙伴的利益和期望。\n\n**DCL：最近有很多大品牌与你联系，以在虚拟世界中创建激活和体验吗？你觉得元宇宙中激活的潜力是否已经被主流完全实现了？要实现它需要什么？**\n\n**PM：**是的，多个月以来许多大品牌已经与我们进行联系，过去几个月我们的影响力有所增加。我们认为元宇宙中激活的潜力尚未完全实现，但我们确实看到了关注度和出席率的提高。我们致力于大规模采用。我们认为去中心化的元宇宙将继续存在，并且它们将在不久的将来成为常态。但底层技术有待改进；更好的加载时间、更多的集成、更动态的世界、互操作性、更多支持元宇宙的设备、更多的社交联系、增加虚拟身份感觉的改进等。除了技术之外，区块链、元宇宙和 NFT 的主要愿景需要正常化，这是我们认为只有时间才能解决的问题。\n\n**DCL：您认为使用此类活动和体验来推广品牌或社区的潜力和好处是什么？您认为它与传统的促销方式相比如何？**\n\n**PM：**元宇宙开辟了品牌及其社区之间参与的新方式。它比其他传统的广告方式更具沉浸感、吸引力和乐趣。如果我们将其与区块链相结合，我们将获得更多新的方式来与我们的观众互动而达到一个新的水平，他们不再被视为个人客户，而是作为一个整体社区，人们可以通过多种方式参与，例如投票或拥有品牌的数字产品可以为他们带来一些其它方式无法获得的好处和额外奖励。\n\n**DCL：你在 Decentraland 为品牌设计和创造什么样的体验？**\n\n**PM：**嗯，像这样的项目有很多阶段。根据客户及其对Web3/元宇宙的了解，项目在预生产阶段可能比实际生产阶段花费更多的时间。我们通常从一些咨询会议开始，在那里我们分享我们关于 Web3 和元宇宙激活的知识和专业知识，然后我们进入预生产阶段，我们为项目建立愿景和目标，确保我们与我们的合作伙伴完全一致，不仅在艺术上，而且从营销/商业的角度来看也是如此。最后我们进入生产阶段，我们不断分享我们的工作进展并在发布前讨论营销策略。\n\n**DCL：是什么让 Decentraland 的体验/激活“很棒”？成功的关键要素是什么？**\n\n**PM：**这种体验必须很有趣，并且与您在真实生活的活动中所习惯的不同。玩游戏、获得酷炫的可穿戴设备以及与其他玩家一起发现令人愉快的品牌时刻，这些都会让人们更快乐，并与品牌的价值观建立更紧密的联系。\n\n**DCL：对于希望在 Decentraland 推广和创造体验的品牌和社区，您有什么建议？**\n\n**PM：**不要专注于销售，而是要创造价值和社区。\n\n**DCL：Decentraland 在活动和激活方面为品牌和社区提供了哪些可能性？**\n\n**PM：**如今，Decentraland 是最开放和最发达的元宇宙平台之一，它可以让任何人创造几乎任何你能想象到的东西。由于它通过区块链本身去中心化，它允许我们实施几个新工具来增强用户体验。其中一些是直播、NFT、可穿戴设备和游戏开发等。\n\n**DCL：对于希望成为 Decentraland 体验设计师和创建者的其他人，你有什么建议？你需要什么样的技能？你的团队需要什么样的人？**\n\n**PM：**我们的第一条建议是在做任何事情之前先花时间在 Decentraland。从其他人正在做什么，他们如何以及为什么这样做以及人们在平台上的本地行为中学习。我们已经看到许多新设计师将大量时间投入到完全脱节的事物上，而社区可以很快看到这一点。至于技能组合，这更难回答。在这一点上，我们的工作室个人需要广泛的技能，因为我们的经验变得非常详细。我们需要 3D 艺术家、游戏开发人员、区块链开发人员、动画师、Web 开发人员等等……但如果你才刚开始，一个有程序员和艺术家的团队就足以在 Decentraland 中制作很酷的东西。\n\n**DCL：你认为这些类型的激活和促销是未来吗？你认为它们将如何随着时间的推移而变化和发展？**\n\n**PM：**是的！与常规广告相比，这些举措对用户而言更具互动性，它们还可以为你提供有关谁对你的品牌感兴趣以及感兴趣程度的直接信息！这样的事情很难预见，就在一年前，我们为 MTN DEW 制作的事件是完全无法概念化的。 Decentraland 几乎每天都在技术层面上发展，同时也在社区层面上发展。新来者带着新想法进入平台，使整个平台旋转以适应他们。实时看到变化是非常令人兴奋的。我们期望的是更丰富的体验，质量胜于数量。\n\n**DCL：Polygonal Mind 的故事是什么？你是怎么走到今天的？你最初是否打算在元宇宙中创造体验？你对你的未来有什么看法？**\n\n**PM：**Polygonal Mind 在八年前作为一个独立的游戏开发工作室开始。我们转型为一家外包工作室，为移动和 VR 行业的游戏开发者提供艺术。我们开发了许多低多边形游戏，如 Morphite，获得了 Apple Store 的艺术奖项，并参与了 Beat Saber 等大型 VR 游戏。\n\n然后，在 2018 年底，就在第二次 LAND 销售之前，我们发现了 Decentraland。我们开始涉足社区，当时社区里大多都是爱好者和程序员，所以我们认为这对我们来说是完美的匹配。作为一家独立的创意工作室，我们觉得我们有机会利用我们的艺术知识帮助建立 Decentraland 的未来。一段时间后，Momus 集体找到了我们，并聘请我们建造了 Momus 公园，这是 Decentraland 有史以来第一个加密艺术画廊，至今仍然是最大的。这在当时是一个巨大的技术挑战，我们需要多次来回才能实现它，因为我们必须与数百个 LAND 合作，这在当时几乎是不可能的。\n\n从那时起，我们一直在 Decentraland 中建造东西，并且我们慢慢地将注意力从游戏行业转移到了元宇宙。到 2020 年底，我们 80% 的收入仅来自 Decentraland 项目。从那时起，我们建立了艺术画廊、游戏、总部、活动区、可穿戴设备以及许多其它疯狂的体验，比如 MegaCube。这是额外的背景信息，至今我们构建了近 4000 个 LAND 的场景，并将我们的工作室从 4 人发展到 50 名团队成员，同时保持独立！\n\n对我们来说，未来充满希望，我们希望继续在 Decentraland 中尽可能多地创造，通过艺术作为让人们进入其中的入口。\n\n**选择您常用的频道加入与我们联系，关注Decentraland(MANA)的最新动态**\n\n**DCL基金会全球社区： \n 【[Official Website](https://decentraland.org)**】 \n 【**[Telegram](https://t.me/decentralandTG)**】 \n

《[网络空间独立宣言](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence)》 的前一年，另一部影响早期互联网政治意识形态的著作出现了：大卫·朗菲尔德（David Ronfeldt） 的 《[部落、制度、市场、网络](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)》（TIMN）。TIMN 报告由兰德（RAND）公司资助。在 “奇爱博士 (Dr. Strangelove) ” 中，兰德公司被黑化模仿为 BLAND 公司。兰德公司成立于 1948 年，是一家非营利性的研究开发智库，负责向美国军方、政府和工业界提供政策信息。因为互联网始于这个军事化的环境，我们也将从这里开始。\n\nTIMN报告创造了一个社会进化的叙事，其中人类通过四种不同的组织形式取得了进步：\n\n![（T）部落有亲属、氏族和血统的社会组织原则。(I) 机构具有等级制的社会组织原则。（M）市场具有竞争交换的社会组织原则。(N)网络具有分层协作交换的社会组织原则。这里的分层指的是无等级、无层次，或能够以多种方式进行等级划分的组织。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fccfc3b17-2054-4305-b705-bd23ec2e5598.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n当新的组织形式随时间演变时，之前的组织形式“在其活动范围内增长，即使该范围已全新定义”，其指出了市场如何增加税收支持制度国家，尽管限制了其对直接经济交换的参与。\n\n![Sam Hart, Laura Lotti, Toby Shorin, Squad Wealth, 2020](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F80498627-0fad-4e56-9afe-848f8f50a539.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n这份报告的制度偏见很明显，比如，它将进步等同于西方的自由民主，而且它对社会进化的叙述可能充其量是简化的。不过，它的论点为去中心化组织有意或无意地，从中汲取政治意识形态提供了历史背景。这在报告中对网络这一最新组织形式的识别上最为明显。\n\n这份报告对网络的定义有点开放式。网络和之前组织形式之间的一个关键区别特征是，网络被描述为**多组织**，强调距离更远的”小的、分散的、自治的” 群体间的协作。这些团体不一定共享一个独特的组织统一体。虽然网络在历史上一直存在，但新的信息技术强调合作关系，通过跨越司法管辖区对机构产生巨大影响，“促进了[企业集团](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu)和其他分布式、网络化的全球企业的增长，以及越来越多的所谓的‘虚拟公司’”，大卫·朗菲尔德表示。然而，多组织网络的主要领域既不是公共部门，也不是私营部门，至少两者仍然是传统的形态。相反，它们将改变第三个领域，即报告中称为公民社会的“自治社会部门”。按照 1995 年的规划，公民社会将包括非政府组织（NGO）、草根组织和私人志愿组织；公民社会通过多组织网络得以加强，并可能解决不平等、官僚主义和普及性等之前组织无法解决的问题。\n\n该报告呈现了一个甜美的网络政治形象：“虽然制度和市场组织形式的发展导致了对竞争优势的强调，多组织网络形式的发展可能会将重点转移到合作优势上”。这种政治表象的背后是非政府组织将在未来十年向全球输出的帝国软实力。对于那些目前在 Web3 工作的人来说，所有这些语言可能感觉很熟悉，尽管这种可疑的意识形态延续通常不会被注意到。通过揭示意识形态的衍变，我们有更大的机会去改变其路线。\n\n报告最后强调了公民社会的三个字母缩写词，即 NGO、NPO 和 PVO，当然，不包含这个在此以后出现的词：DAO。\n\n## 一个嵌合术语\n\nDAO 源于对去中心化技术特性如何改变组织运作方式的想象，去中心化技术特性包括全球数字资产、抗审查和自动化操作。最初被称为[去中心化自治公司](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i-1379644274)（DAC），更通用的术语 DAO出现于以太坊区块链社区。基于维塔利克·布特林（Vitalik Buterin）的“[DAO、DAC、DA 及其他：2014年以来不完整术语指南](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)”，DAO 可以被描述为一个资本化组织，由软件协议来指导其操作，将自动化置于其中心，而人在其边缘。例如，软件协议可以指定组织自动向其成员分配资金的条件。这导致了这样一种想法，即组织价值可以通过代码自动执行，这一影响深远的想法，可能错误地[暗示隐性知识](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)可以在软件协议中充分表达。虽然这个术语有很多假设的想法，但当 DAO 从理论变成实验时，社区很大程度上重新定义了 DAO 这个术语，以表示“不可阻挡的”或抗审查的企业。第一个 DAO，称为 [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization))，已经成为以太坊区块链社区迄今为止最大的事件之一，2016 年它在以太坊筹集了相当于超过1.5亿美元的ETH资金。然而，这个实验被证明是短暂的，因为 The DAO 在推出一个月后被黑客攻击。\n\n与 DAO 相关的更大项目在几年内不会再次获得吸引力。从那时到现在，DAO 偏离了它最初的宗旨，不再继续作为一个嵌合术语，术语及其具体应用都根据其文化背景而变化。市场上的每一次投机活动，尽管充满噪音，但都为 DAO 可以发展的方向提供了新的信号，为实践中的概念带来了描述性、技术性和文化性上的改进。虽然有些人讽刺说，一个分享午餐账单的群体可能是一个 DAO，但为了避免其过度泛化，对 DAO 的关注将仅限于以太坊区块链社区中的例子，尽管在其他[类似协同机制的社区](https://twitter.com/helveticade/status/1400946733249662978)也起到重要作用。2021 年，DAO*可*被描述为符合数字合作主义运行原则的自发组织。作为自发组织，它们是陌生人、朋友或看上去不太可能的盟友以匿名的方式聚集一起，实现共同目标的一种跨司法管辖区的方式，并由代币模型、激励措施和治理提供支持。DAO 的成员可以通过代币拥有其数字资产的代表性所有权，代币通常同时充当治理权和网络效用。\n\n尽管许多 DAO 不会接受数字合作社的标签，但可以说 DAO 将合作主义作为一种*协议*，这意味着一组不断发展的关系实践，这与传统公司结构或去中心化自治公司不同，因为 DAO 优先考虑成员所有权。合作社的标签可以通过数字化来限定，因为今天 DAO 主要是围绕数字资产进行协调。然而，随着DAO概念在实践中发展，其将[不再完全依赖数字领域](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3)。我们将看到， DAO 还引入了新的维度，这些维度超出了数字合作社在概念上所涵盖的范围。\n\n[https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396184123761303554%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgnosisguild.mirror.xyz%2Ft4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q](https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396184123761303554%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgnosisguild.mirror.xyz%2Ft4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)\n\n*//Twitter 文：\n//DAO 不是产品，它们是关于产品或项目的决策框架。\n//如果你的 DAO 成功了，你甚至不应该知道它的存在，它只是一个运营良好的社区。*\n\n去中心化技术生态系统倾向于通过其技术产品来描述一种现象。然而，正如 Furtherfield 和 DECAL 分布式艺术实验室的联合创始人露丝·卡特洛（Ruth Catlow）所指出的那样，“我们需要先构建文化，在构建结构”。虽然以下对 DAO 工具的概述在实践中提供了概念的具体描述，但重要的是要记住，DAO 最终是通过集体网络来协作的。\n\n![DAO 的新手包, 2021](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fb277c810-3d61-4766-979c-af9d8b063e7e.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在其最简单的形式中，DAO 工具被描述为群聊和银行账户。2021年，这通常以 Discord 服务器和 [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/) 的形式出现，后者是一个创建[多签帐户](https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e)的 Web3 平台。多签账户允许多个司法管辖区的匿名团体在几分钟内汇集和管理资金，这种能力远远超过[传统的联合银行账户](https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1399196774967898113)。这种“最小可行” DAO 工具在2021年上半年表现良好，其中包括 PleasrDAO 等项目。\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/pleasrdao?lang=de) 通过集体竞拍艺术家 [pplpleasr](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr) 的 NFT。鉴于数字艺术品拍卖价格的不断上涨，PleasrDAO 背后的想法很简单：一群粉丝集体使用多签帐户，可以汇集资金进行竞拍，并通过共同持有，与其他主要竞标者竞争并赢得拍卖。在赢得他们的第一个同名拍卖会后， PleasrDAO 继续收集其他作品，如爱德华·斯诺登（Edward Snowden）的支持独立媒体的慈善拍卖 NFT 作品“[Stay Free](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437)”，当时共计 220,0 ETH 或价值 540 万美元。他们多次成功的经历意味着，在作为收集者的同时，PleasrDAO 将[扩大他们的范围](https://decrypt.co/66933/why-this-dao-bought-snowden-nft)，开始孵化他们的社区项目。像PleasrDAO这样的活动最有希望通过扩大成员来挑战机构收藏家，邀请PleasrDAO收藏的作品的艺术家，比如plplpleasr，反过来成为这个团体的成员。然而，要做到这一点，至关重要的是，所有权仍然是集体的，而不是机构化的。\n\n![由 PleasrDAO 拥有的 Gnosis 安全多签名帐户，他们共同持有收藏的 NFT。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fc9904c31-747e-4b83-aee1-0a2208b1f338.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n尽管群聊和多签帐户可能足以启动 DAO 的任务，但代币往往成为拥抱数字合作社原则的下一步骤。例如，PleasrDAO 发行了 $PEEPS，这是一个内部分发的代币，代表成员在收藏品中的权益，他们正在考虑将其上市，以拆分其收藏品的所有权。类似的实验，如 [PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=de) 启用了一种代币，其中 $PARTY 代币表示群聊的成员资格、治理权限和由 DAO 管理的生产价值的共同所有权。值得注意的是，PleasrDAO 和 PartyDAO 不是扁平层级结构，因为它们都选择了一组个人来管理它们的多签帐户金库。虽然 PleasrDAO 和 PartyDAO 最初专注于短期任务，但他们都在朝着长期愿景发展，即作为收藏家、投资者和孵化器，使用代币来代表体现数字合作精神的共同所有权。代币化为未来的网络创造了机遇和挑战。\n\n### 合作社运动的新维度\n\n回到它们的起源，今天的 DAO 与 The DAO 的相似之处，主要在于它们强调开放参与和经济价值创造，而它们的文化则更多地转向了特定的利基和社会联系。在上面的例子中，有一个术语有意含糊不清：治理。今天，许多 DAO 使用轻量级的 Snapshot 平台进行治理。在 [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) 上，每个 DAO 都有一个空间来创建项目并对项目进行投票。例如，[PleasrDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/pleasrdao.eth) 和   [PartyDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/partydao.eth) 都有一个 Snapshot 空间，在这个空间上他们对集体决策进行公开投票。 Snapsho 根据一个地址持有的 DAO 特有代币的数量对投票实施权重，如 PleasrDAO 中的 $PEEPS 代币。\n\n![PleasrDAO 的 Snapshot 空间显示了关于是否买入 Dreaming at Dusk NFT 以使 Tor 项目受益的投票。 投票以396,690 $PEEPS 代币的赞成票达成通过。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Ff09da5e4-c7e9-4dd4-b736-f6a504f02606.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在加密生态系统中，[治理的话题](https://technosphere-magazine.hkw.de/p/The-Byzantine-Generalization-Problem-Subtle-Strategy-in-the-Context-of-Blockchain-Governance-8UNNcM8VShTpBGWRuob1GP)有其自身的历史，这里不进行全面阐述。特别是 [MolochDAO](https://www.molochdao.com/) 项目，它使用经典字体 Papyrus 并大量参考游戏公会，在 The DAO 被黑客攻击后重新点燃去中心化治理的火焰。MolochDAO 激发了一大批新的

[DAOstack](https://daostack.io/) 还在继续为 DAO 开发平台，[Block Science](https://block.science/) 和 [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/) 等模块化项目不断出现。这些项目提供了支持多种[治理机制](https://blog.gnosis.pm/a-brief-discussion-of-the-protocol-governing-the-dxdao-7331407a2555)的 DAO 工具。然而，如果不涵盖其较少提及的同平台合作主义的关系，DAO 的史前史也是不完整的。\n\n基于数十年的共同倡议，Trebor Scholz 创造的“平台合作主义”一词以及 Nathan Schneider 概述的 “[交予社区治理](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73)（Exit to community）” 概念，通过 Jesse Walden 的 “[所有权经济](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/)” 等文章与加密领域产生了交集。这些口号提倡由用户社区拥有、开发和管理的平台。具体来说，“交予社区治理“的概念通过明确阐述公司发展所有权的第三条途径影响了去中心化治理。\n\n![Nathan Schneider，创业公司需要一个新的选择：退出社区，2019](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fd14efc42-4c3c-4e7b-a6c9-b760a118e7c5.jpeg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n“交予社区治理”这一概念在实践中，通过一些项目不断发展，比如 [DXdao](https://twitter.com/dxdao_?lang=de)，该项目启动的目的是赋予社区所有权、治理和软件协议的价值。今天，有许多去中心化的金融软件协议通过 DAO 指导其开发，很明显，软件协议既可以退出社区，也可以[与社区一起构建](https://twitter.com/VENTURE_DAO/status/1395544596550062080)。由于 DAO 使用早期阶段的软件工具，因此它们的第一个用户和用例将涉及数字资产（如软件协议）的治理，这是有意义的。 DAO 在数字领域的主导地位或许是它们与早期合作社运动相似之处常常被忽视的一个原因。\n\n今天，国际合作社联盟（ICA）将合作社定义为“个人自愿联合的自治团体，通过共同拥有和民主控制的企业来满足共同的经济、社会和文化需求和愿望”。合作社也可以由其法律实体的结构来界定，这种结构规定合作社是由其成员而不是股东所有的公司。1844年，一个纺织协会制定了《[罗奇代尔原则](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles)》（Rochdale Principles），标志着合作社历史上的一个关键时刻。国际合作社联盟采纳了这些运作原则，这些原则仍然指导着全球的合作社：\n\n1. 自愿及开放的会员资格\n2. 成员民主控制\n3. 成员经济参与\n4. 自治和独立\n5. 教育、培训和信息\n6. 合作社之间的合作\n7. 关心社区\n\n虽然这些操作原则在过去的两个世纪中不断发展，但今天的一些 DAO 可以很容易地制定这些运行原则。自愿和开放会员资格、成员经济参与和关注社区的原则可以转化为上述 DAO 的例子。自治、独立和合作社之间的合作原则是 DAO 作为多组织网络蓬勃发展的关键，通过跨 DAO 协作加强自治社会部门的建设。\n\nDAO 可以围绕成员民主控制设定更深思熟虑的规范，合作社通常将其定义为一个成员一票。大多数 DAO 使用代币投票，即一个代币一票。DAO 的理由是代币所有权代表利益相关者，代币模型通常在经济上直接与 DAO 联系在一起，例如通过对它所拥有的软件协议收费。这使得拥有更大经济利益的 DAO 成员相应地具有更大的影响力。代币投票并不直接违背合作社原则，因为有些合作社会根据质量（如产量）来权重投票。某些情况下，这可能感觉合适，但随着一些 DAO 朝着维护基本基础设施的方向发展，这种不平等显然变得不可取。在某种程度上，这是因为并非所有的利益相关者都具有代表其利益的购买力，他们的实践知识可能被排除在治理之外。这应该通过将文化渗透更多的决策机制来解决，这种[决策机制将经济利益与治理权利脱钩](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html)。\n\n在此之前，诸如 Tornado Cash 隐私协议等项目，已经通过向之前的用户追溯分发代币来解决这个分配问题，从而使用户成为协议的利益相关者。[Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) 项目是一个生态系统服务的公共区块链项目，该项目采取了另一种方法来解决这个分配问题。他们将30%的代币预留给土地管理员、气候科学家以及再生土地管理的其他利益相关者，形成了参与网络治理的[社区 DAO](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3)。由于代币可以比传统的公司权益、成员资格或股份更容易分发，这为一种新的代币持有者公司形式创造了可能性，它可以在治理中纳入更深入的实践知识，而不增加运营交易成本。具有实践知识或[“隐性”知识](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)的利益相关者，就像 Regen Network 案例中的土地管理员一样，通过在决策中融入非正式实践，使治理受益。在这里， DAO 开始引入新的维度，这些维度超出了数字合作社概念上所涵盖的操作原则。出于这个原因，应该像重视决策机制一样，将更多的创新和重点放在识别更广泛的利益相关者参与的代币分发机制上。\n\n在线社区的代币化可能是一个长期争论的主题。代币化并不是解决 web 2.0 社交媒介困境的最佳答案，而是引入了更多的金融化关系意识。作为一颗指路星，web3 应用程序的目标是在关系中引入价值（这在历史上曾被否认），例如劳动和环境的关系而非创建新的财务关系。这种情况下，对于以创造经济价值为使命的 DAO ，代币在三个方面成为一种有用的机制：\n\n1. 启动融资\n2. 分配治理权\n3. 协调 DAO 的生态系统\n\n代币化向早期组织引入了强大的*文化*规范：从一开始就期望对其资产实行透明的共同所有权。支付分红的传统公司结构和 DAO 之间的紧张关系持续存在。因为大多数 DAO 通过一种代币来代表治理权利，在某种意义上，代币有能力将合作社原则直接嵌入高度金融化的空间。毫不夸张地说，这是一枚硬币的两个重要方面，因此，不应该忽视代币化。代币可能是解锁所有权经济的一把钥匙，但为了实现这种未来的更公平版本，我们必须现在就参与基于代币的分发、仲裁和治理来打造文化。这一点很重要，因为与合作社的份额不同，许多可当作治理权的代币可以在二级市场上出售。这使得进入组织的条件更容易，但 DAO 可以从合作社对长期主义的强调中学习，通过围绕代币授予、有限的可转让性或更多实验性机制建立更多的文化模式。\n\n就像 DAO 可以从合作社的案例研究中学习一样，在双向交换中， DAO 可以向合作社引入更多形式的去中心化治理。这是 Morshed Mannan 在「[用区块链技术培育工人合作社：殖民地项目的教训](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774)」一书中提出的例子，其中提到合作社经常面临“当实体跨越国界时的协调问题”，在其国际化进程中，“在参与性管理、相互监督和团结方面存在负面趋势”。 DAO 直接解决了合作社面临的困境，如资金、治理和跨司法管辖区的协调。将合作主义作为一种*协议*，而不是作为企业结构， DAO 可以用它们的新词鼓励一种可以超越传统界限的文化空间。\n\n## 公会时代\n\n[https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\nDAO 可能意外地接受了之前的合作社的操作原则，但它们也灵活借鉴其他类型网络文化。他们可以从大型多人在线游戏（MMOs）公会中学到很多东西。\n\n随着角色扮演电脑游戏在 20 世纪 90 年代上线，这意味着大量玩家可以共享一个游戏世界：一个具有各种目标、活动和子情节的环境。早期完整的 MMO 例子包括“领土在线（Realm Online）”、“网络创世纪（Ultima Online）”和“无尽的任务（EverQuest）”，它们催生了“魔兽世界”和“星战前夜（EVE Online）”等经典游戏。在许多例子中，玩家可以自由地在开放游戏世界叙事、情境支持和风险的大方向指导下设定自己的目标，因为这种叙事自由，玩家可以组成团队来完成单人玩家无法达到的共同目标。这些团体通常被称为公会、部落或联盟，参与者从 40 人到 1000 人不等，他们的目标包括击败难啃的敌人或制造有用的工具。\n\n为了实现这些目标，公会中出现了文化模式；有时候游戏世界开发者为公会发行的工具与他们的实际需求之间会出现不匹配。以 “星战前夜”为例，游戏世界开发者为玩家创造了一个创建公司的界面，让玩家能够分发股份。在实践中，这种分配股份的特性很少使用，因为它没有加强现有的文化模式。相反地，使用“星战前夜”的游戏浏览器和数据API，许多公会开发了自己的工具去完成特定的目标。游戏公会和 DAO 之间的相似之处可以在这里体现出来，因为当前的 DAO 浪潮倾向于使用组合工具的组合，例如将 Snapshot 投票平台连接到 Gnosis 安全的多签帐户，而不是过度预测参与者使用的平台。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\n尽管在 “星战前夜 ”中发行公司股票的特殊功能可能还未出现，但游戏公会经常会采用重新分配的经济做法。从 [Varrock](https://runescape.salmoneus.net/archived-projects-and-content/site-content/tips/world-1-trading.html) 到 [gold farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming)，MMO 市场对于去中心化金融的巨大重要性将在后面的文章中讨论，但有一种经济实践可能与 DAO 密切相关：杀龙点数（DKP）。从历史上看，龙是 MMO 中最常见的敌人，DKP 作为公会内部或跨公会的分配系统出现。\n\n由公会执行的复杂而持久的任务，如杀死一条龙，通常被称为团本，其长度从几个小时到几天不等。在团本结束时，被杀死的敌人会掉落游戏中的战利品，公会必须决定如何分配这些战利品。因为公会需要不同且互补的玩家技能，“同样的人再次合作很重要”，公会分配战利品的方式必须让成员觉得公平。随着公会的成熟，它们通常会发展出不同的战利品分配系统，例如从随机分配开始，逐渐向参与程度加权的随机分配发展，最后通过非正式的评分系统（如DKP）实现分配。DKP 是一种私人货币系统，独立于游戏世界中现有的货币，公会成员可以通过参与团本获得这些货币。公会成员可以选择在团本后用这些点数换取战利品。\n\nDKP 最初是由一个公会在1999年为“无尽的任务” 这一 MMO 设计的，[它的实践](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points)已经被许多游戏世界中的许多公会所采纳，尽管略有调整。Ed Castranova 和 Joshua Fairfield 在“[杀龙点数：白皮书概述](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)：Leftovers DKP 系统” 详细介绍了一个例子，它最大限度地增加了系统中的参与者数量，而不是绑定在一个特定的公会。正如 Castranova 和 Fairfield 所写的，“事实上，这个组织实际上是群体中最高效的分配机构。如果在（“魔兽世界”服务器） Silver Hand 上有一个应急政府，那就是Leftovers 。” Leftovers DKP 系统针对一些限制应运而生：战利品只能在战斗结束后获得，在“魔兽世界”中，不能在玩家之间转移。Leftovers DKP 系统有一个非正式任命的管理者小组：玩家通过公屏聊天辛苦地设置和维护 DKP 中战利品物品价格的数据库。当掉落战利品时，拥有 DKP 的玩家可以选择用它们购买特定的道具，所有的出价和交易都是公开的。由于是零和机制， LeftoversDKP 系统会将消耗的 DKP 点数平均分配给所有参与团本的其他公会成员。\n\nCastranova 和 Fairfield 指出，DKP 补充现有的游戏世界的货币，为有效配置社会凝聚力，“使时间尽可能（花在这些团本中得不到补偿的时间）转换成物品（在这些团本中获得个人所赢取的战利品）”(22)。特别是在 “魔兽世界” 中，因为战利品不能在玩家之间转移，所以拥有战利品本身也具有强大的信号功能，表明玩家在一段时间内确实参与了团本。这个 DKP 系统早于今天开发中的 DAO 平台的机制，如 Aragon、Colony 和 DAOstack，这些平台都提供了基于成员参与的分配声誉代币的机制，这些成员由于成功的提案、资助或活动而得到奖励：在其他游戏世界中可能被称为团本。这些声誉代币补充了 DAO 平台支持的其他经济系统，例如 DAO 特定的代币或其多签帐户库中的其他资产，通常被用作富豪 “1代币1票”模型的替代模型，是通过参与而不是购买力获得，这样，给 DAO 提供了随时间而积累的更大的投票权。DAO 还可以向 DKP 学习，DKP 作为基于参与的私人货币系统，可以用于其他数字资产，而不仅仅只能是随着时间而积累。\n\n除了有效的分配、情境声誉和信号功能，DKP 系统对 DAO 还有另一个重要意义：通常所有公会都独立于传统法院系统来解决纠纷，尽管这些纠纷涉及昂贵的利益。这与 DAO 工具高度相关，比如 Aragon 的数字司法管辖区或 [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) 的去中心化仲裁服务，旨在提供互联网本地争议解决工具。事实上，DAO 工具常常试图从技术上解决游戏公会已经在文化上改进了几十年的问题，现在可能是 DAO 和游戏公会更紧密地融合他们的实践知识的时候了。\n\n![EVE Online 中一些游戏联盟的公会列，2006](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F5504ac03-20c1-4dba-83a6-efda8d3a4077.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n游戏公会的另一个微妙的文化模式与他们的经济结构有关。正如研究员 Joshua Citarella 所指出，许多 DKP 体系类似于一种市场社会主义形式，在这种形式中，商品是公有的，但由市场分配(23)。Citarella 继续指出，尽管 DKP 系统与市场社会主义相似，而且参与其中的玩家普遍感到快乐，但这些玩家中的许多人显然不会在政治上接受市场社会主义的标签。当一个团体通过一种经济形式进行运作时，“影子经济学”可能是一个恰当的术语，它不会给自己贴上这样的标签：DAO 是合作协议，游戏公会是市场社会主义。这一趋势使得游戏公会等有趣的政治领域未得到充分开发，因为游戏公会通常不需要佩戴它们的旗帜。某种程度上，这可能更像是一个特性而不是 bug ，因为像 DAO 这样的新术语的发明而不是对标准的依赖，在一定程度上激发了他们的热情。\n\n[https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\n尽管这可能会导致忽略它们的史前史，但 DAO 仍然保持着一种强大的模糊性，在这种模糊性中，它们迅速增长的政治野心还没有完全具备熟悉的美学表达。这可以用于几个不同的目的。例如，我们可以想象一个 DAO ，当全球气温上升超过 2 摄氏度时，它的金库就会自毁，就[像 terra0 的 NFT](https://terra0.medium.com/two-degrees-nft-5af1263bfcc)，伴随着一个闪闪发光的、谦逊的吉祥物化身。\n\n这样的 DAO 可能会吸引其他一些人参加，这些人不会被大多数气候项目为人熟知的绿色美学所吸引，DAO 还可能通过创造围绕它的新文化来扩大政治目标的参与。新事物的势头总是对某些事情有利，问题现在变成了——如何培养能够跨越意识形态分歧而打造秘密团结的 DAO。\n\n## 一个新想法诞生了\n\n![事实上，DAO 可能是上图的任何一种形态。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F482156a6-7f32-475a-b467-0e0b8c4648c7.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n虽然去中心化自治组织的全面史前史可以让我们更深入了解过去，但 DAO 的许多支持者对 DAO 对未来的影响有一个核心信念：DAO 可以通过超越现代企业的合作来超越竞争。\n\n20世纪，许多经济学家问，当由市场定价的服务在理论上更有效率时，为什么会出现公司？罗纳德·科斯 （Ronald Coase）在 《[企业的本质](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)》 一书中探讨了这个问题的答案，得出的结论是，市场产生了无法解释的交易成本。这些交易成本，可能来自于价格发现、合同谈判或采用服务，可以通过将服务保留在企业中得以降低。根据这一理论，企业的规模可能有他们不会超过的实际限制，因为最终交易成本会通过部门官僚制等发展而增加。尽管这一理论有许多批评，但 DAO 的前景可以与其相关联： DAO 渴望在扩展时变得更高效(25)。虽然在实践中，这一愿望还远未得到证实，但在某些方面， DAO 承诺通过使用技术治理协议来降低交易成本。回到上面的一个例子，像 Gnosis Safe 这样的 DAO 工具使匿名小组能够在几分钟内跨司法管辖区汇集和管理资金。建立一个传统的联合银行账户可能需要几个月的时间，某些情况下，来自不同司法管辖区的个人不可能共同管理一个银行账户。通过公共区块链的支持，DAO 可以在不增加运营交易成本的情况下，将更深入的实践知识纳入治理：期望随着规模的扩大变得“更高效”。\n\n虽然像 Gnosis Safe 这样的 DAO 工具现已实现了这一点，但总的来说，对无限可伸缩组织的承诺，仍有很长的路要走。通常，即使是 DAO 的承诺也会掩盖它们在实践中的效用。 Jaya Klara Brekke、Kate Beecroft 和 Francesca Pick 在 “[异议协议：管理在线同伴社区的差异](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full)” 中着重介绍了 Genesis DAO 的案例研究，这是一个围绕着 DAOstack 平台的集体。他们写道:\n\n> Genesis DAO 是许多 DAO 共有的独特特性的一个很好的例子，也就是说，它们包含了积极性很高的团队，这些团队围绕一组关于治理的思想而形成的，而不是将治理作为实现某些共同使命的手段。换句话说，它以工具为中心，并专注于一个主要行动：为项目分配资金。陌生人在没有时间建立一致和信任的情况下，立即开始共同做财务决定，这是很罕见的。事实上，这正是像 Genesis DAO 这样项目的承诺：该技术将绕过建立信任关系的需要，这意味着成千上万的人将能够围绕目标、采取行动，甚至作为一个团队一起花钱。\n\n就像上文提到的 “星战前夜” 玩家不使用界面去分发游戏开发者所发行的公司股票一样，我们必须重新考虑以工具为中心的开发，以及工具自动创造有用文化模式的假设。与减少信任关系需求的治理技术协议不同，DAO 可以通过迭代开发高度可组合的工具，来协调不同级别的一致性和信任。最终，DAO 追求的效率可能不是定义为一种经济功能，而是一种“更好的”的治理：一种由[无限游戏](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games)中更深入的实践知识支持的治理。\n\n## DAO 的分层\n\nDAO 不会是某些人想象的那种统一的非层次网络。相反，DAO 在不同级别的一致性和信任之间进行协调。在《[加密网络的所有权](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)》 一书中，Patrick Rawson 认为，对于 DAO 来说，为了实现有意义的工作，“将所有权分配给具有更专门目标的小队式实体，是需要解决的关键长期问题”。这些“小队式实体”是具有信任关系的小型团队，可能与上述例子中的游戏公会不同，它们与 DAO 一起执行价值一致的任务。仔细观察，高效的 DAO 开始表现更像团队网络，就像有 100 个附属合作社的 [MONDRAGON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) 公司网络，而不是从远处看起来松散协调的群体智能。受 Rawson 分析的启发，我们可以大致勾勒出 DAO 的三层：\n\n![](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fe7260512-1458-4aac-bc0a-cbca9d6d532d.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n1. **代币**：根据代币所有权排列的多组织网络\n2. **团队**：由代币所有权代表的团队、公会和小队\n3. **任务**：由代币所有权资助的任务、里程碑和突袭\n\n从这三层中，一个***分层***的网络出现了，这意味着一个组织具有以多种方式进行排列的能力。\n\n![一个例子：在 DAO 中代币，小队和任务在 DAO 的不同网络中被分配，这些都可以通过多种方式排名或分类。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F3aedd8d4-58c2-4273-bc91-3761d7f8a995.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在优先分配所有权的生态系统中，代币鼓励 DAO 网络由其成员管理。代币、小队和任务并不局限于单个 DAO 的准机构边界，但为了可以且能够为了有意义分布化控制网络，应该用多个 DAO 中的代币所有权来表示。一个类似于跨国公司控制网络的生态系统出现了，但重要的是，一个没有单一指挥中心的生态系统，不同信任水平之间的交易成本降低了。正如 Rawson 所写的，“只要集体内存在给定的\\[ DAO 网络\\]内自由循环，就可以再次使用已发现的解决方案。”当我们将 DAO 视为根据代币所有权协调的多组织网络时，DAO 工具的目的不仅是支持一个团队的操作，而且促进多个团队的协作。由 PrimeDAO 资助的 [DAO-to-DAO (D2D) 协作机制](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21)是沿着这些路线进行的最具前瞻性的工作，它可能最终超越传统的 B2B 产品。从潜行模式中出现了一个新的小队式实体，[Gnosis 公会](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de)团队同样强调了 DAO-to-DAO 工具，形成了一个名为 [Zodiac](http://) 的 DAO 工具包。\n\n回顾 DAO 的承诺，他们将更深入的实践知识整合到治理中的潜力，并不意味着每个项目提案中的决策必须涉及越来越多的成员；而是在一个 DAO 的网络，拥有最相关的专业知识的团队可以很容易在整个生态系统进行共享。当我们将 DAO 视为不同团队形成的星座，而不是庞然大物时，DAO 就变成了允许集体记忆自由流动的网络。\n\n## 未来的网络\n\n本文中的 TIMN RAND 报告以一个引人好奇的注解结束。它写道：\n\n> 很多关于为信息时代重新设计组织的文献都关注于生产——提高生产率，或者制造波音 777 喷气式客机之类的新产品。然而，这不是反映了一种挥之不去的工业时代心态吗？生产组织仍然是组织生态的重要组成部分。不过，我们也应该考虑“感官组织”。感官功能与生产功能有很大的不同，需要不同的组织方式，比如，更多的网络连接到办公室边界之外的世界。在未来的几年里，为各种感官组织确定合适的设计，可能会成为创新研究和发展的一个很好的元主题。\n\n这段结语呼应了20世纪媒体理论家马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）时代的流行话题，麦克卢汉强调数字媒体如何影响我们的感官神经系统。如果像 DAO 这样的主要数字网络首先在我们的神经系统上运作，这并不意味着 DAO 不会来重组、重塑和重新分配我们的物质世界。有些人仍然拒绝认真对待以下事：即合作原则、游戏公会以及如 FAO 这样组织的奇怪想象场景，呈现了一种具有合法政治相关性的新兴组织形式。我们现在必须在政治上认真对待它们，这样它们就不会只由数字鸿沟一边的人来塑造。DAO 与 [PAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee) (为美国选举候选人筹集资金的政治行动委员会) 并行时代即将到来。正如市场并没有使国家这一形态过时，而是在削弱一些运作的同时加强其他一些运作，DAO 也为自治社会部门产生的传统政治参与引入了新的形式：[网络联盟](https://1729.com/network-union/)。\n\n![Trust’s Mascot Streams 中的角色, ARB and GVN908, 2021](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Ff59011fe-b6aa-42e6-9344-daab85c5976a.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n为了提醒人们注意嵌合术语在严肃性方面的缺陷，许多人回到了它的误称：DAO 中的“A”不符合自治的含义；而另一些人，比如研究员 [Aude Launay](https://twitter.com/audelau/status/1413731529042321410)，则援引了 DAO 的政治自治精神，而不是技术自治精神。尽管 DAO 这个术语在诗意上仍然是正确的，但我们可以偶尔提出一个替代品：去中心化的化身组织。这样的组织在政治意义上可轻可重。正如台湾诗人兼数字部长 Audrey Tang 所言，“化身政治家”的时代已经到来(28)。化身政治家是代表政治平台进行代表、召集和倡导的[虚拟存在](https://www.virtual-beings-summit.com/)；当自动化增加时，化身政治家甚至可能生成自己的政治平台。一个去中心化的化身组织会意识到即将到来的虚拟时代精神：它可能看起来像[集体管理的生化电子人（赛博格）](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1345110226744184833)，如 [Lil Miquela](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Miquela)，或是由成员塑造的完整环境，如 [Trust 的移动城堡](https://trust.support/)。去中心化的化身组织将共同开发、交互操作游戏世界、引擎或虚拟吉祥物，作为其核心，共同创造其成员组织的文化。\n\n![Jay Springett , 世界运行，指南：关于创造世界和运行世界的思辨性文件](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F6fa40349-2cd0-41c2-8680-ffde9154743b.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n通过学习其史前历史，DAO 可以走向一种组织的融合理论，这意味着融合广泛的文化模式、实践和影响，同时承认其继承的政治偏见的一种理论。为了避免对治理的技术协议盲目崇拜的趋势，去中心化的化身组织必须培养玩家想要居住的引人注目的环境，认识到叙事、美学和共同的目标是他们成功的关键。巴洛写道，让互联网不仅成为交易场所，还要成为关系和思想本身的场所，这些都依赖于这些叙述的深度。就像大型多人在线游戏一样，与其说 DAO 是用于管理的技术协议，不如说是相互交织的高风险游戏世界。\n\n我们应该以大致的共识和运行世界为目标。\n\n*本文是 [@keikreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler?lang=de) 连接加密网络、web3 和游戏的 [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de)

基金、Chamas 和其他形式的 P2P 储蓄或信贷协会等，诸如此类的去中心化加密协议，将成为改写金融关系的先头兵。\n\n这些小队原型是科斯定理发挥作用的例证——即强大的内部协调能力降低了交易成本，让小型团体获得更大的产能和金融机会。\n\n这些点对点团体通常由邻居和朋友组成，其非正式的属性揭示了信任在小队中所发挥的核心作用。无论是同屋室友还是分享 Discord 群组的伙伴，小队允许社会货币和金融资本相互转换，为小型团体创造了机会和韧性，而这些都不可能靠单打独斗实现。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmT-rZoi43q0_tCYZrYRC.png?height=1172&width=2000)\n\n近期发生的一系列事件让个别机构的局限性暴露无遗，小队这种组织形式的韧性成为刚需。新冠大流行是这些社会粘合剂中最新的一个：物理上我们保持距离，情感上我们越发紧密。当疫情来袭时，首要任务是确保小队的安全，协调和决策的需求接踵而至。\n\n但如今群体凝聚力文化的出现，是城市生活中社会和经济动荡双重驱动的结果。那些在同一个屋檐下分担租金的人成了家人。被一线城市排挤的人们抱团取暖，在缺乏社会保障网的失业市场中偷生。\n\n小队既是当代社会原子化的产物，也是对原子化社会的回应。＂去北边搞块地＂的说法，标志着城市年轻居民渴望基于小队的新型农庄。立队为家是现代版的[返土归田运动](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement)——把受「全球概览」启发出现的战后公社，变为后互联网冲浪俱乐部在微博上宣扬共居、生态文化园和太阳能网络等美德。\n\n小队文化是新自由个人主义的对立面。千禧一代正在从几十年的嘲讽中毒症中恢复，重新发现彼此互生的探索性关系是什么样子。有了在「我的世界」、「DOTA 2」和「堡垒之夜」等游戏中组队的经历，年轻一代已经被注入了极其强大的小队能量。\n\n![撇开军事含义不谈，私聊群的出现，迎来了＂小队＂话语权的新时代。（译者：上图显示了“squad”在谷歌 Ngram Viewer 搜索中的上升趋势，关于Ngram Viewer，详见：https://books.google.com/ngrams/info）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B9GQjsGOo6ovhR0ElVST6.png?height=740&width=1437)\n\n不管是为了生存还玩乐而凑到一起，当下的危机催生的小队组织将充满韧性。有了跨越时空的网络空间，距离将不再成为障碍——很快，生机勃勃的文化将由那些胜似亲人的小队成员们担纲演绎。团体合作现已成为强大的默认共识，将小队置于社会、文化和经济生活的中心。借用 K-HOLE 的说法：如今人作为个体出生，不得不去寻找团体归属。\n\n## 小队理论\n\n在古代，人们聚到一起组成小队是为了挣扎求存；而如今，永远在线的群组交流则为小队文化的形成创造了条件。群聊和相应的团队工作空间，创造了共同背景和群体记忆。小队的一个必要条件是这种持续存在感：共存共现。\n\n但小队不止是一个松散的关系网络，它是一个连续体。小队形成的第二个先决条件是自我认同。它不是你或我，而是我们。这个支柱往往紧随第一个支柱。一开始小队可能只是个临时发起的 Telegram 频道，但很快人们口中的＂那个群＂就变成了小队的代名词。\n\n为了实现对自身的整体认知，小队用极强的群体规范来保持边界。去他喵的邓巴数字吧——理想的小队不超过 12 人。超过这个数量的人要真正做到一起协同怎么可能呢？对紧密协调来说，小型群组至关重要。小队可能被更大的网络环绕，使它从外面看上去大且混沌。但是对于核心成员来说，一个无形的圈子限定并保护了群体认同的空间。\n\n随着**小队 VIBE** 的增长，队内成员在社交、情感和财务方面相互依赖和资源共享的可能性也在增加。持续的社会化和不断加深的自我认同带来了相互之间的信赖，成为探索小队共同能力的基础。**小队文化**才刚刚[萌芽](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJ7yW7Y3RY)。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DZby1JkYnXxk7We1dWdxJ.png?height=450&width=640)\n\n## 小队空间\n\n这场新冠大流行翻转了在真实世界里共享空间的剧本，但我们国内的新现状，无非是线上屡见不鲜的模式在物理世界中的翻版。最初人们设想的只是一系列相互链接的文档，到头来 Web2.0 的大规模产品化把互联网变成了一系列相互连接的领地。\n\n今天的小队是数字化群落的体现，崭新的小队时代迫使我们重新思考早期社交网络的个体化逻辑。与超文本的初衷相反，互联网没有成为任由个体穿梭其间的单一万维网（WWW）。如今上网犹如踏进全球竞技场；大众社交媒体成了危机四伏的杀戮地带，没有团队的支持，任何人都无法穿行。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uuPSBgRLyCihb2ZIXQUot.png?height=1476&width=2680)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wQU1oCryRzlUw3JOnseJL.png?height=1452&width=2702)\n\n上面显示的 Twitter 亚文化只是庞大社交深网的一小部分。在这个飘渺的图景之下便是小队空间──数字微文化诞生的内在网络：私聊群、Discord、Slack、Keybase。模因（meme）在小队空间中孕育成型，破茧而出，干翻 [牛肉网](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/) 上的NPC。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5e8taRmTRdBEBk07Otu5g.png?height=497&width=2000)\n\n小队文化是小队空间的下游，而小队栖居的数字场所只会越来越先进。Discord 突然可以一起语音连线了；Keybase 现在也能使用 Git 了。[团队能力取决于工具](https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/)，不同的平台上形成了不同的思想模式。小队空间不仅指环境，它还是一个连续体和共识层。小队空间是策划惊天交易、孕育奇思妙想和涌现 meme 风潮的所在。小队成员可能时空各异，但在这个空间里，每个人的时间都是小队时间。[新建一个私聊群就能开启小队元年](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes/)。\n\n群体动态潮涨潮落无非因势利导，而小队空间就是这一切的核心。生态学把这个过程称为 \"小生境形成\"。网络上，它叫做＂小队文化＂。\n\n## 小队 VIBES\n\n在社交深网的地下洞穴里，我们选中的亲人们发展出自己的文化。小队不需要自己的微货币——图像、艺术、音乐、照片、水帖，还有烤肉，都是原生的交换媒介。小队也同样不太需要内部财务激励。相反，好玩的交换活动产生了信任、互惠和 VIBE——小队最为重视却不可言喻的群体能量。因此，小队生产的核心恰恰正是其自身的生生不息。\n\n加密模因学（memetics）的力量证明，一帮乌合之众有能力在自己晦涩的社会框架中，定义出新的价值形式。meme 制造的＂资产＂无法以传统方式估价，但却能引领文化和经济运动。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-f6kiuBBCd5liHKhmNIUc.png?height=1250&width=2000)\n\nMeme、梗图、黑话、𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼.….. 这些都是只有小队才能搞出来的东西，也是小队制品的主流。它们散发着强大的小队 VIBE，而 VIBE 能勾魂摄魄。外人想要雨露均沾——有时是为了获得社交资本，有时是为了内容的战略价值，归根结底则是因为这股能量有感染力。当私聊群再也容纳不了内心的熊熊火焰之后，一些小队便开始将其社交产品外部化。播客分明是为他们天造地设的趁手工具；快速出版将 meme 变成了白皮书，土生土长的小队幽默像洪水一般席卷了创意市场。\n\n不管是机缘巧合还是事出有因，一旦相聚，小队的创意生产就变得潜力无穷。[VIBE](https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview) 是一点就着的高爆信息弹。在制造 VIBE 的过程中，小队可能会无心插柳地创造出 [去中心化品牌](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/)、虚拟人物和连他们自己也无法掌控的匿名实体。如此这般，驾驭了 vibe 的小队，从年幼懵懂中蜕变，成为创造无尽能量的源泉。\n\n[https://otherinter.net/2020_VIBES.mp4](https://otherinter.net/2020_VIBES.mp4)\n\n## 小队生产\n\n群组认同、共享空间、vibe──这些不仅创造了社交资本，而且加强了小队的组织能力，使交易成本最小化，并带来更大的产能和韧性，这是\"[小队的天性](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)\"。然而，虽然小队可以被看作是一种＂合同关系＂，却与科斯理论中的公司不同，它们没有法律结构。相反，社会契约通过 [相互尊重和内部规范](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/the-vibes-theory-of-organisational-design-937a73f791cd) 等心照不宣的纽带来实现。\n\n但为了维持这种互助经济，小队可能得寻找方法将 vibe 转化为公众可以参与的盈利模式：客户、订阅用户、赞助商、音乐交易、收成等。小队生产从创建流程和交互界面开始，将创造性劳动转化为可由全网用户传播的内容。在这里，小队工具开始发挥作用。在 DAW、Figma 板上或在游戏大厅里产生的 vibe 被转化为文化消费品。然后就轮到发行了。年轻的艺术家们创造了在线画廊和独立厂牌，这些为人熟知的组织模式有助于小队与世界互动（和交易）。Bandcamps、Twitch 页面、DAO 都是可供小队与其信任边界之外的实体互动的公共 API。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qii-UvJ9mWQ2_sL1ikXZa.png?height=1119&width=2000)\n\n一些数字工具是公共接口，而另一些则用于内部协调。如今小队基础设施由简单的软件构件组成：Venmo，Splitwise，Cash App。这些应用帮助小队成员尽最大可能避免向朋友要钱的尴尬，从而成为促进内部协调的金融管道。尽管小队韧性是必需的素质，但社会上素来对于＂一小群人管钱＂持怀疑态度，成了朋友间经济交流的主要障碍。\n\n软件内的预算跟踪、投票和掷硬币等功能，在社会协议和技术解决方案之间提供了一个中间点。例如，要确保 Splitwise 上记录的开支数据准确，很大程度上依靠的是社会规范。而让个人采用一套可追溯的结算规则，就可以降低群体的社会摩擦和协调成本。多一些小队不假思索就能使用的重要功能，可以促进文明的进步。\n\n有些人认为新软件可以解放＂个人创作者＂。但这种想法会不可避免地导致 Uber 化的雇佣劳动者中介平台。我们要解放小队。作为一个社会，我们今天所需要的工具应当以团体为基本用户。然而很少有软件能让小队作为一个整体合作生产并共同创造财富。为了充分实现小队文化，这种情况必须改变。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QVNp86GOuttS7X-MTNf6S.png?height=996&width=1554)\n\n## 小队财富\n\n有了即插即用的新金融工具，小队具备了更好的经济和社会韧性。个人获得复利回报可能机会有限，但群组却能在风险回报曲线上游刃有余。\n\n为小队做贡献是正和游戏，作为回报，成员可以获得更多的机会，对未来的经济状况有所诉求，并得到小队的支持和保障。通过风险共担，一个斗志昂扬的小队更是可以收益倍增，这就是──通往小队财富之路。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7LwTSppT69SevxxSsmNkn.png?height=568&width=1618)\n\n强大的社会结构和正确的技术堆栈将释放新一轮自下而上的经济实验：无息 P2P 借贷、匿名贷款池、集体保险、社会化 ETF、自由职业者 DAO 联盟、轮流储蓄计划、共享收益公会、meme 风投集团、加密庞氏、防诈骗、浏览器挖矿、郊外收益农场、男孩乐队、邪典电影和主权度假基金。\n\n有一点很清楚：如何获得资金和创造资产是关键。小队现在需要的是技术基础设施，以捕获并复合共同生产的价值。\n\n虽然金钱让小队得以维持，但过早地接入金融基础设施会扼杀其活力。 小*队经济主要从非货币形式的价值中收获*。**小队财富** 是每天产出 5 个 meme ，是 e-girls 的假期，是抖音喧嚣的房间，是你的伙伴们在郊区租下的空教堂。**小队财富** 是当 Discord 弹出消息的时候，它带给你的快乐比每周 70 小时的忙碌能换来的还要多。千禧一代都想辞掉工作，跑去创办风险投资公司，而小队已经更进一步，在做其他事情了。\n\n小队对新自由主义 [零工经济 ＂就业＂](https://onezero.medium.com/the-gig-economy-is-failing-say-hello-to-the-hustle-economy-13ae3aa91954) 的承诺和准社会化个人品牌那一套看得门儿清。小队所推崇的个人自决，不是通过个人主义，而是借由集体维护和彼此关怀得以实现。小队重视创造性的表达，但荣耀归于群体更甚于创作者个人。对小队来说，自主性始终带着集体的属性。\n\n*但是，小团体能规模化吗？*小队首先是文化，而不是企业。财富最大化不是他们的主要目标——小队只想让 vibe 继续。稳定的收入本身就是一个值得称道的成就。\n\n相反，通过发明新的美学、组织形式和创意产品，小队能够实现横向拓展，成为其他人的模板。当小队的 vibe 传播时，它们就有了自己的生命。虽然这些模式的物质价值可能有限，但绝不要低估将一个自下而上的新经济模式 meme 化的意义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NYHkLynpLa9D0nPSza2kw.png?height=365&width=495)\n\n在未来的几年里，小队将和公司一样重要。随着我们社会和经济微观结构的变化，强大的 vibe 和可持续性将成为衡量成功的新标准。小队不需要扩大规模，就可以传播大团队的能量。\n\n## 小队大能量\n\n小队大能量到底有多大？小队确实是数字工具加持的一帮伙伴，但它的意义远不止于新聊天软件或在线＂社区平台＂。这是一场运动。小队的领域所包含的，是在日益复杂的世界里，一起学习和创造意义的新方式。小队是由 vibe, meme 和价值观驱动的群体，但不是无意识的蜂群；相反，小队是以自己的方式参与世界运转的原型机构。\n\n**小队是我们重新对价值做出的定义**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AVg6oXVzcSnCmwAcWvTrL.png?height=1000&width=2000)\n\n**小队是一个共享的环境，充盈富饶**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35dUthf_tVuOi_XsAYRgK.png?height=1914&width=3060)\n\n**小队效应让数字网络始料未及……**\n\n**小队是历史终点的终结者**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pv63jRq_fmDx24XrWXAZ1.png?height=1728&width=2868)\n\n**小队有益健康**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/twF-kuFpeDf0lBelPRhIG.png?height=1978&width=3104)\n\n**小队

以此为噱头，为其最具代表性的产品——“高潮”系列唇膏和腮红——推出了系列 NFT。\n\n去年夏天，NARS 与三位女性艺术家（DJ Nina Kravis、Azede Jean-Pierre 和 Sara Shakeel）合作，创作了一套非同质化代币（NFT）。\"这些作品的灵感来自于——高潮，\"NARS 的全球数字战略副总裁 Dina Fierro 说，\"它的灵感来自于概念、生理反应，当然还有产品在感官上带来的灵感\"。\n\n这些 NFT 名为 “Take Me”， “Consume Me” 和 “Captivate Me”。其中一个描绘了一个女人的嘴唇被打开，波浪从中涌出。在另一个中，一种桃红色的液体（“高潮” 系列产品的颜色）有节奏地，诱人地来回涌动。正如 NARS 在其

Crossing）中投放了七款定制设计产品。Fierro 说，在谈到新技术时，传统上，美容和时尚品牌总是 \"在对话中落伍\"，拥抱电子商务和社交媒体的速度很慢。但在元宇宙这方面则不然。\n\n\"我在行业内观察到的是，在元宇宙方面大家是绝不会屈居人后的。” Fierro 说。\n\n现在看来，整个商业世界都是如此，\"进入元宇宙的公司 \"的名单感觉比 \"没有进入元宇宙的公司 \"的名单更长。(元宇宙是一个无法定义的，庞大的数字世界概念，它可以指像 Decentraland 这样基于区块链的世界，也可以是[沃尔玛的增强现实世界](https://www.xrtoday.com/virtual-reality/walmart-targets-metaverse-to-build-future-of-retail/)。)\n\n举几个例子：苏富比拍卖行在 Decentraland 开设了一家[画廊](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/04/sothebys-opens-virtual-replica-of-its-london-galleries-in-decentraland/)。阿迪达斯与 The Bored Ape Yacht Club 合作，推出 \"Into the Metaverse \"NFT。Gucci 在 Roblox（一个用户可以制作游戏的虚拟世界，其玩家有[50%是16岁以下的孩子](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite)）创建了一个艺术装置作品。可口可乐设计了 \"[Friendship NFTs](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/01/17/5-brands-already-boldly-embracing-the-metaverse)\"，是 \"为元宇宙重新设计的\"。酒厂 19 Crimes，将增强现实技术植入产品，当你[扫描酒瓶](https://19crimes.com/pages/living-labels)时，可以看到 \"罪犯 \"在向你讲述一个故事。Balenciaga 将高级时装带入《堡垒之夜》。甚至 [SPACs](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/07/06/what-is-a-spac-your-questions-answered/)（译者注：特殊目的收购公司）也在[进入元宇宙](https://fortune.com/2022/02/04/spacs-metaverse-investing-reutrns-virtual-reality/)。这样的例子不胜枚举。\n\n但在过去的几个月里，有些事情发生了转变。\n\n\"去年，很多\\[公司\\]都是为了公关宣传而做这些事情，你做得越早，你得到的关注就越多，\"专门研究元宇宙的营销顾问 Cathy Hackl 说。\"现在，这种新鲜感已经消失了。你可能会得到短暂的流量，但没什么实质的收益。公司真正关注的是长期发展。\" Hackl 说，公司不再仅仅是涉足元宇宙，而是在 \"审视最全面的元宇宙战略。\"\n\n例如，耐克[提交](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/nike-is-quietly-preparing-for-the-metaverse-.html)了大量与元宇宙相关的商标申请。这家运动鞋制造商，还发布了虚拟材料设计师等与元宇宙有关的职位空缺，成立了一个数字产品创作小组，并收购了 RTFKT（一家加密可穿戴设备工作室）。当微软宣布将斥资 700 亿美元收购一家视频游戏公司时，它说[原因是元宇宙](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/business/microsoft-activision-blizzard.html)。Facebook 现在以两件事而闻名：更名 Meta 进军元宇宙和股价下跌。在苹果 1 月份的财报电话会议上，蒂姆·库克说，元宇宙\"对我们来说非常有趣\"，他指出，苹果在应用商店中有超过 14000 个增强现实套件应用，因此 \"我们看到了这个领域的巨大潜力，并正在进行相应的投资\"。\n\n但这种 \"潜力 \"到底是什么？究竟主流公司希望从中得到什么？答案明显是 \"钱\"，因为 Grayscale [估计](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/25/grayscale-says-metaverse-is-a-trillion-dollar-market-opportunity/)在元宇宙中有 1 万亿美元的市场机会。(Grayscale，即灰度，是 CoinDesk 的母公司 Digital Currency Group 的一个部门；DCG 也是 Decentraland 的重要投资者）。但是，具体是怎么做到呢？Hackl 列举了一些典型要素：宣传、客户获取、客户参与、客户保留，以及——也许是最让人感兴趣的奖励——新的收入来源。\n\n数字服装，数字自行车，在你的 Decentraland 家中，对楼上的浴室进行数字化装修。听起来很疯狂是吗？花 290 万美元买一只数字猿的想法也是如此，但这都是真的。\" Threedium 公司的首席营销官Michael Toner 说：\"我们现在正在进入这个时代，在这里，我们对数字所有权的重视程度，与我们对实体所有权的重视程度相当。“\n\nToner 说，这个数字所有权的世界与我们目前的现实世界并没有什么不同。\n\n\"今天，人们已经习惯于购买数字资产和购买电子书。这对人们来说不是一个奇怪的概念，\" Toner 说，将这一概念扩展到数字 \"手表、小玩意、装饰品和绘画\"，并不需要大费周章。\n\n他说，越来越多的客户希望创建现实世界物体的 \"数字双胞胎\"。例如，在即将举行的[元宇宙时装周](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/what-fashion-week-looks-like-in-the-metaverse)上，你可以直接从 Decentraland 上购买 Hugo Boss 的实体衣服。在 Toner 看来，\"我们正在进入元电子商务时代\"。\n\n**元宇宙中的营销**\n\n如果说数字高潮是一个难做的买卖，那么销售数字啤酒似乎也同样棘手。但在 2020 年，时任百威英博啤酒集团——这家公司拥有百威啤酒、科罗娜啤酒、贝克啤酒以及几乎所有非精酿普通啤酒——全球创新主管的 Lindsey McInerney 却有一种预感，它可能会成功。\n\nLindsey McInerney 不是那种典型的营销主管。她写过一篇关于 20 世纪 70 年代滑板场景的论文，她研究了黑客主义的诞生，她更关心文化而不是公司。然后现实来袭，她才意识到她的 \"文化研究 \"学位没有实际效用。所以她转向了公关，但\"差点被公关学校踢出来\"，因为她的新闻稿中包含了一个（当时还是）新的、不被认可的网站——YouTube——的链接。这在当时是被禁止的，现在则是标准操作。\n\nMcInerney 总是逆向思维，在成为 Web2 社交媒体专家的同时（在社交媒体舆情服务公司 Hootsuite，负责创新），她一直关注着虚拟现实和区块链。当她被百威英博聘用时，你以为她会专注于啤酒、啤酒花和大麦，并没有。McInerney 写了一篇关于 Web3 和元宇宙的论文，这让她的同事感到惊讶，因为她认为这是公司需要了解的 \"地震式转变\"。\n\n\"这就是地震，\" McInerney 说，并重复强调了这一点，\"这比社交媒体要大得多。它和电子商务比则是旗鼓相当，只大不小。\"她说，\"元宇宙和 Web3 的融合正在以我从未感受过的速度发生。从来没有这么快过。\"\n\n作为一个试点项目，McInerney 说服高层领导，为与加密赛马游戏 [Zed Run](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/27/fake-horses-real-bets-unikrn-is-putting-racetrack-nfts-on-ethereum/) 的合作开绿灯。（想想一场虚拟的肯塔基德比）（译者注：肯塔基德比是美国赛马三冠大赛第一关）。McInerney 有信心，公司的优质比尔森啤酒 Stella Artois（译者注：时代啤酒）的品牌形象与 Zed Run 的高端世界完全吻合，她将其描述为 \"元宇宙中最负盛名的游戏\"。百威英博投放了定制的 Stella Artois 皮肤（用于定制游戏角色的外观），拍卖了虚拟马匹，推出了一个新的三维赛马场。这种合作向百威英博多年来的 \"[The Life Artois](https://www.stellaartois.com/en_us/initiatives/the-life-artois/) \"活动致敬，而且主流啤酒品牌首次进入了元宇宙。\n\n结果试点项目取得了爆炸性进展。McInerney 说，该品牌在第一周获得了超过1亿的媒体流量，获得了《[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/18/stella-artois-gallops-into-the-metaverse-with-horse-racing-nfts/?sh=7267b9a57b8b)》和《广告周刊》的报道。她认为这只是未来发展的一个小小缩影。\"这不仅仅是关于电子商务的，\" McInerney 说，\"这也不仅仅是关于你在互联网上销售能力的未来，它是所有板块的未来。”\n\n另一个 \"板块\"：客户奖励计划。这是营销学的基本原理，会员计划中的客户——如常旅客账户——更忠诚，更有利可图。这只是一个开始。\n\n\"我们都知道会员计划有多糟糕，\"阿迪达斯的全球品牌传播经理 Kevin Wright 说，该公司已经大力投入到元宇宙中。\"哦，伙计，它们太糟糕了，糟透了，它们很麻烦。奖励\\[可能\\]是莫名其妙的。它们会过期。\" Wright 澄清说，现在还为时尚早，\"我们还没有搞清楚一切。\"但基于代币的会员计划，有可能提供更好的客户体验——比如说，可以编程，可以做某些事情，或者更容易转换和交换。其他 Web3 专家也同意，例如 Jeremiah Owyang，他最近[给了我这个预测](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/the-social-token-network-rally-friends-with-benefits-and-the-future-of-branding/)：\"品牌将把他们的忠诚度计划积分转化为社交代币\"。\n\n然后，Wright 还发现了元宇宙的一个隐藏优点：它还是一个会计游戏。Wright 说，当公司提供奖励计划时，这些积分为 \"品牌创造了巨大的财务责任\"。就像银行需要手头有充足的现金一样，公司需要抵御一种风险：客户积累的奖励积分——就像常客里程一样——可能爆发式集中兑换的风险。\n\n\"这种情况从未发生过，但如果每个人都想在同一天\\[兑换\\]他们的星巴克免费饮品，星巴克就有麻烦了，\" Wright 说。这就是为什么 \"会计成为了一场噩梦\"。Wright 说，元宇宙中基于代币的会员计划将解决这个令人头痛的财务问题。(确切的机制仍未确定，但这与[德勤报告](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-making-blockchain-real-for-loyalty-rewards-programs.pdf)指出的 \"无人认领的奖励，在公司的资产负债表上被视为负债 \"相吻合，并建议将其用基于区块链的代币替代。） \"我们花了很多时间与产品设计师讨论元宇宙，但我也想与我们的会计师讨论元宇宙，\" Wright 笑着说。\n\n还有其他不那么显而易见的应用场景。安永会计师事务所（原 Ernst & Young 会计师事务所）专注于元宇宙的顾问 Janet Balis 说，虽然大多数最初的案例都是针对 \"B-to-C\"（企业对消费者），但她预测我们将看到更多 B-to-B（企业对企业）的案例。想想在新冠疫情期间有多少贸易展变成了线上的。想想所有的 Zoom 会议。这些活动将来会有许多回到线下，但应该不会全都回去。\n\nBalis 说：\"我确实认为，在 B-to-B 的场景中，有些活动有机会在元宇宙中被办得更好，或者被元宇宙的体验所取代。“(有一家公司已经尝试了通过元宇宙增强体验的方式，CoinDesk，在新冠疫情的高峰期，在 Decentraland 的会议中心开了一次[虚拟大会](https://twitter.com/BitcoinLouie/status/1316740611945439232?s=20&t=KmJZq32fg2CkHUnta97fBA)）。\n\n然后还有公司内部的可能性。Balis 说：”这是一个在更有创意的环境中录用新员工的机会，即使人们在家里工作。“在她为《哈佛商业评论》写的[一篇文章](https://hbr.org/2022/01/how-brands-can-enter-the-metaverse)中（这是主流接受度的另一个信号），Balis 指出，元宇宙可以用来培训未来的外科医生，微软的 \"mesh \"平台在元宇宙式的协作空间中提供了化身，而芯片制造商”[英伟达相信](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/08/10/what-is-the-metaverse/)，投资于制造和物流等方面的元宇宙模拟技术，将减少浪费并加速更优商业解决方案的出现。\" 而现在波音公司正在元宇宙中[设计飞机](https://www.reuters.com/technology/boeing-wants-build-its-next-airplane-metaverse-2021-12-17/)。\n\n我好奇地想知道元宇宙在加密货币泡沫之外的延伸程度，于是我联系了一家传统的咨询公司 Want Branding，该公司与区块链毫无关系——其客户广泛，包括吉列和米高梅度假集团。\"我们与所有不同垂直领域的公司有较高水平的合作，每个人都在思考这个问题，\"该公司的首席营销官 John Downey 说，\"越来越多的客户问我们，从品牌的角度来看，进入元宇宙意味着什么？”\n\n安永会计师事务所也发现了同样的情况。\"我认为对于面向消费者的公司来说，绝大多数会有一个营销或客户体验高管，开始关注元宇宙，\" Balis 说。安永甚至有一个以元宇宙为中心的部门，最近还写了一篇题为 \" CEO 们，是时候进入元宇宙了 \"的[博文](https://www.ey.com/en_in/ceo/ceos-it-is-time-to-enter-the-metaverse)。安永的竞争对手德勤推出了自己的元宇宙商店，[宣布](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-launches-unlimited-reality-services.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:metapr:eng:cons:01132022:building%20a%20metaverse:b:c:kwd-1545562415717&gclid=Cj0KCQiAjc2QBhDgARIsAMc3SqQkNC07bCHfwsnybK00OyGGKEBGcvgghPTS_Yh1Ky-2ObvEnkqHQKkaAl9qEALw_wcB)成立 \"Unlimited Reality（无限现实）\"工作室\"帮助教育、激励、加速和执行客户的元宇宙目标\"。\n\n**敛财与元宇宙**\n\n\"仅仅因为你能做到，并不意味着你应该这样做，\" McInerney 说。\"你的 logo 绝对没有内在的价值，无论你有多爱它，但没有人在乎。\"她想确保百威英博别搞砸，不做任何看起来像抢钱的事情，比如推出 10000 个 NFT 并希望获得神奇的收入，她明白这种诱惑。通过设计的营销推广，几乎总是砸钱的事。它们的成本是硬性的，收益却很模糊。这就是为什么 McInerney 说，许多营销人员现在在想，\"我的天哪！我们不能成为一个成本中心！这可真是太好了！”\n\n只有一个问题，如果它看起来影响不好或贪婪，正如 McInerney 所说，\"没人会再买你的东西。\"\n\n倩碧分享了自己不敛财的经验，它是最早进军元宇宙的美妆品牌之一。倩碧没有销售 NFT ，而是让消费者在 Instagram 上分享正能量的故事（它把这个活动称为 \"MetaOptimist\"）。倩碧向获胜者赠送了 NFT 和 10 年的产品，[比如一位生病的母亲](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW_Vr_Up-b5/)，她每天都带着 \"希望和乐观 \"开始工作，她的儿子正在变得更强大，更聪明。倩碧的全球消费者参与部副总裁 Roxanne Iyer 说，活动的目标是 \"使忠诚度现代化，并推动对品牌的渗透。\"她很高兴的看到搜索量和品牌知名度飙升 20%。\n\n并非每个活动都那么成功。百事可乐的 NFT 发布时，营销部的主管们都担忧其反响。当百事可乐的 twitter 操作发布其 NFT 时，很快 Meta 就回复说：\"这在元宇宙中会很好看。\"百事可乐则回复说：\"还是你懂我，朋友！\" 正如一位品牌专家所说，\"这似乎是不真实的。Web3 对此的反应是，这只是奉承\"。\n\n其他公司还在观望，它们需要更多的数据。\" Balis 说：\"我认为这不只是风险和担忧，而更多的是未回答的问题。法律方面的考虑是什么？税收将如何处理？监管方面正在发生什么？这些都是阿迪达斯不得不解决的问题，这对一个全球品牌来说其实是很棘手的。\n\n\"我们有超过 6 万名员工，\" Wright 说。\"我们是一个庞大的集团，有非常多品牌代表。\" 比方说，阿迪达斯的欧洲足球部门的内部运作方式，可能和美国的足球部门不太一样。\n\n或者考虑一下财务问题。在欧洲，该公司使用欧元，在美国，使用美元，然后元宇宙内的交易手续费需要用代币支付。\"当然，在这种规模下和这么多国家间，情况变得相当复杂，\" Wright 说，\"它的运转一直是非常庞杂的。”\n\n当 NARS 发布“高潮”系列 NFT 时，Fierro 不得不应对各种挑战。\"它们每个都需要一个精雕细琢的生产过程，花费了相当大的时间精力，\" Fierro 说，\"坦率地讲，这需要一定程度的预算和投资，而很多品牌目前还没有分配这种预算和投资\"。\n\n然后，还有一个事实是，元宇宙的概念仍然在不断演化。\n\n\"我们没有看到全方位的公司探索不同用例的原因，是由于规模问题，\" Balis 说，她说的 \"规模 \"是指它还没有完全施展开来，它还是互相割裂的。在 Roblox 中正常的 3D 图像在 Sandbox 中可能无法辨认( Sandbox 是一款移动游戏，而不是字面意义上的沙盒）。\n\n\"有些元宇宙只能通过虚拟现实头戴设备访问“，Balis 说，\"有些元宇宙只能通过台式电脑访问。”有些只支持移动端，有些是中心化的，有些是去中心化的。这事儿得花不少时间去琢磨。\n\n对于阿迪达斯的 Wright 来说，最大的挑战仍然是整体性的对加密货币的怀疑，以及长期以来，对它所包含的许多内容的厌恶——诈骗、投机、跑路。在获得企业的支持方面， Wright 说：\"在 OpenSea 上每发生一个被骗的故事，我们就会失去 10 到 15 个客户。”\n\n从某种意义上说，这与品牌专家通常对品牌的思考方式并没有什么不同。\n\n\"我不认为关于元宇宙的品牌或广告问题与在其他地方有什么不同，\" Balis 说，我们还是问类似的问题，\"这里有我的潜在客户么？这是一个我觉得可以创造优质体验的环境吗？”\n\n其他问题：我能否以一种真实的方式将我的品牌带入生活？我可以用符合我们价值观的方式讲述我的故事吗？正如 Balis 所说，\"一些创意形式将是新的，但我不认为这些问题有什么不同。\"\n\n## 百威英博的奇特酿造\n\n在百威英博，McInerney 铿锵有力地回答了这些问题，然后她确定，是的，将啤酒带入元宇宙确实是有意义的。这最终让我们回到了核心问题上——\"在元宇宙中喝啤酒 \"到底是什么意思，这怎么会不荒唐呢？在欢乐时光，我更喜欢喝生啤，或者是瓶装，罐装也可以，但它不太可能是一张 JPEG 图片。\n\n我把我的困惑告诉了 McInerney ，她给出了一个令人信服的反驳。\n\n她说：\"我不能边喝酒边开车，但你经常看到高速公路上的广告牌，都是酒精广告。或者她会在星期二的中午收到啤酒的广告，\"而我在工作，不能喝酒\"。\n\n她的观点是，是的，虚拟啤酒可能无法与你实际饮用的冰镇饮料相媲美，但也许它比你从传统广告中得到的 \"印象 \"更好。\n\n\"我们可以做得比高速公路上的广告牌，或者比周二中午的啤酒推文广告要好得多，\"已经离开百威英博的 McInerney 说，她现在正在创办自己的聚焦 Web3 和元宇宙的公司。\"我们真的可以给那些想玩品牌的人带来惊喜和快乐。”\n\n而在未来，也许这些啤酒真的可以被饮用。McInerney 建议进行数字和实物的混合体验，也许是在观看赛马的时候。\n\n\"我的设想是，你和我将能够在两个不同的地方各自赛马。\" 她在伦敦，我在丹佛。\"我们可以登录 Zed Run 网站。我们可以选择几场比赛参加。\" 我们分享这种数字体验。我们也可能在元宇宙中去 Decentraland 的 Zed Run 酒吧。\n\n\"我会先买一轮，因为这才对嘛，\"McInerney 说。然后在 20 分钟内， Uber Eats把一瓶真实的啤酒送到我在丹佛的家门口，另一瓶真实的啤酒出现在 McInerney 在伦敦的家。\"我们可以有一个共同的'数字-实物体验'，我们在享受 Stella 啤酒的同时，进行我们的赛马比赛。”\n\n有些人可能认为这个未来是令人兴奋的。有些人则认为它是令人绝望的。但越来越多的公司将其视为完全不同的东西：这是有利可图的。\n\n\n---\n\n原文\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/08/virtual-beers-and-digital-orgasms-welcome-to-the-age-of-metaverse-commerce/](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/08/virtual-beers-and-digital-orgasms-welcome-to-the-age-of-metaverse-commerce/)\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HMdTMO0BJEsmT8JTsmDax.png?height=733&width=600)\n\n",
