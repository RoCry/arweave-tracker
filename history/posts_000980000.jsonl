Qual foi a razão do meu interesse? A necessidade de sentir na pele os preços a subir, o salário estagnado e uma ambição de descobrir a razão e o porquê de ser um afortunado com este presente que é a vida.\n\nSempre gostei de pessoas, de as ouvir mas nunca tive interesse por política ou como o dinheiro funciona, até mesmo o que é o dinheiro, como a razão de o usarmos e o idolatrar todos os dias. No entanto, depois de alguns anos de independência percebi que a falta de interesse de minha parte foi induzida e programada na “folha em branco” desde o nascimento. Na minha opinião, esta folha em branco não está vazia, limpa e pronta para outras pessoas pintarem com as cores e texturas que idealizam. Acredito que quando nascemos a nossa tela já tem cor e desejos, não importa quais são, só sei que não é “branca”. \n\nÉ com este desabafo que tentarei transmitir o que tenho estado a aprender, a informação que tenho consumido sobre as peças do jogo que é a vida.

Adjust Level 2 requirements (long executor)\n  * This proposal is for the Aave community's approval to modify the governance standards (proposition power, quorum vote differential) for Level 2 ideas, which will have an impact on the most important parts of the Aave ecosystem.\n  * From the perspective of the BGD, this is strongly advised because those requirements were established in the past when the AAVE fragmentation was different and because it could result in the creation of an artificial and self-imposed bottleneck to pass proposals that, given their technical nature, shouldn't really face opposition.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe1e42fd73a2d734d78a65e514a6996c785e90bc82a2e896825dd4af003aeec15); \\[BIP-29\\] Introduce GaugeAdder v2\n  * The GaugeAdder is a component of veBAL architecture that securely facilitates the process of adding new gauges to the system. It incorporates checks to make sure that only gauges deployed from authorized gauge makers can be included in the veBAL system and become eligible for BAL emissions. \n  * The GaugeAdder has to be updated to handle this extension as we are ready to add gauges from additional networks. The smart contracts team at Balancer Labs has deployed a coordinator contract to facilitate this upgrading.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xf354daf0ed08373938b30da9e47e8814fd8922881eb6baf6560ae34b78ceeb5b); \\[BIP-31\\] Authorize the Batch Relayer v3\n  * The functionality included in v3 is mainly intended to help with the upcoming migration of stabal3 and bb-a-USD to the soon-to-be-deployed new version of bb-a-USD. The previously known vulnerabilities are addressed in this updated bb-a-USD, which also adds new functionality like recovery mode and the capacity to charge the Aave yield the Balancer's protocol cost.\n  * The new Batch Relayer will also be able to stake and unstake on the user's behalf in the gauges. This will make it possible to complete the aforementioned migration in a single transaction (after the user has approved the Batch Relayer). Additionally, it can make claims for user rewards from gauges, creating the prospect of claim-invest-stake flows for a single transaction.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x29a37ab71ce03a5e167fd012c363e72088bd0554d2b25c99f3373fa7cceb7124); \\[BIP-32\\] Funding Proposal for Daoism Systems: PROTOCOL REVENUE SHARING FOR POOL & FACTORY CREATORS\n  * In Berlin, Daoism Systems was established in January 2022 by computer scientists, engineers, and researchers to develop on-chain solutions for web3 enterprises. \n  * The team is taking the initiative with this proposal to forge closer ties between Daoism Systems and Balancer and to contribute our skills to the expansion of Balancer's ecosystem.\n  * The author sincerely feels that implementing the revenue-sharing protocol for pool and factory designers will enhance Balancer's governance efficacy and make it more appealing for developers to build new products on top of Balancer.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x797467e0b451a49773cfea97359a32ab880caee688d16fe7db41f94a4e0570f0); \\[BIP-33\\] Orb Marketing Budget Proposal for the Remainder of Q3\n  * This proposal aims to continue Balancer marketing within the newly funded Orb Collective Service Provider (SP), under the new Operating Framework. \n  * The Orb marketing team wants to hasten Balancer Protocol's development and public exposure. The marketing demands of Balancer are ever-evolving. Each advertising campaign, product launch, or announcement is unique and designed for the occasion. Instead of semi-annually or annually, the team will ask for a budget every three months to make the biggest impact and show off Balancer's full potential. Balancer has reduced numerous expenses in order to be as lean as possible and whether the current market while it is in the middle of a bear cycle.\n  * For the remainder of Q3, a budget of $ 76,770.00 has been requested.

How could we use additional DeFi legos to bring them to the next level?\n\n## Dopex’s Interest Rate Options\n\nDopex’s new release, Curve [Interest Rate Options](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-papers-interest-rate-options-retail) (IRO), are financial derivatives where the underlying asset is the yield on any Curve liquidity pool. They’re like their TradFi [counterparts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateoptions.asp), but they’re permissionless and entirely on-chain. Like traditional options, traders have the ability to purchase existing contracts or write their own calls and puts, where the writer has complete freedom in specifying strikes, spots, expiry dates, and leverage. They are the latest addition to the Curve ecosystem and make it even more sophisticated.\n\nWhy do these work?\n\nYields on Curve pools are so unpredictable—yet so integral—to cash flow. For example, while increases in a pool’s liquidity (TVL) are always welcomed, they may dilute yields to an individual if emission allocations are held constant. Admittedly, gauge votes can solve this problem, but no gauge is ever guaranteed a larger piece of the emissions pie. Further, Curve APYs are subject to the price of Curve, which goes up or down with some correlation to the macro environment.\n\nCurve IROs normalize these externalities. With a simple [strategy](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-papers-interest-rate-options-retail), protocols and individuals can hedge against losses incurred by weaker pools, or even vote strategically to equalize information asymmetry. Curve IROs are a tool to remove some of the uncertainty from gauge votes, and where uncertainty remains, they are a tool to capitalize on it.\n\n**But IROs run deeper than just hedging.** If you want to truly unlock the full potential of IROs, a strategic combination with the Pitch meta-governance ecosystem is in order.\n\n## Vote-Incentive Strategies with Pitch\n\nLast week, we [wrote](https://mirror.xyz/0xfceEF8F8C8fF6CeD87EB8F92B972F3fCdE3230B4/DkwEnkk7MVESb2nAz2tSaBANU5Mn8LRGv45n_5HwG6E) about how the incentives economy wields the power to alter human incentive structures in DeFi governance. This week, we expand on this idea by noting the incentive economy’s ability to help participants leverage information asymmetry. This is made possible by combining Dopex’s IROs with Pitch’s incentives marketplace and staking services. Indeed, Dopex IROs can augment liquidity pool yields earned from pitched incentives and may subsidize gauge vote costs. \n\n**A simple workflow of this two-prong process illustrates our point.** \n\nSuppose Protocol A occupies 10% of the Curve emissions gauge and is seeking to gain 11%: a net 1% increase. It may turn to Pitch to incentivize veCRV holders to vote for its gauge. We may further assume that Protocol A is relatively confident in its ability to sway the gauge weight with this method, and is thus expecting higher APYs for its liquidity providers.\n\nHowever, to further boost its gains, Protocol A may buy calls on its LP yields, thus offering the protocol a dynamic settlement reward provided the option expires in the money. Protocol A is, in effect, leveraging its yields while minimizing direct exposure to large losses that come with typical leveraging. Protocol A could augment this strategy by buying puts on other gauges that it suspects will see decreased yields resulting from Protocol A’s gains.\n\nNow suppose that the epoch has ended and the option has, in fact, expired in the money. Protocol A has **increased its relative gauge weight**, **increased its yield**, **disbursed voting rewards on Pitch**, and **will enjoy the settlement rewards from the successful call option**. A converse strategy could be used to hedge this yield as well.\n\nThus, the strategic marriage between Pitch and IROs accomplished a few things. \n\n* As normal, *Protocol A* increased its gauge weight by incentivizing gauge votes in its favor using Pitch’s governance console\n* Unlike before, however, *Protocol A* safely and effectively leveraged these gains with call options, collecting settlement rewards as well.\n* And, *Protocol A* has protected itself against information asymmetry by hedging in both directions, speculating on increases in its own yield and decreases in other gauges’ yield, too. \n* Finally, by leveraging IROs with the Pitch incentives marketplace, *Protocol A* enjoys its significant advantage over other protocols vying for emissions who are pitching and earning yield conventionally. ** \n **\n\nThe use of Pitch’s vote incentives marketplace, staking services, and IROs provided *Protocol A* with previously unseen **vote-incentive strategies**. This is capital that may then be transferred to the Frax ecosystem as pitchFXS or used for further incentives on our platform, furthering the flywheel. \n\n## Why Now?\n\nWith the FRAXBP now live and new metapools surfacing weekly, there is no better time to use this strategic workflow than now. It comes at a time where risk mitigation is crucial and market intelligence is paramount. The Pitch-IRO synergy provides both of these benefits. But the benefits extend to DeFi more broadly, too.  \n\n### Advantages to All, Both Big and Small\n\nFirst, it is good for the big and small players by making the risks of information asymmetry less costly. This is particularly important for individual voters who cannot bear the costs of miscalculations due to faulty market intelligence. For larger players, it minimizes the risk of an unsuccessful incentivization campaign. For example, if *Protocol A* does not increase its Curve APY, it can hedge the loss with puts on that same pool.\n\nSecond, the Pitch-IRO symbiosis encourages more vote incentivization than seen currently. Regular pitches can become extremely costly, but by leveraging IROs with strategic incentives, protocols reduce their overall cost of pitching by increasing profitability at the end. Vote incentives increase the likelihood that a protocol receives a larger share of Curve emissions, but pairing IROs with the pitch means that protocols can hedge their losses, increasing the stability of the strategy and contributing to its longevity. \n\nPlus, the revenue stream from ITM options could entirely subsidize future pitches, meaning a protocol would not need to think twice about incentivizing with large rewards on a regular basis. \n\n### Vitalizing a New Economy\n\nIROs affect people not involved with gauge voting or their incentives at all – it creates an entirely new options economy. Anyone who holds the underlying assets—in this case, LP tokens—wields the power to sell contracts to protocols looking to augment their gauge vote yields, further intertwining the meta-governance and IRO economies.\n\nThese individuals—or even DAOs—would link two booming sectors in DeFi to spark and sustain innovation in both spaces. This would pay off immensely for all those involved. Writers earn sizable notional premiums and slashed deposit rates with generous opportunities for leverage — up to 500x. Options writing creates additional income for liquidity providers on top of the yield and boost they receive simply for providing liquidity. Using IROs in the incentives marketplace thus allows providers to exercise their LP tokens beyond lending and trading.\n\nThe Pitch-IRO symbiosis combines two existing and tested technologies to further enhance DeFi governance, letting protocols and users hedge and/or leverage their bets on the future of liquidity.\n\nHow will you be pitching next epoch?\n\n## Learn More\n\nWe’re a group of open-source contributors and actively encourage members of the community to get involved.

Source: TradingView*\n\nAs the debate about the market's direction continues to rage, here are the important levels to watch heading into the weekend, according to analysts.\n\n## Bitcoin needs weekly close above $22,800\n\nThe significance of Bitcoin trading above its 200-week MA was noted by independent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who [posted](https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1550452397213995009) the following chart highlighting the major support and resistance zones:\n\n*BTC/USDT 1-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nAccording to van de Poppe, Bitcoin is “facing crucial resistance again” at $23,500, and what happens next will determine if its price heads higher or pulls back to support at $21,500. He explained:\n\n> “If that breaks at $23.8K, I'm assuming we'll continue and then $28K is on the tables, but we also have a clear breakout above the 200-Week MA confirmed.”\n\nThe importance of BTC holding above the 200-week MA was further addressed by market analyst Rekt Capital, who highlighted the need for Bitcoin to see a weekly close above $22,800:\n\n## Anticipating a big move\n\nThe recent price action is a sign that “a big move for #BTC is going to happen soon,” according to crypto trader and pseudonymous Twitter user CryptoGodJohn, who [provided](https://twitter.com/CryptoGodJohn/status/1550489630377742337) the following chart outlining two possible paths Bitcoin could take:\n\n*BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nCryptoGodJohn said:\n\n> “Break above and hold $24,200. I think we squeeze to $27K–$28K fairly quickly. If we start accepting back into the range, I am looking for a flush down to $20K. Pretty easy invalidation on both, stay safe.”\n\n***Related: [Pro Bitcoin traders are uncomfortable with bullish positions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-bitcoin-traders-are-uncomfortable-with-bullish-positions)***\n\nThe possibility of a move in either direction was also noted by the Twitter user Mayne, who [posted](https://twitter.com/Tradermayne/status/1550330046774140929) the following chart addressing the “potential range break out” for Bitcoin.\n\n*BTC/USD 12-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nThey further explained: “Upside could be juicy if we can hold above $22.5k/range high. Lose the range high, this was likely a deviation. The move above range high becomes your risk as you target shorts back into the range.”\n\n## Keeping it simple\n\nFor those who are more inclined to accumulate and hodl as opposed to focusing on the day-to-day price movements of Bitcoin, market analyst Caleb Franzen offered the following insight to when it would be a good time to dollar-cost average:\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.048 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42%.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.
