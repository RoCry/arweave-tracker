Qual foi a razão do meu interesse? A necessidade de sentir na pele os preços a subir, o salário estagnado e uma ambição de descobrir a razão e o porquê de ser um afortunado com este presente que é a vida.\n\nSempre gostei de pessoas, de as ouvir mas nunca tive interesse por política ou como o dinheiro funciona, até mesmo o que é o dinheiro, como a razão de o usarmos e o idolatrar todos os dias. No entanto, depois de alguns anos de independência percebi que a falta de interesse de minha parte foi induzida e programada na “folha em branco” desde o nascimento. Na minha opinião, esta folha em branco não está vazia, limpa e pronta para outras pessoas pintarem com as cores e texturas que idealizam. Acredito que quando nascemos a nossa tela já tem cor e desejos, não importa quais são, só sei que não é “branca”. \n\nÉ com este desabafo que tentarei transmitir o que tenho estado a aprender, a informação que tenho consumido sobre as peças do jogo que é a vida.

Adjust Level 2 requirements (long executor)\n  * This proposal is for the Aave community's approval to modify the governance standards (proposition power, quorum vote differential) for Level 2 ideas, which will have an impact on the most important parts of the Aave ecosystem.\n  * From the perspective of the BGD, this is strongly advised because those requirements were established in the past when the AAVE fragmentation was different and because it could result in the creation of an artificial and self-imposed bottleneck to pass proposals that, given their technical nature, shouldn't really face opposition.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe1e42fd73a2d734d78a65e514a6996c785e90bc82a2e896825dd4af003aeec15); \\[BIP-29\\] Introduce GaugeAdder v2\n  * The GaugeAdder is a component of veBAL architecture that securely facilitates the process of adding new gauges to the system. It incorporates checks to make sure that only gauges deployed from authorized gauge makers can be included in the veBAL system and become eligible for BAL emissions. \n  * The GaugeAdder has to be updated to handle this extension as we are ready to add gauges from additional networks. The smart contracts team at Balancer Labs has deployed a coordinator contract to facilitate this upgrading.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xf354daf0ed08373938b30da9e47e8814fd8922881eb6baf6560ae34b78ceeb5b); \\[BIP-31\\] Authorize the Batch Relayer v3\n  * The functionality included in v3 is mainly intended to help with the upcoming migration of stabal3 and bb-a-USD to the soon-to-be-deployed new version of bb-a-USD. The previously known vulnerabilities are addressed in this updated bb-a-USD, which also adds new functionality like recovery mode and the capacity to charge the Aave yield the Balancer's protocol cost.\n  * The new Batch Relayer will also be able to stake and unstake on the user's behalf in the gauges. This will make it possible to complete the aforementioned migration in a single transaction (after the user has approved the Batch Relayer). Additionally, it can make claims for user rewards from gauges, creating the prospect of claim-invest-stake flows for a single transaction.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x29a37ab71ce03a5e167fd012c363e72088bd0554d2b25c99f3373fa7cceb7124); \\[BIP-32\\] Funding Proposal for Daoism Systems: PROTOCOL REVENUE SHARING FOR POOL & FACTORY CREATORS\n  * In Berlin, Daoism Systems was established in January 2022 by computer scientists, engineers, and researchers to develop on-chain solutions for web3 enterprises. \n  * The team is taking the initiative with this proposal to forge closer ties between Daoism Systems and Balancer and to contribute our skills to the expansion of Balancer's ecosystem.\n  * The author sincerely feels that implementing the revenue-sharing protocol for pool and factory designers will enhance Balancer's governance efficacy and make it more appealing for developers to build new products on top of Balancer.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x797467e0b451a49773cfea97359a32ab880caee688d16fe7db41f94a4e0570f0); \\[BIP-33\\] Orb Marketing Budget Proposal for the Remainder of Q3\n  * This proposal aims to continue Balancer marketing within the newly funded Orb Collective Service Provider (SP), under the new Operating Framework. \n  * The Orb marketing team wants to hasten Balancer Protocol's development and public exposure. The marketing demands of Balancer are ever-evolving. Each advertising campaign, product launch, or announcement is unique and designed for the occasion. Instead of semi-annually or annually, the team will ask for a budget every three months to make the biggest impact and show off Balancer's full potential. Balancer has reduced numerous expenses in order to be as lean as possible and whether the current market while it is in the middle of a bear cycle.\n  * For the remainder of Q3, a budget of $ 76,770.00 has been requested.

How could we use additional DeFi legos to bring them to the next level?\n\n## Dopex’s Interest Rate Options\n\nDopex’s new release, Curve [Interest Rate Options](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-papers-interest-rate-options-retail) (IRO), are financial derivatives where the underlying asset is the yield on any Curve liquidity pool. They’re like their TradFi [counterparts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateoptions.asp), but they’re permissionless and entirely on-chain. Like traditional options, traders have the ability to purchase existing contracts or write their own calls and puts, where the writer has complete freedom in specifying strikes, spots, expiry dates, and leverage. They are the latest addition to the Curve ecosystem and make it even more sophisticated.\n\nWhy do these work?\n\nYields on Curve pools are so unpredictable—yet so integral—to cash flow. For example, while increases in a pool’s liquidity (TVL) are always welcomed, they may dilute yields to an individual if emission allocations are held constant. Admittedly, gauge votes can solve this problem, but no gauge is ever guaranteed a larger piece of the emissions pie. Further, Curve APYs are subject to the price of Curve, which goes up or down with some correlation to the macro environment.\n\nCurve IROs normalize these externalities. With a simple [strategy](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-papers-interest-rate-options-retail), protocols and individuals can hedge against losses incurred by weaker pools, or even vote strategically to equalize information asymmetry. Curve IROs are a tool to remove some of the uncertainty from gauge votes, and where uncertainty remains, they are a tool to capitalize on it.\n\n**But IROs run deeper than just hedging.** If you want to truly unlock the full potential of IROs, a strategic combination with the Pitch meta-governance ecosystem is in order.\n\n## Vote-Incentive Strategies with Pitch\n\nLast week, we [wrote](https://mirror.xyz/0xfceEF8F8C8fF6CeD87EB8F92B972F3fCdE3230B4/DkwEnkk7MVESb2nAz2tSaBANU5Mn8LRGv45n_5HwG6E) about how the incentives economy wields the power to alter human incentive structures in DeFi governance. This week, we expand on this idea by noting the incentive economy’s ability to help participants leverage information asymmetry. This is made possible by combining Dopex’s IROs with Pitch’s incentives marketplace and staking services. Indeed, Dopex IROs can augment liquidity pool yields earned from pitched incentives and may subsidize gauge vote costs. \n\n**A simple workflow of this two-prong process illustrates our point.** \n\nSuppose Protocol A occupies 10% of the Curve emissions gauge and is seeking to gain 11%: a net 1% increase. It may turn to Pitch to incentivize veCRV holders to vote for its gauge. We may further assume that Protocol A is relatively confident in its ability to sway the gauge weight with this method, and is thus expecting higher APYs for its liquidity providers.\n\nHowever, to further boost its gains, Protocol A may buy calls on its LP yields, thus offering the protocol a dynamic settlement reward provided the option expires in the money. Protocol A is, in effect, leveraging its yields while minimizing direct exposure to large losses that come with typical leveraging. Protocol A could augment this strategy by buying puts on other gauges that it suspects will see decreased yields resulting from Protocol A’s gains.\n\nNow suppose that the epoch has ended and the option has, in fact, expired in the money. Protocol A has **increased its relative gauge weight**, **increased its yield**, **disbursed voting rewards on Pitch**, and **will enjoy the settlement rewards from the successful call option**. A converse strategy could be used to hedge this yield as well.\n\nThus, the strategic marriage between Pitch and IROs accomplished a few things. \n\n* As normal, *Protocol A* increased its gauge weight by incentivizing gauge votes in its favor using Pitch’s governance console\n* Unlike before, however, *Protocol A* safely and effectively leveraged these gains with call options, collecting settlement rewards as well.\n* And, *Protocol A* has protected itself against information asymmetry by hedging in both directions, speculating on increases in its own yield and decreases in other gauges’ yield, too. \n* Finally, by leveraging IROs with the Pitch incentives marketplace, *Protocol A* enjoys its significant advantage over other protocols vying for emissions who are pitching and earning yield conventionally. ** \n **\n\nThe use of Pitch’s vote incentives marketplace, staking services, and IROs provided *Protocol A* with previously unseen **vote-incentive strategies**. This is capital that may then be transferred to the Frax ecosystem as pitchFXS or used for further incentives on our platform, furthering the flywheel. \n\n## Why Now?\n\nWith the FRAXBP now live and new metapools surfacing weekly, there is no better time to use this strategic workflow than now. It comes at a time where risk mitigation is crucial and market intelligence is paramount. The Pitch-IRO synergy provides both of these benefits. But the benefits extend to DeFi more broadly, too.  \n\n### Advantages to All, Both Big and Small\n\nFirst, it is good for the big and small players by making the risks of information asymmetry less costly. This is particularly important for individual voters who cannot bear the costs of miscalculations due to faulty market intelligence. For larger players, it minimizes the risk of an unsuccessful incentivization campaign. For example, if *Protocol A* does not increase its Curve APY, it can hedge the loss with puts on that same pool.\n\nSecond, the Pitch-IRO symbiosis encourages more vote incentivization than seen currently. Regular pitches can become extremely costly, but by leveraging IROs with strategic incentives, protocols reduce their overall cost of pitching by increasing profitability at the end. Vote incentives increase the likelihood that a protocol receives a larger share of Curve emissions, but pairing IROs with the pitch means that protocols can hedge their losses, increasing the stability of the strategy and contributing to its longevity. \n\nPlus, the revenue stream from ITM options could entirely subsidize future pitches, meaning a protocol would not need to think twice about incentivizing with large rewards on a regular basis. \n\n### Vitalizing a New Economy\n\nIROs affect people not involved with gauge voting or their incentives at all – it creates an entirely new options economy. Anyone who holds the underlying assets—in this case, LP tokens—wields the power to sell contracts to protocols looking to augment their gauge vote yields, further intertwining the meta-governance and IRO economies.\n\nThese individuals—or even DAOs—would link two booming sectors in DeFi to spark and sustain innovation in both spaces. This would pay off immensely for all those involved. Writers earn sizable notional premiums and slashed deposit rates with generous opportunities for leverage — up to 500x. Options writing creates additional income for liquidity providers on top of the yield and boost they receive simply for providing liquidity. Using IROs in the incentives marketplace thus allows providers to exercise their LP tokens beyond lending and trading.\n\nThe Pitch-IRO symbiosis combines two existing and tested technologies to further enhance DeFi governance, letting protocols and users hedge and/or leverage their bets on the future of liquidity.\n\nHow will you be pitching next epoch?\n\n## Learn More\n\nWe’re a group of open-source contributors and actively encourage members of the community to get involved.

Source: TradingView*\n\nAs the debate about the market's direction continues to rage, here are the important levels to watch heading into the weekend, according to analysts.\n\n## Bitcoin needs weekly close above $22,800\n\nThe significance of Bitcoin trading above its 200-week MA was noted by independent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who [posted](https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1550452397213995009) the following chart highlighting the major support and resistance zones:\n\n*BTC/USDT 1-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nAccording to van de Poppe, Bitcoin is “facing crucial resistance again” at $23,500, and what happens next will determine if its price heads higher or pulls back to support at $21,500. He explained:\n\n> “If that breaks at $23.8K, I'm assuming we'll continue and then $28K is on the tables, but we also have a clear breakout above the 200-Week MA confirmed.”\n\nThe importance of BTC holding above the 200-week MA was further addressed by market analyst Rekt Capital, who highlighted the need for Bitcoin to see a weekly close above $22,800:\n\n## Anticipating a big move\n\nThe recent price action is a sign that “a big move for #BTC is going to happen soon,” according to crypto trader and pseudonymous Twitter user CryptoGodJohn, who [provided](https://twitter.com/CryptoGodJohn/status/1550489630377742337) the following chart outlining two possible paths Bitcoin could take:\n\n*BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nCryptoGodJohn said:\n\n> “Break above and hold $24,200. I think we squeeze to $27K–$28K fairly quickly. If we start accepting back into the range, I am looking for a flush down to $20K. Pretty easy invalidation on both, stay safe.”\n\n***Related: [Pro Bitcoin traders are uncomfortable with bullish positions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-bitcoin-traders-are-uncomfortable-with-bullish-positions)***\n\nThe possibility of a move in either direction was also noted by the Twitter user Mayne, who [posted](https://twitter.com/Tradermayne/status/1550330046774140929) the following chart addressing the “potential range break out” for Bitcoin.\n\n*BTC/USD 12-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nThey further explained: “Upside could be juicy if we can hold above $22.5k/range high. Lose the range high, this was likely a deviation. The move above range high becomes your risk as you target shorts back into the range.”\n\n## Keeping it simple\n\nFor those who are more inclined to accumulate and hodl as opposed to focusing on the day-to-day price movements of Bitcoin, market analyst Caleb Franzen offered the following insight to when it would be a good time to dollar-cost average:\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.048 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42%.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

This information could include your IP address, operating system, and geography.\n\nAll it takes is the creator placing an image URL in the NFT ‘s metadata that points to a machine they control that logs the request. Many web servers like Apache and NGINX can do this by default. The team at HOPR have created a series of Non-Private NFTs that show this vulnerability.\n\n> Note: this is in addition to the data a wallet like MetaMask leaks to RPC providers. You can learn more about this by checking out [DERP (Dumb Ethereum RPC Provider)](https://derp.hoprnet.org/) from the HOPR team.\n\nYou can see them generated live at their [Non-Private NFT](https://non-private-nft.hoprnet.org/) tool. They have a great post on explaining how it works and why it’s bad: [Your NFT Might be Watching You](https://medium.com/hoprnet/your-nft-might-be-watching-you-8c7ec078788f). They also have a [Non-Private NFT](https://github.com/hoprnet/non-private-nft) GitHub repo that shows how the collection could work.\n\nBelow, you can see a NFT I generated using the tool. I viewed the NFT three different ways: in my MetaMask wallet on Android, directly in Chrome, and on OpenSea.\n\n![When viewed in MetaMask on Android](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2KfGI8ulE0Q7BBJNE0fbk.png?height=900&width=600)\n\n![When viewed directly in Chrome on my laptop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0bm3nCSWYWVcLoBwuQc9L.png?height=900&width=600)\n\n![When viewed on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fbmhUMspXFlNRhjIe6ro9.png?height=900&width=600)\n\nIn the first two examples, the NFT shows my actual information. However, the OpenSea example is a different since their servers cache and serve the image. In that case, it shows the information of the AWS server OpenSea used to request the image. In each case, you can see the information is different.\n\nYou can see these NFT images generated live using HOPR’s [Non-Private NFT](https://non-private-nft.hoprnet.org/) tool. There’s a great Medium post explaining how it works and why it’s bad: [Your NFT Might be Watching You](https://medium.com/hoprnet/your-nft-might-be-watching-you-8c7ec078788f). There’s a corresponding [Non-Private NFT](https://github.com/hoprnet/non-private-nft) GitHub repo that shows how the collection could work.\n\nThis is a pretty clear case to demonstrate the need for web3 metadata privacy. Luckily, there are web3 privacy projects in the works to address this. One of which is HOPR, an incentivized mixnet enabling privacy-preserving point-to-point data exchange. It can be compared to Tor but with incentives for noderunners.

{"id": "qIWG89vJPp5DlJF25XiMFR905K3RCYxeOnYRJGn26xs", "title": "W jaki sposób nauka może pomóc odnaleźć sens życia?", "body": "## Skąd ten kryzys?\n\nWiększość z nas fantazjuje o zrobieniu czegoś, co całkowicie odmieni nasze życie. To fantazja o podjęciu odpowiedniej decyzji, założeniu biznesu czy dokonaniu rewolucyjnego odkrycia naukowego. Wolność wyboru i władza, jaką mamy nad samym sobą, jest największym skarbem ludzkości. Poczucie wolności pojawia się w momentach, w których dostrzegamy, jaką moc mają nasze czyny i jak wielką odpowiedzialność trzymamy we własnych rękach. Jesteśmy panami swojej rzeczywistości. Możemy zmienić w niej wszystko. Jednak z czasem owe uczucie wolności może stać się przekleństwem, może przybrać formę przerażenia i paniki. Wraz z możliwością wyboru pojawia się odpowiedzialność, a z odpowiedzialnością – presja i niepokój. Tylko my sami możemy obrać własną ścieżkę w życiu, ustanowić autonomiczny system wartości, zbudować spójną tożsamość. Nie możemy nikogo winić za obranie niewłaściwego kierunku.\n\nWewnętrzne konflikty, poczucie pustki i lęku związane z celowością życia często prowadzą do kryzysów emocjonalno-egzystencjalnych. Taki rodzaj stresu zmusza jednostkę do aktywacji różnych mechanizmów obronnych. Powrót do „normalności” wymaga ponownej oceny sposobów myślenia i działania, co wiąże się ze zmianą tożsamości. Aby zapobiec przerażającej wizji transformacji, uciekamy w pustkę, stan „nie-bycia”. Wybieramy zautomatyzowane życie pozbawione refleksji. Zaprzestajemy używania świadomego rozumu, inaczej: systemu drugiego. Utrwala się modularność globalnej sieci roboczej, promując kompulsywne zachowania. Taki wybór ma zapobiec utracie energii życiowej oraz spowodować ucieczkę od dyskomfortu odczuwanego przy wykonywaniu złożonych zadań. Zamiast wymagającej poznawczo eksploracji, nieustannie eksploatujemy dobrze nam znaną rzeczywistość, korzystając z automatycznego i nieświadomego systemu pierwszego. Większość podejmowanych działań jest obarczona błędami poznawczymi (cognitive bias) – nieracjonalnymi wzorcami postrzegania świata, opartymi na pozarozumowej wiedzy. Gdy przestajemy używać rozumu, oddajemy swoją wolność. A z pewnością znajdzie się ktoś, kto chętnie nam tę wolność odbierze, dając w zamian poczucie złudnego bezpieczeństwa. \n\nŻyjemy w czasach, w których promowane są konsumpcjonizm i natychmiastowa gratyfikacja. Niekończący się wyścig szczurów ciągle trwa i zbiera żniwo. Zatracamy własną tożsamość w pogoni za karierą, wpadając w nowe choroby psychiczne związane z kryzysem egzystencji. Z pomocą przychodzi medycyna, która (z reguły) nie bada źródeł zaburzeń psychicznych, zwalcza jedynie objawy choroby, ordynując standardowy zestaw leków, których przyjmowanie często wiąże się z przykrymi efektami ubocznymi. Neuroleptyki czy leki z grupy SxRI mogą „spłaszczać” odczuwane emocje, powodować nadwagę i spadki libido. Spółki farmaceutyczne przygotowały również wspaniałe remedium dla ludzi ciężko chorych, wymagających szczególnej opieki. W aptekach znajdziemy cały arsenał leków mających właściwości narkotyzujące, które mogą silnie uzależniać zarówno psychicznie i fizycznie. Jeżeli pacjent nie odbędzie skutecznej terapii psychologicznej, to po odstawieniu leków choroba bardzo często powraca. Postępująca medykalizacja nie jest zjawiskiem budzącym większej kontrowersji w przestrzeni publicznej. Dostajemy natychmiastowe i skuteczne rozwiązanie kryzysów życiowych w postaci garści tabletek. I to jest super wygodne. \n\nTaki wypaczony styl życia jest promowany przez media, które są wykorzystywane przez polityków, firmy, korporacje, osoby publiczne i prywatne do osiągnięcia różnych celów: ekonomicznych, propagandowych lub nawet czysto dezinformacyjnych. Irracjonalność staje się narzędziem marketingowym. Media kształtują odruchowe postawy odbiorców w taki sposób, by poszukiwali oni przede wszystkim stymulacji emocjonalnej, a także wybierali formy proste, atrakcyjne i niewymagające wysiłku poznawczego. Emocje i szok są wykorzystywane do przyciągania uwagi. Panuje ogólny nadmiar treści i każdy te treści może redystrybuować – niezależnie od tego, czy są zgodne z prawdą, czy nie. Autorytetami dla społeczeństwa stają się influencerzy z social mediów. Podążanie własną ścieżką jest podkopywane autodestrukcyjnymi zachowaniami. \n\nKonstruowanie przekazów skłaniających do biernego, posłusznego odbioru sprawia, że ludzie w żaden sposób nie chcą weryfikować przekonań ani wchodzić w dyskusję, tylko przyjmują przekaz jako prawdę. Niestety już od najmłodszych lat życia człowieka wpaja się mu, że posłuszny i bezkrytyczny odbiór informacji przekazywany przez osoby przedstawiane jako autorytatywne to coś słusznego. Umiera kreatywność i sceptyczne podejście do przyjmowania informacji. Opinia „specjalistów” w kitlu całkowicie może wpłynąć na podejmowane decyzje i kształtowane opinie. Co gorsza, niektórzy ludzie są w stanie bezgranicznie uwierzyć w słowa „specjalistów” w sutannach, strojach rytualnych czy jeszcze innych szatach czarnoksiężników. Ale dzięki temu nie trzeba szukać trudnych rozwiązań na skomplikowane problemy. A to jest super łatwe i przyjemne. \n\nNasz brak umiejętności realizacji swoich celów prowadzi do uciekania się w fikcję i nieprawdopodobne konstrukcje myślowe, byle tylko utrzymać ego w komfortowej pozycji. Błędne rozumienie świata może powodować w życiu ludzi niebezpieczne sytuacje i rozpowszechnianie irracjonalności, stąd już mały krok do zatracenia osobistej wolności i sensu życiowego.\n\n## Kognitywistyka jako emergentny, wielopoziomowy opis rzeczywistości\n\nPoczątkowo, w czasach starożytnych, poszukiwaniem odpowiedzi, które miały prowadzić do zrozumienia świata, zajmowali się filozofowie. Filozofia jest często ujmowana jako metadyscyplina – najbardziej ogólna z dziedzin wiedzy, wyznaczająca ich podstawy metodologiczne i warunki funkcjonowania (w starożytności nie było podziału między filozofią a nauką). Filozofia rozumiana jako nauka stawia sobie za zadanie prawdziwe poznanie danego przedmiotu. Z tak rozumianej filozofii wywodzą się współczesne szczegółowe dyscypliny naukowe. Pojęcie filozofii oznacza szeroko rozumianą ciekawość intelektualną i poszukiwanie wiedzy. Już od czasów starożytności ludzie próbowali zrozumieć prawa opisujące świat rzeczywisty i złożoność ludzkiego gatunku. Co istnieje? Co mogę wiedzieć? Co mogę zrozumieć? \n\nW odpowiedzi na współczesne pytania związane z funkcjonowaniem umysłu powstała nowa dziedzina nauki: kognitywistyka. Jej głównym wyzwaniem jest integracja wiedzy, znalezienie „mostu” łączącego różne paradygmaty opisu ludzkiego umysłu . Kognitywistyka czerpie m.in. z antropologii, psychologii, lingwistyki, neuronauk. Wykorzystuje również uczenie maszynowe i algorytmiczną teorię grafów. Każda z wymienionych dziedzin wykorzystuje różną metodologię i posiada własną terminologię. Nauki kognitywne badają podobieństwa zachodzące między integrowanymi dziedzinami, jednocześnie zachowując spójną metodologię, której ramy konceptualne są wyznaczane dzięki dyskursowi filozoficznemu. \n\nZarówno zagadki nauk kognitywnych, jak i złożone problemy życiowe wymagają myślenia, dzięki któremu możemy znaleźć rozwiązanie. To myślenie to przekształcenia dokonywane na umysłowych reprezentacjach świata. W tym sensie myślenie zastępuje działanie - pozwala na symulowanie wydarzeń rozgrywających się w świecie realnym, bez negatywnych, ale i pozytywnych konsekwencji typowych dla rzeczywistego zachowania. Myślenie jest jednym z narzędzi budowania modeli mentalnych i opisów rzeczywistości zawierających m.in alternatywne wersje wydarzeń, które mogłyby być skutkiem podjęcia określonych działań. \n\nWykonywanie czynności angażujących poznawczo, w tym konstruowanie wspomnianych symulacji mentalnych, mocno integruje sieć funkcjonalną mózgu. Jest to proces przyswajania nowych informacji. Powtarzając systematycznie określone działanie, sieć w stanie segregacji (spoczynku) zwiększa modularność sieci, dzięki czemu „zapisujemy” naszą skonstruowaną reprezentację, a jej przywołanie w przyszłości nie będzie wymagało ponawiania kosztownej integracji sieci. \n\nTworząc nowe pojęcia, prowadząc badania, szukamy złożonych wzorów, które pomagają nam opisać rzeczywistość w nowy sposób. Kognitywistyka poszukuje interakcji i podobieństw w różnych opisach funkcjonowania ludzkiego umysłu. Im więcej takich modeli i im bardziej przystają one do rzeczywistości, tym większe jest prawdopodobieństwo podjęcia optymalnego działania prowadzącego do zmiany paradygmatu. Naukę (w bardzo uproszczony sposób) można opisać jako nieustanny proces konstruowania wzorów lub pojęć (output_1) wyprowadzanych z istniejących już danych (input_1). Następnie nasz (output_1) staje się (inputem_2), z którego wyprowadzamy (output_2) itd. Jest to również powtarzający się cykl integracji-segregacji sieci naszego mózgu. Z mniejszych systemów pojęć i koncepcji wyłaniają się nowe, znaczące patterny, które pomagają nam w głębszym zrozumieniu rzeczywistości. \n\nZgodnie z ujęciem emergencji w trakcie rozwoju świata powstają raptownie i nieprzewidywalnie nowe jakości o coraz większym stopniu organizacji, tworzące hierarchiczny układ. Wyższe jakości wyłaniają się z niższych, jednak nie dają się do nich sprowadzić, gdyż posiadają swoiste cechy. Zjawiska emergentne powstają po osiągnięciu przez system pewnego progu złożoności, powiązań lub organizacji. Pozwala to tłumaczyć takie zjawiska, jak inteligencja. Może ona wynikać z oddziaływania pomiędzy bardzo wieloma prostymi neuronami. \n\nŚwiat widziany z naukowej i filozoficznej perspektywy jest hierarchicznie ustrukturyzowany. Procesy prowadzące do powstania złożonych, samoorganizujących się układów hierarchicznych (fizycznych, chemicznych, neuronalnych, biologicznych) generowane są przez ewolucyjne zasady samoorganizacji. Na różnych poziomach spotykamy różne rodzaje prawidłowości i relacji przyczynowo-skutkowych. To samo dotyczy własności umysłowych człowieka. Nie pojawiają się one znikąd, lecz powstają w długotrwałym procesie ewolucyjnym. Zrozumienie natury relacji między mózgiem a poszczególnymi funkcjami umysłowymi nie jest możliwe bez uwzględnienia ewolucji i zasad działania samego mózgu. \n\nEmergentne spojrzenie na mózg jako sieć interakcji może przyczynić się do lepszego zrozumienia naszych umysłów, a w rezultacie – otaczającej nas rzeczywistości. Zrozumienie jest dobrą podstawą do kultywowania mądrości i racjonalności.\n\n## Psychotechnologie i nauka jako antykryzysowe tarcze\n\nPodczas procesu „wybudzania się” z kryzysu znaczeniowego, opisywanego przez Johna Vervaeke, podkreśla on kluczowość wykorzystywania psychotechnologii: zinternalizowanych sposobów na zapisywanie, przetwarzanie informacji a także poszerzanie zasobów poznawczych. To właśnie dzięki wykorzystaniu psychotechnologii, jak umiejętność pisania, czytania, liczenia, posługiwania się symbolami, możemy zapisywać, przekazywać i korygować nasze procesy myślowe. Stajemy się bardziej świadomi swoich procesów mentalnych. Dzięki wynalezieniu pisma mamy dostęp do skumulowanej wiedzy przekazywanej z pokolenia na pokolenie. Możemy wytwarzać ulepszone narzędzia i technologie, które pozwalają nam na pogłębienie naszej wiedzy dotyczącej rzeczywistości i natury umysłu. Ludzkość staje się mądrzejsza i może polegać na naukowym, racjonalnym opisie świata, który nadaje wiarygodność nowym odkryciom. Rozwija się racjonalność, czyli zdolność do wykorzystywania zgromadzonych informacji do osiągania celów. \n\nJedną z psychotechnologii, która powstała w celu przezwyciężenia kryzysu pustki życiowej, jest vipassana: buddyjska medytacja wglądu, esencja nauk Buddy. Dzięki utrzymywaniu świadomości na wewnętrznych doznaniach cielesnych doświadczamy zjawiska „wglądu” (insight). Podczas praktyki vipassany zmniejsza się aktywność naszej domyślnej sieci roboczej. \n\nOdmiennym sposobem poszerzania swojego „cognitive capacity” jest praktyka kontemplacji, która może być porównywana do zjawiska „mind-wandering”. W przeciwieństwie do vipassany skupia się ona na eksternalizacji naszych myśli, „wychodzeniu” do otaczającego świata i spontanicznym oglądzie rzeczywistości. Nie jest to myślenie ukierunkowane na konkretny cel. Podczas praktyki kontemplacji zwiększa się aktywność sieci domyślnej. Może to prowadzić do spontanicznej integracji niektórych sieci, co będzie ułatwiało nam „przestawianie się” na myślenie zorientowane na konkretnym celu i zwiększało kontrolę nad procesami myślowymi. \n\nUmiejętność aktywnego przełączania się między segregacją i integracją jest nazywana stanem flow – stanem całkowitego skupienia na jakiejś czynności, pozytywnym zatraceniu się w chwili obecnej. Stan flow może być odmiennym, wyższym stanem świadomości, bliskim transcendencji, w którym istnienie przedmiotu poznania jest poza umysłem poznającym. \n\nStan flow kojarzy mi się z psychodelicznymi doświadczeniami, podczas których sieć się integruje i segreguje jednocześnie. Istotna staje się wówczs tylko chwila teraźniejsza i nasze wewnętrzne doznania. Jednocześnie wychodzenie myślami poza własną egzystencję jest bardzo proste, wręcz domyślne. Psychodeliczne doświadczenie to tymczasowy stan, który stawia przed nami wyzwanie radykalnej transformacji. Przebywając tu i teraz, możemy rozmyślać nad złożonością rzeczywistości (kompromis między integracją a segregacją sieci). Czasem nie musimy używać kontroli poznawczej, czasem działamy jakby zaprogramowani przez „wyższą świadomość”. Przykładowo: nie potrzebujemy kontroli poznawczej, żeby powstrzymać się przed spożyciem przetworzonego jedzenia, tak jakby wgrano nam wzorzec, który domyślnie „rozumie”, że nie jest to odpowiedni pokarm dla „przebudzonego człowieka” (choć w rzeczywistości lubię smak czipsów). Ale chwila: można przecież powiedzieć: „Nie potrzebuję żadnych substancji psychoaktywnych, by wiedzieć, że czipsy są niezdrowe”. Jednak przebywanie w stanie odmiennej świadomości sprawia, że nasz wgląd jest przytłaczająco oczywisty, dzięki czemu wywiera głębszy wpływ na różne sfery egzystencji (w tym przypadku na wybór odpowiedniego sposobu odżywiania się). \n\nCelem stosowania różnych psychotechnologii, szukania odmiennych stanów świadomości i wglądu jest poznanie samego siebie oraz wykształcenie umiejętności określenia tego, co nam się podoba i czego pragniemy. To dzięki „większej” przestrzeni i otwartości umysłu jesteśmy w stanie odszukiwać, formułować i rozwiązywać nowe problemy. Nabywamy umiejętności do wyszukiwania wartościowych informacji, dzięki którym rozumiemy świat (i samych siebie) w bardziej wysublimowany sposób. Zaczynamy dostrzegać wielowymiarowość pewnych aspektów rzeczywistości. Zdobywamy rozsądek i „wewnętrzną mądrość” – zaczynamy rozumieć, co nas unosi, a co ciągnie na dno. \n\nAby dotrzeć do celu, powinniśmy nauczyć się również cierpliwości. To doświadczenie, które płynie z przeżyć i rozczarowań, czyni nas silniejszymi. Nie jest ono stałym punktem, lecz drogą, która kształtuje nasz los. Liczy się to, by nie powtarzać identycznych błędów, obejmować porażki świadomością i stale się rozwijać. Przekraczać własne granice, by stać się tym, kim naprawdę chce się być. Prawdopodobnie tworzenie lepszej przyszłości jest sensem życia. Racjonalny świat nauki powinien pomóc odkryć ten sens każdemu, kto jeszcze go nie znalazł. Tego właśnie życzę nam wszystkim.", "timestamp": 1658535177, "digest": "10t2cCqHf-fWn3rZf05EXc__JHDTliodMWc0Zj2HALo", "contributor": "0x58134e52A6cd119b46F62c4f6612Df56e9ad8E8f"}

Media报道，韩国科技巨头Hancom旗下加密子公司Arowana Hub推出的加密项目遭遇诉讼，Arowana Coin代币投资者面临大规模亏损风险。首尔中央地方法院6日接受了对Arowana Coin投资的普通投资者的债权临时扣押申请。因此，钱包管理人Hexlant保管的Arowana基金会所有的4.3亿多枚Arowana Coin被临时扣押，在诉讼结束之前这些代币禁止移动。普通投资者索赔的损失金额为800亿韩元（约合6089万美元）。如果投资者赢了，法院最多可以将5000万枚Arowana Coin代币在不锁仓的情况下转给投资者，并允许投资者在交易所出售。\n\n此前，投资者与Hancom签订了5000万枚Arowana Coin投资合同，并支付了这笔钱。Hancom曾承诺将在2021年代币上线交易所后将这些代币转移至投资者的钱包中，但并未兑现。Arowana Coin于2021年上线Bithumb交易所后，立即暴涨超1000%。投资人声称，就算是按照Arowana Coin最低价计算，损失金额也达到了1156亿韩元（约合8799万美元）。而投资者与Hancom的代币投资合同发生纠纷，Bithumb对此未进行披露，被质疑没有对投资者采取保护措施。据悉，Arowana (ARW) 项目是一个处理黄金等实物资产价值的区块链平台，有人怀疑金Arowana Coin被用于为Hancom董事长金相哲筹集行贿资金，调查仍在进行中。Hancom公司随后对法院扣押资金一事提出异议，称申请临时扣押的投资者与Aronawa Hub没有债务关系。\n\n[英国《金融时报》推出加密金融板块](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/p80uo24n.html)\n\n据FinanceFeeds报道，英国《金融时报》推出了Cryptofinance板块，这是一个集合加密货币报道的新的数字中心和每周通讯，旨在揭示数字资产行业以及创新如何影响主流金融。\n\n[外媒：美国SEC官员回应称SEC尚未就BNB向币安发出传票](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/tu83e2yt.html)\n\n加密媒体CoinDesk根据《信息自由法》向SEC提交了一份“SEC就调查BNB代币向币安发出的传票”的请求被退回，但一位SEC官员在回复中写道：“根据你在信中提供的信息，我们对SEC的各种记录系统进行了彻底搜索，但没有找到或识别任何响应你请求的信息。”据悉，彭博社曾于6月份报道，美国SEC正在调查BNB代币是否为未注册的证券，对此赵长鹏回应币安就其产品与当局保持定期联系，并否认该公司已被传唤。\n\n[三箭资本创始人Su

Zhu在接受电话采访时表示：“一直躲藏且没有出席近期的一系列法庭活动是因为受到了死亡威胁，但这并不意味着我们没有与所有相关部门进行沟通，在事发后我们一直有保持联系。”两人拒绝透露他们在哪里，但电话中的一位律师表示，他们的最终目的地是阿拉伯联合酋长国。\n\n此外，Su Zhu和Kyle Davies描述了风险管理的系统性失败，宽松的流动信贷加剧了错误押注的影响。他们承认其失败为行业其他人引发的连锁反应造成了损失，但强调他们也遭受了巨大的损失，并对此感到懊悔，同时也否认了他们在危机爆发前从三箭资本撤资的指控。Su Zhu还表示，他们未预料到LUNA能在几天内跌至归零，并引发整个行业的信贷紧缩，从而对三箭所有流动性不足的头寸造成巨大压力。尽管如此，该基金仍能够继续从大型数字资产贷方和富有的投资者那里借款，直到这些机构本身陷入危机。在LUNA崩盘后，Su Zhu表示贷方对三箭资本的财务状况“感到满意”，并允许他们继续交易。\n\n对于外界质疑其“奢靡”的生活，Su Zhu表示：“此前传闻的破产之际支付5000万美元首付买游艇的消息不实，那艘游艇是1年前委托建造的，并且有完整的资金来源。我每天骑自行车上下班，和我的家人在新加坡只有两个家。出问题时总有人喜欢写出这样的新闻。”在回答有关该公司哪里出了问题时，Su Zhu提到了多年牛市带来的过度自信，牛市不仅注入了他和Davies的思维力，还注入了几乎所有的行业信贷基础设施，在这些领域，因为有像他这样的融资公司，贷方看到了他们的价值膨胀。\n\n[BlockFi第二季度透明度报告：有18亿美元未偿贷款，已制定流动性指导方案](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/h1584h4x.html)\n\n据Cointelegraph报道，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，截至第二季度末，公司拥有来自机构和散户投资者的18亿美元未偿贷款，其中6亿美元是无抵押贷款。机构贷款占未偿贷款总额的15亿美元，而散户贷款占剩余的3亿美元。\n\nBlockFi表示已经制定指导方案，以帮助其保持必要的流动性来履行核心业务活动，包括机构和零售借贷和交易活动。该指导方案将根据客户的需求在库存中持有至少10%的总金额，并准备好退还给客户。还将在可在7天内收回并返还给客户的地方持有至少50%的欠款，并将根据需要将欠客户总额的至少90%用于存货或可偿还的贷款中。这类贷款将在一年内召回。\n\n[Coinbase发布二季度投资备忘录，Web

V3正式部署至Celo网络，Celo也为自己的生态吸引到了影响力最大的项目。借助于Uniswap的深度、无许可性以及集中流动性架构，Celo将在其上构建与碳信用代币相关的流动性池，以提升碳市场的资本流动性，同时也为其他协议在Celo上整合碳信用打下基础，第一个流动性池将是Moss碳信用代币池CELO/MCO2。\n\n与很多面向所有市场的Layer1的公链不同，Celo定位是一条主打去中心化移动支付的区块链网络，其主网于2020年4月正式上线，旨在让全球没有银行账户的用户也能够通过手机等移动设备享受DeFi产品所带来的便利性，所以非洲和诸多欠发达国家是其市场重点。除了采用PoS共识机制、兼容EVM、具有跨链互操作性外，其特点还包括以稳定币作为汇款、跨境支付等交易媒介、支持多种代币支付Gas费、将电话号码映射到钱包地址以简化转账操作等。2021年4月，欧洲最大的电信运营商德国电信公司宣布对Celo进行投资，此前的投资机构还包括a16z、Coinbase Ventures、Electric Capital、Jack Dorsey等。\n\n除了推动去中心化金融的发展外，Celo还致力于为环保事业做出贡献，此次和Uniswap“结盟”也是为了共同推进ReFi（Regenerative Finance）的发展。顾名思义，ReFi指的是可再生金融，旨在通过Web3技术扭转气候变化，即利用区块链技术的透明机制，将现实中的自然资产引入链上，同时引入激励机制，对绿色发展作出贡献的行为进行奖励，以推动可持续性发展。据Celo基金会估计，ReFi将是一个万亿规模的经济市场，目前最常见的ReFi项目就是碳信用代币化类，比如Toucan、Flow Carbon和Moss等，Celo也与上述项目建立了合作关系，而碳信用代币的流动性问题是当下面临的挑战之一，此次Celo与Uniswap的合作也是为了提升该市场的资本效率。ReFi是一个全新叙事，PANews也对其进行了深度解读[“万字长文解读ReFi：全新的Web3叙事范式，可编程的经济循环”](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/0wbr3ltq.html)。\n\n据PANews统计，目前

{"id": "rD23dT3adYbMpSGK8QNDIPI350WuauchVe9Hqca-hT0", "title": "Building a Stable Platform", "body": "As the dust has begun to (hopefully) settle on the crypto crash, people have begun sorting through the rubble to figure out which products from this last cycle were useful and real, and which were hypes and ponzis. I’ve thrown my hat into this ring too many times, including two pieces on web3 use cases: Today and in the Future.\n\nOne category that seems to be unanimously viewed as useful, outside of the most skeptical skeptics, is stablecoins. It’s one of the use cases I highlighted a month ago. And among the stablecoins, the consensus seems to be that USDC is the stablest of them all.\n\nStablecoins are sneakily fascinating because they’re both a digital currency and a sort of platform on top of which new applications can be built, or old ones improved. But to achieve that promise, they need to actually be stable. A dollar-denominated stablecoin, like USDC, needs to be redeemable for a good ol’ fashioned US Dollar, every time, everywhere.\n\nIf a stablecoin can be trusted to perform that foundational obligation, then developers can begin to build financial products on modern digital rails. Sometimes, they’ll build entirely new applications, like DeFi protocols. Others, they’ll rip out pieces of old, creaky financial infrastructure and replace them with newer rails.\n\nThe revolution does not need to be total to be impactful. Circle is a case study in compromise. It’s a centralized company facilitating the growth of a decentralized financial system. It’s used by web2, web3, and web2.5 companies alike. It’s happy to sit in the background, facilitating fast, cheap, global payments and loans while others build shiny interfaces and sturdy guardrails on top.\n\nAfter seeing USDC’s outperformance during the bear market – its market cap has grown as the overall market has shrunk – and seeing a lot of people I respect point to USDC as a gold standard, I decided to team up with Circle to tell the story via a Sponsored Deep Dive. You can read more about how I choose which companies to work with on Sponsored Deep Dives here. In this case, I realized that I didn’t know nearly as much about stablecoins as I should, and I was pumped that they were willing to work with me to help understand and then explain.\n\nAs always: this is not financial or investment advice. I’m an idiot, and I’m learning as I go – you would be foolish to allocate your cash based on anything I write. Do your own research. But I hope that it’s an entertaining and informative look into one of crypto’s key building blocks.\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\nCircle & USDC: Building a Stable Platform\n(Click the link to read the full thing online)\n\nYes, I know. This newsletter is called Not Boring. But I’m going to start this essay off by showing you the Most Boring Chart in All of Crypto.\n\nCoinMarketCap\nThat’s the 1 year price chart of USD Coin (“USDC”), the fiat-backed, fully-collateralized, dollar-denominated stablecoin issued by Circle. I dare you to find me a more boring chart.\n\nFor the entire past year, as prices of other crypto assets rollercoastered up and down and up and very down, USDC hugged the $1 line tightly. 🥱\n\nFor stablecoins, boring is good. Boring is the goal. And being the most boring stablecoin results in a chart that isn’t very boring at all:\n\nCoinMarketCap (Click “Market Cap” on the Chart)\nThat’s USDC’s market cap since its inception in October 2018, which represents the total USDC in circulation. At the time of writing, July 20th, 2022, that number stands at $54.8 billion. Circulating USDC has more than doubled in the past year, after growing 25x between July 2020 and July 2021. Since its price is pegged to $1, increases in market cap mean that there’s more usage of USDC (the inverse is also true – the market cap declines when people redeem their USDC for Dollars).\n\nBoring is a feature, not a bug. It’s key to Circle’s first product value proposition – digital dollars – and it’s key to Circle’s mission: To raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value.\n\nIf you’ve heard of Circle, it’s likely because of USDC. That’s the company’s first killer product. Recently, it announced that it’s launching a second, Euro Coin (EUROC).\n\nBut thinking about USDC and EUROC as just stablecoins misses the company’s ambitions to become:\n\nThe platform on top of which developers build a new financial system\n\nThe digital currency of choice institutional investors leverage for trading and settlement\n\nA tool that enables the frictionless, borderless exchange of value\n\nIt’s an ambitious bet in a competitive space, and one dogged by both valid and invalid concerns, many of which we’ll cover in this piece. Circle is trying to differentiate on trust, the necessary foundation for its ambitions. Increasingly, it seems to be working.\n\nI didn’t give much thought to stablecoins until Luna’s UST blew up a couple of months ago. But as I’ve dug in, I’ve realized that they’re one of the most solid use cases in web3 today, and a fundamental building block in the much bigger visions entrepreneurs in the space are building towards. Once the idea of programmable, permissionless money worms into your brain, it’s hard to see where stablecoins wouldn’t provide an improvement over the status quo.\n\nBut let’s start with the basics and build up from there:\n\nWhat are stablecoins?\n\nHow do stablecoin issuers generate revenue?\n\nWhy are stablecoins a valuable primitive?\n\nHow are USDC and Circle a platform?\n\nWhat is Circle’s competitive advantage?\n\nWhat would a new financial system built on Circle’s rails look like?\n\nWhat Are Stablecoins?\nIf you’ve followed the crypto markets recently, you might’ve heard the word “stablecoin” and chuckled. “Stablecoin, huh?” you’d quip, “Not very … stable 😂.” It’s a funny joke.\n\nCoinMarketCap\nIn May, UST (Terra’s stablecoin) lost its peg to the dollar (translation: it became worth less than $1). It flushed hard, bringing the entire Luna ecosystem down with it. Ultimately, it brought down crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (“3AC”) which contributed to the downfall of Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and other Centralized Finance (“CeFi”) lenders. Friend of the newsletter Jon Wu wrote a great thread / Not Boring essay on Terra-Luna and UST, and Arthur Hayes wrote the definitive piece on the 3AC collapse in case you want to read more gory details.\n\nThe UST situation brought to light something that was apparent to anyone who dug into the math or simply walked through the logic: not all stablecoins are created equal. Not all stablecoins are … stable.\n\nThe goal of a stablecoin is to stay pegged to its reference asset. For most stablecoins, that’s the US Dollar. So one (1) USD stablecoin – like USDC – should be worth $1. As Alex Danco wrote in 2018:\n\nThe crucial test that any stablecoin must pass for the market to actually trust it is: if a user wants to redeem their stablecoins for genuine dollars, under any reasonable circumstance, can they do so?\n\n“Reasonable” is doing a lot of work here. People should always be able to redeem their stablecoins for genuine dollars. There are three main models stablecoin issuers pursue to make that happen:\n\nFiat-Backed\n\nCryptocurrency-Backed\n\nAlgorithmic\n\nWe’ll start last, first. Algorithmic stablecoins, like UST, aren’t backed by dollars, a basket of cryptos, commodities, or anything, really, outside of what they create themselves.\n\nInstead of explaining this insanity myself, I’ll turn it over to the inimitable Matt Levine:\n\nHere is how an algorithmic stablecoin works:\n\nYou wake up one morning and invent two crypto tokens.\n\nOne of them is the stablecoin, which I will call “Terra,” for reasons that will become apparent.\n\nThe other one is not the stablecoin. I will call it “Luna.”\n\nTo be clear, they are both just things you made up, just numbers on a ledger. (Probably the ledger is maintained on a decentralized blockchain, though in theory you could do this on your computer in Excel.)\n\nYou try to find people to buy them.\n\nLuna will trade at some price determined by supply and demand. If you make it up on your computer and keep the list in Excel and smirk when you tell people about this, that price will be zero, and none of this will work.\n\nBut if you do a good job of marketing Luna, that price will not be zero. If the price is not zero then you’re in business.\n\nYou promise that people can always exchange one Terra for $1 worth of Luna. If Luna trades at $0.10, then one Terra will get you 10 Luna. If Luna trades at $20, then one Terra will get you 0.05 Luna. Doesn’t matter. The price of Luna is arbitrary, but one Terra always gets you $1 worth of Luna. (And vice versa: People can always exchange $1 worth of Luna for one Terra.)\n\nYou set up an automated smart contract — the “algorithm” in “algorithmic stablecoin” — to let people exchange their Terras for Lunas and Lunas for Terras.\n\nTerra should trade at $1. If it trades above $1, people — arbitrageurs — can buy $1 worth of Luna for $1 and exchange them for one Terra worth more than a dollar, for an instant profit. If it trades below $1, people can buy one Terra for less than a dollar and exchange it for $1 worth of Luna, for an instant profit. These arbitrage trades push the price of Terra back to $1 if it ever goes higher or lower.\n\nThe price of Luna will fluctuate. Over time, as trust in this ecosystem grows, it will probably mostly go up. But that is not essential to the stablecoin concept. As long as Luna robustly has a non-zero value, you can exchange one Terra for some quantity of Luna that is worth $1, which means Terra should be worth $1, which means that its value should be stable.\n\n“All of this is,” Levine writes, “quite straightforward and correct, except for Point 7, which is insane.” $UST and $LUNA rose in tandem, and they fell in tandem.\n\nAfter UST’s collapse, the market for algorithmic stablecoins will likely be muted for a long time, so we don’t need to spend more time here.\n\nCryptocurrency-backed stablecoins are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies and are typically overcollateralized, meaning that the dollar value of cryptocurrencies in the reserve exceeds the dollar value of stablecoins outstanding. They achieve this by requiring each user to deposit more in another token, like ETH or BTC, than they pull out in stablecoin.\n\nThe leading example here is MakerDAO’s stablecoin, DAI, with a $7.2 billion market cap.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nA user who wants to take out a loan opens a Vault by sending ERC-20 tokens like ETH, Wrapped BTC, and USDC to the smart contract and receives DAI in return.\n\nDAI borrowing is overcollateralized, meaning that you need to put in a higher dollar value in your ERC-20 token of choice than you take out in DAI, with higher collateral ratios depending on the volatility and liquidity of the token you deposit. Currently, ETH has a minimum collateral ratio of 170%, Wrapped BTC of 175%, and Staked ETH of 185%.\n\nAt any time, you can deposit your DAI back in and unlock the ERC-20 you’d locked up.\n\nIf, however, the price of your ERC-20 of choice drops to a point that breaks the minimum collateral ratio, Maker will liquidate you, or sell your tokens.\n\nThe disadvantage of borrowing DAI is that you need to put up a lot of collateral – currently, to borrow DAI with ETH requires a minimum collateral ratio of 170%, meaning I’d need to put in at least $17,000 worth of ETH to get 10,000 DAI. I also have to pay a Variable Annual Fee, currently at 0.50% for ETH deposits.\n\nOasis App\nPlus, if the price of ETH drops to a point that breaks that ratio – in this case, if it drops even one cent – the smart contract liquidates me by selling the ETH. That could mean that you might be forced to sell at an inopportune time.\n\nThe advantage of DAI to the borrower is that it’s completely on-chain, without the need for a centralized intermediary, and works well with your existing crypto holdings. If you want to hold onto your ETH but take out a little walking around money, you can just lock up the ETH, get DAI, and use it for any of the things you might use stablecoins for.\n\nThe advantage of DAI as a protocol is that, by being overcollateralized and liquidating below certain thresholds, it can maintain stability and keep the promise that users can redeem their DAI for their ERC-20 tokens in any reasonable scenario.\n\nAs a result, even during the recent turmoil, DAI has held up well. DAI’s chart isn’t quite as boring as USDC’s, but it’s pretty boring:\n\nCoinMarketCap\nAt the time of writing, it’s trading at around $1.00, as designed.\n\nThere are other crypto-backed stablecoins that are pegged to the dollar, with more launching regularly, others pegged to assets besides the US Dollar, and others still that aren’t pegged to anything at all. Some just want to be reserve currencies themselves. OlympusDAO, for example, has a mix of tokens in its reserve, backing its “Future Decentralized Reserve Currency,” Ohm. If you’ve seen the (3,3) or (something, something) meme on Twitter, that comes from the game theory behind Ohm, that it’s better for everyone if everyone just stakes their Ohm and holds. Ohm has had a bumpy ride, falling from a peak of $420 to a current price of $52.\n\nThere are other promising crypto reserve currency projects, all vying to build an internet-native reserve that isn’t tied to the value of any fiat currency, but they’re different than stablecoins and outside the scope of this piece.\n\nThat brings us to fiat-backed stablecoins, like USDC.\n\nCircle’s USDC stablecoin is the most straightforward of the major stablecoins: for every dollar of USDC in circulation, Circle holds $1 worth of straight cash and US Treasury Bills, for which there is the deepest and most liquid market of any asset in the world.\n\nTwitter avatar for @WatcherGuru\nWatcher.Guru\n@WatcherGuru\nJUST IN: Circle says they hold 80% of their $USDC reserves in US Treasury bills and 20% in cash within the US banking system.\nJuly 5th 2022\n\n453 Retweets3,505 Likes\nIf you want to redeem 1 USDC for $1, no magic needs to happen. The dollar is sitting there, either right in the USDC reserve bank accounts at BNY Mellon and other large banks, or invested in short-term Treasuries that are easier than anything else in the world to exchange into dollars. Circle posts weekly reporting and monthly attestations on its website:\n\nCircle\nIn a recent interview, Circle CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen said that Circle’s customers “could redeem all of USDC in one day. We could process those redemptions, and the only limits to the time that they would get their U.S. dollars back are the limits in the settlement systems of the fiat currency banking system itself.”\n\nSome people – from pseudonymous Twitter accounts with 12 followers to journalist Matt Taibbi – have expressed concerns about Circle and USDC, ranging from the idea that centralized institutions cannot be trusted to issues with the structure of its agreement with BlackRock around the Circle Reserve Fund. The concerns boil down to whether or not there will always be a US Dollar available when a customer wants to redeem a USDC, which breaks down into whether Circle holds its reserve in the assets it says it does (Cash and short-term Treasuries) and whether Circle’s business operations and USDC reserves are separate.\n\nMany of these claims seem to stem from a misunderstanding of how USDC works, how reserves are held today, and the differences between USDC and Circle itself.\n\nAddressing the first point, whether Circle holds what it says it does, and where, and what exactly it holds, Circle has been very transparent with its holdings. In the past, it has held commercial paper, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Yankee CDs, but in September 2021, it moved all of its USDC reserves into cash and cash equivalents, per the 2021 Circle Examination Report by Grant Thornton.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the growth of stablecoins “has rightly brought significant federal regulatory attention” and that it would hold all USDC reserves in cash and short-duration US government treasuries “given our commitment to maintaining high standards, which in some cases go beyond those required by our regulators.”\n\nIn addition to monthly attestations and the annual audit, last week, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted a CUSIP-level breakdown of the reserve’s T-Bill holdings:\n\nTwitter avatar for @jerallaire\nJeremy Allaire\n@jerallaire\n1/ As part of our commitment to increasing transparency and disclosure around USDC, today we're publishing our first monthly breakdown of the USDC reserve assets, by each and every Treasury Bond and list of cash reserve custodians.circle.com/blog/providing…\nImage\nJuly 14th 2022\n\n545 Retweets2,780 Likes\nHe said that the company is working to get permission from banking partners to disclose how much it holds with each bank.\n\nOn the second, the separation between Circle’s business operations and USDC, Circle offers products that are separate from USDC, like APIs, SeedInvest, and Circle Yield. Given the recent meltdowns at Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and others, investors and commenters are most worried about Circle Yield, but Circle’s product is different in that it’s only available to institutional accredited investors. Currently, it offers very low rates.\n\nCircle Yield\nImportantly, Circle’s yield product doesn’t touch its USDC reserves. Circle doesn’t lend its USDC reserves to anyone, it lets institutional accredited investors earn yields on their own USDC.\n\nMore broadly, Circle has publicly stated that its USDC reserve funds are held for the benefit of USDC token holders: “Circle does not and will not use USDC holders’ money to run its business or pay its debts. These funds are in segregated accounts.”\n\nFurther, Circle is regulated as a Money Services Business and licensed under the rules and state money transmission licenses that govern major US payment institutions including Stripe, PayPal, and Apple.\n\nTo be clear, though: everything has risk. Theoretically, in my opinion, the biggest risk to USDC is that one of its bank partners completely implodes or the US Government defaults on its debt, in which case, God help us all. But it’s important to point out that even though USDC seems to be the most stable of the stablecoins, there are always risks and people always need to be careful with their money. The S-4 that Circle and Concord Acquisition Corp. filed with the SEC in relation to a proposed SPAC deal lists 23 risks on pages 29 and 30.  To be very clear: this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework.\n\nBased on conversations with investors and others in crypto, USDC is the most trusted stablecoin in the market. As one friend who’s deep in the bowels of the crypto trading community put it, “Anyone legit in the space holding stablecoins is holding USDC.”\n\nCurrently, there is $54.8 billion in USDC, which means it holds cash or Treasuries worth as much via its bank and custodian partners. Every year, Circle’s reserves are audited by a leading public accounting firm, and every month, accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP attests to the fact that it has as much or more in reserves as there are USDC outstanding.\n\nGrant Thornton LLP May 2022 Circle Attestation\nLike I said, boring. The most boring, even among fiat-backed fully-reserved stablecoins.\n\nTether, which issues the leading stablecoin by market cap, USDT, has come under fire numerous times over the years over concerns about what it does with the money it receives in exchange for USDT. Stripe’s Patrick Mackenzie and friend of the newsletter Alex Danco both wrote great overviews of Tether’s issues in 2019, Patrick’s here and Alex’s here. This whole 85k follower Twitter account, Bitfinex’ed, rose to prominence for calling out Tether. One of the most serious allegations against Tether is that its CFO, Giancarlo Devasini, used Tether reserves to plug a hole in crypto exchange Bitfinex’s balance sheet, which was particularly troubling both because it meant that Tether was not fully reserved, and because Devasini was a large investor in Bitfinex.\n\nAmong the more recent claims against Tether are that its reserves are partially backed by billions of dollars in Chinese commercial paper, as reported by Bloomberg (and denied by Tether), and that it lent money to other crypto companies with Bitcoin as collateral. Additionally, the company settled a lawsuit with New York’s attorney general “over allegations that they moved hundreds of millions of dollars to cover up the apparent loss of $850 million of commingled client and corporate funds” for $18.5 million.\n\nCover of Bloomberg Businessweek\nDespite the heat, and the lawsuits, and the government scrutiny, Tether has proven to be Teflon, maintaining a $65.9 billion market cap, down from a high of $83 billion achieved before UST spooked the market for all but the most stable stables.\n\nTether’s legitimacy has been debated ad nauseum and is out of the scope of this essay, but it’s worth noting that despite $17 billion in net outflows, Tether currently trades at $1. For his part, Jeremy Allaire said on the Bankless podcast that he believes that Tether will be around for a long time and has useful applications, particularly in Asia.\n\nBut when the job of a stablecoin is to earn trust, any hair is an impediment. At the heart of Tether’s challenges is the fact that the company is not transparent, and doesn’t disclose where its money is held or what it holds. Particularly in a market like this one, that’s not ideal.\n\nTransparency is where Circle stands out. Largely by earning more trust, USDC is on its way toward flipping USDT as the largest stablecoin. As DeFi Surfer highlighted in Crypto’s Third Trillion Dollar Opportunity, USDC is rapidly gaining market share:\n\nCoinGecko Data Charted by DeFi Surfer\nTrust is foundational for stablecoins: people need to trust that their internet dollar will get them a fiat dollar. Trust is the main reason that USDC is stealing market share from USDT, and one of the reasons that fiat-backed stablecoins remain much larger than algorithmic or crypto-backed stablecoins.\n\nMaintaining trust isn’t easy, though. It requires resisting temptation.\n\nHow Do Stablecoin Issuers Generate Revenue?\nLet’s take a quick but very important aside to understand how stablecoin issuers generate revenue. It’s weird to think of a currency, digital or otherwise, as a business, but understanding how it works will help you understand the motivations of different stablecoin issuers.\n\nVery simply put, the revenue formula for stablecoin issuers is $ in Reserves \\* Yield on $’s in Reserves.\n\nSo a useful framing to keep in mind as you read this piece is that there are two main ways that a stablecoin issuer can increase its revenue:\n\nGrow Reserves\n\nGenerate a Higher Yield on Reserves\n\nGrowing reserves is straightforward. As a stablecoin issuer issues more stablecoins, it trades $1 from the customer for 1 dollar-denominated stablecoin that it creates. It puts that $1 in its reserve. If someone redeems, they give the $1 back in exchange for the 1 stablecoin. So you can think of this growth lever like most companies: increase usage of the product.\n\nGenerating a higher yield on reserves is a little more complicated, and this is where stablecoin issuers can get into trouble. Stablecoin issuers need to generate some yield, that’s how the business works.\n\nKeeping every dollar in USD when redemptions are paid out in USD guarantees that there will always be a dollar available (assuming the banks you’re depositing with don’t go out of business), but bank accounts generate next to nothing.\n\nThe next-least-risky is short-duration US Treasury bonds, like 1-month and 3-Month T-Bills. The yield on 3-Month T-Bills is commonly referred to as the “risk-free rate.” Something very bad would need to happen to not be able to get your dollar back from the US Treasury.\n\nToday, 3-Month T-Bills offer a rate of 2.29%, meaning $1 billion in reserves invested in 3-Month T-Bills would generate $22.9 million per year in risk-free\\* interest income. (\\*Nothing is really risk-free.) Not bad!\n\nBut for some, having $1 billion just sitting there earning the risk-free rate is too boring. There’s so much more money to be made! For them, there are a bunch of different ways to generate higher yields on reserves, including:\n\nA fractional reserve model (like banks) means that you can lend each dollar more than once.\n\nInvesting reserves in riskier assets should generate higher yields on each dollar. Riskier assets might include longer duration Treasuries (like a 10-Year Treasury Bond), commercial paper, Chinese commercial paper, Yankee Deposits, DeFi, crypto-lending, and even equity or fund investments.\n\nPushing 25% of the reserves into even slightly riskier debt that generates something like 4% would mean an additional $4.275 million in interest income per year versus putting it all in 3-Month T-Bills, juicing revenue 19% by doing something that, in most market environments, should be totally fine.\n\nBut each basis point of additional yield comes with additional risk. The history of financial markets is full of examples of things that should have been safe in most market environments blowing up spectacularly. CeFi lenders like Voyager and Celsius were riskier than they seemed. Companies default on debt. Countries can default on their debts. During the Global Financial Crisis, the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck”, almost destroying the economy as investors withdrew $172 billion from money market accounts before the Fed stepped in.\n\nOver a long enough time horizon, increasing yields on reserves is antithetical to growing $ in reserves, because increasing yields decreases the chance that there will be a dollar there when people want to redeem, which ultimately decreases trust. For pegged stablecoins, trust is paramount. Whoever engenders the most trust among investors through their actions and transparency will win through growth.\n\nCircle has opted to grow reserves, rather than chase higher yields, in order to grow revenue.\n\nWin trust. Grow $ in reserves. Win more trust. Become the standard that developers and financial institutions rely on to build new tools and capabilities.\n\nBecause while the value prop that 1 USDC = $1 is crucially important, it’s just the starting point.  What makes stablecoins particularly compelling is their digital superpowers.\n\nWhy Are Stablecoins a Valuable Primitive?\nCryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH haven’t caught on as a medium of exchange outside of the crypto economy. The main reason is that they’re so volatile.\n\nWhat consumer wants to spend 1 ETH on rent and watch the price rocket up 10% the next day? What business wants to receive 1 ETH for services rendered and watch the price fall 10% the next day?\n\nThe most obvious benefit of stablecoins relative to more volatile tokens is just that: their stability. If both parties in a transaction can reasonably assume that 1 USDC = $1, they can transact like they would in dollars.\n\nThe bigger question is why stablecoins are useful relative to good ol’ fashioned dollars, or the bank-intermediated versions thereof. To answer that, we need to start with what I think is the most fundamental thing to understand about crypto in general: crypto gives physical properties to digital assets.\n\nCash has some advantages over bank accounts. If you have $1,000,000 stashed under your mattress, and you need to pay a business associate $100,000, you can simply pull out a few stacks and pay them directly, right now, for free. Often, if you tried to make the same payment through a bank, you might have to pay wire fees (especially if you want the transaction to settle on the same day) or even need to physically go to the bank to sign papers. If your associate is in another country, that’s probably another fee, and it’s going to take a while. Oh, it’s Saturday? You’ll need to try again on Monday, between 9am - 4pm.\n\nPaper cash has some obvious drawbacks, too. It doesn’t earn anything. Keeping all of that money under your mattress might make for an uncomfortable night’s sleep. If your house catches on fire, the money disappears. A robber can break into your house and steal it. More practically, to give $100,000 to your business associate, one of you is going to need to travel to the other. If you live nearby, that’s a minor headache; if you live in different countries, it becomes very impractical. And then, once you do exchange the money, you need to manually enter the transaction in your accounting software of choice.\n\nAnyway, you know the limitations of cash. There are reasons we don’t use it much anymore. Sending wires online, or even Venmos for smaller sums, is so much more convenient than cash that people put up with the slowness, fees, and lack of control that comes with online banking.\n\nBut… there’s gotta be a better way, right?\n\nThat’s the basic thing stablecoins are trying to achieve: cash with digital superpowers.\n\nIn a great thread on the importance of stablecoins, ChainLinkGod spelled out those superpowers.\n\nTwitter avatar for @ChainLinkGod\nChainLinkGod.eth\n@ChainLinkGod\n1/ Stablecoins are the Trojan Horse that will bring smart contracts to the masses\n\nWhy?\n\nThey’re the probably the first and only real-world use-case of crypto today that is fully sustainable and rapidly scaling\n\nA 🧵 on #Stablecoins and how they’ll take over the global economy\nImage\nMay 23rd 2022\n\n269 Retweets1,050 Likes\nHe tweeted that stablecoins are a “superior form of fiat” that are:\n\nProgrammable\n\nPermissionless\n\nBorderless\n\nLow-cost\n\nFast settlement\n\nInteroperable\n\nHighly liquid\n\nLet’s unpack each.\n\nProgrammable means that stablecoins can be coded to do certain things automatically. In a simple example, if I get my paycheck in stablecoins, a smart contract can automatically release my payment directly every two weeks (or every day, or every hour, given the low transaction costs) with just my wallet address. Some can even be sent to a DeFi lending protocol where I can earn yield, or swapped into ETH, automatically.\n\nPermissionless means that I can send you a stablecoin, right now, with just your wallet address, without needing to go through a bank, just like cash, but digital. It also means that developers can build applications that use stablecoins without speaking to the issuer.\n\nBorderless means that there’s no distinction between sending money to someone in your same country and another country – there’s no such thing as an “international wire” here. I saw the power of this firsthand when a few of Not Boring Capital’s LPs asked to fund their commitments via USDC because the process was so much simpler, cheaper, and faster than trying to fund internationally through their bank.\n\nLow-cost is pretty self-explanatory, but also means that there aren’t any bank fees for holding or sending money. Today, on Ethereum, gas fees can be prohibitive for smaller transactions, but that gas fee remains constant whether you’re sending $1 or $1 million. But already, sending USDC on an Ethereum Layer 2 like Polygon – which is what Stripe does (more below) – or a cheaper L1 like Solana brings the cost down to next-to-nothing. Over time, sending money should be as cheap as sending an email.\n\nFast settlement means that as I send money to someone, or receive money from someone, that money is actually in my account and not in their account. If you’ve ever had pending transactions in your bank account, or received a payment that’s on the way but not yet in your account, you’ve felt slow settlement. For a good time, check out this Quora on how bank settlement works. Fast settlement, combined with features like programmability and interoperability, mean that money should be able to zip around faster than in the traditional system (at least in the US today; countries like India have better systems, and faster settlement should be coming to the US via FedNow.)\n\nInteroperable means that stablecoins can plug into any of the other web3 protocols and applications, and even into many traditional companies, seamlessly. Interoperability makes stablecoins behave a bit like platforms, which we’ll touch on shortly.\n\nHighly liquid means that there’s enough stablecoin out there that they can easily be bought or sold. There’s over $54.8 billion of USDC alone in the system.\n\nObviously, there are risks as well.\n\nFor example, what happens when you send your money to the wrong address? Unless there’s someone really nice on the other end, that money is gone. What happens if you forget your seed phrase and can’t access your wallet? Money’s gone in that case, too. Wallet gets hacked? Gone. And there’s no bank on the other end to make you whole.\n\nThese are real risks for any self-custodied digital asset, and before buying, holding, or sending digital assets, you need to make sure that you’re using best practices like hot and cold wallets, sending test transactions, and never, ever clicking on a Metamask support link. It should get safer over time, as both Circle and the broader developer ecosystem are building products and infrastructure to mitigate the risks and protect users.\n\nBack to the benefits, this being crypto, all of those pieces can combine and compose to create novel benefits. Or rather, entrepreneurs can combine those features to create novel apps that would not have been possible before.\n\nTo date, the largest use case for stablecoins has been crypto trading. Funds and individual traders use stablecoins for a bunch of reasons – instant settlement, complex trades without currency risk (needing to make a directional bet on the price of Bitcoin), access to foreign exchange, taking on leverage, and accessing the DeFi markets, where you can’t just plug in US Dollars. Plus, if you want to trade on a decentralized exchanged (“DEX”) like Uniswap, you can’t transact in USD; if you want to sell ETH, for example, for an asset that doesn’t have currency risk against the US Dollar, you’ll trade it for USDC or another dollar-denominated stablecoin.\n\nUSDC is used for all of those things, but Circle’s real ambition is to be a platform on top of which developers build novel, previously-impossible financial products.\n\nThis is probably a good place to pause for a second and give a little bit of Circle’s history. It wasn’t always a stablecoin company. Its story is a familiar one for platform and API-first companies (see: Amazon AWS & Lithic): build a consumer product, realize the infrastructure doesn’t work, build your own infrastructure, and productize the infrastructure.\n\nCircle’s History: From Bitcoin to USDC\nCircle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire started the company in the early days of crypto, back in 2013, to help consumers “more easily convert, store, send, and receive digital currencies such as bitcoin.”\n\nAllaire was already a tech veteran at the time, having founded the eponymous Allaire Corp. and online video services provider Brightcove before founding Circle.\n\nJeremy Allaire, Circle\nFun fact: after going down the internet rabbit hole in 1990, when it was largely a tool for the government and academia, Jeremy realized that there was an opportunity to commercialize it. In 1992, he wrote a proposal for the commercialization of the internet and submitted it to the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Science & Technology… Al Gore. When Al Gore famously mentioned to Wolf Blitzer that he “took the initiative in creating the internet,” he did so in part based on Jeremy’s proposal.\n\nAnyway, with Jeremy’s background and the early excitement around bitcoin, he had no trouble raising money. Per PitchBook:\n\n2013: $9 million Series A from Breyer Capital, Accel, and General Catalyst\n\n2014: $17 million Series B led by the same investors with Pantera Capital\n\n2015: $50 million Series C led by Goldman Sachs & IDG Capital at a $250M valuation\n\n2016: $60 million Series D led by IDG Capital at a $480 million valuation\n\n2018: $110 million Series E led by Bitmain at a $3 billion valuation\n\nAmazingly, it raised all $246 million before landing on, and announcing, what would become its killer app: USDC, which it announced in May of 2018.\n\nJoao Reginatto, Circle’s VP Product, told me that when he joined the company seven years ago, he signed up to be the product manager for Circle’s consumer app, Circle Pay.\n\nThe plan was to build a product for people who wanted to transfer funds over blockchain rails with an app that abstracted away the complexity and provided a familiar experience. People are most familiar and comfortable with fiat currency, so they enabled Dollar, Euro, and Pound balances and transfers, on Bitcoin’s rails. In the background, they handled all of the liquidity and treasury operations, like converting dollars into BTC and back.\n\nBut by 2016, it was getting too slow to operate on Bitcoin, which was built to be P2P money, not to support apps on top. Then, they tried ETH and it wasn’t quite right, either. Then, they thought about launching their own settlement token. No go. Finally, they realized that what they needed was fiat currencies that run on blockchains.\n\nThey looked into Tether, but didn’t think they could build on top of it, so the team realized they’d need to create their own stablecoin. They brought it to the leadership team, who said, “OK! Go build a stablecoin if you don’t have the rails you need, and then we can come back to Circle Pay.”\n\n“Then,” Joao laughed, “We never came back.”\n\nIn September 2018, Circle and Coinbase launched USDC, and in October, they announced that they’d co-founded the Centre Consortium, “a joint venture aimed at establishing a standard for fiat on the internet and providing a governance framework and network for the global, mainstream adoption of fiat stablecoins.” USDC began circulation in October 2018, and by the first day of 2019, there was $288 million USDC in circulation. To this day, Centre is jointly-owned by Circle and Coinbase and helps set the direction for the protocol, while Circle is the issuer of USDC.\n\nCircle’s history building consumer financial products on the blockchain informed the way that they built USDC.\n\nFirst, it set the tone for Circle’s regulatory and compliance stance from day one.\n\nAs Jeremy explained, one of the earliest questions he and his investors asked about operating financial services on the blockchain was, “Is this even legal?” Some first-time entrepreneurs might just let it rip, but Jeremy had already sold companies and built up a reputation, and he wanted to do it right.\n\nHe hired one of the country’s top regulatory advisory firms out of his own pocket, and they found that while there wasn’t a lot of precedent or guidance, there was some. In March 2013, the US Department of Treasury issued a six-page memo titled, “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies.” Essentially, it said that if you act as an exchanger of money from the banking system to digital currency, you must register as a money transmitter, have Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorism policies in place, and get all the appropriate licenses.\n\nJeremy put it more bluntly: “The reality was, if you wanted to build a business at the intersection of the traditional and new systems, you had to be regulated or go to jail.” But instead of turning him off, Jeremy was actually intrigued by, and drawn to, a space where so much policy work needed to be done:\n\nSomething new that changes society and introduces risk needs new policy – autonomous vehicles, AI, spacecraft, genetics. Regulated spaces are hard because the implications for society are more pronounced. I wanted to work on something hard, and something that was going to be hard globally.\n\nSo from day one, they “walked in through the front door.” The company’s first non-co-founder hire was its General Counsel / Chief Compliance Officer. Starting in late 2013, Jeremy said, “We got every license we possibly could, and became the most licensed and regulated firm in crypto at the time.” Circle was the first company to receive New York’s BitLicense, and helped shape it by providing feedback. According to Joao, after Circle got the first BitLicense, other people would come to the NYC office for meetings and ask to see it, as if it were a relic.\n\nEarly on, and to this day, “doing it in a regulated way brought on a lot of ‘boo hiss’ from the crypto community, but if you want this to be mainstream, you have to do it,” said Jeremy. From the beginning, Circle’s position has been to work with regulators to be part of the dialogue, educate, and “preserve what’s important about crypto: openness, interoperability, programmability, and its inherently global nature.”\n\nSecond, starting by attempting to create consumer products on blockchain rails meant that when Circle created USDC, they built it as a platform on which other developers could build beautiful and frictionless user experiences.\n\nFrom the beginning of USDC’s development, Joao “wanted to build with APIs in mind, and with scalability from the developer’s point of view.” They needed APIs to handle issuance and redemption from the beginning. As soon as the team got USDC to market in 2018, most of it pivoted immediately towards building out APIs and developer tools and documentation.\n\nCircle was preparing for a world in which USDC powered everyday applications in web3, maybe even that it would build itself again, but it was focused on building infrastructure.\n\nIn The Myth of the Infrastructure Phase, USV’s Dani Grant and Nick Grossman described the apps-infrastructure cycle: “First, apps inspire infrastructure. Then that infrastructure enables new apps.”\n\nThe Myth of the Infrastructure Phase, Dani Grant and Nick Grossman, USV\nA developer tries to build an app and realizes that it’s impossible or overly difficult to do with the current infrastructure, so other developers go out and build the infrastructure that would make those apps work, which opens up new possibilities for new apps, which have their own new infrastructure needs, and so on in an upward spiral. That certainly seems to apply to USDC’s development.\n\nCircle built the infrastructure, and started working with developers who were building applications to see how USDC could help. And then suddenly, DeFi Summer happened.\n\nThe explosion in DeFi’s popularity – led by protocols like Uniswap, Compound, Aave, and Maker – created an explosion in the developer ecosystem, and interest in embedding USDC in all of the new things they were creating. DeFi developers came to Circle with ideas – “We want to wrap USDC, but make it yield-bearing,” for example – and the Circle team said, “Go for it!” Since USDC is permissionless, Circle doesn’t give or refuse permission anyway, but they were psyched to see developers building new things with their primitive.\n\nUSDC adoption has driven Circle’s meteoric rise. In May 2021, with USDC’s market cap just above $20 billion, Circle announced a $440 million funding round from Fidelity, FTX, Digital Currency Group, and more. Later that year, it signed an agreement with SPAC Concord Acquisition Corp. to take it public at $4 billion. This February, it announced that the SPAC valuation more than doubled to $9 billion, and in April, it announced a $400 million round led by BlackRock and Fidelity, as USDC’s market cap grew to  $51 billion. There have been no recent announcements regarding the SPAC, and it’s possible that the deal expires before it gets to market given the current market reception of both crypto and SPACs.\n\nToday, while DeFi activity has cooled off, Joao told me that USDC itself, with its scale, gravity, and strength during the crash, is as close as it’s been in its entire journey to behaving like a platform.\n\nHow are USDC and Circle a Platform?\n\nWhen I first spoke to Jeremy, he told me that from the beginning, Circle wanted to build the http or smtp for money, protocols that are open, that anyone can connect to, but that allow for some things that http and smtp don’t, namely moving value and settling transactions.\n\nThe manifestation of that vision changed as Circle iterated its way towards product-market fit, but the vision itself remained consistent through the creation of USDC.\n\n“When we launched USDC,” he explained, “The concept was that the best way to launch was as a protocol that anyone can build on top of.”\n\nCircle needed to provide the dollar liquidity and market infrastructure, regulated infrastructure that connects bank money and US Treasury bonds with entities it onboards in a compliant way. Once USDC was in circulation, the combination of tokens and the protocol became a platform that anyone could build on top of.\n\nNow, the Circle team is focused on creating better infrastructure that abstracts away a lot of the complexity for developers and users, and on expanding the suite of stablecoins it offers.\n\nIt’s weird to think of digital money as a platform, but it works.\n\nThe other day, I was on a call with Joris Delanoue, the founder of Fairmint. Today, the company lets US companies issue equity in exchange for time & effort or a cash investment. The company is web2.5 – investments on Fairmint are compliant securities and the front-end feels very web2, but in the backend, it uses USDC and smart contracts to facilitate smoother, faster, cheaper transactions.\n\n“The USDC stablecoin is absolutely key to blurring the border between on- and off-chain,” Joris explained when my ears perked up, “It’s reliable and properly backed 1:1, and it lets us deliver a 10x better experience when dealing with (crytpo-native) securities.”\n\nNear the end of the call, after we went through all of the progress they’d made on the product, he threw in as an aside: “Oh, and we’re actually looking at the European market now that Euro Coin launched.” That’s a big unlock from a simple coin.\n\nThat conversation was the first time that USDC’s role as a platform clicked, but Fairmint is just one example of the many companies, both web3 and traditional, that are building on top of USDC today. Party Round, a Not Boring Capital portfolio company, lets companies raise, and investors invest, in both USDC and fiat. When I asked CEO Jordi Hays why they use USDC, he pointed to demand from both founders and investors, and said that it just makes the experience smoother: “A company can raise money from 50 people in 50 countries as easily as they could raise from 50 angel investors in the US. Instant is big. Global is big. 24/7 is big.”\n\nEstablished companies like Visa, MoneyGram, Twitter, and Stripe are working with USDC to facilitate crypto payments, too.\n\nIn March 2021, Visa announced that it had become the first major payments network to settle transactions in USDC, writing:\n\nVisa’s standard settlement process requires partners to settle in a traditional fiat currency, which can add cost and complexity for businesses built with digital currencies. The ability to settle in USDC can ultimately help [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) and other crypto native companies evaluate fundamentally new business models without the need for traditional fiat in their treasury and settlement workflows.\n\nVisa’s partnership is an important stamp of approval for USDC – Visa is a $427 billion market cap global leader in moving money – and is still in the early innings, focused on settling money within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nStripe pushed the ball a bit further, towards non-crypto-native platforms and users. In April 2022, Stripe announced that it was introducing global crypto payouts, starting with Twitter creators, with USDC on top of Polygon. Stripe highlighted that crypto payouts will let platforms “quickly pay out to their users in even more countries, and improve their services for those who prefer crypto over traditional fiat payment methods.”\n\nWorking with established companies, which are often more conservative than their web3 counterparts, has pushed Circle to answer more sophisticated questions. Speaking with people at Stripe, it’s clear that they’re not just going to do crypto to do crypto; they need to understand how it works down to the most minute detail. Joao said that web2 and traditional payments companies are a lot more focused on questions like, “Which chain should we use? Or should we use multiple? If we use multiple, how exactly does bridging work and is it secure?”\n\nThey also have more demanding requirements. “For USDC to be an actual platform for millions of developers,” Joao highlighted, “We need to build out infrastructure that other financial platforms have.”\n\nCircle plans to build out a lot of new infrastructure on-chain, and is particularly focused on how to raise the level of abstraction for developers. For example, Stripe is starting with Polygon, but plans to expand to more blockchains later this year:\n\nStripe\nThat infrastructure should make it so easy to use USDC cross-chain that which chain a developer or user wants to use should be an implementation detail. As Joao put it, “If there’s a merchant who wants to receive USDC on Solana, but the payer is on Ethereum, we want to make that happen easily. We’ll need to abstract away things like bridges, exchanges, gas costs, and more to make it happen.”\n\nIt might also build out specific SDKs that make it easy for web2 and web3 companies to build products around USDC. “The web2 opportunity is huge.”\n\nThink about the apps you use every day. Twitter, which consumes \\~99.99% of my app time, is already connected to USDC via Stripe. Many of the most popular apps – like Uber and Airbnb – have wallets built-in, even though you might not think of them like that.\n\nUber (left) and Airbnb (Right)\nCurrently, those companies need to register in multiple jurisdictions and set up different banks based on where they operate. Airbnb, for example, is an e-money company in Europe and needs to hold and maintain a license to hold customer balances. Building with something like a Circle wallet SDK, they might be able to let users self-custody, top up their accounts, and spend frictionlessly with much less headache for both Uber & Airbnb, and for users.\n\nThose are pretty straightforward examples, and there are a lot of similar opportunities to build financial products for directly or indirectly financial web2 apps, but the bigger opportunity will likely arise from all of the new companies that couldn’t have been built before.\n\nAs Circle builds out tools and infrastructure to traditional companies’ more exacting standards, developers in web3 will get access to those same capabilities, without ever needing to talk to a human at Circle.  The infrastructure Circle creates, and USDC itself, are open, interoperable, and permissionless.\n\nThere are some obvious challenges that need to be solved to get to a place where stablecoin rails replace the 20th century Fortran-based infrastructure that the financial system is built on top of today. On– and off- ramps, from fiat to crypto and back, need to get smoother. There need to be more options for custody between a Coinbase account and full self-custody with an 18-word seed phrase, like Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and social recovery. Options for refundable transactions will need to be made available. Circle can build some of this into its APIs and SDKs, and the developer ecosystem as a whole will keep developing new solutions to the known challenges.\n\nThere will need to be more regional stablecoins, too, representing the Pound, Yen, and hundreds of other fiat currencies used around the world in order for stablecoins’ global potential to be realized. There, too, Circle expects to build in certain cases and partner in others.\n\nCircle plans to keep creating new, regulated, fully-backed stablecoins and better, smoother infrastructure, creating a platform on top of which anyone with an internet connection and some skills can build. It can give those tools to developers for free while still building a massive, profitable business because of the way it makes money. It even has a venture arm, Circle Ventures, that invests in products in the ecosystem that leverage USDC in order to accelerate development in the space.\n\nIn fact, Circle is incentivized to make it as cheap, safe, and easy as possible for anyone to build on top of USDC, EUROC, and future stablecoins because Circle makes more money when more of its stablecoins are in circulation.\n\nCircle has iterated its way into one of the best business models on the internet.\n\nWhat is Circle’s Competitive Advantage?\nHere’s the beauty of Circle’s business model: it charges customers nothing, which increases its scale, and makes more money as it gets bigger by investing its reserves in safe assets.\n\nIn many ways, Circle is an example of what Chris Burniske calls Protocols as Minimally Extractive Coordinators. In it, he writes: “The less extractive a protocol is in coordinating exchange, the more that form of exchange will happen.”\n\nWhen dollars are converted into bits and bytes, friction and transaction costs go down. Since Circle doesn’t charge developers or users to use USDC – since it’s minimally extractive – more exchange should happen in USDC. As more exchange happens in USDC, and more USDC circulates, Circle holds conservative reserves to ensure that liquidity is always on hand to redeem USDC for a dollar at par. The portion of those reserves held in US Treasuries, I would assume, generate income for Circle, without needing to charge users or developers.\n\nThat’s why, in addition to what I believe are the team’s genuine ambitions to create a better, faster, cheaper, and more open financial system, a stablecoin company can pour resources into building out infrastructure that it gives away for free. It’s building a platform business that monetizes through interest on reserves instead of fees.\n\nUSDC is building network effects that boggle the mind, and come from two sources: the platform and the money itself.\n\nThinking about USDC as a platform, it has classic network effects that are somewhere between Marketplace (2-sided) and Platform (2-sided) network effects as described in NFX’s Network Effects Manual.\n\nNFX: The Network Effects Manual\nWithout going too deep into the weeds on the differences – which come from whether supply builds for just one platform or multiple – Circle’s flywheels look like this:\n\nFirst, as more developers build on USDC, USDC gains more utility (it can be used to transact in more products), which creates more demand for circulation, which creates an incentive for more developers to build on and integrate with USDC. It becomes the de facto starting point for developers and partners looking to build with stablecoins.\n\nThe second network effect comes from the money itself. Specifically, the more USDC there is in circulation, the more utility it has. A simple way to think about this is that $1 million is worthless if you’re the only person in the world who uses dollars, but very useful if everyone uses dollars.\n\nThis is classic Metcalfe’s Law: the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants in the network.\n\nThe bigger and more widely used USDC becomes, the more valuable it is to everyone who uses it and to all of the developers who build on it. And because its platform is money and therefore it’s able to give away its infrastructure practically for free and monetize its reserves, Circle should be able to grow developer and user adoption faster than web2 platforms and APIs that need to charge users to build sustainable businesses.\n\nThis is Circle’s competitive advantage against tech challengers, but it might soon face a much larger competitor.\n\nOne of the perceived challenges to USDC is that the US government might issue a Central Bank Digital Currency (“CBDC”) in part to maintain the dollar’s position as the global reserve currency in an increasingly digital economy. China is going that route with the e-CNY. Circle believes that USDC and other commercial dollar-backed stablecoins give the US the best of both worlds: the innovation benefits of an open, competitive, capitalist ecosystem that also increases demand for USD as all USDC are redeemable 1:1 for USD. If you’ve been reading Not Boring, you know which approach I think makes the most sense, but it might not be either-or.\n\nDante Disparte, Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Global Policy, believes that CBDCs and commercial dollar-backed stablecoins can co-exist.\n\n“What we’re building for,” he told me, “is something cross-border versus domestic. USDC is internet-scale and designed for open, permissionless, more equitable economic activity on the internet. A CBDC is invariably domestic and transmits the risk to the taxpayer.” Earlier this month, Dante wrote Borderless money in a hot, flat, and crowded world to lay out his position in more detail, and last week, Circle’s VP of Policy & Regulatory Strategy Teana Baker-Taylor dropped a thread on the view that private and public digital money can co-exist:\n\nTwitter avatar for @TeanaTaylor\nTeana Baker-Taylor\n@TeanaTaylor\nRight now, at least 105 central banks, representing \\~95% of global GDP, are evaluating creating a CBDC.\n\nQuestion I receive daily:\nWhat happens to #stablecoins when #CBDC's come online?\n\nMy short answer: public & private money co-exist today.\nBut...🧵👇🏻\nJuly 14th 2022\n\n8 Retweets28 Likes\nTime will tell, but the government might be less of a competitor than it is a complement.\n\nIn fact, Circle’s skill and experience working with governments is its second source of competitive advantage.\n\nIn addition to the advantages that Circle gets with scale, it has a regulatory and compliance advantage over new entrants and existing competitors. Over the past nine years, it has poured resources and countless hours into building out best-in-class internal compliance, getting all of the necessary licenses to operate in the US and abroad, and working with policymakers to craft sensible legislation. It’s had to convince conservative companies like BNY Mellon, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, not to mention top insurance companies and auditing firms, to work with it. In doing so, and operating to a high bar, it’s established strong relationships with key players.\n\nIf it seemed fairly certain that regulators would crack down on risky stablecoins, like Luna’s UST, before the recent meltdown, it’s all but guaranteed now. It’s clear that stablecoins will be regulated, and that stablecoin issuers will be held to the highest standards. Circle is working to make sure that, as Jeremy described it, “policies don’t put the genie back in the bottle.”\n\nIn a more regulated space, Circle’s trust will be an even bigger competitive advantage, as Dante explained:\n\nFor some, the feature in stablecoins was opacity, lack of regulation, frictionlessness — all interesting during good times, but when you’re running for the exit and looking for redemption is when trust matters most. You can’t buy insurance when your house is on fire. We’ve been doing things that will increasingly become the global regulatory standard well before it was a requirement.\n\nHe believes that we’ll see thoughtful, pro-innovation regulation from the US Government and that regulators will see the importance of “same risk, same rules” in creating “more optionality in payment systems rather than disrupting and disintermediating banks.”\n\nWhile the government can’t regulate math, it can and will regulate the behaviors of firms issuing stablecoins. And when it does, Circle has a near-decade-long headstart.\n\nIn order to compete with Circle, new fiat-backed stablecoin issuers will not only need to overcome its strong network effects, scale economies, and cash generation machine, they’ll need to do so while building up the compliance infrastructure, and trust, that Circle has.\n\nAre the barriers to entry high? Yes. But Jeremy pointed out that there were high barriers to entry in competing with Facebook, too, before Instagram and TikTok came along. Ultimately, the company seems willing to support and partner with anyone in the space who can contribute to building a new, internet-native financial system.\n\nWhat Would a New Financial System Built on Circle’s Rails Look like?\nIf you were to design a new financial system today, from scratch, with all of the existing technologies, how would you design it?\n\nThere’s another benefit of stablecoins, specifically fully-reserved stablecoins like USDC and DAI, that we haven’t touched upon but that’s worth highlighting: separating the payment function of money from the lending function of money.\n\nToday, both governments and banks can create money. Governments create a certain amount, people and businesses put their money in bank accounts, and then banks can lend out multiples of that money based on reserve requirements. That’s called “fractional reserve banking,” and the amount that banks can lend out relative to deposits is dictated by the Liquidity Coverage Ratio laid out in Basel III. (If you want to have a wild time, you can read all 75 pages here.)\n\nThere are issues with a fractional reserve banking system, as seen during the Global Financial Crisis, but Basel III goes a long way towards fixing them. As with anything when I write about web3, I don’t think the benefit is in taking down big evil corporations for the sake of it, banks included. I worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great people. Instead, to me, one of the main benefits is who the value can accrue to when you remove those middlemen.\n\nWhen you deposit your money at a bank, they lend it out over and over, and earn interest for doing so. I haven’t checked my account recently, but the interest is typically comically low (and they charge me a $5/mo “maintenance fee”!). The four biggest banks in the US alone – JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo – generated a combined $173 billion in net interest income in 2021.\n\nSource: Company Filings\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income a bank earns from lending and the interest it pays out to depositors. Presumably, those numbers will go up this year in a rising interest rate environment; depositors don’t care enough to move banks for a few extra basis points.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with banks making money. It’s their job, and a lot of smart people have built out a lot of sophisticated infrastructure to do it well. But it is an opportunity for challengers. In the bull case for DeFi, that $173 billion represents the value available to be either made by lenders or saved by borrowers. The math is rough – on one side, there are a lot more banks in the world, and on the other, fully reserved means fewer loans for each dollar, among other factors – but directionally correct as a starting point.\n\nThe difference is that in this system, the net interest income should go to the people who own the dollars, not to banks. With stablecoins, anyone can plug into a DeFi lending protocol and lend money to generate returns higher than 0.01%, or whatever they’d earn in their savings account.\n\nFor this opportunity to even sniff the TradFi interest income opportunity, a lot needs to happen. For one, DeFi will need to begin to touch real world assets (RWA) like cars, small businesses, and yes, mortgages. There are a lot of challenges there, but there are also a lot of smart people working to solve them.\n\nThe technological building blocks are starting to come into place, but the biggest headwind won’t be the technology, it will be the law. City Councils will need to recognize NFT Titles. The Federal government will need to come out with clear regulation. Battles will be fought in the court. “This happened with the internet, too,” Jeremy pointed out, before the internet became the fabric of everything that it is today.\n\nIn interviews, Jeremy applauds the US government’s approach to regulating the internet. When it was first taking off, government officials talked about making people and businesses apply to be able to create a website, but luckily, they chose to let it remain open. The internet we know and love today owes a debt of gratitude to those early regulatory decisions. Today, stablecoin regulation is at the same inflection point internet regulation was at two decades ago.\n\nOpen or closed?\n\nGovernment-run (Central Bank Digital Currency or “CBDC”) or commercial?\n\nAs more people begin to use stablecoins to transact and borrow and lend and get paid and do all sorts of things online, as consumers get more comfortable with the technology, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll want to go back to the way things were.\n\nThey’ll want to tap into liquid global pools of capital to borrow money to buy a house at a lower rate than they can get from a bank, instantly and permissionlessly, and they’ll want to be able to directly earn more from their money than they’re able to get from their bank account. This will likely eventually be true in the US, and it will likely be useful to people in other countries, where mortgages are harder to come by and more expensive, far sooner.\n\nAs leading DeFi protocols continue to demonstrate their sturdiness in volatile markets, and as the interfaces improve, consumers and institutions alike will get more comfortable with this online financial system. That will take time, and a lot needs to be built and worked out.\n\nBut all of the current problems are solvable problems, particularly when the goal isn’t “total decentralization,” but rather “more widespread access on smoother rails.” Some people will go full DeFi, others will work with lenders who build some pieces on USDC rails. As with Circle itself, there will be a trade-off: some centralization in exchange for a range of improvements over the current system.\n\nAs always, the most impactful innovations will likely be the ones we haven’t even dreamed up. “There are huge categories that haven’t been created or even thought of,” Jeremy said:\n\nWe have programmable money, dollars as a native data type, a protocol you can use to interact, and computation environments (smart contracts) to write code that interacts with all of that. We have transparent, open, risk-managed credit facilities on the internet. We’re getting close to the point where USDC and other stables can transact with sub-second finality for a penny or two.\n\nWhat can you do with all of that? I don’t know! We’re in the very early stages of discovering what people can build.\n\nOne thing is clear: to reach mass adoption, we’ll need better interfaces. An app that Jeremy thinks we’ll see, and will need to see for widespread adoption, is a superapp like Tencent’s WeChat that combines Decentralized Identity, Decentralized Social, messaging, stablecoins, payments, the ability to interact with tokenized IP, one view of the NFTs that have utility for you (and links to the places those NFTs have utility via tokengated commerce), and more. “But in order for that product to exist,” he said, “the things that provide those services need to exist.”\n\nUSDC is just one piece of infrastructure. For Circle to achieve its mission – to raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value - there will need to be advances in commerce that uses NFTs, entitlements, reputation, identity, scalable zero-knowledge technology, and more. Jeremy readily admits that the current model where people can see your transaction history is not going to work.\n\nBut he’s optimistic that we’ll get to a place where USDC is baked into a new financial and internet system that was built in and for the internet age. I agree.\n\nThere’s a popular narrative among web3 skeptics that we don’t need crypto because banks and fintechs work just fine. Why would you need to send money abroad with stablecoins when something like Wise exists? I’m a big fan of, and investor in, fintech companies. Moving money has gotten much better in the last decade.\n\nBut the skeptics’ belief is essentially that we’ve reached the end of the road when it comes to financial innovation – that the FORTRAN and COBOL-based rails work just fine, and that it’s not worth trying to build new rails on technology developed in the past decade.\n\nThat is insane to me, and ignores the history of both financial and technological innovation. Of course the financial system will be refactored – whether it takes a few years or a few decades – and it seems as if USDC will be a big part of that.\n\nAt the same time, I don’t think that stablecoins will replace banks or fintechs. Sometimes, they’ll co-exist. Increasingly, as is already happening, fintechs will build smoother, faster, cheaper, more global products on USDC rails, and provide the necessary guardrails, compliance, interfaces, and all sorts of other things that fintechs do best.\n\nAnd it won’t just be fintechs. As money and banking become embedded in more of the products we use every day, and new categories of products are created with new technologies, I expect that USDC will be a core piece of more and more companies’ tech stacks. That would mean more USDC in circulation, larger USDC reserves, and more interest income for Circle, without needing to push out the risk curve.\n\nTaking the trust-first approach, and building a platform, isn’t the fastest way to get rich. But it’s the safest, and it’s the only way to ensure that USDC lives up to its creators’ vision of raising global prosperity, a world in which Circle’s technology powers a modern, more fair financial system.", "timestamp": 1658539114, "digest": "m2gamT1c0znW6y3fcMKPnnweyNeMcNWLx6iNDVek95A", "contributor": "0x54664c16c3f5D0BC33bf914bC82dA9A2275f0EA2"}

Token 争夺市场》\n\n撰文：汤圆\n\n目前，在以太坊的 Layer2（L2）扩容解决方案中，采用 Rollup 技术的方案已经成为主流，并以不同的共识机制形成了已经落地的 L2 网络，主流网络代表 Optimism、Arbitrum、ZkSync 和 StarkNet。\n\n随着网络建成后应用的迁移，L2 网络开始陷入加密资产锁仓的争夺战中。\n\n数据网站 L2Beat 显示，截至 7 月 20 日，整个 L2 网络中锁仓的加密资产价值（TVL）由高到低的网络分别为 Arbitrum > Optimism > ZkSync > StarkNet。\n\nStarkNet 在落后的局面下开始效仿其他 L2 网络，将原生 Token 的发行提上了日程，要知道，激励在区块链世界是最好的引流手段。7 月 13 日，区块链扩容技术服务商 StarkWare 连发三篇博客，介绍其 Layer2 扩容网络 StarkNet 的原生 Token，包括经济治理模型、应用场景、发行数量及分配情况等。\n\n更早前的 4 月，Optimism 发行了原生 Token OP，并于 5 月 30 日正式上线二级市场。发行 OP 后的 Optimism 在 TVL 上开始凸显优势。\n\n尚未发行 Token 的 Rollup 系 L2 网络仅剩 Arbitrum 和 ZkSync，但从近期和过去的生态动态看，Token 发行也是迟早的事。\n\nZkSync 早在官方的用户文档中表态将会发行 Token，但未透露具体的发行时间并未透露。打开 ZkSync 用户文档页面，第一条就是关于「是否会有 Token」的提问，官方答案为「Yes」。\n\nArbitrum 没有明确表示将会发行 Token， 但它在 4 月 20 日发布了名为「The Arbitrum Odyssey」的生态探索活动，鼓励用户使用链上项目获得 NFT 奖励。不少用户猜测，参与活动、获得 NFT 奖励很有可能 Arbitrum 为之后发行 Token 设置的「用户领取资格」门槛。\n\n的确，使用链上应用形成的交互痕迹往往会成为用户获得 Token 空投的资格线。本期 DeFi 蜂窝将梳理 Rullup 系的四大 L2 网络（Optimism、Arbitrum、ZkSync 和 StarkNet）的链上生态情况。\n\nOptimistic Rollup 系 L2 网络的 TVL 更高\n\n既能保证区块链网络安全、又能提高网络吞吐量的 Rollup 技术，正在成为以太坊 Layer2 (L2) 扩容解决方案的主流技术。基于该技术形成的解决方案又因为共识算法的不同形成了 Optimistic Rollup 和 ZK Rollup 两大流派，且这两种解决方案都有了已经落地的 L2 网络。\n\n目前，Optimistic Rollup 的 L2 代表网络是 Optimism 和 Arbitrum；ZK Rollup 方案的 L2 落地网络的主要选手是 StarkNet 和 zkSync。\n\n根据 L2Beat 显示，截至 7 月 20 日，整个 L2 网络中锁仓的加密资产价值（TVL）为 43.6 亿美元，其中 Arbitrum 链上 TVL 为 21.5 亿美元，市场份额占比为 54%，排名第一；次之的是 Optimism，链上 TVL 为 7.6 亿美元；ZkSync 链上 TVL 仅为 6100 万美元；StarkNet 更少，链上 TVL 目前只有 70 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HQAHEKtmyjAEmgXH3S5MO.png?height=582&width=882)\n\nL2 网络 TVL 及市场份额数据\n\n可以看出，ZK Rollup 系的 zkSync 和 StarkNet，在 TVL、市场份额方面都远不如 Optimistic Rollup 系的 Optimism 和 Arbitrum。\n\n这主要是因为 Optimism 和 Arbitrum 的主网具有先发优势。Arbitrum 主网早在去年 8 月就正式上线，Optimism 主网于去年 7 月上线。而 ZK Rollup 系的 ZkSync 网络 1.0 版本虽在去年 7 月份上线，但由于底层技术原因，使用场景仅限于支付，直到今年 2 月公布的 zkSync 2.0 才兼容以太坊虚拟机（EVM），适合开发者使用；而 StarkNet 主网还一直处于公开测试阶段，并未正式上线。\n\nZK Rollup 系的网络落地要稍慢于另一派系，这主要是因为基于「零知识证明算法」的 ZK Rollup 技术方案较为复杂，落地需要时间。更重要的是，该系列的 L2 网络与 EVM 的兼容方面一直难有突破，直到 zkSync 2.0 版本出现才有了新转机，声称能够做到 99% 兼容。L2 网络与 EVM 的兼容直接关系到应用开发者的时间和经济成本，而没有应用的区块链网络很难吸引用户及资产。\n\n相反，Optimistic Rollup 系的 Arbitrum 能够做到完全兼容 EVM，支持以太坊链上的去中心化应用程序（DApp）直接迁移，目前，Uniswap、Curve、Aave、1inch 等以太坊的头部 DeFi 应用都在该网络上集成。Optimism 也在去年 11 月完成了与 EVM 完全兼容的升级。\n\nOptimism 先发代币\n\n在 TVL 上排名前两位的 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 网络，在生态布局上各具特色，发展路线也各不相同，前者更注重用户体验，后者则在发行了原生代币后实现了 TVL 的增长。\n\n说起来，Optimism 主网上线时间要早 Arbitrum 一个月。但去年 7 月，该网络上线时还没有做到 100% 兼 EVM，不能实现以太坊链上的 DApp 一键迁移，链上生态发展被后来者 Arbitrum 赶超。\n\n去年 11 月，Optimism 部署的 OVM 虚拟机 2.0 版本与 EVM 实现了完全等效，还能简化开发者的开发过程，降低费用，该网络的链上生态这才正式「发芽」。\n\n但是在早期，Optimism 链上应用主要围绕合成资产协议 Synthetix 来衍生新产品，由于这类产品多为复杂的期权、合约等 DeFi 金融衍生品，对于普通交易用户来说不易操作，更合适专业交易员使用。因此，该链上应用未能吸引大量用户和资金。\n\n直到今年 4 月 27 日，Optimism 公布了原生代币 OP 的发行方案后，用户的注意力才被吸引而来，它也是基于 Rollup 技术框架下的第一个发行代币的 L2 网络。\n\nOP 发行总量约为 42.9 亿个，总供应量将以每年 2% 的速度膨胀，主要用于社区治理、投票权和项目激励。总量 19% 的 OP 将空投给用户，其中首轮给社区空投了 5%，另外 14% 将在未来分配。\n\nOP 在空投后迅速上线二级市场，形成了交易价格，最高冲至 2 美元。有数据显示，OP 的最低空投数量为 409.42 个，按照高点价格，OP 最低空投价值约为 800 美元。早期用户的财富效应迅速吸引了市场注意，外部用户开始参与其生态，希望能在下波 OP 空投中被选中。\n\n在完成首轮空投后的 6 月 9 日，Optimism 拿出了 2.31 亿 OP 创建了激励基金，旨在资助 OP 生态系统中的建设者和项目，通过项目的 TVL、日交易量等指标决定 OP 的激励数量。\n\nToken 激励计划成功将用户和项目引入 Optimism 生态。据 Optimism 浏览器数据显示，6 月 2 日，也就是创建激励基金消息的一周前，该链上的日交易数最高冲至 48.7 万笔，日增地址数为 3.9 万。截至 7 月 20 日，该网络的链上地址数共有 121 万。\n\n代表应用\n\nOptimism Bridge——Optimism 官方跨链桥，支持将以太坊、Polygon、BSC 等 L1 公链以及 L2 网络 Arbitrum 上的资产跨链至 Optimism。\n\nLayerswap—— 加密资产从中心化交易所（CEX）直接提取至 L2 网络的工具，由加密支付基础服务商 Bransfer 开发。\n\nSynthetix（SNX）生态 —— 它原是建立在以太坊上的合成资产发行及交易应用，用户可通过超额抵押治理通证 SNX 生成各类合成资产。\n\n2021 年 9 月，Synthetix 宣布将应用从以太坊主网迁移至 Optimism 网络中，它成为第一个支持该 L2 网络的以太坊头部应用。其中 sUSD、sETH、sBTC、sLINK 等合成资产已经成为以太坊和 Optimism 网络上的主流资产。\n\nSynthetix 基于这些合成资产在 Optimism 网络上搭建了多个应用场景，包括合成资产综合交易平台 Kwenta、期权交易平台 Lyra、一站式期权投资平台 Polynomial、资产管理平台 dHEDGE、衍生品交易平台 Thales 等。\n\nZipSwap（ZIP）——Optimism 网络原生的去中心化交易应用（DEX），它基于 Uniswap v2 版本的代码构建，希望能为 Optimism 用户提供一个低费用的资产兑换场所。\n\nQuixotic——Optimism 原生的最大的 NFT 交易平台。\n\nArbitrum 死磕用户体验\n\nOP 的发行确实为 Optimism 生态带来了资金流量，但该网络的 TVL 仍然逊于仅比它晚一个月诞生的 Arbitrum，这又是为何？\n\nArbitrum 由 Offchain Labs 团队开发，尽管没有发行 Token，但同样注重激励。今年 4 月 20 日，官方公布了名为「The Arbitrum Odyssey」生态项目探索活动计划，该活动的主要目的是以 NFT 来激励用户与生态应用交互，让用户通过执行链上任务来了解和体验链上 DApp 的使用。\n\n活动为期 8 周，鼓励用户交互的应用覆盖了跨链桥、DeFi 和 NFT、游戏等多种场景，用户可以体验每期列出的应用，并完成相关任务，获得官方提供的 NFT。有不少用户猜测，NFT 很有可能会是 Arbitrum 发行代币后的空投资格凭证。\n\n6 月 22 日，The Arbitrum Odyssey 发起了首期活动，成功吸引了流量。根据 Arbiscan 浏览器显示，6 月 27 日，该链上日交易次数为 28.7 万笔，新增地址数为 5.6 万。用户的激增一度导致 Arbitrum 链上出现了严重拥堵，Gas 费升高。\n\n据 L2fees 数据，6 月 29 日，在 Arbitrum 网络上，每笔交易的平均 Gas 费用最高时飙至 9 美元以上，高于同期以太坊主网的 Gas 费两倍，参与用户的怨声沸腾。随后，Arbitrum 官方宣布暂停了活动。\n\n在提升用户体验层面上，Arbitrum 甚至开发了新链。7 月 12 日，该网络宣布构建了新链「Arbitrum Nova」, 目前已在以太坊主网运行，开发人员可在该链上部署相关应用程序。\n\n如此一来，Arbitrum 就变成了双链生态 ——Arbitrum One 和 Arbitrum Nova，前者是现有的主网，后者基于 AnyTrust 技术搭建，专为游戏、社交应用程序和对成本更敏感的用例而设计。\n\n之所以推出 Arbitrum Nova 链，是因为主网 Arbitrum One 因为底层共识算法的原因存在数据异议期，直接结果是用户将 Token 提回至以太坊网络时需要 7 天的等待期，影响用户体验的同时，对高吞吐量要求的应用场景也不够友好。\n\nArbitrum Nova 适合对成本敏感、有高交易量预期的应用场景，比如游戏和社交应用程序，而 Arbitrum One 将继续覆盖 DeFi 和 NFT 项目。\n\n代表应用\n\nHop Protocol 跨链桥 —— 主要支持加密资产在 L2 网络和 L1 网络之间的转移。\n\nArbitrum bridge——Arbitrum 官方跨链桥，支持以太坊资产跨链至 Arbitrum 网络，需要注意，资产从 L2 返回 L1 需要 7 天等待期。\n\nGMX—— 建立在 Arbitrum 链上的去中心化永续合约交易应用。\n\nTreasure DAO——Arbitrum 上的元宇宙和 NFT 基础层平台，融合了 NFT、DeFi 和 GameFi 应用。\n\nStargate—— 基于 LayerZero 协议开发的跨链应用，主要专注于原生资产跨链。\n\nZkSync 注重改进网络性能\n\n对于 Rollup 技术，以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin 多次在公开场合表示，ZK Rollup 是 L2 的终极之选，但由于其底层技术比较复杂，落地还需很长时间。\n\n基于 ZK Rollup 技术的 L2 网络中，StarkNet 和 zkSync 是主要代表，尽管在开发进度、生态数据表现上，二者都落后于 Optimistic Rollup 技术派的 L2，但由于能实现即时到账，依旧被外界看好。尤其是能够兼容 EVM 的 zkSync 2.0 的上线，开发进度已经超出了业内预期。\n\nzkSync 网络由 Matter Labs 团队搭建，其所有产品都开源，更偏向于社区化运营。Matter Labs 甚至多次表示出「自己被替代掉也无所谓」，目的只在推动以太坊社区发展。在发展路线上，该团队一直在致力于改进网络，提升性能。\n\nzkSync1.0 版本于 2020 年 6 月上线，主要聚焦于支付。由于不兼容 EVM，网络的可用性受到限制，能支持的应用场景非常有限。但由于转账费用低，到账即时，在支付场景上展现了优越性。\n\n今年 2 月，zkSync 2.0 版本的公共测试网上线，实现了 EVM 兼容，大概率会成为首个利用 ZK Rollup 方案并兼容 EVM 的区块链网络。zkSync2.0 支持开发人员使用以太坊原生编程语言 Solidity 在网络上部署 DApp，以太坊主网上现有的 DeFi 应用也可以集成至 zkSync2.0 网络上，享受 L2 网络带来的高效和低费优势。\n\n不过，zkSync2.0 的正式主网一直没有上线，有用户猜测，其主网上线很可能会和发行 Token 同时。当然，实际情况还需要等待官方消息。\n\n代表应用\n\n去中心化交易应用 ZigZag—— 采用订单簿模型的 DEX，试图成为中心化交易所（CEX）在链上的替代方案。\n\n跨链桥 Orbiter Finance—— 应用于 L2 网络，支持 zkSync、Arbitrum、Optimism 等 L2 网络间的资产跨链转移，也支持 L2 和 L1 网络间的资产互转。\n\nSyncSwap——zkSync 网络上原生的 DEX，目前还在测试中。\n\nStarkNet 将发行 Token\n\nStarkNet 由 StarkWare 公司搭建，它通过产品化的思路为 L2 解决扩容问题。\n\nStarkWare 公司创建于 2018 年，有一套完整的 L2 系统解决方案，在为以太坊扩容方面，它产出了 StarkNet（L2 网络）和 StarkEx（扩容引擎）两个落地产品。\n\nStarkEx 是一套可扩容的引擎技术，专门为以太坊 DApp 应用提供服务，本质上是一个连接 L1 与 L2 的数据处理器。该技术已经服务了不少知名的 DApp，包括去中心化永续合约交易应用 dYdX、去中心化交易应用 DeversiFi、NFT 生态系统 Immutable X 等。\n\nStarkNet 是一个通用的 L2 网络，测试网已于 2021 年 11 月上线，支持开发者进行应用部署。由于 StarkNet 还未兼容 EVM，因此，它一直没有获得以太坊头部应用的迁移，生态一直不瘟不火。\n\n如此状态下，StarkNet 决定发行 Token。\n\n7 月 13 日，StarkWare 连续发布 3 篇博客，介绍了 StarkNet 的原生代币，包括 Token 的经济治理模型、应用场景、发行数量及分配情况等，并表示 StarkNet 网络已经铸造了 100 亿枚代币，开始分配给 StarkNet 生态的贡献者及相关投资人。\n\n按照计划，StarkNet 的代币在今年 9 月以 ERC-20 标准在以太坊上流通，并在未来作为 StarkNet 网络 Gas 费的唯一支付手段。目前，StarkNet 网络 Gas 费以 ETH 结算。\n\n代表应用\n\n跨链桥 StarkGate—— 官方跨链桥，支持 L1 资产存入 StarkNet 网络中。\n\n一站式交易应用 JediSwap——StarkNet 上的自动做市商（AMM）机制的去中心化交易应用。\n\nStarkswap——StarkNet 上原生的 AMM 式 DEX。\n\n永续合约应用 ZKX——Starknet 上第一个去中心化金融衍生品应用，今年 7 月 18 日获得了 450 万美元的种子轮融资。\n\nZklend—— 去中心化借贷应用，今年 3 月完成了 500 万美元种子轮融资。\n\n来源链接", "timestamp": 1658539385, "digest": "chsM7Sj7IHsmV54kHkHuFc7vvSgiIbWqiXmgOUh_5ik", "contributor": "0xa9E79b67303334C7b24f2CCcAC3B4635183F6c29"}

"加密世界已然浮现多起，伴随着这个行业的熊熊轮回，也伴随着混乱的生机。项目的“兴衰”持续进化、生长。\n\n上一天的大牛市中，再一次是我们到了Layer1、Berana、街头的大价值。城市的价值发展迅速，年轻人迅速发展成熟，各种高速增长的同时应用，在链上也发现了基础市场的价值。\n\n时过这些日子，历经数月的洗礼，第一层中的大多数项目都表现出第一层的情况，然而，在过去的一段时间里，却一直过往的环境中，仍然拥有相当强的白日牛市），结合“每一轮的轮回、项目都将诞生于上一轮高亮的城市”的历史，此时开发阶段我们更应该把时间投射到更早的时候尚早的全新Layer1们。\n\n业内人士看来，“熊市级，牛市级”的目前来看，综合一级市场动态来看，新一代Layer1即将成为新机构的聚焦点，Aptos、Sui等明星项目都即将完成完成数亿美元等级的融资。\n\n为了帮助大家清楚地捕捉到Layer1O赛场的最新发展趋势，每日星球从近半年内走入大众视野且尚未发币的新兴Layer1入选中榜10家较具代表性的项目，项目组等，我们真正的应用情况、亮点、最新进展未来手机对Layer1进行\n\n提前说明是，但只是某个组中需要出现的项目均基于融资情况、始创背景、市场热度等因素筛选而出，保证项目最终能够以较早的阶段完成项目，因此无法如期顺利完成发展，并成功打开市场，因此不组合投资建议。\n\n**Aptos： 最强势的新生代 Layer1**\n\n2019 年，Facebook 联合圈内与其他机构共同改名了大声大片（最近公布了天秤座监管的启动区块，以方便阅读各个方面的项目统一使用天秤座）。尽管如此，天秤座最终压力落了个胎腹中，但该死的中心其实就职于 Libra 去开发者却继承了项目的一些开发成果（比如移动开发者以另一种方式去换取）是的全新 Layer1 项目。\n\n目前，已公开于零售设备设施的Layer1、Liera等设施，其中Aptos是从量级、发展、匹配程度来看可以说一半领先。\n\nAptos 于今年 2 月 2 日，彼时，曾任 Libra 的开发者和余名成立了 Aptos Lab，并宣布将根据 Libra 的一些现有技术重新开发网络，具体来说，Aptos仍将建立在库基础上，使用 Move 代码编程语言和 Move 的开发环境，并且将采用之后的 Diem-BFT 达成共识。不过，与付出代价的 Libra 不同，的愿景则将聚焦于提高第一层的安全性和可扩展性，打造可以为人们提供服装的基础设施网络。\n\n3 月 1 日投投，Aptos 曾举办过 2 美元的融资策略，2 美元的融资策略，Katie1 领着 Multicoin Capital、三箭资本、FTX Ventures 和 Coinbase Ventures 等机构举办；同月下旬，Apt再次完成该轮的具体信息投向未来实验室，但未来机构包括确定，并且合作伙伴可以与 Binance 合作，并可以与 Binance 建立开发、代码审查和黑客马拉松等方面的基础设施建设。\n\n目前，一款手机的第二个注册空投测试网的第二次空投测试网已经运行良好的运行测试和测试网测试完成了测试，并测试了500个代币的具体情况，每天的测试周期已用于测试周期测试。写过《我和Aptos测试的节点聊聊，发现还难熬的网络炒作》（https://www.odaily.news/post/5180351），其他的读者可以看看。\n\n普通用户，通过 Mar 等终端钱包，建议前往 Apto 市场的 AptoF 项目包括 Apto 的域名化交易所域名服务、Liquidswap、NFT 等。\n\n**隋：20亿美元的新晋独角兽**\n\n日前，由项目团队发起亿亿美元开发团队的Libra项目开发团队正在筹划的项目中，我的十亿美元实验室正在寻求投资20亿美元，以千亿美元将融资 2 亿亿美元承诺提供至少 1.4 美元的资金。Mysten Labs 正是 Sui 的开发团队。\n\n早在去年 11 月，Mysten Labs 就曾完成 3600 万美元 A 轮融资，该轮融资由 a16z 领投，Coinbase Ventures、NFX、Slow Ventures、Scribble Ventures、Samsung NEXT、Lux Capital 等参投。\n\n与 Apto 类似，Sui 语言必然继承了 Libra 的 Move 开发，但 Sui 却在原版本（Core Move）上做了改进（参见：https://sui.io/learn/sui-move-diffs） ，推出专门针对于网络的服务器，新的移动、性和移动版本的基础上对机制地址等进行了更好的交易，从而提高了网络性能的提高水平，提高了网络安全性能。 。\n\n提升性能，通过对交易类型进行分类，隋会针对具有一贯关系的交易的核心问题的核心机制，兑现交易的并行化处理（交易并行化、交易并行化），从而来从始终关系到隋会的核心交易机制网络提升性能。据 Figment Capital 合伙人 Trace 介绍\n\n（参见：https://twitter.com/tracecrypto1/status/1546498909513650177），在 MacBook Pro 上运行 Sui 节点的早期数据显示能力超过 12 万笔 Token 交易。\n\n5 月末，Mysten Lab 发布了 Sui 的经济币模型及激励相关内容，SUI 的总量为 100 枚，将在主网启动时流通，代币剩余的 UI 将在供应商未来为或在包括激励活动分配。用例参与方面，SUI 的用途 PoS 质押、支付费、支持 Sui 经济体系以及参与链上投票等。\n\n本周，为了测试目标的 Chrome 钱包，另外 Mysten Labs 已经发布了用于月宣ui 的官方发布了 Sui 官方发布的“Sui 8 朋友钱包测试网”\n\n**Linera：Libra Gang 背景的另一条 Layer1**\n\n继 Aptos、Sui 之后，Linera 是第三条已公开宣布完成融资的 Libra 背景 Layer1。\n\n6 日，Linera 宣布完成 600 美元轮融资，本轮融资的投投还是 a16z，包括 Cygni Capital、Kima Venture 和 Tribe Capital 等，所筹资金用于将众投机构和投资开发者募集资金等其他员工来共同制造协议。\n\n与另一种源项目相比，Linera 发表的一篇最新的预告片的首期报道，可用于发布的最新消息，可发布的最新消息.com/@linera/introducing-linera-bdb809735552）。\n\n简单来说，Linera 希望制造一个可以使用 web2 应用那样轻松扩展的低延迟区块链，像其 Linera 聚焦在了创始人兼首席执行官 Mathieu Baudet 时的重点研究 Libra 协议和 Zef 之时上通过这个协议，将整个运营商的运营商和运营商运营商之间的运营商快速运营。\n\nLinera 的愿景要推广这种方法，让它很实用，让大多数基础帐户的操作能够在几秒内快速得到确认。\n\n**歌唱：Cosmos 生态的稳定币新野望**\n\n尚比较测试阶段，但可以已经然吸引了市场的广泛关注。\n\n来看一看，Canto 是从一条基于 Cosmos SDK 上不同市场的其他 Layer1 网络，会胡椒粉与其他几个 Layer1 网络，Canto 自带一些 DeFi 组件，例如分叉于 Compound 的分叉功能于 Solidly 的 DEX、以及一个叫作注的全新稳定。\n\n从组合性上来看，这三个 DeFi 组件之间是相相成的关系。注意，市场发行并不直接走薄荷机制，需要通过制定超额生成正常的 ETH、ATOM、CANTO 等资产，辅助其有效锚定需要通过最高市场交易联盟的稳定市场规则，以及 DEX 的联合委员会来共同维护，注意将作为联盟上层（甚至整个 Cosmos 的服务于领导及市场）。\n\nUST暴雷，去市场上出现了一定程度的生态在生态上的表现，NOTE在一定程度上对生态环境进行了集中展示，NOTE一定是在整个市场的视线。如果 UST 也可以直接采用正常的方式复制，就可以像 Layer1 一样正常使用了一而快速打开欢迎。\n\n \n **齿轮：Polkadot 生态最受期待的智能合约链**\n\nCosmos生态有Canto，Polkadot生态也期待值非常高的Layer1 Gear。\n\n去年 12 月，基于 Polkadot 的智能合约投Gear 宣布完成 1200 万美元融资，本轮融资由 Blockchange 领投，Three Arrows Capital、Lemniscap、Distributed Global、Polkadot 创始人 Gavin Wood 等参参。\n\nGear 是支持 WebAssembly 的一条（SM）的合约，待成功拍下高级平行链插槽并接入后，开发者将能够在 5 分钟内以最简单、最有效的方式将其 Dapps 部署到 Gear，即进入波卡大生态内。\n\n就技术特点而言，从包括但不支持以下几种不同特性的开发者的语言，例如 Rust、C++ 等，将大大降低一系列、C++ 等不同类型的开发者的语言。入门窗帘，为行业带来的好处二是当应用程序在浏览器中运行时，WebAssembly 的程序运行速度快，以用户的实际体验；第三点关于智能合约的沟通，耳机使用采用演员模型，这种类型的设计上是可分片的，可并行的，开发者可以在模型上进行异步编程，演示模型的允许处理效果，真正意义上的各种不同业务，基于 Gear 的不同业务逻辑 Dapps 可以高速运行。\n\n**Celestia：让Celo甘愿降级作“绿叶”的Layer1**\n\nCelestia 的前世名叫做 LazyLedger，虽然这两个名字可能都不是很复杂，但你可能对这件事有过某种印象。\n\n一个是去年 Polygon 推出通用可扩展数据可用性层 Avail 时，Celestia 的联合创始人 Mustafa Al-Bassam 曾发声讨论 Avail 的介绍几乎逐字复制了他在 2019 年写的 Celestia 介绍。\n\n二是今年 4 月，Celo 财库组织 Ocelot 文表示，计划更改其公链发展路线图，将 Layer1 架构转换为在 Celestia 之外的 Layer2 Rollup，使用 Celestia 网络实现共享性和数据有效性的方法，而不再承担验证者和共识问题的责任。\n\nCelestia的第1层，该是链上的首个“特殊区块链”。交易层进行解耦，其本身作为共识层将只承担交易层的划分和数据验证工作，具体的执行则将至其他至连接层的交易执行网络（如Celo）除外。\n\n采用链构架，可实现链结构，并实现共识“层级共识”的多层次结构来实现多个链表链的扩展性、希望和互操作性”。\n\n路线图显示计划，Celestia 于 2022 年启动测试网，并在 2023 年逐步启动激励测试网以及主网，其开发团队也已确认会用于 PoS 质押的发布。\n\n然而，因此，Celestia 在架构上因此与 Polka 的“多条链+平行链”的存在一定相似，而原本构筑的链架构路径看起来好像是那么如人意，待 Celestia 上线时可以正常运行实际观察待观察。\n\n \n **Aleo：四年磨一剑的隐私龙头**\n\n真的很详细，Aleo 团队在 2019 年开始开发并没有什么新项目，在 2019 年左右完成了它的框架项目，2800 年左右完成了 2800 年 2021 年融资，a16z 领投，Placeholder VC、Galaxy Digital、Variant Fund、Coinbase Ventures、Ethereal Ventures、Polychain Capital、Slow Ventures、Dekrypt Capital、Scalar Capital、Zero Knowledge Validator、Coinbase 前首席技术官 Balaji Srinivasan 等参投。\n\n今年2月，Aleo又完成了2亿美元的B轮融资，SoftBank、Kora Management领投，a16z继续跟投、Tiger Global、Samsung Ventures等参投。\n\nAleo 的定位是合约的隐私类型 Layer1，其核心技术是 Zexe 和 Leo 核心板块，Zexe 同意两个协议在 ZeroCash 原有的 zks 技术上进行改进，也可以加密的令牌交易，可以应用生态平台的编程语言，Leo 作为 Aleo 的编程语言，可以将 Zexe 共识协议的 zk-s 设置讨论，任何在 Aleo 平台上支持的 Dapp 都可以使用 zk-s 交易。\n\n值得一提的是，Aleo 第一季度曾游区块链游戏平台 去年这一年有 9 亿美元（亿美元）合作，将携手 Aleo 的解决方案将零知识证明带入链中。\n\n测试测试完成后，Aleo 将在主网发布阶段，其代代也将同步进入，待Aleo 测试第三代测试网已披露其将采用减半式的代币模型。\n\n**Anoma：支持任意资产自由交换的隐私网络**\n\nAnoma 是力强风投 Polychain Capital 推的隐私型 PoS 公链。\n\n去年4月，Anoma完成了首轮675万美元融资，Polychain Capital领投，Electric Capital、Coinbase Ventures、FBG Capital、CMS

"加密世界已然浮现多起，伴随着这个行业的熊熊轮回，也伴随着混乱的生机。项目的“兴衰”持续进化、生长。\n\n上一天的大牛市中，再一次是我们到了Layer1、Berana、街头的大价值。城市的价值发展迅速，年轻人迅速发展成熟，各种高速增长的同时应用，在链上也发现了基础市场的价值。\n\n时过这些日子，历经数月的洗礼，第一层中的大多数项目都表现出第一层的情况，然而，在过去的一段时间里，却一直过往的环境中，仍然拥有相当强的白日牛市），结合“每一轮的轮回、项目都将诞生于上一轮高亮的城市”的历史，此时开发阶段我们更应该把时间投射到更早的时候尚早的全新Layer1们。\n\n业内人士看来，“熊市级，牛市级”的目前来看，综合一级市场动态来看，新一代Layer1即将成为新机构的聚焦点，Aptos、Sui等明星项目都即将完成完成数亿美元等级的融资。\n\n为了帮助大家清楚地捕捉到Layer1O赛场的最新发展趋势，每日星球从近半年内走入大众视野且尚未发币的新兴Layer1入选中榜10家较具代表性的项目，项目组等，我们真正的应用情况、亮点、最新进展未来手机对Layer1进行\n\n提前说明是，但只是某个组中需要出现的项目均基于融资情况、始创背景、市场热度等因素筛选而出，保证项目最终能够以较早的阶段完成项目，因此无法如期顺利完成发展，并成功打开市场，因此不组合投资建议。\n\n**Aptos： 最强势的新生代 Layer1**\n\n2019 年，Facebook 联合圈内与其他机构共同改名了大声大片（最近公布了天秤座监管的启动区块，以方便阅读各个方面的项目统一使用天秤座）。尽管如此，天秤座最终压力落了个胎腹中，但该死的中心其实就职于 Libra 去开发者却继承了项目的一些开发成果（比如移动开发者以另一种方式去换取）是的全新 Layer1 项目。\n\n目前，已公开于零售设备设施的Layer1、Liera等设施，其中Aptos是从量级、发展、匹配程度来看可以说一半领先。\n\nAptos 于今年 2 月 2 日，彼时，曾任 Libra 的开发者和余名成立了 Aptos Lab，并宣布将根据 Libra 的一些现有技术重新开发网络，具体来说，Aptos仍将建立在库基础上，使用 Move 代码编程语言和 Move 的开发环境，并且将采用之后的 Diem-BFT 达成共识。不过，与付出代价的 Libra 不同，的愿景则将聚焦于提高第一层的安全性和可扩展性，打造可以为人们提供服装的基础设施网络。\n\n3 月 1 日投投，Aptos 曾举办过 2 美元的融资策略，2 美元的融资策略，Katie1 领着 Multicoin Capital、三箭资本、FTX Ventures 和 Coinbase Ventures 等机构举办；同月下旬，Apt再次完成该轮的具体信息投向未来实验室，但未来机构包括确定，并且合作伙伴可以与 Binance 合作，并可以与 Binance 建立开发、代码审查和黑客马拉松等方面的基础设施建设。\n\n目前，一款手机的第二个注册空投测试网的第二次空投测试网已经运行良好的运行测试和测试网测试完成了测试，并测试了500个代币的具体情况，每天的测试周期已用于测试周期测试。写过《我和Aptos测试的节点聊聊，发现还难熬的网络炒作》https://www.odaily.news/post/5180351\n\n普通用户，通过 Mar 等终端钱包，建议前往 Apto 市场的 AptoF 项目包括 Apto 的域名化交易所域名服务、Liquidswap、NFT 等。\n\n**隋：20亿美元的新晋独角兽**\n\n日前，由项目团队发起亿亿美元开发团队的Libra项目开发团队正在筹划的项目中，我的十亿美元实验室正在寻求投资20亿美元，以千亿美元将融资 2 亿亿美元承诺提供至少 1.4 美元的资金。Mysten Labs 正是 Sui 的开发团队。\n\n早在去年 11 月，Mysten Labs 就曾完成 3600 万美元 A 轮融资，该轮融资由 a16z 领投，Coinbase Ventures、NFX、Slow Ventures、Scribble Ventures、Samsung NEXT、Lux Capital 等参投。\n\n与 Apto 类似，Sui 语言必然继承了 Libra 的 Move 开发，但 Sui 却在原版本（Core Move）上做了改进（参见：https://sui.io/learn/sui-move-diffs） ，推出专门针对于网络的服务器，新的移动、性和移动版本的基础上对机制地址等进行了更好的交易，从而提高了网络性能的提高水平，提高了网络安全性能。 。\n\n提升性能，通过对交易类型进行分类，隋会针对具有一贯关系的交易的核心问题的核心机制，兑现交易的并行化处理（交易并行化、交易并行化），从而来从始终关系到隋会的核心交易机制网络提升性能。据 Figment Capital 合伙人 Trace 介绍\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tracecrypto1/status/1546498909513650177\n\nMacBook Pro 上运行 Sui 节点的早期数据显示能力超过 12 万笔 Token 交易。\n\n5 月末，Mysten Lab 发布了 Sui 的经济币模型及激励相关内容，SUI 的总量为 100 枚，将在主网启动时流通，代币剩余的 UI 将在供应商未来为或在包括激励活动分配。用例参与方面，SUI 的用途 PoS 质押、支付费、支持 Sui 经济体系以及参与链上投票等。\n\n本周，为了测试目标的 Chrome 钱包，另外 Mysten Labs 已经发布了用于月宣ui 的官方发布了 Sui 官方发布的“Sui 8 朋友钱包测试网”\n\n**Linera：Libra Gang 背景的另一条 Layer1**\n\n继 Aptos、Sui 之后，Linera 是第三条已公开宣布完成融资的 Libra 背景 Layer1。\n\n6 日，Linera 宣布完成 600 美元轮融资，本轮融资的投投还是 a16z，包括 Cygni Capital、Kima Venture 和 Tribe Capital 等，所筹资金用于将众投机构和投资开发者募集资金等其他员工来共同制造协议。\n\n与另一种源项目相比，Linera 发表的一篇最新的预告片的首期报道，可用于发布的最新消息，可发布的最新消息.com/@linera/introducing-linera-bdb809735552）。\n\n简单来说，Linera 希望制造一个可以使用 web2 应用那样轻松扩展的低延迟区块链，像其 Linera 聚焦在了创始人兼首席执行官 Mathieu Baudet 时的重点研究 Libra 协议和 Zef 之时上通过这个协议，将整个运营商的运营商和运营商运营商之间的运营商快速运营。\n\nLinera 的愿景要推广这种方法，让它很实用，让大多数基础帐户的操作能够在几秒内快速得到确认。\n\n**歌唱：Cosmos 生态的稳定币新野望**\n\n尚比较测试阶段，但可以已经然吸引了市场的广泛关注。\n\n来看一看，Canto 是从一条基于 Cosmos SDK 上不同市场的其他 Layer1 网络，会胡椒粉与其他几个 Layer1 网络，Canto 自带一些 DeFi 组件，例如分叉于 Compound 的分叉功能于 Solidly 的 DEX、以及一个叫作注的全新稳定。\n\n从组合性上来看，这三个 DeFi 组件之间是相相成的关系。注意，市场发行并不直接走薄荷机制，需要通过制定超额生成正常的 ETH、ATOM、CANTO 等资产，辅助其有效锚定需要通过最高市场交易联盟的稳定市场规则，以及 DEX 的联合委员会来共同维护，注意将作为联盟上层（甚至整个 Cosmos 的服务于领导及市场）。\n\nUST暴雷，去市场上出现了一定程度的生态在生态上的表现，NOTE在一定程度上对生态环境进行了集中展示，NOTE一定是在整个市场的视线。如果 UST 也可以直接采用正常的方式复制，就可以像 Layer1 一样正常使用了一而快速打开欢迎。\n\n**齿轮：Polkadot 生态最受期待的智能合约链**\n\nCosmos生态有Canto，Polkadot生态也期待值非常高的Layer1 Gear。\n\n去年 12 月，基于 Polkadot 的智能合约投Gear 宣布完成 1200 万美元融资，本轮融资由 Blockchange 领投，Three Arrows Capital、Lemniscap、Distributed Global、Polkadot 创始人 Gavin Wood 等参参。\n\nGear 是支持 WebAssembly 的一条（SM）的合约，待成功拍下高级平行链插槽并接入后，开发者将能够在 5 分钟内以最简单、最有效的方式将其 Dapps 部署到 Gear，即进入波卡大生态内。\n\n就技术特点而言，从包括但不支持以下几种不同特性的开发者的语言，例如 Rust、C++ 等，将大大降低一系列、C++ 等不同类型的开发者的语言。入门窗帘，为行业带来的好处二是当应用程序在浏览器中运行时，WebAssembly 的程序运行速度快，以用户的实际体验；第三点关于智能合约的沟通，耳机使用采用演员模型，这种类型的设计上是可分片的，可并行的，开发者可以在模型上进行异步编程，演示模型的允许处理效果，真正意义上的各种不同业务，基于 Gear 的不同业务逻辑 Dapps 可以高速运行。\n\n**Celestia：让Celo甘愿降级作“绿叶”的Layer1**\n\nCelestia 的前世名叫做 LazyLedger，虽然这两个名字可能都不是很复杂，但你可能对这件事有过某种印象。\n\n一个是去年 Polygon 推出通用可扩展数据可用性层 Avail 时，Celestia 的联合创始人 Mustafa Al-Bassam 曾发声讨论 Avail 的介绍几乎逐字复制了他在 2019 年写的 Celestia 介绍。\n\n二是今年 4 月，Celo 财库组织 Ocelot 文表示，计划更改其公链发展路线图，将 Layer1 架构转换为在 Celestia 之外的 Layer2 Rollup，使用 Celestia 网络实现共享性和数据有效性的方法，而不再承担验证者和共识问题的责任。\n\nCelestia的第1层，该是链上的首个“特殊区块链”。交易层进行解耦，其本身作为共识层将只承担交易层的划分和数据验证工作，具体的执行则将至其他至连接层的交易执行网络（如Celo）除外。\n\n采用链构架，可实现链结构，并实现共识“层级共识”的多层次结构来实现多个链表链的扩展性、希望和互操作性”。\n\n路线图显示计划，Celestia 于 2022 年启动测试网，并在 2023 年逐步启动激励测试网以及主网，其开发团队也已确认会用于 PoS 质押的发布。\n\n然而，因此，Celestia 在架构上因此与 Polka 的“多条链+平行链”的存在一定相似，而原本构筑的链架构路径看起来好像是那么如人意，待 Celestia 上线时可以正常运行实际观察待观察。\n\n**Aleo：四年磨一剑的隐私龙头**\n\n真的很详细，Aleo 团队在 2019 年开始开发并没有什么新项目，在 2019 年左右完成了它的框架项目，2800 年左右完成了 2800 年 2021 年融资，a16z 领投，Placeholder VC、Galaxy Digital、Variant Fund、Coinbase Ventures、Ethereal Ventures、Polychain Capital、Slow Ventures、Dekrypt Capital、Scalar Capital、Zero Knowledge Validator、Coinbase 前首席技术官 Balaji Srinivasan 等参投。\n\n今年2月，Aleo又完成了2亿美元的B轮融资，SoftBank、Kora Management领投，a16z继续跟投、Tiger Global、Samsung Ventures等参投。\n\nAleo 的定位是合约的隐私类型 Layer1，其核心技术是 Zexe 和 Leo 核心板块，Zexe 同意两个协议在 ZeroCash 原有的 zks 技术上进行改进，也可以加密的令牌交易，可以应用生态平台的编程语言，Leo 作为 Aleo 的编程语言，可以将 Zexe 共识协议的 zk-s 设置讨论，任何在 Aleo 平台上支持的 Dapp 都可以使用 zk-s 交易。\n\n值得一提的是，Aleo 第一季度曾游区块链游戏平台 去年这一年有 9 亿美元（亿美元）合作，将携手 Aleo 的解决方案将零知识证明带入链中。\n\n测试测试完成后，Aleo 将在主网发布阶段，其代代也将同步进入，待Aleo 测试第三代测试网已披露其将采用减半式的代币模型。\n\n**Anoma：支持任意资产自由交换的隐私网络**\n\nAnoma 是力强风投 Polychain Capital 推的隐私型 PoS 公链。\n\n去年4月，Anoma完成了首轮675万美元融资，Polychain Capital领投，Electric Capital、Coinbase Ventures、FBG Capital、CMS Holdings、Lemniscap、Cygni Labs、Walden Bridge Capital等参投。\n\n同年11月，Anoma再次融资2600万美元，Polychain Capital 继续领投，参投机构Fifth Era、Maven Capital、Zola Capital、Electric Capital、CMCC等。\n\nAnoma 将真正打交道的核心分别是希望物的“隐私权”，该项目还以“为系统提供服务”，并以金融界人士的名义将其交予个人隐私。\n\n“物物”，希望个人在交易中允许任何一种可指代使用的资产交换或支付工具的网络交易，任意选择资产的类别。值得一提这里的任意资产的类别。是可以任意兑换的商品、服务或任何可表示在其价值链上的任何数字、价值的东西，包括通过操作性转移到 Anoma 上的资产、以及稳定币形式的数字货币等。\n\n“隐私”则更好地理解，在 Anoma 中，并为保护隐私保护方保护用户数据，并防止隐私保护方、金额和面额知识加密，并且会利用来保证资金的转移结果。 ，Anoma 的另外一个网络资产在转移时会有一个资产池，每个资产持有一个单独的资产。这样的资产，所有参与者越过，有多个参与者，就在一个巨大的组织之间，产生巨大的影响增加了资产转移数据的隐蔽程度。\n\n**Iron Fish：隐私层成为 Web3 世界的隐私**\n\n「我在这个民族学美国在经典场景基础上，基于原语言出出的一套加密系统，这个希望项目的住所来作为通讯通讯的主题。\n\n去年 11 月，铁鱼轮宣布完成 2770 万美元 A 融资，本轮融资由 a16z 领投，Elad Gil、红杉资本（Sequoia）、Electric Capital、Dylan Field、Alan Howard、Jeff Weiner（领英执行董事长） 、MetaStable、A Capital、Divesh Makan（Iconiq）、Do Kwon（Terra）、Matt Luongo（Keep

为每个链上地址额外配备一个“感谢”（查看密钥），地址持有者可以通过该钥匙其他神圣人权限。\n\n监管机制的解决问题，通过“回应地”，Layer1 Iron Fish 机构在显示状态下将相关的信息显示在下类查看相应地址的详细信息，从而允许维护有必要的隐私保护义务（AML） 。\n\n目前，Iron Fish将继续进行第二轮激励测试网阶段，轮激励测试将持续持续，直到阶段稳定、功能完善，做好全部准备工作。\n\n将通与其他网络桥未来多层链之间的跨链互联，赋予不同的区块链实现目标，提供保护性，其最终愿景是世界的覆盖。\n\n**Monad：Jump 前任理想“热”的扩张容**\n\n4月半时被死（当时Jump一个TerraTrading研究负责人Hon E折），Jeump

NPC、一个可穿戴画廊、直播屏幕和一个射击游戏。请参阅以下活动的亮点：\n\n[https://twitter.com/polygonalmind/status/1550177033069756417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1550177033069756417%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecentraland.org%2Fblog%2Fannouncement%2Fbehind-the-scenes-with-polygonal-mind-creating-successful-experiences-in-decentraland%2F](https://twitter.com/polygonalmind/status/1550177033069756417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1550177033069756417%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecentraland.org%2Fblog%2Fannouncement%2Fbehind-the-scenes-with-polygonal-mind-creating-successful-experiences-in-decentraland%2F)\n\n随着元宇宙与主流越来越多的交集，每天都会发现新的用例、品牌和社区开始意识到 Web3 带来的潜力。像 Decentraland 这样的平台为社区发展、外展、参与和推广提供了新的、令人耳目一新的机会。但是，由于元宇宙对许多人来说仍然非常新颖且陌生，因此感兴趣的各方可能不知道该从哪里开始。这就是像 Polygonal Mind 这样的开发工作室能提供服务的地方。\n\n除了为品牌和社区创造新的机会之外，元宇宙还开辟了一个全新的职业路线，以提供使这些机会成为现实的熟练劳动力，并就什么在元宇宙中最适合提供内部人士的建议。原本为程序员和 Web3 爱好者的个人已经成为元宇宙建设者、体验开发者、可穿戴设计师、活动策划者、LAND 所有者等等。作为一家成功的工作室，Polygonal Mind 是元宇宙早期的资深人士，而现在已为好一些大品牌开发了许多绝佳体验。\n\n该工作室很乐意回答来自 Decentraland 基金会的一些问题，并与社区分享他们的故事，以及他们的行业观点和建议。一起来了解 Polygonal Mind 的元宇宙体验构建行业的幕后花絮。\n\n### Polygonal Mind 问答\n\n**DCL：当 MTN DEW x NYXL 这个项目找你时，他们是否已经知道他们想要设计和建造什么，或者你是否帮助他们构思了这种体验？如果是，你是如何想出为他们设计的体验的？**\n\n**PM：**这个项目是通过 Mountain Dew 的合作伙伴 NYXL 找到我们的，他们带着明确的愿景和目标来到我们这里，但在视觉方面完全开放。正如我们通常所做的那样，我们开始为他们创建完全不同的概念和草图，直到我们得到一个我们都认为拥有最好的用户体验但也非常适合 Mountain Dew 的品牌战略的概念。\n\nNYXL 一直是一个很好的合作伙伴，让我们能够为他们的空间提供独特而富有创意的一切。我们一起探讨了对 MtnDew 品牌和 NYSubliners 团队等中心主题的不同看法和观点。\n\n**DCL：他们什么时候联系你关于要在 Decentraland 中创建激活的事情？品牌应该提前多长时间寻找创作者？**\n\n**PM：**他们在 5 月中旬联系了我们。我们认为最好在活动安排前 3 个月联系设计/开发工作室。这将有足够的时间来准备整个战略，以确保我们能够完全符合合作伙伴的利益和期望。\n\n**DCL：最近有很多大品牌与你联系，以在虚拟世界中创建激活和体验吗？你觉得元宇宙中激活的潜力是否已经被主流完全实现了？要实现它需要什么？**\n\n**PM：**是的，多个月以来许多大品牌已经与我们进行联系，过去几个月我们的影响力有所增加。我们认为元宇宙中激活的潜力尚未完全实现，但我们确实看到了关注度和出席率的提高。我们致力于大规模采用。我们认为去中心化的元宇宙将继续存在，并且它们将在不久的将来成为常态。但底层技术有待改进；更好的加载时间、更多的集成、更动态的世界、互操作性、更多支持元宇宙的设备、更多的社交联系、增加虚拟身份感觉的改进等。除了技术之外，区块链、元宇宙和 NFT 的主要愿景需要正常化，这是我们认为只有时间才能解决的问题。\n\n**DCL：您认为使用此类活动和体验来推广品牌或社区的潜力和好处是什么？您认为它与传统的促销方式相比如何？**\n\n**PM：**元宇宙开辟了品牌及其社区之间参与的新方式。它比其他传统的广告方式更具沉浸感、吸引力和乐趣。如果我们将其与区块链相结合，我们将获得更多新的方式来与我们的观众互动而达到一个新的水平，他们不再被视为个人客户，而是作为一个整体社区，人们可以通过多种方式参与，例如投票或拥有品牌的数字产品可以为他们带来一些其它方式无法获得的好处和额外奖励。\n\n**DCL：你在 Decentraland 为品牌设计和创造什么样的体验？**\n\n**PM：**嗯，像这样的项目有很多阶段。根据客户及其对Web3/元宇宙的了解，项目在预生产阶段可能比实际生产阶段花费更多的时间。我们通常从一些咨询会议开始，在那里我们分享我们关于 Web3 和元宇宙激活的知识和专业知识，然后我们进入预生产阶段，我们为项目建立愿景和目标，确保我们与我们的合作伙伴完全一致，不仅在艺术上，而且从营销/商业的角度来看也是如此。最后我们进入生产阶段，我们不断分享我们的工作进展并在发布前讨论营销策略。\n\n**DCL：是什么让 Decentraland 的体验/激活“很棒”？成功的关键要素是什么？**\n\n**PM：**这种体验必须很有趣，并且与您在真实生活的活动中所习惯的不同。玩游戏、获得酷炫的可穿戴设备以及与其他玩家一起发现令人愉快的品牌时刻，这些都会让人们更快乐，并与品牌的价值观建立更紧密的联系。\n\n**DCL：对于希望在 Decentraland 推广和创造体验的品牌和社区，您有什么建议？**\n\n**PM：**不要专注于销售，而是要创造价值和社区。\n\n**DCL：Decentraland 在活动和激活方面为品牌和社区提供了哪些可能性？**\n\n**PM：**如今，Decentraland 是最开放和最发达的元宇宙平台之一，它可以让任何人创造几乎任何你能想象到的东西。由于它通过区块链本身去中心化，它允许我们实施几个新工具来增强用户体验。其中一些是直播、NFT、可穿戴设备和游戏开发等。\n\n**DCL：对于希望成为 Decentraland 体验设计师和创建者的其他人，你有什么建议？你需要什么样的技能？你的团队需要什么样的人？**\n\n**PM：**我们的第一条建议是在做任何事情之前先花时间在 Decentraland。从其他人正在做什么，他们如何以及为什么这样做以及人们在平台上的本地行为中学习。我们已经看到许多新设计师将大量时间投入到完全脱节的事物上，而社区可以很快看到这一点。至于技能组合，这更难回答。在这一点上，我们的工作室个人需要广泛的技能，因为我们的经验变得非常详细。我们需要 3D 艺术家、游戏开发人员、区块链开发人员、动画师、Web 开发人员等等……但如果你才刚开始，一个有程序员和艺术家的团队就足以在 Decentraland 中制作很酷的东西。\n\n**DCL：你认为这些类型的激活和促销是未来吗？你认为它们将如何随着时间的推移而变化和发展？**\n\n**PM：**是的！与常规广告相比，这些举措对用户而言更具互动性，它们还可以为你提供有关谁对你的品牌感兴趣以及感兴趣程度的直接信息！这样的事情很难预见，就在一年前，我们为 MTN DEW 制作的事件是完全无法概念化的。 Decentraland 几乎每天都在技术层面上发展，同时也在社区层面上发展。新来者带着新想法进入平台，使整个平台旋转以适应他们。实时看到变化是非常令人兴奋的。我们期望的是更丰富的体验，质量胜于数量。\n\n**DCL：Polygonal Mind 的故事是什么？你是怎么走到今天的？你最初是否打算在元宇宙中创造体验？你对你的未来有什么看法？**\n\n**PM：**Polygonal Mind 在八年前作为一个独立的游戏开发工作室开始。我们转型为一家外包工作室，为移动和 VR 行业的游戏开发者提供艺术。我们开发了许多低多边形游戏，如 Morphite，获得了 Apple Store 的艺术奖项，并参与了 Beat Saber 等大型 VR 游戏。\n\n然后，在 2018 年底，就在第二次 LAND 销售之前，我们发现了 Decentraland。我们开始涉足社区，当时社区里大多都是爱好者和程序员，所以我们认为这对我们来说是完美的匹配。作为一家独立的创意工作室，我们觉得我们有机会利用我们的艺术知识帮助建立 Decentraland 的未来。一段时间后，Momus 集体找到了我们，并聘请我们建造了 Momus 公园，这是 Decentraland 有史以来第一个加密艺术画廊，至今仍然是最大的。这在当时是一个巨大的技术挑战，我们需要多次来回才能实现它，因为我们必须与数百个 LAND 合作，这在当时几乎是不可能的。\n\n从那时起，我们一直在 Decentraland 中建造东西，并且我们慢慢地将注意力从游戏行业转移到了元宇宙。到 2020 年底，我们 80% 的收入仅来自 Decentraland 项目。从那时起，我们建立了艺术画廊、游戏、总部、活动区、可穿戴设备以及许多其它疯狂的体验，比如 MegaCube。这是额外的背景信息，至今我们构建了近 4000 个 LAND 的场景，并将我们的工作室从 4 人发展到 50 名团队成员，同时保持独立！\n\n对我们来说，未来充满希望，我们希望继续在 Decentraland 中尽可能多地创造，通过艺术作为让人们进入其中的入口。\n\n**选择您常用的频道加入与我们联系，关注Decentraland(MANA)的最新动态**\n\n**DCL基金会全球社区： \n 【[Official Website](https://decentraland.org)**】 \n 【**[Telegram](https://t.me/decentralandTG)**】 \n

《[网络空间独立宣言](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence)》 的前一年，另一部影响早期互联网政治意识形态的著作出现了：大卫·朗菲尔德（David Ronfeldt） 的 《[部落、制度、市场、网络](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)》（TIMN）。TIMN 报告由兰德（RAND）公司资助。在 “奇爱博士 (Dr. Strangelove) ” 中，兰德公司被黑化模仿为 BLAND 公司。兰德公司成立于 1948 年，是一家非营利性的研究开发智库，负责向美国军方、政府和工业界提供政策信息。因为互联网始于这个军事化的环境，我们也将从这里开始。\n\nTIMN报告创造了一个社会进化的叙事，其中人类通过四种不同的组织形式取得了进步：\n\n![（T）部落有亲属、氏族和血统的社会组织原则。(I) 机构具有等级制的社会组织原则。（M）市场具有竞争交换的社会组织原则。(N)网络具有分层协作交换的社会组织原则。这里的分层指的是无等级、无层次，或能够以多种方式进行等级划分的组织。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fccfc3b17-2054-4305-b705-bd23ec2e5598.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n当新的组织形式随时间演变时，之前的组织形式“在其活动范围内增长，即使该范围已全新定义”，其指出了市场如何增加税收支持制度国家，尽管限制了其对直接经济交换的参与。\n\n![Sam Hart, Laura Lotti, Toby Shorin, Squad Wealth, 2020](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F80498627-0fad-4e56-9afe-848f8f50a539.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n这份报告的制度偏见很明显，比如，它将进步等同于西方的自由民主，而且它对社会进化的叙述可能充其量是简化的。不过，它的论点为去中心化组织有意或无意地，从中汲取政治意识形态提供了历史背景。这在报告中对网络这一最新组织形式的识别上最为明显。\n\n这份报告对网络的定义有点开放式。网络和之前组织形式之间的一个关键区别特征是，网络被描述为**多组织**，强调距离更远的”小的、分散的、自治的” 群体间的协作。这些团体不一定共享一个独特的组织统一体。虽然网络在历史上一直存在，但新的信息技术强调合作关系，通过跨越司法管辖区对机构产生巨大影响，“促进了[企业集团](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu)和其他分布式、网络化的全球企业的增长，以及越来越多的所谓的‘虚拟公司’”，大卫·朗菲尔德表示。然而，多组织网络的主要领域既不是公共部门，也不是私营部门，至少两者仍然是传统的形态。相反，它们将改变第三个领域，即报告中称为公民社会的“自治社会部门”。按照 1995 年的规划，公民社会将包括非政府组织（NGO）、草根组织和私人志愿组织；公民社会通过多组织网络得以加强，并可能解决不平等、官僚主义和普及性等之前组织无法解决的问题。\n\n该报告呈现了一个甜美的网络政治形象：“虽然制度和市场组织形式的发展导致了对竞争优势的强调，多组织网络形式的发展可能会将重点转移到合作优势上”。这种政治表象的背后是非政府组织将在未来十年向全球输出的帝国软实力。对于那些目前在 Web3 工作的人来说，所有这些语言可能感觉很熟悉，尽管这种可疑的意识形态延续通常不会被注意到。通过揭示意识形态的衍变，我们有更大的机会去改变其路线。\n\n报告最后强调了公民社会的三个字母缩写词，即 NGO、NPO 和 PVO，当然，不包含这个在此以后出现的词：DAO。\n\n## 一个嵌合术语\n\nDAO 源于对去中心化技术特性如何改变组织运作方式的想象，去中心化技术特性包括全球数字资产、抗审查和自动化操作。最初被称为[去中心化自治公司](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i-1379644274)（DAC），更通用的术语 DAO出现于以太坊区块链社区。基于维塔利克·布特林（Vitalik Buterin）的“[DAO、DAC、DA 及其他：2014年以来不完整术语指南](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)”，DAO 可以被描述为一个资本化组织，由软件协议来指导其操作，将自动化置于其中心，而人在其边缘。例如，软件协议可以指定组织自动向其成员分配资金的条件。这导致了这样一种想法，即组织价值可以通过代码自动执行，这一影响深远的想法，可能错误地[暗示隐性知识](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)可以在软件协议中充分表达。虽然这个术语有很多假设的想法，但当 DAO 从理论变成实验时，社区很大程度上重新定义了 DAO 这个术语，以表示“不可阻挡的”或抗审查的企业。第一个 DAO，称为 [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization))，已经成为以太坊区块链社区迄今为止最大的事件之一，2016 年它在以太坊筹集了相当于超过1.5亿美元的ETH资金。然而，这个实验被证明是短暂的，因为 The DAO 在推出一个月后被黑客攻击。\n\n与 DAO 相关的更大项目在几年内不会再次获得吸引力。从那时到现在，DAO 偏离了它最初的宗旨，不再继续作为一个嵌合术语，术语及其具体应用都根据其文化背景而变化。市场上的每一次投机活动，尽管充满噪音，但都为 DAO 可以发展的方向提供了新的信号，为实践中的概念带来了描述性、技术性和文化性上的改进。虽然有些人讽刺说，一个分享午餐账单的群体可能是一个 DAO，但为了避免其过度泛化，对 DAO 的关注将仅限于以太坊区块链社区中的例子，尽管在其他[类似协同机制的社区](https://twitter.com/helveticade/status/1400946733249662978)也起到重要作用。2021 年，DAO*可*被描述为符合数字合作主义运行原则的自发组织。作为自发组织，它们是陌生人、朋友或看上去不太可能的盟友以匿名的方式聚集一起，实现共同目标的一种跨司法管辖区的方式，并由代币模型、激励措施和治理提供支持。DAO 的成员可以通过代币拥有其数字资产的代表性所有权，代币通常同时充当治理权和网络效用。\n\n尽管许多 DAO 不会接受数字合作社的标签，但可以说 DAO 将合作主义作为一种*协议*，这意味着一组不断发展的关系实践，这与传统公司结构或去中心化自治公司不同，因为 DAO 优先考虑成员所有权。合作社的标签可以通过数字化来限定，因为今天 DAO 主要是围绕数字资产进行协调。然而，随着DAO概念在实践中发展，其将[不再完全依赖数字领域](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3)。我们将看到， DAO 还引入了新的维度，这些维度超出了数字合作社在概念上所涵盖的范围。\n\n[https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396184123761303554%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgnosisguild.mirror.xyz%2Ft4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q](https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396184123761303554%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgnosisguild.mirror.xyz%2Ft4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)\n\n*//Twitter 文：\n//DAO 不是产品，它们是关于产品或项目的决策框架。\n//如果你的 DAO 成功了，你甚至不应该知道它的存在，它只是一个运营良好的社区。*\n\n去中心化技术生态系统倾向于通过其技术产品来描述一种现象。然而，正如 Furtherfield 和 DECAL 分布式艺术实验室的联合创始人露丝·卡特洛（Ruth Catlow）所指出的那样，“我们需要先构建文化，在构建结构”。虽然以下对 DAO 工具的概述在实践中提供了概念的具体描述，但重要的是要记住，DAO 最终是通过集体网络来协作的。\n\n![DAO 的新手包, 2021](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fb277c810-3d61-4766-979c-af9d8b063e7e.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在其最简单的形式中，DAO 工具被描述为群聊和银行账户。2021年，这通常以 Discord 服务器和 [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/) 的形式出现，后者是一个创建[多签帐户](https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e)的 Web3 平台。多签账户允许多个司法管辖区的匿名团体在几分钟内汇集和管理资金，这种能力远远超过[传统的联合银行账户](https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1399196774967898113)。这种“最小可行” DAO 工具在2021年上半年表现良好，其中包括 PleasrDAO 等项目。\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/pleasrdao?lang=de) 通过集体竞拍艺术家 [pplpleasr](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr) 的 NFT。鉴于数字艺术品拍卖价格的不断上涨，PleasrDAO 背后的想法很简单：一群粉丝集体使用多签帐户，可以汇集资金进行竞拍，并通过共同持有，与其他主要竞标者竞争并赢得拍卖。在赢得他们的第一个同名拍卖会后， PleasrDAO 继续收集其他作品，如爱德华·斯诺登（Edward Snowden）的支持独立媒体的慈善拍卖 NFT 作品“[Stay Free](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437)”，当时共计 220,0 ETH 或价值 540 万美元。他们多次成功的经历意味着，在作为收集者的同时，PleasrDAO 将[扩大他们的范围](https://decrypt.co/66933/why-this-dao-bought-snowden-nft)，开始孵化他们的社区项目。像PleasrDAO这样的活动最有希望通过扩大成员来挑战机构收藏家，邀请PleasrDAO收藏的作品的艺术家，比如plplpleasr，反过来成为这个团体的成员。然而，要做到这一点，至关重要的是，所有权仍然是集体的，而不是机构化的。\n\n![由 PleasrDAO 拥有的 Gnosis 安全多签名帐户，他们共同持有收藏的 NFT。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fc9904c31-747e-4b83-aee1-0a2208b1f338.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n尽管群聊和多签帐户可能足以启动 DAO 的任务，但代币往往成为拥抱数字合作社原则的下一步骤。例如，PleasrDAO 发行了 $PEEPS，这是一个内部分发的代币，代表成员在收藏品中的权益，他们正在考虑将其上市，以拆分其收藏品的所有权。类似的实验，如 [PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=de) 启用了一种代币，其中 $PARTY 代币表示群聊的成员资格、治理权限和由 DAO 管理的生产价值的共同所有权。值得注意的是，PleasrDAO 和 PartyDAO 不是扁平层级结构，因为它们都选择了一组个人来管理它们的多签帐户金库。虽然 PleasrDAO 和 PartyDAO 最初专注于短期任务，但他们都在朝着长期愿景发展，即作为收藏家、投资者和孵化器，使用代币来代表体现数字合作精神的共同所有权。代币化为未来的网络创造了机遇和挑战。\n\n### 合作社运动的新维度\n\n回到它们的起源，今天的 DAO 与 The DAO 的相似之处，主要在于它们强调开放参与和经济价值创造，而它们的文化则更多地转向了特定的利基和社会联系。在上面的例子中，有一个术语有意含糊不清：治理。今天，许多 DAO 使用轻量级的 Snapshot 平台进行治理。在 [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) 上，每个 DAO 都有一个空间来创建项目并对项目进行投票。例如，[PleasrDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/pleasrdao.eth) 和   [PartyDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/partydao.eth) 都有一个 Snapshot 空间，在这个空间上他们对集体决策进行公开投票。 Snapsho 根据一个地址持有的 DAO 特有代币的数量对投票实施权重，如 PleasrDAO 中的 $PEEPS 代币。\n\n![PleasrDAO 的 Snapshot 空间显示了关于是否买入 Dreaming at Dusk NFT 以使 Tor 项目受益的投票。 投票以396,690 $PEEPS 代币的赞成票达成通过。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Ff09da5e4-c7e9-4dd4-b736-f6a504f02606.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在加密生态系统中，[治理的话题](https://technosphere-magazine.hkw.de/p/The-Byzantine-Generalization-Problem-Subtle-Strategy-in-the-Context-of-Blockchain-Governance-8UNNcM8VShTpBGWRuob1GP)有其自身的历史，这里不进行全面阐述。特别是 [MolochDAO](https://www.molochdao.com/) 项目，它使用经典字体 Papyrus 并大量参考游戏公会，在 The DAO 被黑客攻击后重新点燃去中心化治理的火焰。MolochDAO 激发了一大批新的

[DAOstack](https://daostack.io/) 还在继续为 DAO 开发平台，[Block Science](https://block.science/) 和 [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/) 等模块化项目不断出现。这些项目提供了支持多种[治理机制](https://blog.gnosis.pm/a-brief-discussion-of-the-protocol-governing-the-dxdao-7331407a2555)的 DAO 工具。然而，如果不涵盖其较少提及的同平台合作主义的关系，DAO 的史前史也是不完整的。\n\n基于数十年的共同倡议，Trebor Scholz 创造的“平台合作主义”一词以及 Nathan Schneider 概述的 “[交予社区治理](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73)（Exit to community）” 概念，通过 Jesse Walden 的 “[所有权经济](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/)” 等文章与加密领域产生了交集。这些口号提倡由用户社区拥有、开发和管理的平台。具体来说，“交予社区治理“的概念通过明确阐述公司发展所有权的第三条途径影响了去中心化治理。\n\n![Nathan Schneider，创业公司需要一个新的选择：退出社区，2019](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fd14efc42-4c3c-4e7b-a6c9-b760a118e7c5.jpeg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n“交予社区治理”这一概念在实践中，通过一些项目不断发展，比如 [DXdao](https://twitter.com/dxdao_?lang=de)，该项目启动的目的是赋予社区所有权、治理和软件协议的价值。今天，有许多去中心化的金融软件协议通过 DAO 指导其开发，很明显，软件协议既可以退出社区，也可以[与社区一起构建](https://twitter.com/VENTURE_DAO/status/1395544596550062080)。由于 DAO 使用早期阶段的软件工具，因此它们的第一个用户和用例将涉及数字资产（如软件协议）的治理，这是有意义的。 DAO 在数字领域的主导地位或许是它们与早期合作社运动相似之处常常被忽视的一个原因。\n\n今天，国际合作社联盟（ICA）将合作社定义为“个人自愿联合的自治团体，通过共同拥有和民主控制的企业来满足共同的经济、社会和文化需求和愿望”。合作社也可以由其法律实体的结构来界定，这种结构规定合作社是由其成员而不是股东所有的公司。1844年，一个纺织协会制定了《[罗奇代尔原则](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles)》（Rochdale Principles），标志着合作社历史上的一个关键时刻。国际合作社联盟采纳了这些运作原则，这些原则仍然指导着全球的合作社：\n\n1. 自愿及开放的会员资格\n2. 成员民主控制\n3. 成员经济参与\n4. 自治和独立\n5. 教育、培训和信息\n6. 合作社之间的合作\n7. 关心社区\n\n虽然这些操作原则在过去的两个世纪中不断发展，但今天的一些 DAO 可以很容易地制定这些运行原则。自愿和开放会员资格、成员经济参与和关注社区的原则可以转化为上述 DAO 的例子。自治、独立和合作社之间的合作原则是 DAO 作为多组织网络蓬勃发展的关键，通过跨 DAO 协作加强自治社会部门的建设。\n\nDAO 可以围绕成员民主控制设定更深思熟虑的规范，合作社通常将其定义为一个成员一票。大多数 DAO 使用代币投票，即一个代币一票。DAO 的理由是代币所有权代表利益相关者，代币模型通常在经济上直接与 DAO 联系在一起，例如通过对它所拥有的软件协议收费。这使得拥有更大经济利益的 DAO 成员相应地具有更大的影响力。代币投票并不直接违背合作社原则，因为有些合作社会根据质量（如产量）来权重投票。某些情况下，这可能感觉合适，但随着一些 DAO 朝着维护基本基础设施的方向发展，这种不平等显然变得不可取。在某种程度上，这是因为并非所有的利益相关者都具有代表其利益的购买力，他们的实践知识可能被排除在治理之外。这应该通过将文化渗透更多的决策机制来解决，这种[决策机制将经济利益与治理权利脱钩](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html)。\n\n在此之前，诸如 Tornado Cash 隐私协议等项目，已经通过向之前的用户追溯分发代币来解决这个分配问题，从而使用户成为协议的利益相关者。[Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) 项目是一个生态系统服务的公共区块链项目，该项目采取了另一种方法来解决这个分配问题。他们将30%的代币预留给土地管理员、气候科学家以及再生土地管理的其他利益相关者，形成了参与网络治理的[社区 DAO](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3)。由于代币可以比传统的公司权益、成员资格或股份更容易分发，这为一种新的代币持有者公司形式创造了可能性，它可以在治理中纳入更深入的实践知识，而不增加运营交易成本。具有实践知识或[“隐性”知识](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)的利益相关者，就像 Regen Network 案例中的土地管理员一样，通过在决策中融入非正式实践，使治理受益。在这里， DAO 开始引入新的维度，这些维度超出了数字合作社概念上所涵盖的操作原则。出于这个原因，应该像重视决策机制一样，将更多的创新和重点放在识别更广泛的利益相关者参与的代币分发机制上。\n\n在线社区的代币化可能是一个长期争论的主题。代币化并不是解决 web 2.0 社交媒介困境的最佳答案，而是引入了更多的金融化关系意识。作为一颗指路星，web3 应用程序的目标是在关系中引入价值（这在历史上曾被否认），例如劳动和环境的关系而非创建新的财务关系。这种情况下，对于以创造经济价值为使命的 DAO ，代币在三个方面成为一种有用的机制：\n\n1. 启动融资\n2. 分配治理权\n3. 协调 DAO 的生态系统\n\n代币化向早期组织引入了强大的*文化*规范：从一开始就期望对其资产实行透明的共同所有权。支付分红的传统公司结构和 DAO 之间的紧张关系持续存在。因为大多数 DAO 通过一种代币来代表治理权利，在某种意义上，代币有能力将合作社原则直接嵌入高度金融化的空间。毫不夸张地说，这是一枚硬币的两个重要方面，因此，不应该忽视代币化。代币可能是解锁所有权经济的一把钥匙，但为了实现这种未来的更公平版本，我们必须现在就参与基于代币的分发、仲裁和治理来打造文化。这一点很重要，因为与合作社的份额不同，许多可当作治理权的代币可以在二级市场上出售。这使得进入组织的条件更容易，但 DAO 可以从合作社对长期主义的强调中学习，通过围绕代币授予、有限的可转让性或更多实验性机制建立更多的文化模式。\n\n就像 DAO 可以从合作社的案例研究中学习一样，在双向交换中， DAO 可以向合作社引入更多形式的去中心化治理。这是 Morshed Mannan 在「[用区块链技术培育工人合作社：殖民地项目的教训](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774)」一书中提出的例子，其中提到合作社经常面临“当实体跨越国界时的协调问题”，在其国际化进程中，“在参与性管理、相互监督和团结方面存在负面趋势”。 DAO 直接解决了合作社面临的困境，如资金、治理和跨司法管辖区的协调。将合作主义作为一种*协议*，而不是作为企业结构， DAO 可以用它们的新词鼓励一种可以超越传统界限的文化空间。\n\n## 公会时代\n\n[https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\nDAO 可能意外地接受了之前的合作社的操作原则，但它们也灵活借鉴其他类型网络文化。他们可以从大型多人在线游戏（MMOs）公会中学到很多东西。\n\n随着角色扮演电脑游戏在 20 世纪 90 年代上线，这意味着大量玩家可以共享一个游戏世界：一个具有各种目标、活动和子情节的环境。早期完整的 MMO 例子包括“领土在线（Realm Online）”、“网络创世纪（Ultima Online）”和“无尽的任务（EverQuest）”，它们催生了“魔兽世界”和“星战前夜（EVE Online）”等经典游戏。在许多例子中，玩家可以自由地在开放游戏世界叙事、情境支持和风险的大方向指导下设定自己的目标，因为这种叙事自由，玩家可以组成团队来完成单人玩家无法达到的共同目标。这些团体通常被称为公会、部落或联盟，参与者从 40 人到 1000 人不等，他们的目标包括击败难啃的敌人或制造有用的工具。\n\n为了实现这些目标，公会中出现了文化模式；有时候游戏世界开发者为公会发行的工具与他们的实际需求之间会出现不匹配。以 “星战前夜”为例，游戏世界开发者为玩家创造了一个创建公司的界面，让玩家能够分发股份。在实践中，这种分配股份的特性很少使用，因为它没有加强现有的文化模式。相反地，使用“星战前夜”的游戏浏览器和数据API，许多公会开发了自己的工具去完成特定的目标。游戏公会和 DAO 之间的相似之处可以在这里体现出来，因为当前的 DAO 浪潮倾向于使用组合工具的组合，例如将 Snapshot 投票平台连接到 Gnosis 安全的多签帐户，而不是过度预测参与者使用的平台。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\n尽管在 “星战前夜 ”中发行公司股票的特殊功能可能还未出现，但游戏公会经常会采用重新分配的经济做法。从 [Varrock](https://runescape.salmoneus.net/archived-projects-and-content/site-content/tips/world-1-trading.html) 到 [gold farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming)，MMO 市场对于去中心化金融的巨大重要性将在后面的文章中讨论，但有一种经济实践可能与 DAO 密切相关：杀龙点数（DKP）。从历史上看，龙是 MMO 中最常见的敌人，DKP 作为公会内部或跨公会的分配系统出现。\n\n由公会执行的复杂而持久的任务，如杀死一条龙，通常被称为团本，其长度从几个小时到几天不等。在团本结束时，被杀死的敌人会掉落游戏中的战利品，公会必须决定如何分配这些战利品。因为公会需要不同且互补的玩家技能，“同样的人再次合作很重要”，公会分配战利品的方式必须让成员觉得公平。随着公会的成熟，它们通常会发展出不同的战利品分配系统，例如从随机分配开始，逐渐向参与程度加权的随机分配发展，最后通过非正式的评分系统（如DKP）实现分配。DKP 是一种私人货币系统，独立于游戏世界中现有的货币，公会成员可以通过参与团本获得这些货币。公会成员可以选择在团本后用这些点数换取战利品。\n\nDKP 最初是由一个公会在1999年为“无尽的任务” 这一 MMO 设计的，[它的实践](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points)已经被许多游戏世界中的许多公会所采纳，尽管略有调整。Ed Castranova 和 Joshua Fairfield 在“[杀龙点数：白皮书概述](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)：Leftovers DKP 系统” 详细介绍了一个例子，它最大限度地增加了系统中的参与者数量，而不是绑定在一个特定的公会。正如 Castranova 和 Fairfield 所写的，“事实上，这个组织实际上是群体中最高效的分配机构。如果在（“魔兽世界”服务器） Silver Hand 上有一个应急政府，那就是Leftovers 。” Leftovers DKP 系统针对一些限制应运而生：战利品只能在战斗结束后获得，在“魔兽世界”中，不能在玩家之间转移。Leftovers DKP 系统有一个非正式任命的管理者小组：玩家通过公屏聊天辛苦地设置和维护 DKP 中战利品物品价格的数据库。当掉落战利品时，拥有 DKP 的玩家可以选择用它们购买特定的道具，所有的出价和交易都是公开的。由于是零和机制， LeftoversDKP 系统会将消耗的 DKP 点数平均分配给所有参与团本的其他公会成员。\n\nCastranova 和 Fairfield 指出，DKP 补充现有的游戏世界的货币，为有效配置社会凝聚力，“使时间尽可能（花在这些团本中得不到补偿的时间）转换成物品（在这些团本中获得个人所赢取的战利品）”(22)。特别是在 “魔兽世界” 中，因为战利品不能在玩家之间转移，所以拥有战利品本身也具有强大的信号功能，表明玩家在一段时间内确实参与了团本。这个 DKP 系统早于今天开发中的 DAO 平台的机制，如 Aragon、Colony 和 DAOstack，这些平台都提供了基于成员参与的分配声誉代币的机制，这些成员由于成功的提案、资助或活动而得到奖励：在其他游戏世界中可能被称为团本。这些声誉代币补充了 DAO 平台支持的其他经济系统，例如 DAO 特定的代币或其多签帐户库中的其他资产，通常被用作富豪 “1代币1票”模型的替代模型，是通过参与而不是购买力获得，这样，给 DAO 提供了随时间而积累的更大的投票权。DAO 还可以向 DKP 学习，DKP 作为基于参与的私人货币系统，可以用于其他数字资产，而不仅仅只能是随着时间而积累。\n\n除了有效的分配、情境声誉和信号功能，DKP 系统对 DAO 还有另一个重要意义：通常所有公会都独立于传统法院系统来解决纠纷，尽管这些纠纷涉及昂贵的利益。这与 DAO 工具高度相关，比如 Aragon 的数字司法管辖区或 [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) 的去中心化仲裁服务，旨在提供互联网本地争议解决工具。事实上，DAO 工具常常试图从技术上解决游戏公会已经在文化上改进了几十年的问题，现在可能是 DAO 和游戏公会更紧密地融合他们的实践知识的时候了。\n\n![EVE Online 中一些游戏联盟的公会列，2006](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F5504ac03-20c1-4dba-83a6-efda8d3a4077.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n游戏公会的另一个微妙的文化模式与他们的经济结构有关。正如研究员 Joshua Citarella 所指出，许多 DKP 体系类似于一种市场社会主义形式，在这种形式中，商品是公有的，但由市场分配(23)。Citarella 继续指出，尽管 DKP 系统与市场社会主义相似，而且参与其中的玩家普遍感到快乐，但这些玩家中的许多人显然不会在政治上接受市场社会主义的标签。当一个团体通过一种经济形式进行运作时，“影子经济学”可能是一个恰当的术语，它不会给自己贴上这样的标签：DAO 是合作协议，游戏公会是市场社会主义。这一趋势使得游戏公会等有趣的政治领域未得到充分开发，因为游戏公会通常不需要佩戴它们的旗帜。某种程度上，这可能更像是一个特性而不是 bug ，因为像 DAO 这样的新术语的发明而不是对标准的依赖，在一定程度上激发了他们的热情。\n\n[https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\n尽管这可能会导致忽略它们的史前史，但 DAO 仍然保持着一种强大的模糊性，在这种模糊性中，它们迅速增长的政治野心还没有完全具备熟悉的美学表达。这可以用于几个不同的目的。例如，我们可以想象一个 DAO ，当全球气温上升超过 2 摄氏度时，它的金库就会自毁，就[像 terra0 的 NFT](https://terra0.medium.com/two-degrees-nft-5af1263bfcc)，伴随着一个闪闪发光的、谦逊的吉祥物化身。\n\n这样的 DAO 可能会吸引其他一些人参加，这些人不会被大多数气候项目为人熟知的绿色美学所吸引，DAO 还可能通过创造围绕它的新文化来扩大政治目标的参与。新事物的势头总是对某些事情有利，问题现在变成了——如何培养能够跨越意识形态分歧而打造秘密团结的 DAO。\n\n## 一个新想法诞生了\n\n![事实上，DAO 可能是上图的任何一种形态。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F482156a6-7f32-475a-b467-0e0b8c4648c7.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n虽然去中心化自治组织的全面史前史可以让我们更深入了解过去，但 DAO 的许多支持者对 DAO 对未来的影响有一个核心信念：DAO 可以通过超越现代企业的合作来超越竞争。\n\n20世纪，许多经济学家问，当由市场定价的服务在理论上更有效率时，为什么会出现公司？罗纳德·科斯 （Ronald Coase）在 《[企业的本质](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)》 一书中探讨了这个问题的答案，得出的结论是，市场产生了无法解释的交易成本。这些交易成本，可能来自于价格发现、合同谈判或采用服务，可以通过将服务保留在企业中得以降低。根据这一理论，企业的规模可能有他们不会超过的实际限制，因为最终交易成本会通过部门官僚制等发展而增加。尽管这一理论有许多批评，但 DAO 的前景可以与其相关联： DAO 渴望在扩展时变得更高效(25)。虽然在实践中，这一愿望还远未得到证实，但在某些方面， DAO 承诺通过使用技术治理协议来降低交易成本。回到上面的一个例子，像 Gnosis Safe 这样的 DAO 工具使匿名小组能够在几分钟内跨司法管辖区汇集和管理资金。建立一个传统的联合银行账户可能需要几个月的时间，某些情况下，来自不同司法管辖区的个人不可能共同管理一个银行账户。通过公共区块链的支持，DAO 可以在不增加运营交易成本的情况下，将更深入的实践知识纳入治理：期望随着规模的扩大变得“更高效”。\n\n虽然像 Gnosis Safe 这样的 DAO 工具现已实现了这一点，但总的来说，对无限可伸缩组织的承诺，仍有很长的路要走。通常，即使是 DAO 的承诺也会掩盖它们在实践中的效用。 Jaya Klara Brekke、Kate Beecroft 和 Francesca Pick 在 “[异议协议：管理在线同伴社区的差异](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full)” 中着重介绍了 Genesis DAO 的案例研究，这是一个围绕着 DAOstack 平台的集体。他们写道:\n\n> Genesis DAO 是许多 DAO 共有的独特特性的一个很好的例子，也就是说，它们包含了积极性很高的团队，这些团队围绕一组关于治理的思想而形成的，而不是将治理作为实现某些共同使命的手段。换句话说，它以工具为中心，并专注于一个主要行动：为项目分配资金。陌生人在没有时间建立一致和信任的情况下，立即开始共同做财务决定，这是很罕见的。事实上，这正是像 Genesis DAO 这样项目的承诺：该技术将绕过建立信任关系的需要，这意味着成千上万的人将能够围绕目标、采取行动，甚至作为一个团队一起花钱。\n\n就像上文提到的 “星战前夜” 玩家不使用界面去分发游戏开发者所发行的公司股票一样，我们必须重新考虑以工具为中心的开发，以及工具自动创造有用文化模式的假设。与减少信任关系需求的治理技术协议不同，DAO 可以通过迭代开发高度可组合的工具，来协调不同级别的一致性和信任。最终，DAO 追求的效率可能不是定义为一种经济功能，而是一种“更好的”的治理：一种由[无限游戏](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games)中更深入的实践知识支持的治理。\n\n## DAO 的分层\n\nDAO 不会是某些人想象的那种统一的非层次网络。相反，DAO 在不同级别的一致性和信任之间进行协调。在《[加密网络的所有权](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)》 一书中，Patrick Rawson 认为，对于 DAO 来说，为了实现有意义的工作，“将所有权分配给具有更专门目标的小队式实体，是需要解决的关键长期问题”。这些“小队式实体”是具有信任关系的小型团队，可能与上述例子中的游戏公会不同，它们与 DAO 一起执行价值一致的任务。仔细观察，高效的 DAO 开始表现更像团队网络，就像有 100 个附属合作社的 [MONDRAGON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) 公司网络，而不是从远处看起来松散协调的群体智能。受 Rawson 分析的启发，我们可以大致勾勒出 DAO 的三层：\n\n![](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fe7260512-1458-4aac-bc0a-cbca9d6d532d.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n1. **代币**：根据代币所有权排列的多组织网络\n2. **团队**：由代币所有权代表的团队、公会和小队\n3. **任务**：由代币所有权资助的任务、里程碑和突袭\n\n从这三层中，一个***分层***的网络出现了，这意味着一个组织具有以多种方式进行排列的能力。\n\n![一个例子：在 DAO 中代币，小队和任务在 DAO 的不同网络中被分配，这些都可以通过多种方式排名或分类。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F3aedd8d4-58c2-4273-bc91-3761d7f8a995.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在优先分配所有权的生态系统中，代币鼓励 DAO 网络由其成员管理。代币、小队和任务并不局限于单个 DAO 的准机构边界，但为了可以且能够为了有意义分布化控制网络，应该用多个 DAO 中的代币所有权来表示。一个类似于跨国公司控制网络的生态系统出现了，但重要的是，一个没有单一指挥中心的生态系统，不同信任水平之间的交易成本降低了。正如 Rawson 所写的，“只要集体内存在给定的\\[ DAO 网络\\]内自由循环，就可以再次使用已发现的解决方案。”当我们将 DAO 视为根据代币所有权协调的多组织网络时，DAO 工具的目的不仅是支持一个团队的操作，而且促进多个团队的协作。由 PrimeDAO 资助的 [DAO-to-DAO (D2D) 协作机制](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21)是沿着这些路线进行的最具前瞻性的工作，它可能最终超越传统的 B2B 产品。从潜行模式中出现了一个新的小队式实体，[Gnosis 公会](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de)团队同样强调了 DAO-to-DAO 工具，形成了一个名为 [Zodiac](http://) 的 DAO 工具包。\n\n回顾 DAO 的承诺，他们将更深入的实践知识整合到治理中的潜力，并不意味着每个项目提案中的决策必须涉及越来越多的成员；而是在一个 DAO 的网络，拥有最相关的专业知识的团队可以很容易在整个生态系统进行共享。当我们将 DAO 视为不同团队形成的星座，而不是庞然大物时，DAO 就变成了允许集体记忆自由流动的网络。\n\n## 未来的网络\n\n本文中的 TIMN RAND 报告以一个引人好奇的注解结束。它写道：\n\n> 很多关于为信息时代重新设计组织的文献都关注于生产——提高生产率，或者制造波音 777 喷气式客机之类的新产品。然而，这不是反映了一种挥之不去的工业时代心态吗？生产组织仍然是组织生态的重要组成部分。不过，我们也应该考虑“感官组织”。感官功能与生产功能有很大的不同，需要不同的组织方式，比如，更多的网络连接到办公室边界之外的世界。在未来的几年里，为各种感官组织确定合适的设计，可能会成为创新研究和发展的一个很好的元主题。\n\n这段结语呼应了20世纪媒体理论家马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）时代的流行话题，麦克卢汉强调数字媒体如何影响我们的感官神经系统。如果像 DAO 这样的主要数字网络首先在我们的神经系统上运作，这并不意味着 DAO 不会来重组、重塑和重新分配我们的物质世界。有些人仍然拒绝认真对待以下事：即合作原则、游戏公会以及如 FAO 这样组织的奇怪想象场景，呈现了一种具有合法政治相关性的新兴组织形式。我们现在必须在政治上认真对待它们，这样它们就不会只由数字鸿沟一边的人来塑造。DAO 与 [PAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee) (为美国选举候选人筹集资金的政治行动委员会) 并行时代即将到来。正如市场并没有使国家这一形态过时，而是在削弱一些运作的同时加强其他一些运作，DAO 也为自治社会部门产生的传统政治参与引入了新的形式：[网络联盟](https://1729.com/network-union/)。\n\n![Trust’s Mascot Streams 中的角色, ARB and GVN908, 2021](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Ff59011fe-b6aa-42e6-9344-daab85c5976a.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n为了提醒人们注意嵌合术语在严肃性方面的缺陷，许多人回到了它的误称：DAO 中的“A”不符合自治的含义；而另一些人，比如研究员 [Aude Launay](https://twitter.com/audelau/status/1413731529042321410)，则援引了 DAO 的政治自治精神，而不是技术自治精神。尽管 DAO 这个术语在诗意上仍然是正确的，但我们可以偶尔提出一个替代品：去中心化的化身组织。这样的组织在政治意义上可轻可重。正如台湾诗人兼数字部长 Audrey Tang 所言，“化身政治家”的时代已经到来(28)。化身政治家是代表政治平台进行代表、召集和倡导的[虚拟存在](https://www.virtual-beings-summit.com/)；当自动化增加时，化身政治家甚至可能生成自己的政治平台。一个去中心化的化身组织会意识到即将到来的虚拟时代精神：它可能看起来像[集体管理的生化电子人（赛博格）](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1345110226744184833)，如 [Lil Miquela](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Miquela)，或是由成员塑造的完整环境，如 [Trust 的移动城堡](https://trust.support/)。去中心化的化身组织将共同开发、交互操作游戏世界、引擎或虚拟吉祥物，作为其核心，共同创造其成员组织的文化。\n\n![Jay Springett , 世界运行，指南：关于创造世界和运行世界的思辨性文件](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F6fa40349-2cd0-41c2-8680-ffde9154743b.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n通过学习其史前历史，DAO 可以走向一种组织的融合理论，这意味着融合广泛的文化模式、实践和影响，同时承认其继承的政治偏见的一种理论。为了避免对治理的技术协议盲目崇拜的趋势，去中心化的化身组织必须培养玩家想要居住的引人注目的环境，认识到叙事、美学和共同的目标是他们成功的关键。巴洛写道，让互联网不仅成为交易场所，还要成为关系和思想本身的场所，这些都依赖于这些叙述的深度。就像大型多人在线游戏一样，与其说 DAO 是用于管理的技术协议，不如说是相互交织的高风险游戏世界。\n\n我们应该以大致的共识和运行世界为目标。\n\n*本文是 [@keikreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler?lang=de) 连接加密网络、web3 和游戏的 [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de)

基金、Chamas 和其他形式的 P2P 储蓄或信贷协会等，诸如此类的去中心化加密协议，将成为改写金融关系的先头兵。\n\n这些小队原型是科斯定理发挥作用的例证——即强大的内部协调能力降低了交易成本，让小型团体获得更大的产能和金融机会。\n\n这些点对点团体通常由邻居和朋友组成，其非正式的属性揭示了信任在小队中所发挥的核心作用。无论是同屋室友还是分享 Discord 群组的伙伴，小队允许社会货币和金融资本相互转换，为小型团体创造了机会和韧性，而这些都不可能靠单打独斗实现。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmT-rZoi43q0_tCYZrYRC.png?height=1172&width=2000)\n\n近期发生的一系列事件让个别机构的局限性暴露无遗，小队这种组织形式的韧性成为刚需。新冠大流行是这些社会粘合剂中最新的一个：物理上我们保持距离，情感上我们越发紧密。当疫情来袭时，首要任务是确保小队的安全，协调和决策的需求接踵而至。\n\n但如今群体凝聚力文化的出现，是城市生活中社会和经济动荡双重驱动的结果。那些在同一个屋檐下分担租金的人成了家人。被一线城市排挤的人们抱团取暖，在缺乏社会保障网的失业市场中偷生。\n\n小队既是当代社会原子化的产物，也是对原子化社会的回应。＂去北边搞块地＂的说法，标志着城市年轻居民渴望基于小队的新型农庄。立队为家是现代版的[返土归田运动](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement)——把受「全球概览」启发出现的战后公社，变为后互联网冲浪俱乐部在微博上宣扬共居、生态文化园和太阳能网络等美德。\n\n小队文化是新自由个人主义的对立面。千禧一代正在从几十年的嘲讽中毒症中恢复，重新发现彼此互生的探索性关系是什么样子。有了在「我的世界」、「DOTA 2」和「堡垒之夜」等游戏中组队的经历，年轻一代已经被注入了极其强大的小队能量。\n\n![撇开军事含义不谈，私聊群的出现，迎来了＂小队＂话语权的新时代。（译者：上图显示了“squad”在谷歌 Ngram Viewer 搜索中的上升趋势，关于Ngram Viewer，详见：https://books.google.com/ngrams/info）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B9GQjsGOo6ovhR0ElVST6.png?height=740&width=1437)\n\n不管是为了生存还玩乐而凑到一起，当下的危机催生的小队组织将充满韧性。有了跨越时空的网络空间，距离将不再成为障碍——很快，生机勃勃的文化将由那些胜似亲人的小队成员们担纲演绎。团体合作现已成为强大的默认共识，将小队置于社会、文化和经济生活的中心。借用 K-HOLE 的说法：如今人作为个体出生，不得不去寻找团体归属。\n\n## 小队理论\n\n在古代，人们聚到一起组成小队是为了挣扎求存；而如今，永远在线的群组交流则为小队文化的形成创造了条件。群聊和相应的团队工作空间，创造了共同背景和群体记忆。小队的一个必要条件是这种持续存在感：共存共现。\n\n但小队不止是一个松散的关系网络，它是一个连续体。小队形成的第二个先决条件是自我认同。它不是你或我，而是我们。这个支柱往往紧随第一个支柱。一开始小队可能只是个临时发起的 Telegram 频道，但很快人们口中的＂那个群＂就变成了小队的代名词。\n\n为了实现对自身的整体认知，小队用极强的群体规范来保持边界。去他喵的邓巴数字吧——理想的小队不超过 12 人。超过这个数量的人要真正做到一起协同怎么可能呢？对紧密协调来说，小型群组至关重要。小队可能被更大的网络环绕，使它从外面看上去大且混沌。但是对于核心成员来说，一个无形的圈子限定并保护了群体认同的空间。\n\n随着**小队 VIBE** 的增长，队内成员在社交、情感和财务方面相互依赖和资源共享的可能性也在增加。持续的社会化和不断加深的自我认同带来了相互之间的信赖，成为探索小队共同能力的基础。**小队文化**才刚刚[萌芽](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJ7yW7Y3RY)。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DZby1JkYnXxk7We1dWdxJ.png?height=450&width=640)\n\n## 小队空间\n\n这场新冠大流行翻转了在真实世界里共享空间的剧本，但我们国内的新现状，无非是线上屡见不鲜的模式在物理世界中的翻版。最初人们设想的只是一系列相互链接的文档，到头来 Web2.0 的大规模产品化把互联网变成了一系列相互连接的领地。\n\n今天的小队是数字化群落的体现，崭新的小队时代迫使我们重新思考早期社交网络的个体化逻辑。与超文本的初衷相反，互联网没有成为任由个体穿梭其间的单一万维网（WWW）。如今上网犹如踏进全球竞技场；大众社交媒体成了危机四伏的杀戮地带，没有团队的支持，任何人都无法穿行。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uuPSBgRLyCihb2ZIXQUot.png?height=1476&width=2680)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wQU1oCryRzlUw3JOnseJL.png?height=1452&width=2702)\n\n上面显示的 Twitter 亚文化只是庞大社交深网的一小部分。在这个飘渺的图景之下便是小队空间──数字微文化诞生的内在网络：私聊群、Discord、Slack、Keybase。模因（meme）在小队空间中孕育成型，破茧而出，干翻 [牛肉网](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/) 上的NPC。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5e8taRmTRdBEBk07Otu5g.png?height=497&width=2000)\n\n小队文化是小队空间的下游，而小队栖居的数字场所只会越来越先进。Discord 突然可以一起语音连线了；Keybase 现在也能使用 Git 了。[团队能力取决于工具](https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/)，不同的平台上形成了不同的思想模式。小队空间不仅指环境，它还是一个连续体和共识层。小队空间是策划惊天交易、孕育奇思妙想和涌现 meme 风潮的所在。小队成员可能时空各异，但在这个空间里，每个人的时间都是小队时间。[新建一个私聊群就能开启小队元年](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes/)。\n\n群体动态潮涨潮落无非因势利导，而小队空间就是这一切的核心。生态学把这个过程称为 \"小生境形成\"。网络上，它叫做＂小队文化＂。\n\n## 小队 VIBES\n\n在社交深网的地下洞穴里，我们选中的亲人们发展出自己的文化。小队不需要自己的微货币——图像、艺术、音乐、照片、水帖，还有烤肉，都是原生的交换媒介。小队也同样不太需要内部财务激励。相反，好玩的交换活动产生了信任、互惠和 VIBE——小队最为重视却不可言喻的群体能量。因此，小队生产的核心恰恰正是其自身的生生不息。\n\n加密模因学（memetics）的力量证明，一帮乌合之众有能力在自己晦涩的社会框架中，定义出新的价值形式。meme 制造的＂资产＂无法以传统方式估价，但却能引领文化和经济运动。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-f6kiuBBCd5liHKhmNIUc.png?height=1250&width=2000)\n\nMeme、梗图、黑话、𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼.….. 这些都是只有小队才能搞出来的东西，也是小队制品的主流。它们散发着强大的小队 VIBE，而 VIBE 能勾魂摄魄。外人想要雨露均沾——有时是为了获得社交资本，有时是为了内容的战略价值，归根结底则是因为这股能量有感染力。当私聊群再也容纳不了内心的熊熊火焰之后，一些小队便开始将其社交产品外部化。播客分明是为他们天造地设的趁手工具；快速出版将 meme 变成了白皮书，土生土长的小队幽默像洪水一般席卷了创意市场。\n\n不管是机缘巧合还是事出有因，一旦相聚，小队的创意生产就变得潜力无穷。[VIBE](https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview) 是一点就着的高爆信息弹。在制造 VIBE 的过程中，小队可能会无心插柳地创造出 [去中心化品牌](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/)、虚拟人物和连他们自己也无法掌控的匿名实体。如此这般，驾驭了 vibe 的小队，从年幼懵懂中蜕变，成为创造无尽能量的源泉。\n\n[https://otherinter.net/2020_VIBES.mp4](https://otherinter.net/2020_VIBES.mp4)\n\n## 小队生产\n\n群组认同、共享空间、vibe──这些不仅创造了社交资本，而且加强了小队的组织能力，使交易成本最小化，并带来更大的产能和韧性，这是\"[小队的天性](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)\"。然而，虽然小队可以被看作是一种＂合同关系＂，却与科斯理论中的公司不同，它们没有法律结构。相反，社会契约通过 [相互尊重和内部规范](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/the-vibes-theory-of-organisational-design-937a73f791cd) 等心照不宣的纽带来实现。\n\n但为了维持这种互助经济，小队可能得寻找方法将 vibe 转化为公众可以参与的盈利模式：客户、订阅用户、赞助商、音乐交易、收成等。小队生产从创建流程和交互界面开始，将创造性劳动转化为可由全网用户传播的内容。在这里，小队工具开始发挥作用。在 DAW、Figma 板上或在游戏大厅里产生的 vibe 被转化为文化消费品。然后就轮到发行了。年轻的艺术家们创造了在线画廊和独立厂牌，这些为人熟知的组织模式有助于小队与世界互动（和交易）。Bandcamps、Twitch 页面、DAO 都是可供小队与其信任边界之外的实体互动的公共 API。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qii-UvJ9mWQ2_sL1ikXZa.png?height=1119&width=2000)\n\n一些数字工具是公共接口，而另一些则用于内部协调。如今小队基础设施由简单的软件构件组成：Venmo，Splitwise，Cash App。这些应用帮助小队成员尽最大可能避免向朋友要钱的尴尬，从而成为促进内部协调的金融管道。尽管小队韧性是必需的素质，但社会上素来对于＂一小群人管钱＂持怀疑态度，成了朋友间经济交流的主要障碍。\n\n软件内的预算跟踪、投票和掷硬币等功能，在社会协议和技术解决方案之间提供了一个中间点。例如，要确保 Splitwise 上记录的开支数据准确，很大程度上依靠的是社会规范。而让个人采用一套可追溯的结算规则，就可以降低群体的社会摩擦和协调成本。多一些小队不假思索就能使用的重要功能，可以促进文明的进步。\n\n有些人认为新软件可以解放＂个人创作者＂。但这种想法会不可避免地导致 Uber 化的雇佣劳动者中介平台。我们要解放小队。作为一个社会，我们今天所需要的工具应当以团体为基本用户。然而很少有软件能让小队作为一个整体合作生产并共同创造财富。为了充分实现小队文化，这种情况必须改变。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QVNp86GOuttS7X-MTNf6S.png?height=996&width=1554)\n\n## 小队财富\n\n有了即插即用的新金融工具，小队具备了更好的经济和社会韧性。个人获得复利回报可能机会有限，但群组却能在风险回报曲线上游刃有余。\n\n为小队做贡献是正和游戏，作为回报，成员可以获得更多的机会，对未来的经济状况有所诉求，并得到小队的支持和保障。通过风险共担，一个斗志昂扬的小队更是可以收益倍增，这就是──通往小队财富之路。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7LwTSppT69SevxxSsmNkn.png?height=568&width=1618)\n\n强大的社会结构和正确的技术堆栈将释放新一轮自下而上的经济实验：无息 P2P 借贷、匿名贷款池、集体保险、社会化 ETF、自由职业者 DAO 联盟、轮流储蓄计划、共享收益公会、meme 风投集团、加密庞氏、防诈骗、浏览器挖矿、郊外收益农场、男孩乐队、邪典电影和主权度假基金。\n\n有一点很清楚：如何获得资金和创造资产是关键。小队现在需要的是技术基础设施，以捕获并复合共同生产的价值。\n\n虽然金钱让小队得以维持，但过早地接入金融基础设施会扼杀其活力。 小*队经济主要从非货币形式的价值中收获*。**小队财富** 是每天产出 5 个 meme ，是 e-girls 的假期，是抖音喧嚣的房间，是你的伙伴们在郊区租下的空教堂。**小队财富** 是当 Discord 弹出消息的时候，它带给你的快乐比每周 70 小时的忙碌能换来的还要多。千禧一代都想辞掉工作，跑去创办风险投资公司，而小队已经更进一步，在做其他事情了。\n\n小队对新自由主义 [零工经济 ＂就业＂](https://onezero.medium.com/the-gig-economy-is-failing-say-hello-to-the-hustle-economy-13ae3aa91954) 的承诺和准社会化个人品牌那一套看得门儿清。小队所推崇的个人自决，不是通过个人主义，而是借由集体维护和彼此关怀得以实现。小队重视创造性的表达，但荣耀归于群体更甚于创作者个人。对小队来说，自主性始终带着集体的属性。\n\n*但是，小团体能规模化吗？*小队首先是文化，而不是企业。财富最大化不是他们的主要目标——小队只想让 vibe 继续。稳定的收入本身就是一个值得称道的成就。\n\n相反，通过发明新的美学、组织形式和创意产品，小队能够实现横向拓展，成为其他人的模板。当小队的 vibe 传播时，它们就有了自己的生命。虽然这些模式的物质价值可能有限，但绝不要低估将一个自下而上的新经济模式 meme 化的意义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NYHkLynpLa9D0nPSza2kw.png?height=365&width=495)\n\n在未来的几年里，小队将和公司一样重要。随着我们社会和经济微观结构的变化，强大的 vibe 和可持续性将成为衡量成功的新标准。小队不需要扩大规模，就可以传播大团队的能量。\n\n## 小队大能量\n\n小队大能量到底有多大？小队确实是数字工具加持的一帮伙伴，但它的意义远不止于新聊天软件或在线＂社区平台＂。这是一场运动。小队的领域所包含的，是在日益复杂的世界里，一起学习和创造意义的新方式。小队是由 vibe, meme 和价值观驱动的群体，但不是无意识的蜂群；相反，小队是以自己的方式参与世界运转的原型机构。\n\n**小队是我们重新对价值做出的定义**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AVg6oXVzcSnCmwAcWvTrL.png?height=1000&width=2000)\n\n**小队是一个共享的环境，充盈富饶**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35dUthf_tVuOi_XsAYRgK.png?height=1914&width=3060)\n\n**小队效应让数字网络始料未及……**\n\n**小队是历史终点的终结者**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pv63jRq_fmDx24XrWXAZ1.png?height=1728&width=2868)\n\n**小队有益健康**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/twF-kuFpeDf0lBelPRhIG.png?height=1978&width=3104)\n\n**小队

以此为噱头，为其最具代表性的产品——“高潮”系列唇膏和腮红——推出了系列 NFT。\n\n去年夏天，NARS 与三位女性艺术家（DJ Nina Kravis、Azede Jean-Pierre 和 Sara Shakeel）合作，创作了一套非同质化代币（NFT）。\"这些作品的灵感来自于——高潮，\"NARS 的全球数字战略副总裁 Dina Fierro 说，\"它的灵感来自于概念、生理反应，当然还有产品在感官上带来的灵感\"。\n\n这些 NFT 名为 “Take Me”， “Consume Me” 和 “Captivate Me”。其中一个描绘了一个女人的嘴唇被打开，波浪从中涌出。在另一个中，一种桃红色的液体（“高潮” 系列产品的颜色）有节奏地，诱人地来回涌动。正如 NARS 在其

Crossing）中投放了七款定制设计产品。Fierro 说，在谈到新技术时，传统上，美容和时尚品牌总是 \"在对话中落伍\"，拥抱电子商务和社交媒体的速度很慢。但在元宇宙这方面则不然。\n\n\"我在行业内观察到的是，在元宇宙方面大家是绝不会屈居人后的。” Fierro 说。\n\n现在看来，整个商业世界都是如此，\"进入元宇宙的公司 \"的名单感觉比 \"没有进入元宇宙的公司 \"的名单更长。(元宇宙是一个无法定义的，庞大的数字世界概念，它可以指像 Decentraland 这样基于区块链的世界，也可以是[沃尔玛的增强现实世界](https://www.xrtoday.com/virtual-reality/walmart-targets-metaverse-to-build-future-of-retail/)。)\n\n举几个例子：苏富比拍卖行在 Decentraland 开设了一家[画廊](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/04/sothebys-opens-virtual-replica-of-its-london-galleries-in-decentraland/)。阿迪达斯与 The Bored Ape Yacht Club 合作，推出 \"Into the Metaverse \"NFT。Gucci 在 Roblox（一个用户可以制作游戏的虚拟世界，其玩家有[50%是16岁以下的孩子](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite)）创建了一个艺术装置作品。可口可乐设计了 \"[Friendship NFTs](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/01/17/5-brands-already-boldly-embracing-the-metaverse)\"，是 \"为元宇宙重新设计的\"。酒厂 19 Crimes，将增强现实技术植入产品，当你[扫描酒瓶](https://19crimes.com/pages/living-labels)时，可以看到 \"罪犯 \"在向你讲述一个故事。Balenciaga 将高级时装带入《堡垒之夜》。甚至 [SPACs](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/07/06/what-is-a-spac-your-questions-answered/)（译者注：特殊目的收购公司）也在[进入元宇宙](https://fortune.com/2022/02/04/spacs-metaverse-investing-reutrns-virtual-reality/)。这样的例子不胜枚举。\n\n但在过去的几个月里，有些事情发生了转变。\n\n\"去年，很多\\[公司\\]都是为了公关宣传而做这些事情，你做得越早，你得到的关注就越多，\"专门研究元宇宙的营销顾问 Cathy Hackl 说。\"现在，这种新鲜感已经消失了。你可能会得到短暂的流量，但没什么实质的收益。公司真正关注的是长期发展。\" Hackl 说，公司不再仅仅是涉足元宇宙，而是在 \"审视最全面的元宇宙战略。\"\n\n例如，耐克[提交](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/nike-is-quietly-preparing-for-the-metaverse-.html)了大量与元宇宙相关的商标申请。这家运动鞋制造商，还发布了虚拟材料设计师等与元宇宙有关的职位空缺，成立了一个数字产品创作小组，并收购了 RTFKT（一家加密可穿戴设备工作室）。当微软宣布将斥资 700 亿美元收购一家视频游戏公司时，它说[原因是元宇宙](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/business/microsoft-activision-blizzard.html)。Facebook 现在以两件事而闻名：更名 Meta 进军元宇宙和股价下跌。在苹果 1 月份的财报电话会议上，蒂姆·库克说，元宇宙\"对我们来说非常有趣\"，他指出，苹果在应用商店中有超过 14000 个增强现实套件应用，因此 \"我们看到了这个领域的巨大潜力，并正在进行相应的投资\"。\n\n但这种 \"潜力 \"到底是什么？究竟主流公司希望从中得到什么？答案明显是 \"钱\"，因为 Grayscale [估计](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/25/grayscale-says-metaverse-is-a-trillion-dollar-market-opportunity/)在元宇宙中有 1 万亿美元的市场机会。(Grayscale，即灰度，是 CoinDesk 的母公司 Digital Currency Group 的一个部门；DCG 也是 Decentraland 的重要投资者）。但是，具体是怎么做到呢？Hackl 列举了一些典型要素：宣传、客户获取、客户参与、客户保留，以及——也许是最让人感兴趣的奖励——新的收入来源。\n\n数字服装，数字自行车，在你的 Decentraland 家中，对楼上的浴室进行数字化装修。听起来很疯狂是吗？花 290 万美元买一只数字猿的想法也是如此，但这都是真的。\" Threedium 公司的首席营销官Michael Toner 说：\"我们现在正在进入这个时代，在这里，我们对数字所有权的重视程度，与我们对实体所有权的重视程度相当。“\n\nToner 说，这个数字所有权的世界与我们目前的现实世界并没有什么不同。\n\n\"今天，人们已经习惯于购买数字资产和购买电子书。这对人们来说不是一个奇怪的概念，\" Toner 说，将这一概念扩展到数字 \"手表、小玩意、装饰品和绘画\"，并不需要大费周章。\n\n他说，越来越多的客户希望创建现实世界物体的 \"数字双胞胎\"。例如，在即将举行的[元宇宙时装周](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/what-fashion-week-looks-like-in-the-metaverse)上，你可以直接从 Decentraland 上购买 Hugo Boss 的实体衣服。在 Toner 看来，\"我们正在进入元电子商务时代\"。\n\n**元宇宙中的营销**\n\n如果说数字高潮是一个难做的买卖，那么销售数字啤酒似乎也同样棘手。但在 2020 年，时任百威英博啤酒集团——这家公司拥有百威啤酒、科罗娜啤酒、贝克啤酒以及几乎所有非精酿普通啤酒——全球创新主管的 Lindsey McInerney 却有一种预感，它可能会成功。\n\nLindsey McInerney 不是那种典型的营销主管。她写过一篇关于 20 世纪 70 年代滑板场景的论文，她研究了黑客主义的诞生，她更关心文化而不是公司。然后现实来袭，她才意识到她的 \"文化研究 \"学位没有实际效用。所以她转向了公关，但\"差点被公关学校踢出来\"，因为她的新闻稿中包含了一个（当时还是）新的、不被认可的网站——YouTube——的链接。这在当时是被禁止的，现在则是标准操作。\n\nMcInerney 总是逆向思维，在成为 Web2 社交媒体专家的同时（在社交媒体舆情服务公司 Hootsuite，负责创新），她一直关注着虚拟现实和区块链。当她被百威英博聘用时，你以为她会专注于啤酒、啤酒花和大麦，并没有。McInerney 写了一篇关于 Web3 和元宇宙的论文，这让她的同事感到惊讶，因为她认为这是公司需要了解的 \"地震式转变\"。\n\n\"这就是地震，\" McInerney 说，并重复强调了这一点，\"这比社交媒体要大得多。它和电子商务比则是旗鼓相当，只大不小。\"她说，\"元宇宙和 Web3 的融合正在以我从未感受过的速度发生。从来没有这么快过。\"\n\n作为一个试点项目，McInerney 说服高层领导，为与加密赛马游戏 [Zed Run](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/27/fake-horses-real-bets-unikrn-is-putting-racetrack-nfts-on-ethereum/) 的合作开绿灯。（想想一场虚拟的肯塔基德比）（译者注：肯塔基德比是美国赛马三冠大赛第一关）。McInerney 有信心，公司的优质比尔森啤酒 Stella Artois（译者注：时代啤酒）的品牌形象与 Zed Run 的高端世界完全吻合，她将其描述为 \"元宇宙中最负盛名的游戏\"。百威英博投放了定制的 Stella Artois 皮肤（用于定制游戏角色的外观），拍卖了虚拟马匹，推出了一个新的三维赛马场。这种合作向百威英博多年来的 \"[The Life Artois](https://www.stellaartois.com/en_us/initiatives/the-life-artois/) \"活动致敬，而且主流啤酒品牌首次进入了元宇宙。\n\n结果试点项目取得了爆炸性进展。McInerney 说，该品牌在第一周获得了超过1亿的媒体流量，获得了《[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/18/stella-artois-gallops-into-the-metaverse-with-horse-racing-nfts/?sh=7267b9a57b8b)》和《广告周刊》的报道。她认为这只是未来发展的一个小小缩影。\"这不仅仅是关于电子商务的，\" McInerney 说，\"这也不仅仅是关于你在互联网上销售能力的未来，它是所有板块的未来。”\n\n另一个 \"板块\"：客户奖励计划。这是营销学的基本原理，会员计划中的客户——如常旅客账户——更忠诚，更有利可图。这只是一个开始。\n\n\"我们都知道会员计划有多糟糕，\"阿迪达斯的全球品牌传播经理 Kevin Wright 说，该公司已经大力投入到元宇宙中。\"哦，伙计，它们太糟糕了，糟透了，它们很麻烦。奖励\\[可能\\]是莫名其妙的。它们会过期。\" Wright 澄清说，现在还为时尚早，\"我们还没有搞清楚一切。\"但基于代币的会员计划，有可能提供更好的客户体验——比如说，可以编程，可以做某些事情，或者更容易转换和交换。其他 Web3 专家也同意，例如 Jeremiah Owyang，他最近[给了我这个预测](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/the-social-token-network-rally-friends-with-benefits-and-the-future-of-branding/)：\"品牌将把他们的忠诚度计划积分转化为社交代币\"。\n\n然后，Wright 还发现了元宇宙的一个隐藏优点：它还是一个会计游戏。Wright 说，当公司提供奖励计划时，这些积分为 \"品牌创造了巨大的财务责任\"。就像银行需要手头有充足的现金一样，公司需要抵御一种风险：客户积累的奖励积分——就像常客里程一样——可能爆发式集中兑换的风险。\n\n\"这种情况从未发生过，但如果每个人都想在同一天\\[兑换\\]他们的星巴克免费饮品，星巴克就有麻烦了，\" Wright 说。这就是为什么 \"会计成为了一场噩梦\"。Wright 说，元宇宙中基于代币的会员计划将解决这个令人头痛的财务问题。(确切的机制仍未确定，但这与[德勤报告](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-making-blockchain-real-for-loyalty-rewards-programs.pdf)指出的 \"无人认领的奖励，在公司的资产负债表上被视为负债 \"相吻合，并建议将其用基于区块链的代币替代。） \"我们花了很多时间与产品设计师讨论元宇宙，但我也想与我们的会计师讨论元宇宙，\" Wright 笑着说。\n\n还有其他不那么显而易见的应用场景。安永会计师事务所（原 Ernst & Young 会计师事务所）专注于元宇宙的顾问 Janet Balis 说，虽然大多数最初的案例都是针对 \"B-to-C\"（企业对消费者），但她预测我们将看到更多 B-to-B（企业对企业）的案例。想想在新冠疫情期间有多少贸易展变成了线上的。想想所有的 Zoom 会议。这些活动将来会有许多回到线下，但应该不会全都回去。\n\nBalis 说：\"我确实认为，在 B-to-B 的场景中，有些活动有机会在元宇宙中被办得更好，或者被元宇宙的体验所取代。“(有一家公司已经尝试了通过元宇宙增强体验的方式，CoinDesk，在新冠疫情的高峰期，在 Decentraland 的会议中心开了一次[虚拟大会](https://twitter.com/BitcoinLouie/status/1316740611945439232?s=20&t=KmJZq32fg2CkHUnta97fBA)）。\n\n然后还有公司内部的可能性。Balis 说：”这是一个在更有创意的环境中录用新员工的机会，即使人们在家里工作。“在她为《哈佛商业评论》写的[一篇文章](https://hbr.org/2022/01/how-brands-can-enter-the-metaverse)中（这是主流接受度的另一个信号），Balis 指出，元宇宙可以用来培训未来的外科医生，微软的 \"mesh \"平台在元宇宙式的协作空间中提供了化身，而芯片制造商”[英伟达相信](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/08/10/what-is-the-metaverse/)，投资于制造和物流等方面的元宇宙模拟技术，将减少浪费并加速更优商业解决方案的出现。\" 而现在波音公司正在元宇宙中[设计飞机](https://www.reuters.com/technology/boeing-wants-build-its-next-airplane-metaverse-2021-12-17/)。\n\n我好奇地想知道元宇宙在加密货币泡沫之外的延伸程度，于是我联系了一家传统的咨询公司 Want Branding，该公司与区块链毫无关系——其客户广泛，包括吉列和米高梅度假集团。\"我们与所有不同垂直领域的公司有较高水平的合作，每个人都在思考这个问题，\"该公司的首席营销官 John Downey 说，\"越来越多的客户问我们，从品牌的角度来看，进入元宇宙意味着什么？”\n\n安永会计师事务所也发现了同样的情况。\"我认为对于面向消费者的公司来说，绝大多数会有一个营销或客户体验高管，开始关注元宇宙，\" Balis 说。安永甚至有一个以元宇宙为中心的部门，最近还写了一篇题为 \" CEO 们，是时候进入元宇宙了 \"的[博文](https://www.ey.com/en_in/ceo/ceos-it-is-time-to-enter-the-metaverse)。安永的竞争对手德勤推出了自己的元宇宙商店，[宣布](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-launches-unlimited-reality-services.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:metapr:eng:cons:01132022:building%20a%20metaverse:b:c:kwd-1545562415717&gclid=Cj0KCQiAjc2QBhDgARIsAMc3SqQkNC07bCHfwsnybK00OyGGKEBGcvgghPTS_Yh1Ky-2ObvEnkqHQKkaAl9qEALw_wcB)成立 \"Unlimited Reality（无限现实）\"工作室\"帮助教育、激励、加速和执行客户的元宇宙目标\"。\n\n**敛财与元宇宙**\n\n\"仅仅因为你能做到，并不意味着你应该这样做，\" McInerney 说。\"你的 logo 绝对没有内在的价值，无论你有多爱它，但没有人在乎。\"她想确保百威英博别搞砸，不做任何看起来像抢钱的事情，比如推出 10000 个 NFT 并希望获得神奇的收入，她明白这种诱惑。通过设计的营销推广，几乎总是砸钱的事。它们的成本是硬性的，收益却很模糊。这就是为什么 McInerney 说，许多营销人员现在在想，\"我的天哪！我们不能成为一个成本中心！这可真是太好了！”\n\n只有一个问题，如果它看起来影响不好或贪婪，正如 McInerney 所说，\"没人会再买你的东西。\"\n\n倩碧分享了自己不敛财的经验，它是最早进军元宇宙的美妆品牌之一。倩碧没有销售 NFT ，而是让消费者在 Instagram 上分享正能量的故事（它把这个活动称为 \"MetaOptimist\"）。倩碧向获胜者赠送了 NFT 和 10 年的产品，[比如一位生病的母亲](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW_Vr_Up-b5/)，她每天都带着 \"希望和乐观 \"开始工作，她的儿子正在变得更强大，更聪明。倩碧的全球消费者参与部副总裁 Roxanne Iyer 说，活动的目标是 \"使忠诚度现代化，并推动对品牌的渗透。\"她很高兴的看到搜索量和品牌知名度飙升 20%。\n\n并非每个活动都那么成功。百事可乐的 NFT 发布时，营销部的主管们都担忧其反响。当百事可乐的 twitter 操作发布其 NFT 时，很快 Meta 就回复说：\"这在元宇宙中会很好看。\"百事可乐则回复说：\"还是你懂我，朋友！\" 正如一位品牌专家所说，\"这似乎是不真实的。Web3 对此的反应是，这只是奉承\"。\n\n其他公司还在观望，它们需要更多的数据。\" Balis 说：\"我认为这不只是风险和担忧，而更多的是未回答的问题。法律方面的考虑是什么？税收将如何处理？监管方面正在发生什么？这些都是阿迪达斯不得不解决的问题，这对一个全球品牌来说其实是很棘手的。\n\n\"我们有超过 6 万名员工，\" Wright 说。\"我们是一个庞大的集团，有非常多品牌代表。\" 比方说，阿迪达斯的欧洲足球部门的内部运作方式，可能和美国的足球部门不太一样。\n\n或者考虑一下财务问题。在欧洲，该公司使用欧元，在美国，使用美元，然后元宇宙内的交易手续费需要用代币支付。\"当然，在这种规模下和这么多国家间，情况变得相当复杂，\" Wright 说，\"它的运转一直是非常庞杂的。”\n\n当 NARS 发布“高潮”系列 NFT 时，Fierro 不得不应对各种挑战。\"它们每个都需要一个精雕细琢的生产过程，花费了相当大的时间精力，\" Fierro 说，\"坦率地讲，这需要一定程度的预算和投资，而很多品牌目前还没有分配这种预算和投资\"。\n\n然后，还有一个事实是，元宇宙的概念仍然在不断演化。\n\n\"我们没有看到全方位的公司探索不同用例的原因，是由于规模问题，\" Balis 说，她说的 \"规模 \"是指它还没有完全施展开来，它还是互相割裂的。在 Roblox 中正常的 3D 图像在 Sandbox 中可能无法辨认( Sandbox 是一款移动游戏，而不是字面意义上的沙盒）。\n\n\"有些元宇宙只能通过虚拟现实头戴设备访问“，Balis 说，\"有些元宇宙只能通过台式电脑访问。”有些只支持移动端，有些是中心化的，有些是去中心化的。这事儿得花不少时间去琢磨。\n\n对于阿迪达斯的 Wright 来说，最大的挑战仍然是整体性的对加密货币的怀疑，以及长期以来，对它所包含的许多内容的厌恶——诈骗、投机、跑路。在获得企业的支持方面， Wright 说：\"在 OpenSea 上每发生一个被骗的故事，我们就会失去 10 到 15 个客户。”\n\n从某种意义上说，这与品牌专家通常对品牌的思考方式并没有什么不同。\n\n\"我不认为关于元宇宙的品牌或广告问题与在其他地方有什么不同，\" Balis 说，我们还是问类似的问题，\"这里有我的潜在客户么？这是一个我觉得可以创造优质体验的环境吗？”\n\n其他问题：我能否以一种真实的方式将我的品牌带入生活？我可以用符合我们价值观的方式讲述我的故事吗？正如 Balis 所说，\"一些创意形式将是新的，但我不认为这些问题有什么不同。\"\n\n## 百威英博的奇特酿造\n\n在百威英博，McInerney 铿锵有力地回答了这些问题，然后她确定，是的，将啤酒带入元宇宙确实是有意义的。这最终让我们回到了核心问题上——\"在元宇宙中喝啤酒 \"到底是什么意思，这怎么会不荒唐呢？在欢乐时光，我更喜欢喝生啤，或者是瓶装，罐装也可以，但它不太可能是一张 JPEG 图片。\n\n我把我的困惑告诉了 McInerney ，她给出了一个令人信服的反驳。\n\n她说：\"我不能边喝酒边开车，但你经常看到高速公路上的广告牌，都是酒精广告。或者她会在星期二的中午收到啤酒的广告，\"而我在工作，不能喝酒\"。\n\n她的观点是，是的，虚拟啤酒可能无法与你实际饮用的冰镇饮料相媲美，但也许它比你从传统广告中得到的 \"印象 \"更好。\n\n\"我们可以做得比高速公路上的广告牌，或者比周二中午的啤酒推文广告要好得多，\"已经离开百威英博的 McInerney 说，她现在正在创办自己的聚焦 Web3 和元宇宙的公司。\"我们真的可以给那些想玩品牌的人带来惊喜和快乐。”\n\n而在未来，也许这些啤酒真的可以被饮用。McInerney 建议进行数字和实物的混合体验，也许是在观看赛马的时候。\n\n\"我的设想是，你和我将能够在两个不同的地方各自赛马。\" 她在伦敦，我在丹佛。\"我们可以登录 Zed Run 网站。我们可以选择几场比赛参加。\" 我们分享这种数字体验。我们也可能在元宇宙中去 Decentraland 的 Zed Run 酒吧。\n\n\"我会先买一轮，因为这才对嘛，\"McInerney 说。然后在 20 分钟内， Uber Eats把一瓶真实的啤酒送到我在丹佛的家门口，另一瓶真实的啤酒出现在 McInerney 在伦敦的家。\"我们可以有一个共同的'数字-实物体验'，我们在享受 Stella 啤酒的同时，进行我们的赛马比赛。”\n\n有些人可能认为这个未来是令人兴奋的。有些人则认为它是令人绝望的。但越来越多的公司将其视为完全不同的东西：这是有利可图的。\n\n\n---\n\n原文\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/08/virtual-beers-and-digital-orgasms-welcome-to-the-age-of-metaverse-commerce/](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/08/virtual-beers-and-digital-orgasms-welcome-to-the-age-of-metaverse-commerce/)\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HMdTMO0BJEsmT8JTsmDax.png?height=733&width=600)\n\n",

Media报道，韩国科技巨头Hancom旗下加密子公司Arowana Hub推出的加密项目遭遇诉讼，Arowana Coin代币投资者面临大规模亏损风险。首尔中央地方法院6日接受了对Arowana Coin投资的普通投资者的债权临时扣押申请。因此，钱包管理人Hexlant保管的Arowana基金会所有的4.3亿多枚Arowana Coin被临时扣押，在诉讼结束之前这些代币禁止移动。普通投资者索赔的损失金额为800亿韩元（约合6089万美元）。如果投资者赢了，法院最多可以将5000万枚Arowana Coin代币在不锁仓的情况下转给投资者，并允许投资者在交易所出售。\n\n此前，投资者与Hancom签订了5000万枚Arowana Coin投资合同，并支付了这笔钱。Hancom曾承诺将在2021年代币上线交易所后将这些代币转移至投资者的钱包中，但并未兑现。Arowana Coin于2021年上线Bithumb交易所后，立即暴涨超1000%。投资人声称，就算是按照Arowana Coin最低价计算，损失金额也达到了1156亿韩元（约合8799万美元）。而投资者与Hancom的代币投资合同发生纠纷，Bithumb对此未进行披露，被质疑没有对投资者采取保护措施。据悉，Arowana (ARW) 项目是一个处理黄金等实物资产价值的区块链平台，有人怀疑金Arowana Coin被用于为Hancom董事长金相哲筹集行贿资金，调查仍在进行中。Hancom公司随后对法院扣押资金一事提出异议，称申请临时扣押的投资者与Aronawa Hub没有债务关系。\n\n[英国《金融时报》推出加密金融板块](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/p80uo24n.html)\n\n据FinanceFeeds报道，英国《金融时报》推出了Cryptofinance板块，这是一个集合加密货币报道的新的数字中心和每周通讯，旨在揭示数字资产行业以及创新如何影响主流金融。\n\n[外媒：美国SEC官员回应称SEC尚未就BNB向币安发出传票](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/tu83e2yt.html)\n\n加密媒体CoinDesk根据《信息自由法》向SEC提交了一份“SEC就调查BNB代币向币安发出的传票”的请求被退回，但一位SEC官员在回复中写道：“根据你在信中提供的信息，我们对SEC的各种记录系统进行了彻底搜索，但没有找到或识别任何响应你请求的信息。”据悉，彭博社曾于6月份报道，美国SEC正在调查BNB代币是否为未注册的证券，对此赵长鹏回应币安就其产品与当局保持定期联系，并否认该公司已被传唤。\n\n[三箭资本创始人Su

Zhu还表示，他们未预料到LUNA能在几天内跌至归零，并引发整个行业的信贷紧缩，从而对三箭所有流动性不足的头寸造成巨大压力。尽管如此，该基金仍能够继续从大型数字资产贷方和富有的投资者那里借款，直到这些机构本身陷入危机。在LUNA崩盘后，Su Zhu表示贷方对三箭资本的财务状况“感到满意”，并允许他们继续交易。\n\n对于外界质疑其“奢靡”的生活，Su Zhu表示：“此前传闻的破产之际支付5000万美元首付买游艇的消息不实，那艘游艇是1年前委托建造的，并且有完整的资金来源。我每天骑自行车上下班，和我的家人在新加坡只有两个家。出问题时总有人喜欢写出这样的新闻。”在回答有关该公司哪里出了问题时，Su Zhu提到了多年牛市带来的过度自信，牛市不仅注入了他和Davies的思维力，还注入了几乎所有的行业信贷基础设施，在这些领域，因为有像他这样的融资公司，贷方看到了他们的价值膨胀。\n\n[BlockFi第二季度透明度报告：有18亿美元未偿贷款，已制定流动性指导方案](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/h1584h4x.html)\n\n据Cointelegraph报道，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，截至第二季度末，公司拥有来自机构和散户投资者的18亿美元未偿贷款，其中6亿美元是无抵押贷款。机构贷款占未偿贷款总额的15亿美元，而散户贷款占剩余的3亿美元。\n\nBlockFi表示已经制定指导方案，以帮助其保持必要的流动性来履行核心业务活动，包括机构和零售借贷和交易活动。该指导方案将根据客户的需求在库存中持有至少10%的总金额，并准备好退还给客户。还将在可在7天内收回并返还给客户的地方持有至少50%的欠款，并将根据需要将欠客户总额的至少90%用于存货或可偿还的贷款中。这类贷款将在一年内召回。\n\n[Coinbase发布二季度投资备忘录，Web

{"id": "q-NWUpOWJVUkw11CO6XwB-Fj_aBBmra5esp9uqOciAw", "title": "How Web3 Is Transforming the Gaming Industry", "body": "原文链接：[How Web3 Is Transforming the Gaming Industry](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/how-web3-is-transforming-the-gaming-industry/)\n\n[https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/how-web3-is-transforming-the-gaming-industry/](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/how-web3-is-transforming-the-gaming-industry/)\n\nWe are seeing growth in independent gaming studios utilizing web3\n\n我们看到独立游戏工作室利用 Web3 收获的增长。\n\nWeb3，作为一个概念，只有不到十年的历史，但它作为一个技术发展的框架已经开始流行。Web3 在游戏中找到了它最有反应能力的受众和开发者群体，而游戏本身就是一个增长型产业。但是，Web3 去中心化的游戏方法在游戏创作和区块链技术的交汇处特别活跃。\n\nOne of the signs of a gaming revival is the growth in independent gaming studios. In 2022, game building is extremely active: as many as [25 new games](https://techjury.net/blog/video-games-industry-statistics/#gref) appear on Steam each day. There are more than 2,500 US-based game studios, but game development is no longer regionally restricted and in the hands of a few gaming giants. Instead, there is a variety of creative teams, taking up multiple avenues of development.\n\n游戏复兴的标志之一是独立游戏工作室的增长。在2022年，游戏建设极为活跃：每天有多达25个新游戏出现在 Steam 上。美国有2500多家游戏工作室，但游戏开发不再受地区限制，不再掌握在少数游戏巨头手中。相反，有各种各样的创意团队，占据了多种开发途径。\n\n## Web3: Create a Sandbox Experience\n\nThe concept of Web3 brings user-generated content to gaming. Modding, for instance, proved especially successful for creators and highly appealing for players. Novelty demand and building on the common game framework of Minecraft was a huge success for Microsoft. [Minecraft modding](https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-modders-have-sold-a-billion-mods-for-more-than-dollar350m-since-microsoft-bought-it/) led to a billion official downloads and $350M in additional income since 2017. Then, there is the free, open-source modding through informal channels.\n\nWeb3 的概念为游戏带来了用户生成的内容。例如，游戏改装(Modding)被证明对创作者特别成功，对玩家也有很大吸引力。新奇的需求和建立在《Minecraft》的共同游戏框架上，对微软来说是巨大的成功。自2017年以来，《Minecraft》的 MOD 导致了10亿次官方下载和3.5亿美元的额外收入。然后，还有通过非正式渠道的免费、开源的修改。\n\n[Web3](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/web3/) expands the appeal of making your own world and actually owning it. This concept is already built into several metaverse games on the blockchain, which focus on providing building opportunities and then lets their players create unscripted unique digital 3D venues. The model was successful for top metaverse games like Decentraland, The Sandbox and other simulated worlds.\n\nWeb3 扩大了制造你自己的世界并实际拥有它的吸引力。这个概念已经内置于区块链上的几个元老级游戏中，这些游戏专注于提供建设机会，然后让他们的玩家创造无脚本的独特数字3D场所。这种模式对于像 Decentraland, The Sandbox 和其他模拟世界这样的顶级元空间游戏是成功的。\n\nWeb3 world-building is free creation open to almost anyone with the right skills, with no limit to potential earnings and fame. In traditional gaming, the studio would reap all the praise and income, which Web3 now releases to a whole new scene of creators.\n\nWeb3 的世界建设是免费的创作，几乎对任何有适当技能的人开放，对潜在的收入和名声没有限制。在传统的游戏中，工作室将获得所有的赞誉和收入，而 Web3 现在向一个全新的创造者场景发布。\n\nAlexis Ohanian, the Co-Founder and Director of Reddit and serial Internet entrepreneur, has noted the value hidden in incipient Web3 projects. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mY7C4PKsCI&ab_channel=BloombergTechnology), Ohanian explained the growth of Web2 was about content – the so-called read and write part of the Internet. “All that Web3 jargon we see, it’s about the third part, ownership.” Ohanian sees gaming and NFTs as the beginnings of infrastructure that will have tremendous implications down the line.\n\nReddit 的联合创始人兼董事、连续的互联网企业家 Alexis Ohanian 注意到了隐藏在新生的Web3 项目中的价值。在最近的一次采访中，Ohanian 解释说，Web2 的增长是关于内容的——互联网的所谓读写部分。\"我们看到的所有 Web3 的行话，都是关于第三部分，即所有权。\" Ohanian 认为游戏和 NFTs 是基础设施的开端，将在未来产生巨大的影响。\n\n## Web3: The Key to Value Ownership\n\nOne of the concepts of Web3 is owning your own resources and value. In gaming, there are many ways in which the player can create a scarce resource. World creation and [metaverse land plots](https://play2moon.com/metaverse-land-101-starting-out-with-digital-nft-plots/), crafting, equipment upgrades or characters leveling up, are all that can be reflected in decentralized records. Even the time spent playing the game can be added to the balance of each individual player.\n\nWeb3 的概念之一是拥有自己的资源和价值。在游戏中，玩家有很多方法可以创造稀缺资源。世界的创造和元气的地块(metaverse land plots)，手工制作，装备升级或人物等级提升，都可以体现在去中心化的记录中。甚至玩游戏的时间也可以加到每个玩家的余额中。\n\nGaming already produces a seemingly limitless inflow of [hours spent](https://steamcharts.com/) on perfecting one’s progress. Take Elden Ring, a recent hit – almost half a million players were spending hundreds of thousands of hours exploring the game and testing out strategies.\n\n游戏已经产生了一个看似无限的流入，花在完善一个人的进步上的时间。以最近的热门游戏《艾尔登环》为例——几乎有50万玩家花了数十万小时探索游戏和测试策略。\n\n[Gaming activity](https://www.limelight.com/lp/state-of-online-gaming-2021/) increased by 14% in 2021, a recent survey reveals. Players on average spend more than eight hours and 27 minutes on games per week. Some of the gamers tried to monetize their gameplay through Web2 channels and social media, with over [8.8 billion hours of streamed games](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1125469/video-game-stream-hours-watched/#:\\~:text=Video%20game%20live%20streaming%20hours%20watched%202019%2D2021&text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,billion%20hours%20two%20years%20previously.) which are watched over the course of a year.\n\n一项调查显示，游戏活动在2021年增加了14%。玩家平均每周在游戏上花费超过8小时27分钟。一些游戏玩家试图通过Web2渠道和社交媒体来实现游戏的货币化，一年中，有超过88亿小时的流媒体游戏被观看。\n\nBut, there are many more ways to extract the value of gaming and track one’s progress. The blockchain is the perfect tool to wrap up game achievements, so they cannot be erased or modified. Players need not become streamers in order to monetize the hours played. Rather, they can tokenize them on the blockchain, with several powerful tools to turn their gaming progress into an asset. The potential for tokenization has spread to many types of games, including simulated sports, puzzles or even chess tournaments with NFT and tokens.\n\n但是，还有很多方法可以提取游戏的价值并跟踪一个人的进展。区块链是打包游戏成就的完美工具，区块链让游戏成就不能被抹去或修改。玩家不需要为了使游戏时间货币化而成为流作家。相反，他们可以在区块链上将其代币化，用几个强大的工具将他们的游戏进展变成一种资产。代币化的潜力已经扩散到许多类型的游戏，包括模拟体育、拼图甚至是用NFT和代币进行的国际象棋比赛。\n\n## What Are the Tools for Web3 Gaming in 2022\n\nWeb3 is no longer just vaporware but offers sufficient tools to take your value and achievements with you. Lightweight cryptocurrency wallets can now connect to the app you use, and almost seamlessly increase your balance in exchange for your regular digital activities. The infrastructure is already there: blockchains run 24/7, and smart contracts can listen for events and distribute value.\n\nWeb3 不再只是蒸发器，而是提供足够的工具，让你的价值和成就与你同行。轻量级的加密货币钱包现在可以连接到你使用的应用程序，并几乎无缝地增加你的余额，以换取你的常规数字活动。基础设施已经存在：区块链24/7运行，智能合约可以监听事件并分配价值。\n\nA blockchain can compensate users in two major ways. One, by paying out tokens, which will work like digital money and give a certain value to the gameplay. And two, by creating unique NFT items shaped by game experience. For instance, the hours spent upgrading your game hero with equipment, enchantments, skills, or other items can be translated into a rare or unique non-fungible token (NFT), which can then be resold or kept as a store of value.\n\n区块链可以通过两种主要方式对用户进行补偿。其一，通过支付代币，这将像数字货币一样工作，并赋予游戏的一定价值。第二，通过创造由游戏经验塑造的独特NFT项目。例如，用装备、魔法、技能或其他物品升级你的游戏英雄所花费的时间，可以转化为稀有或独特的不可伪造的代币（NFT），然后可以出售或保留作为价值储存。\n\n## What Is the Problem with the Play-to-Earn Model\n\nGame and blockchain developers already had all the tools to turn a user into a point of value generation. This translated into the simple idea of getting paid for gaming. For a few months, the model looked very promising and sparked great enthusiasm, especially for the Axie Infinity game. At one point, playing Axies could produce a reasonably high monthly income, leading to a gold rush.\n\n游戏和区块链开发者已经有了所有的工具，可以把用户变成一个价值产生点。这转化为通过游戏获得报酬的简单想法。几个月来，这个模式看起来非常有前途，并引发了巨大的热情，比如说 Axie Infinity。一时间，玩 Axies 可以产生相当高的月收入，导致了淘金热。\n\nA few problems immediately arose from this. Players were paid in crypto tokens, and to spend the funds, they had to convert the tokens to fiat. But, all the selling depressed the token price and destroyed the intended economic model.\n\n由此立即产生了一些问题。玩家是以加密代币支付的，为了花掉这些资金，他们必须将代币转换成法币。但是，所有的销售都压低了代币价格，破坏了预期的经济模式。\n\nThe second problem is that traditional gamers are sometimes averse to using [crypto](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/crypto/) assets. Even in the best-case scenario, they can have a steep learning curve to get on board cryptocurrency usage. So, projects have to be proactive about their user cultivation process, instead of setting up their potential clients on a rather complicated path of learning crypto first and then come back for the game. Projects like [EVOS.gg](https://evos.gg/) already have a form of seamless onboarding, with an exclusive wallet set up for the gamer to accrue any tokens and NFT prizes. There is no need to visit a crypto exchange, understand networks and fees, or buy anything in advance.\n\n第二个问题是，传统的游戏玩家有时对使用加密货币资产感到厌恶。即使在最好的情况下，他们也会有一个陡峭的学习曲线来加入加密货币的使用。因此，项目必须积极主动地培养用户，而不是让他们的潜在客户走上一条相当复杂的道路，先学习加密货币，然后再回来玩游戏。像EVOS.gg 这样的项目已经有了一种无缝上岗的形式，为游戏者设置了一个专属的钱包来累积任何代币和NFT奖品。不需要访问加密货币交易所，了解网络和费用，或提前购买任何东西。\n\nBut, the most important thing to avoid is to copy a model where players strip-mine the game of value, and they play just to grind out as many tokens as possible. This is not viable for the game, and we have many examples where the P2E model is already depleted, while the game team is just starting out to improve their product. The goal of Web3 should be to add value, and not to extract all value from a game until it is no longer fun to play.\n\n但是，最重要的是要避免复制一种模式，即玩家对游戏的价值进行剥离式开采，他们玩的目的只是为了尽可能多地赚取代币。这对游戏来说是不可行的，我们有很多例子，表明 P2E 模式已经被耗尽，而游戏团队刚刚开始改进他们的产品。Web3 的目标应该是增加价值，而不是从一个游戏中提取所有的价值，直到它不再有乐趣。\n\n## Web3 and Voting: What the DAO Changes for Gamers\n\nWeb3 can create a whole new type of community. Let’s speak of the [DAO](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/dao/), or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. This is where the community can decide for itself where the project is going. There are already multiple examples of successful DAO where asset owners can vote and direct the project.\n\nWeb3 可以创造一种全新的社区类型。让我们说说DAO，即分散的自治组织。这就是社区可以自己决定项目的走向。已经有多个成功的DAO的例子，资产所有者可以投票并指导项目。\n\nThis is a new form of governance, replacing the opaque decision-making process of the corporation with a technological hub where each decision is visible and accessible to the whole community. The access point to this structure is, again, ownership. So, it’s double participation, once by owning a piece of the project, and again when having the right to decide on its future.\n\n这是一种新的治理形式，用一个技术中心取代了公司不透明的决策过程，在这个技术中心，每一个决定都是可见的，并且可以被整个社区访问。这个结构的接入点，依然是，所有权。因此，这是双重参与，一次是拥有项目的一部分，另一次是有权决定项目的未来。\n\nBlockchain voting somewhat resembles shareholder rights, though DAO is even more democratized, with almost no geographical limitations to ownership. And of course, shareholder votes do not happen on the blockchain and need human intermediaries. All a DAO needs is a well-built collection of smart contracts, where the code is entirely transparent and predictable.\n\n区块链投票有点类似于股东权利，尽管DAO的民主化程度更高，对所有权几乎没有地域限制。当然，股东投票也不会发生在区块链上，需要人类中介。DAO所需要的是一个精心构建的智能合约集合，其中的代码是完全透明和可预测的。\n\nDAO is where the question of personal participation is answered. One of the critical points for Web3 is the need to buy assets, often high-priced, with no real game in production. This has been very worrisome for Web3 investors, and it is true that some of the projects collected funds and proved to be nothing more than a money-grabbing operation. But, others offered the advantage of early access, and then went on to build a complex, stunning hub of value and entertainment. The early investors were justly rewarded for their foresight and patience and, of course, for taking an asymmetric risk with a high reward potential.\n\nDAO 是回答个人参与问题的地方。Web3 的关键点之一是需要购买资产，往往是高价的，没有真正的游戏在生产。这让 Web3 的投资者非常担心，确实有一些项目收集了资金，并被证明只不过是一种圈钱的行为。但是，其他项目提供了早期访问的优势，然后继续建立一个复杂的、令人惊叹的价值和娱乐的中心。早期投资者因其远见和耐心得到了合理的回报，当然，他们也承担了具有高回报潜力的不对称风险。\n\nIt is not always necessary to have an overpriced [NFT](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/nfts/) to participate in a DAO. Sometimes, token ownership is enough. But, it raises an interesting issue, in Web3, each user has some skin in the game. Part of the curation and decision-making process hinges on dedicated fans, who are willing to offer value upfront and build their own little corner of Web3, whether it is a DAO, a metaverse location or a game economy.\n\n参加 DAO 并不总是需要拥有高价的NFT。有时，代币所有权就足够了。但是，这提出了一个有趣的问题，在 Web3 中，每个用户在游戏中都有一些皮肤。策划和决策过程的一部分取决于热心的粉丝，他们愿意预先提供价值，并建立他们自己的 Web3 的小角落，无论是 DAO、元宇宙空间位置还是游戏经济。\n\nWhen players produce NFT or tokens based on their gameplay, they can also show loyalty by staking or voting. In Web3 games, they will not only be game consumers but have partial ownership of the game.\n\n当玩家通过他们的游戏产生NFT或代币时，他们也可以通过押注或投票来显示忠诚度。在 Web3 游戏中，他们不仅是游戏消费者，而且对游戏有部分所有权。\n\n## Do Players Really Need to But In to Use Web3?\n\nMany projects try to build themselves up as an exclusive club, requiring a significant buy-in. And for some, it worked to create a sense of exclusivity in an over-saturated information market. But there are ways to use Web3 features without requiring a big upfront investment.\n\n许多项目试图把自己打造成一个独家俱乐部，需要大量的买入。而对某些人来说，这在过度饱和的信息市场中创造了一种排他性的感觉。但是，有一些方法可以在不需要大量前期投资的情况下使用 Web3 的功能。\n\nPlayers can start achieving and building while having fun. And after that, they can wrap up the content and own it, upgrade and resell if they want. Games don't need to optimize for token operations and value, but they may become a play-to-earn combination, which takes the full gaming experience and turns it into NFTs, short term rewards and long-term voting rights.\n\n玩家可以在享受乐趣的同时开始实现和建设。而在这之后，他们可以把内容打包起来（译注：即打包成 NFT），并拥有它，如果他们愿意，可以升级和转售。游戏不需要为代币运营和价值进行优化，但它们可能会成为从玩到赚的组合，这需要完整的游戏体验并将其转化为NFT、短期奖励和长期投票权。\n\nProjects like Bored Ape Yacht Club added a 'cool' dimension to the large upfront investment. BAYC avatars trading for more than 100 ETH are one of the more influential crypto societies. ApeCoin (APE) also boosted the NFT collection's influence, tying it all together with a metaverse-based game.\n\n像 Bored Ape 游艇俱乐部这样的项目为大量的前期投资增加了一个 \"酷 \"的层面。交易价格超过 100ETH 的 BAYC 化身是更有影响力的加密货币社团之一。APE 也提升了NFT系列的影响力，将其与一个基于元数据的游戏联系在一起。\n\nIt is also possible to take a game-first approach, with the value coming in as a logical extension of the game. No need to build up hype, all games have the capacity to build a dedicated community, which can then become empowered to use Web 3 elements. The blockchain gaming space has all the right tools, so it can onboard gamers that are not crypto-savvy, or are even somewhat crypto-averse.\n\n也可以采取游戏优先的方法，将价值作为游戏的逻辑延伸。不需要炒作，所有的游戏都有能力建立一个专门的社区，然后可以授权给他们使用 Web3 元素。区块链游戏领域拥有所有正确的工具，因此它可以接纳不懂加密货币的游戏者，甚至有点不喜欢加密货币的人。\n\nAnd, while Web3 may be the future, it is highly important to have a positive onboarding experience for as many users as possible. This is the only way that users will not be overwhelmed by terminology or find the project meaningless. Our approach is to build a fun game with a rewarding progress potential, and then offer the opportunity to wrap up that progress and participate in the larger Web3 ecosystem.\n\n而且，虽然 Web3 可能是未来的趋势，但对尽可能多的用户来说，有一个积极的上手体验是非常重要的。只有这样，用户才不会被术语所淹没，或者觉得这个项目毫无意义。推荐的方法是建立一个有趣的游戏，具有奖励性的进展潜力，然后提供机会来总结这个进展并参与更大的Web3 生态系统。", "timestamp": 1658546959, "digest": "t4GwbU54a789F1c5y0wbeFIgVxcCKtq7aaQY5VpyWN8", "contributor": "0x2a704f87CB047691139c6fEC103ffbb10F9C67a2"}
{"id": "XW5nZsINWFEICpMAKmN6AjoKR5fnQaE4jYaCYgrEwDA", "title": "BTC Hashrate Down by 26% in 30 Days: When Will the Crypto Bear End?", "body": "After the BTC hashrate hit a record high of 266.41EH/s on June 8, people thought that the vitality injected by miners, who run the crypto upstream, could save cryptocurrency from the prolonged slump and lead to market recovery. Yet, as central banks around the world raised interest rates to combat the soaring inflation, financial markets in many countries suffered panic-driven dumping. Affected by such external forces and macro policies, crypto finance has struggled to stay intact.\n\nData from CoinGecko shows that the total market cap of cryptocurrency has fallen below $1 trillion, a loss of nearly $2 trillion from its peak in November last year. In particular, the price of Bitcoin, as called “digital gold”, has plunged by over 70% from its peak in November 2021 and is now quoted at $19,721. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BNB, and ADA have all dropped by more than 60% since last year.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nCLIDna2XX72RGVZSb1jk.png?height=775&width=1400)\n\nThe continued price decline has also slashed the profit margins of crypto miners. Meanwhile, a growing number of medium-level mining rigs are approaching the shutdown price. Data from ViaBTC shows that assuming electricity costs $0.06 per kWh, according to the current BTC price, mining rigs such as Antminer S15, Whatsminer M21S, and other models have fallen below the shutdown price. From June 8 to July 11, the BTC hashrate had dropped by 26%.\n\nOn the one hand, miners have to pay for the normal expenses of running mining rigs; on the other hand, they are uncertain about the market trend in the second half of 2022. As such, BTC miners are no longer holding all their coins. According to Glassnode, the reserve balance of BTC miners has fallen to 1,819,038 BTC, a 7-month low. This is also the bottom point this year, which means that miners have been selling their BTC holdings.\n\n# When will the crypto bear end?\n\nThe MLIV Pulse Survey, which included 950 investors, shows that 60% of the respondents believe that the BTC price is more likely to fall to $10,000 sooner than it climbs to $30,000, and only 40% of the respondents felt differently. In terms of the external factors, many Fed officials have released “hawkish” signals. According to the latest news from CME’s Federal Reserve Watch, the probability of the Fed raising interest rates by 75 basis points in July is 90.6%.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VwNfS5ujXmR0aicK1fPZ2.png?height=720&width=1277)\n\nWe can tell that most investors are pessimistic about the market prospect of cryptocurrency. Signals such as miners selling their cryptos and the Fed hiking interest rates indicate that cryptos that are closely correlated with the U.S. stocks, especially the NASDAQ index, may suffer further price drops.\n\nHowever, according to the historical patterns recorded during past bear-bull cycles, “miners’ surrender” is a typical sign of a bottom. For example, Bitcoin bottomed out in 2018 when it fell below a key mining cost indicator. The price hit bottom again in late 2019 when Bitcoin plunged below the indicator. In March 2020, Bitcoin hit the mining cost for the third time and then began to rebound. Moreover, the price even reached its historical peak in 2021.\n\nMike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, tweeted that the BTC price may rebound this year as the market shows signs similar to the 2018 bottom. According to Yassine Elmandjra, a crypto analyst at ARK Investment Management, Bitcoin has traded below its 200 WMA and short-and long-term cost bases for only the fourth time in price history, levels that have historically marked generational bottoms.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CuTKcCQKtqBmoFr25VroM.png?height=863&width=720)\n\nLooking at financial markets worldwide, we notice that bears are generally shorter than bulls. According to a recent report from CNBC, the average length of a bear market is 289 days; bull markets, on the other hand, average 991 days. Therefore, even if Bitcoin is going through the toughest period ever, Bitcoin has survived tenaciously every time, as evidenced by its past performance. We are thus confident that it will stick through the current bear market as well. Therefore, crypto investors don’t have to get overwrought as they face the present market sluggishness.\n\nFind us here:\nWebsite ▶️ <https://www.coinex.com>\nTwitter ▶️ <https://twitter.com/coinexcom/>\nTelegram ▶️ <https://t.me/CoinExOfficialEN>\nMedium ▶️ <https://medium.com/@coinex>\nReddit ▶️ <https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinEx/>\nFacebook ▶️ <https://www.facebook.com/thecoinex/>\nInstagram ▶️ <https://www.instagram.com/coinexcom/>", "timestamp": 1658546897, "digest": "ApssPxtmvS9_pXYKDVlzzdc7yBtpjYJEO5R2Ij0-R5c", "contributor": "0xD5806ddb5249d34D389aB4D4a042AD24e05cef39"}

Such an access control model can protect users against snooping and protect the stability and security of the operating system \\[31\\]. When an Android app attempts to access the restricted resources, a security check is triggered to inspect whether proper permissions are granted. Lack of permission request will prevent access to the resource and further cease the corresponding function-ality or even crash the app. Therefore, it is essential for developers to know the permissions required of the invoked API. Unnecessary required permissions can pose three threats: (i) Too many required permissions may confuse users. Users suspect that the app hasunexpected behaviors, which leads to users uninstalling or unwilling to install the app; (*ii*) The permissions required by an app is an important feature in detecting Android malware. Unnecessary permissions will fool the detector and cause a false alarm; (*iii*) The app will incur security risks with unnecessary permissions. Once the app contains vulnerabilities that can be injected with tampered code, it is easy for an attacker to thwart user privacy or invoke sensitive APIs. Moreover, requesting unnecessary permissions may expand the attack surface and expose the Android operating system to a host of attacks, especially privilege escalation attacks \\[17\\].Therefore, to safeguard users’ privacy and protect the Android ecosystem, Android app developers are suggested to follow the principle of *least privilege*, *i.e.*, requesting a minimum set of permissions required to fulfill the apps’ functionality. Unfortunately, Android does not provide official documentation for the permission specifications (*i.e.*, a mapping between APIs and the required permissions), making it difficult for app developers to follow the least privilege rule, and further lead to security vulnerabilities such as permission over-privilege \\[17\\]. To address this problem, researchers have been working on developing methods that generate an accurate list, called a protection map, that maps Android APIs to the required permissions. The previous works that provide such protection maps include Stowaway \\[17\\], PScout \\[12\\], Axplorer \\[13\\], Arcade \\[9\\], PSGen \\[39\\], and most recently, Dynamo \\[14\\]. Stowaway empirically determines the permissions required in Android APIs using feedback-directed testing. PScout and Axplorer leverage control-flow reachability analysis on the source code of the Android framework to generate the mapping between APIs and permissions. Arcade proposes a path-sensitive method based on graph abstraction techniques to generate a more precise mapping. PSGen statically generatesthe protection map for Android NDK. Dynamo extracts the protection mapping through dynamic test. Dynamic testing methods (*e.g.*, Stowaway and Dynamo) can accurately map the required permissions to API invocations that they have tested; however, such dynamic approaches suffer from an intrinsic shortcoming of low coverage. The existing static analysis based approaches (*e.g.*, PScout, Axplorer, and Arcade) have better coverage but may lead to imprecise results because of improper modeling of the complicated Android communication mechanisms. PSGen extracts protection mapping for Android NDK (*i.e.*, both protected APIs and permission checks are in the Native code), which has a different scope to our approach (*i.e.*, the protected APIs are in the Java framework, while the permission checks are in the Native code).\n\nSpecifically, existing works only analyzed the Java API framework in the *Android API Framework*, but overlooked the *C/C++ Native Library* that consists of core Android system components and services (*e.g.*, Camera service, Sensor service). For example, the public method openCamera() in CameraManager.java class implements its permission check (“android.permission.CAMERA”) in the native library CameraService.cpp. Missing native library analysis will mistakenly conclude that the API openCamera() does not require any permissions (one example is detailed in Section 2). While the API-permission protection mapping contributes to identifying security vulnerabilities in Android apps, such as permission *over-privilege* \\[17\\] (*i.e.*, an app requests additional permissions that are not required), the imprecise mapping will lead to false results on detecting such vulnerabilities. Taking the aforementioned case as an example, an app invokes the API openCamera() will need to request the corresponding permission android.permission.CAMERA; however, existing works that do not analyze the native libraries will identify it as a permission overprivilege case, and henceforce, a false positive. Static analysis is widely used in code analysis due to its fast speed and high code coverage, especially in the field of Android security analysis \\[11, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 32, 38\\]. There are also many works on vulnerability identification of Android operation systems \\[10, 15, 16, 23, 25, 28–30, 33, 35\\]. In this research, to address the shortcomings of the existing works, we leverage the cross-language analysis on the overall Android system, including both the *Java API Framework* and the *C/C++ Native Libraries*. To this end, we analyze the cross-language communication mechanisms on five Android Open Source Projects (AOSP) and summarize two communication models to facilitate the cross-language analysis. We develop a prototype system, NatiDroid, and generate Native-triggered (*i.e.*, an Android API whose permission check is implemented in the native library) API-permission mappings in AOSP versions 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, and 10.0, which were chosen to benchmark against prior works \\[9, 13\\] (see detailed discussion in Section 5). In addition to the mappings generated by previous works, Axplorer and Arcade (2,115 and 1,585, respectively, in AOSP 7.0), NatiDroid can successfully discover 449 mappings that are not covered previously. \n\nNote that while most Android APIs are Java methods, fewer of them are C/C++ methods. Nevertheless, these native methods play indispensable roles in the Android system, such as interacting with the hardware layer. We further use the new mappings to detect permission over-privilege vulnerabilities on a large dataset containing more than 11,000 Android apps, including system apps from custom Android ROMs and third-party apps from the Google Play. We identify the worst-case scenario, where approximately 71% apps with permission over-privilege detected by Axplorer and Arcade are false positives. In summary, we make the following contributions:\n\n• We design and implement a prototype system, NatiDroid, to\n\nfacilitate cross-language control-flow analysis on the Android\n\nframework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the *first* work\n\nto enable cross-language analysis on the Android framework.\n\nBy incorporating NatiDroid with existing Java-side permission\n\nmappings (*e.g.*, Axplorer or Arcade), we obtain a complete per\u0002\n\nmission mapping that covers the entire Android system. We make\n\nour system and results publicly available to benefit researchers\n\nand practitioners.1\n\n• We apply NatiDroid to extract the permission-API protection mappings from the native libraries on four AOSP versions (7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, and 10.0). We show that 12 permissions, including 8 signature and 2 dangerous permissions, are determined to be enforced in native libraries, which are not covered by two state of-the-practice benchmarks, Axplorer and Arcade.\n\n• We analyze Android apps for permission over-privilege. Our results show that NatiDroid is effective in identifying vulnerable Android apps. We have identified approximately 71% false positives in terms of the number of the apps with at least one permission over-privileged. \n\nWe hope that the proposed system, NatiDroid in this paper could bridge the gap between Java- and Native-sides analysis (see Figure 1), rendering the static analysis of the overall Android framework to be complete and accurate.\n\n2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION\n\nThis section provides background information on how Android OS operates and explains the limitations of the existing static API protection mapping generation techniques that motivate our work. Android framework. Android framework consists of the *Java API Framework* layer and *C/C++ Native Library* layer (*i.e.*, the second and the third layers from the top in Figure 1). The *Java API Framework* layer offers Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) written in the Java language for Android app developers to access Android features and functionalities. The Java framework access the device hardware capabilities, such as the camera and sensors, via the *C/C++ Native Library* layer. When a Java framework API (*e.g.*, the Camera Manager in Figure 1) invokes a call to access device hardware, the Android system loads corresponding library module (*e.g.*, the Camera Service) for that hardware component.\n\nAndroid permission model. When an app needs to use any of the protected features of an Android device (*e.g.*, accessing the camera, sending an SMS, making a phone call), it must obtain the appropriate permission(s) from the user. When an Android API is called, the Android framework checks whether it is protected by any permission. Most of such permission checks are defined in the *Java API Framework* layer in the Android system, while there are yet a number of them defined in the *C/C++ Native Library* layer. \n\nExisting works \\[9, 12, 13\\] leverage static analysis on the *Java API Framework* layer of the Android framework to extract the mapping between APIs and corresponding permission checks. Ignoring the invocation of native libraries miss the permission checks in the native libraries, leading to incomplete mapping results.\n\n![Figure 2: Motivation example derived from a real-world Android app vStudio.Android.Camera360. The code is simplified for better illustration.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RFfRLB5Tk348sNTNuwnGI.png?height=727&width=511)\n\nMotivating example. We further elaborate on our motivation with a real-world example illustrated in Figure 2. The code from lines 1 to 10 is derived from a popular photography app vStudio.Android.Camera360 \\[8\\] on Google Play. The app initialises a CameraManager instance (line 4), and opens the camera instance by invoking openCamera() method (line 8). The invocation chain then traverses along the call path through an Android SDK class CameraManager.java (lines 11 to 18) and a native library CameraService.cpp (lines 19 to 32), and finally triggers a permission check in the native library (line 28). Note that the cameraService.connectDevice() (line 18) communicates with the CameraService::connectDevice() (line 20) in a cross-language way (marked as purple). The security check examines if the method is called by its own process (*i.e.*, cameraservice, hence, no permission is required) or the corresponding permission android.permission.CAMERA is granted. If neither it is called from its own process, nor the android.permission.CAMERA permission is granted, a permission denied error is returned (line 30), which will further prevent openCamera() to be executed. This example implies a protection mapping from the Android API, CameraManager.openCamera(), to itspermission protection check, {android.permission.CAMERA || callingPid == getpid()}.2\n\nUnfortunately, as existing works only analyzed the Java source code in the Android framework, they miss the permission checks implemented in the native libraries. For instance, the mapping of the API CameraManager.openCamera() to the permission android.permission.CAMERA, as shown in the example, does not exist in the state-of-the-practice works, such as PScout \\[12\\], Axplorer \\[13\\], or Arcade \\[9\\]. The incompleteness of the mapping results further introduces false results in detecting security vulnerabilities, such as permission over-privilege \\[17\\] (detailed in Section 4.3)\n\n3 APPROACH\n\nWe propose and implement a prototype system, NatiDroid, to address the cross-language protection mapping problem that has long been overlooked in previous works. Figure 3 illustrates the overall design of NatiDroid. As depicted, NatiDroid contains three modules. The *Pre-processing* module prepares the intermediate artifacts for analyzing the Android framework and native libraries, such as intermediate .jar files (for Java-side analysis) and Clang compile commands (for Native-side analysis). The *Entry-points identification* module summarizes two cross-language communication models used in the Android framework, and identifies the entry-points for both Java- and Native-sides analysis. The *Cross-language Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis* module constructs the cross-language CFG and extracts the permission mapping.\n\nWe propose a complete solution for extracting Native-triggered permission mapping from the Android system. We leverage Soot \\[1\\] and Clang \\[2\\] static analysis frameworks, although our solution is also applicable to other static analysis frameworks. Soot is a popular Java optimization framework for analyzing and visualizing Java and Android apps, which has been widely used in various projects for static analysis \\[12, 18, 19\\]. Clang is a lightweight compiler for C language family. We use Clang to transform C/C++ code to the Abstract syntax tree (AST) \\[3\\]. Additional code for implementing NatiDroid consists of approximately 7kLOC. We detail the design and implementation of each module in the following subsections.\n\n3\\.1 Pre-processing\n\nDue to the complexity and cross-language nature of the Android framework, there is no off-the-shelf tool for static analysis of the Android framework (*i.e.*, *Java API Framework* and *Native Library*) as a whole. NatiDroid leverages the *divide-and-conquer* strategy to facilitate the Java- and Native-sides analysis. However, there are still non-trivial tasks to prepare the AOSP codebase for the static analysis. Hence, in this module, we prepare the intermediate artifacts from the AOSP codebase, which are required to enable the Java- and Native-sides analysis. Note that the pre-processing module includes most engineering works, which is not considered our technical contribution. However, it is essential to facilitate the proposed cross-language analysis.\n\n![\nFigure 3: An overview of NatiDroid system\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4MIJk1yb0zMz2w-UXK5ec.png?height=365&width=1087)\n\nJava-side analysis preparation. NatiDroid’s Java-side analysis takes compiled .jar file as input. However, to maintain the stability of the Android system, some non-SDK class and method bodies are hidden using the @hidden Javadoc tag (*e.g.*, non-SDK Android APIs that may be changed in the future versions without noticing the app developer) during the building of android.jar from source code. The hidden classes and methods only expose the method name, parameters, return values, and minimum set of statements required to handle the invocation, which is not sufficient for constructing a complete CFG. We therefore retain the intermediate output during the compilation, *i.e.*, the intermediate .jar files that have not been combined as android.jar. These intermediate .jar files, such as services.com.intermediates.jar, have the complete class and method information sufficient for facilitating static analysis.\n\nNative-side analysis preparation. Before we build the crosslanguage CFG (cf. Section 3.3), we leverage Clang to transform C/C++ source code to AST. A complete set of Clang compile command is required to enable the static analysis, however, is not provided in Android documentation. Android uses the ninja to build system \\[6\\]. During the compilation process, the .ninja files containing ninja build commands are generated by the compiler.\n\nHowever, the commands obtained from .ninja files consist of file operations and a mixture of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and Clang commands, which are not compatible with the off-the-shelf Clang-based analyzer. We then develop a system (to 500 LOC) to extract and pre-process the required commands from these files. The functions of the system include merging separated ninja commands and replacing the Clang++ commands with Clang commands (*i.e.*, adding C++ headers in Clang command’s parameters).\n\n3\\.2 Entry-Points Identification\n\nRecall that the overall idea of generating a protection mapping is to examine whether the invocation of an API will trigger a permission check in the Android framework (*i.e.*, if there is a permission check node in the CFG starting from the API call). Due to the complexity of the Android framework, building a CFG of the overall framework is neither practical nor efficient. As NatiDroid’s goal is to complement the existing mappings, such as Axplorer and Arcade, by adding the protections whose permission checks are located in the native libraries, we only generate sub-CFGs for the Android APIs that involve cross-language communication. The first step to generate sub-CFGs is to identify the entry-points of the graphs (for both Java- and Native-sides). To this end, we first summarize two cross-language communication mechanisms used by Android.\n\n![\nFigure 4: AIDL communication model. The Java-side caller invokes remote method from Native-side.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TmQrkwSt5j7Io92h32gxu.png?height=218&width=521)\n\nAIDL-based communication model. The Android operating system (OS) is based on Linux but does not inherit the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism of Linux. In Android, resources between processes are not shared. Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) is one of the IPC mechanisms that Android adopted to enable communication for remote invocation, providing crossprocess or even cross-language communication. Figure 4 depicts the workflow of AIDL-based client-service model, where the Java framework works as a client requesting service from the native library. AIDL utilizes a pair of Stub/Proxy classes on Java-side to communicate with native libraries. The Proxy is responsible for sending requests to native service and implementing the remote method which invokes the transact() method and communicates with Native-side, while the Stub class, inheriting the Binder class, transforms service Binder and receives the reply from native service using the method onTransact(). The transact() and on Transact() are synchronous, such that a call to transact() does not return until the target has returned from onTransact().\n\nOn Native-side, it is unnecessary to generate Stub/Proxy pairs, but directly implements the remote method (using the name as same as the remote method on Java-side) to handle the request from Java-side, so that we can always find the receiver on Transact() and the same name remote method as the AIDL sender. Through using pairs of onTransact() and transact() methods as sender and receiver on both sides, the communication between Java- and Native-sides is established. Therefore, cross-language interaction can be detected via matching the use of AIDL on Java- and Nativesides (*e.g.*, the Stub/Proxy pair, the onTransact() methods, and the implementation of the remote methods and the transact() methods). We can then determine the entry-points for static analysis accordingly.\n\n![\nFigure 5: An example of AIDL-based cross-language communication model. The code snippets are simplified for better illustration.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ivh91dZoFAwRzZ-mHpI79.png?height=522&width=485)\n\nAn example of AIDL mechanism is shown in Figure 5, where the method getCameraInfo() uses AIDL to implement the communication between Java and C++. A pair of a sender and a receiver on each side of AIDL (*i.e.*, the client and the service) handles the cross-language communication. The caller (line 3) invokes the method getCameraInfo() which is firstly defined as an interface in line 6 and then implemented in line 14 (the detailed implementation is omitted). In the corresponding native library (lines 16 to 24), the receiver onTransact() handles the request and further invokes the method getCameraInfo() (line 23). The get CameraInfo() method then executes the method implementation and sends the execution result back to the Java-side onTransact() method (line 9), which is further passed back to the caller (line 3). Note that the getCameraInfo() in line 6 and the getCameraInfo() in line 18 are the two interface methods that both invoke the transact() method (omitted) to establish the communication between Java- and Native-sides. The NatiDroid will match the pair of such remote methods and recognize them as a pair of Java entry-point and native entry-point. Note that, for the inner-language AIDL communication on both Java- and Native-sides, NatiDroid generates CFG with a similar approach, except for the identification of entry-points.\n\nJNI-based communication model. Java Native Interface (JNI) provides a cross-language interface between Java and Native code written in C/C++). This enables developers to write native methods to handle situations when an app cannot be written entirely in the Java programming language, *e.g.*, when the standard Java class library does not support the platform-specific features or program library, such as communication with the underlying hardware. In the JNI framework, native functions are implemented in .c or .cpp files. When invoking the function, it passes a JNIEnv pointer, a jobject pointer, and any Java arguments declared by the Java method.\n\n![\nFigure 6: JNI communication model. Java- and Native-sides communicate with JNI.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KNszCFi-zl3ylckTCQkwH.png?height=279&width=508)\n\nFigure 6 shows the JNI-based communication model adopted by Android. Android uses the JNI Dynamic Register to link native methods. Different from the AIDL model, the JNI-based communication starts from a registration process. When Android starts running, the AndroidRuntime class uses the startReg() method to start the registration of JNI methods, which will further invoke all JNI registration functions implemented in the native libraries. \n\nThe registration functions will register native methods with the corresponding Java class specified by an array of JNINativeMethod structures that contains the Java method name, Java method signature, and pointers to the native function. After the registration process, all the JNINativeMethod (on Native-side) is registered and linked to the corresponding Java method in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n\nWe further explain the JNI-based communication mechanism with an example given in Figure 7, which is derived from android_hardware_Radio.cpp in AOSP 8.0. The method register_android_hardware_Radio() (line 13) is called to register the JNI methods for Radio, with the JNI method information provided in line 16. Specifically, the kRadioModuleClassPathName variable (line 5) declares the containing class name of the Java method, and gModuleMethods (line 7) declares the correspondence between the Java method and the C++ function. The variable gModuleMethods is defined to contain groups of the Java method name (line 8), parameter and returned types (lines 9 to 10), and the pointer of C++ method (line 11). All the information will be dynamically registered in JVM during run-time. Finally, the C++ method involved in the crosslanguage communication is declared in line 12, while the involving Java method can be found in the java file RadioModule.java in package android.hardware.radio (lines 2 to 3).\n\n![\nFigure 7: An example of JNI-based cross-language communication. The code snippets are simplified for better illustration.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/czCJ-K5HtSWBYHp6ItYOq.png?height=338&width=494)\n\nAccording to the JNI-based communication mechanism, we extract pairs of entry-points from Java- and Native-sides. Specifically, the JNI methods and the corresponding native methods are vaguely identified by a linear sweep searching of keyword RegisterMethodsOrDie, registerNativeMethods and jniRegister NativeMethods over the .cpp files at first. Then we extract the class path name (*e.g.*, the kRadioModuleClassPathName in Figure 7) and the array of JNINativeMethod structures, from which a pair of entry-points can be located and recognized (*e.g.*, the pair of native_setup() and android_hardware_Radio_setup()).\n\n3\\.3 Cross-Language Protection Mapping Extraction\n\nAfter the entry-points on both Java- and Native-sides are identified, we further extract the protection mappings from AOSPs. In this section, we first introduce how NatiDroid generates CFG from both sides. Based on the CFG, NatiDroid then traverses the crosslanguage Android API call paths and corresponding security checks (*e.g.*, permission checks) to generate the API-permission protection mappings.\n\n*3.3.1 Cross-language CFG Generation.* We elaborate the detailed steps involved in generating cross-language CFGs. After obtaining the entry-point pairs from both Java- and Native-sides (as detailed in Section 3.2), NatiDroid first leverages a forward analysis to generate a CFG on the Native-side from each identified native entry-point. If the native-side CFG does not contain any security checkpoint (*e.g.*, permission check, *UID* check, and *PID* check), we discard the CFG for computational efficiency. Otherwise, NatiDroid further utilizes a backward analysis to build a Java-side CFG starting from the paired Java-side entry-point to an Android API. If the reached Android API is further invoked by other Android APIs, we extend the CFG until the API is not called by any other APIs. The CFGs generated from both sides are then connected with the communication models identified in Section 3.2. We detail the mechanisms unique to Android that require additional work to handle as follows.\n\nHandling the service identifier. The aforementioned AIDL is of ten used to invoke remote methods in service. Before the invocation, the service is usually pointed by passing a string to the getService or checkService method, for example, the string “media.player” in line 19 of Figure 8. When building the call graph, we need to handle such remote invocation and identify which class is the identifier string actually pointed to. These services are registered to the system through an addService method (either on Java-side or Native-side). Therefore, we can automatically collect the corre spondences between these identifiers and service classes from it. First, we scan the Java and C++ files looking for addService meth ods. Then the program confirms whether the method is ServiceManager.addService or defaultServiceManager->addService, separately. Once confirmed, the program extracts a pair of service class and the corresponding identifier from the parameters; for example, the string identifier “media.player” in Figure 8 will be paired with its service class MediaPlayerService.\n\nHandling Android strong pointer. Although the strong pointer defines the type variable, the type is not necessary to be restricted. Therefore, we need additional efforts to get what type the strong pointer actually points to from the context. According to the strong pointer mechanism, when we find that a member function is called, if the object is declared as a strong pointer, the invocation of the member function will be determined automatically. The NatiDroid will first trace the statement where an object is assigned to the strong pointer. If it is assigned through method getService(), the type of the object will be determined by the passed service identifier; otherwise, NatiDroid will determine the type of strong pointer according to the variable type returned by the function.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jI_UIdLyCqoJQUwWcIKYH.png?height=309&width=1077)\n\nHandling member variables. A class member variable is also possibly assigned by a strong pointer. For example, in line 7 of Figure 8, the setAudioSource() method of the mMediaRecorder object is invoked, but from this line of code we cannot determine the type of variable mMediaRecorder so that we cannot determine which setAudioSource() method has been invoked. By looking up in the referenced header file (from line 23), we find that this variable is a member variable of class MediaRecorder. Therefore, to find out the type of this variable, we can search the entire class looking for the assignment or initialization statement. Note that the assignment should be ignored if the assignment releases the pointer, *e.g.*, pointing the variable to a null pointer. In this case, the variable mMediaRecorder is initialized as the return value of createMediaRecorder in the class constructor (line 12). We have explained how to determine the return type of createMediaRecorder in the previous paragraph, handling Android strong pointers. To implement the process automatically, if a variable cannot be tracked in the local scope, NatiDroid will point to the header file to check whether it is a member variable, and thus the tracking scope will be expanded to the entire class.\n\nHandling particular access control. Binder transaction executes with the identity (*i.e.*, PID and UID) of a caller. If a transaction needs to run with callee’s identity, Binder.clearCallingIdentity() can temporarily clear the caller’s identity, so that the callee’s identity will be checked during the transaction. Then the caller’s identity can be restored by Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(). To handle such intervened access control, NatiDroid uses callee’s identity for security control for all methods between the two Binder methods.\n\n*3.3.2 Protection Mapping Extraction.* We present the workflow of extracting the protection mapping of Android APIs. After obtaining the cross-language CFG, we resort to a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy to check if there are call paths between Android APIs in the *Java API Framework* layer and security checks in the *Native Library* layer. For each node in the CFG, if it is a Java node, we will collect all its native children and obtain the security checks defined in its children nodes. If there are more than one checkpoint on the call trace (*e.g.*, an Android API is protected by multiple permissions),\n\nwe concatenate them with *AND* operation. As inspired by Aafer *et al.* \\[9\\], we also include security checks other than permission enforcement, such as UID and PID checks. If there is more than one Android API along the track, we create a mapping entry for each of them (*i.e.*, all Android APIs along the track have the same security check). Finally, each pair of Java API node and its corresponding security check(s) in Native-side will be added into the protection mapping.\n\n4 EVALUATION\n\nThe main contribution of this work, NatiDroid, is to enable the cross-language static analysis of the Android framework. Since there is a number of existing tools \\[4, 37\\] and works \\[9, 13\\] well handling the static analysis of the Java-side of Android framework, NatiDroid specifically focuses on the analysis of the crosslanguage part of the Android framework. In this section, we run experiments to verify the performance of NatiDroid and to answer\n\nthe following research questions:\n\n• RQ1: How effective is NatiDroid in identifying permission enforcement in Native libraries?\n\n• RQ2: How many permission mappings can our tool identify that are not recognized by the state-of-the-practice approaches?\n\n• RQ3: How can our tool contribute to real-world security evaluation?\n\nWe use NatiDroid to extract the API protection mapping for 5 AOSP versions – 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, and 10.0. We obtained the source code from the official AOSP repository \\[7\\]. The experiment ran on a Linux server with Intel (R) Core (TM) i9-9920X CPU @ 3.50GHz and 128 GB RAM.\n\n4\\.1 RQ1: The Performance of NatiDroid\n\nWe present the statics of Permission-API protection mapping extracted from the Native libraries in Table 1 (columns 1 to 6). In each of AOSP 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, and 8.1, our tool identified more than 440 APIs whose permission enforcement take place in the Native code, while in AOSP 10.0, NatiDroid detected 282 APIs containing permission enforcement on the Native side. In Table 2, we list the permissions that have permission checks in native libraries, including 2 *dangerous* permissions, 8 *signature* permissions, and 2 *normal* permissions. *Signature* permissions are only granted if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission. *Normal* permissions refer to the permissions with minimal risk to the system and the users’ private data. *Dangerous* permissions are those higher-risk permissions that would give access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the users.\n\nDue to the lack of ground truth for the permission protection mappings, it is difficult to evaluate the overall accuracy of the extracted mappings. We therefore resort to a manual process to examine the correctness of our mappings. To this end, we manually inspect the involved source code in the AOSP codebase to confirm if the APIs will go through the corresponding security check(s) and if the condition(s) in the security check(s) is(are) consistent with the condition(s) in the mappings. we randomly selected 20% of the total mappings (*i.e.*, 421 mappings) for manual inspection and found no missing or redundant protection conditions in our mappings.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dvda026brlcuhrSnWkMBX.png?height=308&width=506)\n\nWe further looked into the results on the affected API in each AOSP. In AOSP 10.0, the number of affected APIs decreased significantly, compared to other versions (282 in AOSP 10.0 *vs.* 456*.*5 ± 7*.*5 in AOSP 7.1 to 8.1). Through the manual code review, we found that two *signature* permissions, ACCESS_DRM_CERTIFICATES and CONTROL_WIFI_DISPLAY, have been removed in AOSP 10.0. At the same time, the code related to the audio service was refactored and simplified, which greatly reduced the number of exposed methods.\n\nAnswer to RQ1. NatiDroid identified more than 440 APIs that are protected by permission enforcement in the Native code in AOSP 7.1-8.1, and 282 APIs in AOSP 10.0, which are verified by manual inspection (20% sampling).\n\n4\\.2 RQ2: Comparison with other mappings\n\nState-of-the-art works use static and dynamic analysis approaches to extract the API-permission protection mapping from the Android framework. For instance, Axplorer \\[13\\] and Arcade \\[9\\] use static methods to retrieve the protection mapping. Dynamo \\[14\\], on the other hand, extracts the mapping by leveraging dynamic analysis.\n\nThis RQ compares our results with the mappings derived from these approaches. Unfortunately, the mapping from Dynamo lacks method signature information (*e.g.*, class name, return type, and parameter list), which is required to identify a method (e.g., there could be methods with identical names in different classes). We cannot accurately compare our mapping with Dynamo’s mapping.\n\nTherefore, in this RQ, we compare our work with Axplorer and Arcade. The mappings of Axplorer and Arcade are derived from their public repositories3 Note that since both works only released their mapping results (for AOSP version 7.1 and under) in lieu of the tools, we are unable to obtain the mappings on AOSP 8.0, 8.1, and 10.0. Table 1 presents the comparison of permission-API protection mappings on the five AOSP versions. Unsurprisingly, sinceNatiDroid only focuses on the permission checks in the Android Native libraries, while Axplorer and Arcade only work on the Android Java framework, there is no overlap between NatiDroid and the two works, respectively. As shown in the first two columns of Table 1, the number of newly identified permissions that are missed in previous works ranges from 9 to 12 in the five AOSP versions. There are 282 to 464 Android APIs associated with these permissions (*i.e.*, invoking these APIs requires the corresponding permissions to be granted), counting up to approximate 30% of the mappings reported in the previous study, which are overlooked in the previous work that only analyzed the Java-side of the Android framework. Table 1 reports the breakdown of the mappings based on the permission protection levels. The mapping results contain the permissions in *signature*, *dangerous*, and *normal* levels. Missing these mappings, especially the ones for the dangerous permissions, will lead to false results in detecting security issues of Android apps, such as permission over-privilege (detailed in Section 4.3). Thus, the main security and privacy threats to the majority of Android apps (*i.e.*, thirdparty apps, which usually have no access to *signature* permissions) are caused by inaccurate mapping of *dangerous* permissions. It is therefore worth highlighting that NatiDroid has identified the mappings for two additional dangerous permissions CAMERA and RECORD_AUDIO, which are closely related to user’s privacy.\n\nAnswer to RQ2. NatiDroid is able to identify 2 dangerous permission, 8 signature permissions, and 2 normal permissions that previous works have missed. Approximate 30% of the mappings reported in the previous study are related to these permissions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OaS_Jk63wgyadrvD3U7kU.png?height=234&width=443)\n\n4\\.3 RQ3: Applications of Protection Mappings\n\nThe protection mappings can be leveraged to detect security issues of Android apps, such as *permission over-privilege*. In this subsection, we evaluate the effectiveness of our extracted mappings in identifying the security vulnerabilities.\n\nWe include two categories of Android apps in our experiments: the custom ROM apps that are pre-installed on the devices, such as *Camera* and *Calendar*, as well as the third-party apps that users can download from official or alternative app stores (*e.g.*, social networking apps, banking apps). The experimental dataset contains 1,035 custom ROM apps extracted from five Android custom ROMs of four vendors (*i.e.*, Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Xiaomi) and 10,000 third-party apps randomly downloaded from the Google Play store.\n\nTable 3 shows an overview of the dataset in use. We use the permission protection mappings extracted from AOSP to detect security vulnerabilities in both the custom ROM apps and third-party apps. The AOSP mapping may miss some vendorcustomized permissions (*e.g.*, huawei.permission.SET_SMSC_ADDRESS), which may be used in the custom ROM apps. Nevertheless, we argue that using the AOSP mapping may miss some vulnerabilities caused by the misuse of vendor-customized permissions but will not affect the results corresponding to the official permissions, serving as the main scope of our study.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s8zFot94vQXy6OXZDzgEo.png?height=252&width=1075)\n\nPermission Over-privilege Detection. Android app developers access Android framework functionalities by invoking Android APIs. Some APIs have access to sensitive information, such as reading the contact list, are protected by permissions. Developers need to request such permissions from the Android system before accessing the sensitive resources. Specifically, a list of required permissions need to be declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file, and the corresponding permissions protected APIs are to be invoked in the app’s implementation. \n\n![\nFigure 9: False-positive over-privileged permissions in previous works detected by NatiDroid.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vMt5rABrFSO4OWD0EQy_m.png?height=255&width=470)\n\nAccording to the Android developers’ documentation \\[5\\], app developers should request a minimum set of permissions required to complete the app’s functionality, as introducing additional permissions will increase the risk of privacy leak. However, developers usually (either intentionally or unintentionally) request permissions that are not related to the functionalities actually implemented in the app, and hence, not necessary \\[17\\]. To detect apps with the permission over-privilege issue, we extract the reachable APIs of the app (with a 30-min timeout), and retrieve its protection conditions (*e.g.*, permission, *UID*, *PID*) according to the mappings. For instance, when invoking an Android API, it may check the *UID* (*e.g.*, uid == AID_SYSTEM checks if the app has system privilege) and the *PID* (*e.g.*, callingPid == getpid() examines if the method is called by its own process) along with permission enforcement. While the *UID* can be retrieved statically, the *PID* has to be determined at run-time, thereby cannot be obtained through static analysis. Nevertheless, the apps included in the experiment are custom ROM apps and third-party apps, which cannot possess *PID* of Android system services. Therefore, it is safe to assume that callingPid == getpid() will always return false in our tested apps. Finally, if the app declares permission (in the AndroidManifest.xml file) that is not required (*i.e.*, no APIs associated with the permissions found in the app), we flag it as an over-privilege case. Results. Table 4 presents the over-privilege detection results. \n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our mappings in pinpointing the permission over-privilege issue, we compare previous works’ results with our results. Recall that NatiDroid only extracts protection mappings from the Native libraries, in our results (*i.e.*, *Nati + Ar* and *Nati + Ax*), the Java-side mappings are derived from Arcade and Axplorer. We identify 95.8% and 95.5% apps with a permission over-privilege issue using Arcade’s and Axplorer’s mappings, respectively. Among their results, we identify that 66.6% and 54.2% apps (in Arcade’s and Axplorer’s results, respectively) contain false-positive results caused by missing Native-triggered permission mappings. Specifically, as shown in the last four columns of Table 4, there are 8,063 and 357 permissions that are erroneously identified as over-privilege by Axplorer in 71.5% third-party apps and 22.2% custom ROM apps, respectively; for Axplorer, 7,894 permissions in 71.38% third-party apps and 309 permissions in 21.02% custom ROM apps are found to be false-positive. Interestingly, both Arcade and Axplorer report that a significantly high proportion of apps (approximately 96%) suffer from a permission over-privilege issue. We therefore take an in-depth look into their detection results and observe that the majority of their false positives are caused by missing native triggered INTERNET permission mappings. As illustrated in Figure 9, we further present the breakdown of permissions that cause the false positive results in the comparing methods. \n\nSpecifically, missing INTERNET permission mappings leads to 6,661 and 6,660 false positives in Arcade’s and Axplorer’s results. Other missing permission mappings that contribute to the false positives include RECORD_AUDIO (623 false positives in both Arcade and Axplorer), MODIFY_AUDIO_- SETTINGS (424 and 256 false positives in Arcade and Axplorer, respectively), and CAMERA (355 false positives in both Arcade and Axplorer).\n\nManual inspection. Due to the lack of ground truth, we manually inspect if the over-privileged permissions detected are indeed unneeded by the containing apps. The first two authors of this paper and three security researchers are involved in the manual inspection. The result is determined via majority voting. For each app, we decompile the *APK* file and locate the relevant APIs. Then, we manually check the app’s context and determine whether the invocation of the APIs meet the conditions in the protection mappings. As this process involves immense manual efforts, it cannot scale to cover a large number of apps. Hence, we manually verified 100 randomly selected apps. Our manual analysis indicates that most of the cases are true positives (95%). The remaining five apps contain implicit parameters passed to the APIs to be examined,which cannot be precisely inferred via static analysis. Nevertheless, we resort to a dynamic approach to verify the remaining five apps. Specifically, we remove the permissions in question from the AndroidManifest.xml file and repackage the app. Then, we manually test the app on an emulator to confirm if the app crashes or the corresponding functions are disabled. As a result, the removal of the permissions in question has no impact on the apps, suggesting that these permissions are indeed unneeded.\n\nAnswer to RQ3. Our tool identified that more than half of the over-privilege results from state-of-the-practice tools are false-positives, which is caused by missing Native-triggered permission mappings.\n\n5 THREATS TO VALIDITY Android versions. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate cross-language static analysis of the Android framework andbuild a prototype system, NatiDroid, to extract API-permission mapping from the Android operating system. To compare with the state-of-the-practice works Axplorer and Arcade, which are close sourced and only generated the mappings up to Android 7.1, in our experiment, we extract the mappings from the latest versions they have (i.e., 7.0 and 7.1) and three newer versions (i.e., 8.0, 8.1 and 10.0). Nevertheless, the proposed solution can apply to any Android version, with further engineering works to be done in the pre-processing module. Custom ROMs. Android smartphones such as Samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi, are shipped with vendor-customized Android systems (i.e., custom ROMs) rather than the AOSP. Unfortunately, these custom ROMs are not open-source. The proposed solution takes the source code as input; therefore, it cannot extract permission mappings from these close sourced custom ROMs. However, smartphone vendors can use our solution to analyze their customized Android versions based on their source code. Nevertheless, to maintain the compatibility of running third-party apps, such custom ROMs are not likely to modify the normal and dangerous level permission specifications of AOSP that third-party apps can access, but rather add a few signature level permissions for their own system apps. Therefore, the results derived from AOSP will not affect the security analysis of third-party apps, which are the majority in the Android ecosystem. On the other hand, with NatiDroid, thirdparty vendors can perform an inner security analysis on custom ROM source code, determine whether there are errors in the implementation of permission mappings, and further detect permission over-privilege before releasing an app. Static analysis. When detecting over-privilege issues in Android apps, we may suffer from the intrinsic vulnerability of static code analysis when encountering code obfuscation and reflection, which may lead to the unsoundness of our results. When building the apps’ call graph, our method may yield unsound results because it may miss the context and the parameters that can only be obtained at run-time. For example, the API android.media.MediaPlayer: void setDataSource requires the Internet permission when the data source is online media. The source is not always a static string so that it may be assigned at run-time. Nevertheless, these challenges are regarded as well known and non-trivial issues to overcome in the research community \\[34\\]. \n\n6 RELATED WORK \n\nChaoran citation, surname not first name Android API protection mapping. Stowaway \\[17\\] initially explored and analyzed the Android permission specification. \n\nThey extracted API mappings based on the feedback directed fuzz testing, and dynamically recorded the permission checks of APIs. The mappings they extracted are accurate, but the code coverage is limited. To address the limitations of low code coverage, PScout \\[12\\] uses static analysis to extract the API protection mapping. However, they did not consider the context of the API invocation, and thus may produce false positive mappings. Axplorer \\[13\\] leverages more accurate static analysis on the SDK and Android framework, and generates more precise permission specifications. Arcade \\[9\\] conducted a similar static analysis, with additional attention paid to extract other security mechanisms, such as UID and PID checks. While these works only analyzed the Java-side of the Android, none of the works has looked into the native libraries within the Android framework. In order to overcome the limitations of static analysis, Dynamo \\[14\\] uses dynamic analysis, aiming to obtain more accurate mapping. PSGen \\[39\\] conducts an analysis permission specification for Android NDK (i.e., both protected APIs and permission checks are in the Native code), which has a different scope to our approach (i.e., protected APIs are in the Java framework, while the permission checks are in the Native code). \n\nOur work fills the research gap by analyzing the native libraries and their communications with the Java framework to produce more comprehensive permission protection mappings. Cross-language analysis on Android. Chaoran NCScope: hardwareassisted analyzer for native code in Android apps A plethora of works have proposed to solve the analysis of cross-language code. George et al. \\[20\\] scanned the binary libraries and cross-referenced the information to search the call-backs from Native code to Java. Their work focuses on the JNI mechanism alone. However, the Android framework provides other IPC mechanisms, such as AIDL, which are not considered. Fengguo et al. \\[38\\] proposed a static analysis framework that focuses on performing cross-language modeling and generating call graphs for the analyzed apps. Jucify \\[36\\] conducts a static analysis approach which extends the app analysis to native codes. Nevertheless, these works are only applicable to Android apps, which are far less complicated than the Android framework we analyzed. In addition, our cross-language analysis handles various Android IPC mechanisms such as JNI and AIDL.\n\n7 CONCLUSION \n\nWe proposed a novel approach, NatiDroid, to facilitate the crosslanguage analysis of the Android framework. NatiDroid identifies the entry-point pairs of both Java- and Native-sides of the Android framework, where both sides are communicated through JNI and AIDL based mechanisms, so NatiDroid builds the cross-language CFG on the overall Android framework (Java + Native code). Based on the cross-language CFG, we extracted Native-triggered permission specifications and created the protection mappings in the native code to complement existing Java-based mappings. We further applied our new mappings to detect permission over-privilege vulnerabilities in a large dataset consisting of more than 11,000 Android apps. We finally show that using the mapping derived by NatiDroid can identify a significant number of false results existing in the state of the art, such as Axplorer and Arcade.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\\[1\\] 1999.

In July last year, I registered the Ens domain name--metamess.eth, which is the 0x address of the burned POAPs. At that time, Ens had not issued token yet. Of course, I didn’t know it would issue token. I started collecting POAP in May last year, which was earlier than registering the Ens domain name. I think it\\`s cool to enter the blockchain world and have your own domain name. So, like the Ens domain name, POAP's collection is purely based on love for it. I remember that the first POAP was the Metazoo POAP on Decentraland, and knowing POAP also started from here. It deepened my understanding of the blockchain:  the non-tamperable on-chain credentials can also be designed as badges for event participation certificates as souvenirs, What a great thing that is! From then on, I got addicted to it and started the journey of collecting POAPs.\n\nSince then, I took time every day to see where there are POAPs in the DCL scene, such as DG Casino, Metazoo, Tensaistudio, etc. They often hold events and there are POAPs to claim.Later, I found that can create event on <https://poap.xyz> and apply for badges to distribute to event participants. From the end of June to the beginning of July 2021, I created my first event in DCL and applied for the first POAP. This event is to celebrate\"100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China\",it is a major event in our country. I want to leave a mark on the blockchain for this event. I established my own metaverse exhibition in DCL. At that time, I applied for 100 POAPs. This event was very popular at the time. , everyone was very interested in the event and the POAP I designed.I was very surprised that their love is so crazy, they want to spend money to buy the POAP I designed, and my answer is: this is only for event vouchers and commemorations, not for commercial purposes! This first event was very successful.which inspired me a lot. Since then, I have also created several events at <https://poap.xyz>. The following is a list of these events:\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3353](https://poap.gallery/event/3353)\n\n![The 100th Anniversary of the Founding of The Communist Party of China](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V2g4CdB_wITcT6QGR_Dt9.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3555](https://poap.gallery/event/3555)\n\n![                  『☭』庆祝中国共产党成立100周年-- DCL线上纪念活动 01-Jul-2021                                         I remember that after applying for this POAP, Mr worthalter told me that I must use English next time, otherwise I will not pass it. Your regulations have not stated that you must use English! I've also seen a lot of POAPs in other languages ​​so far!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bAa7fbkdlGYfiCGDM25aN.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3716](https://poap.gallery/event/3716)\n\n![Gitman](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J_IpzY0BBI7OBtXusD46_.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/5517](https://poap.gallery/event/5517)\n\n![Celebration for 1000 POAPs collection 11-Aug-2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0JmuPnMEZZgEaChJRrlzE.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/7590](https://poap.gallery/event/7590)\n\n![MetaMess Twitter followers 1K 15-Sep-2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o5oQaNmTYHLjxFLYD_qna.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![Someone said to buy the POAP I designed](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ydxjoMJe7J-iQMzLw9Io3.png?height=623&width=563)\n\nAlong with it, day after day, I madly collect POAPs, it has become a part of my life, and I am keen to collect it. In the end, it has affected my work and life, and I am still so fascinated by it. One day, a friend told me that I was ranked\nNo. 1 in the number of POAPs on a leaderboard website. At that time, my number was 1000. I was very surprised about it. I don't know who built a special one for this--The ranking list of the number of POAPs, followed by many people sprinting for the ranking, many people joined the POAP collection madly, and therefore, an event I created is about my POAP number exceeded 1000, for I designed a badge that reached 1000 poaps, and also applied for 1000 POAP Claim links to distribute those POAPs to friends who participated in the event. I should be the first person to reach 1000 POAPs. At the same time, the number of POAP Wallets also started. The geometric growth, I vaguely remember that it was 200,000 addresses, and now it is 900,000 addresses. My POAPs ranked No. 1 for a long time in 2021. Therefore, in the Chinese community, many POAP collectors know the name MetaMess.\n\n![As of July 19, 2022, my number of POAPs is 3847, ranking 8th](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/unYke56GCLtixZ8lVD2Sv.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\nAs time comes to October 2021, this was a turning point for me to POAP. Mr worthalter--the CEO of POAP, sent an email to the publisher who created the event with his own mailbox. The issuer will distribute an Early issuers poap. At that time, I was very happy to receive this email from the CEO himself, but a few days later, some friends have received the second email with the Poap Claim Link, but I still hadn't received it, and then I started to get confused. Why some people who only created one event received this it, and some who only created events but failed to apply also claimed this poap, and then I sent an email to Mr worthalter, It's also didn\\`t receive his reply. Next day, I DM him a message on Discord, and immediately blocked me. I was baffled by this. Finally, I went to POAP's Discord public channel general, just typed “Hi”, as soon as I sent it, I was kicked from POAP Discord. Now, I feel very angry and frustrated at the moment, why am I the person who would like to participated in the building of the POAP, was treated so unfairly.Of course it's not just me who has been kicked, as far as I know, those who speak differently to you will be removed from the POAP community. Later, I can only found the official POAP mod or staff to help me with this matter, but they also don't know why didn't distribute this early issuer poap to me and didn't respond at the end.  Since then, I have been disappointed with POAP.\n\n![A--Screenshot of an email Mr worthalter sent me in Oct 13, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5fUwZEVi3CuN5HqweZ4X1.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![B--Screenshot of my email to Mr worthalter，but no response Oct 14, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I7nXX5zwql8_UHGkACgOm.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![ C--I DM Mr worthalter and got blocked in Oct 15, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qTxmtVqX4HeAFKVsADUD8.png?height=969&width=1920)\n\nAccording to the official statement at that time, it was said that you must have this Early issuers poap in order to create an event. For this reason, in November 2021, I used another account address to spend 518 xdai to bought an Early issuer poap on the [Epor.io](http://Epor.io) market，But at that moment I no longer have the idea of ​​creating POAP events. In addition, in December, there was a big crash in the cryptocurrency market, and the digital currency I bought also suffered serious losses. When the market was at its worst this year, I sold my all currency assets that lost a lot of money， However, on July 8, 2022, the [Epor.io](http://Epor.io) website that POAP official supported also stole my Early issuers poap because of a loophole, and was sold by the thieves, and they did not roll it back for me. Because of this, I began to slow down the pace of collecting POAPs. At the end of last year, the number of POAPs reached 3,500 (starting from the end of April 2021), and as of July 2022, the total number of POAPs is 3847 POAPs, which means that I only collected 347 POAPs in the 7 months of 2022. Because of the above events, I have already only collect POAP occasionally, and now, on the rank leaderboard, the people above me are all above 4700+,They were just behind me last year!\n\nNow, just a few days ago, you burned all the 3847 POAPs in my address and threw them to the black hole address, and my whole person collapsed, because those POAPs were collected by me day and night, reversing my work and rest time. Go to DCL to play games, go to various Discord project parties to listen to AMA meetings, spend hundreds of days in Coingecko dapp to click and sign in to get 4000 points and spend them in exchange for Coingecko's POAPs, purchased in the exchange market, there are also many POAPs that may launch airdrops, such as METAMASK, SSV,The Graph,etc. POAP for my donation to the [Gitcoin.io](http://Gitcoin.io) Grant-initiated project--(I also made two donations to POAP from G11 and G12 last year, totaling $15.) and more I created POAPs for my own events, and so on. Every POAP has a story about me and them. every POAP is unique. they have been bound to my soul like a body, but now they are being torn apart and strangled at will.Those days and nights, sleepless for collect POAPs. My health was also damaged because of this, and I went to the hospital because of chest pains.Can you understand the bitterness? Now all POAPs have been burned by your merciless fire! Is it just so ruthless, unreasonable, rude, and doing things so ridiculous? You think that this is an abnormal frequency, you discriminate against the Chinese, and you may have difficulty understanding how diligent the Chinese are! I can tell you that China's rising is the result of our sacrifice of sleep time, time with our family, and our own health in exchange for it!\n\n![All POAPs of my address have been burned in July 19, 2022 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAQGLXiYR6tEEdV94aAe7.jpg?height=1624&width=750)\n\n \n And those addresses that have more than a dozen or dozens of POAPs with the same event, why don't you destroy them, those trading website you support have loopholes and thus steal our POAPs, and tens of thousands of POAPs were stolen by hackers, and did not respond to this, issued no warnings and technical countermeasures to the hackers! No penalty for thieves' addresses! No response to losses caused by [Epor.io](http://Epor.io), which you support! The absurd accidents keep happening, and you just blindly evade responsibility and shirk responsibility! And for those of us who are defenseless, give our time, money and hard work, and love your POAP collectors, to be unreasonable, rude, and ruthless, there is no notification from beginning to end, no reasonable explanation, no logical procedure, no Compliant rules and regulations, just unreasonably burn down the POAPs that I used to be crazy about and love, this is like a fatal shot! What is the difference between this and the current shootings in the United States that are shooting and killing innocent civilians! You don't certify the contributions of our collectors, nor do you improve the technology to prevent hackers from stealing, but you shamelessly named farmers for POAP collectors and put black hands on our necks,What are your so-called criteria for judging illegal operations? So far there is no standard! But what you have done to us？we Chinese POAP collectors can debate with you!\n\nYou manage a decentralized business in a centralized and abusive way, get out of the way, web3 does not welcome you!\n\nYou are the disgrace of the blockchain, the dictator, the devil, your actions go against the spirit of blockchain！\n\nYou are indiscriminate, disregarding people's feelings, abusing power, acting recklessly, and destroying humanity!\n\nYou are not qualified to reshape the world in the blockchain world! Shame on the blockchain!!!\n\nGive back my POAPs and give us justice!Verifiable on-chain! In Blockchain we trust!\n\nWe love POAP, but hate dictators!!!\n\n![I also made two donations to POAP from G11 and G12 last year, totaling $15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ly8K3dY4lVt1i-0E7tey3.png?height=842&width=1128)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658549760, "digest": "ELXDJoX5IL-ytiD_DW43Obbk5KekpWK4zD6mY3JMPCg", "contributor": "0x49087eb6f9529EB02a508fB820D7b4d0b52E4881"}
{"id": "xy2doxAaRTrwovmIPBl8Rskmp-NMTce3Rt58D6LSr-k", "title": "ETH合并前相关赛道投资机会", "body": "**1、关于此次合并的确定性**\n\n首先是合并的确定性相对来说还是比较高的，两个测试网虽然都出现不同程度的bug，不过依旧是有解决的方案，包括开发者的言论以及时间点定在了难度炸弹爆炸之前，在难度炸弹不会再度推迟的情况下合并9.19合并似乎是板上钉钉的。\n\n市场也在炒作合并的预期，信标链质押赛道的ldo、rpl、ssv，layer2赛道的op、polychain、lrc，跨链相关的hop，算力迁移的etc。\n\n不过确定性最大的还是以太坊，本来市场上就是在炒作预期，合并的事件也是充满了不确定性，因此相关赛道相对以太坊来说可能并不会出现过多的alpha收益，当然预期和实际的落地还是有区别的，以太坊减产后的叙事面（通缩+赋息资产）和资金面（加密史上最大的供应端缩减）都能给予市场持续的正反馈。\n\n**以下的分析与其说是投资机会，不如说是风险提示。**\n\n**2、质押赛道相关机会**\n\n关于质押赛道，该赛道是同合并最密切相关的，龙头就是ldo，当前价格在1.6附近，再涨一倍市值就能比肩defi的龙头标的，从性价比的角度来看合并之前可能投资机会并不是很多，虽然机构的成本在0.5附近；\n\n![ldo市场份额](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dIebMw8dMltfe3olxvVTE.png?height=974&width=1230)\n\n当然合并之后还是持续看好lido的，一方面，信标链质押赛道和defi有一个很大的不同，即内部的收益率不会受限于TVL的增长，defi板块的某个标的锁仓量会随着内部tvl的增长降低apr，将导致资金向其他可替代标的溢出，而信标链质押赛道则不同，平台内部锁仓量的增长并不是导致收益率降低的原因，某个质押平台的收益率是和整体信标链质押总tvl相关，因此lido随着资金量的增长并不会因为apr的降低导致资金的溢出，故相关赛道中的rpl上线至今也没有蚕食lido过多的份额。\n\n另一方面真正合并之后信标链的质押收益率会出现将近翻倍的增长，这足以超越主流竞争公链的年华收益率以及defi中的eth质押收益率，并且steth的设计也能够释放质押的流动性并赚取收益，在合并之后可能会出现defi+主流公链资金流向ldo的可能性，因此lido有很大的可能性将锁仓量做到defi领域中的第一。不过合并之前还是保持谨慎。\n\nSsv，号称第三方质押池和节点运营商之间的防火墙，和lido没有本质上的竞争关系，反而是合作关系。总体上就是提高第三方质押池（lido）对接的节点运营商的安全性，另外通过分散私钥的技术减少掉线后罚没质押以太坊的风险。但是现在主网还没有上线，因此合并后也会在质押赛道中分一杯羹。\n\n![SSV network](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xof3wiWHDGfWbG0VOnqT7.png?height=830&width=1256)\n\n**3、扩容赛道相关**\n\n关于layer2扩容赛道，pos完成之后，对二层网络来说算是利好，之后以太坊开发组主要会着手于包括对可扩展性的改进，例如 Danksharding、Proto-danksharding 和通过 EIP-4488 降低第 2 层调用数据成本，包括后续也会上线其他的几个Eip以增强Layer2对以太坊数据层的可用性。但是这些都是在合并完成的基础上才会推进，本次合并本来就是在炒作预期，而对二层实质性的利好属于预期中的预期，因此和本次合并的相关性并不是非常高，炒作空间有限。\n\n![layer2相关](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SsYSxIGv-uBR_GEk9n6YS.png?height=422&width=1248)\n\n**4、算力迁移赛道相关**\n\n关于算力迁移赛道，可能并不会有很多的投资机会。以太坊当前矿机主要是分为两种，10-20% 的矿工是基于 ASIC，剩下的是GPU矿机。大部分GPU矿场会转型，为视频流应用程序构建基础架构、2D 和 3D 对象的渲染以及云服务器，etc、rvn、erg等也是可以作为pow挖矿的选择。合并后，etc以太坊经典是唯一可以使用以太坊 ASIC 矿机挖掘的其他 PoW 加密货币，只有etc的哈希算法与 ETH 兼容。\n\n![GPU挖矿份额](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XBn05DmQlhQXDyC2b0IQ7.png?height=686&width=1220)\n\n可见，从矿工的角度来说pow之间的算力迁移并不是刚需，还有很多选择去维持一定的收益率，并且就算算力迁移发生，一方面，大量矿工涌入将大幅提高这个代币的挖矿难度，从而导致挖矿奖励降低，最终结果是大多数矿工无法盈利。同时，从生态层、网络使用率可能不足以支持价格的长时间高位。\n\n综上，合并之前炒作预期确定性最大的还是以太坊，而相关赛道的投资机会还是比较局限的，**相对以太坊可能并不会有过多的alpha收益**；还是回归标题，**本次探讨的是合并之前相关的投资机会**，合并之后会有什么进展还需要追踪。\n\n**欢迎交流探讨\\~**\n\n**欢迎加入@7up DAO**\n\n[https://twitter.com/cheng_shutong](https://twitter.com/cheng_shutong)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658549918, "digest": "t6u4ve87XMkH6kzhRa-u6IQ7qfC5onK_R4XWUqfqtSk", "contributor": "0xa1C5062926FeF0A7F7CfBf6BCf5b9b8d232b0cd8"}

But there is a whiff of desperation here, of trying to latch onto the TikTok horse as it bolts away, taking all of Instagram’s popularity with it.\n\nToday, Meta has [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/new-ways-to-create-instagram-reels-remix/) that virtually all video uploads will now become Reels, whether you want them to or not, while it’s also added a range of new creative tools for Reels as it doubles, and triples down on the short video format.\n\nThe main change is in bringing all video clips into the Reels feed.\n\n*As explained by [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/new-ways-to-create-instagram-reels-remix/):*\n\n* [Access now➔](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvEvSvgDD3rquWt0mqInH4askEo_jfjFWRb0dINDSG26Yf0J_L-DawX8GmiTD2cZYfYl0YWRZ3mcY9cgDpVzq_WM0rnjoOUo6kNGePx3Zg46CjV2MA-AgRsJ6rK74magfQHCi6U8nOHt7KY_Q_8BI7kZGfADWkRRdiVqFlu0k8_O3vKB5G50VjM4VMfJJLWXozLF4vbU7sk-iNn12NfHyrhw6Wu24Cf3m_wBu_AX-dAlRna0QFEMmdId6EQ6cH9KSk-wp1kDT8EKyEin8lr3KPYiTKLuZpBWLZeLaqEHSHb-FK-cx3C98OoKukNpQQz8NRkvHMZancBkzaN048OD2pwx6wJpJ-mggFmJ8UkWPCcjhxc_A&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEhzc-MOOe5YEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://www.marketingdive.com/trendline/cookie-alternatives/267/%3Futm_source%3DMD%26utm_medium%3DNative%26utm_campaign%3DChicory)\n\n  TRENDLINE\n\n  ### How marketers are preparing for a cookie-less world\n\n*“Since reels offer a more immersive and entertaining way to watch and create videos on Instagram, we’re bringing the full-screen experience to your video posts, too.

That’s not exactly short form, which means that pretty much all uploaded videos in the app will now be fed into the Reels stream.\n\nIn some ways, that makes sense. Reels is the [fastest growing content format in the app](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-adds-new-boost-promotion-option-for-reels-clips/627650/), and the broader popularity of TikTok has led to habitual changes in consumption behavior, which means that users are now instinctively more aligned to the format.\n\nIn that sense, Instagram should feed into it where it can – but still…\n\nThe broader concept would be that as more people watch Reels, more content can only be beneficial for engagement, while it should also mean more views on your clips, as they’ll be surfaced within that stream.\n\nBut it could also make Instagram less differentiated, less unique - and again, it does feel a little desperate from Zuck and Co.\n\nEither way, it’s a new dawn for Instagram content, and it’ll be worth monitoring your stats, and considering how you can best lean into the latest Reels trends to maximize engagement.", "timestamp": 1658550538, "digest": "ypR9eZCDgfr3q1KJ237feH3ihH4p5va9oaCel87eKjs", "contributor": "0x0B370be3b0aD83cB5AC159e3Fee5Ea7209B6cD83"}

一、撸毛做交互，分析数据的重要性\n\n现在做撸毛交互非常的卷，在交互的过程中，知己知彼才有可能撸到大毛。项目方面对大量的用户时，会做筛选过滤掉单纯撸毛的用户，留下真正的用户给与更多的奖励。\n\n根据过往dydx等项目发空投的经验，项目方会根据阶梯发放奖励，构成阶梯的指标有：交互金额，交互次数，交互功能，交互日期等。\n\n要做到自己的交互的金额和频次大于大部分人时，你才能获得更多的空投，如何知道这些数据呢 ?\n\n区块链的数据库是开源的，任何人都可以查看，我们可以使用SQL语言查询各个项目的交互信息，下面是使用dune数据库进行分析的步骤。\n\n# 二、partybid为例进行数据分析\n\n本篇教程以partybid为例，进行数据分析。\n\n分析一个项目的前提是，你已经确定这个项目未来会发币，项目靠谱有需求，最近有融资投资，有知名投资机构。\n\n## 2.1、寻找项目的合约\n\n首先去[partybid官网](%5BPartyBid%5D(https://www.partybid.app/all))，参与一次众筹，通过[区块链浏览器](https://etherscan.io/)查询交互的合约名称是什么。\n\n下图是我交互完成后的链上记录，可以点击红框查看合约地址。\n\n![未命名1658543640png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-10-34-23-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658543640.png)\n\n进入合约页面后，点击 Contract查看合约的名称是：NonReceivableInitializedProxy\n\n![未命名1658544294png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-10-45-06-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658544294.png)\n\n拿到合约名称后，去dune上搜索，查看dune是否有收录这个合约的数据。\n\n![未命名1658544777png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-10-53-30-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658544777.png)\n\n发现这个合约名称并没有收录，从合约名称上看这好像不是官方的合约名称，我们回到区块浏览器继续分析，可以通过数据发现这个合约交互了792次，每次交互金额0.01，这个合约应该是众筹NFT的合约，并不是partybid的主合约，我们需要拿到主合约来分析整个项目的数据。\n\n![未命名1658544942png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-10-55-53-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658544942.png)\n\n这众筹NFT的合约肯定是通过主合约创建的，我们继续在区块链浏览器中寻找。\n\n通过下图，我们可以发现，这个合约是10天前通过红框的地址创建的，这个地址既然可以创建合约，那他自身肯定是个合约。\n\n![未命名1658545223png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-00-29-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658545223.png)\n\n我们进入这个地址，发现的确是个合约，查看他的合约代码，发现合约名称是：CollectionPartyFactory\n\n![未命名1658545348png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-03-29-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658545348.png)\n\n进入dune上，搜索合约名称，发现dune已经收录这个合约地址上的数据了。\n\n![未命名1658545568png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-06-42-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658545568.png)\n\n## 2.2、分析数据结构，寻找有用的数据\n\n可以通过函数名称粗略判断，我们要提取的数据在哪个函数中。\n\n然后通过查询语句看看存的数据是否为我们想要的。\n\n```\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  partydao.\"CollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty\"\nLIMIT\n  10\n```\n\n我们先查下第一个函数，发现当中不存在任何数据。\n\n![未命名1658545860png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-11-27-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658545860.png)\n\n我们继续查下一个函数，查询到“CollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty”中有数据\n\n![未命名1658546249png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-17-36-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658546249.png)\n\nCollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty 中有很多列，我们如何知道每列的具体含义呢，可以根据每列的名称 结合 具体的数据去猜测，再跟自己交互数据关联起来，来最终确定。\n\n_nftContract ： 众筹的NFT合约地址\n\noutput_partyProxy：可能是创建众筹项目的合约地址。\n\n我们之前参与了一个众筹，可以通过众筹的合约来验证下。\n\n众筹的合约地址：0xbd1e6e6012f969ed554806E96B3E8C519E0C14b5\n\n发现可以查到这一个合约，这个合约众筹的对象是BAYC，跟我们交互的项目一致。\n\n![未命名1658547035png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-30-44-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658547035.png)\n\n## 2.3、制定交互策略的思路\n\n我们分析数据的目的是刷交互获得空投，所以首先思考哪行行为动作会对项目方有利，最简单的就是罗列项目的所有功能，然后根据自己的判断设置对应的权重。\n\npartybid这个项目目前功能比较简单，就以下2个：\n\n* 发起众筹项目\n* 参与众筹项目\n\n发起众筹的人数少于参与众筹的人数，发起众筹的权重高，众筹成功，金额大，参与人数多的的权重大。参与众筹项目成功的权重高，参与次数多，金额大的权重高。\n\n那么到底发起几个众筹，参与多少次众筹，参与金额多少 才能脱颖而出呢，这时就需要的链上数据进行分析。\n\n## 2.4、查找数据确定交互策略\n\n### 2.4.1、参与众筹金额控制在多少好呢？\n\n我们通过链上数据可以进行查询。\n\n查询思路：\n\n1、确定要查询的数据库数据表分布在哪\n\n2、编写SQL语句进行查询\n\n通过“CollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty” 我们可以知道 partybid众筹的合约地址。\n\n“ethereum.transactions”这个表可以查询所有在以太坊上产生的交互。\n\n我们先获取到参与众筹的地址，然后看这些地址共参与了多少金额\n\n具体的SQL语句如何编写，可以自行谷歌搜索学习，然后复制(fork)下面的语句改写。\n\n```\n-- 查询用户参与众筹金额的区间\nwith\n  party as(\n    SELECT\n      sum(value / 1e18) as \"total\",\n      et.\"from\"\n    from\n      partydao.\"CollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty\" party\n      LEFT JOIN ethereum.transactions et on party.\"output_partyProxy\" = et.\"to\"\n    group by\n      et.\"from\"\n    ORDER by\n      \"total\" DESC\n  )\nselect\n  count(distinct party.\"from\") as \"数量\",\n  case\n    when party.total > 1 then ' > 1 ETH'\n    when party.total between 0.1 and 1 then '[0.1-1] ETH'\n    when party.total < 0.1 and party.total > 0.01 then '(0.01-0.1) ETH'\n    when party.total = 0.01 then '0.01 ETH'\n    else '< 0.01 ETH'\n  end as \"参与众筹金额区间\"\nfrom\n  party\ngroup by\n  2\n```\n\n![未命名1658548417png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-54-00-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658548417.png)\n\n不愿意动手查询数据的，也可以直接duen上搜索项目关键字进行查询别人已经做好的图表。\n\n**关于partybid更多的数据，可以查看我做好的图表。**\n\n[#

{"id": "OD31OsQ2D4beyDHfKWnx-qiKznB4XKrjP5oP4zoiqGE", "title": "Conspiracy & Me", "body": "### I'll never forget the 20th anniversary of 9/11.\n\nI spent the latter half of the day huddled up in my living room, carefully reading a book from Popular Mechanics called [Debunking 9/11 Myths](https://www.amazon.com/Debunking-11-Myths-Conspiracy-Theories-ebook/dp/B0751HHGMS/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=).\n\nThat night, for the first time since my teenage years, I went to bed with my lingering questions answered. I'd finally put my own conspiracy thinking to rest.\n\nThis is the story of how I came into those beliefs, and the long, winding path to ridding myself of them. It's also a meditation on how we, as a society, can do a better job of reaching people who are caught up in destructive belief systems.\n\n\n---\n\nI was 10 when the towers collapsed.\n\nWe were living in Redondo Beach, CA at the time. I'd just gotten up for school, and my mom and stepdad were intermittently and anxiously glancing at the news as they got ready for work.\n\nI remember watching footage of the second plane hitting, then being awkwardly shuffled off to school. That day, we tried to focus on normal fourth grade activities, but everyone could feel something was terribly wrong. My teacher started crying when we'd learned the towers had come down.\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur. In those days, I was obsessed with baseball—playing it, watching it, the whole deal. And I remember filtering the aftermath of 9/11 through the lens of sports. I watched every game in the MLB playoffs, every tear-filled tribute and moment of silence, including [George Bush's iconic first pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjGcCI9ByWw) in the World Series a month later.\n\nBut eventually everything went back to normal in my little world. It would be years before I'd think about 9/11 again.\n\n\n---\n\nSomewhere in high school—either sophomore or junior year—the conspiracies found me.\n\nBrowsing around the internet, I somehow stumbled across a free documentary. I don't remember which one. Maybe it was Loose Change. Or perhaps it was the first film in the Zeitgeist series.\n\nRegardless, that first exposure to conspiracy thinking was exhilarating. I felt alive.\n\nFor my teenage self—already a bit of an outsider with a rebellious streak—this forbidden fruit was delicious. It felt like I'd woken up to something big, something no one else could see. I relished in my newfound beliefs, because frankly, they made me feel intelligent, unique, and significant.\n\nOnce those seeds were planted, everything new I saw or read seemed to confirm my suspicions of foul play.\n\nIn my senior year of high school, I took a class on post-WWII American history. At one point, we dug into how the CIA had helped overthrow democratic governments around the world—in Iran, in Chile, in Guatemala. It cemented my belief that the US government wasn't to be trusted, and was capable of horrific things.\n\nDuring those years, my dad and I would often get lunch at a Jewish deli in Denver. I remember a handful of animated discussions, one in particular where I tried to argue—without any actual engineering knowledge, mind you—that it was physically impossible for a plane to cause those buildings to fall the way they did. Despite his best rhetorical efforts, my dad's arguments went in one ear, and out the other.\n\nBy the time I'd made it to my freshman year in college, my conspiracy brain was at its most impenetrable. I'd built myself a fortress of delusional certitude.\n\n\n---\n\nFrom age 20 to 30, I spoke nary a peep about 9/11.\n\nPartly because my enthusiasm had waned over the years. I no longer bought into any of the grand narratives or explanations—that it was planned by the Bush administration, or that the Illuminati were ushering in a new world order or whatever. Somewhere along the way, the speculative \"who dunnit\" stuff had begun to feel empty and childish.\n\nI also lost my zest for going any deeper into my lingering questions. Where once I was enthralled by the rabbit holes and the chase, in my twenties I channeled my energy into things like filmmaking, dating, figuring out adulthood, and building a business.\n\nNurturing the conspiracy didn't serve the same psychological purpose it once did. I found new, healthier ways to feel good about myself. I found new outlets for my time and energy. As such, many of those old beliefs just shriveled up and died on their own.\n\nIn high school and early college, I might have topped out at 7 of 10 on the conspiracy scale. But without any external intervention, or even intention or effort on my part, I cruised through my twenties at a cool 2 of 10.\n\n\n---\n\nEven though it was never top of mind, there was always a doubtful little voice in the back of my head, which would pipe up whenever someone mentioned 9/11.\n\nYet I never shared these doubts, not even with my closest friends. The social cost felt too high. There was always a fear I'd be branded a \"truther\" and that I'd carry a scarlet letter for the rest of my life. Whether that would have happened or not, I have no idea. But I always felt on edge about my dark little secret spilling out.\n\nAt this point, I had just two lingering questions—the things that stuck out to me as evidence of something fishy.\n\n1. How could two towers, designed to withstand impact from planes, be damaged asymmetrically, then fall symmetrically at freefall speed?\n2. What the hell was the deal with building 7? How did it collapse the way it did without having been hit by a plane?\n\nIn my mind, the official explanations for these things were insufficient. It felt like I was being told not to trust my lying eyes.\n\nOf course, I'd *never actually read* the official explanations myself. I'd just believed the conspiracy folks when they said the official story was bogus. My understanding of these topics came from second hand (possibly even third or fourth hand) information.\n\n\n---\n\nLike many, the 2016 election—and the ensuing years of epistemic chaos and culture war meltdowns—woke me up to the dangers of conspiracy thinking at scale.\n\nI watched as broad swaths of the political media ecosystem, both left and right, become addled with simplistic conspiratorial speculation.\n\nI saw family members become Q-Anon true believers, to the point of cutting ties with anyone who disagreed.\n\nWe all saw conspiracy thinking undermine our pandemic response and vaccine rollout.\n\nAnd of course, we all witnessed several storms of riotous violence stemming directly from widespread conspiracies.\n\nFrom my vantage, it became increasingly clear that conspiracy thinking—on the right, left, and anywhere else—is not only contagious, but inherently destabilizing. It can lead to the fracture of relationships, families, communities, and entire societies.\n\nAnd, of course, left unchecked, it can lead to dehumanization and violence.\n\n\n---\n\n2018 was unequivocally the worst year of my life.\n\nBut looking back, it taught me a valuable lesson about the nature of conspiracy thinking.\n\nHaving just moved to Tucson, I found myself disconnected from family and friends. My relationship was falling apart. My business was floundering. And I used food as an emotional escape, sending my health and fitness into a downward spiral. It was the loneliest, most hopeless, depressive year of my life.\n\nDuring those dark days, the one reliable place I found solace and comfort was in culture war media. Much as [Meghan Daum talks about making friends on \"free speech YouTube\"](https://gen.medium.com/nuance-a-love-story-ae6a14991059) after her marriage fell apart, I started going down my own rabbit hole with the \"intellectual dark web.\"\n\nIt started with podcasts like Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, and the Brothers Weinstein. And it led to YouTube, where I'd rarely miss a video from folks like Dave Rubin, Matt Christiansen, and Steven Crowder. I'm ashamed to admit it, but watching people dunk on and ridicule woke college students was gratifying in a visceral way. And for brief moments, there was light amidst the darkness of my life. I felt better about myself.\n\nThe thing about culture war media—both left and right—is that it's predicated on believing in the unambiguous badness of \"them\" (however your team defines it). Culture wars are fueled by simplistic stories about how the world works—stories that constantly reaffirm the virtue of our team, and the evil of theirs. And in culture war media ecosystems, and the resulting filter bubbles, inconvenient facts are ignored, while other facts are distorted (or invented) to fit the narrative. Everything must fit the narrative.\n\nIn other words, culture war thinking and conspiracy thinking are one in the same. The culture wars are political conspiracies at scale. And at the darkest point in my life, I was caught up in the thick of it.\n\n\n---\n\nAfter my toxic relationship ended, and I started getting healthy again, my attraction to conspiratorial thinking and culture war media vanished. As if by magic.\n\nThe healthier my body and mind became, the more I was not only uninterested in the media that had once nourished me, but I was repulsed by it. I remember one day in particular where I opened YouTube, watched two minutes of a Dave Rubin video, and said out loud, \"*Wow, this guy is a clown.*\" And I haven't been back since.\n\nAs I healed myself, I saw clearly how the culture wars had been a cheap substitute for what I actually needed and wanted out of life. It was like the shitty fast food version of belonging and meaning.\n\nThat led to a stark realization. I'm most susceptible to conspiracy thinking when I'm at my worst. When my core needs around agency, connection, belonging, and meaning aren't being met in healthy ways, I gravitate towards the nearest, loudest thing that soothes my psyche. And I suspect I'm not the only one.\n\nIn advanced industrial societies, we're good at a lot of things, but our track record of helping people meet these core psychological needs is abysmal. We live in the most materially wealthy and technologically advanced time and place the world has ever known, yet a substantial portion of the population is starving for what matters most.\n\nIt's like there's a severe drought in our collective psyche, just waiting for a spark to set off an uncontrollable wildfire of conspiracy, fear, and loathing of self and other.\n\nI've come to believe it's not \"misinformation\" that's the problem here. This isn't social media's fault. The conspiracies spreading through society are merely a symptom, not a root cause.\n\nUntil we start tackling the interconnected crises of meaning, loneliness, and physical and mental health, there's no way short of brutal authoritarianism to prevent emotionally compelling conspiracies from taking root in the minds of a dispossessed populace.\n\nIf that's true, then it's up to us, individually and collectively, to recognize this dynamic for what it is, then pull ourselves out of those downward spirals. And from there, it's our responsibility to help others do the same. There is no top down solution to this. The only things that reverse these worrying trends are individuals, then communities, learning to meet their needs in healthy, constructive ways.\n\n\n---\n\nAll of this brings us back to September 11th, 2021. The twentieth anniversary.\n\nI'd spent the previous few years continuing to work on myself, and rooting out various forms of conspiratorial thinking. I'd learned to spot and reject simplistic culture war narratives. I'd learned to go to the source instead of relying on shoddy second hand information. And I'd learned to feel at home in complexity and ambiguity, instead of needing simplistic narratives to feel secure.\n\nBut still, those two pesky questions about 9/11 remained. *How did the towers fall the way they did, and how did building 7 fall?*\n\nOn this day, the door was open for me. It was an opportunity to step fully out of the realm of conspiracy, and into the identity of Citizen.\n\nI started my quest that afternoon with a google search.\n\nI skimmed a few articles, and was immediately put off. Everything I found was seething with condescension and ridicule. There was little in the way of genuinely informative media for people seeking answers. There was only shaming and disgust, as if people who believed in these conspiracies were morally corrupted and unsalvageable.\n\nNeedless to say, this dynamic didn't help. And it nearly stopped me from searching further. Like everyone else, I want to be treated with dignity, and like an adult.\n\nBut on a whim, I grabbed a kindle copy of the Popular Mechanics book. Despite a few hints of condescension in the early pages, this book felt different. It took each claim of conspiracy seriously, on its own terms, without strawmanning or ridicule. Then it meticulously picked each claim apart, one by one, relying on a diverse array of subject matter experts. It didn't insult the intelligence of the reader, but instead catered to it.\n\nSo over the course of about three hours, I devoured the chapters that addressed my lingering doubts, and skimmed a few others. I found conceivable scientific explanations for how the damage, along with raging fires, had brought down those three buildings twenty years earlier.\n\nAnd as you might guess, I came away that evening satisfied. I believed the official accounts and explanations were, at the very least, *plausible*.\n\n\n---\n\nHere's a humbling truth about this whole saga.\n\nI'm far too much of a scientific and engineering layman to know if what I read that night is true. Without becoming an engineer myself, there's no way for me to directly answer any of these questions. I had to outsource this one to subject matter experts. And I did. That Popular Mechanics book provided enough reasonable doubt for me to put my conspiracy thinking to bed.\n\nAs I type these words, I'm reminded of this passage from Jonathan Haidt's seminal book, [The Righteous Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777):\n\n> “*The social psychologist Tom Gilovich studies the cognitive mechanisms of strange beliefs. His simple formulation is that **when we want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe it?”** Then we search for supporting evidence, and if we find even a single piece of pseudo-evidence, we can stop thinking. We now have permission to believe. We have a justification, in case anyone asks. **In contrast, when we don’t want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Must I believe it?”** Then we search for contrary evidence, and if we find a single reason to doubt the claim, we can dismiss it.*”\n\nWhen I look at conspiracy communities, including the various culture war tribes, mostly what I see is lonely, disaffected people desperate for a sense of meaning and community in their lives. I see people unwilling or unable to grapple with complexity, because the simple narratives that surround them are too seductive.\n\nThis isn't a judgment. It's just that I've been in that place. I've been that person. More than once. And I have no intention of going back.\n\nPoint being, **I was able to break free from conspiracy thinking because I wanted to. And because I *needed* to.** It was the only way for me to create a sense of coherence in my worldview, and to cement my [emerging identity as a Citizen](https://ungated.life/essay/on-citizenship/). Conspiracy thinking is antithetical to who I'm trying to become, and what I'm trying to model in the world.\n\nBut here's the thing. Reading the Popular Mechanics book almost certainly wouldn't have changed my mind in any of the preceding years. It took the culmination of everything I've written about here to get me to the finish line.\n\nHad 19 year old Rob picked up that book, it wouldn't have made a lick of difference. If I were a member of the truther tribe, finding my sense of identity and meaning amongst 9/11 true believers, I'd likely have never even picked up that book, let alone read and believed it. And had I not grappled with the culture war, and become deeply distrustful of conspiracy thinking, I doubt I would have felt the urgency to seek answers that evening.\n\nTherein lies the inconvenient truth of solving conspiracy thinking on a society-wide scale.\n\nThe easy part of this equation is creating high quality, widely accessible information that respects the consumer and treats them with dignity. The more we ridicule and shame people harboring conspiratorial beliefs, the more we push them further away and calcify their worldview.\n\nBut here's the hard part. For any information to make a widespread difference, people must want it. They must be ready, willing, and able to displace their old beliefs with new ones. Coercion and top down solutions won't solve this problem. They'll only make it worse.\n\nWe need to start treating the root causes of systemic disaffection, instead of slapping bandaids on a stab wound. We need to find new ways to bring people together, give them shared meaning, and help them meet their core psychological needs in constructive ways. Because otherwise, conspiratorial thinking shows no signs of slowing its march into the heart of the body politic.\n\nI don't have the solutions to any of that. But I believe it's one of the most important sets of problems for committed Citizens to work on in the years ahead. So I hope you, like me, are ready to work on it, together.\n\nGood luck, and godspeed.", "timestamp": 1658550714, "digest": "klkNioHOU0aaF_V6ZMSbnZKSBFXzs6nxtqbVE77apYU", "contributor": "0x802331595305BF81C9D0cd78e3d7D73186A3aAae"}
{"id": "ZNjVaoGgSZD_3XUnLnFj1l50dmvbudBWBt9pHbiU8dM", "title": "Non-Coercive Marketing: An Origin Story", "body": "For the last year, I’ve been working to improve my relationship with food, and with myself more generally. Little did I suspect this journey would also completely transform how I approach marketing.\n\nBut let’s start at the beginning. For the better part of fifteen years, food has been my drug of choice, and my kryptonite. It's my go-to strategy on those days when I want to escape, or when I need to soothe some emotional wound. Some people drink, others numb with TV or social media. My vice was, and still sometimes is, copious quantities of unhealthy food.\n\nThis pattern has wreaked havoc in my life. I gained weight all through my twenties, and my self-worth and self-image plummeted, remaining in the gutter for years. And the negative ripple effects spread into everything, from business and productivity to friendships and romance. My relationship to food left me feeling broken, fatalistic, and hopeless.\n\nOver the years, I tried anything and everything to “fix myself.” I did the diets, the challenges, the accountability programs. Every new cure I stumbled across would work for a few weeks, giving me a brief glimpse of hope, before I inevitably backslid into binging and self-loathing.\n\nI couldn’t see it at the time, but all of these attempts had one thing in common. They always started from a belief that I needed an *external intervention*, because left to my own devices, I could not be *trusted* to take care of myself.\n\n# II\n\nIn early 2021 I hired [Michael Ashcroft](https://www.michaelashcroft.org/) as a coach. Michael does some fairly traditional coaching in the Co-Active style, but he also brings his [background in Alexander Technique](https://robhardy--michaelashcroft.thrivecart.com/fundamentals-of-alexander-technique/) into his sessions, along with a bit of Zen and Daoist philosophy for good measure.\n\nAt the time, I was beating myself up for failing to complete a masochistic challenge called 75Hard, wherein you have to workout twice a day, once outdoors, for 75 days straight. No days off. No compromises. I’d made it to day 43 before falling off the wagon, and I felt myself backsliding into old patterns around food. So when I first started working with Michael, I was considering restarting that challenge. I felt like I needed something, anything, to feel back in control of my life.\n\nBut like any good coach, Michael didn’t automatically buy into the stories I was telling myself. And in one of our first sessions, he asked a question that has been resonating through my life ever since.\n\n*What if you didn’t need a fancy external system, or to put tons of pressure on yourself, to eat well? What if you just trusted yourself?*\n\nAt first, that question pissed me off a bit. All available evidence pointed to me not being trustworthy with food. Part of me was sure if I let myself off the hook, I would embark on a rampage of gluttony, the likes of which I’d never recover from. But there was another part of me that was like, “*wait a minute, what if he’s right?*”\n\nAnd just like that, I had been non-coercion-pilled.\n\n# III\n\nPhilosophically, non-coercion is based on a radical idea—that deep down, at your core, you are *already trustworthy*. You can trust yourself to make the right decision, the healthy decision, the moral decision, without the need for external pressure or coercion. You are enough as you are, and you already have the wisdom to navigate a complex world inside of you. If you slow down, and stop trying to brute force your way through things, you can access that source of wisdom whenever you want.\n\nLike I said, it's radical idea, and if you pull on that thread hard enough, it begins to unravel a good deal of how individuals and institutions in the West operate. And it usually points directly back to Daoism and other Eastern spiritual traditions. But that's an article for another day.\n\nFor me, this one question—what if I trusted myself—put me on the path towards intuitive eating. I started learning how to listen to my body. I took a leap of faith into an uncertain world where my food decisions weren't already made for me by an external authority. And I began rebuilding trust with myself, day by day. And look, I still struggle with food from time to time. But with each passing month that I approach this pattern non-coercively, it gets a little better. The more I trust myself, the more its grip loosens, and the rest of my life opens up.\n\nAnd that brings us, finally, to the subject of marketing. Because it turns out, once I'd embraced non-coercion in one area, it began to spill over into every other context of my life, including my business, and my quest to create true fans.\n\n# IV\n\nThere’s a technique in copywriting known as “twisting the knife.” I first picked it up from Ramit Sethi, but it goes back decades to the early titans of direct response marketing.\n\nBasically, you make the strategic decision to *amplify* someone’s pain. You jab your rhetorical blade someplace tender, someplace that’s already harboring an emotional wound, then you twist it and twist it good. You vividly describe their pains and insecurities so they can really *feel* them. You walk your prospect through the nightmarish consequences if they don’t fix the problem your product solves. And voila, they're in an emotional state that's more conducive to making a purchase *right now*, because they want to relieve the pain caused by your knife twist.\n\nIn the marketing landscape, there are dozens of tools like this, all designed to heighten someone's emotional state, and either nudge or bludgeon them towards making a purchase as quickly as possible. Whether that's knife twisting, adding artificial scarcity or urgency, or making emotional promises that are too good to be true, the marketing industry has emotional coercion down to a science.\n\nToday, all of this stuff feels gross to me. But back when my relationship to myself was rooted in coercion, I had few qualms with tools like this. I used brute force and emotional manipulation against myself all the time. It was my primary tool for getting myself to do things I thought I should do. So it never felt particularly wrong to use it on anyone else.\n\nIt's funny, because I've always believed in [following the golden rule in marketing](https://ungated.media/article/golden-rule/), and not treating others in ways you wouldn't want to be treated yourself. But when my relationship to myself was shitty and rooted in distrust, following that rule wasn't worth a whole lot. It's yet another example of how wounded people can perpetuate harm in the world without even realizing it, often while thinking they're doing good.\n\nAs you might have already guessed, once I started embracing non-coercion in the context of food, and feeling just how nurturing it is to live that way, so too did my relationship to marketing begin to change.\n\nThe questions driving me now are, what if we took the tools of emotional coercion off the table? What if we simply *trusted* people to make the best decision for themselves?\n\n# V\n\nI haven’t shared this much, but the long-term vision for Ungated goes well beyond helping people make 1,000 True Fans a reality. What I’m really after is to help usher in a renaissance on the internet. A new golden age, if you will.\n\nMaybe it’s just me, but most of what I encounter online these days leaves me disheartened. So much of the creative work I see feels like a cheap copy of a copy, ripped from some soulless playbook. Every human is a unique tapestry of experiences and beliefs and stories, yet little of that diversity or vibrance makes it to the web. What’s worse is that many online cultures feel increasingly captured in cycles of distrust and nihilism and cynicism and zero sum thinking.\n\nHumanity has a fuck ton of potential. Both individually and collectively, we’re capable of astounding feats of imagination and creation. But the internet as it exists right now is stifling that potential. It’s slowly turning us into the worst versions of ourselves.\n\nI wrote a piece awhile back about [bridging the trust gap](https://ungated.media/article/bridging-the-trust-gap/). Here’s a key excerpt.\n\n> Humanity’s best attributes—connection, curiosity, generosity, empathy—come out to play when we trust each other. At a fundamental level, trust is the emotional glue that makes widespread collaboration and flourishing possible. To shape the internet into the place we all want it to be—an open, generous, life-sustaining web of connection—trust has to be at the very center of how we operate.\n\nAnd that brings us back around to non-coercion, and how we choose to market and sell to one another.\n\nTruth be told, I’m still figuring out what Non-Coercive Marketing looks like as a practical philosophy. As far as I can tell, this is uncharted territory, as 98% of what I find in the marketing world is deeply rooted in coercion and distrust.\n\nSo from here on out, my plan is to [run experiments](https://ungated.media/experiments/) (in public, of course) and start iterating my way into marketing that feels positive sum, nurturing, and aligned with the world as I believe it can be.\n\nBut here’s what I can tell you. **Non-Coercive Marketing is a leap of faith that requires you to trust yourself, and trust others.** It’s about putting work into the world that is uniquely reflective of who you are, and what you stand for. It’s about creating invitations for the people who resonate, and who want to go deeper. It’s about trusting that if you’re visible in the world, the right people will find you, and be thrilled to accept your invitation.\n\nAnd with that, I would like to extend my own invitation. If, like me, you believe we’re all capable of more, and that humanity’s best years lie ahead, what I’m building at Ungated is for you. Doing creative work on the internet is only one piece of a larger puzzle, but it’s a meaningful piece.

That said, nothing is official until it's official, so we welcome any leak that comes our way.\n\n## Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4 will probably be priced the same as the predecessors\n\n \n \n\nLeaker [SnoopyTech](https://twitter.com/_snoopytech_/status/1550462164376473600), who has an impressive track record, claims that the [Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Another-round-of-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-leaks---battery-life-weight-and-more-renders_id141433) will come with 12GB of RAM which will be mated with either 256GB or 512GB of storage. They don't rule out the possibility of the rumored 1TB variant, but doesn't mention the [128GB version](https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-color-storage-options_id141333) that was mentioned in a leak recently. They do point out that their tweet pertains to the variants that will be sold by third parties, and does not include the models that will be sold exclusively by Samsung.\n\n \n \n\nThe Fold 4 will be available in Graygreen, Phantom Black, and Beige, which indicates the alleged Red version will only be available through Samsung.\n\n \n \n\nThe [Flip 4](https://www.phonearena.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-4-official-first-render-video-teaser_id141431) will have 8GB of RAM and storage options will include 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. Color options will include Blue, Graphite, Pink Gold, and Bora Purple.\n\n \n \n\nInitially, there were rumors that the Fold 4 and Flip 4 will be cheaper than their predecessors, but a recent report said that the Flip 4 might be a [little more expensive](https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-price-higher-than-z-flip-3_id141451). According to a blog called *[Gizpaw](https://gizpaw.com/galaxy-z-flip-4/)*, a European retailer has already listed the phones, and per the listings, the 256GB Fold 4 will set you back €1,863 and the 512GB model will be priced at €1,981. \n\n \n \n\nThe same [outlet says](https://gizpaw.com/galaxy-z-fold-4/) that the 128GB Z Flip 4 will cost €1,080, the 256GB edition will go for €1,158, and the maxed-out model will fetch €1,275.\n\n \n \n\nIn contrast, as pointed out by Twitter user Alvin ([@sondesix](https://twitter.com/sondesix/status/1550469151419801600)), the 256GB Fold 3 had a price tag of €1,799, and the 128GB Flip 3 was launched for €1,049. \n\n \n \n\nSnoopyTech has outright said that those prices are wrong and has questioned the credibility of *Gizpaw*. He believes that prices will stay the same as the last generation, considering Samsung's current foldable phones, particularly the Flip 3, did pretty well. The prices mentioned by *Gizpaw* look off anyway, so it's possible they are just placeholder numbers. ", "timestamp": 1658551884, "digest": "addwjWMB3liJ11GVydkvkhy-pUGsLM5ExY9RUcH3cn0", "contributor": "0x4374aCdD2d1D413856C45cA284F33e01D0Ddd533"}

{"id": "cMOqLNIwPSSqqX4lnWJSIfva4LG8M753BocQgHAZqqs", "title": "rabbithole guide snapshot", "body": "rabbithole guide\n\nIn a **[previous guide](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/hWT7XjQb1m3VjZCPBuVfETfkbIRCRhGy5CZwZdpAmAo)**, we voted on a proposal with Snapshot. But there are times when casting your own vote may not seem like the best option. However, there is still a way to put your votes to use - **delegation**.\n\nFor this step of our DAO path, we’ll be **delegating LDO tokens to the RabbitHole Metagovernance Pod**. This will increase the voting power of RabbitHole’s MetaGov Pod and directly contribute to the positive impact we strive to make on the Lido ecosystem!\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we delegate some voting power, let’s make sure you’ve got everything you need. In order to vote on a Snapshot, you will need:\n\n* An Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow\n* ETH in that wallet\n* LDO in that wallet\n\n*If you need help, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w)** and watch our guide on **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s).** And if you don’t have $LDO, you can acquire some from Uniswap. Check out **[this guide](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5391957-how-to-swap-tokens)** if you need help with swapping tokens on Uniswap.*\n\n## Delegation & Snapshot\n\nWe already learned about the decentralized voting system, **[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/)**, in a **[previous guide](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/hWT7XjQb1m3VjZCPBuVfETfkbIRCRhGy5CZwZdpAmAo)**. But for today’s leg of our journey, we’ll be delegating instead of voting ourselves.\n\n**Delegation** grants you the ability to appoint your governance tokens or voting power to an active, qualified representative while retaining ownership of those tokens. If for whatever reason you don’t feel comfortable voting on a proposal or will be unable to vote at the time it takes place, delegating allows another DAO, individual, or fellow DAO member of your choosing to vote on your behalf.\n\nIt’s important to note that delegated tokens never actually leave your wallet, so you still retain complete ownership of them. You also have the option to revoke or change your delegation at any time before voting closes. This can be useful if your chosen delegate decides to vote in a way that you are not comfortable with or decides not to vote at all. Similarly, you can still choose to cast your own vote, which will override your delegation automatically.\n\n**With that out of the way, let’s get started!**\n\n## The Guide\n\n### Step 1\n\nFirst, **navigate to Snapshot’s delegation page - <https://snapshot.org/#/delegate>.**\n\n### Step 2\n\n**Click *Connect Wallet,*** choose your wallet provider, and then **connect.**\n\n### Step 3\n\n**Enter the wallet address or ENS name** of the individual you wish to delegate your voting power to. In this instance, we’ll be delegating to RabbitHole’s Metagovernance wallet - **0x86C62a0DD8690fa2Ba6e3E3D9A18D021dBd2565A.**\n\nAt RabbitHole, we are committed to being good stewards in the web3 space. But don’t just take our word for it. When delegating votes to anyone, you should always verify that they will be using that power appropriately. You can verify all of RabbitHole’s metagovernance decisions on our **[Metagovernance Pod Gitbook](https://rabbithole-2.gitbook.io/metagovernance/),** and join in on these discussions yourself in **[our Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz).**\n\n### Step 4\n\nThen, **click *Limit delegation to a specific space*** and **enter lido-snapshot.eth** into the new box that appears. This ensures you are only delegating your voting power to this single space.\n\n### Step 5\n\nFinally, **click *Confirm*** and then **confirm the transaction in your wallet.** This will be your first and final on-chain transaction, so it will require a small gas fee.\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nYour transaction will take a few moments to confirm, and then you will see a **Delegation Successful** icon appear at the bottom of your screen. You have officially delegated your LDO tokens to the RabbitHole Metagovernance pod — thank you! Although the RabbitHole MetaGov Pod can now vote on your behalf, you still retain ownership of your tokens and are able take back your voting power at any time.\n\nTo continue down the DAO rabbit hole, check out our other guides for **[voting on Snapshot proposals](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/hWT7XjQb1m3VjZCPBuVfETfkbIRCRhGy5CZwZdpAmAo)** and **[setting up a Gnosis Safe](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/oMXunCBmaNdvvR8lKFPFY28jBAa6nmfDJECpnX2vhpg)**!

The infrastructure is getting a big upgrade & there is a parallel internet being built on top of open blockchain infrastructures enabling the creation of decentralized applications which are not controlled by single points of control & are interoperable by design.

Is it true that it has better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it! \n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS costs slightly more in than Windows.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind. \n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

{"id": "CFnLJRb68hiDCy0dhlPXRju5KpfUJt-F74CxzkeHEM0", "title": "MacOs + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS for work? Is it true that it has better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it! \n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS costs slightly more in than Windows.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind. \n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

GM made only 400 Eldorado Broughams and they were entirely hand-assembled, not made on an assembly line. When it was new, the Eldorado cost just over $13,000 at a time when a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud could be purchased for about $16,000, said Wiley. (Adjusted for inflation, those figures would be roughly 10 times as much today.) Ironically, as a collectible car, a Cadillac Eldorado Brougham is today worth more than twice as much as a Silver Royce Silver Cloud, said Wiley.\n\n* \n\nIt's a bold move for the company which has repeatedly sought to re-identify itself for the past two decades. The first attempt was the Cadillac CTS, introduced in 2003, as the entry-level luxury American car to beat the BMW 3 Series. With its angular styling and crisp handling, it was a sharp departure from the comfortable cruising Cadillacs of past years. But the CTS reached its apex with just over 60,000 sold in 2005. Production ended in 2019. In most years, BMW sold around twice as many of the 3 Series.\n\nCadillac has made other attempts at re-invention, including a shift to alphanumeric names for its vehicles before going back to names again. There was also an attempt at creating an exclusive engine for the brand, dubbed the \"Blackwing\" V8, before ending production after just two years in 2020 with fewer than 1000 made.", "timestamp": 1658556060, "digest": "nmPD0kYj6Sy1EzUA96LnzptgEfphdwQnUOdD88cWeqs", "contributor": "0x544deeb20dF8Af825dcA2c5F26ba93830338cEB0"}

Есть кое-что, чего мы еще не выяснили.\n\nВы видите это повсюду. В настоящее время для установления новых связей люди используют личные сообщения в Twitter, Discord и LinkedIn. Но из-за отсутствия эффективного управления идентификацией обычно заканчивается тем, что человек вообще не подключается или каждый день просыпается с почтовым ящиком, заполненным случайными сообщениями в личку и спамом. Распространенность мошенничества и отсутствие контекста еще больше подрывают доброжелательность, которую мы испытываем к тем, кто находится за экранами, оставляя нас с навязчивым чувством недоверия, которое душит потенциальные связи и сотрудничество. Это приводит к тяжелым последствиям со стороны безопасности: в США потери из-за кражи личных данных и связанных с этим мошенничеств выросли с 1,8 миллиарда долларов в 2019 году до 3,3 миллиарда долларов в 2020 году и 5,8 миллиарда долларов в 2021 году (FTC, 2022).

Для пользователей не существует простых способов проверки утверждений и атрибутов конкретного удостоверения, а также нет сети для обнаружения и реальной связи на веб-уровне.\n\nДецентрализованная сеть, которую мы создаем с помощью блокчейн-технологий, имеет большие перспективы в сокращении числа вредных посредников и облегчении индивидуального однорангового сотрудничества. И теперь мы выходим за рамки финансовых вариантов использования и раскрываем огромный потенциал децентрализованного общества. Но как именно мы решаем эту проблему доверия и смысла в идентичностях?

Вдобавок ко всему, Link3 вводит новый набор измерений, которые рассказывают более достоверную и полную историю о том, кто вы есть:\n\n* **Cвязи**, которые у вас есть с другими людьми и организациями, независимо от платформ;\n* **Активы**, которыми вы владеете, которые соответствуют вашему статусу и вкусам; \n* **Учетные данные**, выданные третьими сторонами, такими как DAO и проекты, о ваших ключевых достижениях и ролях; \n* И все другие **записи о действиях в сети**, такие как голоса и пожертвования, которые подтверждают ваше участие в сообществах.\n\n**Эндогенный уровень доверия** вырастет из всех этих дополнительных измерений контекстов и значений, потому что они поддаются проверке.\n\nСостоящие из всех таких связей и записей, **реляционные идентичности**, подобные этим, являются органичными и развивающимися, подлинными и заслуживающими доверия, богатыми контекстом и значимыми, точно так же, как мы являемся социальными существами и хотели бы, чтобы все были в жизненно важных отношениях.\n\n\n---\n\n## Зачем именно вам нужен Link3?\n\n***Для пользователей*** с настроенным профилем Link3 предоставляется лучший способ для **надежного и значимого сетевого взаимодействия**. Благодаря более проверяемым параметрам, объединенным в вашем профиле, теперь у вас есть целостная личность, которая говорит правду о том, кто вы есть, и позволяет вам представить себя полным и достоверным образом. Продемонстрируйте свою принадлежность, учетные данные, активы и все другие записи в своем личном профиле и начните знакомство с сетью. Узнавайте и доверяйте кому-то мгновенно с помощью профиля Link3 в сети и без необходимости для верификации ссылок третьими лицами.\n\nКроме того, по мере создания контекстно-зависимых идентификационных данных и более значимых соединений сеть будет обладать **лучшей возможностью обнаружения**. Ожидайте, что к вам обратится больше людей, которые лучше понимают ваши сильные стороны, карьерные устремления, роль в обществе и личные вкусы. Также быстро найдите подходящего человека, к которому можно обратиться, и будьте уверены, что ваши запросы будут полностью переданы, поскольку профиль подкрепляет их.\n\nПеречислю несколько простых вариантов использования с некоторыми функциями, которые будут внедрены в ближайшем будущем:\n\n* Поделитесь своим профилем в специально разработанном формате визитной карточки, чтобы быстро продемонстрировать, кто вы и почему связи будут ценными.\n* Используйте свой профиль для подачи заявок и избавьтесь от всех ненужных процессов заполнения форм и отправки подтверждающих документов.\n* Ограничьте свою личную переписку чем-то большим, чем оплата или активы, и вместо этого пригласите тех людей с чертами характера, опытом и способностями, которые вы действительно цените. \n* Делегируйте свой голос людям, с которыми у вас есть значимые связи и которым вы действительно доверяете в отношении того, кем они являются в сообществе.\n\n***Для организаций и проектов*** Link3 может стать вашей универсальной ссылкой, которая поможет вашим подписчикам узнать о вас все в одном месте.\n\nОрганизационные профили Link3 **проверены и заслуживают доверия**. Чтобы защитить пользователей от мошенничества и поддельных ссылок, распространенных в Twitter и Discord, Link3 проверяет организации по их существующим официальным аккаунтам, таким как Twitter. Организации также могут связаться с другими авторитетными организациями и продемонстрировать это в разделах спонсоры / партнеры / команда. Позже организациям также будет разрешено выдавать поддающиеся проверке учетные данные или SBT, чтобы они могли распознавать ключевых участников сообщества. Структура доверия, состоящая из таких подключений и записей, обеспечивает надежность профилей Link3. Таким образом, пользователи будут уверены, что ссылки, по которым они переходят, и все полученные обновления являются официальными.\n\nПроекты, использующие Link3, также могут быть **лучше связаны с сообществом Web3**. Пользователи входят в систему с помощью кошельков, чтобы следить за проектами, и такие подключения основаны на адресах. Проекты могли бы создавать сообщества, ориентированные на Web3, и открывать возможность взаимодействовать с ними с помощью мероприятий, связанных с токенами, эйрдропов и многого другого.\n\n\n---\n\n## Разработано на CyberConnect\n\nLink3 построен поверх **децентрализованного протокола социального графа CyberСonnect** и будет вносить свой вклад в сеть передачи данных и механизм графа интересов. Link3 хранит всю информацию о профиле и подключениях **децентрализованным** и **независимым** образом. Такие профили и подключения  **не зависят от блокчейна** и **могут быть портированы** на любую платформу, разрушая стены изолированных централизованных платформ и позволяя пользователям и проектам полностью контролировать свои учетные данные и подключения.\n\nСосредоточив внимание на профессиональном контексте на первом этапе, Link3 наилучшим образом продемонстрирует, как социальный граф CyberConnect может способствовать сотрудничеству и созданию сетевых эффектов в более связном мире Web3.\n\n\n---\n\n## Присоединиться\n\nLink3 в настоящее время находится на стадии Alpha 1.0, только адреса, внесенные в белый список, или те, у кого есть коды приглашений, могут начать создавать свои верифицированные профили. Чтобы попасть в белый список на этом первом этапе, вам нужно: 1, Быть включенным уже верифицированным проектом Link 3 в раздел \"Команда\", \"Спонсоры\" или \"Участники\". (Например, pisofa.eth включен в раздел команды [link3.to/link3](https://link3.to/link3)). Если у проекта нет своего профиля, вы должны помочь команде настроить его! Или 2, быть тем, на кого подписан super KOL ([по мнению TwitterScan](https://twitterscan.com/view/trending/kol)) или топ-100 пользователей [ethleaderboard.xyz](http://ethleaderboard.xyz/).\n\nЧтобы быть в курсе предстоящего выпуска NFT и серии кампаний по внесению в белый список, присоединяйтесь к нашему сообществу  [Discord](https://discord.gg/EpYe82aFge) и подписывайтесь на Link3 в [Twitter](https://twitter.com/link3to).\n\nЧтобы узнать больше о Link3, посетите [http:/link3.to](http://Link3.to) и присоединяйтесь к списку ожидания [здесь](https://cyberconnect.typeform.com/to/zvkcmwYN).\n\n\n---\n\n*Ссылка на оригинал статьи:*\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/cyberlab.eth/WINRy_puyYIf3k16oEcroZsJJSVZ4oXAzH_lCDe6NXE](https://mirror.xyz/cyberlab.eth/WINRy_puyYIf3k16oEcroZsJJSVZ4oXAzH_lCDe6NXE)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658555663, "digest": "sHGSIKiJ4r81rX5sAsSebW8nN6yqJx34QejUZP6T-Gg", "contributor": "0x9706114C6068704911C0439f2341129e64604144"}

Is it true that it has better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS costs slightly more in than Windows.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

合作，实现不断发展的生态系统实施等，dApp。但为什么我们会专注于阿普托斯？\n\n简而言之，我们认为 Aptos 是广泛加密领域最好的第 1 层中区块链（即独立的主区块链，例如 Ethereum、Binance Smart Chain 或 Avalanche）。让我们深入了解 Aptos，或 Pontem选择它作为我们合作伙伴的确切原因。\n\n# 历史和团队\n\nAptos [Shaikh Shaikh由](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moalishaikh)[Avery Ching](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averyching)（首席技术官）（首席技术官）在 Facebook 上（特别是 Facebook）。最初在 Meta，合作区块链和 Novi 项目链上。Shaikh 在 Novi 领导战略合作伙伴关系，而 Ching 是 Novi 加密平台团队的首席软件工程师。\n\n他们的重点是创建“区块链”，同时又不推进一个“推进”的中心化[，](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-genesis-of-aptos-ff98d86e9445)从全球安全性和有效性[。](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-genesis-of-aptos-ff98d86e9445)这就是他们重在新组织的最初的“ [Diem的创造者、研究人员、设计师和创造者，这最初是为了实现这一目标而将人员组织到区块链上”。链](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-genesis-of-aptos-ff98d86e9445)”。\n\nAptos从亿加密和的最大参与者包括他们惊人的[2美元，a1crypto、Multicoin Capital、ParaFi、Haun Ventures、PayPal Ventures、ParaFi Ventures、Haun Ventures、6z Ventures等](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/aptos-labs-a16z-multicoin-facebook-diem-blockchain/)。[“独角兽”领域](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/aptos-labs-a16z-multicoin-facebook-diem-blockchain/)——即超过10亿美元。\n\n移动语言\n\n它是语言正在为 Aptos 提供的主要安全技术特性[Move的最初版本。](https://pontem.network/posts/how-the-move-programming-language-works)\n\n了解优势的关键是它对*资源的使用。*简而言之，资源是在系统中信息的一种高度保护的存储。架构中具有重要的方法代码，确保它们不会被复制或无意删除。\n\n移动重要将重要将信息（例如代币和智能合约）存储为资源，与实现的区块链编程语言比较，该语言的安全性大大提高。移动用于 Aptos 的所有关键元素，包括[账目交易、费用、标准库、验证节点管理和配置](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)。\n\n# 其他安全功能\n\n[Ap](https://pontem.network/posts/consensus-protocols-101)构建时考虑到性，因此除了直接编入Move中的功能之外，它还具有许多其他功能。 。\n\nAptos 共识协议被认为是拜占庭容错（BFT），指的是[拜占庭一般问题](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)。想象一下一群必须共同决定作战计划的将军。他们怀疑该组织中的某个人是叛徒并提供了虚假信息。他们的“困境”是如何在这些情况下制定计划。在去中心化区块链中，拜占庭一般问题是指参与者，尤其是[验证](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/blockchain-validator)者，他们必须努力正确地确认或拒绝交易，而不能隐含地相互信任。这是潜在的区块链漏洞利用的常见来源。\n\nAptos 的 BFT 协议使网络保持平稳运行，无论一个验证者的行为如何，同时也保持世界级的速度。Aptos 使用[信誉系统来更新验证者轮换并使用“](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00960)[起搏器](https://coinyuppie.com/understanding-the-new-public-chain-aptos-the-exodus-of-the-original-diem-team-rebuilding-the-public-chain/)”同步投票。该系统在不到一秒的时间内完全验证交易（通常称为“最终确定时间”的衡量标准），这[使其成为生产中最快的区块链之一](https://pontem.network/search?query=time+to+finality)。\n\nAptos 还具有许多功能，可保护最终用户的帐户免遭利用。[还记得那些因为忘记密钥而丢失加密货币](https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2021/07/10/a-cryptocurrency-trader-is-planning-a-massive-dumpster-dive-to-find-247-million-in-lost-bitcoin/)的用户的著名故事吗？Aptos[为密钥恢复构建了新的安全方法](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)，以及防止欺诈的密钥轮换系统。\n\n# 速度和可扩展性\n\nAptos 旨在成为面向未来的区块链，供个人和企业在世界各地使用。但要做到这一点，它需要具有世界级的速度。\n\n正如文章中的那样，区块链可以通过在一篇文章中的[方式来表达：每一种网络交易量（TPS）](https://pontem.network/posts/which-blockchain-is-the-fastest) F）。秒可以提交多少事务。 TTF 是指开始（例如向朋友的钱包发送交易加密货币）和交易生效（例如您的朋友可以在他们的这些代币中）之间的时间量。\n\n尽管 Aptos 仍处于测试网开发阶段，尚未完全投入运营，但它已经超越了竞争对手。其 TTF 不到 1 秒，在 Avalanche 和 Fantom 等超快链中名列前茅。[在合适的环境下，其 TPS 可以达到行业领先的 160,000 目前，该团队计划在短期内](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-evolution-of-state-sync-the-path-to-100k-transactions-per-second-with-sub-second-latency-at-52e25a2c6f10)达到10,000 TPS，并且正在朝着 100,000+ 的方向前进。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x0fjbhd4N0jPolvKkpIP8.png?height=987&width=1400)\n\nAptos 是如何加速魔梯功能的呢？\n\n首先，Aos将共识机制与执行管道连接进行。这意味着交易几乎可以组装线一样组织起来，共识和同时魔道执行同样的优化[。](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)这比共识机制安全验证的多轮[交易要快](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)。\n\n# 可扩展性\n\nAptos 将标号为“[最](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalability.asp)[安全和最多可扩展号的第 1 层链](https://aptoslabs.com/)”。，传统系统的趋势呈上升趋势[。](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalability.asp)组织，风险发生的事件越来越高。\n\nAptos 能够有这么多的需求并从链上运行，如何让系统正常运行，而不是在其他类型[的性能](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/solana-suffered-its-second-outage-in-a-month-sending-price-plunging.html)[上](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp)。Aptos 链上进行管理和验证者的类型非常简单。[Aptos 的测试使测试在](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)升级的下基础升级，并根据需要升级网络。\n\nAptos对[同步状态的用户是其他加速向中速的，这](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)在通过其他交易区块链复制，添加验证了新的交易块，然后是网络Aptos的。同步协议非验证者同时发布这些数据，以确保确保确保确保生态系统中的每个人都同步。另外，一个操作可以使用[累累](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/developer-docs-site/docs/reference/glossary.md#merkle-accumulator)来网络同步节点。，而不是下载整个交易本。\n\n# 如今的Aptos\n\n除了为 Move 生态系统构建基础工具的 Pontem 之外，Aptos 还与其他公司合作以加速其发展。最有趣的之一是 Google Cloud，其[技术允许在 15 分钟内设置 Aptos 节点](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-labs-partners-with-google-cloud-to-enable-further-decentralization-of-the-aptos-network-f6eae47d4c65)。\n\nAptos 开发者测试网于 2022 年 3 月启动。它达到了 18,000 个完整活跃节点的峰值，使其成为当今最大的已知权益证明节点社区。激励性测试网的第一阶段在 5 月 24 日至 6 月 9 日期间运行，从 30,000 多份提交中仅选出了 100 名验证者。第一阶段取得了成功，有助于识别错误和漏洞并加强 Aptos 网络。", "timestamp": 1658556867, "digest":

Есть кое-что, чего мы еще не выяснили.\n\nВы видите это повсюду. В настоящее время для установления новых связей люди используют личные сообщения в Twitter, Discord и LinkedIn. Но из-за отсутствия эффективного управления идентификацией обычно заканчивается тем, что человек вообще не подключается или каждый день просыпается с почтовым ящиком, заполненным случайными сообщениями в личку и спамом. Распространенность мошенничества и отсутствие контекста еще больше подрывают доброжелательность, которую мы испытываем к тем, кто находится за экранами, оставляя нас с навязчивым чувством недоверия, которое душит потенциальные связи и сотрудничество. Это приводит к тяжелым последствиям со стороны безопасности: в США потери из-за кражи личных данных и связанных с этим мошенничеств выросли с 1,8 миллиарда долларов в 2019 году до 3,3 миллиарда долларов в 2020 году и 5,8 миллиарда долларов в 2021 году (FTC, 2022). Проблема по-прежнему продолжает быстро расти по мере того, как все большая часть нашей жизни переходит на цифровые технологии в ответ на глобальную пандемию.\n\n**Здесь нам не хватает чего-то фундаментального** *- сети не хватает слоя идентичности, который несет доверие и обогащен смыслом.*\n\nЦифровые идентификаторы, которые мы имеем в настоящее время, обычно не имеют измерений и в основном существуют только в виде идентификаторов, таких как записи номеров, на многих отдельных централизованных платформах. Для пользователей не существует простых способов проверки утверждений и атрибутов конкретного удостоверения, а также нет сети для обнаружения и реальной связи на веб-уровне.\n\nДецентрализованная сеть, которую мы создаем с помощью блокчейн-технологий, имеет большие перспективы в сокращении числа вредных посредников и облегчении индивидуального однорангового сотрудничества. И теперь мы выходим за рамки финансовых вариантов использования и раскрываем огромный потенциал децентрализованного общества. Но как именно мы решаем эту проблему доверия и смысла в идентичностях? И как мы обогащаем контексты целостной идентичности, выходящие за рамки записей транзакций?\n\n\n---\n\n## Представляем Link3\n\n***Link 3 - это социальная сеть Web 3 с поддающимися проверке личностями.***\n\n**Объединяя данные как внутри сети, так и вне сети, профили Link 3 служат целостными идентификаторами, обеспечивающими надежную сеть и значимые связи между пользователями и организациями.**\n\n*Link3 помогает вам укрепить доверие с помощью поддающихся проверке соединений и обогатить смысл идентичности контекстами.* В Web2 мы поддерживаем нашу публичную персону, подписываясь на людей, публикуя контент и самоутверждаясь всевозможными атрибутами и предпочтениями. Вдобавок ко всему, Link3 вводит новый набор измерений, которые рассказывают более достоверную и полную историю о том, кто вы есть:\n\n* **Cвязи**, которые у вас есть с другими людьми и организациями, независимо от платформ;\n* **Активы**, которыми вы владеете, которые соответствуют вашему статусу и вкусам;\n* **Учетные данные**, выданные третьими сторонами, такими как DAO и проекты, о ваших ключевых достижениях и ролях;\n* И все другие **записи о действиях в сети**, такие как голоса и пожертвования, которые подтверждают ваше участие в сообществах.\n\n**Эндогенный уровень доверия** вырастет из всех этих дополнительных измерений контекстов и значений, потому что они поддаются проверке.\n\nСостоящие из всех таких связей и записей, **реляционные идентичности**, подобные этим, являются органичными и развивающимися, подлинными и заслуживающими доверия, богатыми контекстом и значимыми, точно так же, как мы являемся социальными существами и хотели бы, чтобы все были в жизненно важных отношениях.\n\n\n---\n\n## Зачем именно вам нужен Link3?\n\n***Для пользователей*** с настроенным профилем Link3 предоставляется лучший способ для **надежного и значимого сетевого взаимодействия**. Благодаря более проверяемым параметрам, объединенным в вашем профиле, теперь у вас есть целостная личность, которая говорит правду о том, кто вы есть, и позволяет вам представить себя полным и достоверным образом. Продемонстрируйте свою принадлежность, учетные данные, активы и все другие записи в своем личном профиле и начните знакомство с сетью. Узнавайте и доверяйте кому-то мгновенно с помощью профиля Link3 в сети и без необходимости для верификации ссылок третьими лицами.\n\nКроме того, по мере создания контекстно-зависимых идентификационных данных и более значимых соединений сеть будет обладать **лучшей возможностью обнаружения**. Ожидайте, что к вам обратится больше людей, которые лучше понимают ваши сильные стороны, карьерные устремления, роль в обществе и личные вкусы. Также быстро найдите подходящего человека, к которому можно обратиться, и будьте уверены, что ваши запросы будут полностью переданы, поскольку профиль подкрепляет их.\n\nПеречислю несколько простых вариантов использования с некоторыми функциями, которые будут внедрены в ближайшем будущем:\n\n* Поделитесь своим профилем в специально разработанном формате визитной карточки, чтобы быстро продемонстрировать, кто вы и почему связи будут ценными.\n* Используйте свой профиль для подачи заявок и избавьтесь от всех ненужных процессов заполнения форм и отправки подтверждающих документов.\n* Ограничьте свою личную переписку чем-то большим, чем оплата или активы, и вместо этого пригласите тех людей с чертами характера, опытом и способностями, которые вы действительно цените.\n* Делегируйте свой голос людям, с которыми у вас есть значимые связи и которым вы действительно доверяете в отношении того, кем они являются в сообществе.\n\n***Для организаций и проектов*** Link3 может стать вашей универсальной ссылкой, которая поможет вашим подписчикам узнать о вас все в одном месте.\n\nОрганизационные профили Link3 **проверены и заслуживают доверия**. Чтобы защитить пользователей от мошенничества и поддельных ссылок, распространенных в Twitter и Discord, Link3 проверяет организации по их существующим официальным аккаунтам, таким как Twitter. Организации также могут связаться с другими авторитетными организациями и продемонстрировать это в разделах спонсоры / партнеры / команда. Позже организациям также будет разрешено выдавать поддающиеся проверке учетные данные или SBT, чтобы они могли распознавать ключевых участников сообщества. Структура доверия, состоящая из таких подключений и записей, обеспечивает надежность профилей Link3. Таким образом, пользователи будут уверены, что ссылки, по которым они переходят, и все полученные обновления являются официальными.\n\nПроекты, использующие Link3, также могут быть **лучше связаны с сообществом Web3**. Пользователи входят в систему с помощью кошельков, чтобы следить за проектами, и такие подключения основаны на адресах. Проекты могли бы создавать сообщества, ориентированные на Web3, и открывать возможность взаимодействовать с ними с помощью мероприятий, связанных с токенами, эйрдропов и многого другого.\n\n\n---\n\n## Разработано на CyberConnect\n\nLink3 построен поверх **децентрализованного протокола социального графа CyberСonnect** и будет вносить свой вклад в сеть передачи данных и механизм графа интересов. Link3 хранит всю информацию о профиле и подключениях **децентрализованным** и **независимым** образом.

{"id": "cdAt98i2OtsYqqp1FKGGPeUsgXbcdHG1Y9QxlLASoaA", "title": "MacOs + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

WB Montreal’s upcoming loot-focused beat ’em up won’t feature the Joker either, though Redding left the door open to Harley Quinn showing up and smashing a few things. \n \n\nBatman is in fact “really dead” Redding told a fan at the Q&A, *[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-joker-wont-be-in-gotham-knights)* [reports](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-joker-wont-be-in-gotham-knights) (via *[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-batman-is-really-dead-in-gotham-knights)*). This might seem obvious to some, since *Gotham Knights*’ reveal trailer shows the caped crusader getting blown up in the [starting minutes of the game](https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-nightwing-red-hood-ps4-xbox-one-canceled-1848905081). but WB’s Arkham games have been known for their stealthy twists and third-act reveals, leaving plenty of fans to speculate if the gravelly voiced detective would reappear before the end of the game. That turns out not to be the chase, however.\n\n#### Related Stories\n\n[PlayStation’s Summer Sale Includes Big Discounts On Star Wars, Assassin’s Creed, Batman](https://kotaku.com/playstation-summer-sale-best-ps4-ps5-star-wars-batman-1849321596)\n\n[Watch NowWhat You Should Know About Mario Striker's Big Free Update](https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-daisy-shy-guy-switch-1849319191)\n\n[Vince McMahon Finally Fires Himself, And It’s A Big Deal](https://kotaku.com/wwe-vince-mcmahon-retires-affair-investigation-fired-1849321433)\n\nThe Joker was another seeming mystery.

Once again, though, Redding laid any lingering speculation to rest. Harley Quinn, meanwhile, is still on the table. “I will not confirm or deny whether Harley is \\[in the game\\],” the director told fans. The Arkham Asylum psychiatrist turned supervillain turned frenemy is also one of the main protagonists of Rocksteady’s *Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League*, [due out next year](https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delayed-2023-warn-1848471378).\n\nWB Montreal\n\nWith *Gotham Knights* just a couple of months away from its October 25 release date, WB Montreal has also been liberally releasing new details and trailers, and its latest drop, compliments of SDCC, offers a brief glimpse into Batgirl’s character. “If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Gotham City it’s that people need symbols,” Barbara Gordon says before heading off into the night to knock some heads (the studio recently overhauled her backstory [following some controversy](https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-batman-batgirl-red-hood-nightwing-wb-gam-1848988700)).", "timestamp": 1658559237, "digest": "_-bXtMz3By4sHvp_8Ou8y2Lh9jNu7rCDagHMuI8fcrU", "contributor": "0x8b12ad955Dc874f293FAaC00169A41451617fD1c"}

Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS.

{"id": "6TyAbvfaZaxwk-H5L2uomzpCwnsLA-JHHiZxN0ACD6Q", "title": "MacOs + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS.

{"id": "-JDmBaxEVtnFMi5OA7ND7WDzvYBGF5YMZmfcDUEMEgs", "title": "MacOs + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

{"id": "_rpdGiEtdLbQZ45sR1M7L-sXil2V_pUquTGtGwCabwk", "title": "MacOS + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

Network State》](https://thenetworkstate.com/)的时机，1729社群又在酝酿新一轮的写作培训和比赛活动，而我也有幸被招募，负责课程设计、线上互动和经验分享等环节。和社群内的两位美国网友远程交流工作的这一个月，让我越来越相信Pieter Levels关于[「2035年全球将有10亿数字游民」](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/my-city-in-2022-cy-lisbon)的预测。\n\n以往我作为自由职业者都是单独作业，偶尔和客户联系下，剩下的时间我在哪个时区哪个国家都不重要。这会儿三个人在不同时区共同作业，其实也没有什么太大的不便，只要大家怀抱一个共同的愿景，工作起来也是流畅顺心。\n\n远程工作已经在欧美国家成主流，[DAO的崛起](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/creators-dao)更是起到推波助澜的作用。我从大企业离职三年有余，告别了多少曾经吐槽公司、老板和同事的负能量，从而让我有更多的时间和精力和喜欢的人一起做好玩的事儿。\n\n20多年前，一本名为[《主权个体The Sovereign Individual》](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720)的畅销书，为我们目前的数字生活时代定下了基调。书中首次提出了「主权个体」的概念，强调随着信息技术的发展，我们所处的社会阶层也将发生变化，而主权个体就是一个新的社会阶层。\n\n简单来讲，主权个体是可以摆脱地理位置的限制，在数字时代随时随地创造营收的一个群体。大多数人每天都过着一成不变的生活，在常规和习惯的作用下周而复始的过着每一天。但纵观历史你会发现，生活永远都是处于变动当中的，在不经意间缓慢地变化着，然后突然有一天产生了让我们大吃一惊的改变（gradually and then suddenly）。\n\n这些变化之所以很难被注意到，部分原因是因为主流媒体仍然引领着大众舆论，导致了单一且有导向性的叙事模式。但是互联网的诞生加速了信息的传播，部分人已经意识到大众传媒的弊端，他们主动打破信息和技术的壁垒，并因此从中受益，成为拥有自主权的个体。\n\n主权个体认为，勇于承担个人责任是通往自由和财富的道路。我们曾经处于一个标准化的社会，接受统一的教育，随大流高考/考研，进入大家公认的好单位，找到和你人生路基本相似的人，结婚生子，孩子继续重复这条道路... 这种标准化的生活方式让我们产生了依赖感，给了我们确定的道路和方向。但主权个体却不想将自己限制在这条看似为康庄大路的旅途上，他们通过主动寻求和筛选信息，跳出标准化的生活圈子，打造自己的游戏规则并建立杠杆，来实现财福双全的生活。\n\n他们不受民族和国家主义等意识形态的影响，而是名副其实的全球主义者。现在越来越多的工作可以在世界任何一个角落通过电脑来完成，对于主权个体来说，世界就是他们的游乐场，可以选择任何一个有利于他们发展的国家和地区，并打造多种收入来源，摆脱朝九晚五的限制。\n\n互联网本身已经形成了一个强大的经济体，并提供越来越多的沉浸式体验。主权个体可以利用互联网找到志同道合的人，不受地理位置限制联手合作开展项目（DAO），在数字环境中依靠智能合约达成协议，而不需要依靠当地政府的政策，从而实现多时区、多地区开拓收入来源，合理规避地缘政治的风险。\n\n看看今天社群内小伙伴的分享（下图），未来对于那些有理想有抱负的人来说总是充满着无限希望，勇敢地听从内心的引导去寻找属于你的社群，总会有一席之地供你闪亮！\n\n![Screenshot from the 1729 Discord community.](https://www.camelliayang.com/uploads/1/1/8/2/118233894/1729_orig.jpeg)\n\n## 创作者经济\n\n去年一直想参加[「创作者经济教母」](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/creator-economy-w)Li Jin的[线上课程](https://creatoreconomycourse.xyz/)，结果包括Spotify CEO在内的一众大佬都没排上号，当时默默地期待她能再开一次网课，未能如愿。\n\n最近Li Jin将她的网课免费向公众开放，虽然时隔一年有些内容已经过时，但绝大多数创作者经济相关联的底层逻辑总是万变不离其宗，简单总结一下我的学习笔记：\n\n\\- 如何定义「创作者」：有目的地创造可消费的内容，为自己和消费者创造价值；有影响力的人持续产出高质量的内容；数字时代的「邪教头目」，打造消费者可以产生共鸣的社群。\n\n\\- 纵观当前的创作者处境，Spotify上90%的流媒体播放版税给了前1.4%的音乐人，Twitch一半以上的营收都归于排名前1%的直播者，1%的主播囊括了大部分的播客广告收入。web2的互联网媒体模式压榨着绝大多数的创作者（尤其是中产创作者），使得他们的创作收益统统落入到平台的口袋中。\n\n\\- [a16z](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/va16zweb3)的创始人马克·安德森曾经提出过，互联网的原罪是没有将支付纳入其基础建设当中。这也解释了为什么web2盛行广告盈利的商业模式，与其让用户掏出信用卡付款，不如将他们的注意力变现。\n\n于是平台凭借着庞大的用户基数，利用算法控制着内容的创作和传播，将浏览量输送到已经备受欢迎的内容创作者那里。用户偏好和行为数据是平台最宝贵的资产，因此平台采取了封闭的生态系统，将用户锁定在自己的网络中，以便最大化收集这些专有数据。\n\n\\- 创作者在web2模式下不得不向广告商妥协，创造更能吸引眼球并带来流量的内容。这种模式不会激发创造小众而深入的内容，而是病毒式泛大众化的浅薄内容。\n\n以平台为中心、以广告为动力的商业模式是web2成功的关键，但是web3技术的诞生赋予了创作者更大的权利，并通过四大途径（NFT创造稀缺性、 用户/关注者成为投资人、有迹可循的新经济模式、 DAO和社区所有权）使创作者可以脱离平台的限制，直接建立与关注者和用户的关系。\n\n\\- 就像创业时需要找到产品和市场（PMF）的契合点，创作者也需要需要找到Creator-Market Fit，这时候需要考虑三个因素：商业模式、内容范围和受众。在探索商业模式时，需要回答几个问题（创作内容的动机、创作内容的平台、关注者的分类、内容种类、内容创造-变现的阶段、内容分发和推广平台）。\n\n\\- web2并没有一套奖励和跟踪机制系统，给予每一位参与创作的人应有的认可。而web3则解决了这个问题，以早期的Mirror和Foundation的分红功能为例，可以将收益自动分配给对该项目和作品有贡献的以太坊地址。\n\n互联网本身就是一个大熔炉，创作者们通过重混和合作的方式不断地产出内容并创造价值，这个曾经无法被量化和金融化的过程，如今借助技术可以统统实现，从而为创作者提供了更大的创作动力。每个链上项目和创意作品都有记录，创作者对其作品的后续使用也会获得相应的收益。\n\n\\- 创作者最大的焦虑：心理层面、算法层面和财务层面。创作者们最耗费心力的事情：寻找适合的工具和平台，寻找投资人获得增长。\n\n\\- 投资人在投资创作者时看重哪几个方面？创作者-市场契合度、有没有找到利基市场、是否为自己和消费者同时创造价值、增长趋势和盈利模式。投资人获取收益的方式：ISA、股份、代币、NFTs和借贷。\n\n\\- 现在最超前的那一部分人在周末所做的事情，就是普通人即将在未来十年从事的相关工作。现在孩子们热衷做的事情和项目，就是未来创作者会集中创作的东西。\n\n\\- 在过去的十年间，我们生活在一个内容所有权掌控在少数平台的环境里，这些平台拥有着我们的数据，操纵着创作者与用户的关系，并压榨着创作者的价值。虽然用户生产的内容迎来了一波又一波爆炸式的增长，但我们还是受限于算法和不正当激励机制的影响，绝大多数的创作者更不可能单凭创作内容谋生。\n\n幸运的是，我们正处于互联网复兴的起点，借助web3的技术将把我们带向一个真正的内容为王的黄金时代。\n\n*P.S.

如果你想要有安全感的生活，那你其实并不真的热爱生活。\n\n有安全感的生活是按照别人写好的剧本进行彩排。\n\n如果你能清晰地看到自己的人生轨迹，那并不是真正的人生，而是社会和环境强加给你的东西。\n\n人生就像穿越一条长长的隧道，看不到尽头且伴随着焦虑，而我们能做的就是把一路勇敢无畏前进的行动当做是自愿的行为，参与并体验整个过程。\n\n你的人生只有最后回顾时才能知晓。\n\n3\\. 克里希那穆提写道，学习自己是一件极其困难的事，因为自己处于持续不断的运动之中。要学习活生生的东西，你不得不每一分钟都以全新的视角来观察它和学习它。\n\n自己是一个活生生的实体，而不是一样已死的东西，这个活生生的东西必须得到观察。此外，你必须放下在这一分钟内所学到的有关你自己的知识，然后在下一分钟重新学习，以至于你一直都在以全新的视角来学习一个活生生的东西。\n\n[导师汤姆·摩根](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/21-useful-ideas-1-big-one-cn)也说过，我们追求的持续流动的平衡状态可以称之为「道」。可悲的是，这种平衡的状态却永远无法用精确的语言来阐述，因为一旦我们这样做了，「道」便被定义为静止的状态，这与「道」的定义相违背。\n\n认识自我的最好方式便是进入一种完全自发的无意识状态，与生命共舞实现流动的状态。你需要倾听自己的内心去找到实现这种状态的方法，没人能手把手教你，也不会靠模仿得来，全凭自己的感觉和体验。\n\n4\\. 今年三月份发现了一家聚焦[图书NFT的网站BookCoin](https://www.bookcoin.com/)，我很喜欢的博主[Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/)是该网站的顾问和参与方，并将其畅销书的金句做成了NFT在此网站发行。\n\n拥有Mark NFT的读者可以解锁图书未出版的章节，加入他的独家俱乐部和线上课程等。\n\n最近BookCoin又开始玩Read to earn模式，读者购买NFT之后可以在线阅读经典小说《The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde》，通过回答一系列和书籍内容有关的问题后，有机会获得限量版的NFT。感兴趣的可以研究下！\n\n\n---\n\nIf you love

{"id": "RRDGzOVosxO3BtGeJRid_gMWl1EOjFw22yhkULrkhdE", "title": "新手必学——Discord使用及撸毛指引", "body": "Twitter和Discord是了解加密货币项目和进入社区必备的两个软件，可以说，不会使用它们，甚至连撸空投的门都还没摸着。twitter的使用较为简单，基本不用了解就能上手，但是discord功能较为复杂，这里给大家做了一个快速指引，希望大家能够立刻上手，撸到大毛。\n\n## 一.Discord是什么\n\nDiscord最初是主要是面向游戏玩家的一个社区群聊通讯软件，与其他只有群聊和点对点通讯的聊天软件不同，Discord更像是集成了百度贴吧的群聊软件。\n\n由于Discord带有丰富的功能和拓展性，所以十分适合用来搭建项目方自己的社区，目前基本所有正经的项目方都会在discord上建立自己的社区，方便与社区成员沟通交流。\n\n[微软花120亿美金都高攀不起的Discord，到底有什么魔力？](https://www.163.com/dy/article/HAS91NK60511805E.html)\n\n[微软花120亿美金都高攀不起的Discord，到底有什么魔力？,微软,游戏,群组](https://www.163.com/dy/article/HAS91NK60511805E.html)\n\n[www.163.com](https://www.163.com/dy/article/HAS91NK60511805E.html)\n\n## 二.使用discord\n\n### 1.安装/插件\n\n首先我们从官网下周Discord。无论在什么时候，都一定要从官方网站安装软件，保护设备安全。\n\n[Discord | Your Place to Talk and Hang Out](https://discord.com/)\n\n[Discord is the easiest way to talk over voice, video, and text. Talk, chat, hang out, and stay close with your friends and communities.](https://discord.com/)\n\n[discord.com](https://discord.com/)\n\n打开软件后按照要求注册，这跟大多数app的注册是一样的，这里就不赘述了。\n\n由于大多数项目方都是使用英文交流的，所以可以自行安装一个翻译插件，这是第三方工具，可能存在一些风险，DYOR\n\n[【实用帖】手把手教你安装Discord翻译插件](https://mirror.xyz/0x7471e603a5e90136d678C919884048B227f5ba5D/6OaA9z8ae-2YVuCl5Jsl6N5SSdjvKf4nZAleoKalrGM)\n\n[mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/0x7471e603a5e90136d678C919884048B227f5ba5D/6OaA9z8ae-2YVuCl5Jsl6N5SSdjvKf4nZAleoKalrGM)\n\n### 2.进入discord\n\n如上图所示，进入discord后会看到这样一个界面：\n\n* **左侧红框区域为服务器列表**。这里的服务器不是我们平时说的机房里面的那种服务器，你可以理解为项目方自行建立的不同的论坛。\n* **黄框区域为服务器中的各个频道**。频道由服务器管理者自行设立，不同的频道有不同的功能。\n* **蓝框区域是个人设置选项**。点击自己的头像可以切换账号，点击名字可以直接复制自己的账号，注意每个人的账号后面还附带了一串数字，如果没有带上数字直接将账号告诉别人，是找不到你的，右侧的齿轮即设置选项，大多数功能可以不用管，但是可以定期查看一下已授权的app，防止无意中授权给了恶意app\n* **绿框区域是聊天界面**。\n* **白框区域是所在频道的人员列表**。点击人员头像可以看到他在服务器中的身份。身份可以说是discord的核心，下面也会详述。\n\n定期查看授权app是一个好习惯\n\n不同服务器需要使用链接或者discord内的朋友邀请才能进入，比如这样打开这个链接就能进入@AirdropToYou社区：[discord.gg/zFHwbfasdj](http://discord.gg/zFHwbfasdj)\n\n正经的项目方为了防止机器人大量涌入，会设置一个验证通道，进入Discord后，你一般只能看到verification频道，有的验证方式是点一下✅表情，有的需要点击Verify跳转到第三方验证网站，有的可能会通过私信（DM）给你发一个链接进行验证。\n\n点击Verify验证后才能进入服务器\n\n完成验证后就能看到大多数的频道了，有的服务器会需要关联你的钱包，这时你能找到Collab频道，进入后按照类似的方法给你的钱包签名。不用担心，collab是一个值得信任的项目，不存在安全问题。\n\n完成两项验证以后，首先要看的是服务器的公告了解整个服务器和项目的进展，一般项目方会在announcement/公告频道中公告所有内容，官方相关的链接会放在official-links中，还有一些，每进入一个频道都有一个钉注信息区域，频道中比较重要的内容会被放在这里，每次进入频道都应首先查看。\n\n添加的服务器太多后，会有巨量的通知信息，如果嫌太吵闹，可以点击服务器上方的小三角，关掉所有的消息通知。\n\n## 三.利用Discord撸毛\n\n### 1.拿身份\n\n身份是玩家在服务器中地位的象征，社区创建者除了给初创团队一些管理身份外，往往还会赋予早期玩家一个OG身份，对于那些擅长交流沟通、愿意为社区付出的志愿者也会给予Moderator（即我们常说的mod）身份，mod拥有禁言、踢人等许多管理权限。\n\n在Alps Finance社区中能看到各种各样的角色\n\n**在许多项目中，获得的身份越稀有，未来空投获得的代币也就越多。例如：**\n\n* **HOP**：0.1% 给前 500 名 Hop Discord 参与者和 79 名推特用户，他们是 Hop 的早期传播者\n* **ENS**：25% 给 ENS 贡献者（> 100 个个人和团体，加上数百名 Discord 用户）\n* **Swivel**：1% 属于经过验证的Discord 社区贡献者（经过验证的反馈和内容）\n\n因此，在DC中是否能够拿到重要的role身份，与你所能获得的空投量息息相关。\n\n**这里列举了几种拿到role的方法，供大家参考：**\n\n* **早期加入**：新项目刚开张的时候，OG（Original gangster）身份是比较容易拿的角色，在dc中人还不多的时候及时进入，完成一些任务即可获得。我曾经在推特多次推荐一些较优质的早期项目，及时进入都能获得OG。\n* **肝等级**：一般在社区中聊天越多，等级也会越高，相应也能获得不同的身份，Jambo是一个获得大量融资的非洲社交项目，现在去肝聊天，后期说不定就会得到不错的福报。如果决定肝等级的话一定要考察好项目，有的项目聊天机器人很多，项目方如果没仔细运营踢掉机器人的话，你会跟机器人内卷，那就得不偿失了。\n* **做任务**：一些项目如Singularity、Crypoto Maze会不定时发布一些任务，完成后就能获得积分或者角色。一些社区内的AMA也是可以多参加参加的，\n* **贡献**：普通人虽然无法完成开发工作，但是项目方往往会需要翻译，其实翻译的重点不在于英文有多好，借助DeelMind翻译工具，你可以直接获得一篇成色不错的英译中文章，最后所需要做的就是把语句改的更通顺，前段时间像OP、zkSync这样的大项目都一直需要翻译的，现在情况不太清楚，但是大家可以自行挖掘。\n\n### 2.套磁\n\n有些项目虽然不是很优质，但是项目方会比较好说好，这时你不一定要去混角色，多跟官方负责人或者管理员套磁聊天，说不定就能拿到一些白名单或者特别的信息。这个就完全考验个人的交际能力了。\n\n这里做个小广告，我们@AirdropToYou 社区目前正在招募宣发组，如果你有不错的交际能力，可以考虑加入我们社区，以宣发组的身份去跟项目方套磁，说不定能拿到更多的支持。\n\n[ \n ](https://discord.com/invite/zFHwbfasdj)", "timestamp": 1658561241, "digest": "sbrNSA_-i2O5YY7dbUWwBdry01WUx7tXpe6gdeFbuS4", "contributor": "0xa040B1D96957fC608C5801B2Aee9eF2d349334bB"}

Google Threat Analysis Group leader Shane Huntley [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1545449555231010816), “Blocking Office macros would do infinitely more to actually defend against real threats than all the threat intel blog posts.”\n\nNow the new default setting is rolling out, but with updated language to alert users and administrators what options they have when they try to open a file and it’s blocked. This only applies if Windows, using the NTFS file system, notes it as downloaded from the internet and not a network drive or site that admins have marked as safe, and it isn’t changing anything on other platforms like Mac, Office on Android / iOS, or Office on the web.\n\n**[Microsoft:](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/helping-users-stay-safe-blocking-internet-macros-by-default-in/ba-p/3071805/page/2)**\n\n> We’re resuming the rollout of this change in Current Channel.

第一节 引言\n\n如今电脑、手机等电子设备占据着生活生产大部分的时间，而软件作为电子屏幕中人际关系最重要的接口，扮演了非常重要的角色。电脑与智能手机的液晶屏幕背后，软件的世界变得越来越复杂而庞大。当今的生活生产形式在二十几年间，几乎已经被电子屏中的软件彻底颠覆了。软件这样一个虚拟世界似乎是一个平行的空间，给我们看世界的眼睛悄悄戴上了一幅眼镜。\n\n自从钻木取火开始，人类的进化就始终与工具的使用密不可分。当今世界普遍认为我们即将迎来新的技术革命，21世纪的技术被认为具备了智慧的可能性。在2018年的谷歌I/O大会上，谷歌董事长曾宣布他们的语音助手Duplex已经在商务领域通过了图灵测试。当天Duplex在大会上的演示确实为世人震惊，一时引发广泛讨论。然而没过多久就有人爆料称Duplex的语音服务有部分是人工代替。虽然事实的真像扑朔迷离，但诸如AlphaGo等智能产品的成功足以让人们担心或相信通过图灵测试的智能机器即将到来。于是诸如机器取代人类的言论铺天盖地，人们似乎并没有对技术的进一步进化做足充分的思想准备。\n\n这些恐慌都起源于人们的技术工具论思想。而软件作为当今信息技术最重要的载体，化身为各式各样的“工具”，嵌入进我们生活生产的方方面面。但是当我们使用这些软件工具的时候，却并不能引起“技术取代我们”的情绪。这其中的原因不仅仅是因为“锤子”不如“Duplex”先进，我们可能更因该思考他们之间的共性。正是基于这样的背景，我试图考察软件在使用的过程中，是如何中介着人与世界的关系。对软件操作如何影响我们感知事物的研究，或许也许可以帮助我们理解自身与技术之间的关系问题。本研究将聚焦于软件操作带来的一些认知惯性如何影响我们的在现实生活中的感知。\n\n### 第二节 研究目标与意义\n\n当今世界的电子技术与信息技术已成为生产生活最重要的基础设施，而软件作为人与电子实体的中间层，决定了我们日常生活形式的方方面面。研究人与软件交互中带来的知觉层面的影响，将可以为人与技术的关系的思考与艺术实践提供有价值的灵感与养分。\n\n本文受限于篇幅和作者的知识背景，将侧重在对功能性软件奥多比系列和社交软件抖音的交互的具体情境进行分析。并结合相关艺术案例，来探讨软件自身的交互逻辑是如何作用于人，艺术家们又该如何回应？\n\n### 第三节 人与技术的关系\n\n柏拉图早在《斐徳罗篇》中就有对书写作为一种记忆技术的思考。书写在拓展我们记忆能力的同时，是否使我们失去了记忆的能力呢？这种技术的二重性也体现在希腊神话中，爱比米修斯在给万物分发能力的时候遗漏了人类，普罗米修斯为了弥补他的过失为人类偷来了火种。然而在人类享用“火”这一技术的同时，普罗米修斯不得不替人类日夜受罚。这些古老的思想和传说显示出技术的进步始终伴随着痛楚，并且人类总是遗忘技术诞生的原始起因。 海德格尔在其演讲录《技术的追问》中专门讨论过技术的本质的问题。人们通常对技术的看法是将工具与其发展的目的的分离的，技术是人的行为，其本身是中立的。然而海德格尔认为技术演化发展的背后，隐含着一种将一切自然之物变为有待备用的“持存物”的本质。人在发明和使用技术的同时，获得了一种自由假象。而这种对技术的起源之遗忘，也导致了认为技术仅仅是达到目的的手段这样一种工具论的认识。\n\n唐·伊德在《技术与生活世界》这本书中，将人与技术的关系放在一个图形与背景/生物与环境/宏观知觉与微观知觉的框架下来审视。基于此他为人与技术的关系提出了一个四象限的框架。他认为人与技术的关系分为具身关系（embodiment relations）、诠释学关系(hermeneutic relations)、它异关系（alterity relations）和背景关系(background relations)。“具身关系”是一种非常切身的与技术的关系。例如眼镜和视觉的关系，是“我以一种特殊的使用方式将技术融入我的经验中”的情景，唐·伊德用“（人-技术）→世界”的意向图式来表示。“诠释学关系”是技术成为了我们理解世界的中介，因为技术我们才对世界获得了某种认知。比如说因为有了温度计我们才知道现在的温度是多少，意向图式为“人→（技术-世界）”。“它异关系”是技术成为了一个准它者（quasi-other）。唐·伊德用ATM机来举例，意向图式为“人-技术-（-世界）”。第四种关系是 “背景关系”。此时技术从具体的使用中隐去，成为一种背景。比如无线网络这样的技术，我们在使用它的时候感受不到它的存在，只有断网的时候才能体会到它。\n\n这些关系不是割裂的而是同时交叉存在于人与技术的关系中。唐·伊德认为人在与技术交互时，技术同时兼备一种“放大-简化”人的能力的作用，就如同望远镜延伸了我们的视觉极限，但同时也将我们的认识简化到了纯视觉的范围内。某种程度上，这也呼应了海德格尔的技术同时解蔽/遮蔽了世界的观点，并重新以生活世界的视角来解释。这种辩证的二重性并不同于通常人们所说的“技术是把双刃剑”。“双刃剑”的理论仍然是将目的与手段分裂开的想法，否认了技术与人的互相形塑的本质。唐伊德的分析是将人与技术放在一个生存论的关系中来思考的，我认为唐伊德着重生活世界的经验分析有利于在实践层面上来面对人与技术的本质这一问题，特别是在艺术实践的角度颇有启发。\n\n### 第四节 软件与界面（接口）\n\n计算机作为一种只能读取“0/1”这种电位信号的计算设备，为了提高操作效率，人类发明了各种更容易理解的符号语言来对计算机输入指令以代替去直接操作电路面板。这些符号语言发展到当今，已经变得非常“高级”或者说“用户友好”。比如更接近自然语言的“高级编程语言”以及“图形用户界面”。虽然诸如编程语言的“if…else”或者图形界面的“点击”、“拖拽”行为，看起来如此自然，容易理解，但实际上，这只不过是经由工程师将电位级别的指令规则层层抽象之后形成的一个幻象。软件就是这样一个相对于计算机底层逻辑操作的抽象的隐喻，以人类高效操作计算机为目的，并且独立于具体的硬件。\n\n如果我们将这样一座层层抽象的“巴别塔”剖开来看，每一层都可比作上一层的“软件”，编程语言之下有编译器/解释器、编译器/解释器之下有汇编语言、汇编语言之下有机器码以及指令集等等。而被工程师称为“用户（user）”的图形界面使用者，则处在这条如俄罗斯套娃一般，自相似递归链条的最末端。虽然从本质上来看，每一层都可以称作相对于上一层的软件，但作为使用者的“用户（user）”和作为书写者/定义者的“开发者（developer）”是不同的。开发者为用户开发界面/接口（interface），用户通过界面/接口使用硬件；开发者拥有比用户更多的定义权和知情权，用户更加被动地通过界面/接口的隐喻来理解计算机；开发者通过书写来与计算机沟通，用户通过对视觉符号联想来操作计算机。作为开发者的“书写”是一个大的话题，而本篇文章则侧重讨论用户与界面/接口的交互现象。虽然界面/接口不仅仅指代软件中的界面，在硬件中也存在，比如说一个耳机的插孔在英文中也被称为interface（接口）。但在中文的语境里界面通常和接口有所区分，界面更多的是虚拟的图形界面，比较相近的英文概念是图形用户界面（Graphic User Interface）。而在当今世界的生活中，图形用户界面涵盖了人们使用软件的绝大多是场景，因此本片文章的重点也是放在了对图形用户界面的分析上。\n\n## 第二章 软件操作的两个情景\n\n### 第一节 计算机辅助绘图\n\n#### **知识经验与日常经验**\n\n手掌以下两个手指的地方，也叫寸口，是长度单位。当我们想要找出正确的垂直线的时候，我们用线吊起一个重物，地心引力给手施加的压力感，以及有关万有引力的知识，让你有信心认为这根线一定是垂直指向地面的。这些“原始”的测量活动中，身体的感知必不可少。然而科学与理性的发展，让我们的脑海中多了一些超越经验范畴的知识。在墨家的《经》与欧几里得的《几何原本》中对“线”的描述有相似的地方。“端，体之无厚而最前者也”（《经》，墨子），“端，是无间”（《经说》），“点是没有的部分”（《几何原本》，欧几里得）。这些几何的概念让我们对事物的尺度具备了一种极限的认知与感悟。随着计算机辅助设计（CAD）等相关的工具软件的诞生，“点”、“线”、“面”这些原本抽象且极限的概念，在电脑中却可以以一种数学与视觉的方式显现。不仅如此，这些辅助工具还预置了让我们的设计更加完美高效的程序。比如贝塞尔曲线、B样条等算法，会根据我们实际绘制的折线，预测并描画出具有极高精度的平滑曲线。从那时开始，那些超出我们身体经验之外的精确与完美的形式，已经内化到我们的直觉中了。\n\n在人使用工具的过程中，基于科学的软件工具的发明，将那些数学几何的认知方式嵌入到了我们的身体意识当中。使得我们观察和绘图的过程中，添加了一个中间层。计算机辅助绘图软件就是这样一种中间层，下面将会以奥多比的绘图软件为例来讨论计算机辅助绘图中的人机交互关系。\n\n#### **奥多比公司的绘图工具**\n\n与计算机绘图软件起始与伊万·萨瑟兰（Ivan Sutherland）的一篇博士论文《画板》（sketchpad）（1963）。 画板（sketchpad）被认为是计算机辅助设计（CAD)的始祖。在还没有鼠标和键盘这些现代电脑标配的交互套件的时代，画板（sketchpad）这套系统就具备了非常流畅的电脑绘图交互。画板（sketchpad）可以通过“光笔”（一种光敏输入设备），可以在屏幕上绘制几何图形。并且对几个图形的各部分属性可以进行任意改动。复制、粘贴、长度修改、对齐、对称、夹角度数等等几何性质都可以精确控制，并且可以在有限的屏幕尺寸内，无线的放大和缩小图形。这项发明在当时是非常突破性的，伊万·萨瑟兰（Ivan Sutherland）博士被认为是人机交互（HCI）学科的开创人，绘图程序sketchpad的图形用户界面和面向对象的编程方法被认为是计算机图形学的重大突破。实际上，Sutherland博士凭借这篇论文成功获得了1988年的图灵奖。也正是这一年，奥多比（Adobe）公司的Illustrator桌面绘图软件正是发布了。\n\n图 1 Sketchpad， 1963\n\n《画板》（sketchpad）作为第一个图形用户界面和第一个交互式绘图程序，影响了后面的许多重要软件，奥多比的Illustrator（Adobe Illustrator）就是其中发展最好的软件之一。奥多比（Adobe）公司创始人约翰·沃诺克（John Warnock）在Evans and Sutherland公司工作的时候（Ivan Sutherland和Evans创办的著名的计算机图形公司）开始了PostScript编程语言的想法。这个技术后来成为了奥多比（Adobe）公司早期的核心技术。苹果公司的乔布斯看中奥多比（Adobe）公司的技术，并用在了苹果与佳能合作的激光打印机LaserWrite上。自从1988年Adobe Illustrator在麦金塔电脑上发布开始，电脑绘图和数字打印输出就完美的结合起来了。桌面绘图软件Illustrator，苹果麦金塔电脑和鼠标键盘，佳能的激光打印机。这一整套的工作流水线，颠覆了传统绘图和印刷出版的模式，开创了以电脑和打印机为中心的桌面出版的模式。而奥多比（Adobe）系列软件也成为了现代平面设计不可或缺的必备工作套件。从那时开始，设计绘图就从尺规手绘变成了用鼠标在屏幕上调整贝塞尔曲线。这样的模式，一直延续到现在。\n\n在前文中我们已经提到过，几何的知识，让我们具备了超越日常经验之上的认知。而这些从墨子和欧几里得发源的几何的理性知识，经由现代科学的演化，逐渐具体化成为了屏幕中的操作界面。Illustrator工具栏上琳琅满目的工具图标，虽然有着具象化的，甚至是拟物风格的图标，让你产生对生活世界中的铅笔、钢笔等工具的联想认知，但实际上他们千差万别。\n\n在Illustrator中所有的曲线绘制都是基于贝塞尔曲线算法的。当你试图用AI Illustrator）画点儿什么，即使你使用最简单的铅笔功能，Illustrator都会直接用贝塞尔的曲线对这条路径进行重新绘制。然后你可以用“直接选择”工具来调整每一个控制点。这条重绘的曲线损失了一些原作者的精确细节，但它使线条变得更完美、更符合标准的工业流程。它增强了我们对形状和线条的控制力。而复制、平移、翻转、镜像、透视变形、风格笔刷等等，更加增强了这一属性。正如Illustrator 1.0上市使用的品牌形象《维纳斯的诞生》（波提切利）一样，“让你创造完美的曲线”是Illustrator的立足之本。\n\n绘画是们古老的艺术，心、手和眼的密切配合中有着很多不可分割的相互作用过程，这决定了电脑辅助绘图将是一个高度具身化的技术。在与计算机绘图软件的发展中，数位绘画板应运而生。值得一提的是。数位板的发明实际上远早于绘图程序、乃至计算机的发明。早在1888年，伊莱莎·格雷（Elisha Gray）就发明了电传笔（如图表6），可以被认为是在电报时代用来签名的机器。现代的数位笔，如和冠(Wacom)数位笔，与其技术形式是十分相似的，他们都是将人工轨迹转换成电信号传输到电子系统来。只不过现代数位笔的无线无源技术，采用一种更自然，巧妙的技术形式。如和冠(Wacom)的数位笔使用电磁场来进行电子笔的状态探测，无需供电，就可以将笔的倾斜、压感等信息传递给电脑。使电子绘图的体验进一步逼近真实的纸笔绘图。\n\n数位板、数位笔与奥多比系列软件整合起来的数位出版工作方式，提高了出版物生产的效率，同时也促成了出版图画的新的时尚。用Illustrator绘制的图形既漂亮美观，又能高效产出，迅速风靡。电脑绘图的“自然化”实际上是唐·伊德意义上技术的具身化的加强，技术更好的化身为了人类的能力的一部分，变得更加透明化。这也使得人在使用工具的时候更不觉得工具的存在，与此同时，人的技术带来的感知能力也更加内化为人的感知。使用者可以画出更完美的曲线，更精准的造型，更完美的重复与按比例变化的细节。\n\n技术的透明度一方面让技术本身“抽身而去”，使用者在绘制的过程中忘记了工具的存在，另一方面让我们相信并依靠自己被增强的技能。绘图软件中种类繁多的微自动功能，给绘图者形象思维中植入了数学的模型。这些来自工具的逻辑不断内化到使用者的行为和想象中。\n\n谷歌人工智能实验室的日本员工在其网站上发布一个书写汉字的小实验Kanji-rnn。该实验使用了具有短期记忆的神经网络模型，通过大量将汉字的路径喂给模型，他就可以形成一个对汉字结构的模糊概念。在这个项目的线上互动展示项目上，你可以通过鼠标输入汉字的部分笔画，Kanji-rnn会实时地预测接下来的笔画，完成汉字书写。虽然这个项目并没有什么特别的研究目标，仅仅是为了实验模型的可能性。该模型只是借用表面的字形模式，并没有真正理解汉字的字形组成的内涵意义。但是类似通过路径预测的方式，如果放在警方判断犯罪行为上，则可以形成强有力的决策行为。实际上这样的方法已经发生在了现实之中。而这些更具自主性的数学模型与AI中为自动化的路径预测有着同源的亲近关系。\n\n在Illustrator的使用情景中，使用者不仅仅是通过软件来完成自己的工作，同时也在软件提供的功能框架下，逐渐形成了与软件相互镶嵌的技巧与艺术语言。软件并不是中立的，软件实际参与了绘图方法甚至设计方式的建立。在这一直觉关系中，软件不仅具有具身性，同时也有它异性。具身性增强了控制几何元素的能力，同时也将使用者的心与手的可能性简化到了数学模型的范围。而繁多且不断完善的微自动功能，也让软件具有了某种能动性， 亦即主体性。\n\nIllustrator软件是计算机辅助绘图中的一种，作为奥多比（Adobe）公司的头号产品之一，如今非常密切的参与着平面类型的创意图形的输出，包括平面设计、插画、二维动画等。作为艺术创意领域的辅助设计软件，相比如工业领域的诸如AutoCAD、犀牛等软件来说，Illustrator的软件逻辑和操作使用相对来说更加人性化，或者说有更好的“用户体验”。在界面设计领域，当说一个软件有比较好的用户体验的时候，一般是认为这个软件使用起来有比较低的学习门槛和比较直觉化的操作逻辑。“较低的学习门槛”可以被认为是软件的各部分功能和使用逻辑与用户在现实世界的经验有更多的重合。“更符合直觉的使用逻辑”是指软件的使用方法能够最大效率地是通过界面的暗示传达给用户。就使用者的感受来说，会让人感觉软件更好“上手”，觉得很好用。\n\n软件技术不仅仅是中立的工具和手段。在人与软件的交互过程中，技术依循自身的逻辑，或改造、或扩充我们的知觉，同时也选择性的简化某些认知能力。软件的自身逻辑，是其发展中的它异化的体现，逐渐发展为具有主体性的关系。在推动技术发展的过程中，我们应该密切关注技术给我们带来的影响，从而更好的让技术和我们成为合作者的而关系，而不是反噬或对立。\n\n### 第二节 抖音App的体验闭环\n\n互动体验设计是网联网产品设计的一个专业领域，其核心目标是如何使软件产品更好用。但这样的目标在一些免费的产品中，却显得有悖其初衷。从利益或者说从根本上的商业逻辑上来考虑，用户和流量就是金钱。所以免费软件的经营者和产品经理们不得不绞尽脑汁的来拉拢近的用户并促进用户活跃度，行话称其为“拉新”和“促活”。在这样的大背景下，被称为用户的软件使用者们，行为上瘾在所难免。免费的软件实际上并不免费。\n\n免费经济带来的软件沉迷是值得反思和探讨的，在这一章中我讲探讨抖音app为例，来探讨社交类软件是如何构建起不断吸引用户使用的体验闭环的。\n\n#### **那些欲罢不能的功能**\n\n在社交类的软件的互动设计中，有许多让人“上瘾”的功能，比如facebook发明的点赞，youtube的自动播放下一条视频，app来新消息时的小红点，粉丝量，等等。者每一项发明的背后几乎有着心理学的原理，利用人们的心理弱点，来让用户不假思索地产生行动。著名学者普林斯顿心理学博士亚当 · 阿尔特（Adam Alter）曾提出了“行为上瘾”的概念，并列举了行为上瘾的六项相关构成要素，分别是：\n\n1. 诱人的目标\n2. 无法抵挡且无法预知的积极反馈\n3. 渐进改善的感觉\n4. 越来越困难的任务\n5. 需要解决却暂未解决的紧张感\n6. 强大的社会联系\n   抖音则全部满足了以上要求。如自动推荐的内容，让用户始终无法预知下一个视频的内容，始终保持好奇、滑动屏幕的时候自动播放、15秒配有动感音乐的短视频与自动播放、和点赞社交的激励。其中功能大多都有相应的神经学或者脑科学的理论的成果支持。如间歇性变量奖励（自动推荐）、先于理智的音乐与视觉刺激（自动播放）、蔡格尼克记忆效应（Zeigarnik effect）（15秒视频的意犹未尽）等等。基于抖音软件的音乐短视频的内容和其产品理念“记录美好生活”，抖音在基于以上设计之中主要强化的了沉浸式瀑布流的交互形式，接下来我将主要分析抖音主界面的瀑布流交互。", "timestamp": 1658562727, "digest": "IQWHeAmue_yqt5PVSwtOf5eEKcN6lG7MubslmE8UA5c",

The European Union has pledged to[ reduce its Russian gas consumption by 66%](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/18/energy/europe-repower-plan-russian-energy/index.html) before next year, and break its dependence completely by 2027.\n\n* \n\nOn Wednesday, the bloc unveiled its emergency gas rationing plan which sets a target for member states to reduce their gas demand by 15% between August and March next year.\n\n— *Nadine Schmidt contributed reporting.*", "timestamp": 1658562721, "digest": "LDiQZTo4_o8oNYmIb48waplDk8akeavuSWFkaz1aYC8", "contributor": "0xBCFf79e650DcAe9A9fb61AC0Adf39ff3C901610c"}

{"id": "rdPqYq3bsMsNXj8ekjEXXo51rBb3-kvx1ezHoYWzp8E", "title": "周末情绪和价格仍保持窄幅震荡 宏观情况尚未出现明显变化 — 2022.7.23", "body": "当前总结：从美股闭盘后BTC和ETH就开始了一路上涨，到目前将近下午14点，依然是在震荡上行的趋势，从现在的情况来看最起码这个周末是安全的，这也符合当前的宏观逻辑，毕竟还没有发生任何实质性的改变，这也是一直在强调的。但下周三就会公布七月的加息计划，周四凌晨就会公布美国第二季度的GDP。\n\n然后再8月10日就会出炉7月份的CPI，所以时间还是相对比较紧。尤其是从昨天开始，美股方面已经开始炒作下周三的加息已经不仅仅是75和100的博弈，甚至已经出现了50个基点的可能，之前就和大家聊过，这次加息不论是75个基点还是100个基点，不论是否Price in（预期）都必然会对美金指数和情绪造成冲击。\n\n所以75和100都会造成利空的效应，只是多少的问题，但是加息50就完全变了，虽然也会对美金指数造成冲击，但是更大的影响在于50个基点等于是美联储变相的承认了美国经济的衰退，并且从七月开始就做好了转向的准备，而通胀是否见顶都已经不重要了，毕竟这次的问题是出在供应链上。\n\n而加息只是通过经济衰退来减少购买力，从而用降低购买力的方式来降低通胀，而经济衰退是当前的民主党所不愿意承受的，毕竟中期大选就在这里。而如果剧本真的是按照这样来走的话，经济派就会短期内大获全胜，但通胀必然会越来越高，接下来的时间自然会迎来更猛烈的反扑，但起码不是现在需要考虑的了。\n\n在这种炒作下，美股在周三公布加息数据前基本不会走的太难看，经过一个周末的炒作，周一开盘后就能看到结果了。但距离周三还是有些短，虽然短期可以提升经济派的士气，但如果没有实现加息50个基点，那么对于周内入场的投资者将会出现较大的士气打击，虽然目前来看75仍然是最大的可能。\n\nTwitter @ Phyrex_Ni\n\n截止到今天下午13点30分的BTC持仓价格分布，可以看到很大的不同，尤其是在极端价格下的情况，虽然获取数据的时间相较工作日长了5个小时，但远古持仓的BTC发生的离场数据超过了正常范围的一倍，甚至超过了近期平均值的两倍以上，而且从分布情况来看，并不像是交易所的行为，更像是用户的抛售。\n\n应该是获利用户看到BTC的价格出现了下行的趋势，担心加息和GDP发布后会造成更大的打击，甚至会担心周末发生之前崩盘的情况，所以选择提前离场，这也是目前通胀派所最担心的问题，不过就目前来看，本周末崩盘的情况几乎是不会发生了。另外就是高位套牢的BTC也出现了大量的减持。\n\n但与远古持仓的获利筹码不同，高位套牢的BTC离场主要是集中在60,000美金和62,000美金左右，尤其是62,000美金出现了高达18,600枚BTC的一次性减持，通过交叉对比来看，这两笔总量超过20,000枚BTC的减持更大的可能性还是来自于交易所的互转，并不会对价格产生冲击，而真正高位套牢筹码的减持仅200余枚。\n\n目前最大的抛压依然是围绕着当前的争端价格，尤其是BTC的价格出现了短期难以上冲的趋势，但是在ETH继续强势的情况下，BTC的走势必然会受到ETH的影响，更多的BTC也会通过汇率切换到ETH，所以获利筹码的减持继续占有更大的比重，更多的筹码也在向当前的争端价格汇聚。\n\n当前18,000美金至23,000美金之间的BTC存量已经超过了270万枚，而且该数据必然会随着BTC价格的窄幅震荡而继续增加，这是目前来看最有可能不利的局面，虽然这些筹码并不会全部都是在用户手里，但那怕只有20%至30%是被用户掌握的，那么一旦发生情绪崩溃，40,000美金和30,000美金的倾泻行为都有可能会重演。\n\n从转移到交易所的BTC日线数据可以看到，抛压进入到了下行的趋势，这一方面是说明了获利筹码在大量的减持后准备出售的剩余量已经不够多了，毕竟近期的价格是在震荡上行，20,000美金以内的筹码完全无法得到补充，必然是卖一枚少一枚，而另一方面也说明了窄幅的震荡上行和通胀的预期给了持有者信心。\n\n并不急于去将少量盈利或者亏损的筹码出售，可以在加息前再多观察一下。从细节数据上可以看到，在凌晨的美股闭盘后直至今天上午的11点之前BTC的抛压确实在增加，但在11点之后，抛压量就在持续的下降，所以我们可以知道，今天并不是没有出现小动作，只是动作太小了，以至于被足够的资金吞没了。\n\n从转出交易所的提现数据也可以看到，虽然提现离场的BTC也随着抛压而减少，但依然可以覆盖住所有的抛压，甚至还有不少的盈余，可以提走交易所之前的存量，而且从细节数据来看，虽然不是完全消耗了美股闭盘后的抛压，但也阻击了抛压的主力，使得价格开始回升，购买力也是在中午11点达到了巅峰。\n\n在交易所的BTC存量数据可以清晰的看到，截止到今天早晨八点前，交易所的库存是在持续降低的，而细节数据显示，从凌晨一点开始就出现了更多的筹码转入，虽然后续的资金在持续的消耗这部分的筹码，但仍然有部分的BTC或主动或被动的滞留在了交易所，寻找更合适的机会和价格离场。\n\n通过ETH转入转出交易所的数据可以看到，虽然ETH的购买力和价格依然是保持强势的状态，甚至又力压BTC实现领涨盘面，但筹码的抛压并没有继续下降，这代表着周末确实容易引发恐慌的联想，但目前来看这个周末不会出现大规模的抛压，所以ETH的增长幅度还是不错的，尤其周末少量资金就可以拉盘。\n\n而从ETH的交易所存量来看，虽然存量有上升的趋势，但是细节数据表明最近两天基本就是处于水平的状态，也就是说转入的抛压和购买力几乎达到了一致，但价格的上涨代表了更多的筹码并不急于离场而是等待更好的时机。另外就是Gemini产生的190万枚ETH转出已经被判断是交易所的新钱包，所以该数值会被补回。\n\n从目前资金的情况来看，欧洲的小伙伴果然还是挺不错的，随着欧洲的加息，欧元开始和美元争夺汇率，而且欧洲对应的国债利率也有部分的提升，但是因为欧洲各个国家的经济水平差距较大，偿付能力参差不齐，甚至是欧股也在加息的带动下出现下跌的情况，所以更多的资金进入美债和风险市场也是正常的。\n\n相对于USDT资金量开始上升，处于风口浪尖的美国人还是比较谨慎，但USDC的购买力虽然没有回复到年初的高水平，但是相对最近两周来说，也勉强可以及格了，尤其是USDT的做空失败后，USDT汇率已经反超。但是相对于USDT的市值完全没有增加来说，USDC最近每天都在增加数千万美金的市值，说明有资金通过USDC回归。\n\n从目前近48小时的BTC和ETH的整体抛压以及USDT和USDC的交易所转入购买力对比来看，从下午14点开始抛压虽然是在逐渐的减少，但是购买力并没有显著的上升，目前已经到了15点左右，暂时还没有发现来自于欧洲的资金，但毕竟是周末相对也是挺正常的，不过从形势上来看，ETH继续处于领导的地位。\n\n当前的BTC永续合约的情况来看，资金费率已经从全面的看多，变为了质疑阶段，看多看空在持续的变化，这不仅仅是出于对周末的担心，更多的还是随着美联储加息的临近对于后市的不看好，尤其是最近公布的数据来看，通胀见顶的言论受到的打击也越来越多，但相对来说经济问题更加严重。\n\n目前宏观上继续没有太大的变化，美金指数继续和欧元的汇率博弈，维持窄幅震荡，资金的博弈也是在经济派和通胀派之间摇摆，目前来看3%的殖利率是一个争夺点。而两年期的美债利率继续和十年期的利率发生倒挂，而且差距在逐步的扩大，目前再次超过22个基点，经济的衰退几乎是难以避免。\n\n这也是传出美联储有可能加息50个基点的原因，虽然可能性并不大，但也代表了更多的投资者认为美联储需要转向了。大众也逐渐明白，目前因为供应链导致的通胀，通过加息抑制只能是带来经济的衰退。", "timestamp": 1658563052, "digest": "2W0MNFvw53e58D7X7H515JkncklSqhlLSlkTKbOCxTc", "contributor": "0xdDa424d9bB3140bE68b0AAadCaf7CADf7c36A046"}
{"id": "RrWziyl-uupiiMQL1SIcD5df9zgONZO4QySOSpqBK9E", "title": "屏幕内外——论软件操作与日常知觉的影响(On-screen and off-screen——on the impact of software operation on life-world perceptions", "body": "## 第一章 导论\n\n### 第一节 引言\n\n如今电脑、手机等电子设备占据着生活生产大部分的时间，而软件作为电子屏幕中人际关系最重要的接口，扮演了非常重要的角色。电脑与智能手机的液晶屏幕背后，软件的世界变得越来越复杂而庞大。当今的生活生产形式在二十几年间，几乎已经被电子屏中的软件彻底颠覆了。软件这样一个虚拟世界似乎是一个平行的空间，给我们看世界的眼睛悄悄戴上了一幅眼镜。\n\n自从钻木取火开始，人类的进化就始终与工具的使用密不可分。当今世界普遍认为我们即将迎来新的技术革命，21世纪的技术被认为具备了智慧的可能性。在2018年的谷歌I/O大会上，谷歌董事长曾宣布他们的语音助手Duplex已经在商务领域通过了图灵测试。当天Duplex在大会上的演示确实为世人震惊，一时引发广泛讨论。然而没过多久就有人爆料称Duplex的语音服务有部分是人工代替。虽然事实的真像扑朔迷离，但诸如AlphaGo等智能产品的成功足以让人们担心或相信通过图灵测试的智能机器即将到来。于是诸如机器取代人类的言论铺天盖地，人们似乎并没有对技术的进一步进化做足充分的思想准备。\n\n这些恐慌都起源于人们的技术工具论思想。而软件作为当今信息技术最重要的载体，化身为各式各样的“工具”，嵌入进我们生活生产的方方面面。但是当我们使用这些软件工具的时候，却并不能引起“技术取代我们”的情绪。这其中的原因不仅仅是因为“锤子”不如“Duplex”先进，我们可能更因该思考他们之间的共性。正是基于这样的背景，我试图考察软件在使用的过程中，是如何中介着人与世界的关系。对软件操作如何影响我们感知事物的研究，或许也许可以帮助我们理解自身与技术之间的关系问题。本研究将聚焦于软件操作带来的一些认知惯性如何影响我们的在现实生活中的感知。\n\n### 第二节 研究目标与意义\n\n当今世界的电子技术与信息技术已成为生产生活最重要的基础设施，而软件作为人与电子实体的中间层，决定了我们日常生活形式的方方面面。研究人与软件交互中带来的知觉层面的影响，将可以为人与技术的关系的思考与艺术实践提供有价值的灵感与养分。\n\n本文受限于篇幅和作者的知识背景，将侧重在对功能性软件奥多比系列和社交软件抖音的交互的具体情境进行分析。并结合相关艺术案例，来探讨软件自身的交互逻辑是如何作用于人，艺术家们又该如何回应？\n\n### 第三节 人与技术的关系\n\n柏拉图早在《斐徳罗篇》中就有对书写作为一种记忆技术的思考。书写在拓展我们记忆能力的同时，是否使我们失去了记忆的能力呢？这种技术的二重性也体现在希腊神话中，爱比米修斯在给万物分发能力的时候遗漏了人类，普罗米修斯为了弥补他的过失为人类偷来了火种。然而在人类享用“火”这一技术的同时，普罗米修斯不得不替人类日夜受罚。这些古老的思想和传说显示出技术的进步始终伴随着痛楚，并且人类总是遗忘技术诞生的原始起因。 海德格尔在其演讲录《技术的追问》中专门讨论过技术的本质的问题。人们通常对技术的看法是将工具与其发展的目的的分离的，技术是人的行为，其本身是中立的。然而海德格尔认为技术演化发展的背后，隐含着一种将一切自然之物变为有待备用的“持存物”的本质。人在发明和使用技术的同时，获得了一种自由假象。而这种对技术的起源之遗忘，也导致了认为技术仅仅是达到目的的手段这样一种工具论的认识。\n\n唐·伊德在《技术与生活世界》这本书中，将人与技术的关系放在一个图形与背景/生物与环境/宏观知觉与微观知觉的框架下来审视。基于此他为人与技术的关系提出了一个四象限的框架。他认为人与技术的关系分为具身关系（embodiment relations）、诠释学关系(hermeneutic relations)、它异关系（alterity relations）和背景关系(background relations)。“具身关系”是一种非常切身的与技术的关系。例如眼镜和视觉的关系，是“我以一种特殊的使用方式将技术融入我的经验中”的情景，唐·伊德用“（人-技术）→世界”的意向图式来表示。“诠释学关系”是技术成为了我们理解世界的中介，因为技术我们才对世界获得了某种认知。比如说因为有了温度计我们才知道现在的温度是多少，意向图式为“人→（技术-世界）”。“它异关系”是技术成为了一个准它者（quasi-other）。唐·伊德用ATM机来举例，意向图式为“人-技术-（-世界）”。第四种关系是 “背景关系”。此时技术从具体的使用中隐去，成为一种背景。比如无线网络这样的技术，我们在使用它的时候感受不到它的存在，只有断网的时候才能体会到它。\n\n这些关系不是割裂的而是同时交叉存在于人与技术的关系中。唐·伊德认为人在与技术交互时，技术同时兼备一种“放大-简化”人的能力的作用，就如同望远镜延伸了我们的视觉极限，但同时也将我们的认识简化到了纯视觉的范围内。某种程度上，这也呼应了海德格尔的技术同时解蔽/遮蔽了世界的观点，并重新以生活世界的视角来解释。这种辩证的二重性并不同于通常人们所说的“技术是把双刃剑”。“双刃剑”的理论仍然是将目的与手段分裂开的想法，否认了技术与人的互相形塑的本质。唐伊德的分析是将人与技术放在一个生存论的关系中来思考的，我认为唐伊德着重生活世界的经验分析有利于在实践层面上来面对人与技术的本质这一问题，特别是在艺术实践的角度颇有启发。\n\n### 第四节 软件与界面（接口）\n\n计算机作为一种只能读取“0/1”这种电位信号的计算设备，为了提高操作效率，人类发明了各种更容易理解的符号语言来对计算机输入指令以代替去直接操作电路面板。这些符号语言发展到当今，已经变得非常“高级”或者说“用户友好”。比如更接近自然语言的“高级编程语言”以及“图形用户界面”。虽然诸如编程语言的“if…else”或者图形界面的“点击”、“拖拽”行为，看起来如此自然，容易理解，但实际上，这只不过是经由工程师将电位级别的指令规则层层抽象之后形成的一个幻象。软件就是这样一个相对于计算机底层逻辑操作的抽象的隐喻，以人类高效操作计算机为目的，并且独立于具体的硬件。\n\n如果我们将这样一座层层抽象的“巴别塔”剖开来看，每一层都可比作上一层的“软件”，编程语言之下有编译器/解释器、编译器/解释器之下有汇编语言、汇编语言之下有机器码以及指令集等等。而被工程师称为“用户（user）”的图形界面使用者，则处在这条如俄罗斯套娃一般，自相似递归链条的最末端。虽然从本质上来看，每一层都可以称作相对于上一层的软件，但作为使用者的“用户（user）”和作为书写者/定义者的“开发者（developer）”是不同的。开发者为用户开发界面/接口（interface），用户通过界面/接口使用硬件；开发者拥有比用户更多的定义权和知情权，用户更加被动地通过界面/接口的隐喻来理解计算机；开发者通过书写来与计算机沟通，用户通过对视觉符号联想来操作计算机。作为开发者的“书写”是一个大的话题，而本篇文章则侧重讨论用户与界面/接口的交互现象。虽然界面/接口不仅仅指代软件中的界面，在硬件中也存在，比如说一个耳机的插孔在英文中也被称为interface（接口）。但在中文的语境里界面通常和接口有所区分，界面更多的是虚拟的图形界面，比较相近的英文概念是图形用户界面（Graphic User Interface）。而在当今世界的生活中，图形用户界面涵盖了人们使用软件的绝大多是场景，因此本片文章的重点也是放在了对图形用户界面的分析上。\n\n## 第二章 软件操作的两个情景\n\n### 第一节 计算机辅助绘图\n\n#### **知识经验与日常经验**\n\n手掌以下两个手指的地方，也叫寸口，是长度单位。当我们想要找出正确的垂直线的时候，我们用线吊起一个重物，地心引力给手施加的压力感，以及有关万有引力的知识，让你有信心认为这根线一定是垂直指向地面的。这些“原始”的测量活动中，身体的感知必不可少。然而科学与理性的发展，让我们的脑海中多了一些超越经验范畴的知识。在墨家的《经》与欧几里得的《几何原本》中对“线”的描述有相似的地方。“端，体之无厚而最前者也”（《经》，墨子），“端，是无间”（《经说》），“点是没有的部分”（《几何原本》，欧几里得）。这些几何的概念让我们对事物的尺度具备了一种极限的认知与感悟。随着计算机辅助设计（CAD）等相关的工具软件的诞生，“点”、“线”、“面”这些原本抽象且极限的概念，在电脑中却可以以一种数学与视觉的方式显现。不仅如此，这些辅助工具还预置了让我们的设计更加完美高效的程序。比如贝塞尔曲线、B样条等算法，会根据我们实际绘制的折线，预测并描画出具有极高精度的平滑曲线。从那时开始，那些超出我们身体经验之外的精确与完美的形式，已经内化到我们的直觉中了。\n\n在人使用工具的过程中，基于科学的软件工具的发明，将那些数学几何的认知方式嵌入到了我们的身体意识当中。使得我们观察和绘图的过程中，添加了一个中间层。计算机辅助绘图软件就是这样一种中间层，下面将会以奥多比的绘图软件为例来讨论计算机辅助绘图中的人机交互关系。\n\n#### **奥多比公司的绘图工具**\n\n与计算机绘图软件起始与伊万·萨瑟兰（Ivan Sutherland）的一篇博士论文《画板》（sketchpad）（1963）。 画板（sketchpad）被认为是计算机辅助设计（CAD)的始祖。在还没有鼠标和键盘这些现代电脑标配的交互套件的时代，画板（sketchpad）这套系统就具备了非常流畅的电脑绘图交互。画板（sketchpad）可以通过“光笔”（一种光敏输入设备），可以在屏幕上绘制几何图形。并且对几个图形的各部分属性可以进行任意改动。复制、粘贴、长度修改、对齐、对称、夹角度数等等几何性质都可以精确控制，并且可以在有限的屏幕尺寸内，无线的放大和缩小图形。这项发明在当时是非常突破性的，伊万·萨瑟兰（Ivan Sutherland）博士被认为是人机交互（HCI）学科的开创人，绘图程序sketchpad的图形用户界面和面向对象的编程方法被认为是计算机图形学的重大突破。实际上，Sutherland博士凭借这篇论文成功获得了1988年的图灵奖。也正是这一年，奥多比（Adobe）公司的Illustrator桌面绘图软件正是发布了。\n\n图 1 Sketchpad， 1963\n\n《画板》（sketchpad）作为第一个图形用户界面和第一个交互式绘图程序，影响了后面的许多重要软件，奥多比的Illustrator（Adobe Illustrator）就是其中发展最好的软件之一。奥多比（Adobe）公司创始人约翰·沃诺克（John Warnock）在Evans and Sutherland公司工作的时候（Ivan Sutherland和Evans创办的著名的计算机图形公司）开始了PostScript编程语言的想法。这个技术后来成为了奥多比（Adobe）公司早期的核心技术。苹果公司的乔布斯看中奥多比（Adobe）公司的技术，并用在了苹果与佳能合作的激光打印机LaserWrite上。自从1988年Adobe Illustrator在麦金塔电脑上发布开始，电脑绘图和数字打印输出就完美的结合起来了。桌面绘图软件Illustrator，苹果麦金塔电脑和鼠标键盘，佳能的激光打印机。这一整套的工作流水线，颠覆了传统绘图和印刷出版的模式，开创了以电脑和打印机为中心的桌面出版的模式。而奥多比（Adobe）系列软件也成为了现代平面设计不可或缺的必备工作套件。从那时开始，设计绘图就从尺规手绘变成了用鼠标在屏幕上调整贝塞尔曲线。这样的模式，一直延续到现在。\n\n在前文中我们已经提到过，几何的知识，让我们具备了超越日常经验之上的认知。而这些从墨子和欧几里得发源的几何的理性知识，经由现代科学的演化，逐渐具体化成为了屏幕中的操作界面。Illustrator工具栏上琳琅满目的工具图标，虽然有着具象化的，甚至是拟物风格的图标，让你产生对生活世界中的铅笔、钢笔等工具的联想认知，但实际上他们千差万别。\n\n在Illustrator中所有的曲线绘制都是基于贝塞尔曲线算法的。当你试图用AI Illustrator）画点儿什么，即使你使用最简单的铅笔功能，Illustrator都会直接用贝塞尔的曲线对这条路径进行重新绘制。然后你可以用“直接选择”工具来调整每一个控制点。这条重绘的曲线损失了一些原作者的精确细节，但它使线条变得更完美、更符合标准的工业流程。它增强了我们对形状和线条的控制力。而复制、平移、翻转、镜像、透视变形、风格笔刷等等，更加增强了这一属性。正如Illustrator 1.0上市使用的品牌形象《维纳斯的诞生》（波提切利）一样，“让你创造完美的曲线”是Illustrator的立足之本。\n\n绘画是们古老的艺术，心、手和眼的密切配合中有着很多不可分割的相互作用过程，这决定了电脑辅助绘图将是一个高度具身化的技术。在与计算机绘图软件的发展中，数位绘画板应运而生。值得一提的是。数位板的发明实际上远早于绘图程序、乃至计算机的发明。早在1888年，伊莱莎·格雷（Elisha Gray）就发明了电传笔（如图表6），可以被认为是在电报时代用来签名的机器。现代的数位笔，如和冠(Wacom)数位笔，与其技术形式是十分相似的，他们都是将人工轨迹转换成电信号传输到电子系统来。只不过现代数位笔的无线无源技术，采用一种更自然，巧妙的技术形式。如和冠(Wacom)的数位笔使用电磁场来进行电子笔的状态探测，无需供电，就可以将笔的倾斜、压感等信息传递给电脑。使电子绘图的体验进一步逼近真实的纸笔绘图。\n\n数位板、数位笔与奥多比系列软件整合起来的数位出版工作方式，提高了出版物生产的效率，同时也促成了出版图画的新的时尚。用Illustrator绘制的图形既漂亮美观，又能高效产出，迅速风靡。电脑绘图的“自然化”实际上是唐·伊德意义上技术的具身化的加强，技术更好的化身为了人类的能力的一部分，变得更加透明化。这也使得人在使用工具的时候更不觉得工具的存在，与此同时，人的技术带来的感知能力也更加内化为人的感知。使用者可以画出更完美的曲线，更精准的造型，更完美的重复与按比例变化的细节。\n\n技术的透明度一方面让技术本身“抽身而去”，使用者在绘制的过程中忘记了工具的存在，另一方面让我们相信并依靠自己被增强的技能。绘图软件中种类繁多的微自动功能，给绘图者形象思维中植入了数学的模型。这些来自工具的逻辑不断内化到使用者的行为和想象中。\n\n谷歌人工智能实验室的日本员工在其网站上发布一个书写汉字的小实验Kanji-rnn。该实验使用了具有短期记忆的神经网络模型，通过大量将汉字的路径喂给模型，他就可以形成一个对汉字结构的模糊概念。在这个项目的线上互动展示项目上，你可以通过鼠标输入汉字的部分笔画，Kanji-rnn会实时地预测接下来的笔画，完成汉字书写。虽然这个项目并没有什么特别的研究目标，仅仅是为了实验模型的可能性。该模型只是借用表面的字形模式，并没有真正理解汉字的字形组成的内涵意义。但是类似通过路径预测的方式，如果放在警方判断犯罪行为上，则可以形成强有力的决策行为。实际上这样的方法已经发生在了现实之中。而这些更具自主性的数学模型与AI中为自动化的路径预测有着同源的亲近关系。\n\n在Illustrator的使用情景中，使用者不仅仅是通过软件来完成自己的工作，同时也在软件提供的功能框架下，逐渐形成了与软件相互镶嵌的技巧与艺术语言。软件并不是中立的，软件实际参与了绘图方法甚至设计方式的建立。在这一直觉关系中，软件不仅具有具身性，同时也有它异性。具身性增强了控制几何元素的能力，同时也将使用者的心与手的可能性简化到了数学模型的范围。而繁多且不断完善的微自动功能，也让软件具有了某种能动性， 亦即主体性。\n\nIllustrator软件是计算机辅助绘图中的一种，作为奥多比（Adobe）公司的头号产品之一，如今非常密切的参与着平面类型的创意图形的输出，包括平面设计、插画、二维动画等。作为艺术创意领域的辅助设计软件，相比如工业领域的诸如AutoCAD、犀牛等软件来说，Illustrator的软件逻辑和操作使用相对来说更加人性化，或者说有更好的“用户体验”。在界面设计领域，当说一个软件有比较好的用户体验的时候，一般是认为这个软件使用起来有比较低的学习门槛和比较直觉化的操作逻辑。“较低的学习门槛”可以被认为是软件的各部分功能和使用逻辑与用户在现实世界的经验有更多的重合。“更符合直觉的使用逻辑”是指软件的使用方法能够最大效率地是通过界面的暗示传达给用户。就使用者的感受来说，会让人感觉软件更好“上手”，觉得很好用。\n\n软件技术不仅仅是中立的工具和手段。在人与软件的交互过程中，技术依循自身的逻辑，或改造、或扩充我们的知觉，同时也选择性的简化某些认知能力。软件的自身逻辑，是其发展中的它异化的体现，逐渐发展为具有主体性的关系。在推动技术发展的过程中，我们应该密切关注技术给我们带来的影响，从而更好的让技术和我们成为合作者的而关系，而不是反噬或对立。\n\n### 第二节 抖音App的体验闭环\n\n互动体验设计是网联网产品设计的一个专业领域，其核心目标是如何使软件产品更好用。但这样的目标在一些免费的产品中，却显得有悖其初衷。从利益或者说从根本上的商业逻辑上来考虑，用户和流量就是金钱。所以免费软件的经营者和产品经理们不得不绞尽脑汁的来拉拢近的用户并促进用户活跃度，行话称其为“拉新”和“促活”。在这样的大背景下，被称为用户的软件使用者们，行为上瘾在所难免。免费的软件实际上并不免费。\n\n免费经济带来的软件沉迷是值得反思和探讨的，在这一章中我讲探讨抖音app为例，来探讨社交类软件是如何构建起不断吸引用户使用的体验闭环的。\n\n#### **那些欲罢不能的功能**\n\n在社交类的软件的互动设计中，有许多让人“上瘾”的功能，比如facebook发明的点赞，youtube的自动播放下一条视频，app来新消息时的小红点，粉丝量，等等。者每一项发明的背后几乎有着心理学的原理，利用人们的心理弱点，来让用户不假思索地产生行动。著名学者普林斯顿心理学博士亚当 · 阿尔特（Adam Alter）曾提出了“行为上瘾”的概念，并列举了行为上瘾的六项相关构成要素，分别是：\n\n1. 诱人的目标\n2. 无法抵挡且无法预知的积极反馈\n3. 渐进改善的感觉\n4. 越来越困难的任务\n5. 需要解决却暂未解决的紧张感\n6. 强大的社会联系\n   抖音则全部满足了以上要求。如自动推荐的内容，让用户始终无法预知下一个视频的内容，始终保持好奇、滑动屏幕的时候自动播放、15秒配有动感音乐的短视频与自动播放、和点赞社交的激励。其中功能大多都有相应的神经学或者脑科学的理论的成果支持。如间歇性变量奖励（自动推荐）、先于理智的音乐与视觉刺激（自动播放）、蔡格尼克记忆效应（Zeigarnik effect）（15秒视频的意犹未尽）等等。基于抖音软件的音乐短视频的内容和其产品理念“记录美好生活”，抖音在基于以上设计之中主要强化的了沉浸式瀑布流的交互形式，接下来我将主要分析抖音主界面的瀑布流交互。", "timestamp": 1658562926, "digest": "XcChq2AFKErcKSkJCfUL9-_tZUWtjGdWUfwGPOqoqP4",

{"id": "Bap_BXoeK7_HqorDbDk6y6qkHVNxrXMznl2z5KGoj5M", "title": "CIAN - Defi 自動化平台", "body": "## 項目簡介\n\nCIAN 是一個一站式的 Defi 自動化操作平台，串連了多個 Defi 協議並定義出許多不同的模組化任務，讓你可以自由地組合出需要的投資策略。CIAN 幫忙減少了許多鏈上繁瑣的操作，節省人力與時間成本的同時，還可以提升你的資本利用率與投資效率。使用此平台你不需要像使用其他收益聚合器一樣，將資產放在 Defi 協議金庫中已進行投資策略，反之你的資產都會放在一個由你擁有的智能合約錢包中，不用將資產託管給任何人，只需要進行有限的授權即可使用投資策略。\n\n只看上面描述可能稍難想像 CIAN 實質上可以做什麼，以下舉個例：\n\n> 當我們在鏈上流動性挖礦尤其是開槓桿在挖時，最害怕的就是幣價劇烈漲跌導致清算，沒賺到利息還賠了本金。而 CIAN 可以做到 當 Collateral Ratio 過度上升時自動幫你減倉避免清算，同時還能做到當 Collateral Ratio 下降時自動幫你加倉讓你資金利用率更高APY更高。（ p.s. 在 CIAN 平台中 Collateral Ratio 的定義是：債務價值/抵押品價值 x 100%，越高越容易被清算。）\n\n項目方目前正在舉行[測試活動](https://cian-app.medium.com/automated-protection-week-bc9e3eea7bb8)，完成任務可獲得 NFT ，日後會依據 NFT 進行代幣空投。個人非常建議大家去做測試任務，可以對平台使用的邏輯有更全面的了解（還可以嚕點空投）。\n\n（風險提示：此產品還在初期階段，目前合約陸續審計中\\[[審計報告](https://docs.cian.app/security-and-risk/audit-report)\\]，使用時請注意風險控管。此文內容與心得皆來自於官方資料及小弟跟官方人員的問答，皆為個人見解莫忘DYOR）\n\n## CIAN 官方資料\n\n網站：<https://cian.app/>\n推特：<https://twitter.com/CIAN_protocol>\nDC：[discord.gg/cian](https://t.co/1MgtsDZEta)\nYoutube：<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNXPpWUHKL0SJG9npO_QCug>\nDocs：<https://docs.cian.app/>\nMedium：[cian-app.medium.com](https://t.co/Sm6acl91zS)\n\n## 功能簡介\n\nCIAN 使用非託管的智能合約錢包來實現自動化幫使用者執行 Defi 策略任務的功能。除了一站式好管理以外，還有精簡操作步驟、自動化加倉、自動化保護倉位、一鍵閃電貸倉位上槓桿等功能，可以說是 Defi Degen 的利器。CIAN 是有多鏈野心的，不過目前初期公鏈先只支援Avalanche，Protocol 方面目前支援 借貸協議包括：AAVE、Benqi、Trader Joe，流動性協議包括：Axial、Curve、Pangolin、Trader Joe、Vector。相信日後會越支援更多協議提供更多組合性。\n\n接下來會一一簡介功能的用途，使用方式及步驟 官方Youtube 有非常詳細的 Step by Step 教學我會附上。\n\n### Smart Contract Wallet - 智能合約錢包\n\n在我們開始使用 CIAN 的服務前我們會需要先創建一個智能合約錢包，這是因為 CIAN 主打自動化，這意味著我們只需設定好任務，之後人可以離開、去睡覺、去玩 不用一直提心吊膽的看著，我們的鏈上投資會照著設定的規則自動運行。在無託管、確保資產安全性的前提下，CIAN要做到這件事的解法就是替我們創建一個由使用者自己擁有的智能合約，再由使用者透過 [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) 授權 CIAN 替我們的倉位進行各種設定好的操作，CIAN 取得授權後只能操作你存入智能合約錢包中的資產與瓦斯費，不會能控制你本身錢包內的任何資產，這點是很不錯的設計。\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/9Gg74nn1WsI](https://youtu.be/9Gg74nn1WsI)\n\n### Position Building - 倉位創建\n\n* **Borrow to Farm**\n\n這是我們經常會使用到的 Farming 策略，CIAN 將其整合起來讓你可以一頁式操作多個需要用到的協議。\n\n此功能讓你可以簡單快速做到以下步驟： 存資產到借貸平台 -> 借出其他資產 -> 將資產換成 50/50 的兩種資產 -> 組成 LP -> Farming LP。\n\n經統計以上步驟若無 CIAN 幫你整合，你至少得跳轉頁面 7 次經過 3 個不同的 Protocol 點擊 46 下才能完成，而在 CIAN 你可以在 1 個頁面裡 10 次點擊內完成，雖然我不是數學家但這聽起來很不錯對吧！\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/Q68-uDr_1OI](https://youtu.be/Q68-uDr_1OI)\n\n### Automation Scenarios - 自動化場景\n\n當設定的條件滿足了，會自動執行相應任務。\n\n* **Auto Borrow 自動借款**\n\n在借貸協議中當你的抵押品(ex:ETH)價格上漲時，可以借出來使用的資產也會變多，但若要時常關注並手動調整光用想的就覺得很麻煩，Auto Borrow 解決的就是這件事。我們可以提前設定，當抵押品上漲 Collateral Ratio 降到一定比率時，自動幫忙借款加倉我們的倉位，將 Collateral Ratio 調整到設定的比率，提高資產利用率。\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/eES9RfIC0ZE](https://youtu.be/eES9RfIC0ZE)\n\n* **Auto Repay 自動還款**\n\n相對於 Auto Borrow，當抵押品價格下跌，會造成我們的 collateral ratio 升高，增加清算風險。所以有這個功能，讓我們可以提前設定，當抵押品下跌 Collateral Ratio 升到一定比率，自動幫忙降低倉位並向借貸協議還款，將 Collateral Ratio 調整到設定的比率，降低清算風險。\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/og7b9aEMLcU](https://youtu.be/og7b9aEMLcU)\n\n* **Flash Repay 閃電還款**\n\n在市場經歷極端行情時，可能會造成 Auto Repay 無法即時調倉成功，需要非常手段來進行 Reapy 避免清算，這就是 Flash Reapy 的功能。Flash Repay 作用的原理是 直接使用 AAVE 的 [Flash Loan 閃電貸](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/flash-loans) 功能在無需抵押品的情況下借錢去 Repay 你的債務 降低 Collateral Ratio 避免清算，解除危機後再變賣你的抵押品來還閃電貸的錢，全部在一個區塊裡完成。是非常直接快速的 Repay 方式，需要注意的是使用閃電貸會產生 0.09% 的手續費，不過總比被清算好，這還是一個很有效的極端行情保險措施！\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/pmOxKXnzIPg](https://youtu.be/pmOxKXnzIPg)\n\n### Automated Strategies - 自動化策略\n\nCIAN 提供了一些很不錯的自動化策略供我們使用，若你有不錯的策略想提供給 CIAN做使用，也可以加入官方DC群到 [#strategy-lab](https://discord.com/channels/948448386963623986/994994081925181560) 提供！下面我來介紹其中一個策略“槓桿質押”賺年化。\n\n* **Leveraged Stacking - AAVE**\n\n這個策略賺了 2 種年化，其一是在 BENQI 質押 Avax 獲得的質押年化，其二是將質押 Avax 拿到的 sAvax 提供到 AAVE 獲得的借貸年化。此策略還會使用閃電貸將我們的資產加上 7 倍槓桿已獲得數倍的年化（撰文當下約60\\~70%年化）。\n\n策略步驟解釋如下（以下所有步驟在1個transaction內完成）：\n\n假設我們有 100 Avax 且 Avax/sAvax 兌換率約為1。\n假設 Max LTV(可以想像成 可以借的價值/需要抵押的價值) = 0.95\\*0.97\\*清算門檻 = 87.54%\n\n1. 質押 100 Avax 到 BENQI(BLS) 並收到 100 sAvax 與質押收益。\n2. 將100 sAvax 存進 AAVE V3 已獲得借貸收益。（E-mode 打開）\n3. 從 Trader Joe 閃電貸貸出 702.56 Avax（加上7.02 倍槓桿）\n4. 將閃電貸到的 702.56 Avax 質押到 BLS 已獲得 702.56 sAvax與額外的質押收益。\n5. 將從上一步拿到的 702.56 Avax 存進 AAVE V3 賺額外的借貸收益。\n6. 使用存入的 802.56 sAvax 當抵押品借出 703.2 Avax 還清閃電貸\n\n此策略的年化計算公式為：\n\n![年化計算公式](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*EWX43_O5isG-snMtwyl2pg.png)\n\n詳細解釋請見 [官方教學文件](https://cian-app.medium.com/leveraged-staking-strategies-for-savax-32662f044298)。非常建議大家使用較為 Degen 的策略前一定要去看看官方解釋文檔，有很多參數像是借貸利率、質押利率、手續費變動都是影響收益的因子，請至少一定要有所了解再行投資。\n\n### 結尾\n\n至此已經將目前 CIAN 有的功能與大家介紹了一遍。我個人認為 CIAN 在做的這件事是有相當需求的，讓人們在不需親自 Coding 的前提下更方便的執行 Defi 策略（畢竟不是任何人都是科學家），除了讓 Defi 樂高的組合更方便，也大大提升投資時的倉位安全與資本效率，總的來說是很不錯的服務方向。項目方目前是打算發幣的也已有測試活動進行中讓大家有機會獲得空投，不過目前代幣捕獲價值的方式還不明確 Tokenomics 還沒公佈，大家若要投資項目代幣還是得先確認營利方式及代幣經濟模型是否足夠健全。\n\n感謝各位觀看，若有任何問題或是想要交流歡迎使用推特與我聯繫。\n\n[https://twitter.com/royhuan38041974](https://twitter.com/royhuan38041974)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658563264, "digest": "F8CAnIM7Gx1QpqJFR9Jaw1Z0NrOf3q_B78yNu1K9W0Y", "contributor": "0xa49aBc88a521dc131a3B859dd40d2B7028Bc78F2"}

{"id": "icGb9wFY1otC27AzVOSD_seoWKrKYztKAnVzcaMAlFc", "title": "7 O’Clock Capital：一文尽览DAO的昨天，今天，明天", "body": "## 引言\n\n根据DeepDAO的数据显示，目前Web3空间已经有4834个DAO组织，管理资产总额超过80亿美金。\n\nDAO最初曾叫做DAC（Decentralized Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n###  一、DAO的定义与优势 \n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表 \n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题 \n\n### 四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658563922, "digest": "KvNt31YsNglF7d1tgkwc11UD6_WpqcxxgBdYYIG-LXc", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

{"id": "mWvGDbam-JzSD1fFtNLP7nS11Vy0PsfwPI1vUWGjOOw", "title": "Freemint全流程工具大全，带你在免费NFT项目里每天赚0.1E\n", "body": "如果说NFT世界里现在最热的机会是什么，几乎所有活跃的NFT玩家都会告诉你，是Freemint NFT项目。几乎所有的Alpha 社区都在讨论各种Freemint项目，并从中找到获利的机会。\n\n所谓Freemint项目就是Mint时项目方不再收取任何费用，你仅需花Gas费，在现在以太日常Gas费极低的状态时，约等于不要钱参与各个NFT项目。\n\n其中有些Freemint NFT 项目是可以参与的，轻松获得几十倍回报（因为gas费可能只花了1-2U，如果能在OpenSea上卖出0.01X ETH的价格，那就是几十倍的利润回报）。\n\n本文将对如下问题，结合最趁手的工具工具，一步步来教你如何参与Freemint项目，并有机会每个钱包每天获取0.1E以上的合理利润：\n\n1、Freemint的项目如何第一时间知道；\n\n2、如何避免有坑的Freemint项目（项目方在授权中有各种后门，或者是批量制造Freemint项目，没有买盘白花了Gas费）；\n\n3、如何第一时间上架并设置最合理的卖价让利润奔跑；\n\n4、如何在二级市场里买到性价比最高的Freemint项目转手再卖获得二次利润\n\n### 一、如何使用Freemint工具安全快速的参加Freemint NFT项目\n\n这个市场上如何第一时间得知Freemint项目呢？因为Freemint项目知道稍晚，就参与不了了，一般用户是通过moby或者icy.tools两个平台来发现Freemint项目，但是这两个公众皆知的平台往往会滞后5-30分钟的时间。\n\n在这里我推荐更快速的方法能帮助你抢的头筹。\n\n在上一篇文章：NFT赋能方式评价指南里，提到了一个PASS卡的项目Metabus。\n\n在Opensea找到Metabus项目，买到他们的Pass卡，然后到官网：metabus.tech里质押12个月，然后到Metabus 的discord 里验证一下自己的钱包，然后在Support里open ticket，提出申请，就能进入First Class群组。\n\n当你获得了First Class角色后，就可以开通如下功能：\n\n其中Free-mint功能就能获得当前市场最新的Freemint项目的必须资讯，可以比moby和icy.tools快5-30分钟，这样你就有充分的时间可以分析这个项目的网站、Twiiter和Discord的用户数和交互活跃度。\n\n因为如果一个Freemint项目没有网站，没有Twitter（Opensea上没有项目方的网站和twitter链接），那么基本就可以认为是一个临时拼凑的资金盘项目了，甚至可能有坑。\n\n如果项目方网站制作精美，Twitter用户数和交互活跃，那可以考虑参与，而且日后可能会有很大的上升空间。\n\n这里举一个百倍的Freemint项目的例子，早看到查询项目方Twitter后，可以判断这是一个绝对可以抢的Freemint的项目。\n\n至于如何能卖到这么高的价格，就要看下面的文章了。\n\n上面我们得知了Freemint项目，但是只有交易hash，并不知道mint的地址，下面这个工具则是帮你快速mint的工具，而不需要找到网站。\n\n冲土狗：也是Metabus开发的，安全性无需怀疑\n\n[冲土狗](https://tools.metabus.tech/#)\n\n[冲土狗](https://tools.metabus.tech/#)\n\n[tools.metabus.tech](https://tools.metabus.tech/#)\n\n第一步：打开网页，点击：确认PRC节点\n\n第二步：从刚才的metabus的discord 的Free-mint频道里看中的Freemint项目，点击监听交易，找到交易的Hash，填入到上图中：复制别人的交易Hash；\n\n第三步：工具自动帮你算出小费、MaxFee、Gas limit、总价、合约地址、十六进制数据，如果是Freemint项目，这些数据可以不用更改。\n\n第四步：在小狐狸钱包插件里找到专门冲土狗的钱包的私钥（冲Freemint项目一定要用新的钱包，里面最多放0.3E，用于Gas和在Opensea上架，定期将盈利转出），填入选择本地私钥的对话框，然后点击验证，然后执行Mint\n\n第五步：点击页面左上角：重置页面数据。\n\n上述步骤就完成参与一个Freemint项目的过程，但是仅仅会买是不够的，如何快速且用当前最合适的价格卖出成本，并且判断是否有持续上涨的机会争取最大获益才是关键，下面的文档就是教你如何组合使用工具帮你利润奔跑。\n\n### 二、如何快速查询Freemint项目中你的NFT稀有度排名？\n\n### ERCSniper\n\n下载安装包，到项目方Discord里找到频道#updates下载最新版至本地，解压后得到dist目录\n\n[Join the ERC Rarity Discord Server!](https://discord.com/invite/ercsniper)\n\n[High-end, advanced NFT data and automation tools | 50,870 members](https://discord.com/invite/ercsniper)\n\n[discord.com](https://discord.com/invite/ercsniper)\n\n进入谷歌浏览器打开扩展程序，浏览器输入：chrome://extensions/，打开开发者模式，点击：加载已解压的扩展程序，选择刚刚erc的解压包，并确认后可成功安装（Windows和Mac都可以安装）\n\n点击ERCSnifer右侧的📌logo，激活ERCSnifer扩展\n\n点击安装成功后的插件显示填写小狐狸id，如下图：\n\n从小狐狸的扩展里找到Metamask ID，然后复制粘贴到这里：\n\n打开Opensea任意一个在售的NFT项目页面之后，点Login，成功后就可以看到弹出的插件显示Connected\n\n同时OS页面也能显示Quick Buy和View on ERCRarity两个新功能模块\n\n在这里输入Gas，输入买入合约的地址，就能用Quick Buy一键买入无需任何确认的过程。\n\n点击View on ERCRarity，可以看到这个项目所有的排名以及上架情况，就可以轻松选择性价比最高的买入。\n\nERCSnifer相比其他查询属性排名的工具，优势在于对新的图狗项目的排名计算特别快，适合冲图狗追求时间和效率的用户使用。\n\n### NFTeye\n\n如果觉得上一个插件安装比较麻烦，也可以使用这个插件\n\n[NFTEye](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nfteye/imbkphhpfhkebpifdomcihkcjelnpamo/related?hl=zh-CN)\n\n[Boost your OpenSea experience with rarity ranks and analytics insights.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nfteye/imbkphhpfhkebpifdomcihkcjelnpamo/related?hl=zh-CN)\n\n[chrome.google.com](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nfteye/imbkphhpfhkebpifdomcihkcjelnpamo/related?hl=zh-CN)\n\n同时配合网站使用，下面我会着重说明一些网站数据如何使用。\n\n[Dashboard Collections/NFTs | NFTEye](https://nfteye.io/dashboard)\n\n[30 Day Volume](https://nfteye.io/dashboard)\n\n[nfteye.io](https://nfteye.io/dashboard)\n\n**数据看板Dashboard**\n\n1、当前（15分钟）热门mint项目和热门交易项目（Hot Mints and Hot Sale Collections）\n\n在这里看到的热门且Mint Price为Free的项目，在Gas不高的情况下，可以利用前文提到的冲土狗工具适当冲几个。或者点击Link，直达项目的页面去手工mint，不过一般好的Freemint的项目，很难抢过使用工具的用户。\n\n2、24小时内前50名交易热度的项目（Top 50 Collections(24H）\n\n**发现Discovery**\n\n可以看到当前交易热度高的项目的发行时间，发行价格等数据\n\n**项目 Collection**\n\n这个功能是重点来查询大家挂单价格的分布情况，同时右上角有个值得大家关注的数据：\n\nOn Sale\n\n这里显示了上架数量/总数量的比例关系，大于10%的项目要尽快出逃，说明这个项目大家觉得尽快卖出有利可图。\n\n如果小于5%，且24小时内交易比较活跃，则可以根据ERSSniper查询排名较高且定价较低的项目买入。\n\n然后结合下图中Listing Ratio，看上架比例的变化趋势，如果是上架比例一直在升高，也要提高警惕，如果Listing Ratio一直在降低，同时Floor Price能保持或有提升，说明这个项目纸手逐渐被吸走，如果有合适的价格可以考虑入手。\n\n另外可以参考的数据就是看项目里大佬的持有数量\n\n两种情况可以作为低价买入的标准：\n\n1、大佬在低价时持续扫货，那就在大佬扫货的更低价时寻找合适标的入手；\n\n2、用户人数/项目 NFT总数如果大于50%（NFT已经均匀分散到各个用户手中）且Listing Ratio一直比较低，说明大家都非常看好这个项目不愿意出售，那么出现低价时也知道入手。\n\n**My Portfolio 我的项目**\n\n这个功能强烈推荐，可以看到这个钱包总花费成本和当前各个项目地板价格可以获得的收益，帮助你更好掌握自己的收益情况！\n\nNFTeye插件里超实用二级市场抄底功能（其他插件目前还没有）：\n\n上面有两组数字：597/5000，这是指这个NFT在总共5000个NFT经过计算属性排名第597，这个功能大家都有，但是第二组数字就要特别关注了：35/541，这是指在当前上架的541个NFT里，它的性价比指数排名第35，属于值得去抢的。\n\n最后一个功能特色，需要加入他们的Discord\n\n[Discord - A New Way to Chat with Friends & Communities](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n[Discord is the easiest way to communicate over voice, video, and text. Chat, hang out, and stay close with your friends and communities.](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n[discord.gg](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n可以查询到：巨鲸扫货，这样自己Freemint的项目如果被扫货，那么后面上架的价格就可以提高\n\n此外NFTeye对于Metabus的Pass 卡会员还提供了特别支持：\n\n只需关注官方推特[@nfteye_io](https://twitter.com/nfteye_io)，转推置顶推特并安装插件，便可在discord内获得OG身份。\n\n有了OG身份，Discord的各项功能都可以使用啦！\n\n### 三、如何计算合理的上架价格？\n\n### NFT Profit Calculator\n\n适合计算Freemint项目的上架价格和收益的工具\n\n[Opensea NFT Profit Calculator | Free, Easy to Use](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n[Calculate the anticipated profit of your NFT Purchase, including break-even price.](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n[opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n点击上面的链接，进入NFT Profit Calculator，NFT上架利润计算器\n\n其中将你将上文中提到的ERCSniper找到的排名最低的免费NFT上架到Opensea，上架价格设定到当前的地板价。\n\nOpensea collection URL or Name：\n\n这里填入刚刚你上架的NFT的Opensea URL（网址），然后点击Get Data。\n\n第三行Royalties（Opensea+Creator）就会自动显示，这里是Opensea的销售抽成+创作者的版税抽成。\n\nBuy Price填入你mint时给项目方的费用，Freemint的项目一般这里是0，其他的项目根据你参与的价格填写。\n\nGas Fee根据你mint时大概的成本填入\n\nListing Fee是你第一次在Opensea上卖这个项目需要Opensea批准所花的gas费，仅本系列第一个NFT项目售卖时才会有的成本。\n\nListing Price就是你上架的价格。\n\n上述输入完毕后，关注下面的数据\n\nBREAKEVEN 是指你的盈亏平衡价，高于这个价格都会是赚钱的\n\nTRUE PROFIT 是你本笔交易会盈利的价格。\n\n⚠️：严格管制ERCSniper 给的Rank，如果本系列Freemint NFT的交易量很大（每分钟交易数量超过5笔，或者在NFTeye Dashboard的Hot collections的排名里）排在前5%、10%，前30%的一定要给一个比地板价更高的价格，别轻易就贱卖了。\n\n### Derisk收益计算器\n\n这个计算器适合用在Mint非免费的项目上计算收益\n\n[Derisk](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n[Enter a transaction hash/id above to view the transaction details and derisk amount.](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n[www.derisk.tools](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n来自Metabus的骄子的分享\n\n这个计算收益的工具会更简便， 输入mint或者交易时的hash，填入你想卖的价格，自动计算收益了。\n\n这个计算工具推荐使用在正常的NFT项目上，对于Freemint项目，因为缺乏Mint和List的Gas成本统计，所以还有偏差。因为Freemint项目里Gas成本占比很高。\n\n### 四、上架和批量购买的工具Gem.xyz\n\n最近当出现一些比较火热的Freemint项目时，Opensea的相关页面经常出现拥堵。比如Netfilx的NFT项目，就出现页面30分钟没有打开，到时Floor Price从1一直降到了0.04ETH。如果能及时上架，可能就获得了最好的销售价格。\n\n这里推荐一个批量上架和批量购买的工具：Gem\n\n[Gem - The NFT Marketplace Aggregator](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[Discover and collect NFTs across all marketplaces](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[www.gem.xyz](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n当Mint完NFT希望能快速批量上架时，选中你要上架的NFT，然后点击右侧：Proceed to LIst。\n\n进入到下一个页面后，可以在NFT Marketplaces上选择要上架的平台：Opensea、Looksrare和X2Y2可以一键上架。\n\n同一个NFT在Opensea设置好价格，这个NFT在Looksrare和X2Y2的价格也设置好了，不同的NFT可以阶梯设置价格。\n\n都设置好后，点击右侧：Set Your Price。可以一键帮你在各个平台完成这个项目NFT授权并签名上架。使得你上架的速度远超过其他人，可以在最好的价格时卖出，同时还节约了Gas费。\n\n另外一个值得使用的功能就是批量购买（主要是扫地板）。\n\n当我们在NFTeye里看到有价值的NFT项目，这里拿Free mint的项目：Mender NFT举例，这个项目是免费mint的，但是只要价格低于0.012ETH（相对于免费mint用户的4倍收益），就会有批量扫地板的用户。\n\n所以我也通过Gem，选择Mender NFT，然后在地板价里选择我要购买的NFT，然后点击：Buy Now\n\n使用批量购买工具的好处，一是比别人更快抢到低价，二是Gas比分开在Opensea上买要节省。\n\n所以如果大家喜欢做Freemint项目二级市场的高抛低吸，Gem是一件必不可少的工具。\n\n如果你希望持续看到原创的高质量文章，请关注Twitter：[@TheOneGuo](https://twitter.com/TheOneGuo)\n\n关注我的Mirror：下载Inoreader APP，输入：<https://submirror.xyz/autometafi.eth/> 可以完成对我的Mirror的订阅，当新的原创文章写完后，可以随时在APP上获得提醒并阅读\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658563867, "digest": "Q_aZ37Ada0_ZfOa7GhMIK3uG3XMd9H96mpM3D4YUuZQ", "contributor": "0x25b8584F65E4ee2FDa74c90E4a3A1755efA92580"}

Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n###  一、DAO的定义与优势 二、DAO的分类与代表 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题 四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658563875, "digest": "KZjXp2uEShfYRLc4TpJgz_bZ4uZkKpUrbEMJgHitSew", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

Chat, hang out, and stay close with your friends and communities.](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n[discord.gg](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n可以查询到：巨鲸扫货，这样自己Freemint的项目如果被扫货，那么后面上架的价格就可以提高\n\n此外NFTeye对于Metabus的Pass 卡会员还提供了特别支持：\n\n只需关注官方推特[@nfteye_io](https://twitter.com/nfteye_io)，转推置顶推特并安装插件，便可在discord内获得OG身份。\n\n有了OG身份，Discord的各项功能都可以使用啦！\n\n### 三、如何计算合理的上架价格？\n\n### NFT Profit Calculator\n\n适合计算Freemint项目的上架价格和收益的工具\n\n[Opensea NFT Profit Calculator | Free, Easy to Use](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n[Calculate the anticipated profit of your NFT Purchase, including break-even price.](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n[opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n点击上面的链接，进入NFT Profit Calculator，NFT上架利润计算器\n\n其中将你将上文中提到的ERCSniper找到的排名最低的免费NFT上架到Opensea，上架价格设定到当前的地板价。\n\nOpensea collection URL or Name：\n\n这里填入刚刚你上架的NFT的Opensea URL（网址），然后点击Get Data。\n\n第三行Royalties（Opensea+Creator）就会自动显示，这里是Opensea的销售抽成+创作者的版税抽成。\n\nBuy Price填入你mint时给项目方的费用，Freemint的项目一般这里是0，其他的项目根据你参与的价格填写。\n\nGas Fee根据你mint时大概的成本填入\n\nListing Fee是你第一次在Opensea上卖这个项目需要Opensea批准所花的gas费，仅本系列第一个NFT项目售卖时才会有的成本。\n\nListing Price就是你上架的价格。\n\n上述输入完毕后，关注下面的数据\n\nBREAKEVEN 是指你的盈亏平衡价，高于这个价格都会是赚钱的\n\nTRUE PROFIT 是你本笔交易会盈利的价格。\n\n⚠️：严格管制ERCSniper 给的Rank，如果本系列Freemint NFT的交易量很大（每分钟交易数量超过5笔，或者在NFTeye Dashboard的Hot collections的排名里）排在前5%、10%，前30%的一定要给一个比地板价更高的价格，别轻易就贱卖了。\n\n### Derisk收益计算器\n\n这个计算器适合用在Mint非免费的项目上计算收益\n\n[Derisk](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n[Enter a transaction hash/id above to view the transaction details and derisk amount.](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n[www.derisk.tools](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n来自Metabus的骄子的分享\n\n这个计算收益的工具会更简便， 输入mint或者交易时的hash，填入你想卖的价格，自动计算收益了。\n\n这个计算工具推荐使用在正常的NFT项目上，对于Freemint项目，因为缺乏Mint和List的Gas成本统计，所以还有偏差。因为Freemint项目里Gas成本占比很高。\n\n### 四、上架和批量购买的工具Gem.xyz\n\n最近当出现一些比较火热的Freemint项目时，Opensea的相关页面经常出现拥堵。比如Netfilx的NFT项目，就出现页面30分钟没有打开，到时Floor Price从1一直降到了0.04ETH。如果能及时上架，可能就获得了最好的销售价格。\n\n这里推荐一个批量上架和批量购买的工具：Gem\n\n[Gem - The NFT Marketplace Aggregator](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[Discover and collect NFTs across all marketplaces](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[www.gem.xyz](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n当Mint完NFT希望能快速批量上架时，选中你要上架的NFT，然后点击右侧：Proceed to LIst。\n\n进入到下一个页面后，可以在NFT Marketplaces上选择要上架的平台：Opensea、Looksrare和X2Y2可以一键上架。\n\n同一个NFT在Opensea设置好价格，这个NFT在Looksrare和X2Y2的价格也设置好了，不同的NFT可以阶梯设置价格。\n\n都设置好后，点击右侧：Set Your Price。可以一键帮你在各个平台完成这个项目NFT授权并签名上架。使得你上架的速度远超过其他人，可以在最好的价格时卖出，同时还节约了Gas费。\n\n另外一个值得使用的功能就是批量购买（主要是扫地板）。\n\n当我们在NFTeye里看到有价值的NFT项目，这里拿Free mint的项目：Mender NFT举例，这个项目是免费mint的，但是只要价格低于0.012ETH（相对于免费mint用户的4倍收益），就会有批量扫地板的用户。\n\n所以我也通过Gem，选择Mender NFT，然后在地板价里选择我要购买的NFT，然后点击：Buy Now\n\n使用批量购买工具的好处，一是比别人更快抢到低价，二是Gas比分开在Opensea上买要节省。\n\n所以如果大家喜欢做Freemint项目二级市场的高抛低吸，Gem是一件必不可少的工具。\n\n如果你希望持续看到原创的高质量文章，请关注Twitter：[@TheOneGuo](https://twitter.com/TheOneGuo)\n\n关注我的Mirror：下载Inoreader APP，输入：<https://submirror.xyz/autometafi.eth/> 可以完成对我的Mirror的订阅，当新的原创文章写完后，可以随时在APP上获得提醒并阅读\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658563866, "digest": "JEEWTgiCshgP_oeU6ysS79HfATOdQMGp22m6jNG0q4U", "contributor": "0xC46b27C093D2f8eD4A74f2E8dB62663B597b374b"}
{"id": "FD5Oz1S27WsVIt44ihda-9d2uGh3GTIQ-FlF8fDR12k", "title": "7 O’Clock Capital：一文尽览DAO的昨天，今天，明天", "body": "## 引言\n\n根据DeepDAO的数据显示，目前Web3空间已经有4834个DAO组织，管理资产总额超过80亿美金。\n\nDAO最初曾叫做DAC（Decentralized Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n二、DAO的分类与代表\n三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658564035, "digest": "Dhx8U-zD1csc5EWPhDR-uNNfMQBUnHZ_uexhKRdI98c", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n一、DAO的定义与优势\n二、DAO的分类与代表\n三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658564074, "digest": "AwrvrNGsQ9zo7Yrz2vH-EzAfnYmCNGSlGf0yvl8l9N8", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n\n\n一、DAO的定义与优势\n\n二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658564196, "digest": "TO6ZKcX29WgVAxXLBzzoJNKsgKzPKL-5l1sOw6iiRFM", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

He had got to do this because he was tired of his parents’ nagging (唠叨的) about his English study and did not want to go through it any longer. He couldn’t get along well with English and disliked joining in English classes because he thought his teacher ignored him on purpose. As a result, his score in each exam never added up to over 60.\n\n　　His partner was concerned about him very much. She understood exactly what he was suffering from, but entirely disagreed with his idea. In order to calm him down and settle his problem, she talked with him face to face and swapped (交换) a series of learning tips with him. The items she set down helped him find the highway to studying English well.\n\n　　The teenager was grateful and got great power from his friend’s words.
