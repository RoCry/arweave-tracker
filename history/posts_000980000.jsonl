Qual foi a razão do meu interesse? A necessidade de sentir na pele os preços a subir, o salário estagnado e uma ambição de descobrir a razão e o porquê de ser um afortunado com este presente que é a vida.\n\nSempre gostei de pessoas, de as ouvir mas nunca tive interesse por política ou como o dinheiro funciona, até mesmo o que é o dinheiro, como a razão de o usarmos e o idolatrar todos os dias. No entanto, depois de alguns anos de independência percebi que a falta de interesse de minha parte foi induzida e programada na “folha em branco” desde o nascimento. Na minha opinião, esta folha em branco não está vazia, limpa e pronta para outras pessoas pintarem com as cores e texturas que idealizam. Acredito que quando nascemos a nossa tela já tem cor e desejos, não importa quais são, só sei que não é “branca”. \n\nÉ com este desabafo que tentarei transmitir o que tenho estado a aprender, a informação que tenho consumido sobre as peças do jogo que é a vida.

Adjust Level 2 requirements (long executor)\n  * This proposal is for the Aave community's approval to modify the governance standards (proposition power, quorum vote differential) for Level 2 ideas, which will have an impact on the most important parts of the Aave ecosystem.\n  * From the perspective of the BGD, this is strongly advised because those requirements were established in the past when the AAVE fragmentation was different and because it could result in the creation of an artificial and self-imposed bottleneck to pass proposals that, given their technical nature, shouldn't really face opposition.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe1e42fd73a2d734d78a65e514a6996c785e90bc82a2e896825dd4af003aeec15); \\[BIP-29\\] Introduce GaugeAdder v2\n  * The GaugeAdder is a component of veBAL architecture that securely facilitates the process of adding new gauges to the system. It incorporates checks to make sure that only gauges deployed from authorized gauge makers can be included in the veBAL system and become eligible for BAL emissions. \n  * The GaugeAdder has to be updated to handle this extension as we are ready to add gauges from additional networks. The smart contracts team at Balancer Labs has deployed a coordinator contract to facilitate this upgrading.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xf354daf0ed08373938b30da9e47e8814fd8922881eb6baf6560ae34b78ceeb5b); \\[BIP-31\\] Authorize the Batch Relayer v3\n  * The functionality included in v3 is mainly intended to help with the upcoming migration of stabal3 and bb-a-USD to the soon-to-be-deployed new version of bb-a-USD. The previously known vulnerabilities are addressed in this updated bb-a-USD, which also adds new functionality like recovery mode and the capacity to charge the Aave yield the Balancer's protocol cost.\n  * The new Batch Relayer will also be able to stake and unstake on the user's behalf in the gauges. This will make it possible to complete the aforementioned migration in a single transaction (after the user has approved the Batch Relayer). Additionally, it can make claims for user rewards from gauges, creating the prospect of claim-invest-stake flows for a single transaction.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x29a37ab71ce03a5e167fd012c363e72088bd0554d2b25c99f3373fa7cceb7124); \\[BIP-32\\] Funding Proposal for Daoism Systems: PROTOCOL REVENUE SHARING FOR POOL & FACTORY CREATORS\n  * In Berlin, Daoism Systems was established in January 2022 by computer scientists, engineers, and researchers to develop on-chain solutions for web3 enterprises. \n  * The team is taking the initiative with this proposal to forge closer ties between Daoism Systems and Balancer and to contribute our skills to the expansion of Balancer's ecosystem.\n  * The author sincerely feels that implementing the revenue-sharing protocol for pool and factory designers will enhance Balancer's governance efficacy and make it more appealing for developers to build new products on top of Balancer.\n* [Balancer Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x797467e0b451a49773cfea97359a32ab880caee688d16fe7db41f94a4e0570f0); \\[BIP-33\\] Orb Marketing Budget Proposal for the Remainder of Q3\n  * This proposal aims to continue Balancer marketing within the newly funded Orb Collective Service Provider (SP), under the new Operating Framework. \n  * The Orb marketing team wants to hasten Balancer Protocol's development and public exposure. The marketing demands of Balancer are ever-evolving. Each advertising campaign, product launch, or announcement is unique and designed for the occasion. Instead of semi-annually or annually, the team will ask for a budget every three months to make the biggest impact and show off Balancer's full potential. Balancer has reduced numerous expenses in order to be as lean as possible and whether the current market while it is in the middle of a bear cycle.\n  * For the remainder of Q3, a budget of $ 76,770.00 has been requested.

How could we use additional DeFi legos to bring them to the next level?\n\n## Dopex’s Interest Rate Options\n\nDopex’s new release, Curve [Interest Rate Options](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-papers-interest-rate-options-retail) (IRO), are financial derivatives where the underlying asset is the yield on any Curve liquidity pool. They’re like their TradFi [counterparts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateoptions.asp), but they’re permissionless and entirely on-chain. Like traditional options, traders have the ability to purchase existing contracts or write their own calls and puts, where the writer has complete freedom in specifying strikes, spots, expiry dates, and leverage. They are the latest addition to the Curve ecosystem and make it even more sophisticated.\n\nWhy do these work?\n\nYields on Curve pools are so unpredictable—yet so integral—to cash flow. For example, while increases in a pool’s liquidity (TVL) are always welcomed, they may dilute yields to an individual if emission allocations are held constant. Admittedly, gauge votes can solve this problem, but no gauge is ever guaranteed a larger piece of the emissions pie. Further, Curve APYs are subject to the price of Curve, which goes up or down with some correlation to the macro environment.\n\nCurve IROs normalize these externalities. With a simple [strategy](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-papers-interest-rate-options-retail), protocols and individuals can hedge against losses incurred by weaker pools, or even vote strategically to equalize information asymmetry. Curve IROs are a tool to remove some of the uncertainty from gauge votes, and where uncertainty remains, they are a tool to capitalize on it.\n\n**But IROs run deeper than just hedging.** If you want to truly unlock the full potential of IROs, a strategic combination with the Pitch meta-governance ecosystem is in order.\n\n## Vote-Incentive Strategies with Pitch\n\nLast week, we [wrote](https://mirror.xyz/0xfceEF8F8C8fF6CeD87EB8F92B972F3fCdE3230B4/DkwEnkk7MVESb2nAz2tSaBANU5Mn8LRGv45n_5HwG6E) about how the incentives economy wields the power to alter human incentive structures in DeFi governance. This week, we expand on this idea by noting the incentive economy’s ability to help participants leverage information asymmetry. This is made possible by combining Dopex’s IROs with Pitch’s incentives marketplace and staking services. Indeed, Dopex IROs can augment liquidity pool yields earned from pitched incentives and may subsidize gauge vote costs. \n\n**A simple workflow of this two-prong process illustrates our point.** \n\nSuppose Protocol A occupies 10% of the Curve emissions gauge and is seeking to gain 11%: a net 1% increase. It may turn to Pitch to incentivize veCRV holders to vote for its gauge. We may further assume that Protocol A is relatively confident in its ability to sway the gauge weight with this method, and is thus expecting higher APYs for its liquidity providers.\n\nHowever, to further boost its gains, Protocol A may buy calls on its LP yields, thus offering the protocol a dynamic settlement reward provided the option expires in the money. Protocol A is, in effect, leveraging its yields while minimizing direct exposure to large losses that come with typical leveraging. Protocol A could augment this strategy by buying puts on other gauges that it suspects will see decreased yields resulting from Protocol A’s gains.\n\nNow suppose that the epoch has ended and the option has, in fact, expired in the money. Protocol A has **increased its relative gauge weight**, **increased its yield**, **disbursed voting rewards on Pitch**, and **will enjoy the settlement rewards from the successful call option**. A converse strategy could be used to hedge this yield as well.\n\nThus, the strategic marriage between Pitch and IROs accomplished a few things. \n\n* As normal, *Protocol A* increased its gauge weight by incentivizing gauge votes in its favor using Pitch’s governance console\n* Unlike before, however, *Protocol A* safely and effectively leveraged these gains with call options, collecting settlement rewards as well.\n* And, *Protocol A* has protected itself against information asymmetry by hedging in both directions, speculating on increases in its own yield and decreases in other gauges’ yield, too. \n* Finally, by leveraging IROs with the Pitch incentives marketplace, *Protocol A* enjoys its significant advantage over other protocols vying for emissions who are pitching and earning yield conventionally. ** \n **\n\nThe use of Pitch’s vote incentives marketplace, staking services, and IROs provided *Protocol A* with previously unseen **vote-incentive strategies**. This is capital that may then be transferred to the Frax ecosystem as pitchFXS or used for further incentives on our platform, furthering the flywheel. \n\n## Why Now?\n\nWith the FRAXBP now live and new metapools surfacing weekly, there is no better time to use this strategic workflow than now. It comes at a time where risk mitigation is crucial and market intelligence is paramount. The Pitch-IRO synergy provides both of these benefits. But the benefits extend to DeFi more broadly, too.  \n\n### Advantages to All, Both Big and Small\n\nFirst, it is good for the big and small players by making the risks of information asymmetry less costly. This is particularly important for individual voters who cannot bear the costs of miscalculations due to faulty market intelligence. For larger players, it minimizes the risk of an unsuccessful incentivization campaign. For example, if *Protocol A* does not increase its Curve APY, it can hedge the loss with puts on that same pool.\n\nSecond, the Pitch-IRO symbiosis encourages more vote incentivization than seen currently. Regular pitches can become extremely costly, but by leveraging IROs with strategic incentives, protocols reduce their overall cost of pitching by increasing profitability at the end. Vote incentives increase the likelihood that a protocol receives a larger share of Curve emissions, but pairing IROs with the pitch means that protocols can hedge their losses, increasing the stability of the strategy and contributing to its longevity. \n\nPlus, the revenue stream from ITM options could entirely subsidize future pitches, meaning a protocol would not need to think twice about incentivizing with large rewards on a regular basis. \n\n### Vitalizing a New Economy\n\nIROs affect people not involved with gauge voting or their incentives at all – it creates an entirely new options economy. Anyone who holds the underlying assets—in this case, LP tokens—wields the power to sell contracts to protocols looking to augment their gauge vote yields, further intertwining the meta-governance and IRO economies.\n\nThese individuals—or even DAOs—would link two booming sectors in DeFi to spark and sustain innovation in both spaces. This would pay off immensely for all those involved. Writers earn sizable notional premiums and slashed deposit rates with generous opportunities for leverage — up to 500x. Options writing creates additional income for liquidity providers on top of the yield and boost they receive simply for providing liquidity. Using IROs in the incentives marketplace thus allows providers to exercise their LP tokens beyond lending and trading.\n\nThe Pitch-IRO symbiosis combines two existing and tested technologies to further enhance DeFi governance, letting protocols and users hedge and/or leverage their bets on the future of liquidity.\n\nHow will you be pitching next epoch?\n\n## Learn More\n\nWe’re a group of open-source contributors and actively encourage members of the community to get involved.

Source: TradingView*\n\nAs the debate about the market's direction continues to rage, here are the important levels to watch heading into the weekend, according to analysts.\n\n## Bitcoin needs weekly close above $22,800\n\nThe significance of Bitcoin trading above its 200-week MA was noted by independent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who [posted](https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1550452397213995009) the following chart highlighting the major support and resistance zones:\n\n*BTC/USDT 1-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nAccording to van de Poppe, Bitcoin is “facing crucial resistance again” at $23,500, and what happens next will determine if its price heads higher or pulls back to support at $21,500. He explained:\n\n> “If that breaks at $23.8K, I'm assuming we'll continue and then $28K is on the tables, but we also have a clear breakout above the 200-Week MA confirmed.”\n\nThe importance of BTC holding above the 200-week MA was further addressed by market analyst Rekt Capital, who highlighted the need for Bitcoin to see a weekly close above $22,800:\n\n## Anticipating a big move\n\nThe recent price action is a sign that “a big move for #BTC is going to happen soon,” according to crypto trader and pseudonymous Twitter user CryptoGodJohn, who [provided](https://twitter.com/CryptoGodJohn/status/1550489630377742337) the following chart outlining two possible paths Bitcoin could take:\n\n*BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nCryptoGodJohn said:\n\n> “Break above and hold $24,200. I think we squeeze to $27K–$28K fairly quickly. If we start accepting back into the range, I am looking for a flush down to $20K. Pretty easy invalidation on both, stay safe.”\n\n***Related: [Pro Bitcoin traders are uncomfortable with bullish positions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-bitcoin-traders-are-uncomfortable-with-bullish-positions)***\n\nThe possibility of a move in either direction was also noted by the Twitter user Mayne, who [posted](https://twitter.com/Tradermayne/status/1550330046774140929) the following chart addressing the “potential range break out” for Bitcoin.\n\n*BTC/USD 12-hour chart. Source: Twitter*\n\nThey further explained: “Upside could be juicy if we can hold above $22.5k/range high. Lose the range high, this was likely a deviation. The move above range high becomes your risk as you target shorts back into the range.”\n\n## Keeping it simple\n\nFor those who are more inclined to accumulate and hodl as opposed to focusing on the day-to-day price movements of Bitcoin, market analyst Caleb Franzen offered the following insight to when it would be a good time to dollar-cost average:\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.048 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42%.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

This information could include your IP address, operating system, and geography.\n\nAll it takes is the creator placing an image URL in the NFT ‘s metadata that points to a machine they control that logs the request. Many web servers like Apache and NGINX can do this by default. The team at HOPR have created a series of Non-Private NFTs that show this vulnerability.\n\n> Note: this is in addition to the data a wallet like MetaMask leaks to RPC providers. You can learn more about this by checking out [DERP (Dumb Ethereum RPC Provider)](https://derp.hoprnet.org/) from the HOPR team.\n\nYou can see them generated live at their [Non-Private NFT](https://non-private-nft.hoprnet.org/) tool. They have a great post on explaining how it works and why it’s bad: [Your NFT Might be Watching You](https://medium.com/hoprnet/your-nft-might-be-watching-you-8c7ec078788f). They also have a [Non-Private NFT](https://github.com/hoprnet/non-private-nft) GitHub repo that shows how the collection could work.\n\nBelow, you can see a NFT I generated using the tool. I viewed the NFT three different ways: in my MetaMask wallet on Android, directly in Chrome, and on OpenSea.\n\n![When viewed in MetaMask on Android](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2KfGI8ulE0Q7BBJNE0fbk.png?height=900&width=600)\n\n![When viewed directly in Chrome on my laptop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0bm3nCSWYWVcLoBwuQc9L.png?height=900&width=600)\n\n![When viewed on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fbmhUMspXFlNRhjIe6ro9.png?height=900&width=600)\n\nIn the first two examples, the NFT shows my actual information. However, the OpenSea example is a different since their servers cache and serve the image. In that case, it shows the information of the AWS server OpenSea used to request the image. In each case, you can see the information is different.\n\nYou can see these NFT images generated live using HOPR’s [Non-Private NFT](https://non-private-nft.hoprnet.org/) tool. There’s a great Medium post explaining how it works and why it’s bad: [Your NFT Might be Watching You](https://medium.com/hoprnet/your-nft-might-be-watching-you-8c7ec078788f). There’s a corresponding [Non-Private NFT](https://github.com/hoprnet/non-private-nft) GitHub repo that shows how the collection could work.\n\nThis is a pretty clear case to demonstrate the need for web3 metadata privacy. Luckily, there are web3 privacy projects in the works to address this. One of which is HOPR, an incentivized mixnet enabling privacy-preserving point-to-point data exchange. It can be compared to Tor but with incentives for noderunners.

{"id": "qIWG89vJPp5DlJF25XiMFR905K3RCYxeOnYRJGn26xs", "title": "W jaki sposób nauka może pomóc odnaleźć sens życia?", "body": "## Skąd ten kryzys?\n\nWiększość z nas fantazjuje o zrobieniu czegoś, co całkowicie odmieni nasze życie. To fantazja o podjęciu odpowiedniej decyzji, założeniu biznesu czy dokonaniu rewolucyjnego odkrycia naukowego. Wolność wyboru i władza, jaką mamy nad samym sobą, jest największym skarbem ludzkości. Poczucie wolności pojawia się w momentach, w których dostrzegamy, jaką moc mają nasze czyny i jak wielką odpowiedzialność trzymamy we własnych rękach. Jesteśmy panami swojej rzeczywistości. Możemy zmienić w niej wszystko. Jednak z czasem owe uczucie wolności może stać się przekleństwem, może przybrać formę przerażenia i paniki. Wraz z możliwością wyboru pojawia się odpowiedzialność, a z odpowiedzialnością – presja i niepokój. Tylko my sami możemy obrać własną ścieżkę w życiu, ustanowić autonomiczny system wartości, zbudować spójną tożsamość. Nie możemy nikogo winić za obranie niewłaściwego kierunku.\n\nWewnętrzne konflikty, poczucie pustki i lęku związane z celowością życia często prowadzą do kryzysów emocjonalno-egzystencjalnych. Taki rodzaj stresu zmusza jednostkę do aktywacji różnych mechanizmów obronnych. Powrót do „normalności” wymaga ponownej oceny sposobów myślenia i działania, co wiąże się ze zmianą tożsamości. Aby zapobiec przerażającej wizji transformacji, uciekamy w pustkę, stan „nie-bycia”. Wybieramy zautomatyzowane życie pozbawione refleksji. Zaprzestajemy używania świadomego rozumu, inaczej: systemu drugiego. Utrwala się modularność globalnej sieci roboczej, promując kompulsywne zachowania. Taki wybór ma zapobiec utracie energii życiowej oraz spowodować ucieczkę od dyskomfortu odczuwanego przy wykonywaniu złożonych zadań. Zamiast wymagającej poznawczo eksploracji, nieustannie eksploatujemy dobrze nam znaną rzeczywistość, korzystając z automatycznego i nieświadomego systemu pierwszego. Większość podejmowanych działań jest obarczona błędami poznawczymi (cognitive bias) – nieracjonalnymi wzorcami postrzegania świata, opartymi na pozarozumowej wiedzy. Gdy przestajemy używać rozumu, oddajemy swoją wolność. A z pewnością znajdzie się ktoś, kto chętnie nam tę wolność odbierze, dając w zamian poczucie złudnego bezpieczeństwa. \n\nŻyjemy w czasach, w których promowane są konsumpcjonizm i natychmiastowa gratyfikacja. Niekończący się wyścig szczurów ciągle trwa i zbiera żniwo. Zatracamy własną tożsamość w pogoni za karierą, wpadając w nowe choroby psychiczne związane z kryzysem egzystencji. Z pomocą przychodzi medycyna, która (z reguły) nie bada źródeł zaburzeń psychicznych, zwalcza jedynie objawy choroby, ordynując standardowy zestaw leków, których przyjmowanie często wiąże się z przykrymi efektami ubocznymi. Neuroleptyki czy leki z grupy SxRI mogą „spłaszczać” odczuwane emocje, powodować nadwagę i spadki libido. Spółki farmaceutyczne przygotowały również wspaniałe remedium dla ludzi ciężko chorych, wymagających szczególnej opieki. W aptekach znajdziemy cały arsenał leków mających właściwości narkotyzujące, które mogą silnie uzależniać zarówno psychicznie i fizycznie. Jeżeli pacjent nie odbędzie skutecznej terapii psychologicznej, to po odstawieniu leków choroba bardzo często powraca. Postępująca medykalizacja nie jest zjawiskiem budzącym większej kontrowersji w przestrzeni publicznej. Dostajemy natychmiastowe i skuteczne rozwiązanie kryzysów życiowych w postaci garści tabletek. I to jest super wygodne. \n\nTaki wypaczony styl życia jest promowany przez media, które są wykorzystywane przez polityków, firmy, korporacje, osoby publiczne i prywatne do osiągnięcia różnych celów: ekonomicznych, propagandowych lub nawet czysto dezinformacyjnych. Irracjonalność staje się narzędziem marketingowym. Media kształtują odruchowe postawy odbiorców w taki sposób, by poszukiwali oni przede wszystkim stymulacji emocjonalnej, a także wybierali formy proste, atrakcyjne i niewymagające wysiłku poznawczego. Emocje i szok są wykorzystywane do przyciągania uwagi. Panuje ogólny nadmiar treści i każdy te treści może redystrybuować – niezależnie od tego, czy są zgodne z prawdą, czy nie. Autorytetami dla społeczeństwa stają się influencerzy z social mediów. Podążanie własną ścieżką jest podkopywane autodestrukcyjnymi zachowaniami. \n\nKonstruowanie przekazów skłaniających do biernego, posłusznego odbioru sprawia, że ludzie w żaden sposób nie chcą weryfikować przekonań ani wchodzić w dyskusję, tylko przyjmują przekaz jako prawdę. Niestety już od najmłodszych lat życia człowieka wpaja się mu, że posłuszny i bezkrytyczny odbiór informacji przekazywany przez osoby przedstawiane jako autorytatywne to coś słusznego. Umiera kreatywność i sceptyczne podejście do przyjmowania informacji. Opinia „specjalistów” w kitlu całkowicie może wpłynąć na podejmowane decyzje i kształtowane opinie. Co gorsza, niektórzy ludzie są w stanie bezgranicznie uwierzyć w słowa „specjalistów” w sutannach, strojach rytualnych czy jeszcze innych szatach czarnoksiężników. Ale dzięki temu nie trzeba szukać trudnych rozwiązań na skomplikowane problemy. A to jest super łatwe i przyjemne. \n\nNasz brak umiejętności realizacji swoich celów prowadzi do uciekania się w fikcję i nieprawdopodobne konstrukcje myślowe, byle tylko utrzymać ego w komfortowej pozycji. Błędne rozumienie świata może powodować w życiu ludzi niebezpieczne sytuacje i rozpowszechnianie irracjonalności, stąd już mały krok do zatracenia osobistej wolności i sensu życiowego.\n\n## Kognitywistyka jako emergentny, wielopoziomowy opis rzeczywistości\n\nPoczątkowo, w czasach starożytnych, poszukiwaniem odpowiedzi, które miały prowadzić do zrozumienia świata, zajmowali się filozofowie. Filozofia jest często ujmowana jako metadyscyplina – najbardziej ogólna z dziedzin wiedzy, wyznaczająca ich podstawy metodologiczne i warunki funkcjonowania (w starożytności nie było podziału między filozofią a nauką). Filozofia rozumiana jako nauka stawia sobie za zadanie prawdziwe poznanie danego przedmiotu. Z tak rozumianej filozofii wywodzą się współczesne szczegółowe dyscypliny naukowe. Pojęcie filozofii oznacza szeroko rozumianą ciekawość intelektualną i poszukiwanie wiedzy. Już od czasów starożytności ludzie próbowali zrozumieć prawa opisujące świat rzeczywisty i złożoność ludzkiego gatunku. Co istnieje? Co mogę wiedzieć? Co mogę zrozumieć? \n\nW odpowiedzi na współczesne pytania związane z funkcjonowaniem umysłu powstała nowa dziedzina nauki: kognitywistyka. Jej głównym wyzwaniem jest integracja wiedzy, znalezienie „mostu” łączącego różne paradygmaty opisu ludzkiego umysłu . Kognitywistyka czerpie m.in. z antropologii, psychologii, lingwistyki, neuronauk. Wykorzystuje również uczenie maszynowe i algorytmiczną teorię grafów. Każda z wymienionych dziedzin wykorzystuje różną metodologię i posiada własną terminologię. Nauki kognitywne badają podobieństwa zachodzące między integrowanymi dziedzinami, jednocześnie zachowując spójną metodologię, której ramy konceptualne są wyznaczane dzięki dyskursowi filozoficznemu. \n\nZarówno zagadki nauk kognitywnych, jak i złożone problemy życiowe wymagają myślenia, dzięki któremu możemy znaleźć rozwiązanie. To myślenie to przekształcenia dokonywane na umysłowych reprezentacjach świata. W tym sensie myślenie zastępuje działanie - pozwala na symulowanie wydarzeń rozgrywających się w świecie realnym, bez negatywnych, ale i pozytywnych konsekwencji typowych dla rzeczywistego zachowania. Myślenie jest jednym z narzędzi budowania modeli mentalnych i opisów rzeczywistości zawierających m.in alternatywne wersje wydarzeń, które mogłyby być skutkiem podjęcia określonych działań. \n\nWykonywanie czynności angażujących poznawczo, w tym konstruowanie wspomnianych symulacji mentalnych, mocno integruje sieć funkcjonalną mózgu. Jest to proces przyswajania nowych informacji. Powtarzając systematycznie określone działanie, sieć w stanie segregacji (spoczynku) zwiększa modularność sieci, dzięki czemu „zapisujemy” naszą skonstruowaną reprezentację, a jej przywołanie w przyszłości nie będzie wymagało ponawiania kosztownej integracji sieci. \n\nTworząc nowe pojęcia, prowadząc badania, szukamy złożonych wzorów, które pomagają nam opisać rzeczywistość w nowy sposób. Kognitywistyka poszukuje interakcji i podobieństw w różnych opisach funkcjonowania ludzkiego umysłu. Im więcej takich modeli i im bardziej przystają one do rzeczywistości, tym większe jest prawdopodobieństwo podjęcia optymalnego działania prowadzącego do zmiany paradygmatu. Naukę (w bardzo uproszczony sposób) można opisać jako nieustanny proces konstruowania wzorów lub pojęć (output_1) wyprowadzanych z istniejących już danych (input_1). Następnie nasz (output_1) staje się (inputem_2), z którego wyprowadzamy (output_2) itd. Jest to również powtarzający się cykl integracji-segregacji sieci naszego mózgu. Z mniejszych systemów pojęć i koncepcji wyłaniają się nowe, znaczące patterny, które pomagają nam w głębszym zrozumieniu rzeczywistości. \n\nZgodnie z ujęciem emergencji w trakcie rozwoju świata powstają raptownie i nieprzewidywalnie nowe jakości o coraz większym stopniu organizacji, tworzące hierarchiczny układ. Wyższe jakości wyłaniają się z niższych, jednak nie dają się do nich sprowadzić, gdyż posiadają swoiste cechy. Zjawiska emergentne powstają po osiągnięciu przez system pewnego progu złożoności, powiązań lub organizacji. Pozwala to tłumaczyć takie zjawiska, jak inteligencja. Może ona wynikać z oddziaływania pomiędzy bardzo wieloma prostymi neuronami. \n\nŚwiat widziany z naukowej i filozoficznej perspektywy jest hierarchicznie ustrukturyzowany. Procesy prowadzące do powstania złożonych, samoorganizujących się układów hierarchicznych (fizycznych, chemicznych, neuronalnych, biologicznych) generowane są przez ewolucyjne zasady samoorganizacji. Na różnych poziomach spotykamy różne rodzaje prawidłowości i relacji przyczynowo-skutkowych. To samo dotyczy własności umysłowych człowieka. Nie pojawiają się one znikąd, lecz powstają w długotrwałym procesie ewolucyjnym. Zrozumienie natury relacji między mózgiem a poszczególnymi funkcjami umysłowymi nie jest możliwe bez uwzględnienia ewolucji i zasad działania samego mózgu. \n\nEmergentne spojrzenie na mózg jako sieć interakcji może przyczynić się do lepszego zrozumienia naszych umysłów, a w rezultacie – otaczającej nas rzeczywistości. Zrozumienie jest dobrą podstawą do kultywowania mądrości i racjonalności.\n\n## Psychotechnologie i nauka jako antykryzysowe tarcze\n\nPodczas procesu „wybudzania się” z kryzysu znaczeniowego, opisywanego przez Johna Vervaeke, podkreśla on kluczowość wykorzystywania psychotechnologii: zinternalizowanych sposobów na zapisywanie, przetwarzanie informacji a także poszerzanie zasobów poznawczych. To właśnie dzięki wykorzystaniu psychotechnologii, jak umiejętność pisania, czytania, liczenia, posługiwania się symbolami, możemy zapisywać, przekazywać i korygować nasze procesy myślowe. Stajemy się bardziej świadomi swoich procesów mentalnych. Dzięki wynalezieniu pisma mamy dostęp do skumulowanej wiedzy przekazywanej z pokolenia na pokolenie. Możemy wytwarzać ulepszone narzędzia i technologie, które pozwalają nam na pogłębienie naszej wiedzy dotyczącej rzeczywistości i natury umysłu. Ludzkość staje się mądrzejsza i może polegać na naukowym, racjonalnym opisie świata, który nadaje wiarygodność nowym odkryciom. Rozwija się racjonalność, czyli zdolność do wykorzystywania zgromadzonych informacji do osiągania celów. \n\nJedną z psychotechnologii, która powstała w celu przezwyciężenia kryzysu pustki życiowej, jest vipassana: buddyjska medytacja wglądu, esencja nauk Buddy. Dzięki utrzymywaniu świadomości na wewnętrznych doznaniach cielesnych doświadczamy zjawiska „wglądu” (insight). Podczas praktyki vipassany zmniejsza się aktywność naszej domyślnej sieci roboczej. \n\nOdmiennym sposobem poszerzania swojego „cognitive capacity” jest praktyka kontemplacji, która może być porównywana do zjawiska „mind-wandering”. W przeciwieństwie do vipassany skupia się ona na eksternalizacji naszych myśli, „wychodzeniu” do otaczającego świata i spontanicznym oglądzie rzeczywistości. Nie jest to myślenie ukierunkowane na konkretny cel. Podczas praktyki kontemplacji zwiększa się aktywność sieci domyślnej. Może to prowadzić do spontanicznej integracji niektórych sieci, co będzie ułatwiało nam „przestawianie się” na myślenie zorientowane na konkretnym celu i zwiększało kontrolę nad procesami myślowymi. \n\nUmiejętność aktywnego przełączania się między segregacją i integracją jest nazywana stanem flow – stanem całkowitego skupienia na jakiejś czynności, pozytywnym zatraceniu się w chwili obecnej. Stan flow może być odmiennym, wyższym stanem świadomości, bliskim transcendencji, w którym istnienie przedmiotu poznania jest poza umysłem poznającym. \n\nStan flow kojarzy mi się z psychodelicznymi doświadczeniami, podczas których sieć się integruje i segreguje jednocześnie. Istotna staje się wówczs tylko chwila teraźniejsza i nasze wewnętrzne doznania. Jednocześnie wychodzenie myślami poza własną egzystencję jest bardzo proste, wręcz domyślne. Psychodeliczne doświadczenie to tymczasowy stan, który stawia przed nami wyzwanie radykalnej transformacji. Przebywając tu i teraz, możemy rozmyślać nad złożonością rzeczywistości (kompromis między integracją a segregacją sieci). Czasem nie musimy używać kontroli poznawczej, czasem działamy jakby zaprogramowani przez „wyższą świadomość”. Przykładowo: nie potrzebujemy kontroli poznawczej, żeby powstrzymać się przed spożyciem przetworzonego jedzenia, tak jakby wgrano nam wzorzec, który domyślnie „rozumie”, że nie jest to odpowiedni pokarm dla „przebudzonego człowieka” (choć w rzeczywistości lubię smak czipsów). Ale chwila: można przecież powiedzieć: „Nie potrzebuję żadnych substancji psychoaktywnych, by wiedzieć, że czipsy są niezdrowe”. Jednak przebywanie w stanie odmiennej świadomości sprawia, że nasz wgląd jest przytłaczająco oczywisty, dzięki czemu wywiera głębszy wpływ na różne sfery egzystencji (w tym przypadku na wybór odpowiedniego sposobu odżywiania się). \n\nCelem stosowania różnych psychotechnologii, szukania odmiennych stanów świadomości i wglądu jest poznanie samego siebie oraz wykształcenie umiejętności określenia tego, co nam się podoba i czego pragniemy. To dzięki „większej” przestrzeni i otwartości umysłu jesteśmy w stanie odszukiwać, formułować i rozwiązywać nowe problemy. Nabywamy umiejętności do wyszukiwania wartościowych informacji, dzięki którym rozumiemy świat (i samych siebie) w bardziej wysublimowany sposób. Zaczynamy dostrzegać wielowymiarowość pewnych aspektów rzeczywistości. Zdobywamy rozsądek i „wewnętrzną mądrość” – zaczynamy rozumieć, co nas unosi, a co ciągnie na dno. \n\nAby dotrzeć do celu, powinniśmy nauczyć się również cierpliwości. To doświadczenie, które płynie z przeżyć i rozczarowań, czyni nas silniejszymi. Nie jest ono stałym punktem, lecz drogą, która kształtuje nasz los. Liczy się to, by nie powtarzać identycznych błędów, obejmować porażki świadomością i stale się rozwijać. Przekraczać własne granice, by stać się tym, kim naprawdę chce się być. Prawdopodobnie tworzenie lepszej przyszłości jest sensem życia. Racjonalny świat nauki powinien pomóc odkryć ten sens każdemu, kto jeszcze go nie znalazł. Tego właśnie życzę nam wszystkim.", "timestamp": 1658535177, "digest": "10t2cCqHf-fWn3rZf05EXc__JHDTliodMWc0Zj2HALo", "contributor": "0x58134e52A6cd119b46F62c4f6612Df56e9ad8E8f"}

Media报道，韩国科技巨头Hancom旗下加密子公司Arowana Hub推出的加密项目遭遇诉讼，Arowana Coin代币投资者面临大规模亏损风险。首尔中央地方法院6日接受了对Arowana Coin投资的普通投资者的债权临时扣押申请。因此，钱包管理人Hexlant保管的Arowana基金会所有的4.3亿多枚Arowana Coin被临时扣押，在诉讼结束之前这些代币禁止移动。普通投资者索赔的损失金额为800亿韩元（约合6089万美元）。如果投资者赢了，法院最多可以将5000万枚Arowana Coin代币在不锁仓的情况下转给投资者，并允许投资者在交易所出售。\n\n此前，投资者与Hancom签订了5000万枚Arowana Coin投资合同，并支付了这笔钱。Hancom曾承诺将在2021年代币上线交易所后将这些代币转移至投资者的钱包中，但并未兑现。Arowana Coin于2021年上线Bithumb交易所后，立即暴涨超1000%。投资人声称，就算是按照Arowana Coin最低价计算，损失金额也达到了1156亿韩元（约合8799万美元）。而投资者与Hancom的代币投资合同发生纠纷，Bithumb对此未进行披露，被质疑没有对投资者采取保护措施。据悉，Arowana (ARW) 项目是一个处理黄金等实物资产价值的区块链平台，有人怀疑金Arowana Coin被用于为Hancom董事长金相哲筹集行贿资金，调查仍在进行中。Hancom公司随后对法院扣押资金一事提出异议，称申请临时扣押的投资者与Aronawa Hub没有债务关系。\n\n[英国《金融时报》推出加密金融板块](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/p80uo24n.html)\n\n据FinanceFeeds报道，英国《金融时报》推出了Cryptofinance板块，这是一个集合加密货币报道的新的数字中心和每周通讯，旨在揭示数字资产行业以及创新如何影响主流金融。\n\n[外媒：美国SEC官员回应称SEC尚未就BNB向币安发出传票](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/tu83e2yt.html)\n\n加密媒体CoinDesk根据《信息自由法》向SEC提交了一份“SEC就调查BNB代币向币安发出的传票”的请求被退回，但一位SEC官员在回复中写道：“根据你在信中提供的信息，我们对SEC的各种记录系统进行了彻底搜索，但没有找到或识别任何响应你请求的信息。”据悉，彭博社曾于6月份报道，美国SEC正在调查BNB代币是否为未注册的证券，对此赵长鹏回应币安就其产品与当局保持定期联系，并否认该公司已被传唤。\n\n[三箭资本创始人Su

Zhu在接受电话采访时表示：“一直躲藏且没有出席近期的一系列法庭活动是因为受到了死亡威胁，但这并不意味着我们没有与所有相关部门进行沟通，在事发后我们一直有保持联系。”两人拒绝透露他们在哪里，但电话中的一位律师表示，他们的最终目的地是阿拉伯联合酋长国。\n\n此外，Su Zhu和Kyle Davies描述了风险管理的系统性失败，宽松的流动信贷加剧了错误押注的影响。他们承认其失败为行业其他人引发的连锁反应造成了损失，但强调他们也遭受了巨大的损失，并对此感到懊悔，同时也否认了他们在危机爆发前从三箭资本撤资的指控。Su Zhu还表示，他们未预料到LUNA能在几天内跌至归零，并引发整个行业的信贷紧缩，从而对三箭所有流动性不足的头寸造成巨大压力。尽管如此，该基金仍能够继续从大型数字资产贷方和富有的投资者那里借款，直到这些机构本身陷入危机。在LUNA崩盘后，Su Zhu表示贷方对三箭资本的财务状况“感到满意”，并允许他们继续交易。\n\n对于外界质疑其“奢靡”的生活，Su Zhu表示：“此前传闻的破产之际支付5000万美元首付买游艇的消息不实，那艘游艇是1年前委托建造的，并且有完整的资金来源。我每天骑自行车上下班，和我的家人在新加坡只有两个家。出问题时总有人喜欢写出这样的新闻。”在回答有关该公司哪里出了问题时，Su Zhu提到了多年牛市带来的过度自信，牛市不仅注入了他和Davies的思维力，还注入了几乎所有的行业信贷基础设施，在这些领域，因为有像他这样的融资公司，贷方看到了他们的价值膨胀。\n\n[BlockFi第二季度透明度报告：有18亿美元未偿贷款，已制定流动性指导方案](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/h1584h4x.html)\n\n据Cointelegraph报道，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，截至第二季度末，公司拥有来自机构和散户投资者的18亿美元未偿贷款，其中6亿美元是无抵押贷款。机构贷款占未偿贷款总额的15亿美元，而散户贷款占剩余的3亿美元。\n\nBlockFi表示已经制定指导方案，以帮助其保持必要的流动性来履行核心业务活动，包括机构和零售借贷和交易活动。该指导方案将根据客户的需求在库存中持有至少10%的总金额，并准备好退还给客户。还将在可在7天内收回并返还给客户的地方持有至少50%的欠款，并将根据需要将欠客户总额的至少90%用于存货或可偿还的贷款中。这类贷款将在一年内召回。\n\n[Coinbase发布二季度投资备忘录，Web

V3正式部署至Celo网络，Celo也为自己的生态吸引到了影响力最大的项目。借助于Uniswap的深度、无许可性以及集中流动性架构，Celo将在其上构建与碳信用代币相关的流动性池，以提升碳市场的资本流动性，同时也为其他协议在Celo上整合碳信用打下基础，第一个流动性池将是Moss碳信用代币池CELO/MCO2。\n\n与很多面向所有市场的Layer1的公链不同，Celo定位是一条主打去中心化移动支付的区块链网络，其主网于2020年4月正式上线，旨在让全球没有银行账户的用户也能够通过手机等移动设备享受DeFi产品所带来的便利性，所以非洲和诸多欠发达国家是其市场重点。除了采用PoS共识机制、兼容EVM、具有跨链互操作性外，其特点还包括以稳定币作为汇款、跨境支付等交易媒介、支持多种代币支付Gas费、将电话号码映射到钱包地址以简化转账操作等。2021年4月，欧洲最大的电信运营商德国电信公司宣布对Celo进行投资，此前的投资机构还包括a16z、Coinbase Ventures、Electric Capital、Jack Dorsey等。\n\n除了推动去中心化金融的发展外，Celo还致力于为环保事业做出贡献，此次和Uniswap“结盟”也是为了共同推进ReFi（Regenerative Finance）的发展。顾名思义，ReFi指的是可再生金融，旨在通过Web3技术扭转气候变化，即利用区块链技术的透明机制，将现实中的自然资产引入链上，同时引入激励机制，对绿色发展作出贡献的行为进行奖励，以推动可持续性发展。据Celo基金会估计，ReFi将是一个万亿规模的经济市场，目前最常见的ReFi项目就是碳信用代币化类，比如Toucan、Flow Carbon和Moss等，Celo也与上述项目建立了合作关系，而碳信用代币的流动性问题是当下面临的挑战之一，此次Celo与Uniswap的合作也是为了提升该市场的资本效率。ReFi是一个全新叙事，PANews也对其进行了深度解读[“万字长文解读ReFi：全新的Web3叙事范式，可编程的经济循环”](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/0wbr3ltq.html)。\n\n据PANews统计，目前

{"id": "rD23dT3adYbMpSGK8QNDIPI350WuauchVe9Hqca-hT0", "title": "Building a Stable Platform", "body": "As the dust has begun to (hopefully) settle on the crypto crash, people have begun sorting through the rubble to figure out which products from this last cycle were useful and real, and which were hypes and ponzis. I’ve thrown my hat into this ring too many times, including two pieces on web3 use cases: Today and in the Future.\n\nOne category that seems to be unanimously viewed as useful, outside of the most skeptical skeptics, is stablecoins. It’s one of the use cases I highlighted a month ago. And among the stablecoins, the consensus seems to be that USDC is the stablest of them all.\n\nStablecoins are sneakily fascinating because they’re both a digital currency and a sort of platform on top of which new applications can be built, or old ones improved. But to achieve that promise, they need to actually be stable. A dollar-denominated stablecoin, like USDC, needs to be redeemable for a good ol’ fashioned US Dollar, every time, everywhere.\n\nIf a stablecoin can be trusted to perform that foundational obligation, then developers can begin to build financial products on modern digital rails. Sometimes, they’ll build entirely new applications, like DeFi protocols. Others, they’ll rip out pieces of old, creaky financial infrastructure and replace them with newer rails.\n\nThe revolution does not need to be total to be impactful. Circle is a case study in compromise. It’s a centralized company facilitating the growth of a decentralized financial system. It’s used by web2, web3, and web2.5 companies alike. It’s happy to sit in the background, facilitating fast, cheap, global payments and loans while others build shiny interfaces and sturdy guardrails on top.\n\nAfter seeing USDC’s outperformance during the bear market – its market cap has grown as the overall market has shrunk – and seeing a lot of people I respect point to USDC as a gold standard, I decided to team up with Circle to tell the story via a Sponsored Deep Dive. You can read more about how I choose which companies to work with on Sponsored Deep Dives here. In this case, I realized that I didn’t know nearly as much about stablecoins as I should, and I was pumped that they were willing to work with me to help understand and then explain.\n\nAs always: this is not financial or investment advice. I’m an idiot, and I’m learning as I go – you would be foolish to allocate your cash based on anything I write. Do your own research. But I hope that it’s an entertaining and informative look into one of crypto’s key building blocks.\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\nCircle & USDC: Building a Stable Platform\n(Click the link to read the full thing online)\n\nYes, I know. This newsletter is called Not Boring. But I’m going to start this essay off by showing you the Most Boring Chart in All of Crypto.\n\nCoinMarketCap\nThat’s the 1 year price chart of USD Coin (“USDC”), the fiat-backed, fully-collateralized, dollar-denominated stablecoin issued by Circle. I dare you to find me a more boring chart.\n\nFor the entire past year, as prices of other crypto assets rollercoastered up and down and up and very down, USDC hugged the $1 line tightly. 🥱\n\nFor stablecoins, boring is good. Boring is the goal. And being the most boring stablecoin results in a chart that isn’t very boring at all:\n\nCoinMarketCap (Click “Market Cap” on the Chart)\nThat’s USDC’s market cap since its inception in October 2018, which represents the total USDC in circulation. At the time of writing, July 20th, 2022, that number stands at $54.8 billion. Circulating USDC has more than doubled in the past year, after growing 25x between July 2020 and July 2021. Since its price is pegged to $1, increases in market cap mean that there’s more usage of USDC (the inverse is also true – the market cap declines when people redeem their USDC for Dollars).\n\nBoring is a feature, not a bug. It’s key to Circle’s first product value proposition – digital dollars – and it’s key to Circle’s mission: To raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value.\n\nIf you’ve heard of Circle, it’s likely because of USDC. That’s the company’s first killer product. Recently, it announced that it’s launching a second, Euro Coin (EUROC).\n\nBut thinking about USDC and EUROC as just stablecoins misses the company’s ambitions to become:\n\nThe platform on top of which developers build a new financial system\n\nThe digital currency of choice institutional investors leverage for trading and settlement\n\nA tool that enables the frictionless, borderless exchange of value\n\nIt’s an ambitious bet in a competitive space, and one dogged by both valid and invalid concerns, many of which we’ll cover in this piece. Circle is trying to differentiate on trust, the necessary foundation for its ambitions. Increasingly, it seems to be working.\n\nI didn’t give much thought to stablecoins until Luna’s UST blew up a couple of months ago. But as I’ve dug in, I’ve realized that they’re one of the most solid use cases in web3 today, and a fundamental building block in the much bigger visions entrepreneurs in the space are building towards. Once the idea of programmable, permissionless money worms into your brain, it’s hard to see where stablecoins wouldn’t provide an improvement over the status quo.\n\nBut let’s start with the basics and build up from there:\n\nWhat are stablecoins?\n\nHow do stablecoin issuers generate revenue?\n\nWhy are stablecoins a valuable primitive?\n\nHow are USDC and Circle a platform?\n\nWhat is Circle’s competitive advantage?\n\nWhat would a new financial system built on Circle’s rails look like?\n\nWhat Are Stablecoins?\nIf you’ve followed the crypto markets recently, you might’ve heard the word “stablecoin” and chuckled. “Stablecoin, huh?” you’d quip, “Not very … stable 😂.” It’s a funny joke.\n\nCoinMarketCap\nIn May, UST (Terra’s stablecoin) lost its peg to the dollar (translation: it became worth less than $1). It flushed hard, bringing the entire Luna ecosystem down with it. Ultimately, it brought down crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (“3AC”) which contributed to the downfall of Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and other Centralized Finance (“CeFi”) lenders. Friend of the newsletter Jon Wu wrote a great thread / Not Boring essay on Terra-Luna and UST, and Arthur Hayes wrote the definitive piece on the 3AC collapse in case you want to read more gory details.\n\nThe UST situation brought to light something that was apparent to anyone who dug into the math or simply walked through the logic: not all stablecoins are created equal. Not all stablecoins are … stable.\n\nThe goal of a stablecoin is to stay pegged to its reference asset. For most stablecoins, that’s the US Dollar. So one (1) USD stablecoin – like USDC – should be worth $1. As Alex Danco wrote in 2018:\n\nThe crucial test that any stablecoin must pass for the market to actually trust it is: if a user wants to redeem their stablecoins for genuine dollars, under any reasonable circumstance, can they do so?\n\n“Reasonable” is doing a lot of work here. People should always be able to redeem their stablecoins for genuine dollars. There are three main models stablecoin issuers pursue to make that happen:\n\nFiat-Backed\n\nCryptocurrency-Backed\n\nAlgorithmic\n\nWe’ll start last, first. Algorithmic stablecoins, like UST, aren’t backed by dollars, a basket of cryptos, commodities, or anything, really, outside of what they create themselves.\n\nInstead of explaining this insanity myself, I’ll turn it over to the inimitable Matt Levine:\n\nHere is how an algorithmic stablecoin works:\n\nYou wake up one morning and invent two crypto tokens.\n\nOne of them is the stablecoin, which I will call “Terra,” for reasons that will become apparent.\n\nThe other one is not the stablecoin. I will call it “Luna.”\n\nTo be clear, they are both just things you made up, just numbers on a ledger. (Probably the ledger is maintained on a decentralized blockchain, though in theory you could do this on your computer in Excel.)\n\nYou try to find people to buy them.\n\nLuna will trade at some price determined by supply and demand. If you make it up on your computer and keep the list in Excel and smirk when you tell people about this, that price will be zero, and none of this will work.\n\nBut if you do a good job of marketing Luna, that price will not be zero. If the price is not zero then you’re in business.\n\nYou promise that people can always exchange one Terra for $1 worth of Luna. If Luna trades at $0.10, then one Terra will get you 10 Luna. If Luna trades at $20, then one Terra will get you 0.05 Luna. Doesn’t matter. The price of Luna is arbitrary, but one Terra always gets you $1 worth of Luna. (And vice versa: People can always exchange $1 worth of Luna for one Terra.)\n\nYou set up an automated smart contract — the “algorithm” in “algorithmic stablecoin” — to let people exchange their Terras for Lunas and Lunas for Terras.\n\nTerra should trade at $1. If it trades above $1, people — arbitrageurs — can buy $1 worth of Luna for $1 and exchange them for one Terra worth more than a dollar, for an instant profit. If it trades below $1, people can buy one Terra for less than a dollar and exchange it for $1 worth of Luna, for an instant profit. These arbitrage trades push the price of Terra back to $1 if it ever goes higher or lower.\n\nThe price of Luna will fluctuate. Over time, as trust in this ecosystem grows, it will probably mostly go up. But that is not essential to the stablecoin concept. As long as Luna robustly has a non-zero value, you can exchange one Terra for some quantity of Luna that is worth $1, which means Terra should be worth $1, which means that its value should be stable.\n\n“All of this is,” Levine writes, “quite straightforward and correct, except for Point 7, which is insane.” $UST and $LUNA rose in tandem, and they fell in tandem.\n\nAfter UST’s collapse, the market for algorithmic stablecoins will likely be muted for a long time, so we don’t need to spend more time here.\n\nCryptocurrency-backed stablecoins are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies and are typically overcollateralized, meaning that the dollar value of cryptocurrencies in the reserve exceeds the dollar value of stablecoins outstanding. They achieve this by requiring each user to deposit more in another token, like ETH or BTC, than they pull out in stablecoin.\n\nThe leading example here is MakerDAO’s stablecoin, DAI, with a $7.2 billion market cap.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nA user who wants to take out a loan opens a Vault by sending ERC-20 tokens like ETH, Wrapped BTC, and USDC to the smart contract and receives DAI in return.\n\nDAI borrowing is overcollateralized, meaning that you need to put in a higher dollar value in your ERC-20 token of choice than you take out in DAI, with higher collateral ratios depending on the volatility and liquidity of the token you deposit. Currently, ETH has a minimum collateral ratio of 170%, Wrapped BTC of 175%, and Staked ETH of 185%.\n\nAt any time, you can deposit your DAI back in and unlock the ERC-20 you’d locked up.\n\nIf, however, the price of your ERC-20 of choice drops to a point that breaks the minimum collateral ratio, Maker will liquidate you, or sell your tokens.\n\nThe disadvantage of borrowing DAI is that you need to put up a lot of collateral – currently, to borrow DAI with ETH requires a minimum collateral ratio of 170%, meaning I’d need to put in at least $17,000 worth of ETH to get 10,000 DAI. I also have to pay a Variable Annual Fee, currently at 0.50% for ETH deposits.\n\nOasis App\nPlus, if the price of ETH drops to a point that breaks that ratio – in this case, if it drops even one cent – the smart contract liquidates me by selling the ETH. That could mean that you might be forced to sell at an inopportune time.\n\nThe advantage of DAI to the borrower is that it’s completely on-chain, without the need for a centralized intermediary, and works well with your existing crypto holdings. If you want to hold onto your ETH but take out a little walking around money, you can just lock up the ETH, get DAI, and use it for any of the things you might use stablecoins for.\n\nThe advantage of DAI as a protocol is that, by being overcollateralized and liquidating below certain thresholds, it can maintain stability and keep the promise that users can redeem their DAI for their ERC-20 tokens in any reasonable scenario.\n\nAs a result, even during the recent turmoil, DAI has held up well. DAI’s chart isn’t quite as boring as USDC’s, but it’s pretty boring:\n\nCoinMarketCap\nAt the time of writing, it’s trading at around $1.00, as designed.\n\nThere are other crypto-backed stablecoins that are pegged to the dollar, with more launching regularly, others pegged to assets besides the US Dollar, and others still that aren’t pegged to anything at all. Some just want to be reserve currencies themselves. OlympusDAO, for example, has a mix of tokens in its reserve, backing its “Future Decentralized Reserve Currency,” Ohm. If you’ve seen the (3,3) or (something, something) meme on Twitter, that comes from the game theory behind Ohm, that it’s better for everyone if everyone just stakes their Ohm and holds. Ohm has had a bumpy ride, falling from a peak of $420 to a current price of $52.\n\nThere are other promising crypto reserve currency projects, all vying to build an internet-native reserve that isn’t tied to the value of any fiat currency, but they’re different than stablecoins and outside the scope of this piece.\n\nThat brings us to fiat-backed stablecoins, like USDC.\n\nCircle’s USDC stablecoin is the most straightforward of the major stablecoins: for every dollar of USDC in circulation, Circle holds $1 worth of straight cash and US Treasury Bills, for which there is the deepest and most liquid market of any asset in the world.\n\nTwitter avatar for @WatcherGuru\nWatcher.Guru\n@WatcherGuru\nJUST IN: Circle says they hold 80% of their $USDC reserves in US Treasury bills and 20% in cash within the US banking system.\nJuly 5th 2022\n\n453 Retweets3,505 Likes\nIf you want to redeem 1 USDC for $1, no magic needs to happen. The dollar is sitting there, either right in the USDC reserve bank accounts at BNY Mellon and other large banks, or invested in short-term Treasuries that are easier than anything else in the world to exchange into dollars. Circle posts weekly reporting and monthly attestations on its website:\n\nCircle\nIn a recent interview, Circle CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen said that Circle’s customers “could redeem all of USDC in one day. We could process those redemptions, and the only limits to the time that they would get their U.S. dollars back are the limits in the settlement systems of the fiat currency banking system itself.”\n\nSome people – from pseudonymous Twitter accounts with 12 followers to journalist Matt Taibbi – have expressed concerns about Circle and USDC, ranging from the idea that centralized institutions cannot be trusted to issues with the structure of its agreement with BlackRock around the Circle Reserve Fund. The concerns boil down to whether or not there will always be a US Dollar available when a customer wants to redeem a USDC, which breaks down into whether Circle holds its reserve in the assets it says it does (Cash and short-term Treasuries) and whether Circle’s business operations and USDC reserves are separate.\n\nMany of these claims seem to stem from a misunderstanding of how USDC works, how reserves are held today, and the differences between USDC and Circle itself.\n\nAddressing the first point, whether Circle holds what it says it does, and where, and what exactly it holds, Circle has been very transparent with its holdings. In the past, it has held commercial paper, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Yankee CDs, but in September 2021, it moved all of its USDC reserves into cash and cash equivalents, per the 2021 Circle Examination Report by Grant Thornton.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the growth of stablecoins “has rightly brought significant federal regulatory attention” and that it would hold all USDC reserves in cash and short-duration US government treasuries “given our commitment to maintaining high standards, which in some cases go beyond those required by our regulators.”\n\nIn addition to monthly attestations and the annual audit, last week, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted a CUSIP-level breakdown of the reserve’s T-Bill holdings:\n\nTwitter avatar for @jerallaire\nJeremy Allaire\n@jerallaire\n1/ As part of our commitment to increasing transparency and disclosure around USDC, today we're publishing our first monthly breakdown of the USDC reserve assets, by each and every Treasury Bond and list of cash reserve custodians.circle.com/blog/providing…\nImage\nJuly 14th 2022\n\n545 Retweets2,780 Likes\nHe said that the company is working to get permission from banking partners to disclose how much it holds with each bank.\n\nOn the second, the separation between Circle’s business operations and USDC, Circle offers products that are separate from USDC, like APIs, SeedInvest, and Circle Yield. Given the recent meltdowns at Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and others, investors and commenters are most worried about Circle Yield, but Circle’s product is different in that it’s only available to institutional accredited investors. Currently, it offers very low rates.\n\nCircle Yield\nImportantly, Circle’s yield product doesn’t touch its USDC reserves. Circle doesn’t lend its USDC reserves to anyone, it lets institutional accredited investors earn yields on their own USDC.\n\nMore broadly, Circle has publicly stated that its USDC reserve funds are held for the benefit of USDC token holders: “Circle does not and will not use USDC holders’ money to run its business or pay its debts. These funds are in segregated accounts.”\n\nFurther, Circle is regulated as a Money Services Business and licensed under the rules and state money transmission licenses that govern major US payment institutions including Stripe, PayPal, and Apple.\n\nTo be clear, though: everything has risk. Theoretically, in my opinion, the biggest risk to USDC is that one of its bank partners completely implodes or the US Government defaults on its debt, in which case, God help us all. But it’s important to point out that even though USDC seems to be the most stable of the stablecoins, there are always risks and people always need to be careful with their money. The S-4 that Circle and Concord Acquisition Corp. filed with the SEC in relation to a proposed SPAC deal lists 23 risks on pages 29 and 30.  To be very clear: this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework.\n\nBased on conversations with investors and others in crypto, USDC is the most trusted stablecoin in the market. As one friend who’s deep in the bowels of the crypto trading community put it, “Anyone legit in the space holding stablecoins is holding USDC.”\n\nCurrently, there is $54.8 billion in USDC, which means it holds cash or Treasuries worth as much via its bank and custodian partners. Every year, Circle’s reserves are audited by a leading public accounting firm, and every month, accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP attests to the fact that it has as much or more in reserves as there are USDC outstanding.\n\nGrant Thornton LLP May 2022 Circle Attestation\nLike I said, boring. The most boring, even among fiat-backed fully-reserved stablecoins.\n\nTether, which issues the leading stablecoin by market cap, USDT, has come under fire numerous times over the years over concerns about what it does with the money it receives in exchange for USDT. Stripe’s Patrick Mackenzie and friend of the newsletter Alex Danco both wrote great overviews of Tether’s issues in 2019, Patrick’s here and Alex’s here. This whole 85k follower Twitter account, Bitfinex’ed, rose to prominence for calling out Tether. One of the most serious allegations against Tether is that its CFO, Giancarlo Devasini, used Tether reserves to plug a hole in crypto exchange Bitfinex’s balance sheet, which was particularly troubling both because it meant that Tether was not fully reserved, and because Devasini was a large investor in Bitfinex.\n\nAmong the more recent claims against Tether are that its reserves are partially backed by billions of dollars in Chinese commercial paper, as reported by Bloomberg (and denied by Tether), and that it lent money to other crypto companies with Bitcoin as collateral. Additionally, the company settled a lawsuit with New York’s attorney general “over allegations that they moved hundreds of millions of dollars to cover up the apparent loss of $850 million of commingled client and corporate funds” for $18.5 million.\n\nCover of Bloomberg Businessweek\nDespite the heat, and the lawsuits, and the government scrutiny, Tether has proven to be Teflon, maintaining a $65.9 billion market cap, down from a high of $83 billion achieved before UST spooked the market for all but the most stable stables.\n\nTether’s legitimacy has been debated ad nauseum and is out of the scope of this essay, but it’s worth noting that despite $17 billion in net outflows, Tether currently trades at $1. For his part, Jeremy Allaire said on the Bankless podcast that he believes that Tether will be around for a long time and has useful applications, particularly in Asia.\n\nBut when the job of a stablecoin is to earn trust, any hair is an impediment. At the heart of Tether’s challenges is the fact that the company is not transparent, and doesn’t disclose where its money is held or what it holds. Particularly in a market like this one, that’s not ideal.\n\nTransparency is where Circle stands out. Largely by earning more trust, USDC is on its way toward flipping USDT as the largest stablecoin. As DeFi Surfer highlighted in Crypto’s Third Trillion Dollar Opportunity, USDC is rapidly gaining market share:\n\nCoinGecko Data Charted by DeFi Surfer\nTrust is foundational for stablecoins: people need to trust that their internet dollar will get them a fiat dollar. Trust is the main reason that USDC is stealing market share from USDT, and one of the reasons that fiat-backed stablecoins remain much larger than algorithmic or crypto-backed stablecoins.\n\nMaintaining trust isn’t easy, though. It requires resisting temptation.\n\nHow Do Stablecoin Issuers Generate Revenue?\nLet’s take a quick but very important aside to understand how stablecoin issuers generate revenue. It’s weird to think of a currency, digital or otherwise, as a business, but understanding how it works will help you understand the motivations of different stablecoin issuers.\n\nVery simply put, the revenue formula for stablecoin issuers is $ in Reserves \\* Yield on $’s in Reserves.\n\nSo a useful framing to keep in mind as you read this piece is that there are two main ways that a stablecoin issuer can increase its revenue:\n\nGrow Reserves\n\nGenerate a Higher Yield on Reserves\n\nGrowing reserves is straightforward. As a stablecoin issuer issues more stablecoins, it trades $1 from the customer for 1 dollar-denominated stablecoin that it creates. It puts that $1 in its reserve. If someone redeems, they give the $1 back in exchange for the 1 stablecoin. So you can think of this growth lever like most companies: increase usage of the product.\n\nGenerating a higher yield on reserves is a little more complicated, and this is where stablecoin issuers can get into trouble. Stablecoin issuers need to generate some yield, that’s how the business works.\n\nKeeping every dollar in USD when redemptions are paid out in USD guarantees that there will always be a dollar available (assuming the banks you’re depositing with don’t go out of business), but bank accounts generate next to nothing.\n\nThe next-least-risky is short-duration US Treasury bonds, like 1-month and 3-Month T-Bills. The yield on 3-Month T-Bills is commonly referred to as the “risk-free rate.” Something very bad would need to happen to not be able to get your dollar back from the US Treasury.\n\nToday, 3-Month T-Bills offer a rate of 2.29%, meaning $1 billion in reserves invested in 3-Month T-Bills would generate $22.9 million per year in risk-free\\* interest income. (\\*Nothing is really risk-free.) Not bad!\n\nBut for some, having $1 billion just sitting there earning the risk-free rate is too boring. There’s so much more money to be made! For them, there are a bunch of different ways to generate higher yields on reserves, including:\n\nA fractional reserve model (like banks) means that you can lend each dollar more than once.\n\nInvesting reserves in riskier assets should generate higher yields on each dollar. Riskier assets might include longer duration Treasuries (like a 10-Year Treasury Bond), commercial paper, Chinese commercial paper, Yankee Deposits, DeFi, crypto-lending, and even equity or fund investments.\n\nPushing 25% of the reserves into even slightly riskier debt that generates something like 4% would mean an additional $4.275 million in interest income per year versus putting it all in 3-Month T-Bills, juicing revenue 19% by doing something that, in most market environments, should be totally fine.\n\nBut each basis point of additional yield comes with additional risk. The history of financial markets is full of examples of things that should have been safe in most market environments blowing up spectacularly. CeFi lenders like Voyager and Celsius were riskier than they seemed. Companies default on debt. Countries can default on their debts. During the Global Financial Crisis, the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck”, almost destroying the economy as investors withdrew $172 billion from money market accounts before the Fed stepped in.\n\nOver a long enough time horizon, increasing yields on reserves is antithetical to growing $ in reserves, because increasing yields decreases the chance that there will be a dollar there when people want to redeem, which ultimately decreases trust. For pegged stablecoins, trust is paramount. Whoever engenders the most trust among investors through their actions and transparency will win through growth.\n\nCircle has opted to grow reserves, rather than chase higher yields, in order to grow revenue.\n\nWin trust. Grow $ in reserves. Win more trust. Become the standard that developers and financial institutions rely on to build new tools and capabilities.\n\nBecause while the value prop that 1 USDC = $1 is crucially important, it’s just the starting point.  What makes stablecoins particularly compelling is their digital superpowers.\n\nWhy Are Stablecoins a Valuable Primitive?\nCryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH haven’t caught on as a medium of exchange outside of the crypto economy. The main reason is that they’re so volatile.\n\nWhat consumer wants to spend 1 ETH on rent and watch the price rocket up 10% the next day? What business wants to receive 1 ETH for services rendered and watch the price fall 10% the next day?\n\nThe most obvious benefit of stablecoins relative to more volatile tokens is just that: their stability. If both parties in a transaction can reasonably assume that 1 USDC = $1, they can transact like they would in dollars.\n\nThe bigger question is why stablecoins are useful relative to good ol’ fashioned dollars, or the bank-intermediated versions thereof. To answer that, we need to start with what I think is the most fundamental thing to understand about crypto in general: crypto gives physical properties to digital assets.\n\nCash has some advantages over bank accounts. If you have $1,000,000 stashed under your mattress, and you need to pay a business associate $100,000, you can simply pull out a few stacks and pay them directly, right now, for free. Often, if you tried to make the same payment through a bank, you might have to pay wire fees (especially if you want the transaction to settle on the same day) or even need to physically go to the bank to sign papers. If your associate is in another country, that’s probably another fee, and it’s going to take a while. Oh, it’s Saturday? You’ll need to try again on Monday, between 9am - 4pm.\n\nPaper cash has some obvious drawbacks, too. It doesn’t earn anything. Keeping all of that money under your mattress might make for an uncomfortable night’s sleep. If your house catches on fire, the money disappears. A robber can break into your house and steal it. More practically, to give $100,000 to your business associate, one of you is going to need to travel to the other. If you live nearby, that’s a minor headache; if you live in different countries, it becomes very impractical. And then, once you do exchange the money, you need to manually enter the transaction in your accounting software of choice.\n\nAnyway, you know the limitations of cash. There are reasons we don’t use it much anymore. Sending wires online, or even Venmos for smaller sums, is so much more convenient than cash that people put up with the slowness, fees, and lack of control that comes with online banking.\n\nBut… there’s gotta be a better way, right?\n\nThat’s the basic thing stablecoins are trying to achieve: cash with digital superpowers.\n\nIn a great thread on the importance of stablecoins, ChainLinkGod spelled out those superpowers.\n\nTwitter avatar for @ChainLinkGod\nChainLinkGod.eth\n@ChainLinkGod\n1/ Stablecoins are the Trojan Horse that will bring smart contracts to the masses\n\nWhy?\n\nThey’re the probably the first and only real-world use-case of crypto today that is fully sustainable and rapidly scaling\n\nA 🧵 on #Stablecoins and how they’ll take over the global economy\nImage\nMay 23rd 2022\n\n269 Retweets1,050 Likes\nHe tweeted that stablecoins are a “superior form of fiat” that are:\n\nProgrammable\n\nPermissionless\n\nBorderless\n\nLow-cost\n\nFast settlement\n\nInteroperable\n\nHighly liquid\n\nLet’s unpack each.\n\nProgrammable means that stablecoins can be coded to do certain things automatically. In a simple example, if I get my paycheck in stablecoins, a smart contract can automatically release my payment directly every two weeks (or every day, or every hour, given the low transaction costs) with just my wallet address. Some can even be sent to a DeFi lending protocol where I can earn yield, or swapped into ETH, automatically.\n\nPermissionless means that I can send you a stablecoin, right now, with just your wallet address, without needing to go through a bank, just like cash, but digital. It also means that developers can build applications that use stablecoins without speaking to the issuer.\n\nBorderless means that there’s no distinction between sending money to someone in your same country and another country – there’s no such thing as an “international wire” here. I saw the power of this firsthand when a few of Not Boring Capital’s LPs asked to fund their commitments via USDC because the process was so much simpler, cheaper, and faster than trying to fund internationally through their bank.\n\nLow-cost is pretty self-explanatory, but also means that there aren’t any bank fees for holding or sending money. Today, on Ethereum, gas fees can be prohibitive for smaller transactions, but that gas fee remains constant whether you’re sending $1 or $1 million. But already, sending USDC on an Ethereum Layer 2 like Polygon – which is what Stripe does (more below) – or a cheaper L1 like Solana brings the cost down to next-to-nothing. Over time, sending money should be as cheap as sending an email.\n\nFast settlement means that as I send money to someone, or receive money from someone, that money is actually in my account and not in their account. If you’ve ever had pending transactions in your bank account, or received a payment that’s on the way but not yet in your account, you’ve felt slow settlement. For a good time, check out this Quora on how bank settlement works. Fast settlement, combined with features like programmability and interoperability, mean that money should be able to zip around faster than in the traditional system (at least in the US today; countries like India have better systems, and faster settlement should be coming to the US via FedNow.)\n\nInteroperable means that stablecoins can plug into any of the other web3 protocols and applications, and even into many traditional companies, seamlessly. Interoperability makes stablecoins behave a bit like platforms, which we’ll touch on shortly.\n\nHighly liquid means that there’s enough stablecoin out there that they can easily be bought or sold. There’s over $54.8 billion of USDC alone in the system.\n\nObviously, there are risks as well.\n\nFor example, what happens when you send your money to the wrong address? Unless there’s someone really nice on the other end, that money is gone. What happens if you forget your seed phrase and can’t access your wallet? Money’s gone in that case, too. Wallet gets hacked? Gone. And there’s no bank on the other end to make you whole.\n\nThese are real risks for any self-custodied digital asset, and before buying, holding, or sending digital assets, you need to make sure that you’re using best practices like hot and cold wallets, sending test transactions, and never, ever clicking on a Metamask support link. It should get safer over time, as both Circle and the broader developer ecosystem are building products and infrastructure to mitigate the risks and protect users.\n\nBack to the benefits, this being crypto, all of those pieces can combine and compose to create novel benefits. Or rather, entrepreneurs can combine those features to create novel apps that would not have been possible before.\n\nTo date, the largest use case for stablecoins has been crypto trading. Funds and individual traders use stablecoins for a bunch of reasons – instant settlement, complex trades without currency risk (needing to make a directional bet on the price of Bitcoin), access to foreign exchange, taking on leverage, and accessing the DeFi markets, where you can’t just plug in US Dollars. Plus, if you want to trade on a decentralized exchanged (“DEX”) like Uniswap, you can’t transact in USD; if you want to sell ETH, for example, for an asset that doesn’t have currency risk against the US Dollar, you’ll trade it for USDC or another dollar-denominated stablecoin.\n\nUSDC is used for all of those things, but Circle’s real ambition is to be a platform on top of which developers build novel, previously-impossible financial products.\n\nThis is probably a good place to pause for a second and give a little bit of Circle’s history. It wasn’t always a stablecoin company. Its story is a familiar one for platform and API-first companies (see: Amazon AWS & Lithic): build a consumer product, realize the infrastructure doesn’t work, build your own infrastructure, and productize the infrastructure.\n\nCircle’s History: From Bitcoin to USDC\nCircle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire started the company in the early days of crypto, back in 2013, to help consumers “more easily convert, store, send, and receive digital currencies such as bitcoin.”\n\nAllaire was already a tech veteran at the time, having founded the eponymous Allaire Corp. and online video services provider Brightcove before founding Circle.\n\nJeremy Allaire, Circle\nFun fact: after going down the internet rabbit hole in 1990, when it was largely a tool for the government and academia, Jeremy realized that there was an opportunity to commercialize it. In 1992, he wrote a proposal for the commercialization of the internet and submitted it to the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Science & Technology… Al Gore. When Al Gore famously mentioned to Wolf Blitzer that he “took the initiative in creating the internet,” he did so in part based on Jeremy’s proposal.\n\nAnyway, with Jeremy’s background and the early excitement around bitcoin, he had no trouble raising money. Per PitchBook:\n\n2013: $9 million Series A from Breyer Capital, Accel, and General Catalyst\n\n2014: $17 million Series B led by the same investors with Pantera Capital\n\n2015: $50 million Series C led by Goldman Sachs & IDG Capital at a $250M valuation\n\n2016: $60 million Series D led by IDG Capital at a $480 million valuation\n\n2018: $110 million Series E led by Bitmain at a $3 billion valuation\n\nAmazingly, it raised all $246 million before landing on, and announcing, what would become its killer app: USDC, which it announced in May of 2018.\n\nJoao Reginatto, Circle’s VP Product, told me that when he joined the company seven years ago, he signed up to be the product manager for Circle’s consumer app, Circle Pay.\n\nThe plan was to build a product for people who wanted to transfer funds over blockchain rails with an app that abstracted away the complexity and provided a familiar experience. People are most familiar and comfortable with fiat currency, so they enabled Dollar, Euro, and Pound balances and transfers, on Bitcoin’s rails. In the background, they handled all of the liquidity and treasury operations, like converting dollars into BTC and back.\n\nBut by 2016, it was getting too slow to operate on Bitcoin, which was built to be P2P money, not to support apps on top. Then, they tried ETH and it wasn’t quite right, either. Then, they thought about launching their own settlement token. No go. Finally, they realized that what they needed was fiat currencies that run on blockchains.\n\nThey looked into Tether, but didn’t think they could build on top of it, so the team realized they’d need to create their own stablecoin. They brought it to the leadership team, who said, “OK! Go build a stablecoin if you don’t have the rails you need, and then we can come back to Circle Pay.”\n\n“Then,” Joao laughed, “We never came back.”\n\nIn September 2018, Circle and Coinbase launched USDC, and in October, they announced that they’d co-founded the Centre Consortium, “a joint venture aimed at establishing a standard for fiat on the internet and providing a governance framework and network for the global, mainstream adoption of fiat stablecoins.” USDC began circulation in October 2018, and by the first day of 2019, there was $288 million USDC in circulation. To this day, Centre is jointly-owned by Circle and Coinbase and helps set the direction for the protocol, while Circle is the issuer of USDC.\n\nCircle’s history building consumer financial products on the blockchain informed the way that they built USDC.\n\nFirst, it set the tone for Circle’s regulatory and compliance stance from day one.\n\nAs Jeremy explained, one of the earliest questions he and his investors asked about operating financial services on the blockchain was, “Is this even legal?” Some first-time entrepreneurs might just let it rip, but Jeremy had already sold companies and built up a reputation, and he wanted to do it right.\n\nHe hired one of the country’s top regulatory advisory firms out of his own pocket, and they found that while there wasn’t a lot of precedent or guidance, there was some. In March 2013, the US Department of Treasury issued a six-page memo titled, “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies.” Essentially, it said that if you act as an exchanger of money from the banking system to digital currency, you must register as a money transmitter, have Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorism policies in place, and get all the appropriate licenses.\n\nJeremy put it more bluntly: “The reality was, if you wanted to build a business at the intersection of the traditional and new systems, you had to be regulated or go to jail.” But instead of turning him off, Jeremy was actually intrigued by, and drawn to, a space where so much policy work needed to be done:\n\nSomething new that changes society and introduces risk needs new policy – autonomous vehicles, AI, spacecraft, genetics. Regulated spaces are hard because the implications for society are more pronounced. I wanted to work on something hard, and something that was going to be hard globally.\n\nSo from day one, they “walked in through the front door.” The company’s first non-co-founder hire was its General Counsel / Chief Compliance Officer. Starting in late 2013, Jeremy said, “We got every license we possibly could, and became the most licensed and regulated firm in crypto at the time.” Circle was the first company to receive New York’s BitLicense, and helped shape it by providing feedback. According to Joao, after Circle got the first BitLicense, other people would come to the NYC office for meetings and ask to see it, as if it were a relic.\n\nEarly on, and to this day, “doing it in a regulated way brought on a lot of ‘boo hiss’ from the crypto community, but if you want this to be mainstream, you have to do it,” said Jeremy. From the beginning, Circle’s position has been to work with regulators to be part of the dialogue, educate, and “preserve what’s important about crypto: openness, interoperability, programmability, and its inherently global nature.”\n\nSecond, starting by attempting to create consumer products on blockchain rails meant that when Circle created USDC, they built it as a platform on which other developers could build beautiful and frictionless user experiences.\n\nFrom the beginning of USDC’s development, Joao “wanted to build with APIs in mind, and with scalability from the developer’s point of view.” They needed APIs to handle issuance and redemption from the beginning. As soon as the team got USDC to market in 2018, most of it pivoted immediately towards building out APIs and developer tools and documentation.\n\nCircle was preparing for a world in which USDC powered everyday applications in web3, maybe even that it would build itself again, but it was focused on building infrastructure.\n\nIn The Myth of the Infrastructure Phase, USV’s Dani Grant and Nick Grossman described the apps-infrastructure cycle: “First, apps inspire infrastructure. Then that infrastructure enables new apps.”\n\nThe Myth of the Infrastructure Phase, Dani Grant and Nick Grossman, USV\nA developer tries to build an app and realizes that it’s impossible or overly difficult to do with the current infrastructure, so other developers go out and build the infrastructure that would make those apps work, which opens up new possibilities for new apps, which have their own new infrastructure needs, and so on in an upward spiral. That certainly seems to apply to USDC’s development.\n\nCircle built the infrastructure, and started working with developers who were building applications to see how USDC could help. And then suddenly, DeFi Summer happened.\n\nThe explosion in DeFi’s popularity – led by protocols like Uniswap, Compound, Aave, and Maker – created an explosion in the developer ecosystem, and interest in embedding USDC in all of the new things they were creating. DeFi developers came to Circle with ideas – “We want to wrap USDC, but make it yield-bearing,” for example – and the Circle team said, “Go for it!” Since USDC is permissionless, Circle doesn’t give or refuse permission anyway, but they were psyched to see developers building new things with their primitive.\n\nUSDC adoption has driven Circle’s meteoric rise. In May 2021, with USDC’s market cap just above $20 billion, Circle announced a $440 million funding round from Fidelity, FTX, Digital Currency Group, and more. Later that year, it signed an agreement with SPAC Concord Acquisition Corp. to take it public at $4 billion. This February, it announced that the SPAC valuation more than doubled to $9 billion, and in April, it announced a $400 million round led by BlackRock and Fidelity, as USDC’s market cap grew to  $51 billion. There have been no recent announcements regarding the SPAC, and it’s possible that the deal expires before it gets to market given the current market reception of both crypto and SPACs.\n\nToday, while DeFi activity has cooled off, Joao told me that USDC itself, with its scale, gravity, and strength during the crash, is as close as it’s been in its entire journey to behaving like a platform.\n\nHow are USDC and Circle a Platform?\n\nWhen I first spoke to Jeremy, he told me that from the beginning, Circle wanted to build the http or smtp for money, protocols that are open, that anyone can connect to, but that allow for some things that http and smtp don’t, namely moving value and settling transactions.\n\nThe manifestation of that vision changed as Circle iterated its way towards product-market fit, but the vision itself remained consistent through the creation of USDC.\n\n“When we launched USDC,” he explained, “The concept was that the best way to launch was as a protocol that anyone can build on top of.”\n\nCircle needed to provide the dollar liquidity and market infrastructure, regulated infrastructure that connects bank money and US Treasury bonds with entities it onboards in a compliant way. Once USDC was in circulation, the combination of tokens and the protocol became a platform that anyone could build on top of.\n\nNow, the Circle team is focused on creating better infrastructure that abstracts away a lot of the complexity for developers and users, and on expanding the suite of stablecoins it offers.\n\nIt’s weird to think of digital money as a platform, but it works.\n\nThe other day, I was on a call with Joris Delanoue, the founder of Fairmint. Today, the company lets US companies issue equity in exchange for time & effort or a cash investment. The company is web2.5 – investments on Fairmint are compliant securities and the front-end feels very web2, but in the backend, it uses USDC and smart contracts to facilitate smoother, faster, cheaper transactions.\n\n“The USDC stablecoin is absolutely key to blurring the border between on- and off-chain,” Joris explained when my ears perked up, “It’s reliable and properly backed 1:1, and it lets us deliver a 10x better experience when dealing with (crytpo-native) securities.”\n\nNear the end of the call, after we went through all of the progress they’d made on the product, he threw in as an aside: “Oh, and we’re actually looking at the European market now that Euro Coin launched.” That’s a big unlock from a simple coin.\n\nThat conversation was the first time that USDC’s role as a platform clicked, but Fairmint is just one example of the many companies, both web3 and traditional, that are building on top of USDC today. Party Round, a Not Boring Capital portfolio company, lets companies raise, and investors invest, in both USDC and fiat. When I asked CEO Jordi Hays why they use USDC, he pointed to demand from both founders and investors, and said that it just makes the experience smoother: “A company can raise money from 50 people in 50 countries as easily as they could raise from 50 angel investors in the US. Instant is big. Global is big. 24/7 is big.”\n\nEstablished companies like Visa, MoneyGram, Twitter, and Stripe are working with USDC to facilitate crypto payments, too.\n\nIn March 2021, Visa announced that it had become the first major payments network to settle transactions in USDC, writing:\n\nVisa’s standard settlement process requires partners to settle in a traditional fiat currency, which can add cost and complexity for businesses built with digital currencies. The ability to settle in USDC can ultimately help [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) and other crypto native companies evaluate fundamentally new business models without the need for traditional fiat in their treasury and settlement workflows.\n\nVisa’s partnership is an important stamp of approval for USDC – Visa is a $427 billion market cap global leader in moving money – and is still in the early innings, focused on settling money within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nStripe pushed the ball a bit further, towards non-crypto-native platforms and users. In April 2022, Stripe announced that it was introducing global crypto payouts, starting with Twitter creators, with USDC on top of Polygon. Stripe highlighted that crypto payouts will let platforms “quickly pay out to their users in even more countries, and improve their services for those who prefer crypto over traditional fiat payment methods.”\n\nWorking with established companies, which are often more conservative than their web3 counterparts, has pushed Circle to answer more sophisticated questions. Speaking with people at Stripe, it’s clear that they’re not just going to do crypto to do crypto; they need to understand how it works down to the most minute detail. Joao said that web2 and traditional payments companies are a lot more focused on questions like, “Which chain should we use? Or should we use multiple? If we use multiple, how exactly does bridging work and is it secure?”\n\nThey also have more demanding requirements. “For USDC to be an actual platform for millions of developers,” Joao highlighted, “We need to build out infrastructure that other financial platforms have.”\n\nCircle plans to build out a lot of new infrastructure on-chain, and is particularly focused on how to raise the level of abstraction for developers. For example, Stripe is starting with Polygon, but plans to expand to more blockchains later this year:\n\nStripe\nThat infrastructure should make it so easy to use USDC cross-chain that which chain a developer or user wants to use should be an implementation detail. As Joao put it, “If there’s a merchant who wants to receive USDC on Solana, but the payer is on Ethereum, we want to make that happen easily. We’ll need to abstract away things like bridges, exchanges, gas costs, and more to make it happen.”\n\nIt might also build out specific SDKs that make it easy for web2 and web3 companies to build products around USDC. “The web2 opportunity is huge.”\n\nThink about the apps you use every day. Twitter, which consumes \\~99.99% of my app time, is already connected to USDC via Stripe. Many of the most popular apps – like Uber and Airbnb – have wallets built-in, even though you might not think of them like that.\n\nUber (left) and Airbnb (Right)\nCurrently, those companies need to register in multiple jurisdictions and set up different banks based on where they operate. Airbnb, for example, is an e-money company in Europe and needs to hold and maintain a license to hold customer balances. Building with something like a Circle wallet SDK, they might be able to let users self-custody, top up their accounts, and spend frictionlessly with much less headache for both Uber & Airbnb, and for users.\n\nThose are pretty straightforward examples, and there are a lot of similar opportunities to build financial products for directly or indirectly financial web2 apps, but the bigger opportunity will likely arise from all of the new companies that couldn’t have been built before.\n\nAs Circle builds out tools and infrastructure to traditional companies’ more exacting standards, developers in web3 will get access to those same capabilities, without ever needing to talk to a human at Circle.  The infrastructure Circle creates, and USDC itself, are open, interoperable, and permissionless.\n\nThere are some obvious challenges that need to be solved to get to a place where stablecoin rails replace the 20th century Fortran-based infrastructure that the financial system is built on top of today. On– and off- ramps, from fiat to crypto and back, need to get smoother. There need to be more options for custody between a Coinbase account and full self-custody with an 18-word seed phrase, like Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and social recovery. Options for refundable transactions will need to be made available. Circle can build some of this into its APIs and SDKs, and the developer ecosystem as a whole will keep developing new solutions to the known challenges.\n\nThere will need to be more regional stablecoins, too, representing the Pound, Yen, and hundreds of other fiat currencies used around the world in order for stablecoins’ global potential to be realized. There, too, Circle expects to build in certain cases and partner in others.\n\nCircle plans to keep creating new, regulated, fully-backed stablecoins and better, smoother infrastructure, creating a platform on top of which anyone with an internet connection and some skills can build. It can give those tools to developers for free while still building a massive, profitable business because of the way it makes money. It even has a venture arm, Circle Ventures, that invests in products in the ecosystem that leverage USDC in order to accelerate development in the space.\n\nIn fact, Circle is incentivized to make it as cheap, safe, and easy as possible for anyone to build on top of USDC, EUROC, and future stablecoins because Circle makes more money when more of its stablecoins are in circulation.\n\nCircle has iterated its way into one of the best business models on the internet.\n\nWhat is Circle’s Competitive Advantage?\nHere’s the beauty of Circle’s business model: it charges customers nothing, which increases its scale, and makes more money as it gets bigger by investing its reserves in safe assets.\n\nIn many ways, Circle is an example of what Chris Burniske calls Protocols as Minimally Extractive Coordinators. In it, he writes: “The less extractive a protocol is in coordinating exchange, the more that form of exchange will happen.”\n\nWhen dollars are converted into bits and bytes, friction and transaction costs go down. Since Circle doesn’t charge developers or users to use USDC – since it’s minimally extractive – more exchange should happen in USDC. As more exchange happens in USDC, and more USDC circulates, Circle holds conservative reserves to ensure that liquidity is always on hand to redeem USDC for a dollar at par. The portion of those reserves held in US Treasuries, I would assume, generate income for Circle, without needing to charge users or developers.\n\nThat’s why, in addition to what I believe are the team’s genuine ambitions to create a better, faster, cheaper, and more open financial system, a stablecoin company can pour resources into building out infrastructure that it gives away for free. It’s building a platform business that monetizes through interest on reserves instead of fees.\n\nUSDC is building network effects that boggle the mind, and come from two sources: the platform and the money itself.\n\nThinking about USDC as a platform, it has classic network effects that are somewhere between Marketplace (2-sided) and Platform (2-sided) network effects as described in NFX’s Network Effects Manual.\n\nNFX: The Network Effects Manual\nWithout going too deep into the weeds on the differences – which come from whether supply builds for just one platform or multiple – Circle’s flywheels look like this:\n\nFirst, as more developers build on USDC, USDC gains more utility (it can be used to transact in more products), which creates more demand for circulation, which creates an incentive for more developers to build on and integrate with USDC. It becomes the de facto starting point for developers and partners looking to build with stablecoins.\n\nThe second network effect comes from the money itself. Specifically, the more USDC there is in circulation, the more utility it has. A simple way to think about this is that $1 million is worthless if you’re the only person in the world who uses dollars, but very useful if everyone uses dollars.\n\nThis is classic Metcalfe’s Law: the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants in the network.\n\nThe bigger and more widely used USDC becomes, the more valuable it is to everyone who uses it and to all of the developers who build on it. And because its platform is money and therefore it’s able to give away its infrastructure practically for free and monetize its reserves, Circle should be able to grow developer and user adoption faster than web2 platforms and APIs that need to charge users to build sustainable businesses.\n\nThis is Circle’s competitive advantage against tech challengers, but it might soon face a much larger competitor.\n\nOne of the perceived challenges to USDC is that the US government might issue a Central Bank Digital Currency (“CBDC”) in part to maintain the dollar’s position as the global reserve currency in an increasingly digital economy. China is going that route with the e-CNY. Circle believes that USDC and other commercial dollar-backed stablecoins give the US the best of both worlds: the innovation benefits of an open, competitive, capitalist ecosystem that also increases demand for USD as all USDC are redeemable 1:1 for USD. If you’ve been reading Not Boring, you know which approach I think makes the most sense, but it might not be either-or.\n\nDante Disparte, Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Global Policy, believes that CBDCs and commercial dollar-backed stablecoins can co-exist.\n\n“What we’re building for,” he told me, “is something cross-border versus domestic. USDC is internet-scale and designed for open, permissionless, more equitable economic activity on the internet. A CBDC is invariably domestic and transmits the risk to the taxpayer.” Earlier this month, Dante wrote Borderless money in a hot, flat, and crowded world to lay out his position in more detail, and last week, Circle’s VP of Policy & Regulatory Strategy Teana Baker-Taylor dropped a thread on the view that private and public digital money can co-exist:\n\nTwitter avatar for @TeanaTaylor\nTeana Baker-Taylor\n@TeanaTaylor\nRight now, at least 105 central banks, representing \\~95% of global GDP, are evaluating creating a CBDC.\n\nQuestion I receive daily:\nWhat happens to #stablecoins when #CBDC's come online?\n\nMy short answer: public & private money co-exist today.\nBut...🧵👇🏻\nJuly 14th 2022\n\n8 Retweets28 Likes\nTime will tell, but the government might be less of a competitor than it is a complement.\n\nIn fact, Circle’s skill and experience working with governments is its second source of competitive advantage.\n\nIn addition to the advantages that Circle gets with scale, it has a regulatory and compliance advantage over new entrants and existing competitors. Over the past nine years, it has poured resources and countless hours into building out best-in-class internal compliance, getting all of the necessary licenses to operate in the US and abroad, and working with policymakers to craft sensible legislation. It’s had to convince conservative companies like BNY Mellon, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, not to mention top insurance companies and auditing firms, to work with it. In doing so, and operating to a high bar, it’s established strong relationships with key players.\n\nIf it seemed fairly certain that regulators would crack down on risky stablecoins, like Luna’s UST, before the recent meltdown, it’s all but guaranteed now. It’s clear that stablecoins will be regulated, and that stablecoin issuers will be held to the highest standards. Circle is working to make sure that, as Jeremy described it, “policies don’t put the genie back in the bottle.”\n\nIn a more regulated space, Circle’s trust will be an even bigger competitive advantage, as Dante explained:\n\nFor some, the feature in stablecoins was opacity, lack of regulation, frictionlessness — all interesting during good times, but when you’re running for the exit and looking for redemption is when trust matters most. You can’t buy insurance when your house is on fire. We’ve been doing things that will increasingly become the global regulatory standard well before it was a requirement.\n\nHe believes that we’ll see thoughtful, pro-innovation regulation from the US Government and that regulators will see the importance of “same risk, same rules” in creating “more optionality in payment systems rather than disrupting and disintermediating banks.”\n\nWhile the government can’t regulate math, it can and will regulate the behaviors of firms issuing stablecoins. And when it does, Circle has a near-decade-long headstart.\n\nIn order to compete with Circle, new fiat-backed stablecoin issuers will not only need to overcome its strong network effects, scale economies, and cash generation machine, they’ll need to do so while building up the compliance infrastructure, and trust, that Circle has.\n\nAre the barriers to entry high? Yes. But Jeremy pointed out that there were high barriers to entry in competing with Facebook, too, before Instagram and TikTok came along. Ultimately, the company seems willing to support and partner with anyone in the space who can contribute to building a new, internet-native financial system.\n\nWhat Would a New Financial System Built on Circle’s Rails Look like?\nIf you were to design a new financial system today, from scratch, with all of the existing technologies, how would you design it?\n\nThere’s another benefit of stablecoins, specifically fully-reserved stablecoins like USDC and DAI, that we haven’t touched upon but that’s worth highlighting: separating the payment function of money from the lending function of money.\n\nToday, both governments and banks can create money. Governments create a certain amount, people and businesses put their money in bank accounts, and then banks can lend out multiples of that money based on reserve requirements. That’s called “fractional reserve banking,” and the amount that banks can lend out relative to deposits is dictated by the Liquidity Coverage Ratio laid out in Basel III. (If you want to have a wild time, you can read all 75 pages here.)\n\nThere are issues with a fractional reserve banking system, as seen during the Global Financial Crisis, but Basel III goes a long way towards fixing them. As with anything when I write about web3, I don’t think the benefit is in taking down big evil corporations for the sake of it, banks included. I worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great people. Instead, to me, one of the main benefits is who the value can accrue to when you remove those middlemen.\n\nWhen you deposit your money at a bank, they lend it out over and over, and earn interest for doing so. I haven’t checked my account recently, but the interest is typically comically low (and they charge me a $5/mo “maintenance fee”!). The four biggest banks in the US alone – JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo – generated a combined $173 billion in net interest income in 2021.\n\nSource: Company Filings\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income a bank earns from lending and the interest it pays out to depositors. Presumably, those numbers will go up this year in a rising interest rate environment; depositors don’t care enough to move banks for a few extra basis points.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with banks making money. It’s their job, and a lot of smart people have built out a lot of sophisticated infrastructure to do it well. But it is an opportunity for challengers. In the bull case for DeFi, that $173 billion represents the value available to be either made by lenders or saved by borrowers. The math is rough – on one side, there are a lot more banks in the world, and on the other, fully reserved means fewer loans for each dollar, among other factors – but directionally correct as a starting point.\n\nThe difference is that in this system, the net interest income should go to the people who own the dollars, not to banks. With stablecoins, anyone can plug into a DeFi lending protocol and lend money to generate returns higher than 0.01%, or whatever they’d earn in their savings account.\n\nFor this opportunity to even sniff the TradFi interest income opportunity, a lot needs to happen. For one, DeFi will need to begin to touch real world assets (RWA) like cars, small businesses, and yes, mortgages. There are a lot of challenges there, but there are also a lot of smart people working to solve them.\n\nThe technological building blocks are starting to come into place, but the biggest headwind won’t be the technology, it will be the law. City Councils will need to recognize NFT Titles. The Federal government will need to come out with clear regulation. Battles will be fought in the court. “This happened with the internet, too,” Jeremy pointed out, before the internet became the fabric of everything that it is today.\n\nIn interviews, Jeremy applauds the US government’s approach to regulating the internet. When it was first taking off, government officials talked about making people and businesses apply to be able to create a website, but luckily, they chose to let it remain open. The internet we know and love today owes a debt of gratitude to those early regulatory decisions. Today, stablecoin regulation is at the same inflection point internet regulation was at two decades ago.\n\nOpen or closed?\n\nGovernment-run (Central Bank Digital Currency or “CBDC”) or commercial?\n\nAs more people begin to use stablecoins to transact and borrow and lend and get paid and do all sorts of things online, as consumers get more comfortable with the technology, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll want to go back to the way things were.\n\nThey’ll want to tap into liquid global pools of capital to borrow money to buy a house at a lower rate than they can get from a bank, instantly and permissionlessly, and they’ll want to be able to directly earn more from their money than they’re able to get from their bank account. This will likely eventually be true in the US, and it will likely be useful to people in other countries, where mortgages are harder to come by and more expensive, far sooner.\n\nAs leading DeFi protocols continue to demonstrate their sturdiness in volatile markets, and as the interfaces improve, consumers and institutions alike will get more comfortable with this online financial system. That will take time, and a lot needs to be built and worked out.\n\nBut all of the current problems are solvable problems, particularly when the goal isn’t “total decentralization,” but rather “more widespread access on smoother rails.” Some people will go full DeFi, others will work with lenders who build some pieces on USDC rails. As with Circle itself, there will be a trade-off: some centralization in exchange for a range of improvements over the current system.\n\nAs always, the most impactful innovations will likely be the ones we haven’t even dreamed up. “There are huge categories that haven’t been created or even thought of,” Jeremy said:\n\nWe have programmable money, dollars as a native data type, a protocol you can use to interact, and computation environments (smart contracts) to write code that interacts with all of that. We have transparent, open, risk-managed credit facilities on the internet. We’re getting close to the point where USDC and other stables can transact with sub-second finality for a penny or two.\n\nWhat can you do with all of that? I don’t know! We’re in the very early stages of discovering what people can build.\n\nOne thing is clear: to reach mass adoption, we’ll need better interfaces. An app that Jeremy thinks we’ll see, and will need to see for widespread adoption, is a superapp like Tencent’s WeChat that combines Decentralized Identity, Decentralized Social, messaging, stablecoins, payments, the ability to interact with tokenized IP, one view of the NFTs that have utility for you (and links to the places those NFTs have utility via tokengated commerce), and more. “But in order for that product to exist,” he said, “the things that provide those services need to exist.”\n\nUSDC is just one piece of infrastructure. For Circle to achieve its mission – to raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value - there will need to be advances in commerce that uses NFTs, entitlements, reputation, identity, scalable zero-knowledge technology, and more. Jeremy readily admits that the current model where people can see your transaction history is not going to work.\n\nBut he’s optimistic that we’ll get to a place where USDC is baked into a new financial and internet system that was built in and for the internet age. I agree.\n\nThere’s a popular narrative among web3 skeptics that we don’t need crypto because banks and fintechs work just fine. Why would you need to send money abroad with stablecoins when something like Wise exists? I’m a big fan of, and investor in, fintech companies. Moving money has gotten much better in the last decade.\n\nBut the skeptics’ belief is essentially that we’ve reached the end of the road when it comes to financial innovation – that the FORTRAN and COBOL-based rails work just fine, and that it’s not worth trying to build new rails on technology developed in the past decade.\n\nThat is insane to me, and ignores the history of both financial and technological innovation. Of course the financial system will be refactored – whether it takes a few years or a few decades – and it seems as if USDC will be a big part of that.\n\nAt the same time, I don’t think that stablecoins will replace banks or fintechs. Sometimes, they’ll co-exist. Increasingly, as is already happening, fintechs will build smoother, faster, cheaper, more global products on USDC rails, and provide the necessary guardrails, compliance, interfaces, and all sorts of other things that fintechs do best.\n\nAnd it won’t just be fintechs. As money and banking become embedded in more of the products we use every day, and new categories of products are created with new technologies, I expect that USDC will be a core piece of more and more companies’ tech stacks. That would mean more USDC in circulation, larger USDC reserves, and more interest income for Circle, without needing to push out the risk curve.\n\nTaking the trust-first approach, and building a platform, isn’t the fastest way to get rich. But it’s the safest, and it’s the only way to ensure that USDC lives up to its creators’ vision of raising global prosperity, a world in which Circle’s technology powers a modern, more fair financial system.", "timestamp": 1658539114, "digest": "m2gamT1c0znW6y3fcMKPnnweyNeMcNWLx6iNDVek95A", "contributor": "0x54664c16c3f5D0BC33bf914bC82dA9A2275f0EA2"}

Token 争夺市场》\n\n撰文：汤圆\n\n目前，在以太坊的 Layer2（L2）扩容解决方案中，采用 Rollup 技术的方案已经成为主流，并以不同的共识机制形成了已经落地的 L2 网络，主流网络代表 Optimism、Arbitrum、ZkSync 和 StarkNet。\n\n随着网络建成后应用的迁移，L2 网络开始陷入加密资产锁仓的争夺战中。\n\n数据网站 L2Beat 显示，截至 7 月 20 日，整个 L2 网络中锁仓的加密资产价值（TVL）由高到低的网络分别为 Arbitrum > Optimism > ZkSync > StarkNet。\n\nStarkNet 在落后的局面下开始效仿其他 L2 网络，将原生 Token 的发行提上了日程，要知道，激励在区块链世界是最好的引流手段。7 月 13 日，区块链扩容技术服务商 StarkWare 连发三篇博客，介绍其 Layer2 扩容网络 StarkNet 的原生 Token，包括经济治理模型、应用场景、发行数量及分配情况等。\n\n更早前的 4 月，Optimism 发行了原生 Token OP，并于 5 月 30 日正式上线二级市场。发行 OP 后的 Optimism 在 TVL 上开始凸显优势。\n\n尚未发行 Token 的 Rollup 系 L2 网络仅剩 Arbitrum 和 ZkSync，但从近期和过去的生态动态看，Token 发行也是迟早的事。\n\nZkSync 早在官方的用户文档中表态将会发行 Token，但未透露具体的发行时间并未透露。打开 ZkSync 用户文档页面，第一条就是关于「是否会有 Token」的提问，官方答案为「Yes」。\n\nArbitrum 没有明确表示将会发行 Token， 但它在 4 月 20 日发布了名为「The Arbitrum Odyssey」的生态探索活动，鼓励用户使用链上项目获得 NFT 奖励。不少用户猜测，参与活动、获得 NFT 奖励很有可能 Arbitrum 为之后发行 Token 设置的「用户领取资格」门槛。\n\n的确，使用链上应用形成的交互痕迹往往会成为用户获得 Token 空投的资格线。本期 DeFi 蜂窝将梳理 Rullup 系的四大 L2 网络（Optimism、Arbitrum、ZkSync 和 StarkNet）的链上生态情况。\n\nOptimistic Rollup 系 L2 网络的 TVL 更高\n\n既能保证区块链网络安全、又能提高网络吞吐量的 Rollup 技术，正在成为以太坊 Layer2 (L2) 扩容解决方案的主流技术。基于该技术形成的解决方案又因为共识算法的不同形成了 Optimistic Rollup 和 ZK Rollup 两大流派，且这两种解决方案都有了已经落地的 L2 网络。\n\n目前，Optimistic Rollup 的 L2 代表网络是 Optimism 和 Arbitrum；ZK Rollup 方案的 L2 落地网络的主要选手是 StarkNet 和 zkSync。\n\n根据 L2Beat 显示，截至 7 月 20 日，整个 L2 网络中锁仓的加密资产价值（TVL）为 43.6 亿美元，其中 Arbitrum 链上 TVL 为 21.5 亿美元，市场份额占比为 54%，排名第一；次之的是 Optimism，链上 TVL 为 7.6 亿美元；ZkSync 链上 TVL 仅为 6100 万美元；StarkNet 更少，链上 TVL 目前只有 70 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HQAHEKtmyjAEmgXH3S5MO.png?height=582&width=882)\n\nL2 网络 TVL 及市场份额数据\n\n可以看出，ZK Rollup 系的 zkSync 和 StarkNet，在 TVL、市场份额方面都远不如 Optimistic Rollup 系的 Optimism 和 Arbitrum。\n\n这主要是因为 Optimism 和 Arbitrum 的主网具有先发优势。Arbitrum 主网早在去年 8 月就正式上线，Optimism 主网于去年 7 月上线。而 ZK Rollup 系的 ZkSync 网络 1.0 版本虽在去年 7 月份上线，但由于底层技术原因，使用场景仅限于支付，直到今年 2 月公布的 zkSync 2.0 才兼容以太坊虚拟机（EVM），适合开发者使用；而 StarkNet 主网还一直处于公开测试阶段，并未正式上线。\n\nZK Rollup 系的网络落地要稍慢于另一派系，这主要是因为基于「零知识证明算法」的 ZK Rollup 技术方案较为复杂，落地需要时间。更重要的是，该系列的 L2 网络与 EVM 的兼容方面一直难有突破，直到 zkSync 2.0 版本出现才有了新转机，声称能够做到 99% 兼容。L2 网络与 EVM 的兼容直接关系到应用开发者的时间和经济成本，而没有应用的区块链网络很难吸引用户及资产。\n\n相反，Optimistic Rollup 系的 Arbitrum 能够做到完全兼容 EVM，支持以太坊链上的去中心化应用程序（DApp）直接迁移，目前，Uniswap、Curve、Aave、1inch 等以太坊的头部 DeFi 应用都在该网络上集成。Optimism 也在去年 11 月完成了与 EVM 完全兼容的升级。\n\nOptimism 先发代币\n\n在 TVL 上排名前两位的 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 网络，在生态布局上各具特色，发展路线也各不相同，前者更注重用户体验，后者则在发行了原生代币后实现了 TVL 的增长。\n\n说起来，Optimism 主网上线时间要早 Arbitrum 一个月。但去年 7 月，该网络上线时还没有做到 100% 兼 EVM，不能实现以太坊链上的 DApp 一键迁移，链上生态发展被后来者 Arbitrum 赶超。\n\n去年 11 月，Optimism 部署的 OVM 虚拟机 2.0 版本与 EVM 实现了完全等效，还能简化开发者的开发过程，降低费用，该网络的链上生态这才正式「发芽」。\n\n但是在早期，Optimism 链上应用主要围绕合成资产协议 Synthetix 来衍生新产品，由于这类产品多为复杂的期权、合约等 DeFi 金融衍生品，对于普通交易用户来说不易操作，更合适专业交易员使用。因此，该链上应用未能吸引大量用户和资金。\n\n直到今年 4 月 27 日，Optimism 公布了原生代币 OP 的发行方案后，用户的注意力才被吸引而来，它也是基于 Rollup 技术框架下的第一个发行代币的 L2 网络。\n\nOP 发行总量约为 42.9 亿个，总供应量将以每年 2% 的速度膨胀，主要用于社区治理、投票权和项目激励。总量 19% 的 OP 将空投给用户，其中首轮给社区空投了 5%，另外 14% 将在未来分配。\n\nOP 在空投后迅速上线二级市场，形成了交易价格，最高冲至 2 美元。有数据显示，OP 的最低空投数量为 409.42 个，按照高点价格，OP 最低空投价值约为 800 美元。早期用户的财富效应迅速吸引了市场注意，外部用户开始参与其生态，希望能在下波 OP 空投中被选中。\n\n在完成首轮空投后的 6 月 9 日，Optimism 拿出了 2.31 亿 OP 创建了激励基金，旨在资助 OP 生态系统中的建设者和项目，通过项目的 TVL、日交易量等指标决定 OP 的激励数量。\n\nToken 激励计划成功将用户和项目引入 Optimism 生态。据 Optimism 浏览器数据显示，6 月 2 日，也就是创建激励基金消息的一周前，该链上的日交易数最高冲至 48.7 万笔，日增地址数为 3.9 万。截至 7 月 20 日，该网络的链上地址数共有 121 万。\n\n代表应用\n\nOptimism Bridge——Optimism 官方跨链桥，支持将以太坊、Polygon、BSC 等 L1 公链以及 L2 网络 Arbitrum 上的资产跨链至 Optimism。\n\nLayerswap—— 加密资产从中心化交易所（CEX）直接提取至 L2 网络的工具，由加密支付基础服务商 Bransfer 开发。\n\nSynthetix（SNX）生态 —— 它原是建立在以太坊上的合成资产发行及交易应用，用户可通过超额抵押治理通证 SNX 生成各类合成资产。\n\n2021 年 9 月，Synthetix 宣布将应用从以太坊主网迁移至 Optimism 网络中，它成为第一个支持该 L2 网络的以太坊头部应用。其中 sUSD、sETH、sBTC、sLINK 等合成资产已经成为以太坊和 Optimism 网络上的主流资产。\n\nSynthetix 基于这些合成资产在 Optimism 网络上搭建了多个应用场景，包括合成资产综合交易平台 Kwenta、期权交易平台 Lyra、一站式期权投资平台 Polynomial、资产管理平台 dHEDGE、衍生品交易平台 Thales 等。\n\nZipSwap（ZIP）——Optimism 网络原生的去中心化交易应用（DEX），它基于 Uniswap v2 版本的代码构建，希望能为 Optimism 用户提供一个低费用的资产兑换场所。\n\nQuixotic——Optimism 原生的最大的 NFT 交易平台。\n\nArbitrum 死磕用户体验\n\nOP 的发行确实为 Optimism 生态带来了资金流量，但该网络的 TVL 仍然逊于仅比它晚一个月诞生的 Arbitrum，这又是为何？\n\nArbitrum 由 Offchain Labs 团队开发，尽管没有发行 Token，但同样注重激励。今年 4 月 20 日，官方公布了名为「The Arbitrum Odyssey」生态项目探索活动计划，该活动的主要目的是以 NFT 来激励用户与生态应用交互，让用户通过执行链上任务来了解和体验链上 DApp 的使用。\n\n活动为期 8 周，鼓励用户交互的应用覆盖了跨链桥、DeFi 和 NFT、游戏等多种场景，用户可以体验每期列出的应用，并完成相关任务，获得官方提供的 NFT。有不少用户猜测，NFT 很有可能会是 Arbitrum 发行代币后的空投资格凭证。\n\n6 月 22 日，The Arbitrum Odyssey 发起了首期活动，成功吸引了流量。根据 Arbiscan 浏览器显示，6 月 27 日，该链上日交易次数为 28.7 万笔，新增地址数为 5.6 万。用户的激增一度导致 Arbitrum 链上出现了严重拥堵，Gas 费升高。\n\n据 L2fees 数据，6 月 29 日，在 Arbitrum 网络上，每笔交易的平均 Gas 费用最高时飙至 9 美元以上，高于同期以太坊主网的 Gas 费两倍，参与用户的怨声沸腾。随后，Arbitrum 官方宣布暂停了活动。\n\n在提升用户体验层面上，Arbitrum 甚至开发了新链。7 月 12 日，该网络宣布构建了新链「Arbitrum Nova」, 目前已在以太坊主网运行，开发人员可在该链上部署相关应用程序。\n\n如此一来，Arbitrum 就变成了双链生态 ——Arbitrum One 和 Arbitrum Nova，前者是现有的主网，后者基于 AnyTrust 技术搭建，专为游戏、社交应用程序和对成本更敏感的用例而设计。\n\n之所以推出 Arbitrum Nova 链，是因为主网 Arbitrum One 因为底层共识算法的原因存在数据异议期，直接结果是用户将 Token 提回至以太坊网络时需要 7 天的等待期，影响用户体验的同时，对高吞吐量要求的应用场景也不够友好。\n\nArbitrum Nova 适合对成本敏感、有高交易量预期的应用场景，比如游戏和社交应用程序，而 Arbitrum One 将继续覆盖 DeFi 和 NFT 项目。\n\n代表应用\n\nHop Protocol 跨链桥 —— 主要支持加密资产在 L2 网络和 L1 网络之间的转移。\n\nArbitrum bridge——Arbitrum 官方跨链桥，支持以太坊资产跨链至 Arbitrum 网络，需要注意，资产从 L2 返回 L1 需要 7 天等待期。\n\nGMX—— 建立在 Arbitrum 链上的去中心化永续合约交易应用。\n\nTreasure DAO——Arbitrum 上的元宇宙和 NFT 基础层平台，融合了 NFT、DeFi 和 GameFi 应用。\n\nStargate—— 基于 LayerZero 协议开发的跨链应用，主要专注于原生资产跨链。\n\nZkSync 注重改进网络性能\n\n对于 Rollup 技术，以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin 多次在公开场合表示，ZK Rollup 是 L2 的终极之选，但由于其底层技术比较复杂，落地还需很长时间。\n\n基于 ZK Rollup 技术的 L2 网络中，StarkNet 和 zkSync 是主要代表，尽管在开发进度、生态数据表现上，二者都落后于 Optimistic Rollup 技术派的 L2，但由于能实现即时到账，依旧被外界看好。尤其是能够兼容 EVM 的 zkSync 2.0 的上线，开发进度已经超出了业内预期。\n\nzkSync 网络由 Matter Labs 团队搭建，其所有产品都开源，更偏向于社区化运营。Matter Labs 甚至多次表示出「自己被替代掉也无所谓」，目的只在推动以太坊社区发展。在发展路线上，该团队一直在致力于改进网络，提升性能。\n\nzkSync1.0 版本于 2020 年 6 月上线，主要聚焦于支付。由于不兼容 EVM，网络的可用性受到限制，能支持的应用场景非常有限。但由于转账费用低，到账即时，在支付场景上展现了优越性。\n\n今年 2 月，zkSync 2.0 版本的公共测试网上线，实现了 EVM 兼容，大概率会成为首个利用 ZK Rollup 方案并兼容 EVM 的区块链网络。zkSync2.0 支持开发人员使用以太坊原生编程语言 Solidity 在网络上部署 DApp，以太坊主网上现有的 DeFi 应用也可以集成至 zkSync2.0 网络上，享受 L2 网络带来的高效和低费优势。\n\n不过，zkSync2.0 的正式主网一直没有上线，有用户猜测，其主网上线很可能会和发行 Token 同时。当然，实际情况还需要等待官方消息。\n\n代表应用\n\n去中心化交易应用 ZigZag—— 采用订单簿模型的 DEX，试图成为中心化交易所（CEX）在链上的替代方案。\n\n跨链桥 Orbiter Finance—— 应用于 L2 网络，支持 zkSync、Arbitrum、Optimism 等 L2 网络间的资产跨链转移，也支持 L2 和 L1 网络间的资产互转。\n\nSyncSwap——zkSync 网络上原生的 DEX，目前还在测试中。\n\nStarkNet 将发行 Token\n\nStarkNet 由 StarkWare 公司搭建，它通过产品化的思路为 L2 解决扩容问题。\n\nStarkWare 公司创建于 2018 年，有一套完整的 L2 系统解决方案，在为以太坊扩容方面，它产出了 StarkNet（L2 网络）和 StarkEx（扩容引擎）两个落地产品。\n\nStarkEx 是一套可扩容的引擎技术，专门为以太坊 DApp 应用提供服务，本质上是一个连接 L1 与 L2 的数据处理器。该技术已经服务了不少知名的 DApp，包括去中心化永续合约交易应用 dYdX、去中心化交易应用 DeversiFi、NFT 生态系统 Immutable X 等。\n\nStarkNet 是一个通用的 L2 网络，测试网已于 2021 年 11 月上线，支持开发者进行应用部署。由于 StarkNet 还未兼容 EVM，因此，它一直没有获得以太坊头部应用的迁移，生态一直不瘟不火。\n\n如此状态下，StarkNet 决定发行 Token。\n\n7 月 13 日，StarkWare 连续发布 3 篇博客，介绍了 StarkNet 的原生代币，包括 Token 的经济治理模型、应用场景、发行数量及分配情况等，并表示 StarkNet 网络已经铸造了 100 亿枚代币，开始分配给 StarkNet 生态的贡献者及相关投资人。\n\n按照计划，StarkNet 的代币在今年 9 月以 ERC-20 标准在以太坊上流通，并在未来作为 StarkNet 网络 Gas 费的唯一支付手段。目前，StarkNet 网络 Gas 费以 ETH 结算。\n\n代表应用\n\n跨链桥 StarkGate—— 官方跨链桥，支持 L1 资产存入 StarkNet 网络中。\n\n一站式交易应用 JediSwap——StarkNet 上的自动做市商（AMM）机制的去中心化交易应用。\n\nStarkswap——StarkNet 上原生的 AMM 式 DEX。\n\n永续合约应用 ZKX——Starknet 上第一个去中心化金融衍生品应用，今年 7 月 18 日获得了 450 万美元的种子轮融资。\n\nZklend—— 去中心化借贷应用，今年 3 月完成了 500 万美元种子轮融资。\n\n来源链接", "timestamp": 1658539385, "digest": "chsM7Sj7IHsmV54kHkHuFc7vvSgiIbWqiXmgOUh_5ik", "contributor": "0xa9E79b67303334C7b24f2CCcAC3B4635183F6c29"}

"加密世界已然浮现多起，伴随着这个行业的熊熊轮回，也伴随着混乱的生机。项目的“兴衰”持续进化、生长。\n\n上一天的大牛市中，再一次是我们到了Layer1、Berana、街头的大价值。城市的价值发展迅速，年轻人迅速发展成熟，各种高速增长的同时应用，在链上也发现了基础市场的价值。\n\n时过这些日子，历经数月的洗礼，第一层中的大多数项目都表现出第一层的情况，然而，在过去的一段时间里，却一直过往的环境中，仍然拥有相当强的白日牛市），结合“每一轮的轮回、项目都将诞生于上一轮高亮的城市”的历史，此时开发阶段我们更应该把时间投射到更早的时候尚早的全新Layer1们。\n\n业内人士看来，“熊市级，牛市级”的目前来看，综合一级市场动态来看，新一代Layer1即将成为新机构的聚焦点，Aptos、Sui等明星项目都即将完成完成数亿美元等级的融资。\n\n为了帮助大家清楚地捕捉到Layer1O赛场的最新发展趋势，每日星球从近半年内走入大众视野且尚未发币的新兴Layer1入选中榜10家较具代表性的项目，项目组等，我们真正的应用情况、亮点、最新进展未来手机对Layer1进行\n\n提前说明是，但只是某个组中需要出现的项目均基于融资情况、始创背景、市场热度等因素筛选而出，保证项目最终能够以较早的阶段完成项目，因此无法如期顺利完成发展，并成功打开市场，因此不组合投资建议。\n\n**Aptos： 最强势的新生代 Layer1**\n\n2019 年，Facebook 联合圈内与其他机构共同改名了大声大片（最近公布了天秤座监管的启动区块，以方便阅读各个方面的项目统一使用天秤座）。尽管如此，天秤座最终压力落了个胎腹中，但该死的中心其实就职于 Libra 去开发者却继承了项目的一些开发成果（比如移动开发者以另一种方式去换取）是的全新 Layer1 项目。\n\n目前，已公开于零售设备设施的Layer1、Liera等设施，其中Aptos是从量级、发展、匹配程度来看可以说一半领先。\n\nAptos 于今年 2 月 2 日，彼时，曾任 Libra 的开发者和余名成立了 Aptos Lab，并宣布将根据 Libra 的一些现有技术重新开发网络，具体来说，Aptos仍将建立在库基础上，使用 Move 代码编程语言和 Move 的开发环境，并且将采用之后的 Diem-BFT 达成共识。不过，与付出代价的 Libra 不同，的愿景则将聚焦于提高第一层的安全性和可扩展性，打造可以为人们提供服装的基础设施网络。\n\n3 月 1 日投投，Aptos 曾举办过 2 美元的融资策略，2 美元的融资策略，Katie1 领着 Multicoin Capital、三箭资本、FTX Ventures 和 Coinbase Ventures 等机构举办；同月下旬，Apt再次完成该轮的具体信息投向未来实验室，但未来机构包括确定，并且合作伙伴可以与 Binance 合作，并可以与 Binance 建立开发、代码审查和黑客马拉松等方面的基础设施建设。\n\n目前，一款手机的第二个注册空投测试网的第二次空投测试网已经运行良好的运行测试和测试网测试完成了测试，并测试了500个代币的具体情况，每天的测试周期已用于测试周期测试。写过《我和Aptos测试的节点聊聊，发现还难熬的网络炒作》（https://www.odaily.news/post/5180351），其他的读者可以看看。\n\n普通用户，通过 Mar 等终端钱包，建议前往 Apto 市场的 AptoF 项目包括 Apto 的域名化交易所域名服务、Liquidswap、NFT 等。\n\n**隋：20亿美元的新晋独角兽**\n\n日前，由项目团队发起亿亿美元开发团队的Libra项目开发团队正在筹划的项目中，我的十亿美元实验室正在寻求投资20亿美元，以千亿美元将融资 2 亿亿美元承诺提供至少 1.4 美元的资金。Mysten Labs 正是 Sui 的开发团队。\n\n早在去年 11 月，Mysten Labs 就曾完成 3600 万美元 A 轮融资，该轮融资由 a16z 领投，Coinbase Ventures、NFX、Slow Ventures、Scribble Ventures、Samsung NEXT、Lux Capital 等参投。\n\n与 Apto 类似，Sui 语言必然继承了 Libra 的 Move 开发，但 Sui 却在原版本（Core Move）上做了改进（参见：https://sui.io/learn/sui-move-diffs） ，推出专门针对于网络的服务器，新的移动、性和移动版本的基础上对机制地址等进行了更好的交易，从而提高了网络性能的提高水平，提高了网络安全性能。 。\n\n提升性能，通过对交易类型进行分类，隋会针对具有一贯关系的交易的核心问题的核心机制，兑现交易的并行化处理（交易并行化、交易并行化），从而来从始终关系到隋会的核心交易机制网络提升性能。据 Figment Capital 合伙人 Trace 介绍\n\n（参见：https://twitter.com/tracecrypto1/status/1546498909513650177），在 MacBook Pro 上运行 Sui 节点的早期数据显示能力超过 12 万笔 Token 交易。\n\n5 月末，Mysten Lab 发布了 Sui 的经济币模型及激励相关内容，SUI 的总量为 100 枚，将在主网启动时流通，代币剩余的 UI 将在供应商未来为或在包括激励活动分配。用例参与方面，SUI 的用途 PoS 质押、支付费、支持 Sui 经济体系以及参与链上投票等。\n\n本周，为了测试目标的 Chrome 钱包，另外 Mysten Labs 已经发布了用于月宣ui 的官方发布了 Sui 官方发布的“Sui 8 朋友钱包测试网”\n\n**Linera：Libra Gang 背景的另一条 Layer1**\n\n继 Aptos、Sui 之后，Linera 是第三条已公开宣布完成融资的 Libra 背景 Layer1。\n\n6 日，Linera 宣布完成 600 美元轮融资，本轮融资的投投还是 a16z，包括 Cygni Capital、Kima Venture 和 Tribe Capital 等，所筹资金用于将众投机构和投资开发者募集资金等其他员工来共同制造协议。\n\n与另一种源项目相比，Linera 发表的一篇最新的预告片的首期报道，可用于发布的最新消息，可发布的最新消息.com/@linera/introducing-linera-bdb809735552）。\n\n简单来说，Linera 希望制造一个可以使用 web2 应用那样轻松扩展的低延迟区块链，像其 Linera 聚焦在了创始人兼首席执行官 Mathieu Baudet 时的重点研究 Libra 协议和 Zef 之时上通过这个协议，将整个运营商的运营商和运营商运营商之间的运营商快速运营。\n\nLinera 的愿景要推广这种方法，让它很实用，让大多数基础帐户的操作能够在几秒内快速得到确认。\n\n**歌唱：Cosmos 生态的稳定币新野望**\n\n尚比较测试阶段，但可以已经然吸引了市场的广泛关注。\n\n来看一看，Canto 是从一条基于 Cosmos SDK 上不同市场的其他 Layer1 网络，会胡椒粉与其他几个 Layer1 网络，Canto 自带一些 DeFi 组件，例如分叉于 Compound 的分叉功能于 Solidly 的 DEX、以及一个叫作注的全新稳定。\n\n从组合性上来看，这三个 DeFi 组件之间是相相成的关系。注意，市场发行并不直接走薄荷机制，需要通过制定超额生成正常的 ETH、ATOM、CANTO 等资产，辅助其有效锚定需要通过最高市场交易联盟的稳定市场规则，以及 DEX 的联合委员会来共同维护，注意将作为联盟上层（甚至整个 Cosmos 的服务于领导及市场）。\n\nUST暴雷，去市场上出现了一定程度的生态在生态上的表现，NOTE在一定程度上对生态环境进行了集中展示，NOTE一定是在整个市场的视线。如果 UST 也可以直接采用正常的方式复制，就可以像 Layer1 一样正常使用了一而快速打开欢迎。\n\n \n **齿轮：Polkadot 生态最受期待的智能合约链**\n\nCosmos生态有Canto，Polkadot生态也期待值非常高的Layer1 Gear。\n\n去年 12 月，基于 Polkadot 的智能合约投Gear 宣布完成 1200 万美元融资，本轮融资由 Blockchange 领投，Three Arrows Capital、Lemniscap、Distributed Global、Polkadot 创始人 Gavin Wood 等参参。\n\nGear 是支持 WebAssembly 的一条（SM）的合约，待成功拍下高级平行链插槽并接入后，开发者将能够在 5 分钟内以最简单、最有效的方式将其 Dapps 部署到 Gear，即进入波卡大生态内。\n\n就技术特点而言，从包括但不支持以下几种不同特性的开发者的语言，例如 Rust、C++ 等，将大大降低一系列、C++ 等不同类型的开发者的语言。入门窗帘，为行业带来的好处二是当应用程序在浏览器中运行时，WebAssembly 的程序运行速度快，以用户的实际体验；第三点关于智能合约的沟通，耳机使用采用演员模型，这种类型的设计上是可分片的，可并行的，开发者可以在模型上进行异步编程，演示模型的允许处理效果，真正意义上的各种不同业务，基于 Gear 的不同业务逻辑 Dapps 可以高速运行。\n\n**Celestia：让Celo甘愿降级作“绿叶”的Layer1**\n\nCelestia 的前世名叫做 LazyLedger，虽然这两个名字可能都不是很复杂，但你可能对这件事有过某种印象。\n\n一个是去年 Polygon 推出通用可扩展数据可用性层 Avail 时，Celestia 的联合创始人 Mustafa Al-Bassam 曾发声讨论 Avail 的介绍几乎逐字复制了他在 2019 年写的 Celestia 介绍。\n\n二是今年 4 月，Celo 财库组织 Ocelot 文表示，计划更改其公链发展路线图，将 Layer1 架构转换为在 Celestia 之外的 Layer2 Rollup，使用 Celestia 网络实现共享性和数据有效性的方法，而不再承担验证者和共识问题的责任。\n\nCelestia的第1层，该是链上的首个“特殊区块链”。交易层进行解耦，其本身作为共识层将只承担交易层的划分和数据验证工作，具体的执行则将至其他至连接层的交易执行网络（如Celo）除外。\n\n采用链构架，可实现链结构，并实现共识“层级共识”的多层次结构来实现多个链表链的扩展性、希望和互操作性”。\n\n路线图显示计划，Celestia 于 2022 年启动测试网，并在 2023 年逐步启动激励测试网以及主网，其开发团队也已确认会用于 PoS 质押的发布。\n\n然而，因此，Celestia 在架构上因此与 Polka 的“多条链+平行链”的存在一定相似，而原本构筑的链架构路径看起来好像是那么如人意，待 Celestia 上线时可以正常运行实际观察待观察。\n\n \n **Aleo：四年磨一剑的隐私龙头**\n\n真的很详细，Aleo 团队在 2019 年开始开发并没有什么新项目，在 2019 年左右完成了它的框架项目，2800 年左右完成了 2800 年 2021 年融资，a16z 领投，Placeholder VC、Galaxy Digital、Variant Fund、Coinbase Ventures、Ethereal Ventures、Polychain Capital、Slow Ventures、Dekrypt Capital、Scalar Capital、Zero Knowledge Validator、Coinbase 前首席技术官 Balaji Srinivasan 等参投。\n\n今年2月，Aleo又完成了2亿美元的B轮融资，SoftBank、Kora Management领投，a16z继续跟投、Tiger Global、Samsung Ventures等参投。\n\nAleo 的定位是合约的隐私类型 Layer1，其核心技术是 Zexe 和 Leo 核心板块，Zexe 同意两个协议在 ZeroCash 原有的 zks 技术上进行改进，也可以加密的令牌交易，可以应用生态平台的编程语言，Leo 作为 Aleo 的编程语言，可以将 Zexe 共识协议的 zk-s 设置讨论，任何在 Aleo 平台上支持的 Dapp 都可以使用 zk-s 交易。\n\n值得一提的是，Aleo 第一季度曾游区块链游戏平台 去年这一年有 9 亿美元（亿美元）合作，将携手 Aleo 的解决方案将零知识证明带入链中。\n\n测试测试完成后，Aleo 将在主网发布阶段，其代代也将同步进入，待Aleo 测试第三代测试网已披露其将采用减半式的代币模型。\n\n**Anoma：支持任意资产自由交换的隐私网络**\n\nAnoma 是力强风投 Polychain Capital 推的隐私型 PoS 公链。\n\n去年4月，Anoma完成了首轮675万美元融资，Polychain Capital领投，Electric Capital、Coinbase Ventures、FBG Capital、CMS

"加密世界已然浮现多起，伴随着这个行业的熊熊轮回，也伴随着混乱的生机。项目的“兴衰”持续进化、生长。\n\n上一天的大牛市中，再一次是我们到了Layer1、Berana、街头的大价值。城市的价值发展迅速，年轻人迅速发展成熟，各种高速增长的同时应用，在链上也发现了基础市场的价值。\n\n时过这些日子，历经数月的洗礼，第一层中的大多数项目都表现出第一层的情况，然而，在过去的一段时间里，却一直过往的环境中，仍然拥有相当强的白日牛市），结合“每一轮的轮回、项目都将诞生于上一轮高亮的城市”的历史，此时开发阶段我们更应该把时间投射到更早的时候尚早的全新Layer1们。\n\n业内人士看来，“熊市级，牛市级”的目前来看，综合一级市场动态来看，新一代Layer1即将成为新机构的聚焦点，Aptos、Sui等明星项目都即将完成完成数亿美元等级的融资。\n\n为了帮助大家清楚地捕捉到Layer1O赛场的最新发展趋势，每日星球从近半年内走入大众视野且尚未发币的新兴Layer1入选中榜10家较具代表性的项目，项目组等，我们真正的应用情况、亮点、最新进展未来手机对Layer1进行\n\n提前说明是，但只是某个组中需要出现的项目均基于融资情况、始创背景、市场热度等因素筛选而出，保证项目最终能够以较早的阶段完成项目，因此无法如期顺利完成发展，并成功打开市场，因此不组合投资建议。\n\n**Aptos： 最强势的新生代 Layer1**\n\n2019 年，Facebook 联合圈内与其他机构共同改名了大声大片（最近公布了天秤座监管的启动区块，以方便阅读各个方面的项目统一使用天秤座）。尽管如此，天秤座最终压力落了个胎腹中，但该死的中心其实就职于 Libra 去开发者却继承了项目的一些开发成果（比如移动开发者以另一种方式去换取）是的全新 Layer1 项目。\n\n目前，已公开于零售设备设施的Layer1、Liera等设施，其中Aptos是从量级、发展、匹配程度来看可以说一半领先。\n\nAptos 于今年 2 月 2 日，彼时，曾任 Libra 的开发者和余名成立了 Aptos Lab，并宣布将根据 Libra 的一些现有技术重新开发网络，具体来说，Aptos仍将建立在库基础上，使用 Move 代码编程语言和 Move 的开发环境，并且将采用之后的 Diem-BFT 达成共识。不过，与付出代价的 Libra 不同，的愿景则将聚焦于提高第一层的安全性和可扩展性，打造可以为人们提供服装的基础设施网络。\n\n3 月 1 日投投，Aptos 曾举办过 2 美元的融资策略，2 美元的融资策略，Katie1 领着 Multicoin Capital、三箭资本、FTX Ventures 和 Coinbase Ventures 等机构举办；同月下旬，Apt再次完成该轮的具体信息投向未来实验室，但未来机构包括确定，并且合作伙伴可以与 Binance 合作，并可以与 Binance 建立开发、代码审查和黑客马拉松等方面的基础设施建设。\n\n目前，一款手机的第二个注册空投测试网的第二次空投测试网已经运行良好的运行测试和测试网测试完成了测试，并测试了500个代币的具体情况，每天的测试周期已用于测试周期测试。写过《我和Aptos测试的节点聊聊，发现还难熬的网络炒作》https://www.odaily.news/post/5180351\n\n普通用户，通过 Mar 等终端钱包，建议前往 Apto 市场的 AptoF 项目包括 Apto 的域名化交易所域名服务、Liquidswap、NFT 等。\n\n**隋：20亿美元的新晋独角兽**\n\n日前，由项目团队发起亿亿美元开发团队的Libra项目开发团队正在筹划的项目中，我的十亿美元实验室正在寻求投资20亿美元，以千亿美元将融资 2 亿亿美元承诺提供至少 1.4 美元的资金。Mysten Labs 正是 Sui 的开发团队。\n\n早在去年 11 月，Mysten Labs 就曾完成 3600 万美元 A 轮融资，该轮融资由 a16z 领投，Coinbase Ventures、NFX、Slow Ventures、Scribble Ventures、Samsung NEXT、Lux Capital 等参投。\n\n与 Apto 类似，Sui 语言必然继承了 Libra 的 Move 开发，但 Sui 却在原版本（Core Move）上做了改进（参见：https://sui.io/learn/sui-move-diffs） ，推出专门针对于网络的服务器，新的移动、性和移动版本的基础上对机制地址等进行了更好的交易，从而提高了网络性能的提高水平，提高了网络安全性能。 。\n\n提升性能，通过对交易类型进行分类，隋会针对具有一贯关系的交易的核心问题的核心机制，兑现交易的并行化处理（交易并行化、交易并行化），从而来从始终关系到隋会的核心交易机制网络提升性能。据 Figment Capital 合伙人 Trace 介绍\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tracecrypto1/status/1546498909513650177\n\nMacBook Pro 上运行 Sui 节点的早期数据显示能力超过 12 万笔 Token 交易。\n\n5 月末，Mysten Lab 发布了 Sui 的经济币模型及激励相关内容，SUI 的总量为 100 枚，将在主网启动时流通，代币剩余的 UI 将在供应商未来为或在包括激励活动分配。用例参与方面，SUI 的用途 PoS 质押、支付费、支持 Sui 经济体系以及参与链上投票等。\n\n本周，为了测试目标的 Chrome 钱包，另外 Mysten Labs 已经发布了用于月宣ui 的官方发布了 Sui 官方发布的“Sui 8 朋友钱包测试网”\n\n**Linera：Libra Gang 背景的另一条 Layer1**\n\n继 Aptos、Sui 之后，Linera 是第三条已公开宣布完成融资的 Libra 背景 Layer1。\n\n6 日，Linera 宣布完成 600 美元轮融资，本轮融资的投投还是 a16z，包括 Cygni Capital、Kima Venture 和 Tribe Capital 等，所筹资金用于将众投机构和投资开发者募集资金等其他员工来共同制造协议。\n\n与另一种源项目相比，Linera 发表的一篇最新的预告片的首期报道，可用于发布的最新消息，可发布的最新消息.com/@linera/introducing-linera-bdb809735552）。\n\n简单来说，Linera 希望制造一个可以使用 web2 应用那样轻松扩展的低延迟区块链，像其 Linera 聚焦在了创始人兼首席执行官 Mathieu Baudet 时的重点研究 Libra 协议和 Zef 之时上通过这个协议，将整个运营商的运营商和运营商运营商之间的运营商快速运营。\n\nLinera 的愿景要推广这种方法，让它很实用，让大多数基础帐户的操作能够在几秒内快速得到确认。\n\n**歌唱：Cosmos 生态的稳定币新野望**\n\n尚比较测试阶段，但可以已经然吸引了市场的广泛关注。\n\n来看一看，Canto 是从一条基于 Cosmos SDK 上不同市场的其他 Layer1 网络，会胡椒粉与其他几个 Layer1 网络，Canto 自带一些 DeFi 组件，例如分叉于 Compound 的分叉功能于 Solidly 的 DEX、以及一个叫作注的全新稳定。\n\n从组合性上来看，这三个 DeFi 组件之间是相相成的关系。注意，市场发行并不直接走薄荷机制，需要通过制定超额生成正常的 ETH、ATOM、CANTO 等资产，辅助其有效锚定需要通过最高市场交易联盟的稳定市场规则，以及 DEX 的联合委员会来共同维护，注意将作为联盟上层（甚至整个 Cosmos 的服务于领导及市场）。\n\nUST暴雷，去市场上出现了一定程度的生态在生态上的表现，NOTE在一定程度上对生态环境进行了集中展示，NOTE一定是在整个市场的视线。如果 UST 也可以直接采用正常的方式复制，就可以像 Layer1 一样正常使用了一而快速打开欢迎。\n\n**齿轮：Polkadot 生态最受期待的智能合约链**\n\nCosmos生态有Canto，Polkadot生态也期待值非常高的Layer1 Gear。\n\n去年 12 月，基于 Polkadot 的智能合约投Gear 宣布完成 1200 万美元融资，本轮融资由 Blockchange 领投，Three Arrows Capital、Lemniscap、Distributed Global、Polkadot 创始人 Gavin Wood 等参参。\n\nGear 是支持 WebAssembly 的一条（SM）的合约，待成功拍下高级平行链插槽并接入后，开发者将能够在 5 分钟内以最简单、最有效的方式将其 Dapps 部署到 Gear，即进入波卡大生态内。\n\n就技术特点而言，从包括但不支持以下几种不同特性的开发者的语言，例如 Rust、C++ 等，将大大降低一系列、C++ 等不同类型的开发者的语言。入门窗帘，为行业带来的好处二是当应用程序在浏览器中运行时，WebAssembly 的程序运行速度快，以用户的实际体验；第三点关于智能合约的沟通，耳机使用采用演员模型，这种类型的设计上是可分片的，可并行的，开发者可以在模型上进行异步编程，演示模型的允许处理效果，真正意义上的各种不同业务，基于 Gear 的不同业务逻辑 Dapps 可以高速运行。\n\n**Celestia：让Celo甘愿降级作“绿叶”的Layer1**\n\nCelestia 的前世名叫做 LazyLedger，虽然这两个名字可能都不是很复杂，但你可能对这件事有过某种印象。\n\n一个是去年 Polygon 推出通用可扩展数据可用性层 Avail 时，Celestia 的联合创始人 Mustafa Al-Bassam 曾发声讨论 Avail 的介绍几乎逐字复制了他在 2019 年写的 Celestia 介绍。\n\n二是今年 4 月，Celo 财库组织 Ocelot 文表示，计划更改其公链发展路线图，将 Layer1 架构转换为在 Celestia 之外的 Layer2 Rollup，使用 Celestia 网络实现共享性和数据有效性的方法，而不再承担验证者和共识问题的责任。\n\nCelestia的第1层，该是链上的首个“特殊区块链”。交易层进行解耦，其本身作为共识层将只承担交易层的划分和数据验证工作，具体的执行则将至其他至连接层的交易执行网络（如Celo）除外。\n\n采用链构架，可实现链结构，并实现共识“层级共识”的多层次结构来实现多个链表链的扩展性、希望和互操作性”。\n\n路线图显示计划，Celestia 于 2022 年启动测试网，并在 2023 年逐步启动激励测试网以及主网，其开发团队也已确认会用于 PoS 质押的发布。\n\n然而，因此，Celestia 在架构上因此与 Polka 的“多条链+平行链”的存在一定相似，而原本构筑的链架构路径看起来好像是那么如人意，待 Celestia 上线时可以正常运行实际观察待观察。\n\n**Aleo：四年磨一剑的隐私龙头**\n\n真的很详细，Aleo 团队在 2019 年开始开发并没有什么新项目，在 2019 年左右完成了它的框架项目，2800 年左右完成了 2800 年 2021 年融资，a16z 领投，Placeholder VC、Galaxy Digital、Variant Fund、Coinbase Ventures、Ethereal Ventures、Polychain Capital、Slow Ventures、Dekrypt Capital、Scalar Capital、Zero Knowledge Validator、Coinbase 前首席技术官 Balaji Srinivasan 等参投。\n\n今年2月，Aleo又完成了2亿美元的B轮融资，SoftBank、Kora Management领投，a16z继续跟投、Tiger Global、Samsung Ventures等参投。\n\nAleo 的定位是合约的隐私类型 Layer1，其核心技术是 Zexe 和 Leo 核心板块，Zexe 同意两个协议在 ZeroCash 原有的 zks 技术上进行改进，也可以加密的令牌交易，可以应用生态平台的编程语言，Leo 作为 Aleo 的编程语言，可以将 Zexe 共识协议的 zk-s 设置讨论，任何在 Aleo 平台上支持的 Dapp 都可以使用 zk-s 交易。\n\n值得一提的是，Aleo 第一季度曾游区块链游戏平台 去年这一年有 9 亿美元（亿美元）合作，将携手 Aleo 的解决方案将零知识证明带入链中。\n\n测试测试完成后，Aleo 将在主网发布阶段，其代代也将同步进入，待Aleo 测试第三代测试网已披露其将采用减半式的代币模型。\n\n**Anoma：支持任意资产自由交换的隐私网络**\n\nAnoma 是力强风投 Polychain Capital 推的隐私型 PoS 公链。\n\n去年4月，Anoma完成了首轮675万美元融资，Polychain Capital领投，Electric Capital、Coinbase Ventures、FBG Capital、CMS Holdings、Lemniscap、Cygni Labs、Walden Bridge Capital等参投。\n\n同年11月，Anoma再次融资2600万美元，Polychain Capital 继续领投，参投机构Fifth Era、Maven Capital、Zola Capital、Electric Capital、CMCC等。\n\nAnoma 将真正打交道的核心分别是希望物的“隐私权”，该项目还以“为系统提供服务”，并以金融界人士的名义将其交予个人隐私。\n\n“物物”，希望个人在交易中允许任何一种可指代使用的资产交换或支付工具的网络交易，任意选择资产的类别。值得一提这里的任意资产的类别。是可以任意兑换的商品、服务或任何可表示在其价值链上的任何数字、价值的东西，包括通过操作性转移到 Anoma 上的资产、以及稳定币形式的数字货币等。\n\n“隐私”则更好地理解，在 Anoma 中，并为保护隐私保护方保护用户数据，并防止隐私保护方、金额和面额知识加密，并且会利用来保证资金的转移结果。 ，Anoma 的另外一个网络资产在转移时会有一个资产池，每个资产持有一个单独的资产。这样的资产，所有参与者越过，有多个参与者，就在一个巨大的组织之间，产生巨大的影响增加了资产转移数据的隐蔽程度。\n\n**Iron Fish：隐私层成为 Web3 世界的隐私**\n\n「我在这个民族学美国在经典场景基础上，基于原语言出出的一套加密系统，这个希望项目的住所来作为通讯通讯的主题。\n\n去年 11 月，铁鱼轮宣布完成 2770 万美元 A 融资，本轮融资由 a16z 领投，Elad Gil、红杉资本（Sequoia）、Electric Capital、Dylan Field、Alan Howard、Jeff Weiner（领英执行董事长） 、MetaStable、A Capital、Divesh Makan（Iconiq）、Do Kwon（Terra）、Matt Luongo（Keep

为每个链上地址额外配备一个“感谢”（查看密钥），地址持有者可以通过该钥匙其他神圣人权限。\n\n监管机制的解决问题，通过“回应地”，Layer1 Iron Fish 机构在显示状态下将相关的信息显示在下类查看相应地址的详细信息，从而允许维护有必要的隐私保护义务（AML） 。\n\n目前，Iron Fish将继续进行第二轮激励测试网阶段，轮激励测试将持续持续，直到阶段稳定、功能完善，做好全部准备工作。\n\n将通与其他网络桥未来多层链之间的跨链互联，赋予不同的区块链实现目标，提供保护性，其最终愿景是世界的覆盖。\n\n**Monad：Jump 前任理想“热”的扩张容**\n\n4月半时被死（当时Jump一个TerraTrading研究负责人Hon E折），Jeump

NPC、一个可穿戴画廊、直播屏幕和一个射击游戏。请参阅以下活动的亮点：\n\n[https://twitter.com/polygonalmind/status/1550177033069756417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1550177033069756417%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecentraland.org%2Fblog%2Fannouncement%2Fbehind-the-scenes-with-polygonal-mind-creating-successful-experiences-in-decentraland%2F](https://twitter.com/polygonalmind/status/1550177033069756417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1550177033069756417%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecentraland.org%2Fblog%2Fannouncement%2Fbehind-the-scenes-with-polygonal-mind-creating-successful-experiences-in-decentraland%2F)\n\n随着元宇宙与主流越来越多的交集，每天都会发现新的用例、品牌和社区开始意识到 Web3 带来的潜力。像 Decentraland 这样的平台为社区发展、外展、参与和推广提供了新的、令人耳目一新的机会。但是，由于元宇宙对许多人来说仍然非常新颖且陌生，因此感兴趣的各方可能不知道该从哪里开始。这就是像 Polygonal Mind 这样的开发工作室能提供服务的地方。\n\n除了为品牌和社区创造新的机会之外，元宇宙还开辟了一个全新的职业路线，以提供使这些机会成为现实的熟练劳动力，并就什么在元宇宙中最适合提供内部人士的建议。原本为程序员和 Web3 爱好者的个人已经成为元宇宙建设者、体验开发者、可穿戴设计师、活动策划者、LAND 所有者等等。作为一家成功的工作室，Polygonal Mind 是元宇宙早期的资深人士，而现在已为好一些大品牌开发了许多绝佳体验。\n\n该工作室很乐意回答来自 Decentraland 基金会的一些问题，并与社区分享他们的故事，以及他们的行业观点和建议。一起来了解 Polygonal Mind 的元宇宙体验构建行业的幕后花絮。\n\n### Polygonal Mind 问答\n\n**DCL：当 MTN DEW x NYXL 这个项目找你时，他们是否已经知道他们想要设计和建造什么，或者你是否帮助他们构思了这种体验？如果是，你是如何想出为他们设计的体验的？**\n\n**PM：**这个项目是通过 Mountain Dew 的合作伙伴 NYXL 找到我们的，他们带着明确的愿景和目标来到我们这里，但在视觉方面完全开放。正如我们通常所做的那样，我们开始为他们创建完全不同的概念和草图，直到我们得到一个我们都认为拥有最好的用户体验但也非常适合 Mountain Dew 的品牌战略的概念。\n\nNYXL 一直是一个很好的合作伙伴，让我们能够为他们的空间提供独特而富有创意的一切。我们一起探讨了对 MtnDew 品牌和 NYSubliners 团队等中心主题的不同看法和观点。\n\n**DCL：他们什么时候联系你关于要在 Decentraland 中创建激活的事情？品牌应该提前多长时间寻找创作者？**\n\n**PM：**他们在 5 月中旬联系了我们。我们认为最好在活动安排前 3 个月联系设计/开发工作室。这将有足够的时间来准备整个战略，以确保我们能够完全符合合作伙伴的利益和期望。\n\n**DCL：最近有很多大品牌与你联系，以在虚拟世界中创建激活和体验吗？你觉得元宇宙中激活的潜力是否已经被主流完全实现了？要实现它需要什么？**\n\n**PM：**是的，多个月以来许多大品牌已经与我们进行联系，过去几个月我们的影响力有所增加。我们认为元宇宙中激活的潜力尚未完全实现，但我们确实看到了关注度和出席率的提高。我们致力于大规模采用。我们认为去中心化的元宇宙将继续存在，并且它们将在不久的将来成为常态。但底层技术有待改进；更好的加载时间、更多的集成、更动态的世界、互操作性、更多支持元宇宙的设备、更多的社交联系、增加虚拟身份感觉的改进等。除了技术之外，区块链、元宇宙和 NFT 的主要愿景需要正常化，这是我们认为只有时间才能解决的问题。\n\n**DCL：您认为使用此类活动和体验来推广品牌或社区的潜力和好处是什么？您认为它与传统的促销方式相比如何？**\n\n**PM：**元宇宙开辟了品牌及其社区之间参与的新方式。它比其他传统的广告方式更具沉浸感、吸引力和乐趣。如果我们将其与区块链相结合，我们将获得更多新的方式来与我们的观众互动而达到一个新的水平，他们不再被视为个人客户，而是作为一个整体社区，人们可以通过多种方式参与，例如投票或拥有品牌的数字产品可以为他们带来一些其它方式无法获得的好处和额外奖励。\n\n**DCL：你在 Decentraland 为品牌设计和创造什么样的体验？**\n\n**PM：**嗯，像这样的项目有很多阶段。根据客户及其对Web3/元宇宙的了解，项目在预生产阶段可能比实际生产阶段花费更多的时间。我们通常从一些咨询会议开始，在那里我们分享我们关于 Web3 和元宇宙激活的知识和专业知识，然后我们进入预生产阶段，我们为项目建立愿景和目标，确保我们与我们的合作伙伴完全一致，不仅在艺术上，而且从营销/商业的角度来看也是如此。最后我们进入生产阶段，我们不断分享我们的工作进展并在发布前讨论营销策略。\n\n**DCL：是什么让 Decentraland 的体验/激活“很棒”？成功的关键要素是什么？**\n\n**PM：**这种体验必须很有趣，并且与您在真实生活的活动中所习惯的不同。玩游戏、获得酷炫的可穿戴设备以及与其他玩家一起发现令人愉快的品牌时刻，这些都会让人们更快乐，并与品牌的价值观建立更紧密的联系。\n\n**DCL：对于希望在 Decentraland 推广和创造体验的品牌和社区，您有什么建议？**\n\n**PM：**不要专注于销售，而是要创造价值和社区。\n\n**DCL：Decentraland 在活动和激活方面为品牌和社区提供了哪些可能性？**\n\n**PM：**如今，Decentraland 是最开放和最发达的元宇宙平台之一，它可以让任何人创造几乎任何你能想象到的东西。由于它通过区块链本身去中心化，它允许我们实施几个新工具来增强用户体验。其中一些是直播、NFT、可穿戴设备和游戏开发等。\n\n**DCL：对于希望成为 Decentraland 体验设计师和创建者的其他人，你有什么建议？你需要什么样的技能？你的团队需要什么样的人？**\n\n**PM：**我们的第一条建议是在做任何事情之前先花时间在 Decentraland。从其他人正在做什么，他们如何以及为什么这样做以及人们在平台上的本地行为中学习。我们已经看到许多新设计师将大量时间投入到完全脱节的事物上，而社区可以很快看到这一点。至于技能组合，这更难回答。在这一点上，我们的工作室个人需要广泛的技能，因为我们的经验变得非常详细。我们需要 3D 艺术家、游戏开发人员、区块链开发人员、动画师、Web 开发人员等等……但如果你才刚开始，一个有程序员和艺术家的团队就足以在 Decentraland 中制作很酷的东西。\n\n**DCL：你认为这些类型的激活和促销是未来吗？你认为它们将如何随着时间的推移而变化和发展？**\n\n**PM：**是的！与常规广告相比，这些举措对用户而言更具互动性，它们还可以为你提供有关谁对你的品牌感兴趣以及感兴趣程度的直接信息！这样的事情很难预见，就在一年前，我们为 MTN DEW 制作的事件是完全无法概念化的。 Decentraland 几乎每天都在技术层面上发展，同时也在社区层面上发展。新来者带着新想法进入平台，使整个平台旋转以适应他们。实时看到变化是非常令人兴奋的。我们期望的是更丰富的体验，质量胜于数量。\n\n**DCL：Polygonal Mind 的故事是什么？你是怎么走到今天的？你最初是否打算在元宇宙中创造体验？你对你的未来有什么看法？**\n\n**PM：**Polygonal Mind 在八年前作为一个独立的游戏开发工作室开始。我们转型为一家外包工作室，为移动和 VR 行业的游戏开发者提供艺术。我们开发了许多低多边形游戏，如 Morphite，获得了 Apple Store 的艺术奖项，并参与了 Beat Saber 等大型 VR 游戏。\n\n然后，在 2018 年底，就在第二次 LAND 销售之前，我们发现了 Decentraland。我们开始涉足社区，当时社区里大多都是爱好者和程序员，所以我们认为这对我们来说是完美的匹配。作为一家独立的创意工作室，我们觉得我们有机会利用我们的艺术知识帮助建立 Decentraland 的未来。一段时间后，Momus 集体找到了我们，并聘请我们建造了 Momus 公园，这是 Decentraland 有史以来第一个加密艺术画廊，至今仍然是最大的。这在当时是一个巨大的技术挑战，我们需要多次来回才能实现它，因为我们必须与数百个 LAND 合作，这在当时几乎是不可能的。\n\n从那时起，我们一直在 Decentraland 中建造东西，并且我们慢慢地将注意力从游戏行业转移到了元宇宙。到 2020 年底，我们 80% 的收入仅来自 Decentraland 项目。从那时起，我们建立了艺术画廊、游戏、总部、活动区、可穿戴设备以及许多其它疯狂的体验，比如 MegaCube。这是额外的背景信息，至今我们构建了近 4000 个 LAND 的场景，并将我们的工作室从 4 人发展到 50 名团队成员，同时保持独立！\n\n对我们来说，未来充满希望，我们希望继续在 Decentraland 中尽可能多地创造，通过艺术作为让人们进入其中的入口。\n\n**选择您常用的频道加入与我们联系，关注Decentraland(MANA)的最新动态**\n\n**DCL基金会全球社区： \n 【[Official Website](https://decentraland.org)**】 \n 【**[Telegram](https://t.me/decentralandTG)**】 \n

《[网络空间独立宣言](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence)》 的前一年，另一部影响早期互联网政治意识形态的著作出现了：大卫·朗菲尔德（David Ronfeldt） 的 《[部落、制度、市场、网络](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)》（TIMN）。TIMN 报告由兰德（RAND）公司资助。在 “奇爱博士 (Dr. Strangelove) ” 中，兰德公司被黑化模仿为 BLAND 公司。兰德公司成立于 1948 年，是一家非营利性的研究开发智库，负责向美国军方、政府和工业界提供政策信息。因为互联网始于这个军事化的环境，我们也将从这里开始。\n\nTIMN报告创造了一个社会进化的叙事，其中人类通过四种不同的组织形式取得了进步：\n\n![（T）部落有亲属、氏族和血统的社会组织原则。(I) 机构具有等级制的社会组织原则。（M）市场具有竞争交换的社会组织原则。(N)网络具有分层协作交换的社会组织原则。这里的分层指的是无等级、无层次，或能够以多种方式进行等级划分的组织。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fccfc3b17-2054-4305-b705-bd23ec2e5598.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n当新的组织形式随时间演变时，之前的组织形式“在其活动范围内增长，即使该范围已全新定义”，其指出了市场如何增加税收支持制度国家，尽管限制了其对直接经济交换的参与。\n\n![Sam Hart, Laura Lotti, Toby Shorin, Squad Wealth, 2020](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F80498627-0fad-4e56-9afe-848f8f50a539.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n这份报告的制度偏见很明显，比如，它将进步等同于西方的自由民主，而且它对社会进化的叙述可能充其量是简化的。不过，它的论点为去中心化组织有意或无意地，从中汲取政治意识形态提供了历史背景。这在报告中对网络这一最新组织形式的识别上最为明显。\n\n这份报告对网络的定义有点开放式。网络和之前组织形式之间的一个关键区别特征是，网络被描述为**多组织**，强调距离更远的”小的、分散的、自治的” 群体间的协作。这些团体不一定共享一个独特的组织统一体。虽然网络在历史上一直存在，但新的信息技术强调合作关系，通过跨越司法管辖区对机构产生巨大影响，“促进了[企业集团](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu)和其他分布式、网络化的全球企业的增长，以及越来越多的所谓的‘虚拟公司’”，大卫·朗菲尔德表示。然而，多组织网络的主要领域既不是公共部门，也不是私营部门，至少两者仍然是传统的形态。相反，它们将改变第三个领域，即报告中称为公民社会的“自治社会部门”。按照 1995 年的规划，公民社会将包括非政府组织（NGO）、草根组织和私人志愿组织；公民社会通过多组织网络得以加强，并可能解决不平等、官僚主义和普及性等之前组织无法解决的问题。\n\n该报告呈现了一个甜美的网络政治形象：“虽然制度和市场组织形式的发展导致了对竞争优势的强调，多组织网络形式的发展可能会将重点转移到合作优势上”。这种政治表象的背后是非政府组织将在未来十年向全球输出的帝国软实力。对于那些目前在 Web3 工作的人来说，所有这些语言可能感觉很熟悉，尽管这种可疑的意识形态延续通常不会被注意到。通过揭示意识形态的衍变，我们有更大的机会去改变其路线。\n\n报告最后强调了公民社会的三个字母缩写词，即 NGO、NPO 和 PVO，当然，不包含这个在此以后出现的词：DAO。\n\n## 一个嵌合术语\n\nDAO 源于对去中心化技术特性如何改变组织运作方式的想象，去中心化技术特性包括全球数字资产、抗审查和自动化操作。最初被称为[去中心化自治公司](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i-1379644274)（DAC），更通用的术语 DAO出现于以太坊区块链社区。基于维塔利克·布特林（Vitalik Buterin）的“[DAO、DAC、DA 及其他：2014年以来不完整术语指南](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)”，DAO 可以被描述为一个资本化组织，由软件协议来指导其操作，将自动化置于其中心，而人在其边缘。例如，软件协议可以指定组织自动向其成员分配资金的条件。这导致了这样一种想法，即组织价值可以通过代码自动执行，这一影响深远的想法，可能错误地[暗示隐性知识](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)可以在软件协议中充分表达。虽然这个术语有很多假设的想法，但当 DAO 从理论变成实验时，社区很大程度上重新定义了 DAO 这个术语，以表示“不可阻挡的”或抗审查的企业。第一个 DAO，称为 [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization))，已经成为以太坊区块链社区迄今为止最大的事件之一，2016 年它在以太坊筹集了相当于超过1.5亿美元的ETH资金。然而，这个实验被证明是短暂的，因为 The DAO 在推出一个月后被黑客攻击。\n\n与 DAO 相关的更大项目在几年内不会再次获得吸引力。从那时到现在，DAO 偏离了它最初的宗旨，不再继续作为一个嵌合术语，术语及其具体应用都根据其文化背景而变化。市场上的每一次投机活动，尽管充满噪音，但都为 DAO 可以发展的方向提供了新的信号，为实践中的概念带来了描述性、技术性和文化性上的改进。虽然有些人讽刺说，一个分享午餐账单的群体可能是一个 DAO，但为了避免其过度泛化，对 DAO 的关注将仅限于以太坊区块链社区中的例子，尽管在其他[类似协同机制的社区](https://twitter.com/helveticade/status/1400946733249662978)也起到重要作用。2021 年，DAO*可*被描述为符合数字合作主义运行原则的自发组织。作为自发组织，它们是陌生人、朋友或看上去不太可能的盟友以匿名的方式聚集一起，实现共同目标的一种跨司法管辖区的方式，并由代币模型、激励措施和治理提供支持。DAO 的成员可以通过代币拥有其数字资产的代表性所有权，代币通常同时充当治理权和网络效用。\n\n尽管许多 DAO 不会接受数字合作社的标签，但可以说 DAO 将合作主义作为一种*协议*，这意味着一组不断发展的关系实践，这与传统公司结构或去中心化自治公司不同，因为 DAO 优先考虑成员所有权。合作社的标签可以通过数字化来限定，因为今天 DAO 主要是围绕数字资产进行协调。然而，随着DAO概念在实践中发展，其将[不再完全依赖数字领域](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3)。我们将看到， DAO 还引入了新的维度，这些维度超出了数字合作社在概念上所涵盖的范围。\n\n[https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396184123761303554%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgnosisguild.mirror.xyz%2Ft4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q](https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396184123761303554%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgnosisguild.mirror.xyz%2Ft4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)\n\n*//Twitter 文：\n//DAO 不是产品，它们是关于产品或项目的决策框架。\n//如果你的 DAO 成功了，你甚至不应该知道它的存在，它只是一个运营良好的社区。*\n\n去中心化技术生态系统倾向于通过其技术产品来描述一种现象。然而，正如 Furtherfield 和 DECAL 分布式艺术实验室的联合创始人露丝·卡特洛（Ruth Catlow）所指出的那样，“我们需要先构建文化，在构建结构”。虽然以下对 DAO 工具的概述在实践中提供了概念的具体描述，但重要的是要记住，DAO 最终是通过集体网络来协作的。\n\n![DAO 的新手包, 2021](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fb277c810-3d61-4766-979c-af9d8b063e7e.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在其最简单的形式中，DAO 工具被描述为群聊和银行账户。2021年，这通常以 Discord 服务器和 [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/) 的形式出现，后者是一个创建[多签帐户](https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e)的 Web3 平台。多签账户允许多个司法管辖区的匿名团体在几分钟内汇集和管理资金，这种能力远远超过[传统的联合银行账户](https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1399196774967898113)。这种“最小可行” DAO 工具在2021年上半年表现良好，其中包括 PleasrDAO 等项目。\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/pleasrdao?lang=de) 通过集体竞拍艺术家 [pplpleasr](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr) 的 NFT。鉴于数字艺术品拍卖价格的不断上涨，PleasrDAO 背后的想法很简单：一群粉丝集体使用多签帐户，可以汇集资金进行竞拍，并通过共同持有，与其他主要竞标者竞争并赢得拍卖。在赢得他们的第一个同名拍卖会后， PleasrDAO 继续收集其他作品，如爱德华·斯诺登（Edward Snowden）的支持独立媒体的慈善拍卖 NFT 作品“[Stay Free](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437)”，当时共计 220,0 ETH 或价值 540 万美元。他们多次成功的经历意味着，在作为收集者的同时，PleasrDAO 将[扩大他们的范围](https://decrypt.co/66933/why-this-dao-bought-snowden-nft)，开始孵化他们的社区项目。像PleasrDAO这样的活动最有希望通过扩大成员来挑战机构收藏家，邀请PleasrDAO收藏的作品的艺术家，比如plplpleasr，反过来成为这个团体的成员。然而，要做到这一点，至关重要的是，所有权仍然是集体的，而不是机构化的。\n\n![由 PleasrDAO 拥有的 Gnosis 安全多签名帐户，他们共同持有收藏的 NFT。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fc9904c31-747e-4b83-aee1-0a2208b1f338.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n尽管群聊和多签帐户可能足以启动 DAO 的任务，但代币往往成为拥抱数字合作社原则的下一步骤。例如，PleasrDAO 发行了 $PEEPS，这是一个内部分发的代币，代表成员在收藏品中的权益，他们正在考虑将其上市，以拆分其收藏品的所有权。类似的实验，如 [PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=de) 启用了一种代币，其中 $PARTY 代币表示群聊的成员资格、治理权限和由 DAO 管理的生产价值的共同所有权。值得注意的是，PleasrDAO 和 PartyDAO 不是扁平层级结构，因为它们都选择了一组个人来管理它们的多签帐户金库。虽然 PleasrDAO 和 PartyDAO 最初专注于短期任务，但他们都在朝着长期愿景发展，即作为收藏家、投资者和孵化器，使用代币来代表体现数字合作精神的共同所有权。代币化为未来的网络创造了机遇和挑战。\n\n### 合作社运动的新维度\n\n回到它们的起源，今天的 DAO 与 The DAO 的相似之处，主要在于它们强调开放参与和经济价值创造，而它们的文化则更多地转向了特定的利基和社会联系。在上面的例子中，有一个术语有意含糊不清：治理。今天，许多 DAO 使用轻量级的 Snapshot 平台进行治理。在 [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) 上，每个 DAO 都有一个空间来创建项目并对项目进行投票。例如，[PleasrDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/pleasrdao.eth) 和   [PartyDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/partydao.eth) 都有一个 Snapshot 空间，在这个空间上他们对集体决策进行公开投票。 Snapsho 根据一个地址持有的 DAO 特有代币的数量对投票实施权重，如 PleasrDAO 中的 $PEEPS 代币。\n\n![PleasrDAO 的 Snapshot 空间显示了关于是否买入 Dreaming at Dusk NFT 以使 Tor 项目受益的投票。 投票以396,690 $PEEPS 代币的赞成票达成通过。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Ff09da5e4-c7e9-4dd4-b736-f6a504f02606.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在加密生态系统中，[治理的话题](https://technosphere-magazine.hkw.de/p/The-Byzantine-Generalization-Problem-Subtle-Strategy-in-the-Context-of-Blockchain-Governance-8UNNcM8VShTpBGWRuob1GP)有其自身的历史，这里不进行全面阐述。特别是 [MolochDAO](https://www.molochdao.com/) 项目，它使用经典字体 Papyrus 并大量参考游戏公会，在 The DAO 被黑客攻击后重新点燃去中心化治理的火焰。MolochDAO 激发了一大批新的

[DAOstack](https://daostack.io/) 还在继续为 DAO 开发平台，[Block Science](https://block.science/) 和 [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/) 等模块化项目不断出现。这些项目提供了支持多种[治理机制](https://blog.gnosis.pm/a-brief-discussion-of-the-protocol-governing-the-dxdao-7331407a2555)的 DAO 工具。然而，如果不涵盖其较少提及的同平台合作主义的关系，DAO 的史前史也是不完整的。\n\n基于数十年的共同倡议，Trebor Scholz 创造的“平台合作主义”一词以及 Nathan Schneider 概述的 “[交予社区治理](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73)（Exit to community）” 概念，通过 Jesse Walden 的 “[所有权经济](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/)” 等文章与加密领域产生了交集。这些口号提倡由用户社区拥有、开发和管理的平台。具体来说，“交予社区治理“的概念通过明确阐述公司发展所有权的第三条途径影响了去中心化治理。\n\n![Nathan Schneider，创业公司需要一个新的选择：退出社区，2019](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fd14efc42-4c3c-4e7b-a6c9-b760a118e7c5.jpeg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n“交予社区治理”这一概念在实践中，通过一些项目不断发展，比如 [DXdao](https://twitter.com/dxdao_?lang=de)，该项目启动的目的是赋予社区所有权、治理和软件协议的价值。今天，有许多去中心化的金融软件协议通过 DAO 指导其开发，很明显，软件协议既可以退出社区，也可以[与社区一起构建](https://twitter.com/VENTURE_DAO/status/1395544596550062080)。由于 DAO 使用早期阶段的软件工具，因此它们的第一个用户和用例将涉及数字资产（如软件协议）的治理，这是有意义的。 DAO 在数字领域的主导地位或许是它们与早期合作社运动相似之处常常被忽视的一个原因。\n\n今天，国际合作社联盟（ICA）将合作社定义为“个人自愿联合的自治团体，通过共同拥有和民主控制的企业来满足共同的经济、社会和文化需求和愿望”。合作社也可以由其法律实体的结构来界定，这种结构规定合作社是由其成员而不是股东所有的公司。1844年，一个纺织协会制定了《[罗奇代尔原则](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles)》（Rochdale Principles），标志着合作社历史上的一个关键时刻。国际合作社联盟采纳了这些运作原则，这些原则仍然指导着全球的合作社：\n\n1. 自愿及开放的会员资格\n2. 成员民主控制\n3. 成员经济参与\n4. 自治和独立\n5. 教育、培训和信息\n6. 合作社之间的合作\n7. 关心社区\n\n虽然这些操作原则在过去的两个世纪中不断发展，但今天的一些 DAO 可以很容易地制定这些运行原则。自愿和开放会员资格、成员经济参与和关注社区的原则可以转化为上述 DAO 的例子。自治、独立和合作社之间的合作原则是 DAO 作为多组织网络蓬勃发展的关键，通过跨 DAO 协作加强自治社会部门的建设。\n\nDAO 可以围绕成员民主控制设定更深思熟虑的规范，合作社通常将其定义为一个成员一票。大多数 DAO 使用代币投票，即一个代币一票。DAO 的理由是代币所有权代表利益相关者，代币模型通常在经济上直接与 DAO 联系在一起，例如通过对它所拥有的软件协议收费。这使得拥有更大经济利益的 DAO 成员相应地具有更大的影响力。代币投票并不直接违背合作社原则，因为有些合作社会根据质量（如产量）来权重投票。某些情况下，这可能感觉合适，但随着一些 DAO 朝着维护基本基础设施的方向发展，这种不平等显然变得不可取。在某种程度上，这是因为并非所有的利益相关者都具有代表其利益的购买力，他们的实践知识可能被排除在治理之外。这应该通过将文化渗透更多的决策机制来解决，这种[决策机制将经济利益与治理权利脱钩](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html)。\n\n在此之前，诸如 Tornado Cash 隐私协议等项目，已经通过向之前的用户追溯分发代币来解决这个分配问题，从而使用户成为协议的利益相关者。[Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) 项目是一个生态系统服务的公共区块链项目，该项目采取了另一种方法来解决这个分配问题。他们将30%的代币预留给土地管理员、气候科学家以及再生土地管理的其他利益相关者，形成了参与网络治理的[社区 DAO](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3)。由于代币可以比传统的公司权益、成员资格或股份更容易分发，这为一种新的代币持有者公司形式创造了可能性，它可以在治理中纳入更深入的实践知识，而不增加运营交易成本。具有实践知识或[“隐性”知识](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)的利益相关者，就像 Regen Network 案例中的土地管理员一样，通过在决策中融入非正式实践，使治理受益。在这里， DAO 开始引入新的维度，这些维度超出了数字合作社概念上所涵盖的操作原则。出于这个原因，应该像重视决策机制一样，将更多的创新和重点放在识别更广泛的利益相关者参与的代币分发机制上。\n\n在线社区的代币化可能是一个长期争论的主题。代币化并不是解决 web 2.0 社交媒介困境的最佳答案，而是引入了更多的金融化关系意识。作为一颗指路星，web3 应用程序的目标是在关系中引入价值（这在历史上曾被否认），例如劳动和环境的关系而非创建新的财务关系。这种情况下，对于以创造经济价值为使命的 DAO ，代币在三个方面成为一种有用的机制：\n\n1. 启动融资\n2. 分配治理权\n3. 协调 DAO 的生态系统\n\n代币化向早期组织引入了强大的*文化*规范：从一开始就期望对其资产实行透明的共同所有权。支付分红的传统公司结构和 DAO 之间的紧张关系持续存在。因为大多数 DAO 通过一种代币来代表治理权利，在某种意义上，代币有能力将合作社原则直接嵌入高度金融化的空间。毫不夸张地说，这是一枚硬币的两个重要方面，因此，不应该忽视代币化。代币可能是解锁所有权经济的一把钥匙，但为了实现这种未来的更公平版本，我们必须现在就参与基于代币的分发、仲裁和治理来打造文化。这一点很重要，因为与合作社的份额不同，许多可当作治理权的代币可以在二级市场上出售。这使得进入组织的条件更容易，但 DAO 可以从合作社对长期主义的强调中学习，通过围绕代币授予、有限的可转让性或更多实验性机制建立更多的文化模式。\n\n就像 DAO 可以从合作社的案例研究中学习一样，在双向交换中， DAO 可以向合作社引入更多形式的去中心化治理。这是 Morshed Mannan 在「[用区块链技术培育工人合作社：殖民地项目的教训](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774)」一书中提出的例子，其中提到合作社经常面临“当实体跨越国界时的协调问题”，在其国际化进程中，“在参与性管理、相互监督和团结方面存在负面趋势”。 DAO 直接解决了合作社面临的困境，如资金、治理和跨司法管辖区的协调。将合作主义作为一种*协议*，而不是作为企业结构， DAO 可以用它们的新词鼓励一种可以超越传统界限的文化空间。\n\n## 公会时代\n\n[https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\nDAO 可能意外地接受了之前的合作社的操作原则，但它们也灵活借鉴其他类型网络文化。他们可以从大型多人在线游戏（MMOs）公会中学到很多东西。\n\n随着角色扮演电脑游戏在 20 世纪 90 年代上线，这意味着大量玩家可以共享一个游戏世界：一个具有各种目标、活动和子情节的环境。早期完整的 MMO 例子包括“领土在线（Realm Online）”、“网络创世纪（Ultima Online）”和“无尽的任务（EverQuest）”，它们催生了“魔兽世界”和“星战前夜（EVE Online）”等经典游戏。在许多例子中，玩家可以自由地在开放游戏世界叙事、情境支持和风险的大方向指导下设定自己的目标，因为这种叙事自由，玩家可以组成团队来完成单人玩家无法达到的共同目标。这些团体通常被称为公会、部落或联盟，参与者从 40 人到 1000 人不等，他们的目标包括击败难啃的敌人或制造有用的工具。\n\n为了实现这些目标，公会中出现了文化模式；有时候游戏世界开发者为公会发行的工具与他们的实际需求之间会出现不匹配。以 “星战前夜”为例，游戏世界开发者为玩家创造了一个创建公司的界面，让玩家能够分发股份。在实践中，这种分配股份的特性很少使用，因为它没有加强现有的文化模式。相反地，使用“星战前夜”的游戏浏览器和数据API，许多公会开发了自己的工具去完成特定的目标。游戏公会和 DAO 之间的相似之处可以在这里体现出来，因为当前的 DAO 浪潮倾向于使用组合工具的组合，例如将 Snapshot 投票平台连接到 Gnosis 安全的多签帐户，而不是过度预测参与者使用的平台。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\n尽管在 “星战前夜 ”中发行公司股票的特殊功能可能还未出现，但游戏公会经常会采用重新分配的经济做法。从 [Varrock](https://runescape.salmoneus.net/archived-projects-and-content/site-content/tips/world-1-trading.html) 到 [gold farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming)，MMO 市场对于去中心化金融的巨大重要性将在后面的文章中讨论，但有一种经济实践可能与 DAO 密切相关：杀龙点数（DKP）。从历史上看，龙是 MMO 中最常见的敌人，DKP 作为公会内部或跨公会的分配系统出现。\n\n由公会执行的复杂而持久的任务，如杀死一条龙，通常被称为团本，其长度从几个小时到几天不等。在团本结束时，被杀死的敌人会掉落游戏中的战利品，公会必须决定如何分配这些战利品。因为公会需要不同且互补的玩家技能，“同样的人再次合作很重要”，公会分配战利品的方式必须让成员觉得公平。随着公会的成熟，它们通常会发展出不同的战利品分配系统，例如从随机分配开始，逐渐向参与程度加权的随机分配发展，最后通过非正式的评分系统（如DKP）实现分配。DKP 是一种私人货币系统，独立于游戏世界中现有的货币，公会成员可以通过参与团本获得这些货币。公会成员可以选择在团本后用这些点数换取战利品。\n\nDKP 最初是由一个公会在1999年为“无尽的任务” 这一 MMO 设计的，[它的实践](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points)已经被许多游戏世界中的许多公会所采纳，尽管略有调整。Ed Castranova 和 Joshua Fairfield 在“[杀龙点数：白皮书概述](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)：Leftovers DKP 系统” 详细介绍了一个例子，它最大限度地增加了系统中的参与者数量，而不是绑定在一个特定的公会。正如 Castranova 和 Fairfield 所写的，“事实上，这个组织实际上是群体中最高效的分配机构。如果在（“魔兽世界”服务器） Silver Hand 上有一个应急政府，那就是Leftovers 。” Leftovers DKP 系统针对一些限制应运而生：战利品只能在战斗结束后获得，在“魔兽世界”中，不能在玩家之间转移。Leftovers DKP 系统有一个非正式任命的管理者小组：玩家通过公屏聊天辛苦地设置和维护 DKP 中战利品物品价格的数据库。当掉落战利品时，拥有 DKP 的玩家可以选择用它们购买特定的道具，所有的出价和交易都是公开的。由于是零和机制， LeftoversDKP 系统会将消耗的 DKP 点数平均分配给所有参与团本的其他公会成员。\n\nCastranova 和 Fairfield 指出，DKP 补充现有的游戏世界的货币，为有效配置社会凝聚力，“使时间尽可能（花在这些团本中得不到补偿的时间）转换成物品（在这些团本中获得个人所赢取的战利品）”(22)。特别是在 “魔兽世界” 中，因为战利品不能在玩家之间转移，所以拥有战利品本身也具有强大的信号功能，表明玩家在一段时间内确实参与了团本。这个 DKP 系统早于今天开发中的 DAO 平台的机制，如 Aragon、Colony 和 DAOstack，这些平台都提供了基于成员参与的分配声誉代币的机制，这些成员由于成功的提案、资助或活动而得到奖励：在其他游戏世界中可能被称为团本。这些声誉代币补充了 DAO 平台支持的其他经济系统，例如 DAO 特定的代币或其多签帐户库中的其他资产，通常被用作富豪 “1代币1票”模型的替代模型，是通过参与而不是购买力获得，这样，给 DAO 提供了随时间而积累的更大的投票权。DAO 还可以向 DKP 学习，DKP 作为基于参与的私人货币系统，可以用于其他数字资产，而不仅仅只能是随着时间而积累。\n\n除了有效的分配、情境声誉和信号功能，DKP 系统对 DAO 还有另一个重要意义：通常所有公会都独立于传统法院系统来解决纠纷，尽管这些纠纷涉及昂贵的利益。这与 DAO 工具高度相关，比如 Aragon 的数字司法管辖区或 [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) 的去中心化仲裁服务，旨在提供互联网本地争议解决工具。事实上，DAO 工具常常试图从技术上解决游戏公会已经在文化上改进了几十年的问题，现在可能是 DAO 和游戏公会更紧密地融合他们的实践知识的时候了。\n\n![EVE Online 中一些游戏联盟的公会列，2006](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F5504ac03-20c1-4dba-83a6-efda8d3a4077.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n游戏公会的另一个微妙的文化模式与他们的经济结构有关。正如研究员 Joshua Citarella 所指出，许多 DKP 体系类似于一种市场社会主义形式，在这种形式中，商品是公有的，但由市场分配(23)。Citarella 继续指出，尽管 DKP 系统与市场社会主义相似，而且参与其中的玩家普遍感到快乐，但这些玩家中的许多人显然不会在政治上接受市场社会主义的标签。当一个团体通过一种经济形式进行运作时，“影子经济学”可能是一个恰当的术语，它不会给自己贴上这样的标签：DAO 是合作协议，游戏公会是市场社会主义。这一趋势使得游戏公会等有趣的政治领域未得到充分开发，因为游戏公会通常不需要佩戴它们的旗帜。某种程度上，这可能更像是一个特性而不是 bug ，因为像 DAO 这样的新术语的发明而不是对标准的依赖，在一定程度上激发了他们的热情。\n\n[https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e](https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2F27d86de376ed43a38dbbc4ff6653be5c%3Fp%3Df0c53a9cefee4d80a574dc6632350b7e)\n\n尽管这可能会导致忽略它们的史前史，但 DAO 仍然保持着一种强大的模糊性，在这种模糊性中，它们迅速增长的政治野心还没有完全具备熟悉的美学表达。这可以用于几个不同的目的。例如，我们可以想象一个 DAO ，当全球气温上升超过 2 摄氏度时，它的金库就会自毁，就[像 terra0 的 NFT](https://terra0.medium.com/two-degrees-nft-5af1263bfcc)，伴随着一个闪闪发光的、谦逊的吉祥物化身。\n\n这样的 DAO 可能会吸引其他一些人参加，这些人不会被大多数气候项目为人熟知的绿色美学所吸引，DAO 还可能通过创造围绕它的新文化来扩大政治目标的参与。新事物的势头总是对某些事情有利，问题现在变成了——如何培养能够跨越意识形态分歧而打造秘密团结的 DAO。\n\n## 一个新想法诞生了\n\n![事实上，DAO 可能是上图的任何一种形态。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F482156a6-7f32-475a-b467-0e0b8c4648c7.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n虽然去中心化自治组织的全面史前史可以让我们更深入了解过去，但 DAO 的许多支持者对 DAO 对未来的影响有一个核心信念：DAO 可以通过超越现代企业的合作来超越竞争。\n\n20世纪，许多经济学家问，当由市场定价的服务在理论上更有效率时，为什么会出现公司？罗纳德·科斯 （Ronald Coase）在 《[企业的本质](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)》 一书中探讨了这个问题的答案，得出的结论是，市场产生了无法解释的交易成本。这些交易成本，可能来自于价格发现、合同谈判或采用服务，可以通过将服务保留在企业中得以降低。根据这一理论，企业的规模可能有他们不会超过的实际限制，因为最终交易成本会通过部门官僚制等发展而增加。尽管这一理论有许多批评，但 DAO 的前景可以与其相关联： DAO 渴望在扩展时变得更高效(25)。虽然在实践中，这一愿望还远未得到证实，但在某些方面， DAO 承诺通过使用技术治理协议来降低交易成本。回到上面的一个例子，像 Gnosis Safe 这样的 DAO 工具使匿名小组能够在几分钟内跨司法管辖区汇集和管理资金。建立一个传统的联合银行账户可能需要几个月的时间，某些情况下，来自不同司法管辖区的个人不可能共同管理一个银行账户。通过公共区块链的支持，DAO 可以在不增加运营交易成本的情况下，将更深入的实践知识纳入治理：期望随着规模的扩大变得“更高效”。\n\n虽然像 Gnosis Safe 这样的 DAO 工具现已实现了这一点，但总的来说，对无限可伸缩组织的承诺，仍有很长的路要走。通常，即使是 DAO 的承诺也会掩盖它们在实践中的效用。 Jaya Klara Brekke、Kate Beecroft 和 Francesca Pick 在 “[异议协议：管理在线同伴社区的差异](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full)” 中着重介绍了 Genesis DAO 的案例研究，这是一个围绕着 DAOstack 平台的集体。他们写道:\n\n> Genesis DAO 是许多 DAO 共有的独特特性的一个很好的例子，也就是说，它们包含了积极性很高的团队，这些团队围绕一组关于治理的思想而形成的，而不是将治理作为实现某些共同使命的手段。换句话说，它以工具为中心，并专注于一个主要行动：为项目分配资金。陌生人在没有时间建立一致和信任的情况下，立即开始共同做财务决定，这是很罕见的。事实上，这正是像 Genesis DAO 这样项目的承诺：该技术将绕过建立信任关系的需要，这意味着成千上万的人将能够围绕目标、采取行动，甚至作为一个团队一起花钱。\n\n就像上文提到的 “星战前夜” 玩家不使用界面去分发游戏开发者所发行的公司股票一样，我们必须重新考虑以工具为中心的开发，以及工具自动创造有用文化模式的假设。与减少信任关系需求的治理技术协议不同，DAO 可以通过迭代开发高度可组合的工具，来协调不同级别的一致性和信任。最终，DAO 追求的效率可能不是定义为一种经济功能，而是一种“更好的”的治理：一种由[无限游戏](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games)中更深入的实践知识支持的治理。\n\n## DAO 的分层\n\nDAO 不会是某些人想象的那种统一的非层次网络。相反，DAO 在不同级别的一致性和信任之间进行协调。在《[加密网络的所有权](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)》 一书中，Patrick Rawson 认为，对于 DAO 来说，为了实现有意义的工作，“将所有权分配给具有更专门目标的小队式实体，是需要解决的关键长期问题”。这些“小队式实体”是具有信任关系的小型团队，可能与上述例子中的游戏公会不同，它们与 DAO 一起执行价值一致的任务。仔细观察，高效的 DAO 开始表现更像团队网络，就像有 100 个附属合作社的 [MONDRAGON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) 公司网络，而不是从远处看起来松散协调的群体智能。受 Rawson 分析的启发，我们可以大致勾勒出 DAO 的三层：\n\n![](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fe7260512-1458-4aac-bc0a-cbca9d6d532d.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n1. **代币**：根据代币所有权排列的多组织网络\n2. **团队**：由代币所有权代表的团队、公会和小队\n3. **任务**：由代币所有权资助的任务、里程碑和突袭\n\n从这三层中，一个***分层***的网络出现了，这意味着一个组织具有以多种方式进行排列的能力。\n\n![一个例子：在 DAO 中代币，小队和任务在 DAO 的不同网络中被分配，这些都可以通过多种方式排名或分类。](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F3aedd8d4-58c2-4273-bc91-3761d7f8a995.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n在优先分配所有权的生态系统中，代币鼓励 DAO 网络由其成员管理。代币、小队和任务并不局限于单个 DAO 的准机构边界，但为了可以且能够为了有意义分布化控制网络，应该用多个 DAO 中的代币所有权来表示。一个类似于跨国公司控制网络的生态系统出现了，但重要的是，一个没有单一指挥中心的生态系统，不同信任水平之间的交易成本降低了。正如 Rawson 所写的，“只要集体内存在给定的\\[ DAO 网络\\]内自由循环，就可以再次使用已发现的解决方案。”当我们将 DAO 视为根据代币所有权协调的多组织网络时，DAO 工具的目的不仅是支持一个团队的操作，而且促进多个团队的协作。由 PrimeDAO 资助的 [DAO-to-DAO (D2D) 协作机制](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21)是沿着这些路线进行的最具前瞻性的工作，它可能最终超越传统的 B2B 产品。从潜行模式中出现了一个新的小队式实体，[Gnosis 公会](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de)团队同样强调了 DAO-to-DAO 工具，形成了一个名为 [Zodiac](http://) 的 DAO 工具包。\n\n回顾 DAO 的承诺，他们将更深入的实践知识整合到治理中的潜力，并不意味着每个项目提案中的决策必须涉及越来越多的成员；而是在一个 DAO 的网络，拥有最相关的专业知识的团队可以很容易在整个生态系统进行共享。当我们将 DAO 视为不同团队形成的星座，而不是庞然大物时，DAO 就变成了允许集体记忆自由流动的网络。\n\n## 未来的网络\n\n本文中的 TIMN RAND 报告以一个引人好奇的注解结束。它写道：\n\n> 很多关于为信息时代重新设计组织的文献都关注于生产——提高生产率，或者制造波音 777 喷气式客机之类的新产品。然而，这不是反映了一种挥之不去的工业时代心态吗？生产组织仍然是组织生态的重要组成部分。不过，我们也应该考虑“感官组织”。感官功能与生产功能有很大的不同，需要不同的组织方式，比如，更多的网络连接到办公室边界之外的世界。在未来的几年里，为各种感官组织确定合适的设计，可能会成为创新研究和发展的一个很好的元主题。\n\n这段结语呼应了20世纪媒体理论家马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）时代的流行话题，麦克卢汉强调数字媒体如何影响我们的感官神经系统。如果像 DAO 这样的主要数字网络首先在我们的神经系统上运作，这并不意味着 DAO 不会来重组、重塑和重新分配我们的物质世界。有些人仍然拒绝认真对待以下事：即合作原则、游戏公会以及如 FAO 这样组织的奇怪想象场景，呈现了一种具有合法政治相关性的新兴组织形式。我们现在必须在政治上认真对待它们，这样它们就不会只由数字鸿沟一边的人来塑造。DAO 与 [PAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee) (为美国选举候选人筹集资金的政治行动委员会) 并行时代即将到来。正如市场并没有使国家这一形态过时，而是在削弱一些运作的同时加强其他一些运作，DAO 也为自治社会部门产生的传统政治参与引入了新的形式：[网络联盟](https://1729.com/network-union/)。\n\n![Trust’s Mascot Streams 中的角色, ARB and GVN908, 2021](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Ff59011fe-b6aa-42e6-9344-daab85c5976a.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n为了提醒人们注意嵌合术语在严肃性方面的缺陷，许多人回到了它的误称：DAO 中的“A”不符合自治的含义；而另一些人，比如研究员 [Aude Launay](https://twitter.com/audelau/status/1413731529042321410)，则援引了 DAO 的政治自治精神，而不是技术自治精神。尽管 DAO 这个术语在诗意上仍然是正确的，但我们可以偶尔提出一个替代品：去中心化的化身组织。这样的组织在政治意义上可轻可重。正如台湾诗人兼数字部长 Audrey Tang 所言，“化身政治家”的时代已经到来(28)。化身政治家是代表政治平台进行代表、召集和倡导的[虚拟存在](https://www.virtual-beings-summit.com/)；当自动化增加时，化身政治家甚至可能生成自己的政治平台。一个去中心化的化身组织会意识到即将到来的虚拟时代精神：它可能看起来像[集体管理的生化电子人（赛博格）](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1345110226744184833)，如 [Lil Miquela](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Miquela)，或是由成员塑造的完整环境，如 [Trust 的移动城堡](https://trust.support/)。去中心化的化身组织将共同开发、交互操作游戏世界、引擎或虚拟吉祥物，作为其核心，共同创造其成员组织的文化。\n\n![Jay Springett , 世界运行，指南：关于创造世界和运行世界的思辨性文件](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F6fa40349-2cd0-41c2-8680-ffde9154743b.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n通过学习其史前历史，DAO 可以走向一种组织的融合理论，这意味着融合广泛的文化模式、实践和影响，同时承认其继承的政治偏见的一种理论。为了避免对治理的技术协议盲目崇拜的趋势，去中心化的化身组织必须培养玩家想要居住的引人注目的环境，认识到叙事、美学和共同的目标是他们成功的关键。巴洛写道，让互联网不仅成为交易场所，还要成为关系和思想本身的场所，这些都依赖于这些叙述的深度。就像大型多人在线游戏一样，与其说 DAO 是用于管理的技术协议，不如说是相互交织的高风险游戏世界。\n\n我们应该以大致的共识和运行世界为目标。\n\n*本文是 [@keikreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler?lang=de) 连接加密网络、web3 和游戏的 [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de)

基金、Chamas 和其他形式的 P2P 储蓄或信贷协会等，诸如此类的去中心化加密协议，将成为改写金融关系的先头兵。\n\n这些小队原型是科斯定理发挥作用的例证——即强大的内部协调能力降低了交易成本，让小型团体获得更大的产能和金融机会。\n\n这些点对点团体通常由邻居和朋友组成，其非正式的属性揭示了信任在小队中所发挥的核心作用。无论是同屋室友还是分享 Discord 群组的伙伴，小队允许社会货币和金融资本相互转换，为小型团体创造了机会和韧性，而这些都不可能靠单打独斗实现。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmT-rZoi43q0_tCYZrYRC.png?height=1172&width=2000)\n\n近期发生的一系列事件让个别机构的局限性暴露无遗，小队这种组织形式的韧性成为刚需。新冠大流行是这些社会粘合剂中最新的一个：物理上我们保持距离，情感上我们越发紧密。当疫情来袭时，首要任务是确保小队的安全，协调和决策的需求接踵而至。\n\n但如今群体凝聚力文化的出现，是城市生活中社会和经济动荡双重驱动的结果。那些在同一个屋檐下分担租金的人成了家人。被一线城市排挤的人们抱团取暖，在缺乏社会保障网的失业市场中偷生。\n\n小队既是当代社会原子化的产物，也是对原子化社会的回应。＂去北边搞块地＂的说法，标志着城市年轻居民渴望基于小队的新型农庄。立队为家是现代版的[返土归田运动](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement)——把受「全球概览」启发出现的战后公社，变为后互联网冲浪俱乐部在微博上宣扬共居、生态文化园和太阳能网络等美德。\n\n小队文化是新自由个人主义的对立面。千禧一代正在从几十年的嘲讽中毒症中恢复，重新发现彼此互生的探索性关系是什么样子。有了在「我的世界」、「DOTA 2」和「堡垒之夜」等游戏中组队的经历，年轻一代已经被注入了极其强大的小队能量。\n\n![撇开军事含义不谈，私聊群的出现，迎来了＂小队＂话语权的新时代。（译者：上图显示了“squad”在谷歌 Ngram Viewer 搜索中的上升趋势，关于Ngram Viewer，详见：https://books.google.com/ngrams/info）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B9GQjsGOo6ovhR0ElVST6.png?height=740&width=1437)\n\n不管是为了生存还玩乐而凑到一起，当下的危机催生的小队组织将充满韧性。有了跨越时空的网络空间，距离将不再成为障碍——很快，生机勃勃的文化将由那些胜似亲人的小队成员们担纲演绎。团体合作现已成为强大的默认共识，将小队置于社会、文化和经济生活的中心。借用 K-HOLE 的说法：如今人作为个体出生，不得不去寻找团体归属。\n\n## 小队理论\n\n在古代，人们聚到一起组成小队是为了挣扎求存；而如今，永远在线的群组交流则为小队文化的形成创造了条件。群聊和相应的团队工作空间，创造了共同背景和群体记忆。小队的一个必要条件是这种持续存在感：共存共现。\n\n但小队不止是一个松散的关系网络，它是一个连续体。小队形成的第二个先决条件是自我认同。它不是你或我，而是我们。这个支柱往往紧随第一个支柱。一开始小队可能只是个临时发起的 Telegram 频道，但很快人们口中的＂那个群＂就变成了小队的代名词。\n\n为了实现对自身的整体认知，小队用极强的群体规范来保持边界。去他喵的邓巴数字吧——理想的小队不超过 12 人。超过这个数量的人要真正做到一起协同怎么可能呢？对紧密协调来说，小型群组至关重要。小队可能被更大的网络环绕，使它从外面看上去大且混沌。但是对于核心成员来说，一个无形的圈子限定并保护了群体认同的空间。\n\n随着**小队 VIBE** 的增长，队内成员在社交、情感和财务方面相互依赖和资源共享的可能性也在增加。持续的社会化和不断加深的自我认同带来了相互之间的信赖，成为探索小队共同能力的基础。**小队文化**才刚刚[萌芽](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJ7yW7Y3RY)。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DZby1JkYnXxk7We1dWdxJ.png?height=450&width=640)\n\n## 小队空间\n\n这场新冠大流行翻转了在真实世界里共享空间的剧本，但我们国内的新现状，无非是线上屡见不鲜的模式在物理世界中的翻版。最初人们设想的只是一系列相互链接的文档，到头来 Web2.0 的大规模产品化把互联网变成了一系列相互连接的领地。\n\n今天的小队是数字化群落的体现，崭新的小队时代迫使我们重新思考早期社交网络的个体化逻辑。与超文本的初衷相反，互联网没有成为任由个体穿梭其间的单一万维网（WWW）。如今上网犹如踏进全球竞技场；大众社交媒体成了危机四伏的杀戮地带，没有团队的支持，任何人都无法穿行。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uuPSBgRLyCihb2ZIXQUot.png?height=1476&width=2680)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wQU1oCryRzlUw3JOnseJL.png?height=1452&width=2702)\n\n上面显示的 Twitter 亚文化只是庞大社交深网的一小部分。在这个飘渺的图景之下便是小队空间──数字微文化诞生的内在网络：私聊群、Discord、Slack、Keybase。模因（meme）在小队空间中孕育成型，破茧而出，干翻 [牛肉网](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/) 上的NPC。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5e8taRmTRdBEBk07Otu5g.png?height=497&width=2000)\n\n小队文化是小队空间的下游，而小队栖居的数字场所只会越来越先进。Discord 突然可以一起语音连线了；Keybase 现在也能使用 Git 了。[团队能力取决于工具](https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/)，不同的平台上形成了不同的思想模式。小队空间不仅指环境，它还是一个连续体和共识层。小队空间是策划惊天交易、孕育奇思妙想和涌现 meme 风潮的所在。小队成员可能时空各异，但在这个空间里，每个人的时间都是小队时间。[新建一个私聊群就能开启小队元年](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes/)。\n\n群体动态潮涨潮落无非因势利导，而小队空间就是这一切的核心。生态学把这个过程称为 \"小生境形成\"。网络上，它叫做＂小队文化＂。\n\n## 小队 VIBES\n\n在社交深网的地下洞穴里，我们选中的亲人们发展出自己的文化。小队不需要自己的微货币——图像、艺术、音乐、照片、水帖，还有烤肉，都是原生的交换媒介。小队也同样不太需要内部财务激励。相反，好玩的交换活动产生了信任、互惠和 VIBE——小队最为重视却不可言喻的群体能量。因此，小队生产的核心恰恰正是其自身的生生不息。\n\n加密模因学（memetics）的力量证明，一帮乌合之众有能力在自己晦涩的社会框架中，定义出新的价值形式。meme 制造的＂资产＂无法以传统方式估价，但却能引领文化和经济运动。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-f6kiuBBCd5liHKhmNIUc.png?height=1250&width=2000)\n\nMeme、梗图、黑话、𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼.….. 这些都是只有小队才能搞出来的东西，也是小队制品的主流。它们散发着强大的小队 VIBE，而 VIBE 能勾魂摄魄。外人想要雨露均沾——有时是为了获得社交资本，有时是为了内容的战略价值，归根结底则是因为这股能量有感染力。当私聊群再也容纳不了内心的熊熊火焰之后，一些小队便开始将其社交产品外部化。播客分明是为他们天造地设的趁手工具；快速出版将 meme 变成了白皮书，土生土长的小队幽默像洪水一般席卷了创意市场。\n\n不管是机缘巧合还是事出有因，一旦相聚，小队的创意生产就变得潜力无穷。[VIBE](https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview) 是一点就着的高爆信息弹。在制造 VIBE 的过程中，小队可能会无心插柳地创造出 [去中心化品牌](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/)、虚拟人物和连他们自己也无法掌控的匿名实体。如此这般，驾驭了 vibe 的小队，从年幼懵懂中蜕变，成为创造无尽能量的源泉。\n\n[https://otherinter.net/2020_VIBES.mp4](https://otherinter.net/2020_VIBES.mp4)\n\n## 小队生产\n\n群组认同、共享空间、vibe──这些不仅创造了社交资本，而且加强了小队的组织能力，使交易成本最小化，并带来更大的产能和韧性，这是\"[小队的天性](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)\"。然而，虽然小队可以被看作是一种＂合同关系＂，却与科斯理论中的公司不同，它们没有法律结构。相反，社会契约通过 [相互尊重和内部规范](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/the-vibes-theory-of-organisational-design-937a73f791cd) 等心照不宣的纽带来实现。\n\n但为了维持这种互助经济，小队可能得寻找方法将 vibe 转化为公众可以参与的盈利模式：客户、订阅用户、赞助商、音乐交易、收成等。小队生产从创建流程和交互界面开始，将创造性劳动转化为可由全网用户传播的内容。在这里，小队工具开始发挥作用。在 DAW、Figma 板上或在游戏大厅里产生的 vibe 被转化为文化消费品。然后就轮到发行了。年轻的艺术家们创造了在线画廊和独立厂牌，这些为人熟知的组织模式有助于小队与世界互动（和交易）。Bandcamps、Twitch 页面、DAO 都是可供小队与其信任边界之外的实体互动的公共 API。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qii-UvJ9mWQ2_sL1ikXZa.png?height=1119&width=2000)\n\n一些数字工具是公共接口，而另一些则用于内部协调。如今小队基础设施由简单的软件构件组成：Venmo，Splitwise，Cash App。这些应用帮助小队成员尽最大可能避免向朋友要钱的尴尬，从而成为促进内部协调的金融管道。尽管小队韧性是必需的素质，但社会上素来对于＂一小群人管钱＂持怀疑态度，成了朋友间经济交流的主要障碍。\n\n软件内的预算跟踪、投票和掷硬币等功能，在社会协议和技术解决方案之间提供了一个中间点。例如，要确保 Splitwise 上记录的开支数据准确，很大程度上依靠的是社会规范。而让个人采用一套可追溯的结算规则，就可以降低群体的社会摩擦和协调成本。多一些小队不假思索就能使用的重要功能，可以促进文明的进步。\n\n有些人认为新软件可以解放＂个人创作者＂。但这种想法会不可避免地导致 Uber 化的雇佣劳动者中介平台。我们要解放小队。作为一个社会，我们今天所需要的工具应当以团体为基本用户。然而很少有软件能让小队作为一个整体合作生产并共同创造财富。为了充分实现小队文化，这种情况必须改变。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QVNp86GOuttS7X-MTNf6S.png?height=996&width=1554)\n\n## 小队财富\n\n有了即插即用的新金融工具，小队具备了更好的经济和社会韧性。个人获得复利回报可能机会有限，但群组却能在风险回报曲线上游刃有余。\n\n为小队做贡献是正和游戏，作为回报，成员可以获得更多的机会，对未来的经济状况有所诉求，并得到小队的支持和保障。通过风险共担，一个斗志昂扬的小队更是可以收益倍增，这就是──通往小队财富之路。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7LwTSppT69SevxxSsmNkn.png?height=568&width=1618)\n\n强大的社会结构和正确的技术堆栈将释放新一轮自下而上的经济实验：无息 P2P 借贷、匿名贷款池、集体保险、社会化 ETF、自由职业者 DAO 联盟、轮流储蓄计划、共享收益公会、meme 风投集团、加密庞氏、防诈骗、浏览器挖矿、郊外收益农场、男孩乐队、邪典电影和主权度假基金。\n\n有一点很清楚：如何获得资金和创造资产是关键。小队现在需要的是技术基础设施，以捕获并复合共同生产的价值。\n\n虽然金钱让小队得以维持，但过早地接入金融基础设施会扼杀其活力。 小*队经济主要从非货币形式的价值中收获*。**小队财富** 是每天产出 5 个 meme ，是 e-girls 的假期，是抖音喧嚣的房间，是你的伙伴们在郊区租下的空教堂。**小队财富** 是当 Discord 弹出消息的时候，它带给你的快乐比每周 70 小时的忙碌能换来的还要多。千禧一代都想辞掉工作，跑去创办风险投资公司，而小队已经更进一步，在做其他事情了。\n\n小队对新自由主义 [零工经济 ＂就业＂](https://onezero.medium.com/the-gig-economy-is-failing-say-hello-to-the-hustle-economy-13ae3aa91954) 的承诺和准社会化个人品牌那一套看得门儿清。小队所推崇的个人自决，不是通过个人主义，而是借由集体维护和彼此关怀得以实现。小队重视创造性的表达，但荣耀归于群体更甚于创作者个人。对小队来说，自主性始终带着集体的属性。\n\n*但是，小团体能规模化吗？*小队首先是文化，而不是企业。财富最大化不是他们的主要目标——小队只想让 vibe 继续。稳定的收入本身就是一个值得称道的成就。\n\n相反，通过发明新的美学、组织形式和创意产品，小队能够实现横向拓展，成为其他人的模板。当小队的 vibe 传播时，它们就有了自己的生命。虽然这些模式的物质价值可能有限，但绝不要低估将一个自下而上的新经济模式 meme 化的意义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NYHkLynpLa9D0nPSza2kw.png?height=365&width=495)\n\n在未来的几年里，小队将和公司一样重要。随着我们社会和经济微观结构的变化，强大的 vibe 和可持续性将成为衡量成功的新标准。小队不需要扩大规模，就可以传播大团队的能量。\n\n## 小队大能量\n\n小队大能量到底有多大？小队确实是数字工具加持的一帮伙伴，但它的意义远不止于新聊天软件或在线＂社区平台＂。这是一场运动。小队的领域所包含的，是在日益复杂的世界里，一起学习和创造意义的新方式。小队是由 vibe, meme 和价值观驱动的群体，但不是无意识的蜂群；相反，小队是以自己的方式参与世界运转的原型机构。\n\n**小队是我们重新对价值做出的定义**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AVg6oXVzcSnCmwAcWvTrL.png?height=1000&width=2000)\n\n**小队是一个共享的环境，充盈富饶**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35dUthf_tVuOi_XsAYRgK.png?height=1914&width=3060)\n\n**小队效应让数字网络始料未及……**\n\n**小队是历史终点的终结者**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pv63jRq_fmDx24XrWXAZ1.png?height=1728&width=2868)\n\n**小队有益健康**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/twF-kuFpeDf0lBelPRhIG.png?height=1978&width=3104)\n\n**小队

以此为噱头，为其最具代表性的产品——“高潮”系列唇膏和腮红——推出了系列 NFT。\n\n去年夏天，NARS 与三位女性艺术家（DJ Nina Kravis、Azede Jean-Pierre 和 Sara Shakeel）合作，创作了一套非同质化代币（NFT）。\"这些作品的灵感来自于——高潮，\"NARS 的全球数字战略副总裁 Dina Fierro 说，\"它的灵感来自于概念、生理反应，当然还有产品在感官上带来的灵感\"。\n\n这些 NFT 名为 “Take Me”， “Consume Me” 和 “Captivate Me”。其中一个描绘了一个女人的嘴唇被打开，波浪从中涌出。在另一个中，一种桃红色的液体（“高潮” 系列产品的颜色）有节奏地，诱人地来回涌动。正如 NARS 在其

Crossing）中投放了七款定制设计产品。Fierro 说，在谈到新技术时，传统上，美容和时尚品牌总是 \"在对话中落伍\"，拥抱电子商务和社交媒体的速度很慢。但在元宇宙这方面则不然。\n\n\"我在行业内观察到的是，在元宇宙方面大家是绝不会屈居人后的。” Fierro 说。\n\n现在看来，整个商业世界都是如此，\"进入元宇宙的公司 \"的名单感觉比 \"没有进入元宇宙的公司 \"的名单更长。(元宇宙是一个无法定义的，庞大的数字世界概念，它可以指像 Decentraland 这样基于区块链的世界，也可以是[沃尔玛的增强现实世界](https://www.xrtoday.com/virtual-reality/walmart-targets-metaverse-to-build-future-of-retail/)。)\n\n举几个例子：苏富比拍卖行在 Decentraland 开设了一家[画廊](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/04/sothebys-opens-virtual-replica-of-its-london-galleries-in-decentraland/)。阿迪达斯与 The Bored Ape Yacht Club 合作，推出 \"Into the Metaverse \"NFT。Gucci 在 Roblox（一个用户可以制作游戏的虚拟世界，其玩家有[50%是16岁以下的孩子](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite)）创建了一个艺术装置作品。可口可乐设计了 \"[Friendship NFTs](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/01/17/5-brands-already-boldly-embracing-the-metaverse)\"，是 \"为元宇宙重新设计的\"。酒厂 19 Crimes，将增强现实技术植入产品，当你[扫描酒瓶](https://19crimes.com/pages/living-labels)时，可以看到 \"罪犯 \"在向你讲述一个故事。Balenciaga 将高级时装带入《堡垒之夜》。甚至 [SPACs](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/07/06/what-is-a-spac-your-questions-answered/)（译者注：特殊目的收购公司）也在[进入元宇宙](https://fortune.com/2022/02/04/spacs-metaverse-investing-reutrns-virtual-reality/)。这样的例子不胜枚举。\n\n但在过去的几个月里，有些事情发生了转变。\n\n\"去年，很多\\[公司\\]都是为了公关宣传而做这些事情，你做得越早，你得到的关注就越多，\"专门研究元宇宙的营销顾问 Cathy Hackl 说。\"现在，这种新鲜感已经消失了。你可能会得到短暂的流量，但没什么实质的收益。公司真正关注的是长期发展。\" Hackl 说，公司不再仅仅是涉足元宇宙，而是在 \"审视最全面的元宇宙战略。\"\n\n例如，耐克[提交](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/nike-is-quietly-preparing-for-the-metaverse-.html)了大量与元宇宙相关的商标申请。这家运动鞋制造商，还发布了虚拟材料设计师等与元宇宙有关的职位空缺，成立了一个数字产品创作小组，并收购了 RTFKT（一家加密可穿戴设备工作室）。当微软宣布将斥资 700 亿美元收购一家视频游戏公司时，它说[原因是元宇宙](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/business/microsoft-activision-blizzard.html)。Facebook 现在以两件事而闻名：更名 Meta 进军元宇宙和股价下跌。在苹果 1 月份的财报电话会议上，蒂姆·库克说，元宇宙\"对我们来说非常有趣\"，他指出，苹果在应用商店中有超过 14000 个增强现实套件应用，因此 \"我们看到了这个领域的巨大潜力，并正在进行相应的投资\"。\n\n但这种 \"潜力 \"到底是什么？究竟主流公司希望从中得到什么？答案明显是 \"钱\"，因为 Grayscale [估计](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/25/grayscale-says-metaverse-is-a-trillion-dollar-market-opportunity/)在元宇宙中有 1 万亿美元的市场机会。(Grayscale，即灰度，是 CoinDesk 的母公司 Digital Currency Group 的一个部门；DCG 也是 Decentraland 的重要投资者）。但是，具体是怎么做到呢？Hackl 列举了一些典型要素：宣传、客户获取、客户参与、客户保留，以及——也许是最让人感兴趣的奖励——新的收入来源。\n\n数字服装，数字自行车，在你的 Decentraland 家中，对楼上的浴室进行数字化装修。听起来很疯狂是吗？花 290 万美元买一只数字猿的想法也是如此，但这都是真的。\" Threedium 公司的首席营销官Michael Toner 说：\"我们现在正在进入这个时代，在这里，我们对数字所有权的重视程度，与我们对实体所有权的重视程度相当。“\n\nToner 说，这个数字所有权的世界与我们目前的现实世界并没有什么不同。\n\n\"今天，人们已经习惯于购买数字资产和购买电子书。这对人们来说不是一个奇怪的概念，\" Toner 说，将这一概念扩展到数字 \"手表、小玩意、装饰品和绘画\"，并不需要大费周章。\n\n他说，越来越多的客户希望创建现实世界物体的 \"数字双胞胎\"。例如，在即将举行的[元宇宙时装周](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/what-fashion-week-looks-like-in-the-metaverse)上，你可以直接从 Decentraland 上购买 Hugo Boss 的实体衣服。在 Toner 看来，\"我们正在进入元电子商务时代\"。\n\n**元宇宙中的营销**\n\n如果说数字高潮是一个难做的买卖，那么销售数字啤酒似乎也同样棘手。但在 2020 年，时任百威英博啤酒集团——这家公司拥有百威啤酒、科罗娜啤酒、贝克啤酒以及几乎所有非精酿普通啤酒——全球创新主管的 Lindsey McInerney 却有一种预感，它可能会成功。\n\nLindsey McInerney 不是那种典型的营销主管。她写过一篇关于 20 世纪 70 年代滑板场景的论文，她研究了黑客主义的诞生，她更关心文化而不是公司。然后现实来袭，她才意识到她的 \"文化研究 \"学位没有实际效用。所以她转向了公关，但\"差点被公关学校踢出来\"，因为她的新闻稿中包含了一个（当时还是）新的、不被认可的网站——YouTube——的链接。这在当时是被禁止的，现在则是标准操作。\n\nMcInerney 总是逆向思维，在成为 Web2 社交媒体专家的同时（在社交媒体舆情服务公司 Hootsuite，负责创新），她一直关注着虚拟现实和区块链。当她被百威英博聘用时，你以为她会专注于啤酒、啤酒花和大麦，并没有。McInerney 写了一篇关于 Web3 和元宇宙的论文，这让她的同事感到惊讶，因为她认为这是公司需要了解的 \"地震式转变\"。\n\n\"这就是地震，\" McInerney 说，并重复强调了这一点，\"这比社交媒体要大得多。它和电子商务比则是旗鼓相当，只大不小。\"她说，\"元宇宙和 Web3 的融合正在以我从未感受过的速度发生。从来没有这么快过。\"\n\n作为一个试点项目，McInerney 说服高层领导，为与加密赛马游戏 [Zed Run](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/27/fake-horses-real-bets-unikrn-is-putting-racetrack-nfts-on-ethereum/) 的合作开绿灯。（想想一场虚拟的肯塔基德比）（译者注：肯塔基德比是美国赛马三冠大赛第一关）。McInerney 有信心，公司的优质比尔森啤酒 Stella Artois（译者注：时代啤酒）的品牌形象与 Zed Run 的高端世界完全吻合，她将其描述为 \"元宇宙中最负盛名的游戏\"。百威英博投放了定制的 Stella Artois 皮肤（用于定制游戏角色的外观），拍卖了虚拟马匹，推出了一个新的三维赛马场。这种合作向百威英博多年来的 \"[The Life Artois](https://www.stellaartois.com/en_us/initiatives/the-life-artois/) \"活动致敬，而且主流啤酒品牌首次进入了元宇宙。\n\n结果试点项目取得了爆炸性进展。McInerney 说，该品牌在第一周获得了超过1亿的媒体流量，获得了《[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/18/stella-artois-gallops-into-the-metaverse-with-horse-racing-nfts/?sh=7267b9a57b8b)》和《广告周刊》的报道。她认为这只是未来发展的一个小小缩影。\"这不仅仅是关于电子商务的，\" McInerney 说，\"这也不仅仅是关于你在互联网上销售能力的未来，它是所有板块的未来。”\n\n另一个 \"板块\"：客户奖励计划。这是营销学的基本原理，会员计划中的客户——如常旅客账户——更忠诚，更有利可图。这只是一个开始。\n\n\"我们都知道会员计划有多糟糕，\"阿迪达斯的全球品牌传播经理 Kevin Wright 说，该公司已经大力投入到元宇宙中。\"哦，伙计，它们太糟糕了，糟透了，它们很麻烦。奖励\\[可能\\]是莫名其妙的。它们会过期。\" Wright 澄清说，现在还为时尚早，\"我们还没有搞清楚一切。\"但基于代币的会员计划，有可能提供更好的客户体验——比如说，可以编程，可以做某些事情，或者更容易转换和交换。其他 Web3 专家也同意，例如 Jeremiah Owyang，他最近[给了我这个预测](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/the-social-token-network-rally-friends-with-benefits-and-the-future-of-branding/)：\"品牌将把他们的忠诚度计划积分转化为社交代币\"。\n\n然后，Wright 还发现了元宇宙的一个隐藏优点：它还是一个会计游戏。Wright 说，当公司提供奖励计划时，这些积分为 \"品牌创造了巨大的财务责任\"。就像银行需要手头有充足的现金一样，公司需要抵御一种风险：客户积累的奖励积分——就像常客里程一样——可能爆发式集中兑换的风险。\n\n\"这种情况从未发生过，但如果每个人都想在同一天\\[兑换\\]他们的星巴克免费饮品，星巴克就有麻烦了，\" Wright 说。这就是为什么 \"会计成为了一场噩梦\"。Wright 说，元宇宙中基于代币的会员计划将解决这个令人头痛的财务问题。(确切的机制仍未确定，但这与[德勤报告](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-making-blockchain-real-for-loyalty-rewards-programs.pdf)指出的 \"无人认领的奖励，在公司的资产负债表上被视为负债 \"相吻合，并建议将其用基于区块链的代币替代。） \"我们花了很多时间与产品设计师讨论元宇宙，但我也想与我们的会计师讨论元宇宙，\" Wright 笑着说。\n\n还有其他不那么显而易见的应用场景。安永会计师事务所（原 Ernst & Young 会计师事务所）专注于元宇宙的顾问 Janet Balis 说，虽然大多数最初的案例都是针对 \"B-to-C\"（企业对消费者），但她预测我们将看到更多 B-to-B（企业对企业）的案例。想想在新冠疫情期间有多少贸易展变成了线上的。想想所有的 Zoom 会议。这些活动将来会有许多回到线下，但应该不会全都回去。\n\nBalis 说：\"我确实认为，在 B-to-B 的场景中，有些活动有机会在元宇宙中被办得更好，或者被元宇宙的体验所取代。“(有一家公司已经尝试了通过元宇宙增强体验的方式，CoinDesk，在新冠疫情的高峰期，在 Decentraland 的会议中心开了一次[虚拟大会](https://twitter.com/BitcoinLouie/status/1316740611945439232?s=20&t=KmJZq32fg2CkHUnta97fBA)）。\n\n然后还有公司内部的可能性。Balis 说：”这是一个在更有创意的环境中录用新员工的机会，即使人们在家里工作。“在她为《哈佛商业评论》写的[一篇文章](https://hbr.org/2022/01/how-brands-can-enter-the-metaverse)中（这是主流接受度的另一个信号），Balis 指出，元宇宙可以用来培训未来的外科医生，微软的 \"mesh \"平台在元宇宙式的协作空间中提供了化身，而芯片制造商”[英伟达相信](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/08/10/what-is-the-metaverse/)，投资于制造和物流等方面的元宇宙模拟技术，将减少浪费并加速更优商业解决方案的出现。\" 而现在波音公司正在元宇宙中[设计飞机](https://www.reuters.com/technology/boeing-wants-build-its-next-airplane-metaverse-2021-12-17/)。\n\n我好奇地想知道元宇宙在加密货币泡沫之外的延伸程度，于是我联系了一家传统的咨询公司 Want Branding，该公司与区块链毫无关系——其客户广泛，包括吉列和米高梅度假集团。\"我们与所有不同垂直领域的公司有较高水平的合作，每个人都在思考这个问题，\"该公司的首席营销官 John Downey 说，\"越来越多的客户问我们，从品牌的角度来看，进入元宇宙意味着什么？”\n\n安永会计师事务所也发现了同样的情况。\"我认为对于面向消费者的公司来说，绝大多数会有一个营销或客户体验高管，开始关注元宇宙，\" Balis 说。安永甚至有一个以元宇宙为中心的部门，最近还写了一篇题为 \" CEO 们，是时候进入元宇宙了 \"的[博文](https://www.ey.com/en_in/ceo/ceos-it-is-time-to-enter-the-metaverse)。安永的竞争对手德勤推出了自己的元宇宙商店，[宣布](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-launches-unlimited-reality-services.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:metapr:eng:cons:01132022:building%20a%20metaverse:b:c:kwd-1545562415717&gclid=Cj0KCQiAjc2QBhDgARIsAMc3SqQkNC07bCHfwsnybK00OyGGKEBGcvgghPTS_Yh1Ky-2ObvEnkqHQKkaAl9qEALw_wcB)成立 \"Unlimited Reality（无限现实）\"工作室\"帮助教育、激励、加速和执行客户的元宇宙目标\"。\n\n**敛财与元宇宙**\n\n\"仅仅因为你能做到，并不意味着你应该这样做，\" McInerney 说。\"你的 logo 绝对没有内在的价值，无论你有多爱它，但没有人在乎。\"她想确保百威英博别搞砸，不做任何看起来像抢钱的事情，比如推出 10000 个 NFT 并希望获得神奇的收入，她明白这种诱惑。通过设计的营销推广，几乎总是砸钱的事。它们的成本是硬性的，收益却很模糊。这就是为什么 McInerney 说，许多营销人员现在在想，\"我的天哪！我们不能成为一个成本中心！这可真是太好了！”\n\n只有一个问题，如果它看起来影响不好或贪婪，正如 McInerney 所说，\"没人会再买你的东西。\"\n\n倩碧分享了自己不敛财的经验，它是最早进军元宇宙的美妆品牌之一。倩碧没有销售 NFT ，而是让消费者在 Instagram 上分享正能量的故事（它把这个活动称为 \"MetaOptimist\"）。倩碧向获胜者赠送了 NFT 和 10 年的产品，[比如一位生病的母亲](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW_Vr_Up-b5/)，她每天都带着 \"希望和乐观 \"开始工作，她的儿子正在变得更强大，更聪明。倩碧的全球消费者参与部副总裁 Roxanne Iyer 说，活动的目标是 \"使忠诚度现代化，并推动对品牌的渗透。\"她很高兴的看到搜索量和品牌知名度飙升 20%。\n\n并非每个活动都那么成功。百事可乐的 NFT 发布时，营销部的主管们都担忧其反响。当百事可乐的 twitter 操作发布其 NFT 时，很快 Meta 就回复说：\"这在元宇宙中会很好看。\"百事可乐则回复说：\"还是你懂我，朋友！\" 正如一位品牌专家所说，\"这似乎是不真实的。Web3 对此的反应是，这只是奉承\"。\n\n其他公司还在观望，它们需要更多的数据。\" Balis 说：\"我认为这不只是风险和担忧，而更多的是未回答的问题。法律方面的考虑是什么？税收将如何处理？监管方面正在发生什么？这些都是阿迪达斯不得不解决的问题，这对一个全球品牌来说其实是很棘手的。\n\n\"我们有超过 6 万名员工，\" Wright 说。\"我们是一个庞大的集团，有非常多品牌代表。\" 比方说，阿迪达斯的欧洲足球部门的内部运作方式，可能和美国的足球部门不太一样。\n\n或者考虑一下财务问题。在欧洲，该公司使用欧元，在美国，使用美元，然后元宇宙内的交易手续费需要用代币支付。\"当然，在这种规模下和这么多国家间，情况变得相当复杂，\" Wright 说，\"它的运转一直是非常庞杂的。”\n\n当 NARS 发布“高潮”系列 NFT 时，Fierro 不得不应对各种挑战。\"它们每个都需要一个精雕细琢的生产过程，花费了相当大的时间精力，\" Fierro 说，\"坦率地讲，这需要一定程度的预算和投资，而很多品牌目前还没有分配这种预算和投资\"。\n\n然后，还有一个事实是，元宇宙的概念仍然在不断演化。\n\n\"我们没有看到全方位的公司探索不同用例的原因，是由于规模问题，\" Balis 说，她说的 \"规模 \"是指它还没有完全施展开来，它还是互相割裂的。在 Roblox 中正常的 3D 图像在 Sandbox 中可能无法辨认( Sandbox 是一款移动游戏，而不是字面意义上的沙盒）。\n\n\"有些元宇宙只能通过虚拟现实头戴设备访问“，Balis 说，\"有些元宇宙只能通过台式电脑访问。”有些只支持移动端，有些是中心化的，有些是去中心化的。这事儿得花不少时间去琢磨。\n\n对于阿迪达斯的 Wright 来说，最大的挑战仍然是整体性的对加密货币的怀疑，以及长期以来，对它所包含的许多内容的厌恶——诈骗、投机、跑路。在获得企业的支持方面， Wright 说：\"在 OpenSea 上每发生一个被骗的故事，我们就会失去 10 到 15 个客户。”\n\n从某种意义上说，这与品牌专家通常对品牌的思考方式并没有什么不同。\n\n\"我不认为关于元宇宙的品牌或广告问题与在其他地方有什么不同，\" Balis 说，我们还是问类似的问题，\"这里有我的潜在客户么？这是一个我觉得可以创造优质体验的环境吗？”\n\n其他问题：我能否以一种真实的方式将我的品牌带入生活？我可以用符合我们价值观的方式讲述我的故事吗？正如 Balis 所说，\"一些创意形式将是新的，但我不认为这些问题有什么不同。\"\n\n## 百威英博的奇特酿造\n\n在百威英博，McInerney 铿锵有力地回答了这些问题，然后她确定，是的，将啤酒带入元宇宙确实是有意义的。这最终让我们回到了核心问题上——\"在元宇宙中喝啤酒 \"到底是什么意思，这怎么会不荒唐呢？在欢乐时光，我更喜欢喝生啤，或者是瓶装，罐装也可以，但它不太可能是一张 JPEG 图片。\n\n我把我的困惑告诉了 McInerney ，她给出了一个令人信服的反驳。\n\n她说：\"我不能边喝酒边开车，但你经常看到高速公路上的广告牌，都是酒精广告。或者她会在星期二的中午收到啤酒的广告，\"而我在工作，不能喝酒\"。\n\n她的观点是，是的，虚拟啤酒可能无法与你实际饮用的冰镇饮料相媲美，但也许它比你从传统广告中得到的 \"印象 \"更好。\n\n\"我们可以做得比高速公路上的广告牌，或者比周二中午的啤酒推文广告要好得多，\"已经离开百威英博的 McInerney 说，她现在正在创办自己的聚焦 Web3 和元宇宙的公司。\"我们真的可以给那些想玩品牌的人带来惊喜和快乐。”\n\n而在未来，也许这些啤酒真的可以被饮用。McInerney 建议进行数字和实物的混合体验，也许是在观看赛马的时候。\n\n\"我的设想是，你和我将能够在两个不同的地方各自赛马。\" 她在伦敦，我在丹佛。\"我们可以登录 Zed Run 网站。我们可以选择几场比赛参加。\" 我们分享这种数字体验。我们也可能在元宇宙中去 Decentraland 的 Zed Run 酒吧。\n\n\"我会先买一轮，因为这才对嘛，\"McInerney 说。然后在 20 分钟内， Uber Eats把一瓶真实的啤酒送到我在丹佛的家门口，另一瓶真实的啤酒出现在 McInerney 在伦敦的家。\"我们可以有一个共同的'数字-实物体验'，我们在享受 Stella 啤酒的同时，进行我们的赛马比赛。”\n\n有些人可能认为这个未来是令人兴奋的。有些人则认为它是令人绝望的。但越来越多的公司将其视为完全不同的东西：这是有利可图的。\n\n\n---\n\n原文\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/08/virtual-beers-and-digital-orgasms-welcome-to-the-age-of-metaverse-commerce/](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/08/virtual-beers-and-digital-orgasms-welcome-to-the-age-of-metaverse-commerce/)\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HMdTMO0BJEsmT8JTsmDax.png?height=733&width=600)\n\n",

Media报道，韩国科技巨头Hancom旗下加密子公司Arowana Hub推出的加密项目遭遇诉讼，Arowana Coin代币投资者面临大规模亏损风险。首尔中央地方法院6日接受了对Arowana Coin投资的普通投资者的债权临时扣押申请。因此，钱包管理人Hexlant保管的Arowana基金会所有的4.3亿多枚Arowana Coin被临时扣押，在诉讼结束之前这些代币禁止移动。普通投资者索赔的损失金额为800亿韩元（约合6089万美元）。如果投资者赢了，法院最多可以将5000万枚Arowana Coin代币在不锁仓的情况下转给投资者，并允许投资者在交易所出售。\n\n此前，投资者与Hancom签订了5000万枚Arowana Coin投资合同，并支付了这笔钱。Hancom曾承诺将在2021年代币上线交易所后将这些代币转移至投资者的钱包中，但并未兑现。Arowana Coin于2021年上线Bithumb交易所后，立即暴涨超1000%。投资人声称，就算是按照Arowana Coin最低价计算，损失金额也达到了1156亿韩元（约合8799万美元）。而投资者与Hancom的代币投资合同发生纠纷，Bithumb对此未进行披露，被质疑没有对投资者采取保护措施。据悉，Arowana (ARW) 项目是一个处理黄金等实物资产价值的区块链平台，有人怀疑金Arowana Coin被用于为Hancom董事长金相哲筹集行贿资金，调查仍在进行中。Hancom公司随后对法院扣押资金一事提出异议，称申请临时扣押的投资者与Aronawa Hub没有债务关系。\n\n[英国《金融时报》推出加密金融板块](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/p80uo24n.html)\n\n据FinanceFeeds报道，英国《金融时报》推出了Cryptofinance板块，这是一个集合加密货币报道的新的数字中心和每周通讯，旨在揭示数字资产行业以及创新如何影响主流金融。\n\n[外媒：美国SEC官员回应称SEC尚未就BNB向币安发出传票](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/tu83e2yt.html)\n\n加密媒体CoinDesk根据《信息自由法》向SEC提交了一份“SEC就调查BNB代币向币安发出的传票”的请求被退回，但一位SEC官员在回复中写道：“根据你在信中提供的信息，我们对SEC的各种记录系统进行了彻底搜索，但没有找到或识别任何响应你请求的信息。”据悉，彭博社曾于6月份报道，美国SEC正在调查BNB代币是否为未注册的证券，对此赵长鹏回应币安就其产品与当局保持定期联系，并否认该公司已被传唤。\n\n[三箭资本创始人Su

Zhu还表示，他们未预料到LUNA能在几天内跌至归零，并引发整个行业的信贷紧缩，从而对三箭所有流动性不足的头寸造成巨大压力。尽管如此，该基金仍能够继续从大型数字资产贷方和富有的投资者那里借款，直到这些机构本身陷入危机。在LUNA崩盘后，Su Zhu表示贷方对三箭资本的财务状况“感到满意”，并允许他们继续交易。\n\n对于外界质疑其“奢靡”的生活，Su Zhu表示：“此前传闻的破产之际支付5000万美元首付买游艇的消息不实，那艘游艇是1年前委托建造的，并且有完整的资金来源。我每天骑自行车上下班，和我的家人在新加坡只有两个家。出问题时总有人喜欢写出这样的新闻。”在回答有关该公司哪里出了问题时，Su Zhu提到了多年牛市带来的过度自信，牛市不仅注入了他和Davies的思维力，还注入了几乎所有的行业信贷基础设施，在这些领域，因为有像他这样的融资公司，贷方看到了他们的价值膨胀。\n\n[BlockFi第二季度透明度报告：有18亿美元未偿贷款，已制定流动性指导方案](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/h1584h4x.html)\n\n据Cointelegraph报道，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，加密借贷公司BlockFi披露，截至第二季度末，公司拥有来自机构和散户投资者的18亿美元未偿贷款，其中6亿美元是无抵押贷款。机构贷款占未偿贷款总额的15亿美元，而散户贷款占剩余的3亿美元。\n\nBlockFi表示已经制定指导方案，以帮助其保持必要的流动性来履行核心业务活动，包括机构和零售借贷和交易活动。该指导方案将根据客户的需求在库存中持有至少10%的总金额，并准备好退还给客户。还将在可在7天内收回并返还给客户的地方持有至少50%的欠款，并将根据需要将欠客户总额的至少90%用于存货或可偿还的贷款中。这类贷款将在一年内召回。\n\n[Coinbase发布二季度投资备忘录，Web

{"id": "q-NWUpOWJVUkw11CO6XwB-Fj_aBBmra5esp9uqOciAw", "title": "How Web3 Is Transforming the Gaming Industry", "body": "原文链接：[How Web3 Is Transforming the Gaming Industry](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/how-web3-is-transforming-the-gaming-industry/)\n\n[https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/how-web3-is-transforming-the-gaming-industry/](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/how-web3-is-transforming-the-gaming-industry/)\n\nWe are seeing growth in independent gaming studios utilizing web3\n\n我们看到独立游戏工作室利用 Web3 收获的增长。\n\nWeb3，作为一个概念，只有不到十年的历史，但它作为一个技术发展的框架已经开始流行。Web3 在游戏中找到了它最有反应能力的受众和开发者群体，而游戏本身就是一个增长型产业。但是，Web3 去中心化的游戏方法在游戏创作和区块链技术的交汇处特别活跃。\n\nOne of the signs of a gaming revival is the growth in independent gaming studios. In 2022, game building is extremely active: as many as [25 new games](https://techjury.net/blog/video-games-industry-statistics/#gref) appear on Steam each day. There are more than 2,500 US-based game studios, but game development is no longer regionally restricted and in the hands of a few gaming giants. Instead, there is a variety of creative teams, taking up multiple avenues of development.\n\n游戏复兴的标志之一是独立游戏工作室的增长。在2022年，游戏建设极为活跃：每天有多达25个新游戏出现在 Steam 上。美国有2500多家游戏工作室，但游戏开发不再受地区限制，不再掌握在少数游戏巨头手中。相反，有各种各样的创意团队，占据了多种开发途径。\n\n## Web3: Create a Sandbox Experience\n\nThe concept of Web3 brings user-generated content to gaming. Modding, for instance, proved especially successful for creators and highly appealing for players. Novelty demand and building on the common game framework of Minecraft was a huge success for Microsoft. [Minecraft modding](https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-modders-have-sold-a-billion-mods-for-more-than-dollar350m-since-microsoft-bought-it/) led to a billion official downloads and $350M in additional income since 2017. Then, there is the free, open-source modding through informal channels.\n\nWeb3 的概念为游戏带来了用户生成的内容。例如，游戏改装(Modding)被证明对创作者特别成功，对玩家也有很大吸引力。新奇的需求和建立在《Minecraft》的共同游戏框架上，对微软来说是巨大的成功。自2017年以来，《Minecraft》的 MOD 导致了10亿次官方下载和3.5亿美元的额外收入。然后，还有通过非正式渠道的免费、开源的修改。\n\n[Web3](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/web3/) expands the appeal of making your own world and actually owning it. This concept is already built into several metaverse games on the blockchain, which focus on providing building opportunities and then lets their players create unscripted unique digital 3D venues. The model was successful for top metaverse games like Decentraland, The Sandbox and other simulated worlds.\n\nWeb3 扩大了制造你自己的世界并实际拥有它的吸引力。这个概念已经内置于区块链上的几个元老级游戏中，这些游戏专注于提供建设机会，然后让他们的玩家创造无脚本的独特数字3D场所。这种模式对于像 Decentraland, The Sandbox 和其他模拟世界这样的顶级元空间游戏是成功的。\n\nWeb3 world-building is free creation open to almost anyone with the right skills, with no limit to potential earnings and fame. In traditional gaming, the studio would reap all the praise and income, which Web3 now releases to a whole new scene of creators.\n\nWeb3 的世界建设是免费的创作，几乎对任何有适当技能的人开放，对潜在的收入和名声没有限制。在传统的游戏中，工作室将获得所有的赞誉和收入，而 Web3 现在向一个全新的创造者场景发布。\n\nAlexis Ohanian, the Co-Founder and Director of Reddit and serial Internet entrepreneur, has noted the value hidden in incipient Web3 projects. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mY7C4PKsCI&ab_channel=BloombergTechnology), Ohanian explained the growth of Web2 was about content – the so-called read and write part of the Internet. “All that Web3 jargon we see, it’s about the third part, ownership.” Ohanian sees gaming and NFTs as the beginnings of infrastructure that will have tremendous implications down the line.\n\nReddit 的联合创始人兼董事、连续的互联网企业家 Alexis Ohanian 注意到了隐藏在新生的Web3 项目中的价值。在最近的一次采访中，Ohanian 解释说，Web2 的增长是关于内容的——互联网的所谓读写部分。\"我们看到的所有 Web3 的行话，都是关于第三部分，即所有权。\" Ohanian 认为游戏和 NFTs 是基础设施的开端，将在未来产生巨大的影响。\n\n## Web3: The Key to Value Ownership\n\nOne of the concepts of Web3 is owning your own resources and value. In gaming, there are many ways in which the player can create a scarce resource. World creation and [metaverse land plots](https://play2moon.com/metaverse-land-101-starting-out-with-digital-nft-plots/), crafting, equipment upgrades or characters leveling up, are all that can be reflected in decentralized records. Even the time spent playing the game can be added to the balance of each individual player.\n\nWeb3 的概念之一是拥有自己的资源和价值。在游戏中，玩家有很多方法可以创造稀缺资源。世界的创造和元气的地块(metaverse land plots)，手工制作，装备升级或人物等级提升，都可以体现在去中心化的记录中。甚至玩游戏的时间也可以加到每个玩家的余额中。\n\nGaming already produces a seemingly limitless inflow of [hours spent](https://steamcharts.com/) on perfecting one’s progress. Take Elden Ring, a recent hit – almost half a million players were spending hundreds of thousands of hours exploring the game and testing out strategies.\n\n游戏已经产生了一个看似无限的流入，花在完善一个人的进步上的时间。以最近的热门游戏《艾尔登环》为例——几乎有50万玩家花了数十万小时探索游戏和测试策略。\n\n[Gaming activity](https://www.limelight.com/lp/state-of-online-gaming-2021/) increased by 14% in 2021, a recent survey reveals. Players on average spend more than eight hours and 27 minutes on games per week. Some of the gamers tried to monetize their gameplay through Web2 channels and social media, with over [8.8 billion hours of streamed games](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1125469/video-game-stream-hours-watched/#:\\~:text=Video%20game%20live%20streaming%20hours%20watched%202019%2D2021&text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,billion%20hours%20two%20years%20previously.) which are watched over the course of a year.\n\n一项调查显示，游戏活动在2021年增加了14%。玩家平均每周在游戏上花费超过8小时27分钟。一些游戏玩家试图通过Web2渠道和社交媒体来实现游戏的货币化，一年中，有超过88亿小时的流媒体游戏被观看。\n\nBut, there are many more ways to extract the value of gaming and track one’s progress. The blockchain is the perfect tool to wrap up game achievements, so they cannot be erased or modified. Players need not become streamers in order to monetize the hours played. Rather, they can tokenize them on the blockchain, with several powerful tools to turn their gaming progress into an asset. The potential for tokenization has spread to many types of games, including simulated sports, puzzles or even chess tournaments with NFT and tokens.\n\n但是，还有很多方法可以提取游戏的价值并跟踪一个人的进展。区块链是打包游戏成就的完美工具，区块链让游戏成就不能被抹去或修改。玩家不需要为了使游戏时间货币化而成为流作家。相反，他们可以在区块链上将其代币化，用几个强大的工具将他们的游戏进展变成一种资产。代币化的潜力已经扩散到许多类型的游戏，包括模拟体育、拼图甚至是用NFT和代币进行的国际象棋比赛。\n\n## What Are the Tools for Web3 Gaming in 2022\n\nWeb3 is no longer just vaporware but offers sufficient tools to take your value and achievements with you. Lightweight cryptocurrency wallets can now connect to the app you use, and almost seamlessly increase your balance in exchange for your regular digital activities. The infrastructure is already there: blockchains run 24/7, and smart contracts can listen for events and distribute value.\n\nWeb3 不再只是蒸发器，而是提供足够的工具，让你的价值和成就与你同行。轻量级的加密货币钱包现在可以连接到你使用的应用程序，并几乎无缝地增加你的余额，以换取你的常规数字活动。基础设施已经存在：区块链24/7运行，智能合约可以监听事件并分配价值。\n\nA blockchain can compensate users in two major ways. One, by paying out tokens, which will work like digital money and give a certain value to the gameplay. And two, by creating unique NFT items shaped by game experience. For instance, the hours spent upgrading your game hero with equipment, enchantments, skills, or other items can be translated into a rare or unique non-fungible token (NFT), which can then be resold or kept as a store of value.\n\n区块链可以通过两种主要方式对用户进行补偿。其一，通过支付代币，这将像数字货币一样工作，并赋予游戏的一定价值。第二，通过创造由游戏经验塑造的独特NFT项目。例如，用装备、魔法、技能或其他物品升级你的游戏英雄所花费的时间，可以转化为稀有或独特的不可伪造的代币（NFT），然后可以出售或保留作为价值储存。\n\n## What Is the Problem with the Play-to-Earn Model\n\nGame and blockchain developers already had all the tools to turn a user into a point of value generation. This translated into the simple idea of getting paid for gaming. For a few months, the model looked very promising and sparked great enthusiasm, especially for the Axie Infinity game. At one point, playing Axies could produce a reasonably high monthly income, leading to a gold rush.\n\n游戏和区块链开发者已经有了所有的工具，可以把用户变成一个价值产生点。这转化为通过游戏获得报酬的简单想法。几个月来，这个模式看起来非常有前途，并引发了巨大的热情，比如说 Axie Infinity。一时间，玩 Axies 可以产生相当高的月收入，导致了淘金热。\n\nA few problems immediately arose from this. Players were paid in crypto tokens, and to spend the funds, they had to convert the tokens to fiat. But, all the selling depressed the token price and destroyed the intended economic model.\n\n由此立即产生了一些问题。玩家是以加密代币支付的，为了花掉这些资金，他们必须将代币转换成法币。但是，所有的销售都压低了代币价格，破坏了预期的经济模式。\n\nThe second problem is that traditional gamers are sometimes averse to using [crypto](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/crypto/) assets. Even in the best-case scenario, they can have a steep learning curve to get on board cryptocurrency usage. So, projects have to be proactive about their user cultivation process, instead of setting up their potential clients on a rather complicated path of learning crypto first and then come back for the game. Projects like [EVOS.gg](https://evos.gg/) already have a form of seamless onboarding, with an exclusive wallet set up for the gamer to accrue any tokens and NFT prizes. There is no need to visit a crypto exchange, understand networks and fees, or buy anything in advance.\n\n第二个问题是，传统的游戏玩家有时对使用加密货币资产感到厌恶。即使在最好的情况下，他们也会有一个陡峭的学习曲线来加入加密货币的使用。因此，项目必须积极主动地培养用户，而不是让他们的潜在客户走上一条相当复杂的道路，先学习加密货币，然后再回来玩游戏。像EVOS.gg 这样的项目已经有了一种无缝上岗的形式，为游戏者设置了一个专属的钱包来累积任何代币和NFT奖品。不需要访问加密货币交易所，了解网络和费用，或提前购买任何东西。\n\nBut, the most important thing to avoid is to copy a model where players strip-mine the game of value, and they play just to grind out as many tokens as possible. This is not viable for the game, and we have many examples where the P2E model is already depleted, while the game team is just starting out to improve their product. The goal of Web3 should be to add value, and not to extract all value from a game until it is no longer fun to play.\n\n但是，最重要的是要避免复制一种模式，即玩家对游戏的价值进行剥离式开采，他们玩的目的只是为了尽可能多地赚取代币。这对游戏来说是不可行的，我们有很多例子，表明 P2E 模式已经被耗尽，而游戏团队刚刚开始改进他们的产品。Web3 的目标应该是增加价值，而不是从一个游戏中提取所有的价值，直到它不再有乐趣。\n\n## Web3 and Voting: What the DAO Changes for Gamers\n\nWeb3 can create a whole new type of community. Let’s speak of the [DAO](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/dao/), or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. This is where the community can decide for itself where the project is going. There are already multiple examples of successful DAO where asset owners can vote and direct the project.\n\nWeb3 可以创造一种全新的社区类型。让我们说说DAO，即分散的自治组织。这就是社区可以自己决定项目的走向。已经有多个成功的DAO的例子，资产所有者可以投票并指导项目。\n\nThis is a new form of governance, replacing the opaque decision-making process of the corporation with a technological hub where each decision is visible and accessible to the whole community. The access point to this structure is, again, ownership. So, it’s double participation, once by owning a piece of the project, and again when having the right to decide on its future.\n\n这是一种新的治理形式，用一个技术中心取代了公司不透明的决策过程，在这个技术中心，每一个决定都是可见的，并且可以被整个社区访问。这个结构的接入点，依然是，所有权。因此，这是双重参与，一次是拥有项目的一部分，另一次是有权决定项目的未来。\n\nBlockchain voting somewhat resembles shareholder rights, though DAO is even more democratized, with almost no geographical limitations to ownership. And of course, shareholder votes do not happen on the blockchain and need human intermediaries. All a DAO needs is a well-built collection of smart contracts, where the code is entirely transparent and predictable.\n\n区块链投票有点类似于股东权利，尽管DAO的民主化程度更高，对所有权几乎没有地域限制。当然，股东投票也不会发生在区块链上，需要人类中介。DAO所需要的是一个精心构建的智能合约集合，其中的代码是完全透明和可预测的。\n\nDAO is where the question of personal participation is answered. One of the critical points for Web3 is the need to buy assets, often high-priced, with no real game in production. This has been very worrisome for Web3 investors, and it is true that some of the projects collected funds and proved to be nothing more than a money-grabbing operation. But, others offered the advantage of early access, and then went on to build a complex, stunning hub of value and entertainment. The early investors were justly rewarded for their foresight and patience and, of course, for taking an asymmetric risk with a high reward potential.\n\nDAO 是回答个人参与问题的地方。Web3 的关键点之一是需要购买资产，往往是高价的，没有真正的游戏在生产。这让 Web3 的投资者非常担心，确实有一些项目收集了资金，并被证明只不过是一种圈钱的行为。但是，其他项目提供了早期访问的优势，然后继续建立一个复杂的、令人惊叹的价值和娱乐的中心。早期投资者因其远见和耐心得到了合理的回报，当然，他们也承担了具有高回报潜力的不对称风险。\n\nIt is not always necessary to have an overpriced [NFT](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/nfts/) to participate in a DAO. Sometimes, token ownership is enough. But, it raises an interesting issue, in Web3, each user has some skin in the game. Part of the curation and decision-making process hinges on dedicated fans, who are willing to offer value upfront and build their own little corner of Web3, whether it is a DAO, a metaverse location or a game economy.\n\n参加 DAO 并不总是需要拥有高价的NFT。有时，代币所有权就足够了。但是，这提出了一个有趣的问题，在 Web3 中，每个用户在游戏中都有一些皮肤。策划和决策过程的一部分取决于热心的粉丝，他们愿意预先提供价值，并建立他们自己的 Web3 的小角落，无论是 DAO、元宇宙空间位置还是游戏经济。\n\nWhen players produce NFT or tokens based on their gameplay, they can also show loyalty by staking or voting. In Web3 games, they will not only be game consumers but have partial ownership of the game.\n\n当玩家通过他们的游戏产生NFT或代币时，他们也可以通过押注或投票来显示忠诚度。在 Web3 游戏中，他们不仅是游戏消费者，而且对游戏有部分所有权。\n\n## Do Players Really Need to But In to Use Web3?\n\nMany projects try to build themselves up as an exclusive club, requiring a significant buy-in. And for some, it worked to create a sense of exclusivity in an over-saturated information market. But there are ways to use Web3 features without requiring a big upfront investment.\n\n许多项目试图把自己打造成一个独家俱乐部，需要大量的买入。而对某些人来说，这在过度饱和的信息市场中创造了一种排他性的感觉。但是，有一些方法可以在不需要大量前期投资的情况下使用 Web3 的功能。\n\nPlayers can start achieving and building while having fun. And after that, they can wrap up the content and own it, upgrade and resell if they want. Games don't need to optimize for token operations and value, but they may become a play-to-earn combination, which takes the full gaming experience and turns it into NFTs, short term rewards and long-term voting rights.\n\n玩家可以在享受乐趣的同时开始实现和建设。而在这之后，他们可以把内容打包起来（译注：即打包成 NFT），并拥有它，如果他们愿意，可以升级和转售。游戏不需要为代币运营和价值进行优化，但它们可能会成为从玩到赚的组合，这需要完整的游戏体验并将其转化为NFT、短期奖励和长期投票权。\n\nProjects like Bored Ape Yacht Club added a 'cool' dimension to the large upfront investment. BAYC avatars trading for more than 100 ETH are one of the more influential crypto societies. ApeCoin (APE) also boosted the NFT collection's influence, tying it all together with a metaverse-based game.\n\n像 Bored Ape 游艇俱乐部这样的项目为大量的前期投资增加了一个 \"酷 \"的层面。交易价格超过 100ETH 的 BAYC 化身是更有影响力的加密货币社团之一。APE 也提升了NFT系列的影响力，将其与一个基于元数据的游戏联系在一起。\n\nIt is also possible to take a game-first approach, with the value coming in as a logical extension of the game. No need to build up hype, all games have the capacity to build a dedicated community, which can then become empowered to use Web 3 elements. The blockchain gaming space has all the right tools, so it can onboard gamers that are not crypto-savvy, or are even somewhat crypto-averse.\n\n也可以采取游戏优先的方法，将价值作为游戏的逻辑延伸。不需要炒作，所有的游戏都有能力建立一个专门的社区，然后可以授权给他们使用 Web3 元素。区块链游戏领域拥有所有正确的工具，因此它可以接纳不懂加密货币的游戏者，甚至有点不喜欢加密货币的人。\n\nAnd, while Web3 may be the future, it is highly important to have a positive onboarding experience for as many users as possible. This is the only way that users will not be overwhelmed by terminology or find the project meaningless. Our approach is to build a fun game with a rewarding progress potential, and then offer the opportunity to wrap up that progress and participate in the larger Web3 ecosystem.\n\n而且，虽然 Web3 可能是未来的趋势，但对尽可能多的用户来说，有一个积极的上手体验是非常重要的。只有这样，用户才不会被术语所淹没，或者觉得这个项目毫无意义。推荐的方法是建立一个有趣的游戏，具有奖励性的进展潜力，然后提供机会来总结这个进展并参与更大的Web3 生态系统。", "timestamp": 1658546959, "digest": "t4GwbU54a789F1c5y0wbeFIgVxcCKtq7aaQY5VpyWN8", "contributor": "0x2a704f87CB047691139c6fEC103ffbb10F9C67a2"}
{"id": "XW5nZsINWFEICpMAKmN6AjoKR5fnQaE4jYaCYgrEwDA", "title": "BTC Hashrate Down by 26% in 30 Days: When Will the Crypto Bear End?", "body": "After the BTC hashrate hit a record high of 266.41EH/s on June 8, people thought that the vitality injected by miners, who run the crypto upstream, could save cryptocurrency from the prolonged slump and lead to market recovery. Yet, as central banks around the world raised interest rates to combat the soaring inflation, financial markets in many countries suffered panic-driven dumping. Affected by such external forces and macro policies, crypto finance has struggled to stay intact.\n\nData from CoinGecko shows that the total market cap of cryptocurrency has fallen below $1 trillion, a loss of nearly $2 trillion from its peak in November last year. In particular, the price of Bitcoin, as called “digital gold”, has plunged by over 70% from its peak in November 2021 and is now quoted at $19,721. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BNB, and ADA have all dropped by more than 60% since last year.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nCLIDna2XX72RGVZSb1jk.png?height=775&width=1400)\n\nThe continued price decline has also slashed the profit margins of crypto miners. Meanwhile, a growing number of medium-level mining rigs are approaching the shutdown price. Data from ViaBTC shows that assuming electricity costs $0.06 per kWh, according to the current BTC price, mining rigs such as Antminer S15, Whatsminer M21S, and other models have fallen below the shutdown price. From June 8 to July 11, the BTC hashrate had dropped by 26%.\n\nOn the one hand, miners have to pay for the normal expenses of running mining rigs; on the other hand, they are uncertain about the market trend in the second half of 2022. As such, BTC miners are no longer holding all their coins. According to Glassnode, the reserve balance of BTC miners has fallen to 1,819,038 BTC, a 7-month low. This is also the bottom point this year, which means that miners have been selling their BTC holdings.\n\n# When will the crypto bear end?\n\nThe MLIV Pulse Survey, which included 950 investors, shows that 60% of the respondents believe that the BTC price is more likely to fall to $10,000 sooner than it climbs to $30,000, and only 40% of the respondents felt differently. In terms of the external factors, many Fed officials have released “hawkish” signals. According to the latest news from CME’s Federal Reserve Watch, the probability of the Fed raising interest rates by 75 basis points in July is 90.6%.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VwNfS5ujXmR0aicK1fPZ2.png?height=720&width=1277)\n\nWe can tell that most investors are pessimistic about the market prospect of cryptocurrency. Signals such as miners selling their cryptos and the Fed hiking interest rates indicate that cryptos that are closely correlated with the U.S. stocks, especially the NASDAQ index, may suffer further price drops.\n\nHowever, according to the historical patterns recorded during past bear-bull cycles, “miners’ surrender” is a typical sign of a bottom. For example, Bitcoin bottomed out in 2018 when it fell below a key mining cost indicator. The price hit bottom again in late 2019 when Bitcoin plunged below the indicator. In March 2020, Bitcoin hit the mining cost for the third time and then began to rebound. Moreover, the price even reached its historical peak in 2021.\n\nMike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, tweeted that the BTC price may rebound this year as the market shows signs similar to the 2018 bottom. According to Yassine Elmandjra, a crypto analyst at ARK Investment Management, Bitcoin has traded below its 200 WMA and short-and long-term cost bases for only the fourth time in price history, levels that have historically marked generational bottoms.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CuTKcCQKtqBmoFr25VroM.png?height=863&width=720)\n\nLooking at financial markets worldwide, we notice that bears are generally shorter than bulls. According to a recent report from CNBC, the average length of a bear market is 289 days; bull markets, on the other hand, average 991 days. Therefore, even if Bitcoin is going through the toughest period ever, Bitcoin has survived tenaciously every time, as evidenced by its past performance. We are thus confident that it will stick through the current bear market as well. Therefore, crypto investors don’t have to get overwrought as they face the present market sluggishness.\n\nFind us here:\nWebsite ▶️ <https://www.coinex.com>\nTwitter ▶️ <https://twitter.com/coinexcom/>\nTelegram ▶️ <https://t.me/CoinExOfficialEN>\nMedium ▶️ <https://medium.com/@coinex>\nReddit ▶️ <https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinEx/>\nFacebook ▶️ <https://www.facebook.com/thecoinex/>\nInstagram ▶️ <https://www.instagram.com/coinexcom/>", "timestamp": 1658546897, "digest": "ApssPxtmvS9_pXYKDVlzzdc7yBtpjYJEO5R2Ij0-R5c", "contributor": "0xD5806ddb5249d34D389aB4D4a042AD24e05cef39"}

Such an access control model can protect users against snooping and protect the stability and security of the operating system \\[31\\]. When an Android app attempts to access the restricted resources, a security check is triggered to inspect whether proper permissions are granted. Lack of permission request will prevent access to the resource and further cease the corresponding function-ality or even crash the app. Therefore, it is essential for developers to know the permissions required of the invoked API. Unnecessary required permissions can pose three threats: (i) Too many required permissions may confuse users. Users suspect that the app hasunexpected behaviors, which leads to users uninstalling or unwilling to install the app; (*ii*) The permissions required by an app is an important feature in detecting Android malware. Unnecessary permissions will fool the detector and cause a false alarm; (*iii*) The app will incur security risks with unnecessary permissions. Once the app contains vulnerabilities that can be injected with tampered code, it is easy for an attacker to thwart user privacy or invoke sensitive APIs. Moreover, requesting unnecessary permissions may expand the attack surface and expose the Android operating system to a host of attacks, especially privilege escalation attacks \\[17\\].Therefore, to safeguard users’ privacy and protect the Android ecosystem, Android app developers are suggested to follow the principle of *least privilege*, *i.e.*, requesting a minimum set of permissions required to fulfill the apps’ functionality. Unfortunately, Android does not provide official documentation for the permission specifications (*i.e.*, a mapping between APIs and the required permissions), making it difficult for app developers to follow the least privilege rule, and further lead to security vulnerabilities such as permission over-privilege \\[17\\]. To address this problem, researchers have been working on developing methods that generate an accurate list, called a protection map, that maps Android APIs to the required permissions. The previous works that provide such protection maps include Stowaway \\[17\\], PScout \\[12\\], Axplorer \\[13\\], Arcade \\[9\\], PSGen \\[39\\], and most recently, Dynamo \\[14\\]. Stowaway empirically determines the permissions required in Android APIs using feedback-directed testing. PScout and Axplorer leverage control-flow reachability analysis on the source code of the Android framework to generate the mapping between APIs and permissions. Arcade proposes a path-sensitive method based on graph abstraction techniques to generate a more precise mapping. PSGen statically generatesthe protection map for Android NDK. Dynamo extracts the protection mapping through dynamic test. Dynamic testing methods (*e.g.*, Stowaway and Dynamo) can accurately map the required permissions to API invocations that they have tested; however, such dynamic approaches suffer from an intrinsic shortcoming of low coverage. The existing static analysis based approaches (*e.g.*, PScout, Axplorer, and Arcade) have better coverage but may lead to imprecise results because of improper modeling of the complicated Android communication mechanisms. PSGen extracts protection mapping for Android NDK (*i.e.*, both protected APIs and permission checks are in the Native code), which has a different scope to our approach (*i.e.*, the protected APIs are in the Java framework, while the permission checks are in the Native code).\n\nSpecifically, existing works only analyzed the Java API framework in the *Android API Framework*, but overlooked the *C/C++ Native Library* that consists of core Android system components and services (*e.g.*, Camera service, Sensor service). For example, the public method openCamera() in CameraManager.java class implements its permission check (“android.permission.CAMERA”) in the native library CameraService.cpp. Missing native library analysis will mistakenly conclude that the API openCamera() does not require any permissions (one example is detailed in Section 2). While the API-permission protection mapping contributes to identifying security vulnerabilities in Android apps, such as permission *over-privilege* \\[17\\] (*i.e.*, an app requests additional permissions that are not required), the imprecise mapping will lead to false results on detecting such vulnerabilities. Taking the aforementioned case as an example, an app invokes the API openCamera() will need to request the corresponding permission android.permission.CAMERA; however, existing works that do not analyze the native libraries will identify it as a permission overprivilege case, and henceforce, a false positive. Static analysis is widely used in code analysis due to its fast speed and high code coverage, especially in the field of Android security analysis \\[11, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 32, 38\\]. There are also many works on vulnerability identification of Android operation systems \\[10, 15, 16, 23, 25, 28–30, 33, 35\\]. In this research, to address the shortcomings of the existing works, we leverage the cross-language analysis on the overall Android system, including both the *Java API Framework* and the *C/C++ Native Libraries*. To this end, we analyze the cross-language communication mechanisms on five Android Open Source Projects (AOSP) and summarize two communication models to facilitate the cross-language analysis. We develop a prototype system, NatiDroid, and generate Native-triggered (*i.e.*, an Android API whose permission check is implemented in the native library) API-permission mappings in AOSP versions 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, and 10.0, which were chosen to benchmark against prior works \\[9, 13\\] (see detailed discussion in Section 5). In addition to the mappings generated by previous works, Axplorer and Arcade (2,115 and 1,585, respectively, in AOSP 7.0), NatiDroid can successfully discover 449 mappings that are not covered previously. \n\nNote that while most Android APIs are Java methods, fewer of them are C/C++ methods. Nevertheless, these native methods play indispensable roles in the Android system, such as interacting with the hardware layer. We further use the new mappings to detect permission over-privilege vulnerabilities on a large dataset containing more than 11,000 Android apps, including system apps from custom Android ROMs and third-party apps from the Google Play. We identify the worst-case scenario, where approximately 71% apps with permission over-privilege detected by Axplorer and Arcade are false positives. In summary, we make the following contributions:\n\n• We design and implement a prototype system, NatiDroid, to\n\nfacilitate cross-language control-flow analysis on the Android\n\nframework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the *first* work\n\nto enable cross-language analysis on the Android framework.\n\nBy incorporating NatiDroid with existing Java-side permission\n\nmappings (*e.g.*, Axplorer or Arcade), we obtain a complete per\u0002\n\nmission mapping that covers the entire Android system. We make\n\nour system and results publicly available to benefit researchers\n\nand practitioners.1\n\n• We apply NatiDroid to extract the permission-API protection mappings from the native libraries on four AOSP versions (7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, and 10.0). We show that 12 permissions, including 8 signature and 2 dangerous permissions, are determined to be enforced in native libraries, which are not covered by two state of-the-practice benchmarks, Axplorer and Arcade.\n\n• We analyze Android apps for permission over-privilege. Our results show that NatiDroid is effective in identifying vulnerable Android apps. We have identified approximately 71% false positives in terms of the number of the apps with at least one permission over-privileged. \n\nWe hope that the proposed system, NatiDroid in this paper could bridge the gap between Java- and Native-sides analysis (see Figure 1), rendering the static analysis of the overall Android framework to be complete and accurate.\n\n2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION\n\nThis section provides background information on how Android OS operates and explains the limitations of the existing static API protection mapping generation techniques that motivate our work. Android framework. Android framework consists of the *Java API Framework* layer and *C/C++ Native Library* layer (*i.e.*, the second and the third layers from the top in Figure 1). The *Java API Framework* layer offers Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) written in the Java language for Android app developers to access Android features and functionalities. The Java framework access the device hardware capabilities, such as the camera and sensors, via the *C/C++ Native Library* layer. When a Java framework API (*e.g.*, the Camera Manager in Figure 1) invokes a call to access device hardware, the Android system loads corresponding library module (*e.g.*, the Camera Service) for that hardware component.\n\nAndroid permission model. When an app needs to use any of the protected features of an Android device (*e.g.*, accessing the camera, sending an SMS, making a phone call), it must obtain the appropriate permission(s) from the user. When an Android API is called, the Android framework checks whether it is protected by any permission. Most of such permission checks are defined in the *Java API Framework* layer in the Android system, while there are yet a number of them defined in the *C/C++ Native Library* layer. \n\nExisting works \\[9, 12, 13\\] leverage static analysis on the *Java API Framework* layer of the Android framework to extract the mapping between APIs and corresponding permission checks. Ignoring the invocation of native libraries miss the permission checks in the native libraries, leading to incomplete mapping results.\n\n![Figure 2: Motivation example derived from a real-world Android app vStudio.Android.Camera360. The code is simplified for better illustration.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RFfRLB5Tk348sNTNuwnGI.png?height=727&width=511)\n\nMotivating example. We further elaborate on our motivation with a real-world example illustrated in Figure 2. The code from lines 1 to 10 is derived from a popular photography app vStudio.Android.Camera360 \\[8\\] on Google Play. The app initialises a CameraManager instance (line 4), and opens the camera instance by invoking openCamera() method (line 8). The invocation chain then traverses along the call path through an Android SDK class CameraManager.java (lines 11 to 18) and a native library CameraService.cpp (lines 19 to 32), and finally triggers a permission check in the native library (line 28). Note that the cameraService.connectDevice() (line 18) communicates with the CameraService::connectDevice() (line 20) in a cross-language way (marked as purple). The security check examines if the method is called by its own process (*i.e.*, cameraservice, hence, no permission is required) or the corresponding permission android.permission.CAMERA is granted. If neither it is called from its own process, nor the android.permission.CAMERA permission is granted, a permission denied error is returned (line 30), which will further prevent openCamera() to be executed. This example implies a protection mapping from the Android API, CameraManager.openCamera(), to itspermission protection check, {android.permission.CAMERA || callingPid == getpid()}.2\n\nUnfortunately, as existing works only analyzed the Java source code in the Android framework, they miss the permission checks implemented in the native libraries. For instance, the mapping of the API CameraManager.openCamera() to the permission android.permission.CAMERA, as shown in the example, does not exist in the state-of-the-practice works, such as PScout \\[12\\], Axplorer \\[13\\], or Arcade \\[9\\]. The incompleteness of the mapping results further introduces false results in detecting security vulnerabilities, such as permission over-privilege \\[17\\] (detailed in Section 4.3)\n\n3 APPROACH\n\nWe propose and implement a prototype system, NatiDroid, to address the cross-language protection mapping problem that has long been overlooked in previous works. Figure 3 illustrates the overall design of NatiDroid. As depicted, NatiDroid contains three modules. The *Pre-processing* module prepares the intermediate artifacts for analyzing the Android framework and native libraries, such as intermediate .jar files (for Java-side analysis) and Clang compile commands (for Native-side analysis). The *Entry-points identification* module summarizes two cross-language communication models used in the Android framework, and identifies the entry-points for both Java- and Native-sides analysis. The *Cross-language Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis* module constructs the cross-language CFG and extracts the permission mapping.\n\nWe propose a complete solution for extracting Native-triggered permission mapping from the Android system. We leverage Soot \\[1\\] and Clang \\[2\\] static analysis frameworks, although our solution is also applicable to other static analysis frameworks. Soot is a popular Java optimization framework for analyzing and visualizing Java and Android apps, which has been widely used in various projects for static analysis \\[12, 18, 19\\]. Clang is a lightweight compiler for C language family. We use Clang to transform C/C++ code to the Abstract syntax tree (AST) \\[3\\]. Additional code for implementing NatiDroid consists of approximately 7kLOC. We detail the design and implementation of each module in the following subsections.\n\n3\\.1 Pre-processing\n\nDue to the complexity and cross-language nature of the Android framework, there is no off-the-shelf tool for static analysis of the Android framework (*i.e.*, *Java API Framework* and *Native Library*) as a whole. NatiDroid leverages the *divide-and-conquer* strategy to facilitate the Java- and Native-sides analysis. However, there are still non-trivial tasks to prepare the AOSP codebase for the static analysis. Hence, in this module, we prepare the intermediate artifacts from the AOSP codebase, which are required to enable the Java- and Native-sides analysis. Note that the pre-processing module includes most engineering works, which is not considered our technical contribution. However, it is essential to facilitate the proposed cross-language analysis.\n\n![\nFigure 3: An overview of NatiDroid system\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4MIJk1yb0zMz2w-UXK5ec.png?height=365&width=1087)\n\nJava-side analysis preparation. NatiDroid’s Java-side analysis takes compiled .jar file as input. However, to maintain the stability of the Android system, some non-SDK class and method bodies are hidden using the @hidden Javadoc tag (*e.g.*, non-SDK Android APIs that may be changed in the future versions without noticing the app developer) during the building of android.jar from source code. The hidden classes and methods only expose the method name, parameters, return values, and minimum set of statements required to handle the invocation, which is not sufficient for constructing a complete CFG. We therefore retain the intermediate output during the compilation, *i.e.*, the intermediate .jar files that have not been combined as android.jar. These intermediate .jar files, such as services.com.intermediates.jar, have the complete class and method information sufficient for facilitating static analysis.\n\nNative-side analysis preparation. Before we build the crosslanguage CFG (cf. Section 3.3), we leverage Clang to transform C/C++ source code to AST. A complete set of Clang compile command is required to enable the static analysis, however, is not provided in Android documentation. Android uses the ninja to build system \\[6\\]. During the compilation process, the .ninja files containing ninja build commands are generated by the compiler.\n\nHowever, the commands obtained from .ninja files consist of file operations and a mixture of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and Clang commands, which are not compatible with the off-the-shelf Clang-based analyzer. We then develop a system (to 500 LOC) to extract and pre-process the required commands from these files. The functions of the system include merging separated ninja commands and replacing the Clang++ commands with Clang commands (*i.e.*, adding C++ headers in Clang command’s parameters).\n\n3\\.2 Entry-Points Identification\n\nRecall that the overall idea of generating a protection mapping is to examine whether the invocation of an API will trigger a permission check in the Android framework (*i.e.*, if there is a permission check node in the CFG starting from the API call). Due to the complexity of the Android framework, building a CFG of the overall framework is neither practical nor efficient. As NatiDroid’s goal is to complement the existing mappings, such as Axplorer and Arcade, by adding the protections whose permission checks are located in the native libraries, we only generate sub-CFGs for the Android APIs that involve cross-language communication. The first step to generate sub-CFGs is to identify the entry-points of the graphs (for both Java- and Native-sides). To this end, we first summarize two cross-language communication mechanisms used by Android.\n\n![\nFigure 4: AIDL communication model. The Java-side caller invokes remote method from Native-side.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TmQrkwSt5j7Io92h32gxu.png?height=218&width=521)\n\nAIDL-based communication model. The Android operating system (OS) is based on Linux but does not inherit the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism of Linux. In Android, resources between processes are not shared. Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) is one of the IPC mechanisms that Android adopted to enable communication for remote invocation, providing crossprocess or even cross-language communication. Figure 4 depicts the workflow of AIDL-based client-service model, where the Java framework works as a client requesting service from the native library. AIDL utilizes a pair of Stub/Proxy classes on Java-side to communicate with native libraries. The Proxy is responsible for sending requests to native service and implementing the remote method which invokes the transact() method and communicates with Native-side, while the Stub class, inheriting the Binder class, transforms service Binder and receives the reply from native service using the method onTransact(). The transact() and on Transact() are synchronous, such that a call to transact() does not return until the target has returned from onTransact().\n\nOn Native-side, it is unnecessary to generate Stub/Proxy pairs, but directly implements the remote method (using the name as same as the remote method on Java-side) to handle the request from Java-side, so that we can always find the receiver on Transact() and the same name remote method as the AIDL sender. Through using pairs of onTransact() and transact() methods as sender and receiver on both sides, the communication between Java- and Native-sides is established. Therefore, cross-language interaction can be detected via matching the use of AIDL on Java- and Nativesides (*e.g.*, the Stub/Proxy pair, the onTransact() methods, and the implementation of the remote methods and the transact() methods). We can then determine the entry-points for static analysis accordingly.\n\n![\nFigure 5: An example of AIDL-based cross-language communication model. The code snippets are simplified for better illustration.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ivh91dZoFAwRzZ-mHpI79.png?height=522&width=485)\n\nAn example of AIDL mechanism is shown in Figure 5, where the method getCameraInfo() uses AIDL to implement the communication between Java and C++. A pair of a sender and a receiver on each side of AIDL (*i.e.*, the client and the service) handles the cross-language communication. The caller (line 3) invokes the method getCameraInfo() which is firstly defined as an interface in line 6 and then implemented in line 14 (the detailed implementation is omitted). In the corresponding native library (lines 16 to 24), the receiver onTransact() handles the request and further invokes the method getCameraInfo() (line 23). The get CameraInfo() method then executes the method implementation and sends the execution result back to the Java-side onTransact() method (line 9), which is further passed back to the caller (line 3). Note that the getCameraInfo() in line 6 and the getCameraInfo() in line 18 are the two interface methods that both invoke the transact() method (omitted) to establish the communication between Java- and Native-sides. The NatiDroid will match the pair of such remote methods and recognize them as a pair of Java entry-point and native entry-point. Note that, for the inner-language AIDL communication on both Java- and Native-sides, NatiDroid generates CFG with a similar approach, except for the identification of entry-points.\n\nJNI-based communication model. Java Native Interface (JNI) provides a cross-language interface between Java and Native code written in C/C++). This enables developers to write native methods to handle situations when an app cannot be written entirely in the Java programming language, *e.g.*, when the standard Java class library does not support the platform-specific features or program library, such as communication with the underlying hardware. In the JNI framework, native functions are implemented in .c or .cpp files. When invoking the function, it passes a JNIEnv pointer, a jobject pointer, and any Java arguments declared by the Java method.\n\n![\nFigure 6: JNI communication model. Java- and Native-sides communicate with JNI.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KNszCFi-zl3ylckTCQkwH.png?height=279&width=508)\n\nFigure 6 shows the JNI-based communication model adopted by Android. Android uses the JNI Dynamic Register to link native methods. Different from the AIDL model, the JNI-based communication starts from a registration process. When Android starts running, the AndroidRuntime class uses the startReg() method to start the registration of JNI methods, which will further invoke all JNI registration functions implemented in the native libraries. \n\nThe registration functions will register native methods with the corresponding Java class specified by an array of JNINativeMethod structures that contains the Java method name, Java method signature, and pointers to the native function. After the registration process, all the JNINativeMethod (on Native-side) is registered and linked to the corresponding Java method in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n\nWe further explain the JNI-based communication mechanism with an example given in Figure 7, which is derived from android_hardware_Radio.cpp in AOSP 8.0. The method register_android_hardware_Radio() (line 13) is called to register the JNI methods for Radio, with the JNI method information provided in line 16. Specifically, the kRadioModuleClassPathName variable (line 5) declares the containing class name of the Java method, and gModuleMethods (line 7) declares the correspondence between the Java method and the C++ function. The variable gModuleMethods is defined to contain groups of the Java method name (line 8), parameter and returned types (lines 9 to 10), and the pointer of C++ method (line 11). All the information will be dynamically registered in JVM during run-time. Finally, the C++ method involved in the crosslanguage communication is declared in line 12, while the involving Java method can be found in the java file RadioModule.java in package android.hardware.radio (lines 2 to 3).\n\n![\nFigure 7: An example of JNI-based cross-language communication. The code snippets are simplified for better illustration.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/czCJ-K5HtSWBYHp6ItYOq.png?height=338&width=494)\n\nAccording to the JNI-based communication mechanism, we extract pairs of entry-points from Java- and Native-sides. Specifically, the JNI methods and the corresponding native methods are vaguely identified by a linear sweep searching of keyword RegisterMethodsOrDie, registerNativeMethods and jniRegister NativeMethods over the .cpp files at first. Then we extract the class path name (*e.g.*, the kRadioModuleClassPathName in Figure 7) and the array of JNINativeMethod structures, from which a pair of entry-points can be located and recognized (*e.g.*, the pair of native_setup() and android_hardware_Radio_setup()).\n\n3\\.3 Cross-Language Protection Mapping Extraction\n\nAfter the entry-points on both Java- and Native-sides are identified, we further extract the protection mappings from AOSPs. In this section, we first introduce how NatiDroid generates CFG from both sides. Based on the CFG, NatiDroid then traverses the crosslanguage Android API call paths and corresponding security checks (*e.g.*, permission checks) to generate the API-permission protection mappings.\n\n*3.3.1 Cross-language CFG Generation.* We elaborate the detailed steps involved in generating cross-language CFGs. After obtaining the entry-point pairs from both Java- and Native-sides (as detailed in Section 3.2), NatiDroid first leverages a forward analysis to generate a CFG on the Native-side from each identified native entry-point. If the native-side CFG does not contain any security checkpoint (*e.g.*, permission check, *UID* check, and *PID* check), we discard the CFG for computational efficiency. Otherwise, NatiDroid further utilizes a backward analysis to build a Java-side CFG starting from the paired Java-side entry-point to an Android API. If the reached Android API is further invoked by other Android APIs, we extend the CFG until the API is not called by any other APIs. The CFGs generated from both sides are then connected with the communication models identified in Section 3.2. We detail the mechanisms unique to Android that require additional work to handle as follows.\n\nHandling the service identifier. The aforementioned AIDL is of ten used to invoke remote methods in service. Before the invocation, the service is usually pointed by passing a string to the getService or checkService method, for example, the string “media.player” in line 19 of Figure 8. When building the call graph, we need to handle such remote invocation and identify which class is the identifier string actually pointed to. These services are registered to the system through an addService method (either on Java-side or Native-side). Therefore, we can automatically collect the corre spondences between these identifiers and service classes from it. First, we scan the Java and C++ files looking for addService meth ods. Then the program confirms whether the method is ServiceManager.addService or defaultServiceManager->addService, separately. Once confirmed, the program extracts a pair of service class and the corresponding identifier from the parameters; for example, the string identifier “media.player” in Figure 8 will be paired with its service class MediaPlayerService.\n\nHandling Android strong pointer. Although the strong pointer defines the type variable, the type is not necessary to be restricted. Therefore, we need additional efforts to get what type the strong pointer actually points to from the context. According to the strong pointer mechanism, when we find that a member function is called, if the object is declared as a strong pointer, the invocation of the member function will be determined automatically. The NatiDroid will first trace the statement where an object is assigned to the strong pointer. If it is assigned through method getService(), the type of the object will be determined by the passed service identifier; otherwise, NatiDroid will determine the type of strong pointer according to the variable type returned by the function.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jI_UIdLyCqoJQUwWcIKYH.png?height=309&width=1077)\n\nHandling member variables. A class member variable is also possibly assigned by a strong pointer. For example, in line 7 of Figure 8, the setAudioSource() method of the mMediaRecorder object is invoked, but from this line of code we cannot determine the type of variable mMediaRecorder so that we cannot determine which setAudioSource() method has been invoked. By looking up in the referenced header file (from line 23), we find that this variable is a member variable of class MediaRecorder. Therefore, to find out the type of this variable, we can search the entire class looking for the assignment or initialization statement. Note that the assignment should be ignored if the assignment releases the pointer, *e.g.*, pointing the variable to a null pointer. In this case, the variable mMediaRecorder is initialized as the return value of createMediaRecorder in the class constructor (line 12). We have explained how to determine the return type of createMediaRecorder in the previous paragraph, handling Android strong pointers. To implement the process automatically, if a variable cannot be tracked in the local scope, NatiDroid will point to the header file to check whether it is a member variable, and thus the tracking scope will be expanded to the entire class.\n\nHandling particular access control. Binder transaction executes with the identity (*i.e.*, PID and UID) of a caller. If a transaction needs to run with callee’s identity, Binder.clearCallingIdentity() can temporarily clear the caller’s identity, so that the callee’s identity will be checked during the transaction. Then the caller’s identity can be restored by Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(). To handle such intervened access control, NatiDroid uses callee’s identity for security control for all methods between the two Binder methods.\n\n*3.3.2 Protection Mapping Extraction.* We present the workflow of extracting the protection mapping of Android APIs. After obtaining the cross-language CFG, we resort to a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy to check if there are call paths between Android APIs in the *Java API Framework* layer and security checks in the *Native Library* layer. For each node in the CFG, if it is a Java node, we will collect all its native children and obtain the security checks defined in its children nodes. If there are more than one checkpoint on the call trace (*e.g.*, an Android API is protected by multiple permissions),\n\nwe concatenate them with *AND* operation. As inspired by Aafer *et al.* \\[9\\], we also include security checks other than permission enforcement, such as UID and PID checks. If there is more than one Android API along the track, we create a mapping entry for each of them (*i.e.*, all Android APIs along the track have the same security check). Finally, each pair of Java API node and its corresponding security check(s) in Native-side will be added into the protection mapping.\n\n4 EVALUATION\n\nThe main contribution of this work, NatiDroid, is to enable the cross-language static analysis of the Android framework. Since there is a number of existing tools \\[4, 37\\] and works \\[9, 13\\] well handling the static analysis of the Java-side of Android framework, NatiDroid specifically focuses on the analysis of the crosslanguage part of the Android framework. In this section, we run experiments to verify the performance of NatiDroid and to answer\n\nthe following research questions:\n\n• RQ1: How effective is NatiDroid in identifying permission enforcement in Native libraries?\n\n• RQ2: How many permission mappings can our tool identify that are not recognized by the state-of-the-practice approaches?\n\n• RQ3: How can our tool contribute to real-world security evaluation?\n\nWe use NatiDroid to extract the API protection mapping for 5 AOSP versions – 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, and 10.0. We obtained the source code from the official AOSP repository \\[7\\]. The experiment ran on a Linux server with Intel (R) Core (TM) i9-9920X CPU @ 3.50GHz and 128 GB RAM.\n\n4\\.1 RQ1: The Performance of NatiDroid\n\nWe present the statics of Permission-API protection mapping extracted from the Native libraries in Table 1 (columns 1 to 6). In each of AOSP 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, and 8.1, our tool identified more than 440 APIs whose permission enforcement take place in the Native code, while in AOSP 10.0, NatiDroid detected 282 APIs containing permission enforcement on the Native side. In Table 2, we list the permissions that have permission checks in native libraries, including 2 *dangerous* permissions, 8 *signature* permissions, and 2 *normal* permissions. *Signature* permissions are only granted if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission. *Normal* permissions refer to the permissions with minimal risk to the system and the users’ private data. *Dangerous* permissions are those higher-risk permissions that would give access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the users.\n\nDue to the lack of ground truth for the permission protection mappings, it is difficult to evaluate the overall accuracy of the extracted mappings. We therefore resort to a manual process to examine the correctness of our mappings. To this end, we manually inspect the involved source code in the AOSP codebase to confirm if the APIs will go through the corresponding security check(s) and if the condition(s) in the security check(s) is(are) consistent with the condition(s) in the mappings. we randomly selected 20% of the total mappings (*i.e.*, 421 mappings) for manual inspection and found no missing or redundant protection conditions in our mappings.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dvda026brlcuhrSnWkMBX.png?height=308&width=506)\n\nWe further looked into the results on the affected API in each AOSP. In AOSP 10.0, the number of affected APIs decreased significantly, compared to other versions (282 in AOSP 10.0 *vs.* 456*.*5 ± 7*.*5 in AOSP 7.1 to 8.1). Through the manual code review, we found that two *signature* permissions, ACCESS_DRM_CERTIFICATES and CONTROL_WIFI_DISPLAY, have been removed in AOSP 10.0. At the same time, the code related to the audio service was refactored and simplified, which greatly reduced the number of exposed methods.\n\nAnswer to RQ1. NatiDroid identified more than 440 APIs that are protected by permission enforcement in the Native code in AOSP 7.1-8.1, and 282 APIs in AOSP 10.0, which are verified by manual inspection (20% sampling).\n\n4\\.2 RQ2: Comparison with other mappings\n\nState-of-the-art works use static and dynamic analysis approaches to extract the API-permission protection mapping from the Android framework. For instance, Axplorer \\[13\\] and Arcade \\[9\\] use static methods to retrieve the protection mapping. Dynamo \\[14\\], on the other hand, extracts the mapping by leveraging dynamic analysis.\n\nThis RQ compares our results with the mappings derived from these approaches. Unfortunately, the mapping from Dynamo lacks method signature information (*e.g.*, class name, return type, and parameter list), which is required to identify a method (e.g., there could be methods with identical names in different classes). We cannot accurately compare our mapping with Dynamo’s mapping.\n\nTherefore, in this RQ, we compare our work with Axplorer and Arcade. The mappings of Axplorer and Arcade are derived from their public repositories3 Note that since both works only released their mapping results (for AOSP version 7.1 and under) in lieu of the tools, we are unable to obtain the mappings on AOSP 8.0, 8.1, and 10.0. Table 1 presents the comparison of permission-API protection mappings on the five AOSP versions. Unsurprisingly, sinceNatiDroid only focuses on the permission checks in the Android Native libraries, while Axplorer and Arcade only work on the Android Java framework, there is no overlap between NatiDroid and the two works, respectively. As shown in the first two columns of Table 1, the number of newly identified permissions that are missed in previous works ranges from 9 to 12 in the five AOSP versions. There are 282 to 464 Android APIs associated with these permissions (*i.e.*, invoking these APIs requires the corresponding permissions to be granted), counting up to approximate 30% of the mappings reported in the previous study, which are overlooked in the previous work that only analyzed the Java-side of the Android framework. Table 1 reports the breakdown of the mappings based on the permission protection levels. The mapping results contain the permissions in *signature*, *dangerous*, and *normal* levels. Missing these mappings, especially the ones for the dangerous permissions, will lead to false results in detecting security issues of Android apps, such as permission over-privilege (detailed in Section 4.3). Thus, the main security and privacy threats to the majority of Android apps (*i.e.*, thirdparty apps, which usually have no access to *signature* permissions) are caused by inaccurate mapping of *dangerous* permissions. It is therefore worth highlighting that NatiDroid has identified the mappings for two additional dangerous permissions CAMERA and RECORD_AUDIO, which are closely related to user’s privacy.\n\nAnswer to RQ2. NatiDroid is able to identify 2 dangerous permission, 8 signature permissions, and 2 normal permissions that previous works have missed. Approximate 30% of the mappings reported in the previous study are related to these permissions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OaS_Jk63wgyadrvD3U7kU.png?height=234&width=443)\n\n4\\.3 RQ3: Applications of Protection Mappings\n\nThe protection mappings can be leveraged to detect security issues of Android apps, such as *permission over-privilege*. In this subsection, we evaluate the effectiveness of our extracted mappings in identifying the security vulnerabilities.\n\nWe include two categories of Android apps in our experiments: the custom ROM apps that are pre-installed on the devices, such as *Camera* and *Calendar*, as well as the third-party apps that users can download from official or alternative app stores (*e.g.*, social networking apps, banking apps). The experimental dataset contains 1,035 custom ROM apps extracted from five Android custom ROMs of four vendors (*i.e.*, Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Xiaomi) and 10,000 third-party apps randomly downloaded from the Google Play store.\n\nTable 3 shows an overview of the dataset in use. We use the permission protection mappings extracted from AOSP to detect security vulnerabilities in both the custom ROM apps and third-party apps. The AOSP mapping may miss some vendorcustomized permissions (*e.g.*, huawei.permission.SET_SMSC_ADDRESS), which may be used in the custom ROM apps. Nevertheless, we argue that using the AOSP mapping may miss some vulnerabilities caused by the misuse of vendor-customized permissions but will not affect the results corresponding to the official permissions, serving as the main scope of our study.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s8zFot94vQXy6OXZDzgEo.png?height=252&width=1075)\n\nPermission Over-privilege Detection. Android app developers access Android framework functionalities by invoking Android APIs. Some APIs have access to sensitive information, such as reading the contact list, are protected by permissions. Developers need to request such permissions from the Android system before accessing the sensitive resources. Specifically, a list of required permissions need to be declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file, and the corresponding permissions protected APIs are to be invoked in the app’s implementation. \n\n![\nFigure 9: False-positive over-privileged permissions in previous works detected by NatiDroid.\n\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vMt5rABrFSO4OWD0EQy_m.png?height=255&width=470)\n\nAccording to the Android developers’ documentation \\[5\\], app developers should request a minimum set of permissions required to complete the app’s functionality, as introducing additional permissions will increase the risk of privacy leak. However, developers usually (either intentionally or unintentionally) request permissions that are not related to the functionalities actually implemented in the app, and hence, not necessary \\[17\\]. To detect apps with the permission over-privilege issue, we extract the reachable APIs of the app (with a 30-min timeout), and retrieve its protection conditions (*e.g.*, permission, *UID*, *PID*) according to the mappings. For instance, when invoking an Android API, it may check the *UID* (*e.g.*, uid == AID_SYSTEM checks if the app has system privilege) and the *PID* (*e.g.*, callingPid == getpid() examines if the method is called by its own process) along with permission enforcement. While the *UID* can be retrieved statically, the *PID* has to be determined at run-time, thereby cannot be obtained through static analysis. Nevertheless, the apps included in the experiment are custom ROM apps and third-party apps, which cannot possess *PID* of Android system services. Therefore, it is safe to assume that callingPid == getpid() will always return false in our tested apps. Finally, if the app declares permission (in the AndroidManifest.xml file) that is not required (*i.e.*, no APIs associated with the permissions found in the app), we flag it as an over-privilege case. Results. Table 4 presents the over-privilege detection results. \n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our mappings in pinpointing the permission over-privilege issue, we compare previous works’ results with our results. Recall that NatiDroid only extracts protection mappings from the Native libraries, in our results (*i.e.*, *Nati + Ar* and *Nati + Ax*), the Java-side mappings are derived from Arcade and Axplorer. We identify 95.8% and 95.5% apps with a permission over-privilege issue using Arcade’s and Axplorer’s mappings, respectively. Among their results, we identify that 66.6% and 54.2% apps (in Arcade’s and Axplorer’s results, respectively) contain false-positive results caused by missing Native-triggered permission mappings. Specifically, as shown in the last four columns of Table 4, there are 8,063 and 357 permissions that are erroneously identified as over-privilege by Axplorer in 71.5% third-party apps and 22.2% custom ROM apps, respectively; for Axplorer, 7,894 permissions in 71.38% third-party apps and 309 permissions in 21.02% custom ROM apps are found to be false-positive. Interestingly, both Arcade and Axplorer report that a significantly high proportion of apps (approximately 96%) suffer from a permission over-privilege issue. We therefore take an in-depth look into their detection results and observe that the majority of their false positives are caused by missing native triggered INTERNET permission mappings. As illustrated in Figure 9, we further present the breakdown of permissions that cause the false positive results in the comparing methods. \n\nSpecifically, missing INTERNET permission mappings leads to 6,661 and 6,660 false positives in Arcade’s and Axplorer’s results. Other missing permission mappings that contribute to the false positives include RECORD_AUDIO (623 false positives in both Arcade and Axplorer), MODIFY_AUDIO_- SETTINGS (424 and 256 false positives in Arcade and Axplorer, respectively), and CAMERA (355 false positives in both Arcade and Axplorer).\n\nManual inspection. Due to the lack of ground truth, we manually inspect if the over-privileged permissions detected are indeed unneeded by the containing apps. The first two authors of this paper and three security researchers are involved in the manual inspection. The result is determined via majority voting. For each app, we decompile the *APK* file and locate the relevant APIs. Then, we manually check the app’s context and determine whether the invocation of the APIs meet the conditions in the protection mappings. As this process involves immense manual efforts, it cannot scale to cover a large number of apps. Hence, we manually verified 100 randomly selected apps. Our manual analysis indicates that most of the cases are true positives (95%). The remaining five apps contain implicit parameters passed to the APIs to be examined,which cannot be precisely inferred via static analysis. Nevertheless, we resort to a dynamic approach to verify the remaining five apps. Specifically, we remove the permissions in question from the AndroidManifest.xml file and repackage the app. Then, we manually test the app on an emulator to confirm if the app crashes or the corresponding functions are disabled. As a result, the removal of the permissions in question has no impact on the apps, suggesting that these permissions are indeed unneeded.\n\nAnswer to RQ3. Our tool identified that more than half of the over-privilege results from state-of-the-practice tools are false-positives, which is caused by missing Native-triggered permission mappings.\n\n5 THREATS TO VALIDITY Android versions. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate cross-language static analysis of the Android framework andbuild a prototype system, NatiDroid, to extract API-permission mapping from the Android operating system. To compare with the state-of-the-practice works Axplorer and Arcade, which are close sourced and only generated the mappings up to Android 7.1, in our experiment, we extract the mappings from the latest versions they have (i.e., 7.0 and 7.1) and three newer versions (i.e., 8.0, 8.1 and 10.0). Nevertheless, the proposed solution can apply to any Android version, with further engineering works to be done in the pre-processing module. Custom ROMs. Android smartphones such as Samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi, are shipped with vendor-customized Android systems (i.e., custom ROMs) rather than the AOSP. Unfortunately, these custom ROMs are not open-source. The proposed solution takes the source code as input; therefore, it cannot extract permission mappings from these close sourced custom ROMs. However, smartphone vendors can use our solution to analyze their customized Android versions based on their source code. Nevertheless, to maintain the compatibility of running third-party apps, such custom ROMs are not likely to modify the normal and dangerous level permission specifications of AOSP that third-party apps can access, but rather add a few signature level permissions for their own system apps. Therefore, the results derived from AOSP will not affect the security analysis of third-party apps, which are the majority in the Android ecosystem. On the other hand, with NatiDroid, thirdparty vendors can perform an inner security analysis on custom ROM source code, determine whether there are errors in the implementation of permission mappings, and further detect permission over-privilege before releasing an app. Static analysis. When detecting over-privilege issues in Android apps, we may suffer from the intrinsic vulnerability of static code analysis when encountering code obfuscation and reflection, which may lead to the unsoundness of our results. When building the apps’ call graph, our method may yield unsound results because it may miss the context and the parameters that can only be obtained at run-time. For example, the API android.media.MediaPlayer: void setDataSource requires the Internet permission when the data source is online media. The source is not always a static string so that it may be assigned at run-time. Nevertheless, these challenges are regarded as well known and non-trivial issues to overcome in the research community \\[34\\]. \n\n6 RELATED WORK \n\nChaoran citation, surname not first name Android API protection mapping. Stowaway \\[17\\] initially explored and analyzed the Android permission specification. \n\nThey extracted API mappings based on the feedback directed fuzz testing, and dynamically recorded the permission checks of APIs. The mappings they extracted are accurate, but the code coverage is limited. To address the limitations of low code coverage, PScout \\[12\\] uses static analysis to extract the API protection mapping. However, they did not consider the context of the API invocation, and thus may produce false positive mappings. Axplorer \\[13\\] leverages more accurate static analysis on the SDK and Android framework, and generates more precise permission specifications. Arcade \\[9\\] conducted a similar static analysis, with additional attention paid to extract other security mechanisms, such as UID and PID checks. While these works only analyzed the Java-side of the Android, none of the works has looked into the native libraries within the Android framework. In order to overcome the limitations of static analysis, Dynamo \\[14\\] uses dynamic analysis, aiming to obtain more accurate mapping. PSGen \\[39\\] conducts an analysis permission specification for Android NDK (i.e., both protected APIs and permission checks are in the Native code), which has a different scope to our approach (i.e., protected APIs are in the Java framework, while the permission checks are in the Native code). \n\nOur work fills the research gap by analyzing the native libraries and their communications with the Java framework to produce more comprehensive permission protection mappings. Cross-language analysis on Android. Chaoran NCScope: hardwareassisted analyzer for native code in Android apps A plethora of works have proposed to solve the analysis of cross-language code. George et al. \\[20\\] scanned the binary libraries and cross-referenced the information to search the call-backs from Native code to Java. Their work focuses on the JNI mechanism alone. However, the Android framework provides other IPC mechanisms, such as AIDL, which are not considered. Fengguo et al. \\[38\\] proposed a static analysis framework that focuses on performing cross-language modeling and generating call graphs for the analyzed apps. Jucify \\[36\\] conducts a static analysis approach which extends the app analysis to native codes. Nevertheless, these works are only applicable to Android apps, which are far less complicated than the Android framework we analyzed. In addition, our cross-language analysis handles various Android IPC mechanisms such as JNI and AIDL.\n\n7 CONCLUSION \n\nWe proposed a novel approach, NatiDroid, to facilitate the crosslanguage analysis of the Android framework. NatiDroid identifies the entry-point pairs of both Java- and Native-sides of the Android framework, where both sides are communicated through JNI and AIDL based mechanisms, so NatiDroid builds the cross-language CFG on the overall Android framework (Java + Native code). Based on the cross-language CFG, we extracted Native-triggered permission specifications and created the protection mappings in the native code to complement existing Java-based mappings. We further applied our new mappings to detect permission over-privilege vulnerabilities in a large dataset consisting of more than 11,000 Android apps. We finally show that using the mapping derived by NatiDroid can identify a significant number of false results existing in the state of the art, such as Axplorer and Arcade.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\\[1\\] 1999.

In July last year, I registered the Ens domain name--metamess.eth, which is the 0x address of the burned POAPs. At that time, Ens had not issued token yet. Of course, I didn’t know it would issue token. I started collecting POAP in May last year, which was earlier than registering the Ens domain name. I think it\\`s cool to enter the blockchain world and have your own domain name. So, like the Ens domain name, POAP's collection is purely based on love for it. I remember that the first POAP was the Metazoo POAP on Decentraland, and knowing POAP also started from here. It deepened my understanding of the blockchain:  the non-tamperable on-chain credentials can also be designed as badges for event participation certificates as souvenirs, What a great thing that is! From then on, I got addicted to it and started the journey of collecting POAPs.\n\nSince then, I took time every day to see where there are POAPs in the DCL scene, such as DG Casino, Metazoo, Tensaistudio, etc. They often hold events and there are POAPs to claim.Later, I found that can create event on <https://poap.xyz> and apply for badges to distribute to event participants. From the end of June to the beginning of July 2021, I created my first event in DCL and applied for the first POAP. This event is to celebrate\"100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China\",it is a major event in our country. I want to leave a mark on the blockchain for this event. I established my own metaverse exhibition in DCL. At that time, I applied for 100 POAPs. This event was very popular at the time. , everyone was very interested in the event and the POAP I designed.I was very surprised that their love is so crazy, they want to spend money to buy the POAP I designed, and my answer is: this is only for event vouchers and commemorations, not for commercial purposes! This first event was very successful.which inspired me a lot. Since then, I have also created several events at <https://poap.xyz>. The following is a list of these events:\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3353](https://poap.gallery/event/3353)\n\n![The 100th Anniversary of the Founding of The Communist Party of China](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V2g4CdB_wITcT6QGR_Dt9.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3555](https://poap.gallery/event/3555)\n\n![                  『☭』庆祝中国共产党成立100周年-- DCL线上纪念活动 01-Jul-2021                                         I remember that after applying for this POAP, Mr worthalter told me that I must use English next time, otherwise I will not pass it. Your regulations have not stated that you must use English! I've also seen a lot of POAPs in other languages ​​so far!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bAa7fbkdlGYfiCGDM25aN.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3716](https://poap.gallery/event/3716)\n\n![Gitman](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J_IpzY0BBI7OBtXusD46_.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/5517](https://poap.gallery/event/5517)\n\n![Celebration for 1000 POAPs collection 11-Aug-2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0JmuPnMEZZgEaChJRrlzE.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/7590](https://poap.gallery/event/7590)\n\n![MetaMess Twitter followers 1K 15-Sep-2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o5oQaNmTYHLjxFLYD_qna.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![Someone said to buy the POAP I designed](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ydxjoMJe7J-iQMzLw9Io3.png?height=623&width=563)\n\nAlong with it, day after day, I madly collect POAPs, it has become a part of my life, and I am keen to collect it. In the end, it has affected my work and life, and I am still so fascinated by it. One day, a friend told me that I was ranked\nNo. 1 in the number of POAPs on a leaderboard website. At that time, my number was 1000. I was very surprised about it. I don't know who built a special one for this--The ranking list of the number of POAPs, followed by many people sprinting for the ranking, many people joined the POAP collection madly, and therefore, an event I created is about my POAP number exceeded 1000, for I designed a badge that reached 1000 poaps, and also applied for 1000 POAP Claim links to distribute those POAPs to friends who participated in the event. I should be the first person to reach 1000 POAPs. At the same time, the number of POAP Wallets also started. The geometric growth, I vaguely remember that it was 200,000 addresses, and now it is 900,000 addresses. My POAPs ranked No. 1 for a long time in 2021. Therefore, in the Chinese community, many POAP collectors know the name MetaMess.\n\n![As of July 19, 2022, my number of POAPs is 3847, ranking 8th](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/unYke56GCLtixZ8lVD2Sv.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\nAs time comes to October 2021, this was a turning point for me to POAP. Mr worthalter--the CEO of POAP, sent an email to the publisher who created the event with his own mailbox. The issuer will distribute an Early issuers poap. At that time, I was very happy to receive this email from the CEO himself, but a few days later, some friends have received the second email with the Poap Claim Link, but I still hadn't received it, and then I started to get confused. Why some people who only created one event received this it, and some who only created events but failed to apply also claimed this poap, and then I sent an email to Mr worthalter, It's also didn\\`t receive his reply. Next day, I DM him a message on Discord, and immediately blocked me. I was baffled by this. Finally, I went to POAP's Discord public channel general, just typed “Hi”, as soon as I sent it, I was kicked from POAP Discord. Now, I feel very angry and frustrated at the moment, why am I the person who would like to participated in the building of the POAP, was treated so unfairly.Of course it's not just me who has been kicked, as far as I know, those who speak differently to you will be removed from the POAP community. Later, I can only found the official POAP mod or staff to help me with this matter, but they also don't know why didn't distribute this early issuer poap to me and didn't respond at the end.  Since then, I have been disappointed with POAP.\n\n![A--Screenshot of an email Mr worthalter sent me in Oct 13, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5fUwZEVi3CuN5HqweZ4X1.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![B--Screenshot of my email to Mr worthalter，but no response Oct 14, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I7nXX5zwql8_UHGkACgOm.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![ C--I DM Mr worthalter and got blocked in Oct 15, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qTxmtVqX4HeAFKVsADUD8.png?height=969&width=1920)\n\nAccording to the official statement at that time, it was said that you must have this Early issuers poap in order to create an event. For this reason, in November 2021, I used another account address to spend 518 xdai to bought an Early issuer poap on the [Epor.io](http://Epor.io) market，But at that moment I no longer have the idea of ​​creating POAP events. In addition, in December, there was a big crash in the cryptocurrency market, and the digital currency I bought also suffered serious losses. When the market was at its worst this year, I sold my all currency assets that lost a lot of money， However, on July 8, 2022, the [Epor.io](http://Epor.io) website that POAP official supported also stole my Early issuers poap because of a loophole, and was sold by the thieves, and they did not roll it back for me. Because of this, I began to slow down the pace of collecting POAPs. At the end of last year, the number of POAPs reached 3,500 (starting from the end of April 2021), and as of July 2022, the total number of POAPs is 3847 POAPs, which means that I only collected 347 POAPs in the 7 months of 2022. Because of the above events, I have already only collect POAP occasionally, and now, on the rank leaderboard, the people above me are all above 4700+,They were just behind me last year!\n\nNow, just a few days ago, you burned all the 3847 POAPs in my address and threw them to the black hole address, and my whole person collapsed, because those POAPs were collected by me day and night, reversing my work and rest time. Go to DCL to play games, go to various Discord project parties to listen to AMA meetings, spend hundreds of days in Coingecko dapp to click and sign in to get 4000 points and spend them in exchange for Coingecko's POAPs, purchased in the exchange market, there are also many POAPs that may launch airdrops, such as METAMASK, SSV,The Graph,etc. POAP for my donation to the [Gitcoin.io](http://Gitcoin.io) Grant-initiated project--(I also made two donations to POAP from G11 and G12 last year, totaling $15.) and more I created POAPs for my own events, and so on. Every POAP has a story about me and them. every POAP is unique. they have been bound to my soul like a body, but now they are being torn apart and strangled at will.Those days and nights, sleepless for collect POAPs. My health was also damaged because of this, and I went to the hospital because of chest pains.Can you understand the bitterness? Now all POAPs have been burned by your merciless fire! Is it just so ruthless, unreasonable, rude, and doing things so ridiculous? You think that this is an abnormal frequency, you discriminate against the Chinese, and you may have difficulty understanding how diligent the Chinese are! I can tell you that China's rising is the result of our sacrifice of sleep time, time with our family, and our own health in exchange for it!\n\n![All POAPs of my address have been burned in July 19, 2022 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAQGLXiYR6tEEdV94aAe7.jpg?height=1624&width=750)\n\n \n And those addresses that have more than a dozen or dozens of POAPs with the same event, why don't you destroy them, those trading website you support have loopholes and thus steal our POAPs, and tens of thousands of POAPs were stolen by hackers, and did not respond to this, issued no warnings and technical countermeasures to the hackers! No penalty for thieves' addresses! No response to losses caused by [Epor.io](http://Epor.io), which you support! The absurd accidents keep happening, and you just blindly evade responsibility and shirk responsibility! And for those of us who are defenseless, give our time, money and hard work, and love your POAP collectors, to be unreasonable, rude, and ruthless, there is no notification from beginning to end, no reasonable explanation, no logical procedure, no Compliant rules and regulations, just unreasonably burn down the POAPs that I used to be crazy about and love, this is like a fatal shot! What is the difference between this and the current shootings in the United States that are shooting and killing innocent civilians! You don't certify the contributions of our collectors, nor do you improve the technology to prevent hackers from stealing, but you shamelessly named farmers for POAP collectors and put black hands on our necks,What are your so-called criteria for judging illegal operations? So far there is no standard! But what you have done to us？we Chinese POAP collectors can debate with you!\n\nYou manage a decentralized business in a centralized and abusive way, get out of the way, web3 does not welcome you!\n\nYou are the disgrace of the blockchain, the dictator, the devil, your actions go against the spirit of blockchain！\n\nYou are indiscriminate, disregarding people's feelings, abusing power, acting recklessly, and destroying humanity!\n\nYou are not qualified to reshape the world in the blockchain world! Shame on the blockchain!!!\n\nGive back my POAPs and give us justice!Verifiable on-chain! In Blockchain we trust!\n\nWe love POAP, but hate dictators!!!\n\n![I also made two donations to POAP from G11 and G12 last year, totaling $15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ly8K3dY4lVt1i-0E7tey3.png?height=842&width=1128)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658549760, "digest": "ELXDJoX5IL-ytiD_DW43Obbk5KekpWK4zD6mY3JMPCg", "contributor": "0x49087eb6f9529EB02a508fB820D7b4d0b52E4881"}
{"id": "xy2doxAaRTrwovmIPBl8Rskmp-NMTce3Rt58D6LSr-k", "title": "ETH合并前相关赛道投资机会", "body": "**1、关于此次合并的确定性**\n\n首先是合并的确定性相对来说还是比较高的，两个测试网虽然都出现不同程度的bug，不过依旧是有解决的方案，包括开发者的言论以及时间点定在了难度炸弹爆炸之前，在难度炸弹不会再度推迟的情况下合并9.19合并似乎是板上钉钉的。\n\n市场也在炒作合并的预期，信标链质押赛道的ldo、rpl、ssv，layer2赛道的op、polychain、lrc，跨链相关的hop，算力迁移的etc。\n\n不过确定性最大的还是以太坊，本来市场上就是在炒作预期，合并的事件也是充满了不确定性，因此相关赛道相对以太坊来说可能并不会出现过多的alpha收益，当然预期和实际的落地还是有区别的，以太坊减产后的叙事面（通缩+赋息资产）和资金面（加密史上最大的供应端缩减）都能给予市场持续的正反馈。\n\n**以下的分析与其说是投资机会，不如说是风险提示。**\n\n**2、质押赛道相关机会**\n\n关于质押赛道，该赛道是同合并最密切相关的，龙头就是ldo，当前价格在1.6附近，再涨一倍市值就能比肩defi的龙头标的，从性价比的角度来看合并之前可能投资机会并不是很多，虽然机构的成本在0.5附近；\n\n![ldo市场份额](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dIebMw8dMltfe3olxvVTE.png?height=974&width=1230)\n\n当然合并之后还是持续看好lido的，一方面，信标链质押赛道和defi有一个很大的不同，即内部的收益率不会受限于TVL的增长，defi板块的某个标的锁仓量会随着内部tvl的增长降低apr，将导致资金向其他可替代标的溢出，而信标链质押赛道则不同，平台内部锁仓量的增长并不是导致收益率降低的原因，某个质押平台的收益率是和整体信标链质押总tvl相关，因此lido随着资金量的增长并不会因为apr的降低导致资金的溢出，故相关赛道中的rpl上线至今也没有蚕食lido过多的份额。\n\n另一方面真正合并之后信标链的质押收益率会出现将近翻倍的增长，这足以超越主流竞争公链的年华收益率以及defi中的eth质押收益率，并且steth的设计也能够释放质押的流动性并赚取收益，在合并之后可能会出现defi+主流公链资金流向ldo的可能性，因此lido有很大的可能性将锁仓量做到defi领域中的第一。不过合并之前还是保持谨慎。\n\nSsv，号称第三方质押池和节点运营商之间的防火墙，和lido没有本质上的竞争关系，反而是合作关系。总体上就是提高第三方质押池（lido）对接的节点运营商的安全性，另外通过分散私钥的技术减少掉线后罚没质押以太坊的风险。但是现在主网还没有上线，因此合并后也会在质押赛道中分一杯羹。\n\n![SSV network](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xof3wiWHDGfWbG0VOnqT7.png?height=830&width=1256)\n\n**3、扩容赛道相关**\n\n关于layer2扩容赛道，pos完成之后，对二层网络来说算是利好，之后以太坊开发组主要会着手于包括对可扩展性的改进，例如 Danksharding、Proto-danksharding 和通过 EIP-4488 降低第 2 层调用数据成本，包括后续也会上线其他的几个Eip以增强Layer2对以太坊数据层的可用性。但是这些都是在合并完成的基础上才会推进，本次合并本来就是在炒作预期，而对二层实质性的利好属于预期中的预期，因此和本次合并的相关性并不是非常高，炒作空间有限。\n\n![layer2相关](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SsYSxIGv-uBR_GEk9n6YS.png?height=422&width=1248)\n\n**4、算力迁移赛道相关**\n\n关于算力迁移赛道，可能并不会有很多的投资机会。以太坊当前矿机主要是分为两种，10-20% 的矿工是基于 ASIC，剩下的是GPU矿机。大部分GPU矿场会转型，为视频流应用程序构建基础架构、2D 和 3D 对象的渲染以及云服务器，etc、rvn、erg等也是可以作为pow挖矿的选择。合并后，etc以太坊经典是唯一可以使用以太坊 ASIC 矿机挖掘的其他 PoW 加密货币，只有etc的哈希算法与 ETH 兼容。\n\n![GPU挖矿份额](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XBn05DmQlhQXDyC2b0IQ7.png?height=686&width=1220)\n\n可见，从矿工的角度来说pow之间的算力迁移并不是刚需，还有很多选择去维持一定的收益率，并且就算算力迁移发生，一方面，大量矿工涌入将大幅提高这个代币的挖矿难度，从而导致挖矿奖励降低，最终结果是大多数矿工无法盈利。同时，从生态层、网络使用率可能不足以支持价格的长时间高位。\n\n综上，合并之前炒作预期确定性最大的还是以太坊，而相关赛道的投资机会还是比较局限的，**相对以太坊可能并不会有过多的alpha收益**；还是回归标题，**本次探讨的是合并之前相关的投资机会**，合并之后会有什么进展还需要追踪。\n\n**欢迎交流探讨\\~**\n\n**欢迎加入@7up DAO**\n\n[https://twitter.com/cheng_shutong](https://twitter.com/cheng_shutong)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658549918, "digest": "t6u4ve87XMkH6kzhRa-u6IQ7qfC5onK_R4XWUqfqtSk", "contributor": "0xa1C5062926FeF0A7F7CfBf6BCf5b9b8d232b0cd8"}

But there is a whiff of desperation here, of trying to latch onto the TikTok horse as it bolts away, taking all of Instagram’s popularity with it.\n\nToday, Meta has [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/new-ways-to-create-instagram-reels-remix/) that virtually all video uploads will now become Reels, whether you want them to or not, while it’s also added a range of new creative tools for Reels as it doubles, and triples down on the short video format.\n\nThe main change is in bringing all video clips into the Reels feed.\n\n*As explained by [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/new-ways-to-create-instagram-reels-remix/):*\n\n* [Access now➔](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsvEvSvgDD3rquWt0mqInH4askEo_jfjFWRb0dINDSG26Yf0J_L-DawX8GmiTD2cZYfYl0YWRZ3mcY9cgDpVzq_WM0rnjoOUo6kNGePx3Zg46CjV2MA-AgRsJ6rK74magfQHCi6U8nOHt7KY_Q_8BI7kZGfADWkRRdiVqFlu0k8_O3vKB5G50VjM4VMfJJLWXozLF4vbU7sk-iNn12NfHyrhw6Wu24Cf3m_wBu_AX-dAlRna0QFEMmdId6EQ6cH9KSk-wp1kDT8EKyEin8lr3KPYiTKLuZpBWLZeLaqEHSHb-FK-cx3C98OoKukNpQQz8NRkvHMZancBkzaN048OD2pwx6wJpJ-mggFmJ8UkWPCcjhxc_A&sig=Cg0ArKJSzEhzc-MOOe5YEAE&fbs_aeid=\\[gw_fbsaeid\\]&urlfix=1&adurl=https://www.marketingdive.com/trendline/cookie-alternatives/267/%3Futm_source%3DMD%26utm_medium%3DNative%26utm_campaign%3DChicory)\n\n  TRENDLINE\n\n  ### How marketers are preparing for a cookie-less world\n\n*“Since reels offer a more immersive and entertaining way to watch and create videos on Instagram, we’re bringing the full-screen experience to your video posts, too.

That’s not exactly short form, which means that pretty much all uploaded videos in the app will now be fed into the Reels stream.\n\nIn some ways, that makes sense. Reels is the [fastest growing content format in the app](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-adds-new-boost-promotion-option-for-reels-clips/627650/), and the broader popularity of TikTok has led to habitual changes in consumption behavior, which means that users are now instinctively more aligned to the format.\n\nIn that sense, Instagram should feed into it where it can – but still…\n\nThe broader concept would be that as more people watch Reels, more content can only be beneficial for engagement, while it should also mean more views on your clips, as they’ll be surfaced within that stream.\n\nBut it could also make Instagram less differentiated, less unique - and again, it does feel a little desperate from Zuck and Co.\n\nEither way, it’s a new dawn for Instagram content, and it’ll be worth monitoring your stats, and considering how you can best lean into the latest Reels trends to maximize engagement.", "timestamp": 1658550538, "digest": "ypR9eZCDgfr3q1KJ237feH3ihH4p5va9oaCel87eKjs", "contributor": "0x0B370be3b0aD83cB5AC159e3Fee5Ea7209B6cD83"}

一、撸毛做交互，分析数据的重要性\n\n现在做撸毛交互非常的卷，在交互的过程中，知己知彼才有可能撸到大毛。项目方面对大量的用户时，会做筛选过滤掉单纯撸毛的用户，留下真正的用户给与更多的奖励。\n\n根据过往dydx等项目发空投的经验，项目方会根据阶梯发放奖励，构成阶梯的指标有：交互金额，交互次数，交互功能，交互日期等。\n\n要做到自己的交互的金额和频次大于大部分人时，你才能获得更多的空投，如何知道这些数据呢 ?\n\n区块链的数据库是开源的，任何人都可以查看，我们可以使用SQL语言查询各个项目的交互信息，下面是使用dune数据库进行分析的步骤。\n\n# 二、partybid为例进行数据分析\n\n本篇教程以partybid为例，进行数据分析。\n\n分析一个项目的前提是，你已经确定这个项目未来会发币，项目靠谱有需求，最近有融资投资，有知名投资机构。\n\n## 2.1、寻找项目的合约\n\n首先去[partybid官网](%5BPartyBid%5D(https://www.partybid.app/all))，参与一次众筹，通过[区块链浏览器](https://etherscan.io/)查询交互的合约名称是什么。\n\n下图是我交互完成后的链上记录，可以点击红框查看合约地址。\n\n![未命名1658543640png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-10-34-23-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658543640.png)\n\n进入合约页面后，点击 Contract查看合约的名称是：NonReceivableInitializedProxy\n\n![未命名1658544294png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-10-45-06-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658544294.png)\n\n拿到合约名称后，去dune上搜索，查看dune是否有收录这个合约的数据。\n\n![未命名1658544777png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-10-53-30-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658544777.png)\n\n发现这个合约名称并没有收录，从合约名称上看这好像不是官方的合约名称，我们回到区块浏览器继续分析，可以通过数据发现这个合约交互了792次，每次交互金额0.01，这个合约应该是众筹NFT的合约，并不是partybid的主合约，我们需要拿到主合约来分析整个项目的数据。\n\n![未命名1658544942png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-10-55-53-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658544942.png)\n\n这众筹NFT的合约肯定是通过主合约创建的，我们继续在区块链浏览器中寻找。\n\n通过下图，我们可以发现，这个合约是10天前通过红框的地址创建的，这个地址既然可以创建合约，那他自身肯定是个合约。\n\n![未命名1658545223png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-00-29-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658545223.png)\n\n我们进入这个地址，发现的确是个合约，查看他的合约代码，发现合约名称是：CollectionPartyFactory\n\n![未命名1658545348png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-03-29-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658545348.png)\n\n进入dune上，搜索合约名称，发现dune已经收录这个合约地址上的数据了。\n\n![未命名1658545568png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-06-42-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658545568.png)\n\n## 2.2、分析数据结构，寻找有用的数据\n\n可以通过函数名称粗略判断，我们要提取的数据在哪个函数中。\n\n然后通过查询语句看看存的数据是否为我们想要的。\n\n```\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  partydao.\"CollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty\"\nLIMIT\n  10\n```\n\n我们先查下第一个函数，发现当中不存在任何数据。\n\n![未命名1658545860png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-11-27-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658545860.png)\n\n我们继续查下一个函数，查询到“CollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty”中有数据\n\n![未命名1658546249png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-17-36-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658546249.png)\n\nCollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty 中有很多列，我们如何知道每列的具体含义呢，可以根据每列的名称 结合 具体的数据去猜测，再跟自己交互数据关联起来，来最终确定。\n\n_nftContract ： 众筹的NFT合约地址\n\noutput_partyProxy：可能是创建众筹项目的合约地址。\n\n我们之前参与了一个众筹，可以通过众筹的合约来验证下。\n\n众筹的合约地址：0xbd1e6e6012f969ed554806E96B3E8C519E0C14b5\n\n发现可以查到这一个合约，这个合约众筹的对象是BAYC，跟我们交互的项目一致。\n\n![未命名1658547035png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-30-44-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658547035.png)\n\n## 2.3、制定交互策略的思路\n\n我们分析数据的目的是刷交互获得空投，所以首先思考哪行行为动作会对项目方有利，最简单的就是罗列项目的所有功能，然后根据自己的判断设置对应的权重。\n\npartybid这个项目目前功能比较简单，就以下2个：\n\n* 发起众筹项目\n* 参与众筹项目\n\n发起众筹的人数少于参与众筹的人数，发起众筹的权重高，众筹成功，金额大，参与人数多的的权重大。参与众筹项目成功的权重高，参与次数多，金额大的权重高。\n\n那么到底发起几个众筹，参与多少次众筹，参与金额多少 才能脱颖而出呢，这时就需要的链上数据进行分析。\n\n## 2.4、查找数据确定交互策略\n\n### 2.4.1、参与众筹金额控制在多少好呢？\n\n我们通过链上数据可以进行查询。\n\n查询思路：\n\n1、确定要查询的数据库数据表分布在哪\n\n2、编写SQL语句进行查询\n\n通过“CollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty” 我们可以知道 partybid众筹的合约地址。\n\n“ethereum.transactions”这个表可以查询所有在以太坊上产生的交互。\n\n我们先获取到参与众筹的地址，然后看这些地址共参与了多少金额\n\n具体的SQL语句如何编写，可以自行谷歌搜索学习，然后复制(fork)下面的语句改写。\n\n```\n-- 查询用户参与众筹金额的区间\nwith\n  party as(\n    SELECT\n      sum(value / 1e18) as \"total\",\n      et.\"from\"\n    from\n      partydao.\"CollectionPartyFactory_call_startParty\" party\n      LEFT JOIN ethereum.transactions et on party.\"output_partyProxy\" = et.\"to\"\n    group by\n      et.\"from\"\n    ORDER by\n      \"total\" DESC\n  )\nselect\n  count(distinct party.\"from\") as \"数量\",\n  case\n    when party.total > 1 then ' > 1 ETH'\n    when party.total between 0.1 and 1 then '[0.1-1] ETH'\n    when party.total < 0.1 and party.total > 0.01 then '(0.01-0.1) ETH'\n    when party.total = 0.01 then '0.01 ETH'\n    else '< 0.01 ETH'\n  end as \"参与众筹金额区间\"\nfrom\n  party\ngroup by\n  2\n```\n\n![未命名1658548417png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yakim1429/yakimIMG/main/2022/07/23-11-54-00-%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D1658548417.png)\n\n不愿意动手查询数据的，也可以直接duen上搜索项目关键字进行查询别人已经做好的图表。\n\n**关于partybid更多的数据，可以查看我做好的图表。**\n\n[#

{"id": "OD31OsQ2D4beyDHfKWnx-qiKznB4XKrjP5oP4zoiqGE", "title": "Conspiracy & Me", "body": "### I'll never forget the 20th anniversary of 9/11.\n\nI spent the latter half of the day huddled up in my living room, carefully reading a book from Popular Mechanics called [Debunking 9/11 Myths](https://www.amazon.com/Debunking-11-Myths-Conspiracy-Theories-ebook/dp/B0751HHGMS/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=).\n\nThat night, for the first time since my teenage years, I went to bed with my lingering questions answered. I'd finally put my own conspiracy thinking to rest.\n\nThis is the story of how I came into those beliefs, and the long, winding path to ridding myself of them. It's also a meditation on how we, as a society, can do a better job of reaching people who are caught up in destructive belief systems.\n\n\n---\n\nI was 10 when the towers collapsed.\n\nWe were living in Redondo Beach, CA at the time. I'd just gotten up for school, and my mom and stepdad were intermittently and anxiously glancing at the news as they got ready for work.\n\nI remember watching footage of the second plane hitting, then being awkwardly shuffled off to school. That day, we tried to focus on normal fourth grade activities, but everyone could feel something was terribly wrong. My teacher started crying when we'd learned the towers had come down.\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur. In those days, I was obsessed with baseball—playing it, watching it, the whole deal. And I remember filtering the aftermath of 9/11 through the lens of sports. I watched every game in the MLB playoffs, every tear-filled tribute and moment of silence, including [George Bush's iconic first pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjGcCI9ByWw) in the World Series a month later.\n\nBut eventually everything went back to normal in my little world. It would be years before I'd think about 9/11 again.\n\n\n---\n\nSomewhere in high school—either sophomore or junior year—the conspiracies found me.\n\nBrowsing around the internet, I somehow stumbled across a free documentary. I don't remember which one. Maybe it was Loose Change. Or perhaps it was the first film in the Zeitgeist series.\n\nRegardless, that first exposure to conspiracy thinking was exhilarating. I felt alive.\n\nFor my teenage self—already a bit of an outsider with a rebellious streak—this forbidden fruit was delicious. It felt like I'd woken up to something big, something no one else could see. I relished in my newfound beliefs, because frankly, they made me feel intelligent, unique, and significant.\n\nOnce those seeds were planted, everything new I saw or read seemed to confirm my suspicions of foul play.\n\nIn my senior year of high school, I took a class on post-WWII American history. At one point, we dug into how the CIA had helped overthrow democratic governments around the world—in Iran, in Chile, in Guatemala. It cemented my belief that the US government wasn't to be trusted, and was capable of horrific things.\n\nDuring those years, my dad and I would often get lunch at a Jewish deli in Denver. I remember a handful of animated discussions, one in particular where I tried to argue—without any actual engineering knowledge, mind you—that it was physically impossible for a plane to cause those buildings to fall the way they did. Despite his best rhetorical efforts, my dad's arguments went in one ear, and out the other.\n\nBy the time I'd made it to my freshman year in college, my conspiracy brain was at its most impenetrable. I'd built myself a fortress of delusional certitude.\n\n\n---\n\nFrom age 20 to 30, I spoke nary a peep about 9/11.\n\nPartly because my enthusiasm had waned over the years. I no longer bought into any of the grand narratives or explanations—that it was planned by the Bush administration, or that the Illuminati were ushering in a new world order or whatever. Somewhere along the way, the speculative \"who dunnit\" stuff had begun to feel empty and childish.\n\nI also lost my zest for going any deeper into my lingering questions. Where once I was enthralled by the rabbit holes and the chase, in my twenties I channeled my energy into things like filmmaking, dating, figuring out adulthood, and building a business.\n\nNurturing the conspiracy didn't serve the same psychological purpose it once did. I found new, healthier ways to feel good about myself. I found new outlets for my time and energy. As such, many of those old beliefs just shriveled up and died on their own.\n\nIn high school and early college, I might have topped out at 7 of 10 on the conspiracy scale. But without any external intervention, or even intention or effort on my part, I cruised through my twenties at a cool 2 of 10.\n\n\n---\n\nEven though it was never top of mind, there was always a doubtful little voice in the back of my head, which would pipe up whenever someone mentioned 9/11.\n\nYet I never shared these doubts, not even with my closest friends. The social cost felt too high. There was always a fear I'd be branded a \"truther\" and that I'd carry a scarlet letter for the rest of my life. Whether that would have happened or not, I have no idea. But I always felt on edge about my dark little secret spilling out.\n\nAt this point, I had just two lingering questions—the things that stuck out to me as evidence of something fishy.\n\n1. How could two towers, designed to withstand impact from planes, be damaged asymmetrically, then fall symmetrically at freefall speed?\n2. What the hell was the deal with building 7? How did it collapse the way it did without having been hit by a plane?\n\nIn my mind, the official explanations for these things were insufficient. It felt like I was being told not to trust my lying eyes.\n\nOf course, I'd *never actually read* the official explanations myself. I'd just believed the conspiracy folks when they said the official story was bogus. My understanding of these topics came from second hand (possibly even third or fourth hand) information.\n\n\n---\n\nLike many, the 2016 election—and the ensuing years of epistemic chaos and culture war meltdowns—woke me up to the dangers of conspiracy thinking at scale.\n\nI watched as broad swaths of the political media ecosystem, both left and right, become addled with simplistic conspiratorial speculation.\n\nI saw family members become Q-Anon true believers, to the point of cutting ties with anyone who disagreed.\n\nWe all saw conspiracy thinking undermine our pandemic response and vaccine rollout.\n\nAnd of course, we all witnessed several storms of riotous violence stemming directly from widespread conspiracies.\n\nFrom my vantage, it became increasingly clear that conspiracy thinking—on the right, left, and anywhere else—is not only contagious, but inherently destabilizing. It can lead to the fracture of relationships, families, communities, and entire societies.\n\nAnd, of course, left unchecked, it can lead to dehumanization and violence.\n\n\n---\n\n2018 was unequivocally the worst year of my life.\n\nBut looking back, it taught me a valuable lesson about the nature of conspiracy thinking.\n\nHaving just moved to Tucson, I found myself disconnected from family and friends. My relationship was falling apart. My business was floundering. And I used food as an emotional escape, sending my health and fitness into a downward spiral. It was the loneliest, most hopeless, depressive year of my life.\n\nDuring those dark days, the one reliable place I found solace and comfort was in culture war media. Much as [Meghan Daum talks about making friends on \"free speech YouTube\"](https://gen.medium.com/nuance-a-love-story-ae6a14991059) after her marriage fell apart, I started going down my own rabbit hole with the \"intellectual dark web.\"\n\nIt started with podcasts like Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, and the Brothers Weinstein. And it led to YouTube, where I'd rarely miss a video from folks like Dave Rubin, Matt Christiansen, and Steven Crowder. I'm ashamed to admit it, but watching people dunk on and ridicule woke college students was gratifying in a visceral way. And for brief moments, there was light amidst the darkness of my life. I felt better about myself.\n\nThe thing about culture war media—both left and right—is that it's predicated on believing in the unambiguous badness of \"them\" (however your team defines it). Culture wars are fueled by simplistic stories about how the world works—stories that constantly reaffirm the virtue of our team, and the evil of theirs. And in culture war media ecosystems, and the resulting filter bubbles, inconvenient facts are ignored, while other facts are distorted (or invented) to fit the narrative. Everything must fit the narrative.\n\nIn other words, culture war thinking and conspiracy thinking are one in the same. The culture wars are political conspiracies at scale. And at the darkest point in my life, I was caught up in the thick of it.\n\n\n---\n\nAfter my toxic relationship ended, and I started getting healthy again, my attraction to conspiratorial thinking and culture war media vanished. As if by magic.\n\nThe healthier my body and mind became, the more I was not only uninterested in the media that had once nourished me, but I was repulsed by it. I remember one day in particular where I opened YouTube, watched two minutes of a Dave Rubin video, and said out loud, \"*Wow, this guy is a clown.*\" And I haven't been back since.\n\nAs I healed myself, I saw clearly how the culture wars had been a cheap substitute for what I actually needed and wanted out of life. It was like the shitty fast food version of belonging and meaning.\n\nThat led to a stark realization. I'm most susceptible to conspiracy thinking when I'm at my worst. When my core needs around agency, connection, belonging, and meaning aren't being met in healthy ways, I gravitate towards the nearest, loudest thing that soothes my psyche. And I suspect I'm not the only one.\n\nIn advanced industrial societies, we're good at a lot of things, but our track record of helping people meet these core psychological needs is abysmal. We live in the most materially wealthy and technologically advanced time and place the world has ever known, yet a substantial portion of the population is starving for what matters most.\n\nIt's like there's a severe drought in our collective psyche, just waiting for a spark to set off an uncontrollable wildfire of conspiracy, fear, and loathing of self and other.\n\nI've come to believe it's not \"misinformation\" that's the problem here. This isn't social media's fault. The conspiracies spreading through society are merely a symptom, not a root cause.\n\nUntil we start tackling the interconnected crises of meaning, loneliness, and physical and mental health, there's no way short of brutal authoritarianism to prevent emotionally compelling conspiracies from taking root in the minds of a dispossessed populace.\n\nIf that's true, then it's up to us, individually and collectively, to recognize this dynamic for what it is, then pull ourselves out of those downward spirals. And from there, it's our responsibility to help others do the same. There is no top down solution to this. The only things that reverse these worrying trends are individuals, then communities, learning to meet their needs in healthy, constructive ways.\n\n\n---\n\nAll of this brings us back to September 11th, 2021. The twentieth anniversary.\n\nI'd spent the previous few years continuing to work on myself, and rooting out various forms of conspiratorial thinking. I'd learned to spot and reject simplistic culture war narratives. I'd learned to go to the source instead of relying on shoddy second hand information. And I'd learned to feel at home in complexity and ambiguity, instead of needing simplistic narratives to feel secure.\n\nBut still, those two pesky questions about 9/11 remained. *How did the towers fall the way they did, and how did building 7 fall?*\n\nOn this day, the door was open for me. It was an opportunity to step fully out of the realm of conspiracy, and into the identity of Citizen.\n\nI started my quest that afternoon with a google search.\n\nI skimmed a few articles, and was immediately put off. Everything I found was seething with condescension and ridicule. There was little in the way of genuinely informative media for people seeking answers. There was only shaming and disgust, as if people who believed in these conspiracies were morally corrupted and unsalvageable.\n\nNeedless to say, this dynamic didn't help. And it nearly stopped me from searching further. Like everyone else, I want to be treated with dignity, and like an adult.\n\nBut on a whim, I grabbed a kindle copy of the Popular Mechanics book. Despite a few hints of condescension in the early pages, this book felt different. It took each claim of conspiracy seriously, on its own terms, without strawmanning or ridicule. Then it meticulously picked each claim apart, one by one, relying on a diverse array of subject matter experts. It didn't insult the intelligence of the reader, but instead catered to it.\n\nSo over the course of about three hours, I devoured the chapters that addressed my lingering doubts, and skimmed a few others. I found conceivable scientific explanations for how the damage, along with raging fires, had brought down those three buildings twenty years earlier.\n\nAnd as you might guess, I came away that evening satisfied. I believed the official accounts and explanations were, at the very least, *plausible*.\n\n\n---\n\nHere's a humbling truth about this whole saga.\n\nI'm far too much of a scientific and engineering layman to know if what I read that night is true. Without becoming an engineer myself, there's no way for me to directly answer any of these questions. I had to outsource this one to subject matter experts. And I did. That Popular Mechanics book provided enough reasonable doubt for me to put my conspiracy thinking to bed.\n\nAs I type these words, I'm reminded of this passage from Jonathan Haidt's seminal book, [The Righteous Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777):\n\n> “*The social psychologist Tom Gilovich studies the cognitive mechanisms of strange beliefs. His simple formulation is that **when we want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe it?”** Then we search for supporting evidence, and if we find even a single piece of pseudo-evidence, we can stop thinking. We now have permission to believe. We have a justification, in case anyone asks. **In contrast, when we don’t want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Must I believe it?”** Then we search for contrary evidence, and if we find a single reason to doubt the claim, we can dismiss it.*”\n\nWhen I look at conspiracy communities, including the various culture war tribes, mostly what I see is lonely, disaffected people desperate for a sense of meaning and community in their lives. I see people unwilling or unable to grapple with complexity, because the simple narratives that surround them are too seductive.\n\nThis isn't a judgment. It's just that I've been in that place. I've been that person. More than once. And I have no intention of going back.\n\nPoint being, **I was able to break free from conspiracy thinking because I wanted to. And because I *needed* to.** It was the only way for me to create a sense of coherence in my worldview, and to cement my [emerging identity as a Citizen](https://ungated.life/essay/on-citizenship/). Conspiracy thinking is antithetical to who I'm trying to become, and what I'm trying to model in the world.\n\nBut here's the thing. Reading the Popular Mechanics book almost certainly wouldn't have changed my mind in any of the preceding years. It took the culmination of everything I've written about here to get me to the finish line.\n\nHad 19 year old Rob picked up that book, it wouldn't have made a lick of difference. If I were a member of the truther tribe, finding my sense of identity and meaning amongst 9/11 true believers, I'd likely have never even picked up that book, let alone read and believed it. And had I not grappled with the culture war, and become deeply distrustful of conspiracy thinking, I doubt I would have felt the urgency to seek answers that evening.\n\nTherein lies the inconvenient truth of solving conspiracy thinking on a society-wide scale.\n\nThe easy part of this equation is creating high quality, widely accessible information that respects the consumer and treats them with dignity. The more we ridicule and shame people harboring conspiratorial beliefs, the more we push them further away and calcify their worldview.\n\nBut here's the hard part. For any information to make a widespread difference, people must want it. They must be ready, willing, and able to displace their old beliefs with new ones. Coercion and top down solutions won't solve this problem. They'll only make it worse.\n\nWe need to start treating the root causes of systemic disaffection, instead of slapping bandaids on a stab wound. We need to find new ways to bring people together, give them shared meaning, and help them meet their core psychological needs in constructive ways. Because otherwise, conspiratorial thinking shows no signs of slowing its march into the heart of the body politic.\n\nI don't have the solutions to any of that. But I believe it's one of the most important sets of problems for committed Citizens to work on in the years ahead. So I hope you, like me, are ready to work on it, together.\n\nGood luck, and godspeed.", "timestamp": 1658550714, "digest": "klkNioHOU0aaF_V6ZMSbnZKSBFXzs6nxtqbVE77apYU", "contributor": "0x802331595305BF81C9D0cd78e3d7D73186A3aAae"}
{"id": "ZNjVaoGgSZD_3XUnLnFj1l50dmvbudBWBt9pHbiU8dM", "title": "Non-Coercive Marketing: An Origin Story", "body": "For the last year, I’ve been working to improve my relationship with food, and with myself more generally. Little did I suspect this journey would also completely transform how I approach marketing.\n\nBut let’s start at the beginning. For the better part of fifteen years, food has been my drug of choice, and my kryptonite. It's my go-to strategy on those days when I want to escape, or when I need to soothe some emotional wound. Some people drink, others numb with TV or social media. My vice was, and still sometimes is, copious quantities of unhealthy food.\n\nThis pattern has wreaked havoc in my life. I gained weight all through my twenties, and my self-worth and self-image plummeted, remaining in the gutter for years. And the negative ripple effects spread into everything, from business and productivity to friendships and romance. My relationship to food left me feeling broken, fatalistic, and hopeless.\n\nOver the years, I tried anything and everything to “fix myself.” I did the diets, the challenges, the accountability programs. Every new cure I stumbled across would work for a few weeks, giving me a brief glimpse of hope, before I inevitably backslid into binging and self-loathing.\n\nI couldn’t see it at the time, but all of these attempts had one thing in common. They always started from a belief that I needed an *external intervention*, because left to my own devices, I could not be *trusted* to take care of myself.\n\n# II\n\nIn early 2021 I hired [Michael Ashcroft](https://www.michaelashcroft.org/) as a coach. Michael does some fairly traditional coaching in the Co-Active style, but he also brings his [background in Alexander Technique](https://robhardy--michaelashcroft.thrivecart.com/fundamentals-of-alexander-technique/) into his sessions, along with a bit of Zen and Daoist philosophy for good measure.\n\nAt the time, I was beating myself up for failing to complete a masochistic challenge called 75Hard, wherein you have to workout twice a day, once outdoors, for 75 days straight. No days off. No compromises. I’d made it to day 43 before falling off the wagon, and I felt myself backsliding into old patterns around food. So when I first started working with Michael, I was considering restarting that challenge. I felt like I needed something, anything, to feel back in control of my life.\n\nBut like any good coach, Michael didn’t automatically buy into the stories I was telling myself. And in one of our first sessions, he asked a question that has been resonating through my life ever since.\n\n*What if you didn’t need a fancy external system, or to put tons of pressure on yourself, to eat well? What if you just trusted yourself?*\n\nAt first, that question pissed me off a bit. All available evidence pointed to me not being trustworthy with food. Part of me was sure if I let myself off the hook, I would embark on a rampage of gluttony, the likes of which I’d never recover from. But there was another part of me that was like, “*wait a minute, what if he’s right?*”\n\nAnd just like that, I had been non-coercion-pilled.\n\n# III\n\nPhilosophically, non-coercion is based on a radical idea—that deep down, at your core, you are *already trustworthy*. You can trust yourself to make the right decision, the healthy decision, the moral decision, without the need for external pressure or coercion. You are enough as you are, and you already have the wisdom to navigate a complex world inside of you. If you slow down, and stop trying to brute force your way through things, you can access that source of wisdom whenever you want.\n\nLike I said, it's radical idea, and if you pull on that thread hard enough, it begins to unravel a good deal of how individuals and institutions in the West operate. And it usually points directly back to Daoism and other Eastern spiritual traditions. But that's an article for another day.\n\nFor me, this one question—what if I trusted myself—put me on the path towards intuitive eating. I started learning how to listen to my body. I took a leap of faith into an uncertain world where my food decisions weren't already made for me by an external authority. And I began rebuilding trust with myself, day by day. And look, I still struggle with food from time to time. But with each passing month that I approach this pattern non-coercively, it gets a little better. The more I trust myself, the more its grip loosens, and the rest of my life opens up.\n\nAnd that brings us, finally, to the subject of marketing. Because it turns out, once I'd embraced non-coercion in one area, it began to spill over into every other context of my life, including my business, and my quest to create true fans.\n\n# IV\n\nThere’s a technique in copywriting known as “twisting the knife.” I first picked it up from Ramit Sethi, but it goes back decades to the early titans of direct response marketing.\n\nBasically, you make the strategic decision to *amplify* someone’s pain. You jab your rhetorical blade someplace tender, someplace that’s already harboring an emotional wound, then you twist it and twist it good. You vividly describe their pains and insecurities so they can really *feel* them. You walk your prospect through the nightmarish consequences if they don’t fix the problem your product solves. And voila, they're in an emotional state that's more conducive to making a purchase *right now*, because they want to relieve the pain caused by your knife twist.\n\nIn the marketing landscape, there are dozens of tools like this, all designed to heighten someone's emotional state, and either nudge or bludgeon them towards making a purchase as quickly as possible. Whether that's knife twisting, adding artificial scarcity or urgency, or making emotional promises that are too good to be true, the marketing industry has emotional coercion down to a science.\n\nToday, all of this stuff feels gross to me. But back when my relationship to myself was rooted in coercion, I had few qualms with tools like this. I used brute force and emotional manipulation against myself all the time. It was my primary tool for getting myself to do things I thought I should do. So it never felt particularly wrong to use it on anyone else.\n\nIt's funny, because I've always believed in [following the golden rule in marketing](https://ungated.media/article/golden-rule/), and not treating others in ways you wouldn't want to be treated yourself. But when my relationship to myself was shitty and rooted in distrust, following that rule wasn't worth a whole lot. It's yet another example of how wounded people can perpetuate harm in the world without even realizing it, often while thinking they're doing good.\n\nAs you might have already guessed, once I started embracing non-coercion in the context of food, and feeling just how nurturing it is to live that way, so too did my relationship to marketing begin to change.\n\nThe questions driving me now are, what if we took the tools of emotional coercion off the table? What if we simply *trusted* people to make the best decision for themselves?\n\n# V\n\nI haven’t shared this much, but the long-term vision for Ungated goes well beyond helping people make 1,000 True Fans a reality. What I’m really after is to help usher in a renaissance on the internet. A new golden age, if you will.\n\nMaybe it’s just me, but most of what I encounter online these days leaves me disheartened. So much of the creative work I see feels like a cheap copy of a copy, ripped from some soulless playbook. Every human is a unique tapestry of experiences and beliefs and stories, yet little of that diversity or vibrance makes it to the web. What’s worse is that many online cultures feel increasingly captured in cycles of distrust and nihilism and cynicism and zero sum thinking.\n\nHumanity has a fuck ton of potential. Both individually and collectively, we’re capable of astounding feats of imagination and creation. But the internet as it exists right now is stifling that potential. It’s slowly turning us into the worst versions of ourselves.\n\nI wrote a piece awhile back about [bridging the trust gap](https://ungated.media/article/bridging-the-trust-gap/). Here’s a key excerpt.\n\n> Humanity’s best attributes—connection, curiosity, generosity, empathy—come out to play when we trust each other. At a fundamental level, trust is the emotional glue that makes widespread collaboration and flourishing possible. To shape the internet into the place we all want it to be—an open, generous, life-sustaining web of connection—trust has to be at the very center of how we operate.\n\nAnd that brings us back around to non-coercion, and how we choose to market and sell to one another.\n\nTruth be told, I’m still figuring out what Non-Coercive Marketing looks like as a practical philosophy. As far as I can tell, this is uncharted territory, as 98% of what I find in the marketing world is deeply rooted in coercion and distrust.\n\nSo from here on out, my plan is to [run experiments](https://ungated.media/experiments/) (in public, of course) and start iterating my way into marketing that feels positive sum, nurturing, and aligned with the world as I believe it can be.\n\nBut here’s what I can tell you. **Non-Coercive Marketing is a leap of faith that requires you to trust yourself, and trust others.** It’s about putting work into the world that is uniquely reflective of who you are, and what you stand for. It’s about creating invitations for the people who resonate, and who want to go deeper. It’s about trusting that if you’re visible in the world, the right people will find you, and be thrilled to accept your invitation.\n\nAnd with that, I would like to extend my own invitation. If, like me, you believe we’re all capable of more, and that humanity’s best years lie ahead, what I’m building at Ungated is for you. Doing creative work on the internet is only one piece of a larger puzzle, but it’s a meaningful piece.

That said, nothing is official until it's official, so we welcome any leak that comes our way.\n\n## Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4 will probably be priced the same as the predecessors\n\n \n \n\nLeaker [SnoopyTech](https://twitter.com/_snoopytech_/status/1550462164376473600), who has an impressive track record, claims that the [Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Another-round-of-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-leaks---battery-life-weight-and-more-renders_id141433) will come with 12GB of RAM which will be mated with either 256GB or 512GB of storage. They don't rule out the possibility of the rumored 1TB variant, but doesn't mention the [128GB version](https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-color-storage-options_id141333) that was mentioned in a leak recently. They do point out that their tweet pertains to the variants that will be sold by third parties, and does not include the models that will be sold exclusively by Samsung.\n\n \n \n\nThe Fold 4 will be available in Graygreen, Phantom Black, and Beige, which indicates the alleged Red version will only be available through Samsung.\n\n \n \n\nThe [Flip 4](https://www.phonearena.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-4-official-first-render-video-teaser_id141431) will have 8GB of RAM and storage options will include 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. Color options will include Blue, Graphite, Pink Gold, and Bora Purple.\n\n \n \n\nInitially, there were rumors that the Fold 4 and Flip 4 will be cheaper than their predecessors, but a recent report said that the Flip 4 might be a [little more expensive](https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-price-higher-than-z-flip-3_id141451). According to a blog called *[Gizpaw](https://gizpaw.com/galaxy-z-flip-4/)*, a European retailer has already listed the phones, and per the listings, the 256GB Fold 4 will set you back €1,863 and the 512GB model will be priced at €1,981. \n\n \n \n\nThe same [outlet says](https://gizpaw.com/galaxy-z-fold-4/) that the 128GB Z Flip 4 will cost €1,080, the 256GB edition will go for €1,158, and the maxed-out model will fetch €1,275.\n\n \n \n\nIn contrast, as pointed out by Twitter user Alvin ([@sondesix](https://twitter.com/sondesix/status/1550469151419801600)), the 256GB Fold 3 had a price tag of €1,799, and the 128GB Flip 3 was launched for €1,049. \n\n \n \n\nSnoopyTech has outright said that those prices are wrong and has questioned the credibility of *Gizpaw*. He believes that prices will stay the same as the last generation, considering Samsung's current foldable phones, particularly the Flip 3, did pretty well. The prices mentioned by *Gizpaw* look off anyway, so it's possible they are just placeholder numbers. ", "timestamp": 1658551884, "digest": "addwjWMB3liJ11GVydkvkhy-pUGsLM5ExY9RUcH3cn0", "contributor": "0x4374aCdD2d1D413856C45cA284F33e01D0Ddd533"}

{"id": "cMOqLNIwPSSqqX4lnWJSIfva4LG8M753BocQgHAZqqs", "title": "rabbithole guide snapshot", "body": "rabbithole guide\n\nIn a **[previous guide](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/hWT7XjQb1m3VjZCPBuVfETfkbIRCRhGy5CZwZdpAmAo)**, we voted on a proposal with Snapshot. But there are times when casting your own vote may not seem like the best option. However, there is still a way to put your votes to use - **delegation**.\n\nFor this step of our DAO path, we’ll be **delegating LDO tokens to the RabbitHole Metagovernance Pod**. This will increase the voting power of RabbitHole’s MetaGov Pod and directly contribute to the positive impact we strive to make on the Lido ecosystem!\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we delegate some voting power, let’s make sure you’ve got everything you need. In order to vote on a Snapshot, you will need:\n\n* An Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow\n* ETH in that wallet\n* LDO in that wallet\n\n*If you need help, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w)** and watch our guide on **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s).** And if you don’t have $LDO, you can acquire some from Uniswap. Check out **[this guide](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5391957-how-to-swap-tokens)** if you need help with swapping tokens on Uniswap.*\n\n## Delegation & Snapshot\n\nWe already learned about the decentralized voting system, **[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/)**, in a **[previous guide](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/hWT7XjQb1m3VjZCPBuVfETfkbIRCRhGy5CZwZdpAmAo)**. But for today’s leg of our journey, we’ll be delegating instead of voting ourselves.\n\n**Delegation** grants you the ability to appoint your governance tokens or voting power to an active, qualified representative while retaining ownership of those tokens. If for whatever reason you don’t feel comfortable voting on a proposal or will be unable to vote at the time it takes place, delegating allows another DAO, individual, or fellow DAO member of your choosing to vote on your behalf.\n\nIt’s important to note that delegated tokens never actually leave your wallet, so you still retain complete ownership of them. You also have the option to revoke or change your delegation at any time before voting closes. This can be useful if your chosen delegate decides to vote in a way that you are not comfortable with or decides not to vote at all. Similarly, you can still choose to cast your own vote, which will override your delegation automatically.\n\n**With that out of the way, let’s get started!**\n\n## The Guide\n\n### Step 1\n\nFirst, **navigate to Snapshot’s delegation page - <https://snapshot.org/#/delegate>.**\n\n### Step 2\n\n**Click *Connect Wallet,*** choose your wallet provider, and then **connect.**\n\n### Step 3\n\n**Enter the wallet address or ENS name** of the individual you wish to delegate your voting power to. In this instance, we’ll be delegating to RabbitHole’s Metagovernance wallet - **0x86C62a0DD8690fa2Ba6e3E3D9A18D021dBd2565A.**\n\nAt RabbitHole, we are committed to being good stewards in the web3 space. But don’t just take our word for it. When delegating votes to anyone, you should always verify that they will be using that power appropriately. You can verify all of RabbitHole’s metagovernance decisions on our **[Metagovernance Pod Gitbook](https://rabbithole-2.gitbook.io/metagovernance/),** and join in on these discussions yourself in **[our Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz).**\n\n### Step 4\n\nThen, **click *Limit delegation to a specific space*** and **enter lido-snapshot.eth** into the new box that appears. This ensures you are only delegating your voting power to this single space.\n\n### Step 5\n\nFinally, **click *Confirm*** and then **confirm the transaction in your wallet.** This will be your first and final on-chain transaction, so it will require a small gas fee.\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nYour transaction will take a few moments to confirm, and then you will see a **Delegation Successful** icon appear at the bottom of your screen. You have officially delegated your LDO tokens to the RabbitHole Metagovernance pod — thank you! Although the RabbitHole MetaGov Pod can now vote on your behalf, you still retain ownership of your tokens and are able take back your voting power at any time.\n\nTo continue down the DAO rabbit hole, check out our other guides for **[voting on Snapshot proposals](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/hWT7XjQb1m3VjZCPBuVfETfkbIRCRhGy5CZwZdpAmAo)** and **[setting up a Gnosis Safe](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/oMXunCBmaNdvvR8lKFPFY28jBAa6nmfDJECpnX2vhpg)**!

The infrastructure is getting a big upgrade & there is a parallel internet being built on top of open blockchain infrastructures enabling the creation of decentralized applications which are not controlled by single points of control & are interoperable by design.

Is it true that it has better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it! \n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS costs slightly more in than Windows.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind. \n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

{"id": "CFnLJRb68hiDCy0dhlPXRju5KpfUJt-F74CxzkeHEM0", "title": "MacOs + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS for work? Is it true that it has better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it! \n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS costs slightly more in than Windows.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind. \n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

GM made only 400 Eldorado Broughams and they were entirely hand-assembled, not made on an assembly line. When it was new, the Eldorado cost just over $13,000 at a time when a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud could be purchased for about $16,000, said Wiley. (Adjusted for inflation, those figures would be roughly 10 times as much today.) Ironically, as a collectible car, a Cadillac Eldorado Brougham is today worth more than twice as much as a Silver Royce Silver Cloud, said Wiley.\n\n* \n\nIt's a bold move for the company which has repeatedly sought to re-identify itself for the past two decades. The first attempt was the Cadillac CTS, introduced in 2003, as the entry-level luxury American car to beat the BMW 3 Series. With its angular styling and crisp handling, it was a sharp departure from the comfortable cruising Cadillacs of past years. But the CTS reached its apex with just over 60,000 sold in 2005. Production ended in 2019. In most years, BMW sold around twice as many of the 3 Series.\n\nCadillac has made other attempts at re-invention, including a shift to alphanumeric names for its vehicles before going back to names again. There was also an attempt at creating an exclusive engine for the brand, dubbed the \"Blackwing\" V8, before ending production after just two years in 2020 with fewer than 1000 made.", "timestamp": 1658556060, "digest": "nmPD0kYj6Sy1EzUA96LnzptgEfphdwQnUOdD88cWeqs", "contributor": "0x544deeb20dF8Af825dcA2c5F26ba93830338cEB0"}

Есть кое-что, чего мы еще не выяснили.\n\nВы видите это повсюду. В настоящее время для установления новых связей люди используют личные сообщения в Twitter, Discord и LinkedIn. Но из-за отсутствия эффективного управления идентификацией обычно заканчивается тем, что человек вообще не подключается или каждый день просыпается с почтовым ящиком, заполненным случайными сообщениями в личку и спамом. Распространенность мошенничества и отсутствие контекста еще больше подрывают доброжелательность, которую мы испытываем к тем, кто находится за экранами, оставляя нас с навязчивым чувством недоверия, которое душит потенциальные связи и сотрудничество. Это приводит к тяжелым последствиям со стороны безопасности: в США потери из-за кражи личных данных и связанных с этим мошенничеств выросли с 1,8 миллиарда долларов в 2019 году до 3,3 миллиарда долларов в 2020 году и 5,8 миллиарда долларов в 2021 году (FTC, 2022).

Для пользователей не существует простых способов проверки утверждений и атрибутов конкретного удостоверения, а также нет сети для обнаружения и реальной связи на веб-уровне.\n\nДецентрализованная сеть, которую мы создаем с помощью блокчейн-технологий, имеет большие перспективы в сокращении числа вредных посредников и облегчении индивидуального однорангового сотрудничества. И теперь мы выходим за рамки финансовых вариантов использования и раскрываем огромный потенциал децентрализованного общества. Но как именно мы решаем эту проблему доверия и смысла в идентичностях?

Вдобавок ко всему, Link3 вводит новый набор измерений, которые рассказывают более достоверную и полную историю о том, кто вы есть:\n\n* **Cвязи**, которые у вас есть с другими людьми и организациями, независимо от платформ;\n* **Активы**, которыми вы владеете, которые соответствуют вашему статусу и вкусам; \n* **Учетные данные**, выданные третьими сторонами, такими как DAO и проекты, о ваших ключевых достижениях и ролях; \n* И все другие **записи о действиях в сети**, такие как голоса и пожертвования, которые подтверждают ваше участие в сообществах.\n\n**Эндогенный уровень доверия** вырастет из всех этих дополнительных измерений контекстов и значений, потому что они поддаются проверке.\n\nСостоящие из всех таких связей и записей, **реляционные идентичности**, подобные этим, являются органичными и развивающимися, подлинными и заслуживающими доверия, богатыми контекстом и значимыми, точно так же, как мы являемся социальными существами и хотели бы, чтобы все были в жизненно важных отношениях.\n\n\n---\n\n## Зачем именно вам нужен Link3?\n\n***Для пользователей*** с настроенным профилем Link3 предоставляется лучший способ для **надежного и значимого сетевого взаимодействия**. Благодаря более проверяемым параметрам, объединенным в вашем профиле, теперь у вас есть целостная личность, которая говорит правду о том, кто вы есть, и позволяет вам представить себя полным и достоверным образом. Продемонстрируйте свою принадлежность, учетные данные, активы и все другие записи в своем личном профиле и начните знакомство с сетью. Узнавайте и доверяйте кому-то мгновенно с помощью профиля Link3 в сети и без необходимости для верификации ссылок третьими лицами.\n\nКроме того, по мере создания контекстно-зависимых идентификационных данных и более значимых соединений сеть будет обладать **лучшей возможностью обнаружения**. Ожидайте, что к вам обратится больше людей, которые лучше понимают ваши сильные стороны, карьерные устремления, роль в обществе и личные вкусы. Также быстро найдите подходящего человека, к которому можно обратиться, и будьте уверены, что ваши запросы будут полностью переданы, поскольку профиль подкрепляет их.\n\nПеречислю несколько простых вариантов использования с некоторыми функциями, которые будут внедрены в ближайшем будущем:\n\n* Поделитесь своим профилем в специально разработанном формате визитной карточки, чтобы быстро продемонстрировать, кто вы и почему связи будут ценными.\n* Используйте свой профиль для подачи заявок и избавьтесь от всех ненужных процессов заполнения форм и отправки подтверждающих документов.\n* Ограничьте свою личную переписку чем-то большим, чем оплата или активы, и вместо этого пригласите тех людей с чертами характера, опытом и способностями, которые вы действительно цените. \n* Делегируйте свой голос людям, с которыми у вас есть значимые связи и которым вы действительно доверяете в отношении того, кем они являются в сообществе.\n\n***Для организаций и проектов*** Link3 может стать вашей универсальной ссылкой, которая поможет вашим подписчикам узнать о вас все в одном месте.\n\nОрганизационные профили Link3 **проверены и заслуживают доверия**. Чтобы защитить пользователей от мошенничества и поддельных ссылок, распространенных в Twitter и Discord, Link3 проверяет организации по их существующим официальным аккаунтам, таким как Twitter. Организации также могут связаться с другими авторитетными организациями и продемонстрировать это в разделах спонсоры / партнеры / команда. Позже организациям также будет разрешено выдавать поддающиеся проверке учетные данные или SBT, чтобы они могли распознавать ключевых участников сообщества. Структура доверия, состоящая из таких подключений и записей, обеспечивает надежность профилей Link3. Таким образом, пользователи будут уверены, что ссылки, по которым они переходят, и все полученные обновления являются официальными.\n\nПроекты, использующие Link3, также могут быть **лучше связаны с сообществом Web3**. Пользователи входят в систему с помощью кошельков, чтобы следить за проектами, и такие подключения основаны на адресах. Проекты могли бы создавать сообщества, ориентированные на Web3, и открывать возможность взаимодействовать с ними с помощью мероприятий, связанных с токенами, эйрдропов и многого другого.\n\n\n---\n\n## Разработано на CyberConnect\n\nLink3 построен поверх **децентрализованного протокола социального графа CyberСonnect** и будет вносить свой вклад в сеть передачи данных и механизм графа интересов. Link3 хранит всю информацию о профиле и подключениях **децентрализованным** и **независимым** образом. Такие профили и подключения  **не зависят от блокчейна** и **могут быть портированы** на любую платформу, разрушая стены изолированных централизованных платформ и позволяя пользователям и проектам полностью контролировать свои учетные данные и подключения.\n\nСосредоточив внимание на профессиональном контексте на первом этапе, Link3 наилучшим образом продемонстрирует, как социальный граф CyberConnect может способствовать сотрудничеству и созданию сетевых эффектов в более связном мире Web3.\n\n\n---\n\n## Присоединиться\n\nLink3 в настоящее время находится на стадии Alpha 1.0, только адреса, внесенные в белый список, или те, у кого есть коды приглашений, могут начать создавать свои верифицированные профили. Чтобы попасть в белый список на этом первом этапе, вам нужно: 1, Быть включенным уже верифицированным проектом Link 3 в раздел \"Команда\", \"Спонсоры\" или \"Участники\". (Например, pisofa.eth включен в раздел команды [link3.to/link3](https://link3.to/link3)). Если у проекта нет своего профиля, вы должны помочь команде настроить его! Или 2, быть тем, на кого подписан super KOL ([по мнению TwitterScan](https://twitterscan.com/view/trending/kol)) или топ-100 пользователей [ethleaderboard.xyz](http://ethleaderboard.xyz/).\n\nЧтобы быть в курсе предстоящего выпуска NFT и серии кампаний по внесению в белый список, присоединяйтесь к нашему сообществу  [Discord](https://discord.gg/EpYe82aFge) и подписывайтесь на Link3 в [Twitter](https://twitter.com/link3to).\n\nЧтобы узнать больше о Link3, посетите [http:/link3.to](http://Link3.to) и присоединяйтесь к списку ожидания [здесь](https://cyberconnect.typeform.com/to/zvkcmwYN).\n\n\n---\n\n*Ссылка на оригинал статьи:*\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/cyberlab.eth/WINRy_puyYIf3k16oEcroZsJJSVZ4oXAzH_lCDe6NXE](https://mirror.xyz/cyberlab.eth/WINRy_puyYIf3k16oEcroZsJJSVZ4oXAzH_lCDe6NXE)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658555663, "digest": "sHGSIKiJ4r81rX5sAsSebW8nN6yqJx34QejUZP6T-Gg", "contributor": "0x9706114C6068704911C0439f2341129e64604144"}

Is it true that it has better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS costs slightly more in than Windows.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

合作，实现不断发展的生态系统实施等，dApp。但为什么我们会专注于阿普托斯？\n\n简而言之，我们认为 Aptos 是广泛加密领域最好的第 1 层中区块链（即独立的主区块链，例如 Ethereum、Binance Smart Chain 或 Avalanche）。让我们深入了解 Aptos，或 Pontem选择它作为我们合作伙伴的确切原因。\n\n# 历史和团队\n\nAptos [Shaikh Shaikh由](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moalishaikh)[Avery Ching](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averyching)（首席技术官）（首席技术官）在 Facebook 上（特别是 Facebook）。最初在 Meta，合作区块链和 Novi 项目链上。Shaikh 在 Novi 领导战略合作伙伴关系，而 Ching 是 Novi 加密平台团队的首席软件工程师。\n\n他们的重点是创建“区块链”，同时又不推进一个“推进”的中心化[，](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-genesis-of-aptos-ff98d86e9445)从全球安全性和有效性[。](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-genesis-of-aptos-ff98d86e9445)这就是他们重在新组织的最初的“ [Diem的创造者、研究人员、设计师和创造者，这最初是为了实现这一目标而将人员组织到区块链上”。链](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-genesis-of-aptos-ff98d86e9445)”。\n\nAptos从亿加密和的最大参与者包括他们惊人的[2美元，a1crypto、Multicoin Capital、ParaFi、Haun Ventures、PayPal Ventures、ParaFi Ventures、Haun Ventures、6z Ventures等](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/aptos-labs-a16z-multicoin-facebook-diem-blockchain/)。[“独角兽”领域](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/aptos-labs-a16z-multicoin-facebook-diem-blockchain/)——即超过10亿美元。\n\n移动语言\n\n它是语言正在为 Aptos 提供的主要安全技术特性[Move的最初版本。](https://pontem.network/posts/how-the-move-programming-language-works)\n\n了解优势的关键是它对*资源的使用。*简而言之，资源是在系统中信息的一种高度保护的存储。架构中具有重要的方法代码，确保它们不会被复制或无意删除。\n\n移动重要将重要将信息（例如代币和智能合约）存储为资源，与实现的区块链编程语言比较，该语言的安全性大大提高。移动用于 Aptos 的所有关键元素，包括[账目交易、费用、标准库、验证节点管理和配置](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)。\n\n# 其他安全功能\n\n[Ap](https://pontem.network/posts/consensus-protocols-101)构建时考虑到性，因此除了直接编入Move中的功能之外，它还具有许多其他功能。 。\n\nAptos 共识协议被认为是拜占庭容错（BFT），指的是[拜占庭一般问题](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)。想象一下一群必须共同决定作战计划的将军。他们怀疑该组织中的某个人是叛徒并提供了虚假信息。他们的“困境”是如何在这些情况下制定计划。在去中心化区块链中，拜占庭一般问题是指参与者，尤其是[验证](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/blockchain-validator)者，他们必须努力正确地确认或拒绝交易，而不能隐含地相互信任。这是潜在的区块链漏洞利用的常见来源。\n\nAptos 的 BFT 协议使网络保持平稳运行，无论一个验证者的行为如何，同时也保持世界级的速度。Aptos 使用[信誉系统来更新验证者轮换并使用“](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00960)[起搏器](https://coinyuppie.com/understanding-the-new-public-chain-aptos-the-exodus-of-the-original-diem-team-rebuilding-the-public-chain/)”同步投票。该系统在不到一秒的时间内完全验证交易（通常称为“最终确定时间”的衡量标准），这[使其成为生产中最快的区块链之一](https://pontem.network/search?query=time+to+finality)。\n\nAptos 还具有许多功能，可保护最终用户的帐户免遭利用。[还记得那些因为忘记密钥而丢失加密货币](https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2021/07/10/a-cryptocurrency-trader-is-planning-a-massive-dumpster-dive-to-find-247-million-in-lost-bitcoin/)的用户的著名故事吗？Aptos[为密钥恢复构建了新的安全方法](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)，以及防止欺诈的密钥轮换系统。\n\n# 速度和可扩展性\n\nAptos 旨在成为面向未来的区块链，供个人和企业在世界各地使用。但要做到这一点，它需要具有世界级的速度。\n\n正如文章中的那样，区块链可以通过在一篇文章中的[方式来表达：每一种网络交易量（TPS）](https://pontem.network/posts/which-blockchain-is-the-fastest) F）。秒可以提交多少事务。 TTF 是指开始（例如向朋友的钱包发送交易加密货币）和交易生效（例如您的朋友可以在他们的这些代币中）之间的时间量。\n\n尽管 Aptos 仍处于测试网开发阶段，尚未完全投入运营，但它已经超越了竞争对手。其 TTF 不到 1 秒，在 Avalanche 和 Fantom 等超快链中名列前茅。[在合适的环境下，其 TPS 可以达到行业领先的 160,000 目前，该团队计划在短期内](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-evolution-of-state-sync-the-path-to-100k-transactions-per-second-with-sub-second-latency-at-52e25a2c6f10)达到10,000 TPS，并且正在朝着 100,000+ 的方向前进。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x0fjbhd4N0jPolvKkpIP8.png?height=987&width=1400)\n\nAptos 是如何加速魔梯功能的呢？\n\n首先，Aos将共识机制与执行管道连接进行。这意味着交易几乎可以组装线一样组织起来，共识和同时魔道执行同样的优化[。](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)这比共识机制安全验证的多轮[交易要快](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)。\n\n# 可扩展性\n\nAptos 将标号为“[最](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalability.asp)[安全和最多可扩展号的第 1 层链](https://aptoslabs.com/)”。，传统系统的趋势呈上升趋势[。](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalability.asp)组织，风险发生的事件越来越高。\n\nAptos 能够有这么多的需求并从链上运行，如何让系统正常运行，而不是在其他类型[的性能](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/solana-suffered-its-second-outage-in-a-month-sending-price-plunging.html)[上](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp)。Aptos 链上进行管理和验证者的类型非常简单。[Aptos 的测试使测试在](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)升级的下基础升级，并根据需要升级网络。\n\nAptos对[同步状态的用户是其他加速向中速的，这](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/the-aptos-vision-1028ac56676e)在通过其他交易区块链复制，添加验证了新的交易块，然后是网络Aptos的。同步协议非验证者同时发布这些数据，以确保确保确保确保生态系统中的每个人都同步。另外，一个操作可以使用[累累](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/developer-docs-site/docs/reference/glossary.md#merkle-accumulator)来网络同步节点。，而不是下载整个交易本。\n\n# 如今的Aptos\n\n除了为 Move 生态系统构建基础工具的 Pontem 之外，Aptos 还与其他公司合作以加速其发展。最有趣的之一是 Google Cloud，其[技术允许在 15 分钟内设置 Aptos 节点](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-labs-partners-with-google-cloud-to-enable-further-decentralization-of-the-aptos-network-f6eae47d4c65)。\n\nAptos 开发者测试网于 2022 年 3 月启动。它达到了 18,000 个完整活跃节点的峰值，使其成为当今最大的已知权益证明节点社区。激励性测试网的第一阶段在 5 月 24 日至 6 月 9 日期间运行，从 30,000 多份提交中仅选出了 100 名验证者。第一阶段取得了成功，有助于识别错误和漏洞并加强 Aptos 网络。", "timestamp": 1658556867, "digest":

Есть кое-что, чего мы еще не выяснили.\n\nВы видите это повсюду. В настоящее время для установления новых связей люди используют личные сообщения в Twitter, Discord и LinkedIn. Но из-за отсутствия эффективного управления идентификацией обычно заканчивается тем, что человек вообще не подключается или каждый день просыпается с почтовым ящиком, заполненным случайными сообщениями в личку и спамом. Распространенность мошенничества и отсутствие контекста еще больше подрывают доброжелательность, которую мы испытываем к тем, кто находится за экранами, оставляя нас с навязчивым чувством недоверия, которое душит потенциальные связи и сотрудничество. Это приводит к тяжелым последствиям со стороны безопасности: в США потери из-за кражи личных данных и связанных с этим мошенничеств выросли с 1,8 миллиарда долларов в 2019 году до 3,3 миллиарда долларов в 2020 году и 5,8 миллиарда долларов в 2021 году (FTC, 2022). Проблема по-прежнему продолжает быстро расти по мере того, как все большая часть нашей жизни переходит на цифровые технологии в ответ на глобальную пандемию.\n\n**Здесь нам не хватает чего-то фундаментального** *- сети не хватает слоя идентичности, который несет доверие и обогащен смыслом.*\n\nЦифровые идентификаторы, которые мы имеем в настоящее время, обычно не имеют измерений и в основном существуют только в виде идентификаторов, таких как записи номеров, на многих отдельных централизованных платформах. Для пользователей не существует простых способов проверки утверждений и атрибутов конкретного удостоверения, а также нет сети для обнаружения и реальной связи на веб-уровне.\n\nДецентрализованная сеть, которую мы создаем с помощью блокчейн-технологий, имеет большие перспективы в сокращении числа вредных посредников и облегчении индивидуального однорангового сотрудничества. И теперь мы выходим за рамки финансовых вариантов использования и раскрываем огромный потенциал децентрализованного общества. Но как именно мы решаем эту проблему доверия и смысла в идентичностях? И как мы обогащаем контексты целостной идентичности, выходящие за рамки записей транзакций?\n\n\n---\n\n## Представляем Link3\n\n***Link 3 - это социальная сеть Web 3 с поддающимися проверке личностями.***\n\n**Объединяя данные как внутри сети, так и вне сети, профили Link 3 служат целостными идентификаторами, обеспечивающими надежную сеть и значимые связи между пользователями и организациями.**\n\n*Link3 помогает вам укрепить доверие с помощью поддающихся проверке соединений и обогатить смысл идентичности контекстами.* В Web2 мы поддерживаем нашу публичную персону, подписываясь на людей, публикуя контент и самоутверждаясь всевозможными атрибутами и предпочтениями. Вдобавок ко всему, Link3 вводит новый набор измерений, которые рассказывают более достоверную и полную историю о том, кто вы есть:\n\n* **Cвязи**, которые у вас есть с другими людьми и организациями, независимо от платформ;\n* **Активы**, которыми вы владеете, которые соответствуют вашему статусу и вкусам;\n* **Учетные данные**, выданные третьими сторонами, такими как DAO и проекты, о ваших ключевых достижениях и ролях;\n* И все другие **записи о действиях в сети**, такие как голоса и пожертвования, которые подтверждают ваше участие в сообществах.\n\n**Эндогенный уровень доверия** вырастет из всех этих дополнительных измерений контекстов и значений, потому что они поддаются проверке.\n\nСостоящие из всех таких связей и записей, **реляционные идентичности**, подобные этим, являются органичными и развивающимися, подлинными и заслуживающими доверия, богатыми контекстом и значимыми, точно так же, как мы являемся социальными существами и хотели бы, чтобы все были в жизненно важных отношениях.\n\n\n---\n\n## Зачем именно вам нужен Link3?\n\n***Для пользователей*** с настроенным профилем Link3 предоставляется лучший способ для **надежного и значимого сетевого взаимодействия**. Благодаря более проверяемым параметрам, объединенным в вашем профиле, теперь у вас есть целостная личность, которая говорит правду о том, кто вы есть, и позволяет вам представить себя полным и достоверным образом. Продемонстрируйте свою принадлежность, учетные данные, активы и все другие записи в своем личном профиле и начните знакомство с сетью. Узнавайте и доверяйте кому-то мгновенно с помощью профиля Link3 в сети и без необходимости для верификации ссылок третьими лицами.\n\nКроме того, по мере создания контекстно-зависимых идентификационных данных и более значимых соединений сеть будет обладать **лучшей возможностью обнаружения**. Ожидайте, что к вам обратится больше людей, которые лучше понимают ваши сильные стороны, карьерные устремления, роль в обществе и личные вкусы. Также быстро найдите подходящего человека, к которому можно обратиться, и будьте уверены, что ваши запросы будут полностью переданы, поскольку профиль подкрепляет их.\n\nПеречислю несколько простых вариантов использования с некоторыми функциями, которые будут внедрены в ближайшем будущем:\n\n* Поделитесь своим профилем в специально разработанном формате визитной карточки, чтобы быстро продемонстрировать, кто вы и почему связи будут ценными.\n* Используйте свой профиль для подачи заявок и избавьтесь от всех ненужных процессов заполнения форм и отправки подтверждающих документов.\n* Ограничьте свою личную переписку чем-то большим, чем оплата или активы, и вместо этого пригласите тех людей с чертами характера, опытом и способностями, которые вы действительно цените.\n* Делегируйте свой голос людям, с которыми у вас есть значимые связи и которым вы действительно доверяете в отношении того, кем они являются в сообществе.\n\n***Для организаций и проектов*** Link3 может стать вашей универсальной ссылкой, которая поможет вашим подписчикам узнать о вас все в одном месте.\n\nОрганизационные профили Link3 **проверены и заслуживают доверия**. Чтобы защитить пользователей от мошенничества и поддельных ссылок, распространенных в Twitter и Discord, Link3 проверяет организации по их существующим официальным аккаунтам, таким как Twitter. Организации также могут связаться с другими авторитетными организациями и продемонстрировать это в разделах спонсоры / партнеры / команда. Позже организациям также будет разрешено выдавать поддающиеся проверке учетные данные или SBT, чтобы они могли распознавать ключевых участников сообщества. Структура доверия, состоящая из таких подключений и записей, обеспечивает надежность профилей Link3. Таким образом, пользователи будут уверены, что ссылки, по которым они переходят, и все полученные обновления являются официальными.\n\nПроекты, использующие Link3, также могут быть **лучше связаны с сообществом Web3**. Пользователи входят в систему с помощью кошельков, чтобы следить за проектами, и такие подключения основаны на адресах. Проекты могли бы создавать сообщества, ориентированные на Web3, и открывать возможность взаимодействовать с ними с помощью мероприятий, связанных с токенами, эйрдропов и многого другого.\n\n\n---\n\n## Разработано на CyberConnect\n\nLink3 построен поверх **децентрализованного протокола социального графа CyberСonnect** и будет вносить свой вклад в сеть передачи данных и механизм графа интересов. Link3 хранит всю информацию о профиле и подключениях **децентрализованным** и **независимым** образом.

{"id": "cdAt98i2OtsYqqp1FKGGPeUsgXbcdHG1Y9QxlLASoaA", "title": "MacOs + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

WB Montreal’s upcoming loot-focused beat ’em up won’t feature the Joker either, though Redding left the door open to Harley Quinn showing up and smashing a few things. \n \n\nBatman is in fact “really dead” Redding told a fan at the Q&A, *[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-joker-wont-be-in-gotham-knights)* [reports](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-joker-wont-be-in-gotham-knights) (via *[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-batman-is-really-dead-in-gotham-knights)*). This might seem obvious to some, since *Gotham Knights*’ reveal trailer shows the caped crusader getting blown up in the [starting minutes of the game](https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-nightwing-red-hood-ps4-xbox-one-canceled-1848905081). but WB’s Arkham games have been known for their stealthy twists and third-act reveals, leaving plenty of fans to speculate if the gravelly voiced detective would reappear before the end of the game. That turns out not to be the chase, however.\n\n#### Related Stories\n\n[PlayStation’s Summer Sale Includes Big Discounts On Star Wars, Assassin’s Creed, Batman](https://kotaku.com/playstation-summer-sale-best-ps4-ps5-star-wars-batman-1849321596)\n\n[Watch NowWhat You Should Know About Mario Striker's Big Free Update](https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-daisy-shy-guy-switch-1849319191)\n\n[Vince McMahon Finally Fires Himself, And It’s A Big Deal](https://kotaku.com/wwe-vince-mcmahon-retires-affair-investigation-fired-1849321433)\n\nThe Joker was another seeming mystery.

Once again, though, Redding laid any lingering speculation to rest. Harley Quinn, meanwhile, is still on the table. “I will not confirm or deny whether Harley is \\[in the game\\],” the director told fans. The Arkham Asylum psychiatrist turned supervillain turned frenemy is also one of the main protagonists of Rocksteady’s *Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League*, [due out next year](https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delayed-2023-warn-1848471378).\n\nWB Montreal\n\nWith *Gotham Knights* just a couple of months away from its October 25 release date, WB Montreal has also been liberally releasing new details and trailers, and its latest drop, compliments of SDCC, offers a brief glimpse into Batgirl’s character. “If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Gotham City it’s that people need symbols,” Barbara Gordon says before heading off into the night to knock some heads (the studio recently overhauled her backstory [following some controversy](https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-batman-batgirl-red-hood-nightwing-wb-gam-1848988700)).", "timestamp": 1658559237, "digest": "_-bXtMz3By4sHvp_8Ou8y2Lh9jNu7rCDagHMuI8fcrU", "contributor": "0x8b12ad955Dc874f293FAaC00169A41451617fD1c"}

Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS.

{"id": "6TyAbvfaZaxwk-H5L2uomzpCwnsLA-JHHiZxN0ACD6Q", "title": "MacOs + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS.

{"id": "-JDmBaxEVtnFMi5OA7ND7WDzvYBGF5YMZmfcDUEMEgs", "title": "MacOs + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

{"id": "_rpdGiEtdLbQZ45sR1M7L-sXil2V_pUquTGtGwCabwk", "title": "MacOS + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

Network State》](https://thenetworkstate.com/)的时机，1729社群又在酝酿新一轮的写作培训和比赛活动，而我也有幸被招募，负责课程设计、线上互动和经验分享等环节。和社群内的两位美国网友远程交流工作的这一个月，让我越来越相信Pieter Levels关于[「2035年全球将有10亿数字游民」](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/my-city-in-2022-cy-lisbon)的预测。\n\n以往我作为自由职业者都是单独作业，偶尔和客户联系下，剩下的时间我在哪个时区哪个国家都不重要。这会儿三个人在不同时区共同作业，其实也没有什么太大的不便，只要大家怀抱一个共同的愿景，工作起来也是流畅顺心。\n\n远程工作已经在欧美国家成主流，[DAO的崛起](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/creators-dao)更是起到推波助澜的作用。我从大企业离职三年有余，告别了多少曾经吐槽公司、老板和同事的负能量，从而让我有更多的时间和精力和喜欢的人一起做好玩的事儿。\n\n20多年前，一本名为[《主权个体The Sovereign Individual》](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720)的畅销书，为我们目前的数字生活时代定下了基调。书中首次提出了「主权个体」的概念，强调随着信息技术的发展，我们所处的社会阶层也将发生变化，而主权个体就是一个新的社会阶层。\n\n简单来讲，主权个体是可以摆脱地理位置的限制，在数字时代随时随地创造营收的一个群体。大多数人每天都过着一成不变的生活，在常规和习惯的作用下周而复始的过着每一天。但纵观历史你会发现，生活永远都是处于变动当中的，在不经意间缓慢地变化着，然后突然有一天产生了让我们大吃一惊的改变（gradually and then suddenly）。\n\n这些变化之所以很难被注意到，部分原因是因为主流媒体仍然引领着大众舆论，导致了单一且有导向性的叙事模式。但是互联网的诞生加速了信息的传播，部分人已经意识到大众传媒的弊端，他们主动打破信息和技术的壁垒，并因此从中受益，成为拥有自主权的个体。\n\n主权个体认为，勇于承担个人责任是通往自由和财富的道路。我们曾经处于一个标准化的社会，接受统一的教育，随大流高考/考研，进入大家公认的好单位，找到和你人生路基本相似的人，结婚生子，孩子继续重复这条道路... 这种标准化的生活方式让我们产生了依赖感，给了我们确定的道路和方向。但主权个体却不想将自己限制在这条看似为康庄大路的旅途上，他们通过主动寻求和筛选信息，跳出标准化的生活圈子，打造自己的游戏规则并建立杠杆，来实现财福双全的生活。\n\n他们不受民族和国家主义等意识形态的影响，而是名副其实的全球主义者。现在越来越多的工作可以在世界任何一个角落通过电脑来完成，对于主权个体来说，世界就是他们的游乐场，可以选择任何一个有利于他们发展的国家和地区，并打造多种收入来源，摆脱朝九晚五的限制。\n\n互联网本身已经形成了一个强大的经济体，并提供越来越多的沉浸式体验。主权个体可以利用互联网找到志同道合的人，不受地理位置限制联手合作开展项目（DAO），在数字环境中依靠智能合约达成协议，而不需要依靠当地政府的政策，从而实现多时区、多地区开拓收入来源，合理规避地缘政治的风险。\n\n看看今天社群内小伙伴的分享（下图），未来对于那些有理想有抱负的人来说总是充满着无限希望，勇敢地听从内心的引导去寻找属于你的社群，总会有一席之地供你闪亮！\n\n![Screenshot from the 1729 Discord community.](https://www.camelliayang.com/uploads/1/1/8/2/118233894/1729_orig.jpeg)\n\n## 创作者经济\n\n去年一直想参加[「创作者经济教母」](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/creator-economy-w)Li Jin的[线上课程](https://creatoreconomycourse.xyz/)，结果包括Spotify CEO在内的一众大佬都没排上号，当时默默地期待她能再开一次网课，未能如愿。\n\n最近Li Jin将她的网课免费向公众开放，虽然时隔一年有些内容已经过时，但绝大多数创作者经济相关联的底层逻辑总是万变不离其宗，简单总结一下我的学习笔记：\n\n\\- 如何定义「创作者」：有目的地创造可消费的内容，为自己和消费者创造价值；有影响力的人持续产出高质量的内容；数字时代的「邪教头目」，打造消费者可以产生共鸣的社群。\n\n\\- 纵观当前的创作者处境，Spotify上90%的流媒体播放版税给了前1.4%的音乐人，Twitch一半以上的营收都归于排名前1%的直播者，1%的主播囊括了大部分的播客广告收入。web2的互联网媒体模式压榨着绝大多数的创作者（尤其是中产创作者），使得他们的创作收益统统落入到平台的口袋中。\n\n\\- [a16z](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/va16zweb3)的创始人马克·安德森曾经提出过，互联网的原罪是没有将支付纳入其基础建设当中。这也解释了为什么web2盛行广告盈利的商业模式，与其让用户掏出信用卡付款，不如将他们的注意力变现。\n\n于是平台凭借着庞大的用户基数，利用算法控制着内容的创作和传播，将浏览量输送到已经备受欢迎的内容创作者那里。用户偏好和行为数据是平台最宝贵的资产，因此平台采取了封闭的生态系统，将用户锁定在自己的网络中，以便最大化收集这些专有数据。\n\n\\- 创作者在web2模式下不得不向广告商妥协，创造更能吸引眼球并带来流量的内容。这种模式不会激发创造小众而深入的内容，而是病毒式泛大众化的浅薄内容。\n\n以平台为中心、以广告为动力的商业模式是web2成功的关键，但是web3技术的诞生赋予了创作者更大的权利，并通过四大途径（NFT创造稀缺性、 用户/关注者成为投资人、有迹可循的新经济模式、 DAO和社区所有权）使创作者可以脱离平台的限制，直接建立与关注者和用户的关系。\n\n\\- 就像创业时需要找到产品和市场（PMF）的契合点，创作者也需要需要找到Creator-Market Fit，这时候需要考虑三个因素：商业模式、内容范围和受众。在探索商业模式时，需要回答几个问题（创作内容的动机、创作内容的平台、关注者的分类、内容种类、内容创造-变现的阶段、内容分发和推广平台）。\n\n\\- web2并没有一套奖励和跟踪机制系统，给予每一位参与创作的人应有的认可。而web3则解决了这个问题，以早期的Mirror和Foundation的分红功能为例，可以将收益自动分配给对该项目和作品有贡献的以太坊地址。\n\n互联网本身就是一个大熔炉，创作者们通过重混和合作的方式不断地产出内容并创造价值，这个曾经无法被量化和金融化的过程，如今借助技术可以统统实现，从而为创作者提供了更大的创作动力。每个链上项目和创意作品都有记录，创作者对其作品的后续使用也会获得相应的收益。\n\n\\- 创作者最大的焦虑：心理层面、算法层面和财务层面。创作者们最耗费心力的事情：寻找适合的工具和平台，寻找投资人获得增长。\n\n\\- 投资人在投资创作者时看重哪几个方面？创作者-市场契合度、有没有找到利基市场、是否为自己和消费者同时创造价值、增长趋势和盈利模式。投资人获取收益的方式：ISA、股份、代币、NFTs和借贷。\n\n\\- 现在最超前的那一部分人在周末所做的事情，就是普通人即将在未来十年从事的相关工作。现在孩子们热衷做的事情和项目，就是未来创作者会集中创作的东西。\n\n\\- 在过去的十年间，我们生活在一个内容所有权掌控在少数平台的环境里，这些平台拥有着我们的数据，操纵着创作者与用户的关系，并压榨着创作者的价值。虽然用户生产的内容迎来了一波又一波爆炸式的增长，但我们还是受限于算法和不正当激励机制的影响，绝大多数的创作者更不可能单凭创作内容谋生。\n\n幸运的是，我们正处于互联网复兴的起点，借助web3的技术将把我们带向一个真正的内容为王的黄金时代。\n\n*P.S.

如果你想要有安全感的生活，那你其实并不真的热爱生活。\n\n有安全感的生活是按照别人写好的剧本进行彩排。\n\n如果你能清晰地看到自己的人生轨迹，那并不是真正的人生，而是社会和环境强加给你的东西。\n\n人生就像穿越一条长长的隧道，看不到尽头且伴随着焦虑，而我们能做的就是把一路勇敢无畏前进的行动当做是自愿的行为，参与并体验整个过程。\n\n你的人生只有最后回顾时才能知晓。\n\n3\\. 克里希那穆提写道，学习自己是一件极其困难的事，因为自己处于持续不断的运动之中。要学习活生生的东西，你不得不每一分钟都以全新的视角来观察它和学习它。\n\n自己是一个活生生的实体，而不是一样已死的东西，这个活生生的东西必须得到观察。此外，你必须放下在这一分钟内所学到的有关你自己的知识，然后在下一分钟重新学习，以至于你一直都在以全新的视角来学习一个活生生的东西。\n\n[导师汤姆·摩根](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/21-useful-ideas-1-big-one-cn)也说过，我们追求的持续流动的平衡状态可以称之为「道」。可悲的是，这种平衡的状态却永远无法用精确的语言来阐述，因为一旦我们这样做了，「道」便被定义为静止的状态，这与「道」的定义相违背。\n\n认识自我的最好方式便是进入一种完全自发的无意识状态，与生命共舞实现流动的状态。你需要倾听自己的内心去找到实现这种状态的方法，没人能手把手教你，也不会靠模仿得来，全凭自己的感觉和体验。\n\n4\\. 今年三月份发现了一家聚焦[图书NFT的网站BookCoin](https://www.bookcoin.com/)，我很喜欢的博主[Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/)是该网站的顾问和参与方，并将其畅销书的金句做成了NFT在此网站发行。\n\n拥有Mark NFT的读者可以解锁图书未出版的章节，加入他的独家俱乐部和线上课程等。\n\n最近BookCoin又开始玩Read to earn模式，读者购买NFT之后可以在线阅读经典小说《The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde》，通过回答一系列和书籍内容有关的问题后，有机会获得限量版的NFT。感兴趣的可以研究下！\n\n\n---\n\nIf you love

{"id": "RRDGzOVosxO3BtGeJRid_gMWl1EOjFw22yhkULrkhdE", "title": "新手必学——Discord使用及撸毛指引", "body": "Twitter和Discord是了解加密货币项目和进入社区必备的两个软件，可以说，不会使用它们，甚至连撸空投的门都还没摸着。twitter的使用较为简单，基本不用了解就能上手，但是discord功能较为复杂，这里给大家做了一个快速指引，希望大家能够立刻上手，撸到大毛。\n\n## 一.Discord是什么\n\nDiscord最初是主要是面向游戏玩家的一个社区群聊通讯软件，与其他只有群聊和点对点通讯的聊天软件不同，Discord更像是集成了百度贴吧的群聊软件。\n\n由于Discord带有丰富的功能和拓展性，所以十分适合用来搭建项目方自己的社区，目前基本所有正经的项目方都会在discord上建立自己的社区，方便与社区成员沟通交流。\n\n[微软花120亿美金都高攀不起的Discord，到底有什么魔力？](https://www.163.com/dy/article/HAS91NK60511805E.html)\n\n[微软花120亿美金都高攀不起的Discord，到底有什么魔力？,微软,游戏,群组](https://www.163.com/dy/article/HAS91NK60511805E.html)\n\n[www.163.com](https://www.163.com/dy/article/HAS91NK60511805E.html)\n\n## 二.使用discord\n\n### 1.安装/插件\n\n首先我们从官网下周Discord。无论在什么时候，都一定要从官方网站安装软件，保护设备安全。\n\n[Discord | Your Place to Talk and Hang Out](https://discord.com/)\n\n[Discord is the easiest way to talk over voice, video, and text. Talk, chat, hang out, and stay close with your friends and communities.](https://discord.com/)\n\n[discord.com](https://discord.com/)\n\n打开软件后按照要求注册，这跟大多数app的注册是一样的，这里就不赘述了。\n\n由于大多数项目方都是使用英文交流的，所以可以自行安装一个翻译插件，这是第三方工具，可能存在一些风险，DYOR\n\n[【实用帖】手把手教你安装Discord翻译插件](https://mirror.xyz/0x7471e603a5e90136d678C919884048B227f5ba5D/6OaA9z8ae-2YVuCl5Jsl6N5SSdjvKf4nZAleoKalrGM)\n\n[mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/0x7471e603a5e90136d678C919884048B227f5ba5D/6OaA9z8ae-2YVuCl5Jsl6N5SSdjvKf4nZAleoKalrGM)\n\n### 2.进入discord\n\n如上图所示，进入discord后会看到这样一个界面：\n\n* **左侧红框区域为服务器列表**。这里的服务器不是我们平时说的机房里面的那种服务器，你可以理解为项目方自行建立的不同的论坛。\n* **黄框区域为服务器中的各个频道**。频道由服务器管理者自行设立，不同的频道有不同的功能。\n* **蓝框区域是个人设置选项**。点击自己的头像可以切换账号，点击名字可以直接复制自己的账号，注意每个人的账号后面还附带了一串数字，如果没有带上数字直接将账号告诉别人，是找不到你的，右侧的齿轮即设置选项，大多数功能可以不用管，但是可以定期查看一下已授权的app，防止无意中授权给了恶意app\n* **绿框区域是聊天界面**。\n* **白框区域是所在频道的人员列表**。点击人员头像可以看到他在服务器中的身份。身份可以说是discord的核心，下面也会详述。\n\n定期查看授权app是一个好习惯\n\n不同服务器需要使用链接或者discord内的朋友邀请才能进入，比如这样打开这个链接就能进入@AirdropToYou社区：[discord.gg/zFHwbfasdj](http://discord.gg/zFHwbfasdj)\n\n正经的项目方为了防止机器人大量涌入，会设置一个验证通道，进入Discord后，你一般只能看到verification频道，有的验证方式是点一下✅表情，有的需要点击Verify跳转到第三方验证网站，有的可能会通过私信（DM）给你发一个链接进行验证。\n\n点击Verify验证后才能进入服务器\n\n完成验证后就能看到大多数的频道了，有的服务器会需要关联你的钱包，这时你能找到Collab频道，进入后按照类似的方法给你的钱包签名。不用担心，collab是一个值得信任的项目，不存在安全问题。\n\n完成两项验证以后，首先要看的是服务器的公告了解整个服务器和项目的进展，一般项目方会在announcement/公告频道中公告所有内容，官方相关的链接会放在official-links中，还有一些，每进入一个频道都有一个钉注信息区域，频道中比较重要的内容会被放在这里，每次进入频道都应首先查看。\n\n添加的服务器太多后，会有巨量的通知信息，如果嫌太吵闹，可以点击服务器上方的小三角，关掉所有的消息通知。\n\n## 三.利用Discord撸毛\n\n### 1.拿身份\n\n身份是玩家在服务器中地位的象征，社区创建者除了给初创团队一些管理身份外，往往还会赋予早期玩家一个OG身份，对于那些擅长交流沟通、愿意为社区付出的志愿者也会给予Moderator（即我们常说的mod）身份，mod拥有禁言、踢人等许多管理权限。\n\n在Alps Finance社区中能看到各种各样的角色\n\n**在许多项目中，获得的身份越稀有，未来空投获得的代币也就越多。例如：**\n\n* **HOP**：0.1% 给前 500 名 Hop Discord 参与者和 79 名推特用户，他们是 Hop 的早期传播者\n* **ENS**：25% 给 ENS 贡献者（> 100 个个人和团体，加上数百名 Discord 用户）\n* **Swivel**：1% 属于经过验证的Discord 社区贡献者（经过验证的反馈和内容）\n\n因此，在DC中是否能够拿到重要的role身份，与你所能获得的空投量息息相关。\n\n**这里列举了几种拿到role的方法，供大家参考：**\n\n* **早期加入**：新项目刚开张的时候，OG（Original gangster）身份是比较容易拿的角色，在dc中人还不多的时候及时进入，完成一些任务即可获得。我曾经在推特多次推荐一些较优质的早期项目，及时进入都能获得OG。\n* **肝等级**：一般在社区中聊天越多，等级也会越高，相应也能获得不同的身份，Jambo是一个获得大量融资的非洲社交项目，现在去肝聊天，后期说不定就会得到不错的福报。如果决定肝等级的话一定要考察好项目，有的项目聊天机器人很多，项目方如果没仔细运营踢掉机器人的话，你会跟机器人内卷，那就得不偿失了。\n* **做任务**：一些项目如Singularity、Crypoto Maze会不定时发布一些任务，完成后就能获得积分或者角色。一些社区内的AMA也是可以多参加参加的，\n* **贡献**：普通人虽然无法完成开发工作，但是项目方往往会需要翻译，其实翻译的重点不在于英文有多好，借助DeelMind翻译工具，你可以直接获得一篇成色不错的英译中文章，最后所需要做的就是把语句改的更通顺，前段时间像OP、zkSync这样的大项目都一直需要翻译的，现在情况不太清楚，但是大家可以自行挖掘。\n\n### 2.套磁\n\n有些项目虽然不是很优质，但是项目方会比较好说好，这时你不一定要去混角色，多跟官方负责人或者管理员套磁聊天，说不定就能拿到一些白名单或者特别的信息。这个就完全考验个人的交际能力了。\n\n这里做个小广告，我们@AirdropToYou 社区目前正在招募宣发组，如果你有不错的交际能力，可以考虑加入我们社区，以宣发组的身份去跟项目方套磁，说不定能拿到更多的支持。\n\n[ \n ](https://discord.com/invite/zFHwbfasdj)", "timestamp": 1658561241, "digest": "sbrNSA_-i2O5YY7dbUWwBdry01WUx7tXpe6gdeFbuS4", "contributor": "0xa040B1D96957fC608C5801B2Aee9eF2d349334bB"}

Google Threat Analysis Group leader Shane Huntley [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1545449555231010816), “Blocking Office macros would do infinitely more to actually defend against real threats than all the threat intel blog posts.”\n\nNow the new default setting is rolling out, but with updated language to alert users and administrators what options they have when they try to open a file and it’s blocked. This only applies if Windows, using the NTFS file system, notes it as downloaded from the internet and not a network drive or site that admins have marked as safe, and it isn’t changing anything on other platforms like Mac, Office on Android / iOS, or Office on the web.\n\n**[Microsoft:](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/helping-users-stay-safe-blocking-internet-macros-by-default-in/ba-p/3071805/page/2)**\n\n> We’re resuming the rollout of this change in Current Channel.

第一节 引言\n\n如今电脑、手机等电子设备占据着生活生产大部分的时间，而软件作为电子屏幕中人际关系最重要的接口，扮演了非常重要的角色。电脑与智能手机的液晶屏幕背后，软件的世界变得越来越复杂而庞大。当今的生活生产形式在二十几年间，几乎已经被电子屏中的软件彻底颠覆了。软件这样一个虚拟世界似乎是一个平行的空间，给我们看世界的眼睛悄悄戴上了一幅眼镜。\n\n自从钻木取火开始，人类的进化就始终与工具的使用密不可分。当今世界普遍认为我们即将迎来新的技术革命，21世纪的技术被认为具备了智慧的可能性。在2018年的谷歌I/O大会上，谷歌董事长曾宣布他们的语音助手Duplex已经在商务领域通过了图灵测试。当天Duplex在大会上的演示确实为世人震惊，一时引发广泛讨论。然而没过多久就有人爆料称Duplex的语音服务有部分是人工代替。虽然事实的真像扑朔迷离，但诸如AlphaGo等智能产品的成功足以让人们担心或相信通过图灵测试的智能机器即将到来。于是诸如机器取代人类的言论铺天盖地，人们似乎并没有对技术的进一步进化做足充分的思想准备。\n\n这些恐慌都起源于人们的技术工具论思想。而软件作为当今信息技术最重要的载体，化身为各式各样的“工具”，嵌入进我们生活生产的方方面面。但是当我们使用这些软件工具的时候，却并不能引起“技术取代我们”的情绪。这其中的原因不仅仅是因为“锤子”不如“Duplex”先进，我们可能更因该思考他们之间的共性。正是基于这样的背景，我试图考察软件在使用的过程中，是如何中介着人与世界的关系。对软件操作如何影响我们感知事物的研究，或许也许可以帮助我们理解自身与技术之间的关系问题。本研究将聚焦于软件操作带来的一些认知惯性如何影响我们的在现实生活中的感知。\n\n### 第二节 研究目标与意义\n\n当今世界的电子技术与信息技术已成为生产生活最重要的基础设施，而软件作为人与电子实体的中间层，决定了我们日常生活形式的方方面面。研究人与软件交互中带来的知觉层面的影响，将可以为人与技术的关系的思考与艺术实践提供有价值的灵感与养分。\n\n本文受限于篇幅和作者的知识背景，将侧重在对功能性软件奥多比系列和社交软件抖音的交互的具体情境进行分析。并结合相关艺术案例，来探讨软件自身的交互逻辑是如何作用于人，艺术家们又该如何回应？\n\n### 第三节 人与技术的关系\n\n柏拉图早在《斐徳罗篇》中就有对书写作为一种记忆技术的思考。书写在拓展我们记忆能力的同时，是否使我们失去了记忆的能力呢？这种技术的二重性也体现在希腊神话中，爱比米修斯在给万物分发能力的时候遗漏了人类，普罗米修斯为了弥补他的过失为人类偷来了火种。然而在人类享用“火”这一技术的同时，普罗米修斯不得不替人类日夜受罚。这些古老的思想和传说显示出技术的进步始终伴随着痛楚，并且人类总是遗忘技术诞生的原始起因。 海德格尔在其演讲录《技术的追问》中专门讨论过技术的本质的问题。人们通常对技术的看法是将工具与其发展的目的的分离的，技术是人的行为，其本身是中立的。然而海德格尔认为技术演化发展的背后，隐含着一种将一切自然之物变为有待备用的“持存物”的本质。人在发明和使用技术的同时，获得了一种自由假象。而这种对技术的起源之遗忘，也导致了认为技术仅仅是达到目的的手段这样一种工具论的认识。\n\n唐·伊德在《技术与生活世界》这本书中，将人与技术的关系放在一个图形与背景/生物与环境/宏观知觉与微观知觉的框架下来审视。基于此他为人与技术的关系提出了一个四象限的框架。他认为人与技术的关系分为具身关系（embodiment relations）、诠释学关系(hermeneutic relations)、它异关系（alterity relations）和背景关系(background relations)。“具身关系”是一种非常切身的与技术的关系。例如眼镜和视觉的关系，是“我以一种特殊的使用方式将技术融入我的经验中”的情景，唐·伊德用“（人-技术）→世界”的意向图式来表示。“诠释学关系”是技术成为了我们理解世界的中介，因为技术我们才对世界获得了某种认知。比如说因为有了温度计我们才知道现在的温度是多少，意向图式为“人→（技术-世界）”。“它异关系”是技术成为了一个准它者（quasi-other）。唐·伊德用ATM机来举例，意向图式为“人-技术-（-世界）”。第四种关系是 “背景关系”。此时技术从具体的使用中隐去，成为一种背景。比如无线网络这样的技术，我们在使用它的时候感受不到它的存在，只有断网的时候才能体会到它。\n\n这些关系不是割裂的而是同时交叉存在于人与技术的关系中。唐·伊德认为人在与技术交互时，技术同时兼备一种“放大-简化”人的能力的作用，就如同望远镜延伸了我们的视觉极限，但同时也将我们的认识简化到了纯视觉的范围内。某种程度上，这也呼应了海德格尔的技术同时解蔽/遮蔽了世界的观点，并重新以生活世界的视角来解释。这种辩证的二重性并不同于通常人们所说的“技术是把双刃剑”。“双刃剑”的理论仍然是将目的与手段分裂开的想法，否认了技术与人的互相形塑的本质。唐伊德的分析是将人与技术放在一个生存论的关系中来思考的，我认为唐伊德着重生活世界的经验分析有利于在实践层面上来面对人与技术的本质这一问题，特别是在艺术实践的角度颇有启发。\n\n### 第四节 软件与界面（接口）\n\n计算机作为一种只能读取“0/1”这种电位信号的计算设备，为了提高操作效率，人类发明了各种更容易理解的符号语言来对计算机输入指令以代替去直接操作电路面板。这些符号语言发展到当今，已经变得非常“高级”或者说“用户友好”。比如更接近自然语言的“高级编程语言”以及“图形用户界面”。虽然诸如编程语言的“if…else”或者图形界面的“点击”、“拖拽”行为，看起来如此自然，容易理解，但实际上，这只不过是经由工程师将电位级别的指令规则层层抽象之后形成的一个幻象。软件就是这样一个相对于计算机底层逻辑操作的抽象的隐喻，以人类高效操作计算机为目的，并且独立于具体的硬件。\n\n如果我们将这样一座层层抽象的“巴别塔”剖开来看，每一层都可比作上一层的“软件”，编程语言之下有编译器/解释器、编译器/解释器之下有汇编语言、汇编语言之下有机器码以及指令集等等。而被工程师称为“用户（user）”的图形界面使用者，则处在这条如俄罗斯套娃一般，自相似递归链条的最末端。虽然从本质上来看，每一层都可以称作相对于上一层的软件，但作为使用者的“用户（user）”和作为书写者/定义者的“开发者（developer）”是不同的。开发者为用户开发界面/接口（interface），用户通过界面/接口使用硬件；开发者拥有比用户更多的定义权和知情权，用户更加被动地通过界面/接口的隐喻来理解计算机；开发者通过书写来与计算机沟通，用户通过对视觉符号联想来操作计算机。作为开发者的“书写”是一个大的话题，而本篇文章则侧重讨论用户与界面/接口的交互现象。虽然界面/接口不仅仅指代软件中的界面，在硬件中也存在，比如说一个耳机的插孔在英文中也被称为interface（接口）。但在中文的语境里界面通常和接口有所区分，界面更多的是虚拟的图形界面，比较相近的英文概念是图形用户界面（Graphic User Interface）。而在当今世界的生活中，图形用户界面涵盖了人们使用软件的绝大多是场景，因此本片文章的重点也是放在了对图形用户界面的分析上。\n\n## 第二章 软件操作的两个情景\n\n### 第一节 计算机辅助绘图\n\n#### **知识经验与日常经验**\n\n手掌以下两个手指的地方，也叫寸口，是长度单位。当我们想要找出正确的垂直线的时候，我们用线吊起一个重物，地心引力给手施加的压力感，以及有关万有引力的知识，让你有信心认为这根线一定是垂直指向地面的。这些“原始”的测量活动中，身体的感知必不可少。然而科学与理性的发展，让我们的脑海中多了一些超越经验范畴的知识。在墨家的《经》与欧几里得的《几何原本》中对“线”的描述有相似的地方。“端，体之无厚而最前者也”（《经》，墨子），“端，是无间”（《经说》），“点是没有的部分”（《几何原本》，欧几里得）。这些几何的概念让我们对事物的尺度具备了一种极限的认知与感悟。随着计算机辅助设计（CAD）等相关的工具软件的诞生，“点”、“线”、“面”这些原本抽象且极限的概念，在电脑中却可以以一种数学与视觉的方式显现。不仅如此，这些辅助工具还预置了让我们的设计更加完美高效的程序。比如贝塞尔曲线、B样条等算法，会根据我们实际绘制的折线，预测并描画出具有极高精度的平滑曲线。从那时开始，那些超出我们身体经验之外的精确与完美的形式，已经内化到我们的直觉中了。\n\n在人使用工具的过程中，基于科学的软件工具的发明，将那些数学几何的认知方式嵌入到了我们的身体意识当中。使得我们观察和绘图的过程中，添加了一个中间层。计算机辅助绘图软件就是这样一种中间层，下面将会以奥多比的绘图软件为例来讨论计算机辅助绘图中的人机交互关系。\n\n#### **奥多比公司的绘图工具**\n\n与计算机绘图软件起始与伊万·萨瑟兰（Ivan Sutherland）的一篇博士论文《画板》（sketchpad）（1963）。 画板（sketchpad）被认为是计算机辅助设计（CAD)的始祖。在还没有鼠标和键盘这些现代电脑标配的交互套件的时代，画板（sketchpad）这套系统就具备了非常流畅的电脑绘图交互。画板（sketchpad）可以通过“光笔”（一种光敏输入设备），可以在屏幕上绘制几何图形。并且对几个图形的各部分属性可以进行任意改动。复制、粘贴、长度修改、对齐、对称、夹角度数等等几何性质都可以精确控制，并且可以在有限的屏幕尺寸内，无线的放大和缩小图形。这项发明在当时是非常突破性的，伊万·萨瑟兰（Ivan Sutherland）博士被认为是人机交互（HCI）学科的开创人，绘图程序sketchpad的图形用户界面和面向对象的编程方法被认为是计算机图形学的重大突破。实际上，Sutherland博士凭借这篇论文成功获得了1988年的图灵奖。也正是这一年，奥多比（Adobe）公司的Illustrator桌面绘图软件正是发布了。\n\n图 1 Sketchpad， 1963\n\n《画板》（sketchpad）作为第一个图形用户界面和第一个交互式绘图程序，影响了后面的许多重要软件，奥多比的Illustrator（Adobe Illustrator）就是其中发展最好的软件之一。奥多比（Adobe）公司创始人约翰·沃诺克（John Warnock）在Evans and Sutherland公司工作的时候（Ivan Sutherland和Evans创办的著名的计算机图形公司）开始了PostScript编程语言的想法。这个技术后来成为了奥多比（Adobe）公司早期的核心技术。苹果公司的乔布斯看中奥多比（Adobe）公司的技术，并用在了苹果与佳能合作的激光打印机LaserWrite上。自从1988年Adobe Illustrator在麦金塔电脑上发布开始，电脑绘图和数字打印输出就完美的结合起来了。桌面绘图软件Illustrator，苹果麦金塔电脑和鼠标键盘，佳能的激光打印机。这一整套的工作流水线，颠覆了传统绘图和印刷出版的模式，开创了以电脑和打印机为中心的桌面出版的模式。而奥多比（Adobe）系列软件也成为了现代平面设计不可或缺的必备工作套件。从那时开始，设计绘图就从尺规手绘变成了用鼠标在屏幕上调整贝塞尔曲线。这样的模式，一直延续到现在。\n\n在前文中我们已经提到过，几何的知识，让我们具备了超越日常经验之上的认知。而这些从墨子和欧几里得发源的几何的理性知识，经由现代科学的演化，逐渐具体化成为了屏幕中的操作界面。Illustrator工具栏上琳琅满目的工具图标，虽然有着具象化的，甚至是拟物风格的图标，让你产生对生活世界中的铅笔、钢笔等工具的联想认知，但实际上他们千差万别。\n\n在Illustrator中所有的曲线绘制都是基于贝塞尔曲线算法的。当你试图用AI Illustrator）画点儿什么，即使你使用最简单的铅笔功能，Illustrator都会直接用贝塞尔的曲线对这条路径进行重新绘制。然后你可以用“直接选择”工具来调整每一个控制点。这条重绘的曲线损失了一些原作者的精确细节，但它使线条变得更完美、更符合标准的工业流程。它增强了我们对形状和线条的控制力。而复制、平移、翻转、镜像、透视变形、风格笔刷等等，更加增强了这一属性。正如Illustrator 1.0上市使用的品牌形象《维纳斯的诞生》（波提切利）一样，“让你创造完美的曲线”是Illustrator的立足之本。\n\n绘画是们古老的艺术，心、手和眼的密切配合中有着很多不可分割的相互作用过程，这决定了电脑辅助绘图将是一个高度具身化的技术。在与计算机绘图软件的发展中，数位绘画板应运而生。值得一提的是。数位板的发明实际上远早于绘图程序、乃至计算机的发明。早在1888年，伊莱莎·格雷（Elisha Gray）就发明了电传笔（如图表6），可以被认为是在电报时代用来签名的机器。现代的数位笔，如和冠(Wacom)数位笔，与其技术形式是十分相似的，他们都是将人工轨迹转换成电信号传输到电子系统来。只不过现代数位笔的无线无源技术，采用一种更自然，巧妙的技术形式。如和冠(Wacom)的数位笔使用电磁场来进行电子笔的状态探测，无需供电，就可以将笔的倾斜、压感等信息传递给电脑。使电子绘图的体验进一步逼近真实的纸笔绘图。\n\n数位板、数位笔与奥多比系列软件整合起来的数位出版工作方式，提高了出版物生产的效率，同时也促成了出版图画的新的时尚。用Illustrator绘制的图形既漂亮美观，又能高效产出，迅速风靡。电脑绘图的“自然化”实际上是唐·伊德意义上技术的具身化的加强，技术更好的化身为了人类的能力的一部分，变得更加透明化。这也使得人在使用工具的时候更不觉得工具的存在，与此同时，人的技术带来的感知能力也更加内化为人的感知。使用者可以画出更完美的曲线，更精准的造型，更完美的重复与按比例变化的细节。\n\n技术的透明度一方面让技术本身“抽身而去”，使用者在绘制的过程中忘记了工具的存在，另一方面让我们相信并依靠自己被增强的技能。绘图软件中种类繁多的微自动功能，给绘图者形象思维中植入了数学的模型。这些来自工具的逻辑不断内化到使用者的行为和想象中。\n\n谷歌人工智能实验室的日本员工在其网站上发布一个书写汉字的小实验Kanji-rnn。该实验使用了具有短期记忆的神经网络模型，通过大量将汉字的路径喂给模型，他就可以形成一个对汉字结构的模糊概念。在这个项目的线上互动展示项目上，你可以通过鼠标输入汉字的部分笔画，Kanji-rnn会实时地预测接下来的笔画，完成汉字书写。虽然这个项目并没有什么特别的研究目标，仅仅是为了实验模型的可能性。该模型只是借用表面的字形模式，并没有真正理解汉字的字形组成的内涵意义。但是类似通过路径预测的方式，如果放在警方判断犯罪行为上，则可以形成强有力的决策行为。实际上这样的方法已经发生在了现实之中。而这些更具自主性的数学模型与AI中为自动化的路径预测有着同源的亲近关系。\n\n在Illustrator的使用情景中，使用者不仅仅是通过软件来完成自己的工作，同时也在软件提供的功能框架下，逐渐形成了与软件相互镶嵌的技巧与艺术语言。软件并不是中立的，软件实际参与了绘图方法甚至设计方式的建立。在这一直觉关系中，软件不仅具有具身性，同时也有它异性。具身性增强了控制几何元素的能力，同时也将使用者的心与手的可能性简化到了数学模型的范围。而繁多且不断完善的微自动功能，也让软件具有了某种能动性， 亦即主体性。\n\nIllustrator软件是计算机辅助绘图中的一种，作为奥多比（Adobe）公司的头号产品之一，如今非常密切的参与着平面类型的创意图形的输出，包括平面设计、插画、二维动画等。作为艺术创意领域的辅助设计软件，相比如工业领域的诸如AutoCAD、犀牛等软件来说，Illustrator的软件逻辑和操作使用相对来说更加人性化，或者说有更好的“用户体验”。在界面设计领域，当说一个软件有比较好的用户体验的时候，一般是认为这个软件使用起来有比较低的学习门槛和比较直觉化的操作逻辑。“较低的学习门槛”可以被认为是软件的各部分功能和使用逻辑与用户在现实世界的经验有更多的重合。“更符合直觉的使用逻辑”是指软件的使用方法能够最大效率地是通过界面的暗示传达给用户。就使用者的感受来说，会让人感觉软件更好“上手”，觉得很好用。\n\n软件技术不仅仅是中立的工具和手段。在人与软件的交互过程中，技术依循自身的逻辑，或改造、或扩充我们的知觉，同时也选择性的简化某些认知能力。软件的自身逻辑，是其发展中的它异化的体现，逐渐发展为具有主体性的关系。在推动技术发展的过程中，我们应该密切关注技术给我们带来的影响，从而更好的让技术和我们成为合作者的而关系，而不是反噬或对立。\n\n### 第二节 抖音App的体验闭环\n\n互动体验设计是网联网产品设计的一个专业领域，其核心目标是如何使软件产品更好用。但这样的目标在一些免费的产品中，却显得有悖其初衷。从利益或者说从根本上的商业逻辑上来考虑，用户和流量就是金钱。所以免费软件的经营者和产品经理们不得不绞尽脑汁的来拉拢近的用户并促进用户活跃度，行话称其为“拉新”和“促活”。在这样的大背景下，被称为用户的软件使用者们，行为上瘾在所难免。免费的软件实际上并不免费。\n\n免费经济带来的软件沉迷是值得反思和探讨的，在这一章中我讲探讨抖音app为例，来探讨社交类软件是如何构建起不断吸引用户使用的体验闭环的。\n\n#### **那些欲罢不能的功能**\n\n在社交类的软件的互动设计中，有许多让人“上瘾”的功能，比如facebook发明的点赞，youtube的自动播放下一条视频，app来新消息时的小红点，粉丝量，等等。者每一项发明的背后几乎有着心理学的原理，利用人们的心理弱点，来让用户不假思索地产生行动。著名学者普林斯顿心理学博士亚当 · 阿尔特（Adam Alter）曾提出了“行为上瘾”的概念，并列举了行为上瘾的六项相关构成要素，分别是：\n\n1. 诱人的目标\n2. 无法抵挡且无法预知的积极反馈\n3. 渐进改善的感觉\n4. 越来越困难的任务\n5. 需要解决却暂未解决的紧张感\n6. 强大的社会联系\n   抖音则全部满足了以上要求。如自动推荐的内容，让用户始终无法预知下一个视频的内容，始终保持好奇、滑动屏幕的时候自动播放、15秒配有动感音乐的短视频与自动播放、和点赞社交的激励。其中功能大多都有相应的神经学或者脑科学的理论的成果支持。如间歇性变量奖励（自动推荐）、先于理智的音乐与视觉刺激（自动播放）、蔡格尼克记忆效应（Zeigarnik effect）（15秒视频的意犹未尽）等等。基于抖音软件的音乐短视频的内容和其产品理念“记录美好生活”，抖音在基于以上设计之中主要强化的了沉浸式瀑布流的交互形式，接下来我将主要分析抖音主界面的瀑布流交互。", "timestamp": 1658562727, "digest": "IQWHeAmue_yqt5PVSwtOf5eEKcN6lG7MubslmE8UA5c",

The European Union has pledged to[ reduce its Russian gas consumption by 66%](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/18/energy/europe-repower-plan-russian-energy/index.html) before next year, and break its dependence completely by 2027.\n\n* \n\nOn Wednesday, the bloc unveiled its emergency gas rationing plan which sets a target for member states to reduce their gas demand by 15% between August and March next year.\n\n— *Nadine Schmidt contributed reporting.*", "timestamp": 1658562721, "digest": "LDiQZTo4_o8oNYmIb48waplDk8akeavuSWFkaz1aYC8", "contributor": "0xBCFf79e650DcAe9A9fb61AC0Adf39ff3C901610c"}

{"id": "rdPqYq3bsMsNXj8ekjEXXo51rBb3-kvx1ezHoYWzp8E", "title": "周末情绪和价格仍保持窄幅震荡 宏观情况尚未出现明显变化 — 2022.7.23", "body": "当前总结：从美股闭盘后BTC和ETH就开始了一路上涨，到目前将近下午14点，依然是在震荡上行的趋势，从现在的情况来看最起码这个周末是安全的，这也符合当前的宏观逻辑，毕竟还没有发生任何实质性的改变，这也是一直在强调的。但下周三就会公布七月的加息计划，周四凌晨就会公布美国第二季度的GDP。\n\n然后再8月10日就会出炉7月份的CPI，所以时间还是相对比较紧。尤其是从昨天开始，美股方面已经开始炒作下周三的加息已经不仅仅是75和100的博弈，甚至已经出现了50个基点的可能，之前就和大家聊过，这次加息不论是75个基点还是100个基点，不论是否Price in（预期）都必然会对美金指数和情绪造成冲击。\n\n所以75和100都会造成利空的效应，只是多少的问题，但是加息50就完全变了，虽然也会对美金指数造成冲击，但是更大的影响在于50个基点等于是美联储变相的承认了美国经济的衰退，并且从七月开始就做好了转向的准备，而通胀是否见顶都已经不重要了，毕竟这次的问题是出在供应链上。\n\n而加息只是通过经济衰退来减少购买力，从而用降低购买力的方式来降低通胀，而经济衰退是当前的民主党所不愿意承受的，毕竟中期大选就在这里。而如果剧本真的是按照这样来走的话，经济派就会短期内大获全胜，但通胀必然会越来越高，接下来的时间自然会迎来更猛烈的反扑，但起码不是现在需要考虑的了。\n\n在这种炒作下，美股在周三公布加息数据前基本不会走的太难看，经过一个周末的炒作，周一开盘后就能看到结果了。但距离周三还是有些短，虽然短期可以提升经济派的士气，但如果没有实现加息50个基点，那么对于周内入场的投资者将会出现较大的士气打击，虽然目前来看75仍然是最大的可能。\n\nTwitter @ Phyrex_Ni\n\n截止到今天下午13点30分的BTC持仓价格分布，可以看到很大的不同，尤其是在极端价格下的情况，虽然获取数据的时间相较工作日长了5个小时，但远古持仓的BTC发生的离场数据超过了正常范围的一倍，甚至超过了近期平均值的两倍以上，而且从分布情况来看，并不像是交易所的行为，更像是用户的抛售。\n\n应该是获利用户看到BTC的价格出现了下行的趋势，担心加息和GDP发布后会造成更大的打击，甚至会担心周末发生之前崩盘的情况，所以选择提前离场，这也是目前通胀派所最担心的问题，不过就目前来看，本周末崩盘的情况几乎是不会发生了。另外就是高位套牢的BTC也出现了大量的减持。\n\n但与远古持仓的获利筹码不同，高位套牢的BTC离场主要是集中在60,000美金和62,000美金左右，尤其是62,000美金出现了高达18,600枚BTC的一次性减持，通过交叉对比来看，这两笔总量超过20,000枚BTC的减持更大的可能性还是来自于交易所的互转，并不会对价格产生冲击，而真正高位套牢筹码的减持仅200余枚。\n\n目前最大的抛压依然是围绕着当前的争端价格，尤其是BTC的价格出现了短期难以上冲的趋势，但是在ETH继续强势的情况下，BTC的走势必然会受到ETH的影响，更多的BTC也会通过汇率切换到ETH，所以获利筹码的减持继续占有更大的比重，更多的筹码也在向当前的争端价格汇聚。\n\n当前18,000美金至23,000美金之间的BTC存量已经超过了270万枚，而且该数据必然会随着BTC价格的窄幅震荡而继续增加，这是目前来看最有可能不利的局面，虽然这些筹码并不会全部都是在用户手里，但那怕只有20%至30%是被用户掌握的，那么一旦发生情绪崩溃，40,000美金和30,000美金的倾泻行为都有可能会重演。\n\n从转移到交易所的BTC日线数据可以看到，抛压进入到了下行的趋势，这一方面是说明了获利筹码在大量的减持后准备出售的剩余量已经不够多了，毕竟近期的价格是在震荡上行，20,000美金以内的筹码完全无法得到补充，必然是卖一枚少一枚，而另一方面也说明了窄幅的震荡上行和通胀的预期给了持有者信心。\n\n并不急于去将少量盈利或者亏损的筹码出售，可以在加息前再多观察一下。从细节数据上可以看到，在凌晨的美股闭盘后直至今天上午的11点之前BTC的抛压确实在增加，但在11点之后，抛压量就在持续的下降，所以我们可以知道，今天并不是没有出现小动作，只是动作太小了，以至于被足够的资金吞没了。\n\n从转出交易所的提现数据也可以看到，虽然提现离场的BTC也随着抛压而减少，但依然可以覆盖住所有的抛压，甚至还有不少的盈余，可以提走交易所之前的存量，而且从细节数据来看，虽然不是完全消耗了美股闭盘后的抛压，但也阻击了抛压的主力，使得价格开始回升，购买力也是在中午11点达到了巅峰。\n\n在交易所的BTC存量数据可以清晰的看到，截止到今天早晨八点前，交易所的库存是在持续降低的，而细节数据显示，从凌晨一点开始就出现了更多的筹码转入，虽然后续的资金在持续的消耗这部分的筹码，但仍然有部分的BTC或主动或被动的滞留在了交易所，寻找更合适的机会和价格离场。\n\n通过ETH转入转出交易所的数据可以看到，虽然ETH的购买力和价格依然是保持强势的状态，甚至又力压BTC实现领涨盘面，但筹码的抛压并没有继续下降，这代表着周末确实容易引发恐慌的联想，但目前来看这个周末不会出现大规模的抛压，所以ETH的增长幅度还是不错的，尤其周末少量资金就可以拉盘。\n\n而从ETH的交易所存量来看，虽然存量有上升的趋势，但是细节数据表明最近两天基本就是处于水平的状态，也就是说转入的抛压和购买力几乎达到了一致，但价格的上涨代表了更多的筹码并不急于离场而是等待更好的时机。另外就是Gemini产生的190万枚ETH转出已经被判断是交易所的新钱包，所以该数值会被补回。\n\n从目前资金的情况来看，欧洲的小伙伴果然还是挺不错的，随着欧洲的加息，欧元开始和美元争夺汇率，而且欧洲对应的国债利率也有部分的提升，但是因为欧洲各个国家的经济水平差距较大，偿付能力参差不齐，甚至是欧股也在加息的带动下出现下跌的情况，所以更多的资金进入美债和风险市场也是正常的。\n\n相对于USDT资金量开始上升，处于风口浪尖的美国人还是比较谨慎，但USDC的购买力虽然没有回复到年初的高水平，但是相对最近两周来说，也勉强可以及格了，尤其是USDT的做空失败后，USDT汇率已经反超。但是相对于USDT的市值完全没有增加来说，USDC最近每天都在增加数千万美金的市值，说明有资金通过USDC回归。\n\n从目前近48小时的BTC和ETH的整体抛压以及USDT和USDC的交易所转入购买力对比来看，从下午14点开始抛压虽然是在逐渐的减少，但是购买力并没有显著的上升，目前已经到了15点左右，暂时还没有发现来自于欧洲的资金，但毕竟是周末相对也是挺正常的，不过从形势上来看，ETH继续处于领导的地位。\n\n当前的BTC永续合约的情况来看，资金费率已经从全面的看多，变为了质疑阶段，看多看空在持续的变化，这不仅仅是出于对周末的担心，更多的还是随着美联储加息的临近对于后市的不看好，尤其是最近公布的数据来看，通胀见顶的言论受到的打击也越来越多，但相对来说经济问题更加严重。\n\n目前宏观上继续没有太大的变化，美金指数继续和欧元的汇率博弈，维持窄幅震荡，资金的博弈也是在经济派和通胀派之间摇摆，目前来看3%的殖利率是一个争夺点。而两年期的美债利率继续和十年期的利率发生倒挂，而且差距在逐步的扩大，目前再次超过22个基点，经济的衰退几乎是难以避免。\n\n这也是传出美联储有可能加息50个基点的原因，虽然可能性并不大，但也代表了更多的投资者认为美联储需要转向了。大众也逐渐明白，目前因为供应链导致的通胀，通过加息抑制只能是带来经济的衰退。", "timestamp": 1658563052, "digest": "2W0MNFvw53e58D7X7H515JkncklSqhlLSlkTKbOCxTc", "contributor": "0xdDa424d9bB3140bE68b0AAadCaf7CADf7c36A046"}
{"id": "RrWziyl-uupiiMQL1SIcD5df9zgONZO4QySOSpqBK9E", "title": "屏幕内外——论软件操作与日常知觉的影响(On-screen and off-screen——on the impact of software operation on life-world perceptions", "body": "## 第一章 导论\n\n### 第一节 引言\n\n如今电脑、手机等电子设备占据着生活生产大部分的时间，而软件作为电子屏幕中人际关系最重要的接口，扮演了非常重要的角色。电脑与智能手机的液晶屏幕背后，软件的世界变得越来越复杂而庞大。当今的生活生产形式在二十几年间，几乎已经被电子屏中的软件彻底颠覆了。软件这样一个虚拟世界似乎是一个平行的空间，给我们看世界的眼睛悄悄戴上了一幅眼镜。\n\n自从钻木取火开始，人类的进化就始终与工具的使用密不可分。当今世界普遍认为我们即将迎来新的技术革命，21世纪的技术被认为具备了智慧的可能性。在2018年的谷歌I/O大会上，谷歌董事长曾宣布他们的语音助手Duplex已经在商务领域通过了图灵测试。当天Duplex在大会上的演示确实为世人震惊，一时引发广泛讨论。然而没过多久就有人爆料称Duplex的语音服务有部分是人工代替。虽然事实的真像扑朔迷离，但诸如AlphaGo等智能产品的成功足以让人们担心或相信通过图灵测试的智能机器即将到来。于是诸如机器取代人类的言论铺天盖地，人们似乎并没有对技术的进一步进化做足充分的思想准备。\n\n这些恐慌都起源于人们的技术工具论思想。而软件作为当今信息技术最重要的载体，化身为各式各样的“工具”，嵌入进我们生活生产的方方面面。但是当我们使用这些软件工具的时候，却并不能引起“技术取代我们”的情绪。这其中的原因不仅仅是因为“锤子”不如“Duplex”先进，我们可能更因该思考他们之间的共性。正是基于这样的背景，我试图考察软件在使用的过程中，是如何中介着人与世界的关系。对软件操作如何影响我们感知事物的研究，或许也许可以帮助我们理解自身与技术之间的关系问题。本研究将聚焦于软件操作带来的一些认知惯性如何影响我们的在现实生活中的感知。\n\n### 第二节 研究目标与意义\n\n当今世界的电子技术与信息技术已成为生产生活最重要的基础设施，而软件作为人与电子实体的中间层，决定了我们日常生活形式的方方面面。研究人与软件交互中带来的知觉层面的影响，将可以为人与技术的关系的思考与艺术实践提供有价值的灵感与养分。\n\n本文受限于篇幅和作者的知识背景，将侧重在对功能性软件奥多比系列和社交软件抖音的交互的具体情境进行分析。并结合相关艺术案例，来探讨软件自身的交互逻辑是如何作用于人，艺术家们又该如何回应？\n\n### 第三节 人与技术的关系\n\n柏拉图早在《斐徳罗篇》中就有对书写作为一种记忆技术的思考。书写在拓展我们记忆能力的同时，是否使我们失去了记忆的能力呢？这种技术的二重性也体现在希腊神话中，爱比米修斯在给万物分发能力的时候遗漏了人类，普罗米修斯为了弥补他的过失为人类偷来了火种。然而在人类享用“火”这一技术的同时，普罗米修斯不得不替人类日夜受罚。这些古老的思想和传说显示出技术的进步始终伴随着痛楚，并且人类总是遗忘技术诞生的原始起因。 海德格尔在其演讲录《技术的追问》中专门讨论过技术的本质的问题。人们通常对技术的看法是将工具与其发展的目的的分离的，技术是人的行为，其本身是中立的。然而海德格尔认为技术演化发展的背后，隐含着一种将一切自然之物变为有待备用的“持存物”的本质。人在发明和使用技术的同时，获得了一种自由假象。而这种对技术的起源之遗忘，也导致了认为技术仅仅是达到目的的手段这样一种工具论的认识。\n\n唐·伊德在《技术与生活世界》这本书中，将人与技术的关系放在一个图形与背景/生物与环境/宏观知觉与微观知觉的框架下来审视。基于此他为人与技术的关系提出了一个四象限的框架。他认为人与技术的关系分为具身关系（embodiment relations）、诠释学关系(hermeneutic relations)、它异关系（alterity relations）和背景关系(background relations)。“具身关系”是一种非常切身的与技术的关系。例如眼镜和视觉的关系，是“我以一种特殊的使用方式将技术融入我的经验中”的情景，唐·伊德用“（人-技术）→世界”的意向图式来表示。“诠释学关系”是技术成为了我们理解世界的中介，因为技术我们才对世界获得了某种认知。比如说因为有了温度计我们才知道现在的温度是多少，意向图式为“人→（技术-世界）”。“它异关系”是技术成为了一个准它者（quasi-other）。唐·伊德用ATM机来举例，意向图式为“人-技术-（-世界）”。第四种关系是 “背景关系”。此时技术从具体的使用中隐去，成为一种背景。比如无线网络这样的技术，我们在使用它的时候感受不到它的存在，只有断网的时候才能体会到它。\n\n这些关系不是割裂的而是同时交叉存在于人与技术的关系中。唐·伊德认为人在与技术交互时，技术同时兼备一种“放大-简化”人的能力的作用，就如同望远镜延伸了我们的视觉极限，但同时也将我们的认识简化到了纯视觉的范围内。某种程度上，这也呼应了海德格尔的技术同时解蔽/遮蔽了世界的观点，并重新以生活世界的视角来解释。这种辩证的二重性并不同于通常人们所说的“技术是把双刃剑”。“双刃剑”的理论仍然是将目的与手段分裂开的想法，否认了技术与人的互相形塑的本质。唐伊德的分析是将人与技术放在一个生存论的关系中来思考的，我认为唐伊德着重生活世界的经验分析有利于在实践层面上来面对人与技术的本质这一问题，特别是在艺术实践的角度颇有启发。\n\n### 第四节 软件与界面（接口）\n\n计算机作为一种只能读取“0/1”这种电位信号的计算设备，为了提高操作效率，人类发明了各种更容易理解的符号语言来对计算机输入指令以代替去直接操作电路面板。这些符号语言发展到当今，已经变得非常“高级”或者说“用户友好”。比如更接近自然语言的“高级编程语言”以及“图形用户界面”。虽然诸如编程语言的“if…else”或者图形界面的“点击”、“拖拽”行为，看起来如此自然，容易理解，但实际上，这只不过是经由工程师将电位级别的指令规则层层抽象之后形成的一个幻象。软件就是这样一个相对于计算机底层逻辑操作的抽象的隐喻，以人类高效操作计算机为目的，并且独立于具体的硬件。\n\n如果我们将这样一座层层抽象的“巴别塔”剖开来看，每一层都可比作上一层的“软件”，编程语言之下有编译器/解释器、编译器/解释器之下有汇编语言、汇编语言之下有机器码以及指令集等等。而被工程师称为“用户（user）”的图形界面使用者，则处在这条如俄罗斯套娃一般，自相似递归链条的最末端。虽然从本质上来看，每一层都可以称作相对于上一层的软件，但作为使用者的“用户（user）”和作为书写者/定义者的“开发者（developer）”是不同的。开发者为用户开发界面/接口（interface），用户通过界面/接口使用硬件；开发者拥有比用户更多的定义权和知情权，用户更加被动地通过界面/接口的隐喻来理解计算机；开发者通过书写来与计算机沟通，用户通过对视觉符号联想来操作计算机。作为开发者的“书写”是一个大的话题，而本篇文章则侧重讨论用户与界面/接口的交互现象。虽然界面/接口不仅仅指代软件中的界面，在硬件中也存在，比如说一个耳机的插孔在英文中也被称为interface（接口）。但在中文的语境里界面通常和接口有所区分，界面更多的是虚拟的图形界面，比较相近的英文概念是图形用户界面（Graphic User Interface）。而在当今世界的生活中，图形用户界面涵盖了人们使用软件的绝大多是场景，因此本片文章的重点也是放在了对图形用户界面的分析上。\n\n## 第二章 软件操作的两个情景\n\n### 第一节 计算机辅助绘图\n\n#### **知识经验与日常经验**\n\n手掌以下两个手指的地方，也叫寸口，是长度单位。当我们想要找出正确的垂直线的时候，我们用线吊起一个重物，地心引力给手施加的压力感，以及有关万有引力的知识，让你有信心认为这根线一定是垂直指向地面的。这些“原始”的测量活动中，身体的感知必不可少。然而科学与理性的发展，让我们的脑海中多了一些超越经验范畴的知识。在墨家的《经》与欧几里得的《几何原本》中对“线”的描述有相似的地方。“端，体之无厚而最前者也”（《经》，墨子），“端，是无间”（《经说》），“点是没有的部分”（《几何原本》，欧几里得）。这些几何的概念让我们对事物的尺度具备了一种极限的认知与感悟。随着计算机辅助设计（CAD）等相关的工具软件的诞生，“点”、“线”、“面”这些原本抽象且极限的概念，在电脑中却可以以一种数学与视觉的方式显现。不仅如此，这些辅助工具还预置了让我们的设计更加完美高效的程序。比如贝塞尔曲线、B样条等算法，会根据我们实际绘制的折线，预测并描画出具有极高精度的平滑曲线。从那时开始，那些超出我们身体经验之外的精确与完美的形式，已经内化到我们的直觉中了。\n\n在人使用工具的过程中，基于科学的软件工具的发明，将那些数学几何的认知方式嵌入到了我们的身体意识当中。使得我们观察和绘图的过程中，添加了一个中间层。计算机辅助绘图软件就是这样一种中间层，下面将会以奥多比的绘图软件为例来讨论计算机辅助绘图中的人机交互关系。\n\n#### **奥多比公司的绘图工具**\n\n与计算机绘图软件起始与伊万·萨瑟兰（Ivan Sutherland）的一篇博士论文《画板》（sketchpad）（1963）。 画板（sketchpad）被认为是计算机辅助设计（CAD)的始祖。在还没有鼠标和键盘这些现代电脑标配的交互套件的时代，画板（sketchpad）这套系统就具备了非常流畅的电脑绘图交互。画板（sketchpad）可以通过“光笔”（一种光敏输入设备），可以在屏幕上绘制几何图形。并且对几个图形的各部分属性可以进行任意改动。复制、粘贴、长度修改、对齐、对称、夹角度数等等几何性质都可以精确控制，并且可以在有限的屏幕尺寸内，无线的放大和缩小图形。这项发明在当时是非常突破性的，伊万·萨瑟兰（Ivan Sutherland）博士被认为是人机交互（HCI）学科的开创人，绘图程序sketchpad的图形用户界面和面向对象的编程方法被认为是计算机图形学的重大突破。实际上，Sutherland博士凭借这篇论文成功获得了1988年的图灵奖。也正是这一年，奥多比（Adobe）公司的Illustrator桌面绘图软件正是发布了。\n\n图 1 Sketchpad， 1963\n\n《画板》（sketchpad）作为第一个图形用户界面和第一个交互式绘图程序，影响了后面的许多重要软件，奥多比的Illustrator（Adobe Illustrator）就是其中发展最好的软件之一。奥多比（Adobe）公司创始人约翰·沃诺克（John Warnock）在Evans and Sutherland公司工作的时候（Ivan Sutherland和Evans创办的著名的计算机图形公司）开始了PostScript编程语言的想法。这个技术后来成为了奥多比（Adobe）公司早期的核心技术。苹果公司的乔布斯看中奥多比（Adobe）公司的技术，并用在了苹果与佳能合作的激光打印机LaserWrite上。自从1988年Adobe Illustrator在麦金塔电脑上发布开始，电脑绘图和数字打印输出就完美的结合起来了。桌面绘图软件Illustrator，苹果麦金塔电脑和鼠标键盘，佳能的激光打印机。这一整套的工作流水线，颠覆了传统绘图和印刷出版的模式，开创了以电脑和打印机为中心的桌面出版的模式。而奥多比（Adobe）系列软件也成为了现代平面设计不可或缺的必备工作套件。从那时开始，设计绘图就从尺规手绘变成了用鼠标在屏幕上调整贝塞尔曲线。这样的模式，一直延续到现在。\n\n在前文中我们已经提到过，几何的知识，让我们具备了超越日常经验之上的认知。而这些从墨子和欧几里得发源的几何的理性知识，经由现代科学的演化，逐渐具体化成为了屏幕中的操作界面。Illustrator工具栏上琳琅满目的工具图标，虽然有着具象化的，甚至是拟物风格的图标，让你产生对生活世界中的铅笔、钢笔等工具的联想认知，但实际上他们千差万别。\n\n在Illustrator中所有的曲线绘制都是基于贝塞尔曲线算法的。当你试图用AI Illustrator）画点儿什么，即使你使用最简单的铅笔功能，Illustrator都会直接用贝塞尔的曲线对这条路径进行重新绘制。然后你可以用“直接选择”工具来调整每一个控制点。这条重绘的曲线损失了一些原作者的精确细节，但它使线条变得更完美、更符合标准的工业流程。它增强了我们对形状和线条的控制力。而复制、平移、翻转、镜像、透视变形、风格笔刷等等，更加增强了这一属性。正如Illustrator 1.0上市使用的品牌形象《维纳斯的诞生》（波提切利）一样，“让你创造完美的曲线”是Illustrator的立足之本。\n\n绘画是们古老的艺术，心、手和眼的密切配合中有着很多不可分割的相互作用过程，这决定了电脑辅助绘图将是一个高度具身化的技术。在与计算机绘图软件的发展中，数位绘画板应运而生。值得一提的是。数位板的发明实际上远早于绘图程序、乃至计算机的发明。早在1888年，伊莱莎·格雷（Elisha Gray）就发明了电传笔（如图表6），可以被认为是在电报时代用来签名的机器。现代的数位笔，如和冠(Wacom)数位笔，与其技术形式是十分相似的，他们都是将人工轨迹转换成电信号传输到电子系统来。只不过现代数位笔的无线无源技术，采用一种更自然，巧妙的技术形式。如和冠(Wacom)的数位笔使用电磁场来进行电子笔的状态探测，无需供电，就可以将笔的倾斜、压感等信息传递给电脑。使电子绘图的体验进一步逼近真实的纸笔绘图。\n\n数位板、数位笔与奥多比系列软件整合起来的数位出版工作方式，提高了出版物生产的效率，同时也促成了出版图画的新的时尚。用Illustrator绘制的图形既漂亮美观，又能高效产出，迅速风靡。电脑绘图的“自然化”实际上是唐·伊德意义上技术的具身化的加强，技术更好的化身为了人类的能力的一部分，变得更加透明化。这也使得人在使用工具的时候更不觉得工具的存在，与此同时，人的技术带来的感知能力也更加内化为人的感知。使用者可以画出更完美的曲线，更精准的造型，更完美的重复与按比例变化的细节。\n\n技术的透明度一方面让技术本身“抽身而去”，使用者在绘制的过程中忘记了工具的存在，另一方面让我们相信并依靠自己被增强的技能。绘图软件中种类繁多的微自动功能，给绘图者形象思维中植入了数学的模型。这些来自工具的逻辑不断内化到使用者的行为和想象中。\n\n谷歌人工智能实验室的日本员工在其网站上发布一个书写汉字的小实验Kanji-rnn。该实验使用了具有短期记忆的神经网络模型，通过大量将汉字的路径喂给模型，他就可以形成一个对汉字结构的模糊概念。在这个项目的线上互动展示项目上，你可以通过鼠标输入汉字的部分笔画，Kanji-rnn会实时地预测接下来的笔画，完成汉字书写。虽然这个项目并没有什么特别的研究目标，仅仅是为了实验模型的可能性。该模型只是借用表面的字形模式，并没有真正理解汉字的字形组成的内涵意义。但是类似通过路径预测的方式，如果放在警方判断犯罪行为上，则可以形成强有力的决策行为。实际上这样的方法已经发生在了现实之中。而这些更具自主性的数学模型与AI中为自动化的路径预测有着同源的亲近关系。\n\n在Illustrator的使用情景中，使用者不仅仅是通过软件来完成自己的工作，同时也在软件提供的功能框架下，逐渐形成了与软件相互镶嵌的技巧与艺术语言。软件并不是中立的，软件实际参与了绘图方法甚至设计方式的建立。在这一直觉关系中，软件不仅具有具身性，同时也有它异性。具身性增强了控制几何元素的能力，同时也将使用者的心与手的可能性简化到了数学模型的范围。而繁多且不断完善的微自动功能，也让软件具有了某种能动性， 亦即主体性。\n\nIllustrator软件是计算机辅助绘图中的一种，作为奥多比（Adobe）公司的头号产品之一，如今非常密切的参与着平面类型的创意图形的输出，包括平面设计、插画、二维动画等。作为艺术创意领域的辅助设计软件，相比如工业领域的诸如AutoCAD、犀牛等软件来说，Illustrator的软件逻辑和操作使用相对来说更加人性化，或者说有更好的“用户体验”。在界面设计领域，当说一个软件有比较好的用户体验的时候，一般是认为这个软件使用起来有比较低的学习门槛和比较直觉化的操作逻辑。“较低的学习门槛”可以被认为是软件的各部分功能和使用逻辑与用户在现实世界的经验有更多的重合。“更符合直觉的使用逻辑”是指软件的使用方法能够最大效率地是通过界面的暗示传达给用户。就使用者的感受来说，会让人感觉软件更好“上手”，觉得很好用。\n\n软件技术不仅仅是中立的工具和手段。在人与软件的交互过程中，技术依循自身的逻辑，或改造、或扩充我们的知觉，同时也选择性的简化某些认知能力。软件的自身逻辑，是其发展中的它异化的体现，逐渐发展为具有主体性的关系。在推动技术发展的过程中，我们应该密切关注技术给我们带来的影响，从而更好的让技术和我们成为合作者的而关系，而不是反噬或对立。\n\n### 第二节 抖音App的体验闭环\n\n互动体验设计是网联网产品设计的一个专业领域，其核心目标是如何使软件产品更好用。但这样的目标在一些免费的产品中，却显得有悖其初衷。从利益或者说从根本上的商业逻辑上来考虑，用户和流量就是金钱。所以免费软件的经营者和产品经理们不得不绞尽脑汁的来拉拢近的用户并促进用户活跃度，行话称其为“拉新”和“促活”。在这样的大背景下，被称为用户的软件使用者们，行为上瘾在所难免。免费的软件实际上并不免费。\n\n免费经济带来的软件沉迷是值得反思和探讨的，在这一章中我讲探讨抖音app为例，来探讨社交类软件是如何构建起不断吸引用户使用的体验闭环的。\n\n#### **那些欲罢不能的功能**\n\n在社交类的软件的互动设计中，有许多让人“上瘾”的功能，比如facebook发明的点赞，youtube的自动播放下一条视频，app来新消息时的小红点，粉丝量，等等。者每一项发明的背后几乎有着心理学的原理，利用人们的心理弱点，来让用户不假思索地产生行动。著名学者普林斯顿心理学博士亚当 · 阿尔特（Adam Alter）曾提出了“行为上瘾”的概念，并列举了行为上瘾的六项相关构成要素，分别是：\n\n1. 诱人的目标\n2. 无法抵挡且无法预知的积极反馈\n3. 渐进改善的感觉\n4. 越来越困难的任务\n5. 需要解决却暂未解决的紧张感\n6. 强大的社会联系\n   抖音则全部满足了以上要求。如自动推荐的内容，让用户始终无法预知下一个视频的内容，始终保持好奇、滑动屏幕的时候自动播放、15秒配有动感音乐的短视频与自动播放、和点赞社交的激励。其中功能大多都有相应的神经学或者脑科学的理论的成果支持。如间歇性变量奖励（自动推荐）、先于理智的音乐与视觉刺激（自动播放）、蔡格尼克记忆效应（Zeigarnik effect）（15秒视频的意犹未尽）等等。基于抖音软件的音乐短视频的内容和其产品理念“记录美好生活”，抖音在基于以上设计之中主要强化的了沉浸式瀑布流的交互形式，接下来我将主要分析抖音主界面的瀑布流交互。", "timestamp": 1658562926, "digest": "XcChq2AFKErcKSkJCfUL9-_tZUWtjGdWUfwGPOqoqP4",

{"id": "Bap_BXoeK7_HqorDbDk6y6qkHVNxrXMznl2z5KGoj5M", "title": "CIAN - Defi 自動化平台", "body": "## 項目簡介\n\nCIAN 是一個一站式的 Defi 自動化操作平台，串連了多個 Defi 協議並定義出許多不同的模組化任務，讓你可以自由地組合出需要的投資策略。CIAN 幫忙減少了許多鏈上繁瑣的操作，節省人力與時間成本的同時，還可以提升你的資本利用率與投資效率。使用此平台你不需要像使用其他收益聚合器一樣，將資產放在 Defi 協議金庫中已進行投資策略，反之你的資產都會放在一個由你擁有的智能合約錢包中，不用將資產託管給任何人，只需要進行有限的授權即可使用投資策略。\n\n只看上面描述可能稍難想像 CIAN 實質上可以做什麼，以下舉個例：\n\n> 當我們在鏈上流動性挖礦尤其是開槓桿在挖時，最害怕的就是幣價劇烈漲跌導致清算，沒賺到利息還賠了本金。而 CIAN 可以做到 當 Collateral Ratio 過度上升時自動幫你減倉避免清算，同時還能做到當 Collateral Ratio 下降時自動幫你加倉讓你資金利用率更高APY更高。（ p.s. 在 CIAN 平台中 Collateral Ratio 的定義是：債務價值/抵押品價值 x 100%，越高越容易被清算。）\n\n項目方目前正在舉行[測試活動](https://cian-app.medium.com/automated-protection-week-bc9e3eea7bb8)，完成任務可獲得 NFT ，日後會依據 NFT 進行代幣空投。個人非常建議大家去做測試任務，可以對平台使用的邏輯有更全面的了解（還可以嚕點空投）。\n\n（風險提示：此產品還在初期階段，目前合約陸續審計中\\[[審計報告](https://docs.cian.app/security-and-risk/audit-report)\\]，使用時請注意風險控管。此文內容與心得皆來自於官方資料及小弟跟官方人員的問答，皆為個人見解莫忘DYOR）\n\n## CIAN 官方資料\n\n網站：<https://cian.app/>\n推特：<https://twitter.com/CIAN_protocol>\nDC：[discord.gg/cian](https://t.co/1MgtsDZEta)\nYoutube：<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNXPpWUHKL0SJG9npO_QCug>\nDocs：<https://docs.cian.app/>\nMedium：[cian-app.medium.com](https://t.co/Sm6acl91zS)\n\n## 功能簡介\n\nCIAN 使用非託管的智能合約錢包來實現自動化幫使用者執行 Defi 策略任務的功能。除了一站式好管理以外，還有精簡操作步驟、自動化加倉、自動化保護倉位、一鍵閃電貸倉位上槓桿等功能，可以說是 Defi Degen 的利器。CIAN 是有多鏈野心的，不過目前初期公鏈先只支援Avalanche，Protocol 方面目前支援 借貸協議包括：AAVE、Benqi、Trader Joe，流動性協議包括：Axial、Curve、Pangolin、Trader Joe、Vector。相信日後會越支援更多協議提供更多組合性。\n\n接下來會一一簡介功能的用途，使用方式及步驟 官方Youtube 有非常詳細的 Step by Step 教學我會附上。\n\n### Smart Contract Wallet - 智能合約錢包\n\n在我們開始使用 CIAN 的服務前我們會需要先創建一個智能合約錢包，這是因為 CIAN 主打自動化，這意味著我們只需設定好任務，之後人可以離開、去睡覺、去玩 不用一直提心吊膽的看著，我們的鏈上投資會照著設定的規則自動運行。在無託管、確保資產安全性的前提下，CIAN要做到這件事的解法就是替我們創建一個由使用者自己擁有的智能合約，再由使用者透過 [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) 授權 CIAN 替我們的倉位進行各種設定好的操作，CIAN 取得授權後只能操作你存入智能合約錢包中的資產與瓦斯費，不會能控制你本身錢包內的任何資產，這點是很不錯的設計。\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/9Gg74nn1WsI](https://youtu.be/9Gg74nn1WsI)\n\n### Position Building - 倉位創建\n\n* **Borrow to Farm**\n\n這是我們經常會使用到的 Farming 策略，CIAN 將其整合起來讓你可以一頁式操作多個需要用到的協議。\n\n此功能讓你可以簡單快速做到以下步驟： 存資產到借貸平台 -> 借出其他資產 -> 將資產換成 50/50 的兩種資產 -> 組成 LP -> Farming LP。\n\n經統計以上步驟若無 CIAN 幫你整合，你至少得跳轉頁面 7 次經過 3 個不同的 Protocol 點擊 46 下才能完成，而在 CIAN 你可以在 1 個頁面裡 10 次點擊內完成，雖然我不是數學家但這聽起來很不錯對吧！\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/Q68-uDr_1OI](https://youtu.be/Q68-uDr_1OI)\n\n### Automation Scenarios - 自動化場景\n\n當設定的條件滿足了，會自動執行相應任務。\n\n* **Auto Borrow 自動借款**\n\n在借貸協議中當你的抵押品(ex:ETH)價格上漲時，可以借出來使用的資產也會變多，但若要時常關注並手動調整光用想的就覺得很麻煩，Auto Borrow 解決的就是這件事。我們可以提前設定，當抵押品上漲 Collateral Ratio 降到一定比率時，自動幫忙借款加倉我們的倉位，將 Collateral Ratio 調整到設定的比率，提高資產利用率。\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/eES9RfIC0ZE](https://youtu.be/eES9RfIC0ZE)\n\n* **Auto Repay 自動還款**\n\n相對於 Auto Borrow，當抵押品價格下跌，會造成我們的 collateral ratio 升高，增加清算風險。所以有這個功能，讓我們可以提前設定，當抵押品下跌 Collateral Ratio 升到一定比率，自動幫忙降低倉位並向借貸協議還款，將 Collateral Ratio 調整到設定的比率，降低清算風險。\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/og7b9aEMLcU](https://youtu.be/og7b9aEMLcU)\n\n* **Flash Repay 閃電還款**\n\n在市場經歷極端行情時，可能會造成 Auto Repay 無法即時調倉成功，需要非常手段來進行 Reapy 避免清算，這就是 Flash Reapy 的功能。Flash Repay 作用的原理是 直接使用 AAVE 的 [Flash Loan 閃電貸](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/flash-loans) 功能在無需抵押品的情況下借錢去 Repay 你的債務 降低 Collateral Ratio 避免清算，解除危機後再變賣你的抵押品來還閃電貸的錢，全部在一個區塊裡完成。是非常直接快速的 Repay 方式，需要注意的是使用閃電貸會產生 0.09% 的手續費，不過總比被清算好，這還是一個很有效的極端行情保險措施！\n\n官方教學影片：\n\n[https://youtu.be/pmOxKXnzIPg](https://youtu.be/pmOxKXnzIPg)\n\n### Automated Strategies - 自動化策略\n\nCIAN 提供了一些很不錯的自動化策略供我們使用，若你有不錯的策略想提供給 CIAN做使用，也可以加入官方DC群到 [#strategy-lab](https://discord.com/channels/948448386963623986/994994081925181560) 提供！下面我來介紹其中一個策略“槓桿質押”賺年化。\n\n* **Leveraged Stacking - AAVE**\n\n這個策略賺了 2 種年化，其一是在 BENQI 質押 Avax 獲得的質押年化，其二是將質押 Avax 拿到的 sAvax 提供到 AAVE 獲得的借貸年化。此策略還會使用閃電貸將我們的資產加上 7 倍槓桿已獲得數倍的年化（撰文當下約60\\~70%年化）。\n\n策略步驟解釋如下（以下所有步驟在1個transaction內完成）：\n\n假設我們有 100 Avax 且 Avax/sAvax 兌換率約為1。\n假設 Max LTV(可以想像成 可以借的價值/需要抵押的價值) = 0.95\\*0.97\\*清算門檻 = 87.54%\n\n1. 質押 100 Avax 到 BENQI(BLS) 並收到 100 sAvax 與質押收益。\n2. 將100 sAvax 存進 AAVE V3 已獲得借貸收益。（E-mode 打開）\n3. 從 Trader Joe 閃電貸貸出 702.56 Avax（加上7.02 倍槓桿）\n4. 將閃電貸到的 702.56 Avax 質押到 BLS 已獲得 702.56 sAvax與額外的質押收益。\n5. 將從上一步拿到的 702.56 Avax 存進 AAVE V3 賺額外的借貸收益。\n6. 使用存入的 802.56 sAvax 當抵押品借出 703.2 Avax 還清閃電貸\n\n此策略的年化計算公式為：\n\n![年化計算公式](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*EWX43_O5isG-snMtwyl2pg.png)\n\n詳細解釋請見 [官方教學文件](https://cian-app.medium.com/leveraged-staking-strategies-for-savax-32662f044298)。非常建議大家使用較為 Degen 的策略前一定要去看看官方解釋文檔，有很多參數像是借貸利率、質押利率、手續費變動都是影響收益的因子，請至少一定要有所了解再行投資。\n\n### 結尾\n\n至此已經將目前 CIAN 有的功能與大家介紹了一遍。我個人認為 CIAN 在做的這件事是有相當需求的，讓人們在不需親自 Coding 的前提下更方便的執行 Defi 策略（畢竟不是任何人都是科學家），除了讓 Defi 樂高的組合更方便，也大大提升投資時的倉位安全與資本效率，總的來說是很不錯的服務方向。項目方目前是打算發幣的也已有測試活動進行中讓大家有機會獲得空投，不過目前代幣捕獲價值的方式還不明確 Tokenomics 還沒公佈，大家若要投資項目代幣還是得先確認營利方式及代幣經濟模型是否足夠健全。\n\n感謝各位觀看，若有任何問題或是想要交流歡迎使用推特與我聯繫。\n\n[https://twitter.com/royhuan38041974](https://twitter.com/royhuan38041974)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658563264, "digest": "F8CAnIM7Gx1QpqJFR9Jaw1Z0NrOf3q_B78yNu1K9W0Y", "contributor": "0xa49aBc88a521dc131a3B859dd40d2B7028Bc78F2"}

{"id": "icGb9wFY1otC27AzVOSD_seoWKrKYztKAnVzcaMAlFc", "title": "7 O’Clock Capital：一文尽览DAO的昨天，今天，明天", "body": "## 引言\n\n根据DeepDAO的数据显示，目前Web3空间已经有4834个DAO组织，管理资产总额超过80亿美金。\n\nDAO最初曾叫做DAC（Decentralized Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n###  一、DAO的定义与优势 \n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表 \n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题 \n\n### 四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658563922, "digest": "KvNt31YsNglF7d1tgkwc11UD6_WpqcxxgBdYYIG-LXc", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

{"id": "mWvGDbam-JzSD1fFtNLP7nS11Vy0PsfwPI1vUWGjOOw", "title": "Freemint全流程工具大全，带你在免费NFT项目里每天赚0.1E\n", "body": "如果说NFT世界里现在最热的机会是什么，几乎所有活跃的NFT玩家都会告诉你，是Freemint NFT项目。几乎所有的Alpha 社区都在讨论各种Freemint项目，并从中找到获利的机会。\n\n所谓Freemint项目就是Mint时项目方不再收取任何费用，你仅需花Gas费，在现在以太日常Gas费极低的状态时，约等于不要钱参与各个NFT项目。\n\n其中有些Freemint NFT 项目是可以参与的，轻松获得几十倍回报（因为gas费可能只花了1-2U，如果能在OpenSea上卖出0.01X ETH的价格，那就是几十倍的利润回报）。\n\n本文将对如下问题，结合最趁手的工具工具，一步步来教你如何参与Freemint项目，并有机会每个钱包每天获取0.1E以上的合理利润：\n\n1、Freemint的项目如何第一时间知道；\n\n2、如何避免有坑的Freemint项目（项目方在授权中有各种后门，或者是批量制造Freemint项目，没有买盘白花了Gas费）；\n\n3、如何第一时间上架并设置最合理的卖价让利润奔跑；\n\n4、如何在二级市场里买到性价比最高的Freemint项目转手再卖获得二次利润\n\n### 一、如何使用Freemint工具安全快速的参加Freemint NFT项目\n\n这个市场上如何第一时间得知Freemint项目呢？因为Freemint项目知道稍晚，就参与不了了，一般用户是通过moby或者icy.tools两个平台来发现Freemint项目，但是这两个公众皆知的平台往往会滞后5-30分钟的时间。\n\n在这里我推荐更快速的方法能帮助你抢的头筹。\n\n在上一篇文章：NFT赋能方式评价指南里，提到了一个PASS卡的项目Metabus。\n\n在Opensea找到Metabus项目，买到他们的Pass卡，然后到官网：metabus.tech里质押12个月，然后到Metabus 的discord 里验证一下自己的钱包，然后在Support里open ticket，提出申请，就能进入First Class群组。\n\n当你获得了First Class角色后，就可以开通如下功能：\n\n其中Free-mint功能就能获得当前市场最新的Freemint项目的必须资讯，可以比moby和icy.tools快5-30分钟，这样你就有充分的时间可以分析这个项目的网站、Twiiter和Discord的用户数和交互活跃度。\n\n因为如果一个Freemint项目没有网站，没有Twitter（Opensea上没有项目方的网站和twitter链接），那么基本就可以认为是一个临时拼凑的资金盘项目了，甚至可能有坑。\n\n如果项目方网站制作精美，Twitter用户数和交互活跃，那可以考虑参与，而且日后可能会有很大的上升空间。\n\n这里举一个百倍的Freemint项目的例子，早看到查询项目方Twitter后，可以判断这是一个绝对可以抢的Freemint的项目。\n\n至于如何能卖到这么高的价格，就要看下面的文章了。\n\n上面我们得知了Freemint项目，但是只有交易hash，并不知道mint的地址，下面这个工具则是帮你快速mint的工具，而不需要找到网站。\n\n冲土狗：也是Metabus开发的，安全性无需怀疑\n\n[冲土狗](https://tools.metabus.tech/#)\n\n[冲土狗](https://tools.metabus.tech/#)\n\n[tools.metabus.tech](https://tools.metabus.tech/#)\n\n第一步：打开网页，点击：确认PRC节点\n\n第二步：从刚才的metabus的discord 的Free-mint频道里看中的Freemint项目，点击监听交易，找到交易的Hash，填入到上图中：复制别人的交易Hash；\n\n第三步：工具自动帮你算出小费、MaxFee、Gas limit、总价、合约地址、十六进制数据，如果是Freemint项目，这些数据可以不用更改。\n\n第四步：在小狐狸钱包插件里找到专门冲土狗的钱包的私钥（冲Freemint项目一定要用新的钱包，里面最多放0.3E，用于Gas和在Opensea上架，定期将盈利转出），填入选择本地私钥的对话框，然后点击验证，然后执行Mint\n\n第五步：点击页面左上角：重置页面数据。\n\n上述步骤就完成参与一个Freemint项目的过程，但是仅仅会买是不够的，如何快速且用当前最合适的价格卖出成本，并且判断是否有持续上涨的机会争取最大获益才是关键，下面的文档就是教你如何组合使用工具帮你利润奔跑。\n\n### 二、如何快速查询Freemint项目中你的NFT稀有度排名？\n\n### ERCSniper\n\n下载安装包，到项目方Discord里找到频道#updates下载最新版至本地，解压后得到dist目录\n\n[Join the ERC Rarity Discord Server!](https://discord.com/invite/ercsniper)\n\n[High-end, advanced NFT data and automation tools | 50,870 members](https://discord.com/invite/ercsniper)\n\n[discord.com](https://discord.com/invite/ercsniper)\n\n进入谷歌浏览器打开扩展程序，浏览器输入：chrome://extensions/，打开开发者模式，点击：加载已解压的扩展程序，选择刚刚erc的解压包，并确认后可成功安装（Windows和Mac都可以安装）\n\n点击ERCSnifer右侧的📌logo，激活ERCSnifer扩展\n\n点击安装成功后的插件显示填写小狐狸id，如下图：\n\n从小狐狸的扩展里找到Metamask ID，然后复制粘贴到这里：\n\n打开Opensea任意一个在售的NFT项目页面之后，点Login，成功后就可以看到弹出的插件显示Connected\n\n同时OS页面也能显示Quick Buy和View on ERCRarity两个新功能模块\n\n在这里输入Gas，输入买入合约的地址，就能用Quick Buy一键买入无需任何确认的过程。\n\n点击View on ERCRarity，可以看到这个项目所有的排名以及上架情况，就可以轻松选择性价比最高的买入。\n\nERCSnifer相比其他查询属性排名的工具，优势在于对新的图狗项目的排名计算特别快，适合冲图狗追求时间和效率的用户使用。\n\n### NFTeye\n\n如果觉得上一个插件安装比较麻烦，也可以使用这个插件\n\n[NFTEye](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nfteye/imbkphhpfhkebpifdomcihkcjelnpamo/related?hl=zh-CN)\n\n[Boost your OpenSea experience with rarity ranks and analytics insights.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nfteye/imbkphhpfhkebpifdomcihkcjelnpamo/related?hl=zh-CN)\n\n[chrome.google.com](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nfteye/imbkphhpfhkebpifdomcihkcjelnpamo/related?hl=zh-CN)\n\n同时配合网站使用，下面我会着重说明一些网站数据如何使用。\n\n[Dashboard Collections/NFTs | NFTEye](https://nfteye.io/dashboard)\n\n[30 Day Volume](https://nfteye.io/dashboard)\n\n[nfteye.io](https://nfteye.io/dashboard)\n\n**数据看板Dashboard**\n\n1、当前（15分钟）热门mint项目和热门交易项目（Hot Mints and Hot Sale Collections）\n\n在这里看到的热门且Mint Price为Free的项目，在Gas不高的情况下，可以利用前文提到的冲土狗工具适当冲几个。或者点击Link，直达项目的页面去手工mint，不过一般好的Freemint的项目，很难抢过使用工具的用户。\n\n2、24小时内前50名交易热度的项目（Top 50 Collections(24H）\n\n**发现Discovery**\n\n可以看到当前交易热度高的项目的发行时间，发行价格等数据\n\n**项目 Collection**\n\n这个功能是重点来查询大家挂单价格的分布情况，同时右上角有个值得大家关注的数据：\n\nOn Sale\n\n这里显示了上架数量/总数量的比例关系，大于10%的项目要尽快出逃，说明这个项目大家觉得尽快卖出有利可图。\n\n如果小于5%，且24小时内交易比较活跃，则可以根据ERSSniper查询排名较高且定价较低的项目买入。\n\n然后结合下图中Listing Ratio，看上架比例的变化趋势，如果是上架比例一直在升高，也要提高警惕，如果Listing Ratio一直在降低，同时Floor Price能保持或有提升，说明这个项目纸手逐渐被吸走，如果有合适的价格可以考虑入手。\n\n另外可以参考的数据就是看项目里大佬的持有数量\n\n两种情况可以作为低价买入的标准：\n\n1、大佬在低价时持续扫货，那就在大佬扫货的更低价时寻找合适标的入手；\n\n2、用户人数/项目 NFT总数如果大于50%（NFT已经均匀分散到各个用户手中）且Listing Ratio一直比较低，说明大家都非常看好这个项目不愿意出售，那么出现低价时也知道入手。\n\n**My Portfolio 我的项目**\n\n这个功能强烈推荐，可以看到这个钱包总花费成本和当前各个项目地板价格可以获得的收益，帮助你更好掌握自己的收益情况！\n\nNFTeye插件里超实用二级市场抄底功能（其他插件目前还没有）：\n\n上面有两组数字：597/5000，这是指这个NFT在总共5000个NFT经过计算属性排名第597，这个功能大家都有，但是第二组数字就要特别关注了：35/541，这是指在当前上架的541个NFT里，它的性价比指数排名第35，属于值得去抢的。\n\n最后一个功能特色，需要加入他们的Discord\n\n[Discord - A New Way to Chat with Friends & Communities](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n[Discord is the easiest way to communicate over voice, video, and text. Chat, hang out, and stay close with your friends and communities.](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n[discord.gg](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n可以查询到：巨鲸扫货，这样自己Freemint的项目如果被扫货，那么后面上架的价格就可以提高\n\n此外NFTeye对于Metabus的Pass 卡会员还提供了特别支持：\n\n只需关注官方推特[@nfteye_io](https://twitter.com/nfteye_io)，转推置顶推特并安装插件，便可在discord内获得OG身份。\n\n有了OG身份，Discord的各项功能都可以使用啦！\n\n### 三、如何计算合理的上架价格？\n\n### NFT Profit Calculator\n\n适合计算Freemint项目的上架价格和收益的工具\n\n[Opensea NFT Profit Calculator | Free, Easy to Use](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n[Calculate the anticipated profit of your NFT Purchase, including break-even price.](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n[opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n点击上面的链接，进入NFT Profit Calculator，NFT上架利润计算器\n\n其中将你将上文中提到的ERCSniper找到的排名最低的免费NFT上架到Opensea，上架价格设定到当前的地板价。\n\nOpensea collection URL or Name：\n\n这里填入刚刚你上架的NFT的Opensea URL（网址），然后点击Get Data。\n\n第三行Royalties（Opensea+Creator）就会自动显示，这里是Opensea的销售抽成+创作者的版税抽成。\n\nBuy Price填入你mint时给项目方的费用，Freemint的项目一般这里是0，其他的项目根据你参与的价格填写。\n\nGas Fee根据你mint时大概的成本填入\n\nListing Fee是你第一次在Opensea上卖这个项目需要Opensea批准所花的gas费，仅本系列第一个NFT项目售卖时才会有的成本。\n\nListing Price就是你上架的价格。\n\n上述输入完毕后，关注下面的数据\n\nBREAKEVEN 是指你的盈亏平衡价，高于这个价格都会是赚钱的\n\nTRUE PROFIT 是你本笔交易会盈利的价格。\n\n⚠️：严格管制ERCSniper 给的Rank，如果本系列Freemint NFT的交易量很大（每分钟交易数量超过5笔，或者在NFTeye Dashboard的Hot collections的排名里）排在前5%、10%，前30%的一定要给一个比地板价更高的价格，别轻易就贱卖了。\n\n### Derisk收益计算器\n\n这个计算器适合用在Mint非免费的项目上计算收益\n\n[Derisk](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n[Enter a transaction hash/id above to view the transaction details and derisk amount.](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n[www.derisk.tools](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n来自Metabus的骄子的分享\n\n这个计算收益的工具会更简便， 输入mint或者交易时的hash，填入你想卖的价格，自动计算收益了。\n\n这个计算工具推荐使用在正常的NFT项目上，对于Freemint项目，因为缺乏Mint和List的Gas成本统计，所以还有偏差。因为Freemint项目里Gas成本占比很高。\n\n### 四、上架和批量购买的工具Gem.xyz\n\n最近当出现一些比较火热的Freemint项目时，Opensea的相关页面经常出现拥堵。比如Netfilx的NFT项目，就出现页面30分钟没有打开，到时Floor Price从1一直降到了0.04ETH。如果能及时上架，可能就获得了最好的销售价格。\n\n这里推荐一个批量上架和批量购买的工具：Gem\n\n[Gem - The NFT Marketplace Aggregator](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[Discover and collect NFTs across all marketplaces](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[www.gem.xyz](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n当Mint完NFT希望能快速批量上架时，选中你要上架的NFT，然后点击右侧：Proceed to LIst。\n\n进入到下一个页面后，可以在NFT Marketplaces上选择要上架的平台：Opensea、Looksrare和X2Y2可以一键上架。\n\n同一个NFT在Opensea设置好价格，这个NFT在Looksrare和X2Y2的价格也设置好了，不同的NFT可以阶梯设置价格。\n\n都设置好后，点击右侧：Set Your Price。可以一键帮你在各个平台完成这个项目NFT授权并签名上架。使得你上架的速度远超过其他人，可以在最好的价格时卖出，同时还节约了Gas费。\n\n另外一个值得使用的功能就是批量购买（主要是扫地板）。\n\n当我们在NFTeye里看到有价值的NFT项目，这里拿Free mint的项目：Mender NFT举例，这个项目是免费mint的，但是只要价格低于0.012ETH（相对于免费mint用户的4倍收益），就会有批量扫地板的用户。\n\n所以我也通过Gem，选择Mender NFT，然后在地板价里选择我要购买的NFT，然后点击：Buy Now\n\n使用批量购买工具的好处，一是比别人更快抢到低价，二是Gas比分开在Opensea上买要节省。\n\n所以如果大家喜欢做Freemint项目二级市场的高抛低吸，Gem是一件必不可少的工具。\n\n如果你希望持续看到原创的高质量文章，请关注Twitter：[@TheOneGuo](https://twitter.com/TheOneGuo)\n\n关注我的Mirror：下载Inoreader APP，输入：<https://submirror.xyz/autometafi.eth/> 可以完成对我的Mirror的订阅，当新的原创文章写完后，可以随时在APP上获得提醒并阅读\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658563867, "digest": "Q_aZ37Ada0_ZfOa7GhMIK3uG3XMd9H96mpM3D4YUuZQ", "contributor": "0x25b8584F65E4ee2FDa74c90E4a3A1755efA92580"}

Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n###  一、DAO的定义与优势 二、DAO的分类与代表 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题 四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658563875, "digest": "KZjXp2uEShfYRLc4TpJgz_bZ4uZkKpUrbEMJgHitSew", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

Chat, hang out, and stay close with your friends and communities.](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n[discord.gg](https://discord.gg/pj2VuZsK)\n\n可以查询到：巨鲸扫货，这样自己Freemint的项目如果被扫货，那么后面上架的价格就可以提高\n\n此外NFTeye对于Metabus的Pass 卡会员还提供了特别支持：\n\n只需关注官方推特[@nfteye_io](https://twitter.com/nfteye_io)，转推置顶推特并安装插件，便可在discord内获得OG身份。\n\n有了OG身份，Discord的各项功能都可以使用啦！\n\n### 三、如何计算合理的上架价格？\n\n### NFT Profit Calculator\n\n适合计算Freemint项目的上架价格和收益的工具\n\n[Opensea NFT Profit Calculator | Free, Easy to Use](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n[Calculate the anticipated profit of your NFT Purchase, including break-even price.](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n[opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io](https://opensea-nft-profit-calculator.webflow.io/)\n\n点击上面的链接，进入NFT Profit Calculator，NFT上架利润计算器\n\n其中将你将上文中提到的ERCSniper找到的排名最低的免费NFT上架到Opensea，上架价格设定到当前的地板价。\n\nOpensea collection URL or Name：\n\n这里填入刚刚你上架的NFT的Opensea URL（网址），然后点击Get Data。\n\n第三行Royalties（Opensea+Creator）就会自动显示，这里是Opensea的销售抽成+创作者的版税抽成。\n\nBuy Price填入你mint时给项目方的费用，Freemint的项目一般这里是0，其他的项目根据你参与的价格填写。\n\nGas Fee根据你mint时大概的成本填入\n\nListing Fee是你第一次在Opensea上卖这个项目需要Opensea批准所花的gas费，仅本系列第一个NFT项目售卖时才会有的成本。\n\nListing Price就是你上架的价格。\n\n上述输入完毕后，关注下面的数据\n\nBREAKEVEN 是指你的盈亏平衡价，高于这个价格都会是赚钱的\n\nTRUE PROFIT 是你本笔交易会盈利的价格。\n\n⚠️：严格管制ERCSniper 给的Rank，如果本系列Freemint NFT的交易量很大（每分钟交易数量超过5笔，或者在NFTeye Dashboard的Hot collections的排名里）排在前5%、10%，前30%的一定要给一个比地板价更高的价格，别轻易就贱卖了。\n\n### Derisk收益计算器\n\n这个计算器适合用在Mint非免费的项目上计算收益\n\n[Derisk](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n[Enter a transaction hash/id above to view the transaction details and derisk amount.](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n[www.derisk.tools](https://www.derisk.tools/)\n\n来自Metabus的骄子的分享\n\n这个计算收益的工具会更简便， 输入mint或者交易时的hash，填入你想卖的价格，自动计算收益了。\n\n这个计算工具推荐使用在正常的NFT项目上，对于Freemint项目，因为缺乏Mint和List的Gas成本统计，所以还有偏差。因为Freemint项目里Gas成本占比很高。\n\n### 四、上架和批量购买的工具Gem.xyz\n\n最近当出现一些比较火热的Freemint项目时，Opensea的相关页面经常出现拥堵。比如Netfilx的NFT项目，就出现页面30分钟没有打开，到时Floor Price从1一直降到了0.04ETH。如果能及时上架，可能就获得了最好的销售价格。\n\n这里推荐一个批量上架和批量购买的工具：Gem\n\n[Gem - The NFT Marketplace Aggregator](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[Discover and collect NFTs across all marketplaces](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[www.gem.xyz](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n当Mint完NFT希望能快速批量上架时，选中你要上架的NFT，然后点击右侧：Proceed to LIst。\n\n进入到下一个页面后，可以在NFT Marketplaces上选择要上架的平台：Opensea、Looksrare和X2Y2可以一键上架。\n\n同一个NFT在Opensea设置好价格，这个NFT在Looksrare和X2Y2的价格也设置好了，不同的NFT可以阶梯设置价格。\n\n都设置好后，点击右侧：Set Your Price。可以一键帮你在各个平台完成这个项目NFT授权并签名上架。使得你上架的速度远超过其他人，可以在最好的价格时卖出，同时还节约了Gas费。\n\n另外一个值得使用的功能就是批量购买（主要是扫地板）。\n\n当我们在NFTeye里看到有价值的NFT项目，这里拿Free mint的项目：Mender NFT举例，这个项目是免费mint的，但是只要价格低于0.012ETH（相对于免费mint用户的4倍收益），就会有批量扫地板的用户。\n\n所以我也通过Gem，选择Mender NFT，然后在地板价里选择我要购买的NFT，然后点击：Buy Now\n\n使用批量购买工具的好处，一是比别人更快抢到低价，二是Gas比分开在Opensea上买要节省。\n\n所以如果大家喜欢做Freemint项目二级市场的高抛低吸，Gem是一件必不可少的工具。\n\n如果你希望持续看到原创的高质量文章，请关注Twitter：[@TheOneGuo](https://twitter.com/TheOneGuo)\n\n关注我的Mirror：下载Inoreader APP，输入：<https://submirror.xyz/autometafi.eth/> 可以完成对我的Mirror的订阅，当新的原创文章写完后，可以随时在APP上获得提醒并阅读\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658563866, "digest": "JEEWTgiCshgP_oeU6ysS79HfATOdQMGp22m6jNG0q4U", "contributor": "0xC46b27C093D2f8eD4A74f2E8dB62663B597b374b"}
{"id": "FD5Oz1S27WsVIt44ihda-9d2uGh3GTIQ-FlF8fDR12k", "title": "7 O’Clock Capital：一文尽览DAO的昨天，今天，明天", "body": "## 引言\n\n根据DeepDAO的数据显示，目前Web3空间已经有4834个DAO组织，管理资产总额超过80亿美金。\n\nDAO最初曾叫做DAC（Decentralized Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n二、DAO的分类与代表\n三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658564035, "digest": "Dhx8U-zD1csc5EWPhDR-uNNfMQBUnHZ_uexhKRdI98c", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n一、DAO的定义与优势\n二、DAO的分类与代表\n三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658564074, "digest": "AwrvrNGsQ9zo7Yrz2vH-EzAfnYmCNGSlGf0yvl8l9N8", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

Autonomous Corporation），如今我们所熟知的DAO概念由V神在2014年的《DAO、DAC、DA 等：不完整的术语指南》文章中被确定席位。\n\n而最早的DAO名为The DAO，成立于2016年的5月，曾创下了当时最大的众筹活动记录：价值1.5亿的ETH。它是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化风险投资基金，作为“将资金分散到项目的枢纽”，DAO 通过其Token授予成员投票权，成员通过投票将这些资金分散到不同“承包商”提出的项目中， 而“策展人”则负责在项目被列入白名单之前做背调。\n\nDAO从产生至现在不到10年，却俨然已经成为了加密世界的时尚宠儿。我们无法否认这其中有很多人带着FOMO情绪随波逐流，但是DAO能成为加密行业的一支重要赛道，是因为它利用区块链技术革新了人类史上一些传统规则，关于利益与权力。\n\n究其原因，内部来说，是因为DAO所塑造的是去除感情主观判断的，公平的利益分配，以及无权力中心，成员皆可行使权力的平等环境，满足了人类不再受制于阶层与上下级的内心需求。外部来说，新冠疫情是意料之外的助推器。疫情影响下的分布式办公愈发普遍，线上协作成为团队处理工作的日常，为DAO的去中心化治理添了一把旺火。\n\n## 目录：\n\n\n\n一、DAO的定义与优势\n\n二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n### 一、DAO的定义与优势\n\nDAO的全称是Decentralized Autonomous Organization, 即去中心化自治组织，是基于区块链的，由具有共识的群体所自发产生的组织。\n\n传统组织的结构是自上而下的层层分级，目标和任务层层下发，成员完成任务获得报酬，属于金字塔模式。而DAO则是一群人因拥有相同的共识聚集在一起，通过提案、投票、悬赏等方式参与治理，以Token奖励实现激励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aQD2DSQVFYwBcOiIa09gF.png?height=486&width=779)\n\nDAO的关键词在于：去中心化、自治、组织。\n\n* 去中心化 DAO的基础是区块链，治理去中心化，无层级化的高管和集权。\n* 自治 理想中的DAO管理是代码化的，基于设定好的智能合约，达到一定条件就可以触发程序，自动完成治理。\n* 组织 共识驱动，任何人都可以加入任何DAO组织。\n\n与传统组织的区别在于： 传统组织是自上而下，从权力中心对各个角色做出安排并进行利益划分，包含各种感性因素。DAO是扁平化，由角色共同完成某个决定，并依据链上数据与算法，客观的进行利益分配或激励。\n\n详细区别请参考以下中金公司研究部图表：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vebE-JObL3Nlrs-JPK8IP.png?height=827&width=1429)\n\nDAO的优势由其特性而来：\n\n* 更强的组织共识 去中心化组织不同于传统组织的听从安排，是因为有共识才得以形成，因此成员忠诚度与贡献意愿更高；\n* 更透明 DAO基于区块链技术与智能合约，链上数据皆可循，所有行为更加透明与公平；\n* 更自由 线上协作突破地理限制，同时加入与退出也都更为自由。\n\n### 二、DAO的分类与代表\n\n7 O'Clock Capital 根据对目前加密市场DAO项目的梳理与研究，将其分为了7大类别：协议DAO、资助DAO、投资DAO、艺术收藏DAO、社交DAO、媒体DAO、工具DAO。下文将具体阐释每类DAO组织的特色与运作。\n\n（一）协议DAO\n\n协议 DAO 多为与DeFi有关的DAO组织，旨在通过DAO具有的特性管理去中心化协议，例如借贷应用程序、去中心化交易平台或其他类型的 dApp。具有代表性的项目为：MakerDAO、Gnosis、Lido。\n\n1、MakerDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KEkgaqsk_pshTk2aU95uf.png?height=679&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，MakerDAO是以太坊上的一个去中心化稳定币平台，推出了第一个成功维持其挂钩的去中心化稳定币DAI。a16z, Dragonfly Capital, Paradigm, IOSG Ventures, Polychain, Febushi Capital, FBG等参与投资。\n\n其治理Token MKR，用于对 DAI 储蓄率等关键协议决策进行投票。如果成员要参与投票，MKR 所有者必须通过将Token转移到投票合约中来“锁定”。 投票是根据合约中锁定的 MKR 数量加权的，一般投票期间为3和7天。\n\nMaker DAO链上链下同时治理，目前有三种投票方式： 1）治理投票：只有被选中的治理负责人能够在投票页面发起投票，投票关于协议技术等的治理、共识等问题。 2）行政投票：关乎协议的技术层面决策，如添加或减少抵押品、调整金库等问题，任何人都可以提出投票，且通过连续批准投票方式进行（竞争提案可以随时被提出且同时投票）。 3）论坛投票：链下论坛，主要用于衡量社区的情绪和感知问题。\n\n2、Gnosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6zDelQEfxcELTLKl3iSpn.png?height=873&width=1905)\n\n成立于2015年，Gnosis是基于以太坊的预测市场，提供开源基础设施，由ConsenSys孵化。Gnosis由多种产品组成，包括Gnosis Safe、Gnosis Protocol和GnosisDAO，允许用户在以太坊上创建、交易和持有数字资产。\n\nGnosisDAO 将有效控制 15 万个 ETH 和 800 万个 GNO  Token，GNO  Token的归属期限为 8 年。关于治理的讨论将在自己的论坛上完成，任何人都可以加入， 但参与投票需要至少1个GNO。\n\n提出提案需要经过三个步骤： 1）提议：社区成员需要在论坛里提出自己的设想，并得到一定的社区支持，时间不限。 2）规划：正式提案，必须在论坛投票中获得一个相对多数票的结果，从而进入下一个阶段，为期5天。 3）共识：对于在最后阶段接受的提案，需要在Snapshot上进行投票，并有至少 4%的Token数量赞成投票，为期7天。\n\n3、Lido\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XWB7HYfC2MJS4qwrOWCTz.png?height=703&width=1429)\n\n成立于2020年，Lido DAO是一个为以太坊建立流动性质押服务的社区。a16z, 三箭资本，Paradigm，Alameda Research，Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Jump Trading等参与投资。\n\nLido DAO通过DAO成员治理。所有想法和建议最初都发布在研究论坛上，初始发布和提案推进之间的时长为 7 天。如果提案受到欢迎并且经过反馈被纳入，就会进入Snapshot投票阶段，需要至少总Token量的5%参与投票才能通过。\n\nSnapshot通过后在Aragon进行最终投票，时间为72小时。前48小时投支持或反对，后24小时可以修改投票。同样需要至少总Token量的5%的参与，且支持票数高于50%才能通过。\n\n同时，Lido DAO还有五个委员会：LNOSG（节点运营商子治理小组），LEGO（生态系统资助组织），奖励委员会（流动质押管理），RCC（资源和薪酬委员会），推荐计划委员会（推荐钱包和DeFi协议兼容Lido），分别管理组织的不同部分。\n\n（二）非营利性捐赠DAO\n\nGrant DAO 是非营利性捐赠DAO，在整个 Web3 生态系统中战略性地部署资产。社区将资金捐赠到捐赠池、并对资金的分配进行集体投票。代表项目有Gitcoin、Dorahacks。\n\n1、Gitcoin：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hUMOhi325Jbutpbc-KkoE.png?height=726&width=1430)\n\n成立于2017年，Gitcoin 是一个基于以太坊的去中心化协作平台。主要由6个产品构成：悬赏(Bounties)、黑客马拉松（Hackathon）、众筹捐款(Grant)、趣味问答(Quest)、感谢卡(Kudo)、孵化培训（Kernel）。悬赏、黑客马拉松、众筹捐款为优秀项目和优秀开发者提供资金支持。趣味问答、感谢卡和孵化培训帮助构建者/开发者/资助者学习Web3。\n\n其中，最重要的是众筹捐款板块。平台会定期开展捐助活动，每轮活动持续时间大概15天。各类项目(平台初步筛选之后)会陆续把自己的创意和计划等信息展示在平台上，供社区投资者们挑选资助，至今资助资金高达3500万美金。已知的投资机构有ConsenSys mesh, 1kx，Paradigm, The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures。\n\nGitcoinDAO通过Token GTC治理，只是GTC没有价格，单纯作为治理凭证，其中50%锁在DAO仓库，35%给到团队、投资人等，15%通过空投发放。\n\nGitcoinDAO有三个治理角色，各执其责： 1）管家：社区成员可以通过自荐的方式成为管家，由社区成员决定是否要将投票权委托给特定的管家。管家行使授予他们的投票权和领导工作来为社区服务。 2）委托人：持有 GTC 的社区成员，但希望通过将投票权委托给管家来行使他们的投票权。 3）贡献者：为DAO的工作做出贡献，将自己的时间、才能和专业知识投入到工作中，支持 Gitcoin DAO 的宗旨并帮助其实现目标，做出宝贵贡献的社区成员将获得 GTC奖励。\n\n拥有超过100万GTC就可以提出提议，过程如下 ： 1）提议：所有提议都要在论坛上公开至少5天，且有至少5个不相干管家提出建议。 2）投票：链下投票在Snapshot进行，为时5天；对于要挪用GTC的需要追加通过Tally4进行链上投票，为时5天（基本为再次通过）。 3）投票通过：需要至少250万GTC参与投票。\n\n同时，Gitcoin也有工作流制度，为特定工作领域的讨论、协作和推进提供了场所，是Gitcoin的原子单元，由一群积极从事与 Gitcoin 目的和基本意图一致的人组成。\n\n提出和生命周期： 1）非正式：工作流尚未提出建议 2）提案阶段：工作流已向治理提出正式的预算提案 3）活动：工作流预算和目标已获得治理批准 4）已更新：工作流已更新或正在接受持续资助 5）存档：工作流已被取消\n\n2、DoraHacks\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WzNfoUca-PjB_ItIT3zH.png?height=702&width=1429)\n\n成立于2015年，DoraHacks是一个去中心化开源开发者社区，也是全球最活跃的极客组织之一。产品包括Grant，Buidl，Hackathon，Bounty。DoraHacks以举办黑客马拉松和资助Web3初创公司而闻名。投资机构包括Binance Labs，FTX Vetures, Liberty Ventures, Circle Ventures, Gemini Frontier Fund, Sky9 Capital，Amber Group。\n\nDoraHacks 在今年早些时候推出了 Dora Grant DAO，并从 30 多个合作伙伴那里筹集了 500 万美元，计划为更多的黑客马拉松项目提供赠款。同时，其专门用来支持黑客松的Hackathon DAO也于今年成立。\n\nDoraHacks的社区在Discord进行讨论和监督资金分配，成员可以随时报告事件并寻求 DoraHacks 的帮助。DoraHacks 团队将通过在 Discord中计算集体决策与社区治理数据来采取相应的行动，以优化透明度和运营。\n\n（三）投资DAO\n\n投资DAO通过汇聚社区的基金，用于投资早期的 Web3 初创公司、协议等。代表性项目有The LAO、MetaCartel Ventures。\n\n1、The LAO：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IkxpBsYFqRJdu9XcwRtPE.png?height=722&width=1428)\n\nThe LAO 是美国特拉华州合法的有限责任实体、营利性的DAO，通过OpenLaw（OpenLaw 是一个能够创建「智能」法律协议的项目，为所有人提供了一种简单的方法来引用和触发基于以太坊的智能合约来管理合约承诺）实现，并于 2019 年在 Tribute Lab 的支持下成立。通过MolochDAO V2的方式进行治理。\n\nMolochDAO V2 具有基于区块链的治理模型和博弈论设计，是一个投票加权的多重签名智能合约，只要有超过50%的人投票就可以通过提案。同时，该合约具有怒退「rage quit」机制，让成员在退出时能获得与其投票比重相当的托管资金比例。成员对 DAO的表现或管理不满意，可以随时选择怒退。\n\nThe LAO 投资者成员数量所设上线为100名，投资者需要通过KYC后购买代表 The LAO 所有权的「LAO Units」加入，每单位「LAO Units」的价格为 310 ETH，购买后成员将获得 0.9% 的 The LAO 投票权，以及获得 0.9% 投资收益的权利，每个成员最多只能购买 9 个单位的「LAO Units」。\n\n与传统基金相比，由于没有 GP，并且成员完全控制所有投资决策和治理，因此没有人有权进行套利。\n\nThe LAO的投资过程：\n\n寻源：任何成员都可以提名一个或多个项目，通过 The LAO DApp 申请考虑； 尽职调查：没有正式的尽职调查程序，会员可以在投票前自行进行； 费用：DAO和成员需负担即将产生的费用，但他们面临的日常费用是由服务提供商按季度支付的； 投资条款：每项通过投资的条款均通过投票确定。\n\n作为有限责任实体的 The LAO 将遵守美国法律，限制成员的责任，并帮助澄清他们之间的关系，从而使该实体和持有劳资关系条例实益权益的人无须重复缴税。\n\n2、MetaCartel Ventures\n\n成立于2018， MetaCartel Ventures对早期DApp进行投资，现在拥有 60 多个 DAO 参与者，以及超过 800 名社区成员。投资机构包括1kx, P2P Capital, Zee Prime Capital, KR1, Stake Capital等。\n\nMetaCartel Ventures作为MetaCartelDAO的一个盈利性投资和法人实体，是一家特拉华州的有限责任公司。通过Grimoire，一份有限责任公司（LLC）协议，构成 DAO 成员之间自愿的、具有法律约束力的协议。通过 LLC，MetaCartel Ventures能够签订法律合同并参与投资机会，而不会承担超出 DAO 资本的个人责任风险。它还将允许注册的法人实体参与 DAO 以及向 DAO 发行证券。\n\n加入MetaCartel需要得到内部成员的支持和评估，并且MCV成员会在链上提交提案并进行投票。同时，其成员仅对DAO的资产来向公司债权人承担债务责任。\n\n其成员被分为三类： 1）法师：由Web3的61位从业者构成，角色类似于GP。积极参与管理工作，负责进行尽职调查、提出提案和投票权。 2）地精：其他类组织成员，可以提出提案和拥有投票权，不需要积极参与DAO组织。 3）召唤者：DAO中的运营代表，执行由法师监督的法律、财务和协调任务，但他们不一定是 DAO 的成员。\n\nMCV在链上治理中也采用OpenLaw与MolochDAO开发的MolochDAOv2智能合约。虽然MCV的筹款和资产管理发生在链上，但它的许多决策通过链下社区沟通渠道进行协调，如群组聊天、视频会议和面对面会议等，使得成员之间在链上提案之前就有了一定共识。\n\nMetaCartel的投资过程： 1）排队：提交提案与信息，同时确认预计质押多少Token换取股份，这个股份代表了你在这个DAO中的权益，包括了投票权，收益权等。 2）投票期：每个提案有7天的投票期，51%即可通过，每天最多可以提交5个方案。 3）缓冲期：投票期截止后有7天时间的缓冲期，届时不同意的人可以随时退出DAO，拿回自己的Token。如果大部分成员赞成你的提案，那么你就被接受进入DAO，你所贡献的股份正式进入DAO的公会银行。如果提案失败则燃烧股份赎回Token。 \\*公会银行是是DAO的公共基金，由全体成员共同创建、管理和所有。资金来源为成员进入DAO之前所抵押的Token, 是DAO的业务收入，资金用途一般包括收益分配或集体投资。 4）待处理：缓冲期结束后，提案进入待处理阶段，可由任何一名成员进行处理，实现该提案的目标（例如，分配份额、接受贡献）。 5）完成：凡是处理完的提案会与其他所有呈最终状态的提案一起记录在 DAO 内（IPFS上）。\n\n![Metacartel投票过程图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gi963BTSlQ8y_XttA0mj9.png?height=630&width=1116)\n\n（四）艺术收藏DAO\n\nCollector DAO 的主要目的是让成员将资金集中在一起，以便社区可以将国库资金投资于蓝筹 NFT 艺术品和其他收藏品，每个成员拥有与其个人投资相对应的份额。\n\n例如Pleasr DAO，于2021年成立，由A16z, Mechanism Capital, BitDAO投资，其成员由DeFi领头人、早期NFT收集者和艺术家组成，绝大部分成员实行匿名制，致力于购买和收集有代表性的NFT。\n\n其成立之初是为了在拍卖中买下加密艺术家 pplpleasr 创作的动画 NFT x\\*y=k （[https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623）](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623%EF%BC%89) ，该 NFT 是为了庆祝 Uniswap V3 的发布而创作的，拍卖的收益将作为慈善捐款赠与美国亚裔和太平洋岛民社区以及其他少数群体。\n\n拍卖时汇集的 40 多名成员在拍卖成功后并没有解散，而是发行了治理Token PEEPS，并按比例分给贡献者，持有者共同享有 DAO 旗下的 NFT 所有权。每个成员通过群聊参与 DAO 的治理。\n\n目前Pleasr DAO正在尝试数字和社区艺术所有权的新概念，将标志性的作品分拆给社区并由社区拥有，如今已有11个NFT收藏品。其中包括具有代表性的Doge表情包图片被PleasrDAO以1696ETH（550万美金）拍下，并以碎片化NFT形式分成了170份。\n\n该团队的愿景除了投资 NFT，还包括成为早期 NFT 项目的天使投资人以及孵化器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suZ5vO_PjD-NzDaDDt1s-.png?height=1037&width=1072)\n\n（五）社交DAO\n\n社交 DAO是专注于 DAO 的自组织社区，将志同道合的个人（如建设者、艺术家和创意人员）聚集在一起。虽然社交 DAO 以社区为中心，但它们通常存在进入门槛，拥有特定数量的Token、拥有 NFT 或被邀请。\n\n例如Friends with Benefits，成立于2020年9月，早期以社交实验的形式存在，加入需要提交书面申请并由社区成员投票，成为正式会员需要持有75个FWB才能加入，解锁整个生态，而成为本地会员只需要5个FWB，解锁城市和活动板块。\n\n作为一个线上社区，FBW是首个给社区成员提供线下见面交流场景的DAO组织，且非论坛、集会、商业活动等形式，而更像朋友间的聚会，连接线上身份以及线下生活。\n\n目前Friends with Benefits有3000名成员。投资机构包括A16z, Kindred Ventures, Spark Capital, Variant Fund。\n\n社区主要通过Discord进行，拥有包括学习区、艺术区、创意区、交易区、生活区，包括音乐、游戏、影视制作、科技学习、市场资讯、美食等上百个频道。\n\nFriends with Benefits创建了四个核心团队：治理、董事会、团队负责人和贡献者。 1）治理：由所有FWB持有者组成，通过Snapshot投票对DAO进行优化，并参与FWB的治理渠道和论坛。 2）董事会：由工作人员、社区成员和顾问组成，他们专注于社区建设战略以及社区参与和教育。 3）团队负责人：用来管理贡献者团队的专业领导者，他们根据对项目的贡献来选择潜在团队成员。负责人有权设定关键优先事项，分配赏金或奖励预算，并最终为团队的成功负责。潜在团队成员获得USDC工资以及Token赠款，以确保问责制和奖励创新。 4）贡献者：做出贡献的成员 — 根据技能和兴趣加入的专业Token持有者。FWB中目前存在的团队有产品、编辑和会员。贡献者根据他们为社区做出的贡献水平获得奖励。\n\n其他管理机制： -团队负责人每周都会与另一位董事会成员或顾问会面，分享优先事项、挑战和 KPI。 -团队负责人和董事会每月通过“市政厅”向全体治理部门报告，向所有成员提供最新进展和社区讨论。 -每个团队都会根据快照提案获得季度性预算，用于团队雇用和其它投资。 -每个团队负责人都有固定薪水，而贡献者则根据他们的相对贡献按比例分享剩余资金。 -贡献者使用Coordinape或Sourcecred等工具根据其价值获得报酬。\n\n（六）媒体DAO\n\n媒体DAO的目的是重塑内容平台，不依赖于广告收入而是以Token激励创作者和消费者。\n\n例如ForeFront，社交Token领域的信息聚合网站，2020年8月成立，目前几乎收录了所有的DAO和个人社交Token项目数据，任何成员都可以申请成为贡献者，并根据贡献每月拿到Token奖励。由1kx, MetaCartel Ventures，Scalar Capital, ConsenSys等投资。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-TV978UtFfjLwcQRDE2f.png?height=695&width=1428)\n\nForefront有6个核心成员，1311个Token持有者，成员在Discord上交流，拥有100个以上FF解锁治理与投票频道。\n\nForefront的治理结合去中心化，且通过三个原则来治理团队： 1）Forefront论坛：一个两周一次的现场讨论论坛，召集核心员工、团队管理员和所有活跃的贡献者，确保主权个人和团体的行动与整个 DAO 社区的使命和优先事项相一致； 2）决策空间版图：明确授予所有核心角色（员工、领导、协调员和团队管理员）和工作组的特定决策权限和约束； 3）OKR 和反思时期：不同类别的成员制定月、季度、年为单位的目标；\n\n同时，Forefront的成员分为四个类别： 1）核心员工和中心：为 DAO 路线图、Token经济学、使命和愿景的一般决策制定政策和框架。 2）工作组：工作组（团队）是 DAO 的基本“单元”。 他们有能力决定和处理其领域内的事务，其成员通过内部投票过程达成一致。 3）贡献者：通过独立的目标和个人贡献为组织出力，积攒自己贡献值。 4）社区：所有其他成员，参与投票治理，社区活动等。\n\n（七）工具DAO\n\n此类DAO是帮助成立、管理DAO组织的工具类DAO，使得组织内的计算与运转更为便利。\n\n1、Aragon：\n\nAragon是一个开源、非营利性的区块链协议，旨在简化 Dapp、区块链协议和DAO的创建和管理。 2017年融资2400万美金，旨在通过其对通用业务功能的模块化方法，获得安全、简单、可定制、透明，且能够帮助开发和社区保证智能合约效益的工具。\n\nAragon目前提供四个解决方案： Aragon App：DAO创建、SDK、智能合约和设计系统 Aragon Client：社区筹集资金、支付贡献者、共同治理等平台 Aragon Voice：无gas费用、可验证的DAO投票 Vocdoni：为各类企业提供最安全、可普遍验证和可扩展的数字投票协议，用于组织任何类型的投票过程，并保证完整性\n\nAragon 由 Aragon Network DAO通过ANT Token进行治理，由五个部分组成： 1）主DAO：对所有Token持有者开放，对DAO的金库投资做出提案和投票，同时治理社区。 2）执行子DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进整个 AN DAO 的战略调整，并从 Sub-DAO 的金库（运营金库）中分配资金。 3）合规性子 DAO：由选举产生的委员会，促进关于道德、风险和可持续性的管理，并拥有保护网络的否决权。 4）技术委员会：由选举产生的委员会，检查和整合代码提交，并根据需要组织技术审计。 5）Aragon法庭：争议解决机制，使所有 ANT 持有者能够反对恶意提案并抵御 51% 攻击。\n\n2、Syndicate\n\nSyndicate成立于 2021 年，是一个去中心化投资协议和社交网络平台，用于快速启动投资DAO组织，成员通过共享金库、智能合约和Token来投票。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 5 月推出第一个社区赋权 DAO；6月推出了Komorebi Collective 和 Audacity，在经济上支持代表性不足的社区，分别用于投资加密行业的女性创业和黑人创业。\n\nSyndicate于 2021 年 9 月完成由 a16z 领投的 2000 万美元 A 轮融资，Coinbase 等超过 150 个投资方参投。\n\n今年1 月份，Syndicate推出了 Web3 Investment Clubs 产品，支持Token、NFT以及区块链外初创企业和资产的投资，可以关联法律实体、开设银行账户并发行K-1，并且可以和任何 DAO和Web3工具（如Gnosis、Snapshot等）合在一起使用。\n\nSyndicate 的智能合约套件可以引导用户完成将他们的俱乐部与法人实体正式化的过程，并处理诸如设置银行账户和获取税表等事项。在平台上线的三周内就帮助创立了450个新的投资DAO，三个月内成立了1000+投资DAO。\n\n3、Coordinape\n\nCoordinape由Yearn Finance的团队打造，其目的是将DAO成员的薪酬管理公开透明，且提供一个公平的贡献奖励分配系统。\n\n它最核心的功能能就是礼物圈，Gift Circle。首先，参与同一个项目或者工作组的人成立一个Circle，设定预算和时间纪元（Epoch），所有参与者手里持有相同的GIVE。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fWpcSeVlpH312ZC2MR5KY.png?height=785&width=1430)\n\n在纪元中，每个人都可以描述自己本段时间做了什么，然后选择自己合作过的伙伴（可选）。进入送礼阶段，可以将自己手中的GIVE分发给你认为做出了贡献的成员。当分配时间结束，没有给出的GIVE会燃烧，而结果会导出CSV同步到管理成员。同时，Coordinape的每个纪元都会生成一个社交图谱，显示出成员之间的赠与关系、以及每个人收到的GIVE。\n\n目前，Bankless, PoolTogether, 以及本文所提到的Forefront等项目都在使用Coordinape。\n\nCoordinate实现了让成员掌握资金分配的决策权，是DAO管理工具的进步。但随着人员变多，每个人是否能够明确描述自己的职责和贡献将成为一个难点。\n\n章节总结： 通过梳理以上几大类型的DAO项目，我们可以清晰的看到DAO不同细分赛道正在逐渐完善。\n\n通过分析他们各自的治理模型，我们不难发现这些不同类型的组织最大的共性，就是已有一个可行的DAO社区架构和治理方式雏形：通过将社区成员进行角色分配来解决完全去中心化的效率和专业性分配问题。\n\n随着DAO组织的发展，未来我们一定会看到更多大规模的自治社区出现，但随着行业人数的增加和体量的翻倍，DAO的发展也会面临很多挑战。\n\n### 三、目前DAO面临的一些问题\n\n1、DAO并不适用于全部组织形态\n\n不难发现，以上众多DAO项目存在一个共同点：所有的投票或者提案都需要几天甚至更长的时间才能通过完成。也许未来会有多种工具用以提高决策效率，但是目前来说，DAO的去中心化治理只适用于不紧急的事件。\n\n但是在各类组织形态中，有些事项或组织则需要快速决策以达到目标，不会因为时间问题耽误进展，这也是未来中心化与去中心化将是并存关系的原因。\n\n所以，想要实行DAO治理前，要判断组织性质或者项目所处阶段是否适合才能让其良性向前。\n\n1. DAO面临培养成员归属感的问题\n\nDAO中的归属感不止来源于共识，还来源于成员之间的协作与联系。\n\n根据邓巴的理论极限，当一个群组的规模超过150人，与其他成员的联系以及归属感建立都会变得非常困难。这对很多新成员来说非常不友好。DAO的规模若想持续增长与扩大，就不得不在此层面做出一定的改进。\n\n1. 法务与税务问题\n\n随着加密资产交易在全球的普及，各国都开始逐步建立围绕加密资产的税务法规。如果DAO被视为以税收为目的的实体，是否所有Token拥有者或者成员都是股东，需要根据组织的盈利分别收税？\n\n对于企业税收来说，美国目前已经有一个很完善的结构，可是当涉及加密资产和NFT等链上资产时，相关法规就变得非常模糊，迄今为止，美国国税局尚未就 DAO 的具体征税方式发布明确的指导。同时，除了税收之外，投资者也越来越担心他们对 DAO 的投资所产生的法律责任。\n\n目前，虽然佛蒙特州和怀俄明州两个州允许 DAO 在其州注册为 DAO 有限责任公司，与常规有限责任公司一样，为 DAO 成员提供有限责任利益，但如今的DAO组织绝大部分并非注册公司，所以法务与税务仍旧是需要解决的。\n\n四、未来值得关注的DAO类别\n\n从Web3的意识形态来看，DAO将是其主要组织形态，7 O’Clock Capital一直致力于Web3的投研分析，并支持优秀团队的创新开发与建设。DAO也是我们在Web3领域关注的重点。\n\n通过长期对DAO赛道的关注和研究，我们认为DAO的机会将出现在以下几个发展方向中：\n\n1、与人工智能相结合的DAO\n\n目前很多DAO组织并非完全在链上运行，依然依赖于Web2的沟通方式，如Discord，许多决策和投票也并非通过智能合约进行。成熟的DAO，其所有的决策、资产、交易和行为都应该通过各种辅助工具在链上自动完成。\n\n随着DAO工具的发展，未来我们一定能看到愈发流畅的智能化管理，如规则的制定，新成员的审核、发起提案、完成投票、发布任务、分发贡献等行为都不再需要人为因素的干涉，能够自动完成。\n\n例：Village DAO\n\nVillage DAO 是Consensys联合对话式人工智能公司LivePerson一起推出的去中心化客服平台，帮助各类web3公司解决客服人手不够问题，任何公司都可以直接在官网申请加入平台，通过后其用户就可以申请成为该公司的专家，通过解决其他人的问题获得奖励。\n\n钱包作为普通用户接触Web3世界的入口之一，Metamask就成为了Village DAO的首个客户，激励专家用户帮助新用户，降低应用使用门槛，吸引新人加入web3。\n\n2、大型机构投资或者有大品牌背书的DAO\n\n无论是个人层面还是基金角度来说，项目背后的投资机构和品牌背书都是不可忽视的重要因素。虽然不能完全规避风险，但相较于其他项目，拥有优质机构支持的组织风险会更低。同时，拥有更高知名度项目的DAO组织更容易达成共识，拥有更好的成员凝聚力。\n\n例：Apecoin DAO\n\nApecoin DAO由Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)无聊猿母公司Yuga Lab成立，通过推出APE Token，在申领页面分配给BAYC/MAYC成员，成立了DAO组织。而持有APE是ApeCoin DAO成员的唯一要求。\n\nAPE由ApeCoin DAO拥有和运营，每个Token持有者都可以对Yuga Lab未来的发展方向和决策，以及对生态系统基金的治理和使用进行投票。\n\n例：Decentraland DAO\n\nDecentraland作为Web3的元老级虚拟项目，其品牌知名度和影响力跨越整个行业。Decentraland DAO 是 Decentraland 中 MANA、NAMES 和 LAND 持有者的决策工具。 通过在 DAO 中的投票，社区可以发放赠款并对被禁名称、POI 和催化剂节点列表进行更改。\n\n3、普惠金融与DAO的结合\n\n普惠金融的主旨是让任何人都能参与金融、参与投资。从传统的投资角度来说，一级项目一般只有具有资金体量、专业人员和各类资源的机构可以参投，但通过与DAO组织结合，就可以实现普惠金融，让任何人都能参与大型项目的投资。\n\n例：Coinshift\n\nCoinshift 是一个为 DAO 和加密项目提供财务管理的平台，通过Gnosis Safe 的多重签名账户进行更好的DAO治理。目前，Coinshift 管理着 13 亿美元的资产以及来自 Consensys、Messari、Biconomy 和 Uniswap 等公司 8300 万美元的支出。\n\n投资机构包括Tiger Global ，红杉资本印度、Alameda Ventures、Spartan Group、Ethereal Ventures、Alpha Wave Capital、Hash key Capital、Quiet Capital、Polygon Ventures、Volt Capital 等。\n\n4、Web 3与DAO的结合\n\n作为Web3世界的主要组织形态，任何为治理、多元化等提供便利的DAO工具和社区项目都是未来的重点发展风口。他们类似于DAO赛道的基建，通过为组织者和成员带来更优质的管理机制和工具、更丝滑的使用体验，以及更加具有凝聚力的治理方式，为DAO组织带来更优质的Web3环境。\n\n例：Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth 是集链上社区讨论、投票和资助项目一体化的平台，使用 Commonwealth，任何人都可以创建一个社区，并使用加密原生论坛、链下治理、链上治理等工具。他们最近推出了 Common Chat，这类似于 Discord 的 Web3 迭代版本，所有Token社区现在都可以使用钱包登录 Common Chat ，并创建聊天、论坛和全栈治理。投资机构包括Dragonfly、Parafi、Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent 和 Balaji Srinivasan等。\n\n5、创新开放型DAO\n\n此类DAO是一种想法非常大胆或者边缘性创新的项目，突破了人类对一些事件的常规认知，例如一个国家的完全的线上治理等。虽然目前来看几乎不可能实现，但是这种打破常规的尝试也是未来非常值得关注的方向。\n\n## 结语\n\n很多人认为，2022是DAO组织的元年，但其实纵观DAO的发展历史，从2016年The DAO的出现开始，这种新型组织形态就一直不断地被人们所探索和挖掘。DAO跨越了国界、种族、信仰等围墙，将各类标签打碎，给予了我们一种无关地位与身份，回归单纯的共识的组织方式，这不仅是DAO组织者的愿景，更是我们期待的区块链技术带来的崭新世界。\n\n随着新冠的席卷，无意中也给予了DAO组织更快速的普及与实践机遇，孕育了去中心化协作的土壤，让人们对未来世界的合作方式有了更多的灵感和探索空间。\n\n7 O’Clock Capital作为区块链生态的参与者和建设者，将一直密切关注DAO的进展，正如我们期待Web3世界的拓展一样，每一个明天永远都充满各种可能性。\n\n7 O'Clock Capital是一家拥有**专业投研**与**顶尖咨询孵化**能力的**风险型投资基金**，致力于投资**顶级公链，Web3.0，DeFi，NFT，GameFi**等领域**基础设施和应用**，且通过敏锐的感知力发掘**新经济与边缘型技术创新**项目。目前已投项目**100+**，用多元化的服务能力**驱动**项目成长，成为被投项目生态的**核心参与者与建设者**，**在合规、融资、商业定位、品牌咨询和行业资源**等方面**赋能加速**，部分已投项目已成为**细分赛道龙头**。", "timestamp": 1658564196, "digest": "TO6ZKcX29WgVAxXLBzzoJNKsgKzPKL-5l1sOw6iiRFM", "contributor": "0xE7300ad06a85BB8d4F69D46fe41c9FC086139E01"}

He had got to do this because he was tired of his parents’ nagging (唠叨的) about his English study and did not want to go through it any longer. He couldn’t get along well with English and disliked joining in English classes because he thought his teacher ignored him on purpose. As a result, his score in each exam never added up to over 60.\n\n　　His partner was concerned about him very much. She understood exactly what he was suffering from, but entirely disagreed with his idea. In order to calm him down and settle his problem, she talked with him face to face and swapped (交换) a series of learning tips with him. The items she set down helped him find the highway to studying English well.\n\n　　The teenager was grateful and got great power from his friend’s words.

{"id": "21bd6JuZ7kRhMLi2KrAVe-EIHK970ATNd2PEjE3in0c", "title": "一周年巡礼：安全和迅速是cBridge长期的追求", "body": "*撰文：Morty*\n\n7 月 18 日，Celer 官方 Twitter 发布了一条推文：旗下产品 cBridge 跨链资金总量已经超过 95 亿美金。对于跨链桥赛道而言，这是一个极为难得的成绩，cBridge无疑已跻身跨链桥赛道T1行列。更值得一提的是，至今 cBridge 还未出现过安全事故。\n\n行至如今，cBridge 已经顺利走过一个年头。而于 2018 年成立的 Celer 已经是加密协议中的“活化石”。我们也可以在其协议名称「Celer」中领略到团队在其立项之初的初心和愿景。\n\n**在拉丁语中，Celer 意为「迅速」**。\n\n自问世之后，Celer 以技术作为驱动力，从状态通道做起，后又参与了 Rollup 技术的实践，致力于 Layer2 扩容领域。在多链格局初现苗头时，Celer 又在 2021 年 7 月推出了名为「cBridge」的跨链桥，并在之后的一年中陆续支持了 34 条公链和 129 种 Token 的资产/信息跨链。\n\n我们可以清晰直观地感受到：**Celer 所做之事都是为了用户能够更加「迅速」地完成链上操作——更迅速地使用区块链，更迅速地在各条区块链之间辗转腾挪，为投资者提供更加迅速的链上操作体验**。\n\n## 伊始：产品方向的转变\n\n多链并行发展是一个几乎所有人都看得到的结果。这一切都来源于以太坊在承接了大量用户后所展现出的性能不足。自 BSC 推出之后，大量公链推出的目标几乎都是为了承接来自以太坊的外溢流量。\n\nCeler 产品方向的转变也从那时开始。\n\nCeler 推出 cBridge 的愿景更多是为了解决链上用户日益增长的跨链刚需。**本质而言，cBridge 的推出依然在践行着 Celer 团队本身的理念——「迅速」，而 cBridge 的推出速度也印证了 Celer 技术团队在技术创新层面的实力**。\n\n一年后，cBridge 成绩如何？\n\n上文已经提到，在稳定的资产跨链和良好的用户体验，以及从未出现过安全问题的情况下，cBridge 跨链资金总量已经达到 95 亿美金，陆续支持了 34 条公链和 129 种 Token 的资产/信息跨链。\n\n而在跨链桥 TVL 总锁定价值层面，据 DeFiLlama 数据显示，目前 cBridge TVL 约 3 亿美金，最高 TVL 曾到达过 7.5 亿美金。TVL 大幅下跌的时间节点在 5 月左右，显然受到了加密市场 LUNA/UST 崩溃的影响。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hXsFcFnSuTF3w2QpREURo.png?height=608&width=1080)\n\n如果我们从 ETH 本位的角度来看 cBridge 的表现，就会发现 cBridge 的 TVL 与加密市场整体状况有着强关联性，且在加密市场下跌之时，用户使用率和采用量并没有受到非常严重的影响。在人们对于加密市场的信心稍稍恢复后，ETH 兑 cBridge TVL 的数量就会回升。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e1Z1t0VHwJalLxSK8PW_.png?height=613&width=1080)\n\n**对于选择 cBridge 的用户而言，其最大优势便是 Celer 团队在技术层面对于安全的考量和在人性层面对于安全的追求**。\n\n## 对安全的追求：cBridge 的制胜法宝\n\n在公链们各显神通的时候，一个不可忽视的事实是：**负责链与链之间资产跨链以及通信的跨链桥由于跨链技术的复杂性和不成熟，逐渐被黑客们当成了提款机**。\n\n2021 年 8 月，跨链互操作协议 Poly Network 遭到黑客攻击，使用该协议的 O3 Swap 遭受了严重的损失，总损失高达 6.1 亿美元。\n\n2022 年 1 月，Multichain 正式声明协议的跨链桥存在安全风险，部分代币存在被黑客攻击的风险，并敦促用户尽快取消授权。而 Qubit Finance ETH-BSC 跨链桥被黑客攻击，损失超过 8000 万美元。\n\n2022 年 2 月，以太坊和 Solana 两大区块链的重要跨链桥 (Wormhole) 被黑客攻击，损失超过 3.2 亿美元。\n\n2022 年 3 月，Axie Infinity 侧链 Ronin 验证者节点和 Axie DAO 验证者节点被破坏，导致在两笔交易中从 Ronin 桥接了 173600 ETH 和 2550 万美元的 USDC。\n\n......\n\n有关跨链桥的黑客事件不胜枚举，直至如今，跨链桥的相关事故仍在不断发生。而难能可贵的是，在推出的一年时间中，cBridge 从未曾出现过安全事件。\n\n关于安全，Celer 团队在这一年中也从未停下脚步：\n\n#### SGN 网络\n\n治理攻击是一个非常常见黑客攻击手段。在 Axie Infinity 侧链 Ronin 跨链桥被攻击的案例中我们可以看到，Ronin 验证者节点和 Axie DAO 验证者节点被破坏，黑客利用此漏洞拿走了桥中的 173600 枚 ETH 和价值 2550 万美元的 USDC。\n\n对此，Celer 团队的解决方案是使用状态守卫者网络（State Guardian Network，以下简称 SGN）来保障 cBridge 的安全性。由 Celer 创建的 SGN 是一条基于 Tendermint（PoS）的区块链，它将为 cBridge提供 Layer1 级别的安全保障。\n\n#### 中间延迟\n\n「中间延迟」是 Celer 专门设置的一个双重保障，跨链 DApp 可以在延迟的抉择上做出不同的选择和权衡。\n\n原因显而易见——因没有延迟而导致跨链桥瞬间被黑客搬空的例子也很常见，Celer 希望杜绝因一次交易而清空整个池子流动性的情况出现，从而降低桥的整体系统性风险。\n\n#### 风控系统\n\n在安全观念的执行中，Celer 团队也为 cBridge 设置了多道安全屏障：搭建风控系统（监控桥的整体流动性，资产信息以及变化）、限流（单位时间内不能超过某一个特定的阈值，超过了会顺延时递）、24 小时监控、200 万美金的 BUG 悬赏等。\n\n那么，加密世界存在绝对安全吗？答案是否定的。在这片黑暗森林中，没有人会向你保证“绝对安全”，但 Celer 团队对于安全的追求是长期的。只有坚持着对“绝对安全”的持续追求，Celer 所代表的「迅速」才会被更好地践行。\n\n## 升级：从应用到生态\n\n上文提及，在经历加密市场的崩溃后，链上需求逐步减少，跨链桥的采用率相应变低。本质原因则是链上利润不足，DeFi 无法为链上投资者提供与其面临风险一致的利润回报，投资者便也会丧失兴趣，不愿意将资金投入到 DeFi 当中。\n\n但当有足够的利润摆在人们面前时，投资者的链上活动和跨链行为便会迅速增长。Layer2 Arbitrum 奥德赛活动的火热便是一个很好的例子，在活动最热的时间点，Arbitrum 的链上 Gas 费用甚至超过了以太坊。\n\n不过，需要重视的是，**链上投资者对于跨链的需求是多层次且复杂的——从简单的资产跨链到信息跨链，再到对于构建跨链生态的需求。并且，跨链的频率和场景正在迅速增长。**\n\n为了匹配更丰富且复杂的跨链需求，正当时的 Celer 推出了 Celer 消息跨链框架（以下简称为 Celer IM）。**Celer IM 是面向开发者的工具和基础设施，即插即用，开发者不需要修改已部署合约的任何代码，只需要一个简单的合约插件便可以将原 DApp 转变为原生跨链 DApp，彻底打通应用层之间的壁垒**。\n\n一个很简单的例子便是：SushiSwap 的用户可以通过一次简单的交易将 Arbitrum 上的 ETH 交换为 BSC 上的 BNB。在交易背后，智能合约是如此执行的：\n\n* 通过 SushiSwap（Arbitrum）将 ETH 兑换为 USDT；\n\n\n* 作为 Celer IM 框架的一部分，Arbitrum 上的 USDT 通过 cBridge 桥接到 BSC；\n\n\n* 通过 Celer IM 向 SushiSwap（BSC）发送执行将 USDT 兑换为 BNB 的链间消息。\n\n当前大多支持多链的 DApp 的常见做法是通过简单地在多条链上复制相同的代码来实现，但每条链上的 DApp 的流动性、应用程序逻辑和状态彼此完全隔离。我们甚至可以将他们看作是两条链上两个不同的去中心化应用。如此一来，流动性/资金效率低便成为了无可争辩的事实。\n\n**Celer IM 允许 DApps 实现在多条链之间的流动性共享和连贯的应用程序逻辑，提升流动性/资金效率，在多链的格局下，践行着团队对于「迅速」的追求。**\n\n## 起航：成为跨链龙头\n\n在大航海时代之前，由于通讯技术和交通工具的不发达，每个文明就像一个孤岛，只与相邻的文明进行简单且直接的交流。而随着时间的推进，航海家们对于未知的探索，各个文明逐步被连接起来。就像如今的多链生态，随着以太坊性能的不足以及更多开发者对于高性能公链的追求，不断有新的公链正在被推出，而跨链桥便也成了刚需。\n\n**Celer 秉持着「安全至上，技术创新迅速」的追求，cBridge to C，Celer IM to B，双管齐下，搭建了愈发完善的区块链互操作基础设施，走入了我们的每一次跨链操作中**。\n\n也正如哥伦布所言，「世界属于勇者」，是亦步亦趋，还是勇敢去探索新的大陆，Celer 的选择是后者。对于 cBridge 而言，星辰大海的征途才刚刚开始。\n\n> cBbirdge一周年，为了感谢合作伙伴和用户的信任及支持，准备了 $23,000 cBridge 生日狂欢派对。奖励丰富，欢迎感兴趣的朋友参与。\n\n<https://twitter.com/CelerNetworkcn/status/1550300539505717248?s=20&t=8qM9DXklueMlDueVLY8eIg>\n\n***深潮 TechFlow 是由社区驱动的深度内容平台，致力于提供有价值的信息，有态度的思考。***\n\n> ***社区：***\n>\n> 公众号：深潮 TechFlow\n>\n> 订阅频道：<https://t.me/TechFlowDaily>\n>\n> 电报：<https://t.me/TechFlowPost>\n>\n> 推特：[@TechFlowPost](https://twitter.com/TechFlowPost)\n\n*进微信群添加助手微信：blocktheworld*", "timestamp": 1658565705, "digest": "xkPcbaLM9oAp660ZVoZG7ktM2tswQs3aGxw4oThPpKw", "contributor": "0x0E58bB9795a9D0F065e3a8Cc2aed2A63D6977d8A"}

Everyone have seen their parents renting a house or a car from someone. Or renting their house to someone. Renting a physical asset is very common and has a very easy process to do. \n\nIn the decentralised world, renting an asset can be a little bit tricky. Lands and houses in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world are NFTs. We all know what NFTs are and if you are not with this term, you can go to [this link](https://mirror.xyz/0x2d209040c031d4e2D4d9cb4D3aabf18F52260AB0/YLdBJP9rIqzVc2vYH4LTC5rUwSdAst96F5IN8QhpWIw) and have a look at my other article about this term. \n\nSo, what if you have an NFT land in a game and you want to rent it to someone and get some income from it? How can you do that with ERC 721 tokens? Is it really possible to do that?\n\nWell, in one word, NO. Renting an NFT is happening through centralised authorities like the game itself, and it is not submitted on the blockchain. So, what to do now? If you do not trust the centralised game or authority, what should you do?\n\n## ERC 4907: Rental NFT, ERC-721 User And Expires Extension\n\n[ERC 4907](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4907) is designed to rent NFTs on the blockchain. All the transactions are submitted on the blockchain and you can trust these transactions on the blockchain. In these situations, it makes sense to have separate roles that identify whether an address represents an “owner” or a “user” (renter from) and manage permissions to perform actions accordingly.\n\nSome projects already use this design scheme under different names such as “operator” or “controller” but as it becomes more and more prevalent, we need a unified standard to facilitate collaboration amongst all applications.\n\nFurthermore, applications of this model (such as renting) often demand that user addresses have only temporary access to using the NFT. Normally, this means the owner needs to submit two on-chain transactions, one to list a new address as the new user role at the start of the duration and one to reclaim the user role at the end. This is inefficient in both labour and gas and so an “expires” function is introduced that would facilitate the automatic end of a usage term without the need of a second transaction.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe Solidity interface should look like the code below:\n\n```\ninterface IERC4907 {\n\n    // Logged when the user of a NFT is changed or expires is changed\n    /// @notice Emitted when the `user` of an NFT or the `expires` of the `user` is changed\n    /// The zero address for user indicates that there is no user address\n    event UpdateUser(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed user, uint64 expires);\n\n    /// @notice set the user and expires of a NFT\n    /// @dev The zero address indicates there is no user\n    /// Throws if `tokenId` is not valid NFT\n    /// @param user  The new user of the NFT\n    /// @param expires  UNIX timestamp, The new user could use the NFT before expires\n    function setUser(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint64 expires) external;\n\n    /// @notice Get the user address of an NFT\n    /// @dev The zero address indicates that there is no user or the user is expired\n    /// @param tokenId The NFT to get the user address for\n    /// @return The user address for this NFT\n    function userOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns(address);\n\n    /// @notice Get the user expires of an NFT\n    /// @dev The zero value indicates that there is no user\n    /// @param tokenId The NFT to get the user expires for\n    /// @return The user expires for this NFT\n    function userExpires(uint256 tokenId) external view returns(uint256);\n}\n```\n\nThe `userOf(uint256 tokenId)` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`.\n\nThe `userExpires(uint256 tokenId)` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`.\n\nThe `setUser(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint64 expires)` function MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.\n\nThe `UpdateUser` event MUST be emitted when a user address is changed or the user expires is changed.\n\nThe `supportsInterface` method MUST return `true` when called with `0xad092b5c`.", "timestamp": 1658567262, "digest": "Upu8EhsC_rO9_4UabBn7pUVNXRj4fcJz43g7_JfGDbo", "contributor": "0x2d209040c031d4e2D4d9cb4D3aabf18F52260AB0"}

In July last year, I registered the Ens domain name--metamess.eth, which is the 0x address of the burned POAPs. At that time, Ens had not issued token yet. Of course, I didn’t know it would issue token. I started collecting POAP in May last year, which was earlier than registering the Ens domain name. I think it\\`s cool to enter the blockchain world and have your own domain name. So, like the Ens domain name, POAP's collection is purely based on love for it. I remember that the first POAP was the Metazoo POAP on Decentraland, and knowing POAP also started from here. It deepened my understanding of the blockchain:  the non-tamperable on-chain credentials can also be designed as badges for event participation certificates as souvenirs, What a great thing that is! From then on, I got addicted to it and started the journey of collecting POAPs.\n\nSince then, I took time every day to see where there are POAPs in the DCL scene, such as DG Casino, Metazoo, Tensaistudio, etc. They often hold events and there are POAPs to claim.Later, I found that can create event on <https://poap.xyz> and apply for badges to distribute to event participants. From the end of June to the beginning of July 2021, I created my first event in DCL and applied for the first POAP. This event is to celebrate\"100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China\",it is a major event in our country. I want to leave a mark on the blockchain for this event. I established my own metaverse exhibition in DCL. At that time, I applied for 100 POAPs. This event was very popular at the time. , everyone was very interested in the event and the POAP I designed.I was very surprised that their love is so crazy, they want to spend money to buy the POAP I designed, and my answer is: this is only for event vouchers and commemorations, not for commercial purposes! This first event was very successful.which inspired me a lot. Since then, I have also created several events at <https://poap.xyz>. The following is a list of these events:\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3353](https://poap.gallery/event/3353)\n\n![The 100th Anniversary of the Founding of The Communist Party of China](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V2g4CdB_wITcT6QGR_Dt9.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3555](https://poap.gallery/event/3555)\n\n![                  『☭』庆祝中国共产党成立100周年-- DCL线上纪念活动 01-Jul-2021                                         I remember that after applying for this POAP, Mr worthalter told me that I must use English next time, otherwise I will not pass it. Your regulations have not stated that you must use English! I've also seen a lot of POAPs in other languages ​​so far!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bAa7fbkdlGYfiCGDM25aN.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/3716](https://poap.gallery/event/3716)\n\n![Gitman](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J_IpzY0BBI7OBtXusD46_.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/5517](https://poap.gallery/event/5517)\n\n![Celebration for 1000 POAPs collection 11-Aug-2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0JmuPnMEZZgEaChJRrlzE.png?height=911&width=1920)\n\n[https://poap.gallery/event/7590](https://poap.gallery/event/7590)\n\n![MetaMess Twitter followers 1K 15-Sep-2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o5oQaNmTYHLjxFLYD_qna.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![Someone said to buy the POAP I designed](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ydxjoMJe7J-iQMzLw9Io3.png?height=623&width=563)\n\nAlong with it, day after day, I madly collect POAPs, it has become a part of my life, and I am keen to collect it. In the end, it has affected my work and life, and I am still so fascinated by it. One day, a friend told me that I was ranked\nNo. 1 in the number of POAPs on a leaderboard website. At that time, my number was 1000. I was very surprised about it. I don't know who built a special one for this--The ranking list of the number of POAPs, followed by many people sprinting for the ranking, many people joined the POAP collection madly, and therefore, an event I created is about my POAP number exceeded 1000, for I designed a badge that reached 1000 poaps, and also applied for 1000 POAP Claim links to distribute those POAPs to friends who participated in the event. I should be the first person to reach 1000 POAPs. At the same time, the number of POAP Wallets also started. The geometric growth, I vaguely remember that it was 200,000 addresses, and now it is 900,000 addresses. My POAPs ranked No. 1 for a long time in 2021. Therefore, in the Chinese community, many POAP collectors know the name MetaMess.\n\n![As of July 19, 2022, my number of POAPs is 3847, ranking 8th](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/unYke56GCLtixZ8lVD2Sv.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\nAs time comes to October 2021, this was a turning point for me to POAP. Mr worthalter--the CEO of POAP, sent an email to the publisher who created the event with his own mailbox. The issuer will distribute an Early issuers poap. At that time, I was very happy to receive this email from the CEO himself, but a few days later, some friends have received the second email with the Poap Claim Link, but I still hadn't received it, and then I started to get confused. Why some people who only created one event received this it, and some who only created events but failed to apply also claimed this poap, and then I sent an email to Mr worthalter, It's also didn\\`t receive his reply. Next day, I DM him a message on Discord, and immediately blocked me. I was baffled by this. Finally, I went to POAP's Discord public channel general, just typed “Hi”, as soon as I sent it, I was kicked from POAP Discord. Now, I feel very angry and frustrated at the moment, why am I the person who would like to participated in the building of the POAP, was treated so unfairly.Of course it's not just me who has been kicked, as far as I know, those who speak differently to you will be removed from the POAP community. Later, I can only found the official POAP mod or staff to help me with this matter, but they also don't know why didn't distribute this early issuer poap to me and didn't respond at the end.  Since then, I have been disappointed with POAP.\n\n![A--Screenshot of an email Mr worthalter sent me in Oct 13, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5fUwZEVi3CuN5HqweZ4X1.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![B--Screenshot of my email to Mr worthalter，but no response Oct 14, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I7nXX5zwql8_UHGkACgOm.png?height=973&width=1920)\n\n![ C--I DM Mr worthalter and got blocked in Oct 15, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qTxmtVqX4HeAFKVsADUD8.png?height=969&width=1920)\n\nAccording to the official statement at that time, it was said that you must have this Early issuers poap in order to create an event. For this reason, in November 2021, I used another account address to spend 518 xdai to bought an Early issuer poap on the [Epor.io](http://Epor.io) market，But at that moment I no longer have the idea of ​​creating POAP events. In addition, in December, there was a big crash in the cryptocurrency market, and the digital currency I bought also suffered serious losses. When the market was at its worst this year, I sold my all currency assets that lost a lot of money， However, on July 8, 2022, the [Epor.io](http://Epor.io) website that POAP official supported also stole my Early issuers poap because of a loophole, and was sold by the thieves, and they did not roll it back for me. Because of this, I began to slow down the pace of collecting POAPs. At the end of last year, the number of POAPs reached 3,500 (starting from the end of April 2021), and as of July 2022, the total number of POAPs is 3847 POAPs, which means that I only collected 347 POAPs in the 7 months of 2022. Because of the above events, I have already only collect POAP occasionally, and now, on the rank leaderboard, the people above me are all above 4700+,They were just behind me last year!\n\nNow, just a few days ago, you burned all the 3847 POAPs in my address and threw them to the black hole address, and my whole person collapsed, because those POAPs were collected by me day and night, reversing my work and rest time. Go to DCL to play games, go to various Discord project parties to listen to AMA meetings, spend hundreds of days in Coingecko dapp to click and sign in to get 4000 points and spend them in exchange for Coingecko's POAPs, purchased in the exchange market, there are also many POAPs that may launch airdrops, such as METAMASK, SSV,The Graph,etc. POAP for my donation to the [Gitcoin.io](http://Gitcoin.io) Grant-initiated project--(I also made two donations to POAP from G11 and G12 last year, totaling $15.) and more I created POAPs for my own events, and so on. Every POAP has a story about me and them. every POAP is unique. they have been bound to my soul like a body, but now they are being torn apart and strangled at will.Those days and nights, sleepless for collect POAPs. My health was also damaged because of this, and I went to the hospital because of chest pains.Can you understand the bitterness? Now all POAPs have been burned by your merciless fire! Is it just so ruthless, unreasonable, rude, and doing things so ridiculous? You think that this is an abnormal frequency, you discriminate against the Chinese, and you may have difficulty understanding how diligent the Chinese are! I can tell you that China's rising is the result of our sacrifice of sleep time, time with our family, and our own health in exchange for it!\n\n![All POAPs of my address have been burned in July 19, 2022 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAQGLXiYR6tEEdV94aAe7.jpg?height=1624&width=750)\n\n \n And those addresses that have more than a dozen or dozens of POAPs with the same event, why don't you destroy them, those trading website you support have loopholes and thus steal our POAPs, and tens of thousands of POAPs were stolen by hackers, and did not respond to this, issued no warnings and technical countermeasures to the hackers! No penalty for thieves' addresses! No response to losses caused by [Epor.io](http://Epor.io), which you support! The absurd accidents keep happening, and you just blindly evade responsibility and shirk responsibility! And for those of us who are defenseless, give our time, money and hard work, and love your POAP collectors, to be unreasonable, rude, and ruthless, there is no notification from beginning to end, no reasonable explanation, no logical procedure, no Compliant rules and regulations, just unreasonably burn down the POAPs that I used to be crazy about and love, this is like a fatal shot! What is the difference between this and the current shootings in the United States that are shooting and killing innocent civilians! You don't certify the contributions of our collectors, nor do you improve the technology to prevent hackers from stealing, but you shamelessly named farmers for POAP collectors and put black hands on our necks,What are your so-called criteria for judging illegal operations? So far there is no standard! But what you have done to us？we Chinese POAP collectors can debate with you!\n\nYou manage a decentralized business in a centralized and abusive way, get out of the way, web3 does not welcome you!\n\nYou are the disgrace of the blockchain, the dictator, the devil, your actions go against the spirit of blockchain！\n\nYou are indiscriminate, disregarding people's feelings, abusing power, acting recklessly, and destroying humanity!\n\nYou are not qualified to reshape the world in the blockchain world!

Однако отсутствует соответствующий подписанный представителями этих народов договор или соглашение.\n\n10 июля 1918 года принимала Конституцию РСФСР, по своему содержанию являющаяся Конституцией унитарного государства, хотя в ней декларировалось создание государства как федерации советских республик. В данной Конституции вообще нет упоминания, кто является субъектом федерации, и кто его создал.\n\nДоговор об образовании СССР РСФСР подписала от имени всех населяющих Российскую империю народов, в том числе и от имени чеченского народа, ранее включённого в состав империи насильственным путём. При этом мнения чеченского народа никто не спрашивал и об этом нет каких-либо юридических документов.\n\n26 июня 1990г. РСФСР приняла Декларацию о государственном суверенитете, в которой провозглашалось верховенство законодательства России над законодательством СССР. И это был первый шаг на пути развала союзного государства-СССР.\n\n8 декабря 1991г. руководители РСФСР, Украинской ССР и Белорусской ССР заключили соглашение о создании СНГ, в котором провозглашалось упразднение СССР. Союз ССР как субъект международного права и геополитическая реальность прекращает своё существование, говорится в документе, подписанном сторонами.\n\nЭто решение было незаконным, так как согласно условиям Договора об образовании СССР 1922 года субъекты Союза могли лишь денонсировать Договор (т.е. выйти из Союза), но не могли его ликвидировать, так как учреждали Союз четыре республики, а не три, и в последующем к Союзу присоединились ещё 8 союзных республик. Мнение остальных республик Россия, Белоруссия и Украина проигнорировали.\n\n21 декабря 1991 года состоялась Алма-Атинская встреча глав республики бывшего Союза ССР, на которой к Соглашению от 8 декабря 1991 года присоединились ещё 8 республик (кроме Республики Грузия).\n\nЭтот акт был придать видимость законности Беловежскому Соглашению, но это была видимость, так как сделано это задним числом.\n\nВ Алма-Ате было принято решение о том, что другие республики, составляющие СССР, поддерживают стремление России стать правопреемницей СССР по международным обязательствам, в частности, признают её право занять место в Совете Безопасности ООН.\n\nПоскольку союзными республиками, подписавшими, либо присоединившимся к СНГ, Конституция и законодательство СССР не признаётся, получается, что появление этих республик и их существование незаконно, поскольку республики Молдова, Казахстан, Узбекистан, Туркменистан и другие были образованы законами СССР и ранее они как самостоятельные государства не существовали. Их образовал СССР своими законами и лишь после этого они были включены в состав СССР.\n\nБолее того, в Декларации о создании СНГ РСФСР без согласования субъектов федерации прекращает на данной территории действия органов государственности и управления СССР, тем самым грубо нарушены основные положения Декларации основные положения о государственном суверенитете РСФСР, где РСФСР торжественно провозглашает о своём участии в составе единого и неделимого СССР. Проигнорированы и результаты мартовского 1991 года всенародного референдума народов РСФСР, абсолютно большинством голосов выразивших своё согласие быть в составе СССР.\n\nУчастником Алма-Атинской встречи, в нарушении всех норм права, выражена поддержка России быть правопреемником СССР в ООН, включая постоянное членство в Совете Безопасности и других международных организациях. Однако, как известно, СССР не присоединился к Венской конвенции о правопреемстве государства в отношении договоров от 23 августа 1978 года.\n\nИсходя из этого и других международных документов, следует, что Россия не имеет правовой основы быть правопреемником СССР в ООН и её организациях, особенно в Совете Безопасности ООН в качестве правопреемника СССР. И, прежде всего, это связано с тем, что народы бывшего СССР стремятся к реальной реализации своего права на самоопределение, выражая свою готовность и желание быть полноправными субъектами в Совете Безопасности, где требуется единогласие при принятии решения и где, пока ещё незаконно, сидит Россия в качестве его постоянного члена, поскольку, если любой народ (нация)бывшего СССР, не являющийся членом ООН, и желающий вступить в эту организацию, может стать членом ООН, если только на это согласится Россия. Однако никогда национальная политика России не позволяла и не позволит реальной реализации права народов на самоопределение, тем более стать членом ООН, и эта опасность, в основном, висит над народами СССР.\n\nРоссия, как имперская держава, нарушает, и будет нарушать основные права человека. Так, в нарушение Конституции СССР и закона СССР “О гражданстве СССР” Россия и другие участники создания СНГ в грубой форме лишили своих граждан гражданства СССР, что юридически означало автоматическое лишение их гражданства своих республик, поскольку согласно ст. 16 закона СССР “гражданстве СССР” от 1 декабря 1978 года, утрата гражданства влечёт за собой утрату гражданства союзной республики.\n\nОтсюда вытекает, что любые изменения государственного устройства, либо отношений сторон, подписавших соглашение о создании СНГ с другими государствами и международными организациями, не могут иметь юридической силы, поскольку нет субъектов-граждан эти республик.\n\nСледовательно, любые принятые этими государствами акты до принятия национального законодательства о гражданстве, прохождения всеми лицами процедуры гражданства и волеизъявления физических лиц, как граждан данного государства, не могут порождать правовых последствий ни для его граждан, ни для субъектов международного права.\n\nБолее того, с изменением правового статуса Российской Советской Федеративной Социалистической Республики на Российскую Федерацию в России не был проведён соответствующий референдум, либо новые выборы в высшие органы законодательной власти, не говоря уже о принятии новой Конституции, являющейся основой для существования любого государства.\n\nФизически устранив представительную законодательную власть в 1993 году, совершён очередной государственный переворот с применением военной силы и установлен Режим. Навязанная силовым принуждением Конституция составлена и принята не законодательным органом представительной власти, а военный диктаторским режимом. Участие физических лиц с паспортами и гражданством СССР, физически упразднённого в Декабре 1991г., ставит вне закона как саму Конституцию, так и избранников представительной и избирательной власти с юридической точки зрения как само государственное образование Российской Федерации-Россия, так и её высшие органы власти представляют собой правовой нонсенс.\n\nБольшие юридико-правовые нарушения были допущены в отношении Б.Ельцина. В 1991 году состоялись выборы Президента РСФСР, а только потом оформились полномочия и статус Президента Российской Федерации, причём без избрания “самого носителя верховной власти” через несоответствующую сущности Основного Закона процедуру принятия Конституции РФ-России в декабре 1993 года.\n\nПри этом юридически вакантное место Президента РФ оказалось занятым Президентом РСФСР. Ссылка на то, что РФ-Россия является правопреемницей РСФСР представляется большой правовой натяжкой, так как подобного рода констатации требуют закрепления в форме закона, принятого через институты непосредственной демократии.\n\nТаким образом, из анализа имеющихся фактов, существующих документов вытекает следующее:\n\n1. Незаконность создания РСФСР как федеративного государства, поскольку отсутствуют волеизъявление народов и юридические документы, подписанные народами о создании РСФСР и не определены субъекты федерации.\n2. Незаконность правопреемственности от СССР и пребывание РФ-России в Совете Безопасности ООН.\n3. Незаконность роспуска СССР создания СНГ.\n4. Незаконность государственного образования РФ-России.\n5. Нелегитимность высших органов власти и руководства РФ-России.\n\nОтсюда следует необходимость признания мировым сообществом, что:\n\n1. Российская угроза миру и народам исходит из того, что её государственное образование и власть формируется в результате переворотов и не могут соответствовать принципам и нормам международного права.\n2. Акт лишения СССР субъективности международного права, членство в Совете Безопасности ООН и объявление РСФСР (в последующем РФ-России) правопреемником СССР противоправны и явились причиной очередного государственного переворота в России, массовых репрессий против народов, геноцида, войн, народоубийств и что они состоялись с прямой санкции Генерального секретаря ООН и её Секретариата.\n3. Существует настоятельная необходимость и важность приведения государственного образования РФ-России и её высших эшелонов власти в правовое пространство в рамках международного права, для чего требуется:\n\nА). Немедленное принятие в рассмотрение Международным судом под эгидой ООН делав военной агрессии против Чеченской Республики Ичкерия.\n\nБ). Временный вывод РФ-России из Совета Безопасности ООН, создав международный орган по выработке программы и мер по приведению государственного образования РФ-России и её высших эшелонов власти к нормам международного права и законности.\n\nВ). До проведения программных мер правового восстановления Российского государства и его высших эшелонов государственной власти взять международный контроль и гарантии все народы, находящиеся в колониальной зависимости от России и принять к России санкции, предусмотренные нормами международного права.\n\nЮридическая справка к вопросу о легитимности российской власти в Чечении (ЧРИ)\n\nВ ходе многолетней кавказской войны России удалось захватить и присоединить к империи исконные чеченские земли и ввести там колониальный режим правления. Право России на владение и управление данной территорией основывалось именно на факте военного захвата.\n\nФевральская революция 1917 года свергла монархический режим в России. Власть перешла к Временному правительству, назначенному 4 Госдумой. Царь отрёкся от престола; сославшись на волю народа и решение Временного правительства. Последнее, в целях обеспечения законного правопорядка Российской государственной власти, обязывалось в кратчайшие сроки созвать Учредительное собрание.\n\nОднако 25 октября 1917 года старому стилю партия большевиков организовала государственный переворот в России. Временное правительство было распущено и объявлено вне закона, большевистский Петроградский Совет и ВРК 26 октября 1917 года в одностороннем порядке образовали новое российское правительство-СНК России. Однако СНК в свою очередь также подтвердил необходимость созыва учредительного собрания для обеспечения правопреемства государственной власти.\n\n5\\.01.1918г. Учредительное собрание начало свою работу, но большевики 6.01.1918г. распустили его, убедившись, что не в силах контролировать этот законно избранный народом для решения судьбы России орган. После этого вся полнота власти оказалась в руках большевистской партии и сформированных ею государственных органов.\n\n10\\.07.1918г. государственный переворот, совершённый большевиками, был закреплён Конституцией РСФСР, которая провозглашала, что РСФСР учреждается как федерация советских национальных республик, основанная на свободном союзе свободных наций, хотя ни волеизъявления народов, ни подписания договора о создании федерации не было.\n\nТаким образом, даже только основанное на захвате право Российской империи по владению и управлению Чеченией не перешло к РСФСР.\n\nБолее того, чеченский народ определил свой правовой статус, который был подтверждён 11 мая 1918 года принятием Декларации об образовании независимости республики Союза горцев Северного Кавказа и Дагестана (Горской республики), где подчёркивается, что народы Кавказа избрали национальное собрание, которое заявило об образовании Союза горцев Кавказа, как независимого государства.\n\nПричём территория данного государства простиралась от Чёрного до Каспийского морей. Данное государство уже было признано западными государствами, включая Турцию и Германию.\n\nОднако Горская республика была физически ликвидирована и больше за так называемый “советский период” истории народы Кавказа не смогли создать своё независимое государство, поскольку этому мешал великорусский шовинизм и национальная политика РСФСР, а впоследствии и СССР. В обращении Совета Народных Комиссаров к трудящимся мусульманам России устраивать свою национальную жизнь свободно и беспрепятственно. В данном документе заявлялось, что не от России и её революционного правительства ждёт нас порабощение, а от хищников европейского империализма, которые превратили нашу родину в расхищенную и обираемую колонию.\n\nОднако история показала, что всё произошло наоборот. Народы оказались порабощёнными Россией и СССР. начался геноцид и массовое истребление народов, особенно народов Кавказа. Чеченский народ лишился двух третей своих лучших представителей и оказался отброшенным на многие десятилетия назад в своём историческом развитии.\n\nДалее, рассматривая вопрос о легитимности российской власти в Чечении (ЧРИ), следует принять во внимание следующее:\n\nВ обращении к рабочим, солдатам и крестьянам 26.10.1917г. 2 Всероссийский съезд Советов провозгласил, что Советская власть обеспечит все нациям, населяющим Россию, подлинное право на самоопределение. В декларации прав народов России, принятой 2 ноября 1917 года правительством, руководимым Лениным, указывалось, что правительство обязывается способствовать реализации прав народов на самоопределение и образование самостоятельных государств. Однако в резолюции съезда Советов России “О федеральных учреждениях Российской республики” от 15 января 1918 года, принятой в одностороннем порядке без учёта национальных особенностей и волеизъявления народов, установившей основные положения Конституции РСФСР, указывалось, что РСФСР учреждается на основе добровольного союза народов России как федерации советских республик, но опять-таки, без соответствующего подписанного представителями народов договора или иного юридического документа.\n\nМежду тем, национально-государственное устройство чеченского народа, равно как и других народов, власти новой России, односторонне взяли в свои руки и происходило это устройство не с учётом волеизъявления народов, а с учётом политической конъюнктуры.\n\nТак, 21 января 1921 года декретом ВЦИК “Об Автономной Горской Социалистической Советской Республике” ряд горских народов Северного Кавказа волевым решением включены в состав данной республики. По национальному составу ГАССР не было результатом волеизъявления народов свидетельствует тот факт, что меньше, чем через год из состава ГАССР были выделены Кабардинский, Карачаевский и балкарский округа. 30.11.1922 года декретом ВЦИК “Об образовании автономной области Чечни” был выделен Чеченский округ, а постановлением ВЦИК от 7.07.1924 года Горская республика вообще была упразднена.\n\nХотя все декреты ВЦИК об объединениях народов принимались со ссылкой на волеизъявление народов, на самом деле их желания никто не спрашивал.  Чеченская автономная область в РСФСР появилась не как результат волеизъявления чеченского народа, а по декрету ВЦИК.\n\nВ январе 1934 года ВЦИК принял постановление о соединение о соединении Чеченской и Ингушкой автономных областей в единую Чечено-Ингушскую автономную область. Однако при этом объединении ингушский народ лишился значительной части своих исконных земель, а Владикавказ, бывший административным центром Ингушской АО и СОАО, перешёл под юрисдикцию Северной Осетии. Один только этот бесспорно доказывает, что при принятии решений российские власти исходили из своих собственных интересов, а не из учёта волеизъявления народов.\n\nНаконец, необходимо иметь в виду следующее. Конституция РСФСР 1918 года, по своей сути, являлась основным законом унитарного государства, хотя в ней декларировалось основание государства как федерации свободных советских национальных республик. В ней совершенно не упоминалось, кто же является субъектом федерации, и это не случайно: большевиками формальное федеральное устройство рассматривалось как тактический маневр, кратковременная уступка стремлению народов выйти из состава России, которую сами большевики до захвата ими власти обоснованно называли “тюрьмой народов”.\n\nНе учитывалось мнение народов и при создании СССР. Когда образовался Союз ССР, договор был заключён между РСФСР, УССР , БССР и ЗСФСР. Ни в договоре об образовании СССР, ни в Конституциях РСФСР и СССР не упомянуто, от чьего имени РСФСР заключает договор об образовании Союза и уполномочивались ли высшие органы РСФСР народами, в частности, чеченским народом, на его подписание.

Wang分享的在去中心化基础设施、开发者工具、Defi、Gaming、Web3社区工具、以及NFT等板块的创业idea。看完你有什么想法吗？欢迎评论区交流讨论\n\n原文标题：Crypto/Web3 Startup Ideas\n\n作者：Qiao Wang，Alliance DAO创始人\n\n编译：火火\n\nAlliance DAO的前身是Web3孵化器DeFi Alliance（Defi 联盟）。自成立以来共参与过140+加密生态孵化与建设，包括0x、Alpha Finance、dYdX、Kyber、Olympus DAO、Paraswap、Ribbon Finance、Sushiswap、Synthetix和Zerion等明星项目，涉猎内容很广。\n\n2022 年 1 月，DeFi Alliance 创建去中心化组织组织Alliance DAO，并完成 5000 万美元融资，超 300 名贡献者加入 DAO 并参与融资，由此Alliance DAO开始取代DeFi Alliance进入大众视野，如今已是WEB3领域最大的加速DAO。\n\nQiao Wang是Alliance DAO的创始人，以下是他在 AllianceDAO 收集到的一些令人感到兴奋的加密/Web3 启动想法和主题。\n\n## 01\n\n## 去中心化基础设施\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0723/ad970bb59f1e21b942368c6435f98204.jpeg)\n\n### 1.分散堆栈所有层的去中心化\n\n近年来，这个空间似乎不再热衷于关注去中心化，而正是这种趋势让这个空间变得有趣。我们看到诸如“用户不关心去中心化”之类的memes。\n\n但是，权力下放在它发生之前都是纸上谈兵。随着最近集中式加密机构的崩盘，以及全球范围内更广泛的金融和社会审查，去中心化比以往任何时候都更加重要。\n\n应用程序与最集中的层一样分散。所以整个堆栈需要去中心化。\n\n**堆栈的层包括：**\n\n*   DNS（例如，Handshake）\n*   通用计算\n*   数据存储（例如，Filecoin）\n*   数据索引（例如，Graph）\n*   预言机（例如，Chainlink）\n*   桥\n*   节点基础设施\n*   Fiat入口匝道和出口匝道\n*   钱包\n*   ISP（例如，Helium：一种采用物联网电磁波挖矿挖掘数字货币的新方法）\n*   CDN\n\n看起来这些层中的许多层已经拥有一个占主导地位的去中心化参与者。然而，大多数现有玩家充其量只是凑数的。不过这些是 Web3 中一些最具挑战性的工程和计算机科学问题。\n\n### 2.去中心化 Postgres（数据库管理系统）\n\n目前没有办法像在 Web2 中那样轻松地编写一个完备的客户端应用程序，并且让其实现完全去中心化。在 Web2 中，您在 AWS 上启动一个数据库，并让您的客户端应用程序调用该数据库进行读写。但Web3 中没有类似的东西。\n\n你不能只将数据写入以太坊，这对于大多数用户来说太昂贵了。Filecoin 和 Arweave 等存储协议主要用于归档数据，但没有为写入和读取数据提供企业级性能保证。\n\n而一个去中心化的 Postgres 将可以支持大量的新应用程序。\n\n### 3.去中心化 AWS Lambda\n\n一个由活动驱动的去中心化计算网络，它：\n\n*   运行代码以响应前端或智能合约触发的事件\n*   自动管理运行该代码所需的资源\n*   支持读取/写入区块链和存储协议。\n\n4.去中心化跨链Etherscan\n\n作为协议或货币化 API 构建，因此开发人员可以在数据之上构建。比如：\n\n*   查看任何钱包/合约\n*   支持合约验证和合约调用\n*   支持合约和钱包标签\n*   跟踪块的产生和块数据\n\n### 5.分散式 GPU 渲染\n\n需要 GPU 计算能力的人和拥有闲置 GPU 的人之间的市场。潜在应用包括训练 AI 模型、元界渲染和 GPU 挖掘。\n\n### 6.特定的 L2 应用作为服务\n\nAxie、Bored Apes 和 dYdX 等生态已经推出或正在考虑推出自己的应用链。通过这样做，他们牺牲了共享安全性、原子可组合性和工程简单性，以换取吞吐量、主权和价值增值。应用程序链的替代方案可能是特定于应用程序的 L2。\n\napp-L2 即服务产品将使 dapp 开发人员推出自己的 L2 变得非常简单。它将在幕后招募测序人员/验证人员。它甚至可以启动应用于特定程序的索引器、预言机、桥接器、块浏览器等。\n\n### 7.静态 Web2 信息的预言机\n\n目前，Web3 中的预言机主要用于从CEX拉取价格等高频信息。这使得贷款和衍生品等应用成为可能。\n\n这还需要来自以下方面的相对静态信息的预言机：\n\n*   Web2 社交/消息，如 Twitter 和 Discord\n*   Steam 等游戏平台\n*   KYC 提供商\n*   信用局\n*   银行\n\n这些预言机可以实现大量新用例，例如抗女巫攻击。\n\n注：预言机的功能就是将外界信息写入到区块链内，完成区块链与现实世界的数据互通。\n\n### 9.半托管钱包\n\n钱包基础设施仍然是大规模采用路上的最大瓶颈。\n\n按照设计，中心化托管钱包为了安全性牺牲了灵活性。除了兑换和转移之外，不可能使用像托管 Coinbase 钱包这样的东西。无限制地访问 dapp 需要去中心化的自助钱包。\n\n我们希望看到的钱包是“半托管”的：\n\n*   用户保留一份密钥，公司保留另一份密钥。两者都需要通过多方计算 (MPC) 签署兑换。如果只有一方被黑，资金仍然是安全的，因为在任何时候都没有人拥有完整的密钥。\n*   如果用户丢失了他们的密钥，MPC (多方计算平台）还允许通过第三方（例如，AWS KSM）恢复他们的密钥。\n*   理想情况下，钱包提供类似微信的超级应用体验，里面可以直接访问各种应用。这能提升用户体验感。\n*   最后，钱包应具有以下部分或全部属性：\n*   钱包内部进出方便\n*   易于 dapp 开发人员集成\n*   多链支持\n*   批量兑换（签署一次以执行多个链上兑换）\n\n### 10.协议从客户端中分离出来\n\n今天有多个团队正在构建社交协议，例如：\n\n*   地址到地址消息传递协议\n*   社交图谱\n*   身份和凭据\n\n然而，获胜的协议很可能不是由协议的优先生态构建的，而是由非常成功的面向消费者的客户端构建的，这些客户端最终开放了他们的“服务器端”供其他开发人员在其上构建。\n\n毕竟，如果你有一个杀手级的应用程序，更容易吸引开发人员在你的协议之上构建。\n\n（以太坊显然与此相反。开发者并没有等到以太坊基金会建立一个杀手级应用程序之后才对以太坊进行黑客攻击。原因是以太坊是一个高度泛化的低级协议，而社交协议则更加专业化， 层次更高。）\n\n## 02\n\n## 开发者工具\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0723/643870cbf9a4ebd7f7e6e7967b097367.jpeg)\n\n### 1.Web3 Vercel/Firebase\n\n使启动静态前端、部署到 IFPS 以及设置 ENS 域以进行解析，具有类似于将 Web2 站点部署到 Vercel 的 DX。\n\n### 2.Solana 开发工具\n\n使 DX 更接近 EVM DX。想想 Solana 的 HardHat/Foundry。\n\n## 03\n\n## DeFi\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0723/43260469c3ebbb3905f80a777fffb1d9.jpeg)\n\n### 1.市场驱动的借代协议\n\n当今大多数现有贷款协议中的价格并不完全由市场驱动，而是由治理或自由度很少的数学公式驱动。\n\n### 2.桥聚合器\n\n想想 1 英寸的桥梁。构建为可组合的，以便钱包可以使用您的桥聚合器，而不是通过手动去持每个桥。\n\n### 3.市场预测\n\n尤其是体育博彩。Web2 博彩平台也受到以下相同问题的困扰：\n\n*   用户并不真正拥有他们的资产\n*   用户被平台审查\n*   平台为了作弊不顾客户利益\n\n### 4.Delta One 衍生品和期权 DEX\n\n去中心化衍生协议的成交量目前只是中心化兑换的一小部分。\n\n### 5.隐私 DeFi 协议\n\n一个 DeFi 平台，允许用户以将以下部分或全部信息以保密的方式进行兑换：\n\n*   发件人和收件人地址\n*   资产兑换\n*   成交金额\n\n理想情况下，平台范围内的系统性风险指标（例如杠杆）仍然是公开的。\n\n### 6.比特币 DeFi 协议\n\n是一种为比特币（最具流动性的加密资产）提供了更多实用性而非持有储存的产品，通过它可以产生收益、兑换、支付等。即使解决方案必须是半中心化的。\n\n### 7.治理最小化的 DeFi 协议\n\n事实上，今天的大多数治理论坛都是权力下放的剧场。\n\n由于证券法，治理以分散的方式进行。然而，委员会的决定却适得其反。这是大多数 DeFi 协议面临的关键难题。\n\n我们希望看到能够最小化可治理参数数量的 DeFi 协议。在某种程度上，市场驱动的借代协议 就是这样的例子。\n\n### 8.访问 DeFi 的机构级平台\n\n一个供机构访问各种 DeFi 协议并进行兑换、借代等活动的平台。\n\n## 04\n\n## GameFi\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0723/1822789170458272edac729bd0e0f13a.jpeg)\n\n### 1.完全链上游戏\n\n链上游戏是指将整个游戏状态和游戏逻辑（不仅仅是游戏内资产，如货币和 NFT）写入区块链的游戏。\n\n比如井字游戏、回合、3x3 棋盘、玩家和三人序列的概念必须作为规则不可更改地记录在案，还必须记录玩家移动的历史。\n\n另一方面，棋盘和棋子的颜色、棋子的形状（X 和 O 可以变成 Y 和 Z）、动画、声音等都可以保留在客户端。\n\n将所有状态和逻辑放在链上可以解锁各种新颖的行为：\n\n*   基于智能合约的玩家（相对于人类玩家）根据智能且不断改进的规则玩游。\n*   想想游戏和玩家之间的可组合性。最早的实例之一实际上是 DeFi 中的 MEV。MEV 机器人是基于智能合约的玩家，而 MEV 是游戏。请注意，在这种情况下，基于智能合约的机器人玩家不仅相互竞争，而且还与人类玩家竞争。\n*   玩家之间通过智能合约进行无信任协作。\n*   考虑玩家之间的可组合性。以黑暗森林为例，在发布时，它是一款只有非正式联盟的多人游戏。为了一起工作，你需要相信其他玩家不会背叛你。然而，有人建立了一个智能合约来充当竞争者。该合同允许玩家在未经许可的情况下捐赠积分，最终排名足够高以赢得奖金。它保持跟踪，然后当它获胜时，这些玩家能够按比例分享该奖金。\n*   由第三方开发者构建的游戏模组，无需担心被去平台化。\n*   考虑游戏之间的可组合性，再次以黑暗森林为例。有人创造了多人游戏的单人游戏衍生产品。由于以太坊很少使用钻石标准，因此使用了与主合约相同的逻辑。改变的只是地图、用户体验和评分。不是玩家试图在同一地形上同步控制对方，而是每个人都试图解决同一个谜题，但比其他人更快。\n\n### 2.游戏发行商\n\nWeb3 游戏开发者面临着独特的挑战，例如：\n\n*   对已有用户的使用体验极差（例如，安装钱包）\n*   服从规则\n\nWeb3 原生游戏发行商让让开发者发布游戏和让玩家开始玩游戏，就像 Steam 为 Web2 游戏所做的一样容易。\n\n### 3.游戏引擎\n\n虽然目前在该领域构建的大多数游戏引擎都希望将 web3 功能添加到 web2 产品中，但我们实际上对创建原生 web3 游戏工具感到很兴奋。如果我们可以为链上游戏创建交互或物理标准会怎样。想象一下，即使是《龙与地下城》的链上法则，任何人都可以重复使用和重新混合那种。\n\n### 4.游戏作为 Web3-Native 社交网络/消息传递的方式\n\nWeb3 社区痴迷于去中心化的社交/消息传递。然而，第一个真正成功的 Web3 原生社交网络/消息应用程序看起来不会像 Twitter/WhatsApp，因为简单地分散在整个堆栈可能不足以吸引用户切换。\n\n游戏可能是楔子。一款有趣且互动性足以吸引大量用户的 Web3 原生游戏可以将其自身转变为流行的去中心化社交网络/消息传递的应用程序，即，是一个供人们闲逛的地方。\n\n（可以赢得 Web3 社交/消息传递的第二大类应用程序是 DeFi。可以这么说，DeFi 是游戏化金融。）\n\n## 05\n\n## Web3-Native 社区的工具\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0723/643870cbf9a4ebd7f7e6e7967b097367.jpeg)\n\n### 1.Web3-Native 社区的启动板\n\n“Web3-Native 社区”有几个名称，例如 DAO 和 NFT 社区。但基本上，这是一群共享激励措施的人。\n\n无代码启动板将首先让他们启动相关的智能合约和众筹，这些是最直接和可扩展的痛点。一旦获得了一定数量的用户，启动板将能够识别其他用户需求，例如成员参与、访问控制和治理登。\n\n最终，此类产品将在不同类型的社区中分拆。\n\n### 2.后台 back office\n\nWeb3 社区有独特的软件需求：\n\n*   会计\n*   税\n*   工资单\n*   B2B 支付\n*   赏金管理\n\n因为他们的金融兑换往往是链上的。\n\n3.用户拥有的生产力/发布/通信工具\n\n“用户拥有”是指以下两种情况之一或两者兼具：\n\n*   不可审查\n*   隐私保护\n\n任何使用 Notion 等主流工具的个人或组织都知道这对他们来说是一种生存风险。如此多的关键任务信息和工作流程最终由一家科技公司控制，因此容易受到科技公司本身或政府的审查或侵犯隐私权。\n\n第一个进入市场的将是 Web3 原生社区，因为它们恰好是一群关心审查和隐私的人，但当然最终该产品可能对非 Web3 个人和实体有用。\n\n### 3.Web3 社区的“投资银行”\n\n与传统公司类似，DAO 需要股权融资、债务融资、并购、资金管理等方面的咨询。\n\n### 4.DAO 作为风险分担工具\n\n有一些高风险高回报的职业：\n\n*   职业玩家\n*   白帽黑客\n*   Youtube/TikTok 创作者\n*   音乐家\n*   故事作家\n*   药物开发商\n*   不动产突入者/开发商\n\n游戏玩家/黑客/创作者/音乐家/等的 DAO 可能是这些专业人士分担风险同时保持相同预期回报的完美工具。\n\n第一代 DAO 是投资 DAO，这并非巧合。创业和投入是高风险高回报的活动\n\n这些 DAO 将提供三个主要功能：\n\n*   策展：他们需要寻高潜力的成员。\n*   风险分担：他们投入新成员以换取未来的财务收益，而成员可以选择分享自己的优势。\n*   支持：他们相互提供支持，例如营销和分销。\n\n为什么是 DAO 与传统法人实体？从根本上说，DAO 可以减少与传统法律框架相关的摩擦。如果满足以下条件，DAO 可能是比传统法律实体更好的选择\n\n*   成员频繁更换：想象一下所涉及的文书工作量！\n*   成员是全球性的：多个司法管辖区意味着具有更多的法律和银行复杂性。\n*   成员希望保持匿名：KYC/AML 需要建立传统的法人实体。\n\n## 06\n\n## NFT\n\n## ![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0723/2df34e4f06207d097d2de7700cde1b02.jpeg)\n\n### 1.NFT 作为数字原生知识产权\n\n将知识产权视为一种资产类别。为了了解这一资产类别的重要性，在过去 5 年中，无形资产已从标准普尔 500 指数市值的约 1/5 增加到约 4/5。\n\n代表单个 IP 的 NFT 可以帮助释放各种资产的流动性，例如：\n\n*   音乐、视频、写作和艺术\n*   专有技术和科学发现\n*   品牌\n\n然后是建立一个专注于特定类型资产的一级和二级市场。\n\n今天，存在几个这样的 NFT 市场，但使 NFT 真正有趣的不是这些资产的投机性质，而是从这些资产中创造衍生作品的能力，即它们成为生产性资产。\n\n起初，我们可以利用传统的法律制度将知识产权附加到特定的 NFT，比如 IP 的标记化。\n\n然而，最终，NFT 可能会成为数字原生 IP。\n\n我们已经在许多流行的PFP生态中看到，“右键单击保存”不仅不会破坏原始作品的价值，而且实际上是对其进行免费营销。\n\n有了这一点社会共识，加上NFT欺诈检测产品 的帮助，以及可编程性（例如，智能合约中的程序版税)，我们可以看到原始作品自然而然地产生了价值。\n\n### 2.应用内 NFT 市场\n\n游戏开发者更喜欢将应用内市场用于他们的 NFT，因为两个原因：\n\n*   必须从游戏应用程序转移到外部市场最终会给用户带来很多不好的体验。\n*   他们希望将成交费用返还给他们自己或他们的社区，而不是第三方 NFT 市场。\n\n这个想法是为游戏开发者构建一个 API/协议，以启动应用内 NFT 市场。这个想法可以扩展到其他消费产品，如音乐/视频/品牌等NFT 平台。Token作为协调人类活动的工具在协调大规模人类活动方面，Token可能比政府和大公司等有能力的中心化实体更有效。\n\n### 3.贡献数据以赚钱\n\n为了让“x-to-earn”可持续工作，赚取Token的参与者必须为网络的其他部分提供有价值的东西。数据贡献是“x”的明显候选。\n\n今天，阻碍人类在各个领域取得有意义进展的不是我们无法处理、理解和从数据中获取价值，而是我们缺乏数据。\n\nToken可用于激励大量人员引导有价值的数据集，例如：\n\n*   训练自动驾驶模型所需的视觉数据\n*   研究和药物发现所需的健康数据\n*   我们星球的 3D 渲染：想想去中心化的谷歌地球\n*   互联网消费者行为：想想分散的尼尔森，这是一项每年 3B 美元的业务\n*   实时犯罪数据Token持有者最终获得了他们帮助创建的数据集产生的一些价值\n\n### 4.解决公地悲剧\n\n我们不知道这究竟会是什么样子，但我们怀疑有可能使用Token经济学来调整个人和公地之间的激励措施，从而在我们与周围环境互动的方式上引发大规模的行为变化。\n\n### 5.主要消费品的拆分\n\n可以拆分的 Web3 产品类别包括但不限于：\n\n*   NFT 市场\n*   钱包\n*   DeFi 聚合器/仪表板，它们可以不捆绑\n*   地理区域\n*   用户细分（例如，业余爱好者与专业人士）\n*   垂直领域（例如，游戏、艺术、音乐等）\n*   公链\n*   设备（例如，台式机与移动设备）\n\n以 NFT 市场为例。每一个都可能有一个 Opensea，从根本上说，这些不同细分市场的消费者有不同的需求和偏好。因此，一个市场根本不可能为所有市场提供服务。\n\n### 6.AI 与 Web3 的交集\n\n人工智能自然与 Web3 相交，因为后者的核心是一个高价值数据的开放分类帐。人工智能对链上数据的具体应用包括但不限于：\n\n*   信用评分\n*   NFT抄袭检测\n*   游戏中的作弊检测和追溯空投\n*   链上游戏中的人工智能\n*   配置者和兑换者的分析\n*   基于钱包活动的个性化推荐（想想 Web3 原生广告）\n*   贡献数据赚钱\n\n### 7.健康科学与 Web3 的交集\n\n两个问题困扰着健康科学：\n\n*   缺乏资金\n*   缺乏数据（可以说还是由于缺乏资金）\n\n这可以通过以下加密科学，即被许多人称为 DeSci的方式来缓解：\n\n*   DAOs 作为风险分担工具\n*   贡献数据赚钱\n\n## 07\n\n## 匿名经济与 Web3\n\n匿名经济是一种你的同事、合作伙伴、成交对手和竞争对手不知道你的名字、位置、性别、种族、国籍、身高和口音的经济。\n\n加密是匿名经济的关键推动力之一。使用公钥加密，用户能够将他们的财务和社交活动与他们的真实姓名分开。\n\n## 08\n\n## 小结\n\n以上就是Alliance DAO创始人Qiao

{"id": "ZyhLjEf7KD1AWC1gBq1fuQsOBzvgamEk1FK7W6SOKOk", "title": "Ликвидный стейкинг в Cosmos", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-fUi4MJ8pke4fkk8TKUGj.png?height=470&width=699)\n\nОдним из самых популярных финансовых видов деятельности в DeFi, несомненно, является стейкинг. С точки зрения инвестора, стейкинг — это возможность разместить свои средства, чтобы получить фиксированный доход с течением времени.\n\nХотя стейкинг, безусловно, доказал свою жизнеспособность как средство получения вознаграждения для участников экосистемы PoS, он связан с определенными ограничениями. В частности, стейкхолдеры обязаны фиксировать свои активы в протоколах PoS, что ограничивает их возможности заработка из-за неликвидности, поэтому они вынуждены выбирать между стейкингом и возможностями получения доходности в DeFi.\n\nБольшее количество токенов PoS (например, ATOM), используемых для деятельности DeFi вместо отправки в стейкинг, означает меньшее количество токенов, обеспечивающих безопасность цепи, которая является важным компонентом, позволяющим сетям PoS процветать.\n\nТеперь появилась новая и многообещающая альтернатива традиционному крипто-стейкингу в том виде, в котором мы его знаем - ликвидный стейкинг. Этот новый механизм позволяет пользователям токенизировать свои позиции в стейкинге, обеспечивая их дополнительными ликвидными активами, которые затем можно использовать в других продуктах и приложениях DeFi. Это означает, что благодаря ликвидному стейкингу стейкеры теперь могут использовать другие возможности для получения дополнительной прибыли, сохраняя при этом основные позиции своих стейкинг-активов.\n\nЛиквидный стейкинг — выпуск «производного» токена под залог криптовалюты, заблокированной в стейкинге. Токен можно использовать для операций в DeFi-приложениях.\n\nВ конце 2021 года объем TVL по протоколам ликвидного стейкинга составлял примерно 10,5 млрд долларов. Сегодня эта цифра составляет более $19 млрд и быстро растет, поскольку инновации продолжают распространяться в различных экосистемах.\n\nНиже мы еще рассмотрим новаторов, привнесших ликвидный стейкинг в экосистему Cosmos.\n\n**Почему Cosmos созрел для ликвидного стейкинга.**\n\nЗа последний год экосистема Cosmos совершила стремительный взлет в сфере DeFi, развиваясь экспоненциальными темпами и собрав более 33 миллиардов долларов в TVL (Total Value Locked) в таких ведущих сетях, как Terra (да, на тот момент Terra была жива), Osmosis, Cronos и других. В результате в Cosmos устремилось большое количество новых пользователей, желающих использовать обширный набор протоколов и dApps.\n\nЭто открывает новые возможности для участников экосистемы, однако стейкеры (основные участники PoS-сетей) не могут воспользоваться преимуществами DeFi из-за блокировки своих активов.\n\nВ настоящее время в Cosmos размещено около 186 миллионов ATOM (более 63% всех токенов, находящихся в обращении). Поскольку количество стейкеров в Cosmos продолжает расти вместе с ростом экосистемы DeFi, спрос на дополнительную доходность от стейковых активов также увеличивается.\n\nВ настоящее время решения для ликвидного стейкинга в Cosmos начинают набирать обороты и еще больше стимулировать принятие DeFi - причем быстро. Многие амбициозные проекты создают и внедряют механизмы, обеспечивающие повышенную полезность стабфондовых активов.\n\nПочему же идея ликвидного стейкинга так хорошо подходит именно для Cosmos? Cosmos обладает надежной инфраструктурой, необходимой для поддержки совершенно новой экономики токенизированных активов - она позволяет пользователям получать выгоду от чрезвычайно низких комиссий, молниеносной скорости транзакций, экспоненциальной масштабируемости, первоклассной безопасности и многого другого.\n\nБолее того, обширная сеть чейнов с поддержкой IBC обеспечивает бесшовную и оптимальную совместимость между поддерживаемыми цифровыми активами, максимально расширяя их применение и возможности для всех участников. Ликвидный стейкинг представляет собой совершенно новый класс активов, который значительно расширяет охват этих перспектив, создавая огромную ценность на всеобъемлющей основе.\n\n**Поставщики ликвидного стейкинга в Cosmos.**\n\nВ рамках Cosmos несколько проектов являются лидерами, когда речь заходит о внедрении решений для ликвидного стейкинга. Некоторые текущие решения предназначены для стейкеров ATOM и выпускают ликвидные активы на Ethereum, некоторые создают собственные реализации в экосистеме Cosmos, а некоторые используют межсетевой подход.\n\nЧасть решений для ликвидного стейкинга, например уже работают и набирают обороты, в то время как другая часть находится в стадии разработки и ожидает запуска во втором полугодии 2022 года.\n\n**Crescent**\n\nДля того чтобы пользователи могли пользоваться многими возможностями (обмен/передача/депозит) со своими активами во время размещения, Crescent Network вводит концепцию ликвидного размещения. Как только пользователь стейкает CRE через модуль ликвидного стейкинга, поставленный CRE блокируется, а вместо нее пользователь получает bCRE (привязанный к стоимости основного токена).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OH4GbkAOrFDENkZfN3qEA.png?height=420&width=741)\n\nКогда делегаты захотят разблокировать bCRE, модуль сожжет bCRE и вернет им CRE, которые будут иметь большее количество CRE благодаря вознаграждениям за ликвидный стейкинг в период делегирования.\n\nЛиквидный стейкинг решает проблему бездействующих активов, расширяя возможности вторичных инвестиций, при этом предоставляя пользователю те же полномочия по голосованию и делегированию. Это минимизирует альтернативные издержки традиционного стейкинга, что сводит на нет неоправданно высокую ставку вознаграждения за стейкинг для более эффективного использования инфляции CRE для всей экосистемы:\n\nЛиквидный стейкинг приводит к диверсифицированному делегированию полномочий валидаторам с заранее определенными весами полномочий.\nГруппа валидаторов ликвидного стейкинга управляется в рамках процесса управления сообществом.\n**Kava**\n\nЛиквидный стейкинг был реализован в сети Kava Network с обновлением Kava 10, которое состоялось 25 мая 2022, что позволило стейкерам KAVA получить доступ и использовать свои средства токенизированным способом во время стейкинга для повышения безопасности сети и получения вознаграждения.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OOZRa9DWExrL3hDGa0iV0.png?height=364&width=634)\n\n**Sienna Network**\n\nSienna - это сквозной децентрализованный финансовый протокол, основанный на [Secret Network](https://scrt.network/), который позволяет использовать финансовые инструменты, такие как торговля и кредитование, с полной конфиденциальностью для нескольких блокчейн-экосистем.\n\nКонфиденциальность, как для отдельных лиц, так и для организаций, требуется законом и должна всегда рассматриваться как одно из основных прав человека. Сиенна выполняет миссию по защите ваших личных данных.\n\nВ недавней [новости](https://medium.com/sienna-network/sescrt-siennalend-siennaswap-lp-rewards-boosted-5386279286ac) Sienna заявила об увеличении вознаграждения по программе seSCRT SiennaLend+SiennaSwap LP.\n\nЛиквидный стейкинг StakeEasy для стейкинга SCRT - seSCRT (StakeEasy SCRT) - теперь дополнен вознаграждениями на SiennaSwap и SiennaLend.\n\nВознаграждения для поставщиков ликвидности на рынке seSCRT: 50 SIENNA/день.\n\nВ официальном [блоге Persistence](https://blog.persistence.one/2022/03/29/the-liquid-staking-landscape-of-cosmos-a-birds-eye-view/) реализация ликвидного стейкинга представлена следующим слайдом. Посмотрим, что с этими проектами происходит сегодня.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zw7zPJm4_Du9xKESxFQ2S.png?height=372&width=697)\n\n**Lido Finance**\n\nLido Finance - это популярный протокол ликвидного стейкинга, работающий на Ethereum, Solana, Kusama и Polygon.\n\nПротокол Lido Cosmos Liquid Staking позволяет пользователям получать вознаграждение за стейкинг Atom без блокировки Atom или поддержания инфраструктуры стейкинга.\n\nПользователи могут вносить Atom в смарт-контракты Lido и получать взамен токены stAtom. Затем смарт-контракт выставляет токены на торги с операторами узлов, выбранных DAO.\n\nВ отличие от Atom, токен stAtom свободен от ограничений, связанных с недостатком ликвидности, и может быть получен в любое время.\n\n**StaFi**\n\nStaFi поддерживает ликвидный стейкинг для широкого спектра PoS-активов. Делая ставку на свои активы в StaFi, пользователи получают rTokens, которые можно обменивать и торговать, постоянно получая вознаграждение за тейкинг. Это одна из немногих платформ, которая в настоящее время поддерживает ликвидный стейкинг для ATOM, хотя ее текущий TVL в ATOM относительно невелик (около $380 000 на момент написания статьи).\n\n**Osmosis (суперфлюидный стейкинг)**\n\nOsmosis быстро вырос и стал ведущим DEX в экосистеме Cosmos. В марте 2022 года Osmosis запустил механизм суперфлюидный стейкинг, который сейчас работает для пулов ATOM/OSMO (UST/OSMO и LUNA/OSMO скончались одновременно). Суперфлюидный стейкинг позволяет поставщикам ликвидности получать дополнительную прибыль, генерируемую за счет вознаграждения за стейкинг - 50% от позиции пользователя OSMO по предоставленной ликвидности (25% от общей позиции пользователя в пуле) ставится при выборе суперфлюидного стейкинга.\n\nСуперфлюидный стейкинг предоставляет поставщикам ликвидности OSMO беспроблемный механизм получения дополнительной прибыли, хотя и имеет определенные ограничения по сравнению с решениями ликвидного стейкинга. При использовании суперфлюидного стейкинга дополнительную доходность приносит только 25% позиции пользователя в пуле (в настоящее время это около 269 миллионов долларов США от общего объема OSMO в поддерживаемых пулах), а возможности получения доходности DeFi ограничены только Osmosis. Кроме того, отсутствует возможность получения мгновенной ликвидности по позиции пользователя в стейке из-за требования о 14-дневном обеспечении ликвидности. По своей сути суперфлюидный стейкинг можно назвать обратным по отношению к ликвидному стейкингу, где меняется последовательность предоставления активов в стейкинг и пул ликвидности. Подробнее о суперфлюидном стейкинге вы можете узнать в нашей [статье про Osmosis](https://teletype.in/@creeptahfarm/cosmos_guide).\n\n**Cosmos Hub**\n\nCosmos Hub был первой сетью, запущенной в рамках экосистемы Cosmos, и находится в самом центре широкой сети. Реализация ликвидного стейкинга для Cosmos Hub в настоящее время находится в процессе разработки, а Заки Маниан и рабочая группа Iqlusion Liquid Staking Working Group работают над воплощением этой идеи в жизнь.\n\nКлючевое преимущество ликвидного стейкинга на Cosmos Hub, как и других решений ATOM для ликвидного стейкинга, заключается в том, что держатели токенов ATOM смогут одновременно обеспечивать безопасность базовой сети и использовать другие возможности DeFi, повышая экономическую активность для собственного токена.\n\nЛиквидный стейкинг Cosmos Hub будет запущен вместе с обновлением Rho, которое ожидалось во втором квартале 2022 года, но ,видимо, будет перенесено.\n\n**Quicksilver Protocol**\n\nQuicksilver Protocol - это протокол ликвидного стейкинга, создаваемый на базе Cosmos, который работает как посредник между пользователями и уже существующими протоколами стейкинга. Пользователи могут одновременно стейкать у нескольких провайдеров, а не у одного, что дает пользователям больше автономии.\n\nПроект недавно завершил первоначальные тестовые сети и развернул стимулирующую тестовую сеть во втором квартале 2022 года, а запуск запланирован на третий квартал 2022 года. Хотя Quicksilver все еще находится на очень ранних стадиях с точки зрения достижения полностью рабочего продукта, он представляет собой интересный подход к ликвидному майнингу.\n\n**pSTAKE**\n\npSTAKE - это протокол ликвидного стейкинга от Persistence, позволяющий разблокировать ликвидность для активов, которые стейкаются. Владельцы ATOM и XPRT (скоро появятся и другие PoS-активы в Cosmos и далее) могут стейкать нативные PoS-активы и напрямую майнить 1:1 stkASSET . Затем stkASSET можно использовать для участия в DeFi деятельности в сети Ethereum (и скоро в экосистеме Cosmos) для получения дополнительной прибыли.\n\npSTAKE - один из немногих протоколов ликвидного стейкинга с поддержкой ATOM и самый значительный по объему ATOM TVL, который сейчас составляет 31 миллион долларов. Хотя в настоящее время stkASSET выпускаются на Ethereum, pSTAKE расширит свой охват на экосистему Cosmos как заявлялось во втором квартале 2022 года (чего, судя по всему, пока не произошло), запустив цепочку Persistence Core-1, поддерживаемую IBC. Это означает, что stkASSETs смогут проходить через экосистему Cosmos DeFi.\n\npSTAKE планировался в дальнейшую интеграцию DeFi для своих stkASSET, включая включение bATOM (обернутый stkATOM на Terra) в качестве залога на протоколе Anchor. bATOM на Anchor должен был обеспечить первый случай использования DeFi заимствования для стейкеров ATOM, открывая новые возможности для сообщества Cosmos. Занимать естественно планировали UST. На данный момент, изучив открытую документацию Persistence получить ответ, что же заменит Терру пока не удалось (будем следить и дополнять статью). Поддержка ликвидного стейкинга для других популярных активов, таких как ETH, SOL и других активов IBC, появится на pSTAKE, видимо, уже после 2го полугодия 2022. Такую схему запуска ликвидного стейкинга на 2022 год предоставляет нам официальный блог Persistence:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4tty8-Y5qxw5ZTYJ6K-hi.png?height=369&width=697)\n\n**Ликвидная революция приходит в Cosmos**\n\nВ целом, ликвидный стейкинг окажет глубокое влияние на сети, стейкеров и протоколы DeFi в экосистеме Cosmos. В первую очередь, он откроет дверь для большей распределенной ликвидности и полезности токенов во всех взаимосвязанных сетях, повышая активность и возможности доходности по всем направлениям.\n\nВ конечном итоге это приведет к увеличению TVL и активности во всех сетях, что позволит взаимосвязанным сетям (и их участникам) множиться и процветать.\n\nМногие из вышеупомянутых проектов все еще находятся на начальной и средней стадиях разработки этих решений для ликвидного стейкинга, но уже успешно продвигаются вперед. Поскольку технология продолжает расцветать, экосистема Cosmos готова оставить прочный широкий след в индустрии благодаря этим решениям и инновациям.\n\nПрошел Cosmos [PROPOSAL #72](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/72), о введении ликвидного стейкинга в DeFi в Cosmos Hub с помощью Interchain Security. Еще несколько проектов на космосе выходят с подобными продуктами.

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tbytoB2JihYhH8a0twqJH.jpg?height=832&width=1280)\n\n\\*\\*เทคโนโลยี blockchain ในปัจจุบันนั้นถือว่ามีการเติบโตขึ้นอย่างรวดเร็ว ไม่ว่าจะเป็นการเกิดขึ้นของเชนต่างๆมากมายหรือนวัตกรรมล้ำยุคที่ถูกสร้างขึ้นอยู่ทั่วทุกมุมโลก โดยเป้าหมายปลายทางนั้นล้วนแล้วแต่เป็นเพื่อให้มนุษย์สามารถใช้ประโยชน์จากเทคโนโลยี blockchain ให้ได้มากที่สุด ทั้งการเข้ามาแทนที่ระบบเดิมที่ด้อยประสิทธิภาพ หรือเพื่อแก้ไขปัญหาที่ไม่สามารถแก้ได้ด้วยเทคโนโลยีอื่นๆ\n\\*\\*\n\nแน่นอนว่าการเกิดขึ้นของ Ethereum และ smart contract นั้นได้นำเอาแนวคิดและความเป็นไปได้มากมายมาสู่โลกของเรา ไม่ว่าจะเป็นการถือกำเนิดขึ้นของ DeFi (Decentralized Finance) หรือ dApps (Decentralized Applications) หรือ NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) และอื่นๆอีกมากมาย\n\nเทคโนโลยีเหล่านี้ล้วนแล้วแต่น่าทึ่งและชวนให้ตื่นตาตื่นใจเป็นอย่างมาก ทั้งยังมีเรื่องของความโปร่งใสของระบบที่ทำให้เราสามารถตรวจสอบการทำธุรกรรมของคนอื่นๆได้อย่างง่ายดายอีกด้วย ซึ่งสิ่งเหล่านี้ก็ได้ดึงดูดให้มีผู้เล่นหน้าใหม่เข้ามาใช้งานอย่างต่อเนื่อง จนกระทั่งถึงจุดที่ระบบเดิมเริ่มไม่สามารถรองรับได้ไหวและทำเกิดปัญหาต่างๆตามมา ไม่ว่าจะเป็นความเร็วในการทำธุรกรรมที่ช้าลง หรือค่าธรรมเนียมที่แพงขึ้น\n\nนักพัฒนาและนักวิทยาศาสตร์หลายคนแก้ปัญหานี้ด้วยการสร้างเชนใหม่ขึ้นมาบ้าง บ้างก็ใช้ระบบ consensus แบบใหม่ บ้างก็มีการนำเอาเทคโนโลยีอื่นๆมาประยุกต์ใช้ ซึ่งหนึ่งในวิธีที่กำลังเป็นที่นิยมในปัจจุบันก็คือ ZK-rollups\n\n## ZK-rollups คืออะไร ?\n\n> **ZK-rollups หรือ Zero-Knowledge rollups นั้นเป็นหนึ่งในวิธีแก้ปัญหาที่มักจะถูกนำมาใช้โดยเชนที่เป็น layer 2 ซึ่งหลักการของมันคือการรวบรวมหลายๆธุรกรรมเอาไว้เป็นธุรกรรมเดียว และสร้าง zero-knowledge proof ไว้ใช้สำหรับการตรวจสอบและยืนยันความถูกต้องของธุรกรรมเหล่านั้น ซึ่งการใช้ข้อมูลเพียงแค่บางส่วนจากทั้งหมดในการตรวจสอบความถูกต้องนั้นได้ทำให้ขนาดของข้อมูลเล็กลง การคำนวนและความยุ่งยากในการตรวจสอบก็ลดลง ส่งผลให้ความเร็วในการทำธุรกรรมนั้นเร็วขึ้นเป็นอย่างมาก อีกทั้งค่าธรรมเนียมเองก็ลดลงอย่างเห็นได้ชัด**\n\nแต่ถึงแม้จะมีข้อดีต่างๆมากมาย วิธีนี้ในปัจจุบันเองก็ยังมีปัญหาอยู่หนึ่งอย่างนั่นก็คือเรื่องของ data availability เพราะในการสร้างธุรกรรมใหม่ๆนั้นจำเป็นต้องใช้ข้อมูลเดิมที่ถูกต้องด้วย ซึ่งแม้ว่า zero-knowledge proof นั้นจะสามารถยืนยันความถูกต้องของธุรกรรมที่เกิดขึ้นโดยไม่จำเป็นต้องเปิดเผยข้อมูลทั้งหมดได้ แต่มันก็ไม่สามารถรับประกันความถูกต้องของข้อมูลที่จะถูกนำไปใช้สร้างธุรกรรมอื่นๆในอนาคตได้ ซึ่งแก้ปัญหาในปัจจุบันนั้นมีทั้งการแนบข้อมูลธุรกรรมจริงๆไปด้วยพร้อมกัน หรือการให้บุคคลที่สามเป็นผู้ยืนยันความถูกต้องของข้อมูล แต่วิธีเหล่านี้ก็มีข้อเสียบางอย่างที่ต้องแลกมา ไม่ว่าจะเป็นการทำให้เกิดข้อจำกัดเรื่องขนาดของข้อมูลและประสิทธิภาพในการใช้งาน หรือการสูญเสียความเป็น decentralized ไป\n\nนอกจากนี้ แม้ว่าความโปร่งใสเองจะเป็นข้อดีแต่มันก็เป็นข้อเสียด้วยเช่นกัน เพราะว่าการที่ใครก็สามารถเห็นธุรกรรมของเราได้นั้นมันทำให้ไม่สามารถนำไปใช้งานได้ในหลายกรณี ลองคิดดูว่าหากบริษัทสักแห่งต้องการใช้ cryptocurrency ในการชำระค่าสินค้า คู่แข่งของบริษัทแห่งนี้ก็จะสามารถเข้ามาดูได้ว่าต้นทุนของบริษัทนี้คือเท่าไหร่ และคู่ค้าคือใคร หรือแม้แต่การซื้อขายหรือเก็งกำไรต่างๆก็จะไม่เป็นความลับและข้อมูลเหล่านี้อาจจะถูกใช้ในการโจมตีหรือให้ผู้ไม่ประสงค์ดีนำไปหาผลประโยชน์ได้\n\nตัวอย่างข้างต้นนั้นเป็นเพียงบางส่วนของข้อจำกัดที่ทำให้การนำเอา cryptocurrency หรือ blockchain มาใช้งานจริงนั้นไม่สามารถทำได้อย่างที่ควรจะเป็น ซึ่งเรื่องนี้เองก็เป็นหนึ่งในหัวข้อสำคัญที่หลายคนกำลังพยายามคิดหาวิธีการแก้ปัญหาในปัจจุบัน เช่น การทำให้ธุรกรรมต่างๆเป็นธุรกรรมแบบส่วนตัว (private) ที่ทำให้คนอื่นไม่สามารถมาดูข้อมูลรายละเอียดของธุรกรรมที่เกิดขึ้นได้\n\nแต่วิธีเหล่านี้เองก็ยังไม่สามารถตอบโจทย์ความต้องการได้อย่างแท้จริง เพราะด้วยการที่เราไม่สามารถตรวจสอบธุรกรรมเหล่านั้นได้ก็ทำให้มันเป็นที่กังขาในเรื่องของความโปร่งใส เราไม่สามารถตรวจสอบได้ว่ามันถูกนำไปใช้งานอย่างถูกต้องหรือไม่ ทำให้มันเป็นเรื่องยากที่จะหน่วยงานต่างๆจะให้การยอมรับและนำไปใช้งาน\n\n> ## และด้วยปัญหาเหล่านี้เองทำให้โปรเจคขนาดใหญ่อย่าง Espresso ถือกำเนิดขึ้น\n\n**Espresso เป็นโปรเจค layer 1 blockchain ที่ถูกสร้างขึ้นโดยมีการผนวกรวม ZK-Rollup เอาไว้ตั้งแต่ขั้นตอนของการออกแบบ ทำให้สามารถทำธุรกรรมได้อย่างรวดเร็วและมีค่าธรรมเนียมที่ถูก อีกทั้งการผนวกรวมที่ว่านี้นั้นคือการผนวกเข้าไปเป็นส่วนหนึ่งของ consensus ทำให้ ZK-Rollup นั้นสามารถทำงานร่วมกับ Espresso ได้อย่างสมบูรณ์และเป็นธรรมชาติ หรืออีกนัยหนึ่งก็สามารถนับได้ว่ามันเป็น Decentralized ZK-Rollups ทำให้สามารถใช้งาน ZK-Rollups ได้โดยที่ไม่ต้องเจอกับข้อเสียเหมือนดังวิธีอื่นๆในปัจจุบัน**\n\nนอกจากนี้ทาง Espresso ยังได้พัฒนา Configurable Asset Privacy (CAP) protocol ขึ้นมาด้วย โดยมีความสามารถในการเพิ่ม custom privacy ให้แก่ digital assets ต่างๆ โดย application ตัวแรกของ CAP ก็คือ CAPE (Configurable Asset Privacy for Ethereum) ซึ่งเป็น smart contract application ที่สามารถทำงานได้บนทุก blockchain ที่เป็น EVM และแน่นอนว่าต้องรวมถึงตัว Espresso เองด้วย\n\nCAPE นั้นทำให้ผู้ใช้สามารถสร้างสินทรัพย์ขึ้นมาใหม่โดยที่ไม่ต้องอิงกับสินทรัพย์อื่นๆที่มีอยู่เดิมก็ได้ (domestic CAPE assets) หรือจะสร้างโดยการอิงกับสินทรัพย์ที่มีอยู่แล้ว (ERC-20s และ ERC-721s) ก็ทำได้เช่นกัน (wrapping) โดยในขั้นตอนการสร้างนั้นผู้สร้างจะกำหนดค่า viewing policies ของสินทรัพย์ได้ โดยสามารถกำหนดได้ว่าต้องการให้กลุ่มคนที่กำหนดสามารถอ่านและตรวจสอบข้อมูลอะไรได้บ้าง เช่น\n\n* ที่อยู่ของผู้ส่งและผู้รับ\n* จำนวนสินทรัพย์ที่ทำการส่ง ได้รับ หรือถือครอง\n* ประเภทของสินทรัพย์ที่ทำการส่ง ได้รับ หรือถือครอง\n\nและนอกจากนี้ยังสามารถกำหนดได้ว่าต้องการให้ใครบ้างที่สามารถระงับการทำธุรกรรมได้ผ่านทาง freezing policies\n\nความสามารถนี้ทำให้ CAPE สามารถตอบโจทย์ได้ทั้งผู้ใช้งานที่ต้องการความเป็นส่วนตัวในการทำธุรกรรม และยังตอบโจทย์ของผู้ออกสินทรัพย์ที่ต้องการความสามารถในการตรวจสอบข้อมูลของธุรกรรมต่างๆ อีกทั้งยังมีความสามารถในการระงับได้อีกด้วย ซึ่งทำให้สามารถป้องกันการฟอกเงิน การโจรกรรม รวมถึงปัญหาต่างๆอีกมากมาย\n\nหรือก็คือด้วยการมาถึงของ CAPE จะทำให้สินทรัพย์ที่เป็น ERC-20 และ ERC-721 ที่มีอยู่เดิมนั้นสามารถเพิ่มคุณสมบัติเรื่องความเป็นส่วนตัวในการทำธุรกรรมได้ทันทีผ่านการ wrapping และเมื่อไม่ต้องการความสามารถของ CAPE แล้วก็สามารถ unwrapped กลับมาเป็น asset เดิมเมื่อใดก็ได้ และนอกจากนี้อันที่จริงแล้ว CAPE ยังรองรับไปถึง credential Issuer ต่างๆอีกด้วย ซึ่งนี่จะทำให้ผู้ใช้สามารถใช้ CAPE ได้ในขอบเขตที่กว้างขึ้นเป็นอย่างมาก (เช่น การใช้งานสำหรับ Permissioned DeFi)\n\nลักษณะการทำงานของ CAPE นั้นจะคล้ายกับ UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model ที่มีการใช้ outputs เดิม (หรือ records) เพื่อสร้าง outputs ใหม่ออกมา (UTxO) โดยผู้ใช้จะเป็นเจ้าของ records เหล่านี้ ในแต่ละ record จะมีข้อมูลเกี่ยวกับประเภทของสินทรัพย์ จำนวน และที่อยู่ของเจ้าของ โดย CAPE จะสร้าง commitments ที่สัมพันธ์กับ record เหล่านี้ขึ้นมา ซึ่ง commitments นั้นจะมีลักษณะเป็นข้อมูลขนาดเล็กและไม่สื่อถึงตัว record ที่เกี่ยวข้อง และจะถูกบันทึกเอาไว้ใน Records Merkel Tree ของ CAPE\n\nส่วน CAPE Wallet นั้นจะทำหน้าที่ในการสร้าง transaction ก่อนที่จะส่งต่อให้กับ Relayer เป็นผู้นำไปส่งให้กับ CAPE Smart Contract เพื่อยืนยันความถูกต้องของข้อมูลและบันทึกลงบน Ethereum ซึ่งการที่ Relayer เป็นผู้จ่ายค่าธรรมเนียมและเรียกใช้ CAPE Smart Contract นี้ทำให้คนอื่นไม่สามารถรู้ถึงตัวผู้ทำธุรกรรมได้ และนอกจากนี้ CAPE Wallet ยังทำหน้าที่ในการจัดเก็บข้อมูลที่เกี่ยวกับสินทรัพย์ของผู้ใช้ไว้อีกด้วย ทำให้ผู้ใช้สามารถรับรู้เมื่อมีการได้รับสินทรัพย์ใหม่เข้ามา\n\nในขั้นตอนการสร้างธุรกรรมนั้น ผู้ทำธุรกรรมจะต้องใช้ private key ของตัวเองในการ consume records ที่ยังไม่ถูกใช้งานของตัวเองเพื่อสร้าง records ใหม่ออกมา ซึ่งแต่ละธุรกรรมจะประกอบไปด้วย record commitments, list of nullifiers (ใช้เพื่อระบุ records ที่ถูกใช้โดยที่ไม่เปิดเผยข้อมูลของ records นั้นๆ), zero-knowledge proof เพื่อใช้ยืนยันความถูกต้องของการคำนวนในธุรกรรม, และ owner memos ที่จะบันทึกข้อมูลบางส่วนของธุรกรรม เช่น ประเภทและจำนวนของสินทรัพย์ ซึ่ง owner memo นี้จะถูกเข้ารหัสด้วย encrypted public key (ได้มาจาก CAPE Address Book ที่ทำหน้าที่ในการ map address เป็น encrypted public key) ของเจ้าของใหม่ของ record นั้นๆ ทำให้เจ้าของ record สามารถ decrypt เพื่ออ่านข้อมูลใหม่ที่ได้รับมาได้\n\nในส่วนของ owner memos นั้น นอกจากจะสามารถอ่านได้โดยตัวเจ้าของเองแล้ว ผู้ที่ถือครอง viewing key ก็สามารถอ่านได้เช่นกัน ซึ่งทำให้เขาสามารถตรวจสอบการใช้งานของธุรกรรมต่างๆได้ (เท่าที่ asset viewing policies กำหนด ซึ่งอาจจะเห็นทั้งหมด เห็นเพียงบางส่วน หรือไม่เห็นเลย)\n\nCAPE เป็นเพียง application ตัวแรกของ Espresso เท่านั้น แต่มันก็สามารถทำให้สินทรัพย์เดิมที่มีอยู่ทั้งหมดสามารถมีความเป็นส่วนตัวในการทำธุรกรรมได้ ผู้ใช้งานทั่วไปสามารถทำธุรกรรมได้โดยที่ไม่ต้องกังวลเรื่องความเป็นส่วนตัว ผู้ออกสินทรัพย์เองก็สามารถตรวจสอบความโปร่งใสของธุรกรรมและระงับธุรกรรมที่ไม่เหมาะสมได้ และแน่นอนว่าเรื่องนี้จะสามารถทำให้ขอบเขตการใช้งาน blockchain ขยายไปได้อีกมากเพราะข้อจำกัดที่สำคัญจะถูกทำลายลงไป\n\nนี่อาจจะเป็นก้าวสำคัญที่ทำให้ blockchain ถูกยอมรับและใช้งานมากขึ้น ไม่แน่ว่าในอนาคตเราอาจจะได้เห็นผลิตภัณฑ์ใหม่ๆเกิดขึ้นมาอีกมากมายและอาจจะเป็นส่วนสำคัญในการผลักดันให้มีการประยุกต์ใช้ blockchain ในรูปแบบอื่นๆที่ไม่เคยมีมาก่อนก็เป็นได้ นี่เป็นเพียงแค่จุดเริ่มต้นเท่านั้น และพวกเราก็ล้วนแล้วแต่เป็นผู้ที่ได้มีส่วนร่วมในจุดเริ่มต้นนี้\n\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n> ***มีกิจกรรมสุดพิเศษที่ชื่อว่า Knowledge

{"id": "P5tBSx-NO7mt1TiG7EPiBWJ-SQj2ovjg_F65AhWItG4", "title": "Espresso-sys : Customize the privacy of your Ethereum assets and EVM", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7K-eA2YbA3GDT_8T4LEo.jpg?height=832&width=1280)\n\nBlockchain technology is rapidly evolving today. Whether it is the emergence of new chains or the cutting-edge innovations being developed around the world, the ultimate goal is for humans to be able to make the most of blockchain technology. Either to replace an inefficient old system or to solve problems that cannot be solved by currently available technologies.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum and smart contracts has given rise to so many new ideas and possibilities in our world. Whether it's the introduction of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), dApps (Decentralized Applications), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and other technologies. All of these technologies are incredible.\n\nThere is also the system's transparency, which allows us to see other people's transactions. All of this has enticed new players to use it incessantly, to the point where the system is becoming unable to support it and causing a variety of issues, such as slow transaction speeds or higher transaction fees.\n\nMany developers and scientists have solved this problem by developing new chains. Some use new consensus systems, while others try to use alternative solutions, one of which is ZK-rollup.\n\n## What is ZK- Rollups ?\n\nZK-rollups, or Zero-Knowledge rollups, are commonly implemented as layer 2 chains. The idea is to combine multiple transactions into a single transaction and then generate a zero-knowledge proof to validate the validity of those transactions. When only a portion of the data is used for validation, the data size is reduced. Calculation and inspection complications are reduced. As a result, transaction times are much faster, and gas fees are significantly lower.\n\nAlthough there are numerous benefits, there is still a data availability issue because the creation of new transactions requires previously valid data. While a zero-knowledge proof can convey a transaction block's validity without revealing its raw data content, it does not guarantee the availability of the data required to build future transactions. The current solution is to either attach the raw transaction together or to have a third party verify the information's validity. These methods, however, have some trade-offs, such as performance loss due to data size or loss of decentralization.\n\nWhile transparency is one of the benefits of blockchain, it is also a disadvantage and a barrier to adoption in many cases because our transactions can be seen by anyone. For example, if a company wants to use cryptocurrency to pay for goods, transparency allows competitors to access this company's information such as product cost, trading partners, or for serious traders, transparency is bad for them because their strategy or some secret data is no longer secret. All of this transparency data can be used to launch attacks or be exploited by malicious individuals.\n\nThe examples above are just a few of the constraints that make cryptocurrency or blockchain implementation less feasible than it should be. So this is one of the important topics that many people are attempting to solve at the moment, and one solution is to make the transactions private so that others cannot see the details.\n\nHowever, these solutions are still insufficient to meet the needs. Because of the lack of transparency, we are unable to verify those transactions and determine whether they are being used properly. This makes it difficult for agencies and corporations to accept and implement.\n\n> ## This is where EspressoSYS, the giant project, comes in.\n\nEspresso is a layer 1 blockchain project that integrates the ZK-Rollup into its consensus from the beginning, allowing the ZK-Rollup to work flawlessly with Espresso. As a result, it can complete the transaction faster while keeping the gas fees low. In other words, it can be considered Decentralized ZK-Rollups, and ZK-Rollups can be used without any disadvantages when compared to other methods.\n\nEspresso has also created the Configurable Asset Privacy (CAP) protocol, which allows users to add custom privacy to digital assets. The first CAP application is CAPE (Configurable Asset Privacy for Ethereum), a smart contract application that can run on any EVM blockchain, including Espresso.\n\nCAPE allows users to create new assets independently of other existing assets (domestic CAPE assets) or to wrap existing assets (ERC-20s and ERC-721s). During the creation process, creators can configure the asset's viewing policies to specify what information they want a specific group of people to be able to read and review, for example:\n\n* The sender's and receiver's addresses\n* The amount of assets to be sent, received, or held\n* The asset type to be sent, received, or held\n\nFurthermore, the asset's creator can specify a party that can suspend transactions via freezing policies.\n\nCAPE can meet the needs of both general users who want transaction privacy and asset issuers who want the benefit of transparency and the ability to suspend suspicious transactions. This allows us to prevent money laundering, fraud, and a variety of other issues that the current solution cannot address.\n\nWith CAPE, ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets can now instantly add privacy property to their transactions by wrapping and can unwrap to the original asset whenever they no longer require the CAPE protection. CAPE also supports credential issuers, so we can use it to enable activities with a much broader scope (e.g. usage for Permissioned DeFi).\n\n## UTxO is the next Model ?\n\nCAPE uses the UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, which takes existing unspent outputs (or records) as input and generates new unspent outputs (UTxO) from the transaction. The user will be the owner of the records, which will include the type of asset, amount, and owner address. CAPE also creates the commitments associated with these records and stores them in the CAPE’s Records Merkel Tree.\n\nThe CAPE Wallet creates the new transaction before passing it on to the Relayer, who will then submit it to the CAPE Smart Contract for verification and submission to Ethereum. The Relayer will pay the gas fees and activate the CAPE Smart Contract, preventing others from linking the transaction to the user. Furthermore, the CAPE Wallet will save the user's records as the local state and will update them as needed. This lets users know when someone has sent them something.\n\nWhen creating a transaction, the sender must use his own private key to consume his own unspent records in order to generate new records. The records will contain the record commitments, a list of nullifiers (used to mark the records as spent without disclosing the record content), a zero-knowledge proof to verify that the transaction has computed correctly, and owner memos that contain some of the transaction's data, such as the type and number of assets. The owner memos are encrypted with the encrypted public key (obtained from the CAPE Address Book, the component that maps the wallet address to the encrypted public key) of the receiver (the new owner of that record), allowing the receiver to decrypt and view the record content.\n\nAside from the receiver, the person holding the viewing key can read owner memos as well. This enables the viewing key holder to observe the asset's usage (in the scope that was specified by the viewing policies).\n\nCAPE is Espresso's first application, but it can instantly add the privacy property to all existing ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets when it goes live. Regular users like us can send and receive without worrying about our privacy, and the asset issuer can also monitor how their own assets are being used and suspend improper transactions. Of course, this can greatly broaden the scope of blockchain because it removes one of the major barriers to blockchain adoption.\n\nAs a result, Espresso could be a significant step toward increasing blockchain adoption and could be used to create many new products in the future. Furthermore, it may play an important role in the unprecedented application of blockchain.\nThis is only the beginning of Espresso's history, and we are all witnesses to this beginning.\n\n## ____________________________________________________\n\n### Special Event with ContributionDAO : Lets contribute in Knowledge Bounty of EspressoSYS to get POAP and Soulbound.\n\n> ***You can Contribute with Interesting projects for increase Contributor IT skills such as How to coding / testnet / run node .***\n\n**2 Tasks :**\n\n1\\.[Creating Privacy Infrastructure For Web 3.0](https://contributiondao.com/bounties/62dbc359bd5169e49f29ef61/.)

3 级）。每个用户有四个神秘盒子插槽。神秘盒子有 10 种品质。收到神秘盒子后，倒计时会自动开始。当倒计时结束时，用户会花费少量 $GST（“基本成本”）来打开它。倒计时持续时间随着神秘盒子的质量而增加。\n\n运动鞋质量\n\n运动鞋有五种品质（普通、罕见、稀有、史诗和传奇）。铸造运动鞋时，每个属性的值都是在运动鞋质量决定的最小值和最大值之间随机选择的。因此，即使是相同品质的 Sneaker，也可能有着明显不同的属性等级。当达到某些里程碑时，用户需要消耗 $GMT 来升级他们的运动鞋。 \n\n‍ 制鞋业\n\n在造鞋活动 (SME) 期间，用户使用他们拥有的两个运动鞋作为蓝图来“繁殖”，创建一个鞋盒。作为参考，这两款 Sneaker 将被称为 Vintages（父母）。\n\n为了开始 SME，两个 Vintage 都必须由用户拥有（非租用）并且完全耐用。然后，用户可以通过访问 Mint 选项卡、选择 Sneaker 并按下 Mint 来选择要“繁殖”的 Sneaker。两种年份都有 72 小时的铸币冷却时间，但在此期间它们仍可用于移动。在此处了解铸币成本。\n\n来源\n\n‍\n\n游戏模式\n\n独奏模式\n\n用户通过穿着 NFT 运动鞋在单人模式中赚取代币。需要能源才能赚取 $GST。只有在用户获得 NFT 运动鞋后才会补充能量：1 能量等于 5 分钟的 Move-to-Earn 运动。 \n\n马拉松模式（开发中）\n\n马拉松模式要求用户提前 24 小时在 Marathon Tab 下注册。马拉松将每周和每月举行一次。在此处了解有关每周马拉松和每月马拉松的更多信息。\n\n‍\n\n市场低迷影响STEPN\n\nSTEPN 代币的价格随着整体熊市而下跌，因为治理代币和实用代币均较今年早些时候的历史高点下跌了 80% 至 98%。在 4 月达到顶峰时，$GMT 和 $GST 分别为 4.19 美元和 9.36 美元。此后，两个代币均呈下行趋势，形势严峻。\n\n来源：GST 代币图表\n来源：GMT 代币图表\n\n一些社区成员将代币的急剧下降归因于 STEPN 应用程序在中国被禁止。 \n\n“自从中国禁赛以来，这就是一场大屠杀，价格大幅下跌，以至于对于小跑步者/步行者来说，去散步几乎没有回报。” 一位 STEPN 用户和\nBSC 新闻\n的密切接触者说。“Solana 和 GST 的价格下降了，鞋子变得非常便宜（我的鞋子损失惨重）。”\n\n在 STEPN 流行的高峰期，用户可以通过在单人模式下在附近慢跑来赚取数百美元。即使使用基本运动鞋，也有可能以 9.36 美元的最高价格获得 3-4 美元 GST 的 NFT 每日奖励。目前，同样的步行，在 4 月份可以为用户赚取高达 40 美元的收益，但收益仅为 0.82 美元左右。\n\n以前，使用 Solana NFT 的成本约为 600 美元，获得正的投资回报率大约需要 16 天。但目前，截至 7 月 14 日，购买最便宜的 Sneaker 的成本约为 69.88 美元。以目前的价格点，投资者需要大约 145 天才能达到收支平衡，每天的回报为 0.70 美元。结果，一些社区成员之间出现了看跌情绪。\n\n“有些人还在玩游戏……我的意思是，距离禁令还有一个月的时间……如果我在中国，我会舒服地玩游戏，等到 7 月 10 日扔掉我的运动鞋离开。” STEPN Discord 的一位社区成员说。\n\n‍\n\n积极推动\n\n该公司在一篇Medium 帖子中表示，尽管过去几个月加密市场状况有所下降，但 STEPN 第二季度的利润为 1.225 亿美元。\n\n资源\n\nM2E 协议计划利用其利润的 5% 为其 GMT 代币启动回购和销毁计划。然而，为防止价格突然波动，回购和销毁过程“可能需要几周时间才能完成”。\n\n此外，开发人员表示，除了回购和销毁计划之外，STEPN 将分配资本储备来改进现有功能并建立团队。尽管该协议面临挑战，但许多人仍然保持乐观。\n\n“如果 STEPN 团队最终确定了他们的产品并开始了大规模的营销活动，那么事情仍然可能再次上升。散步或跑步的赚钱部分吸引了许多人，他们只是还不知道，或者还不习惯使用加密钱包，”一位接近\nBSC 新闻\n的 STEPN 成员说。“为了让 STEPN 成功，我认为他们需要针对没有加密领域经验的人开展大型营销活动，我认为他们应该为不了解私钥等的人提供托管钱包。 ” \n\nSTEPN 报告称，该公司已经确定了几个投资其赚取资本的领域，以便改进游戏玩法。其中包括安全增强、防止机器人获得 GMT 的反作弊机制、建立开发人员和核心团队，以及确保赞助和合作伙伴关系。\n\n“我投入了很多。我现在不担心回报，因为我专注于长期。现在，我正在增加我在两条链上的持股量，增加我的主要鞋子，并为第三领域做准备，”一位社区成员说。\n\n在 SOL领域和 BNB 领域取得成功之后，STEPN 打算在以太坊上引入APE 领域。\n\nSTEPN 团队将这个 Realm 描述为“一个拥抱时尚和其他 NFT 社区的伟大实验”。\n\nAPE Realm 将为所有 STEPN 用户提供对创新的新 Realm 的访问，专注于可访问性和引入新用户。 \n\n资料来源： STEPN 路线图\n\n‍\n\n离别的思念\n\n由于行业低迷，以及中国数据法禁止存储公民 GPS 数据，STEPN 不得不屏蔽中国用户。此外，STEPN 的平台自推出以来一直受到一系列分布式拒绝服务 (DDoS) 攻击，导致用户在维护期间被警告“可能无法正确记录锻炼”。\n\n然而，如果 STEPN 克服了这些障碍，加密货币市场可能会成为一个蓬勃发展的行业。此外，如果它的经济激励措施能激励一些人离开沙发开始行动，那也是一件好事。\n\n来源\n\nSTEPN 社区在社交媒体上非常活跃，仅在 Twitter 上就有超过 640,000 名关注者。许多用户在 NFT 市场上创造了高流动性，使升级后的运动鞋更容易出售。最后但同样重要的是，即将到来的租赁升级和以太坊上的 Ape Realm 应该会增加用户群，增加所有代币的价值。\n\n‍\n\n什么是步骤：\n\nSTEPN 是一个结合了 GameFi 和 SocialFi 元素的 Web3 应用程序，允许用户 Move & Earn（移动和赚取）。用户将通过步行、慢跑或户外跑步来获得游戏内代币。STEPN 在 GST 和 GMT 两种代币机制下运行（治理代币，供应有限）。\n\n在哪里可以找到 StepN：\n\n网站| 推特| 不和谐| 白皮书](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mq9ywQUQkQn4xrVLCuztz.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658571669, "digest": "L2MFKUE-N3qI-VB_uqEjrdassOG2Q-jB_o3eLFuYJEw", "contributor": "0x52de7ebD426a0Bc6dbF2b51785cA19E71529E97c"}

{"id": "Yc5BcExUs_vhkEbqYqQKOdTzRE7WsLU4KioftwjHIgw", "title": "绘画，作为动作知觉——大众实践与自我关怀", "body": "我们身处图像时代，而绘画却因其古老而单调的形式失去了往日的光彩。参展第十二届上海双年展“禹步”的六十余位艺术家中，仅有两位艺术家的作品涉及绘画形式，并以手稿或与其他艺术形式（如摄影）结合呈现。在大量炫目的装置、表演、影像之中，我们甚至无法觉察绘画作品的存在；或许绘画作为一切艺术形式的原点——如同史前文明洞穴里寥寥几笔的野牛一般，以帧的快速叠加成为动态影像、以平面的空间叠加成为装置，隐身于形态各异的艺术作品中。而回归纯粹的绘画形式本身，它不可避免、无法否认地衰退了。1996年第一届上海双年展的作品以油画为主，两年后第二届以水墨画为主，而20年后的今天，绘画从绝对主角退居幕后，仅在装置艺术家的手稿里闪烁着其身影。绘画在艺术社会中遭遇达尔文主义式淘汰了吗？其意义又将何去何从？\n\n绘画最初是人们认识自然的途径。探索欲与好奇心使人们以感性、模糊的轮廓试图留下流动世界的转瞬即逝；因此绘画及其基本工具，作为艺术史的“普罗米修斯之火”使人之为人——审美的人。古希腊柏拉图声称绘画（艺术）不过是对理念世界的摹仿，绘画在追求普遍善的形而上狂热中，经历了第一次低谷。而随着作为科学理性认知的透视法出现，绘画再次成为理解客观世界的有效工具，它以科学的名义试图拓宽人类知识的边界——如达芬奇的维特鲁威人，人们从外在自然世界转向人体内部，而绘画是其桥梁。艺术家在绘画的历史中逐渐拥有姓名，而作为个体的人也在启蒙运动中浮现出了清晰的面目，视觉和心灵加工使绘画承载着人们对世界的感性认知。甚而在之后的抽象绘画中，其为不可见幻想的描绘，“画外之意”成为绘画不可捉摸、无法证明的意义。当相机取代了扬·凡·艾克笔下的真实，新媒体的白噪音使艺术的广场热闹非凡，作为前浪的绘画似乎完成了其历史使命。绘画终究在当代艺术的土壤里成为不起眼的沉睡者了吗？而它又将会在哪里苏醒？\n\n绘画作为古老的艺术形式，随着艺术边界不断扩展，与其他媒介融合共生。同时，绘画将作为“动作”重新进行自我定位，在聒噪熵增的资本信息时代拥有其无可替代的意义。在器官学的驯化下，人们在工业生产中发生了“感性第一次机械转向”，失去了生产姿态的知识。而后大众在消费洗脑以及大数据预判中，不断放弃自身实践与感知的知识。一无所有的人们唯有在无形的控制中自我麻痹，快乐而虚无；感知力终将集体走失，爱与欲望沦为了爆点——在热搜上停留不过两天。相比诸如京剧的票友们，心痒痒总想唱上一曲，我们的“热爱”仅限于远观——喜欢电影就去电影院，喜欢音乐就买张电子专辑，喜欢艺术就去看展。实践的缺失亟待唤回绘画的身体性“涂写”，人们需要在投入的绘画动作中进入自身的沉思性时刻。而绘画的意义便在于，在反思与否定的沉思性辩证中，它使人的精神实现自我跃迁，从而对抗信息泛滥下的艺术炫技，转而关注内容、关注自身，重新获得艺术与生活的感知力与批判力。“涂画者”进行着逆熵实践，如写实主义油画大家冷军，苦行般沉溺其中——绘画成为了使信徒平静的耶路撒冷。\n\n同时，绘画形式与工具的质朴性使其成为大众无门槛的表达方式。从油画布-颜料到纸-笔，再到ipad-procreate(Apple的绘画app)，绘画的技术输出在不断形变的同时，绘画并没有消失——仅仅表明绘画逐渐成为随时随地可进行的动作-实践。绘画时人们握笔的姿态，导向了先前失去的知识的回归，并在直接的手-线条输出中，获得未经过键盘、鼠标甚至代码转译的直接经验，从而实现去-无产阶级化。而当绘画在广泛的大众化涂写-实践中掉下神坛、渗透人们的日常生活，原本的绘画使人觉醒还是在定义的无限稀释与扩展中被人们加速遗忘？\n\n我们无法否认，在当下，绘画不再仅仅服务于贵族权势，在简单、可获得的涂写动作中，它向所有人开放，并作为疗愈人心的药丸，面对在时代的精神暴力之下、过分积极而倦怠的人们，在专注的动作-实践中发挥药效——是视觉型人类的自我关怀。图像时代，我们被爆炸的视觉信息所淹没，也将在自我图像绘制的动作中进行解救。班克斯式的绘画社会参与，以及 Black Lives Matter 运动中无所不在的街头涂鸦，正说明着绘画-图像以一目了然、人人都懂的方式激发了大众的共情。绘画成为大众的武器，从艺术展览的白盒子跃入大众的日常生活，觉醒其存在的意义。\n\n\\*写于2020", "timestamp": 1658574482, "digest": "gQJgUdhaFIEoViAlkLkNu7Qn9xKedNzw6ZRd-lEirlo", "contributor": "0xf7601fb539609D9622D129b7645c48999C2ED098"}

This information could include your IP address, operating system, and geography.\n\nAll it takes is the creator placing an image URL in the NFT ‘s metadata that points to a machine they control that logs the request. Many web servers like Apache and NGINX can do this by default. The team at HOPR have created a series of Non-Private NFTs that show this vulnerability.\n\n> Note: this is in addition to the data a wallet like MetaMask leaks to RPC providers. You can learn more about this by checking out [DERP (Dumb Ethereum RPC Provider)](https://derp.hoprnet.org/) from the HOPR team.\n\nYou can see them generated live at their [Non-Private NFT](https://non-private-nft.hoprnet.org/) tool. They have a great post on explaining how it works and why it’s bad: [Your NFT Might be Watching You](https://medium.com/hoprnet/your-nft-might-be-watching-you-8c7ec078788f). They also have a [Non-Private NFT](https://github.com/hoprnet/non-private-nft) GitHub repo that shows how the collection could work.\n\nBelow, you can see a NFT I generated using the tool. I viewed the NFT three different ways: in my MetaMask wallet on Android, directly in Chrome, and on OpenSea.\n\n![When viewed in MetaMask on Android](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2KfGI8ulE0Q7BBJNE0fbk.png?height=900&width=600)\n\n![When viewed directly in Chrome on my laptop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0bm3nCSWYWVcLoBwuQc9L.png?height=900&width=600)\n\n![When viewed on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fbmhUMspXFlNRhjIe6ro9.png?height=900&width=600)\n\nIn the first two examples, the NFT shows my actual information. However, the OpenSea example is a different since their servers cache and serve the image. In that case, it shows the information of the AWS server OpenSea used to request the image. In each case, you can see the information is different.\n\nYou can see these NFT images generated live using HOPR’s [Non-Private NFT](https://non-private-nft.hoprnet.org/) tool. There’s a great Medium post explaining how it works and why it’s bad: [Your NFT Might be Watching You](https://medium.com/hoprnet/your-nft-might-be-watching-you-8c7ec078788f). There’s a corresponding [Non-Private NFT](https://github.com/hoprnet/non-private-nft) GitHub repo that shows how the collection could work.\n\nThis is a pretty clear case to demonstrate the need for web3 metadata privacy. Luckily, there are web3 privacy projects in the works to address this. One of which is HOPR, an incentivized mixnet enabling privacy-preserving point-to-point data exchange. It can be compared to Tor but with incentives for noderunners.

NFT 是一种利用区块链技术的非同质化数字资产，它正在吞噬世界。**我们喜欢 NFT， 没有 NFT 就没有 web3**，没有元宇宙，没有下一次数字艺术革命，没有下一代的社交网络。\n2. 世界上的所有人都将拥有 NFT，不管是主动购买还是被动赠送的。不管是艺术品，还是游戏道具，不管是会员卡，还是人生成就。\n3. **但我们讨厌现在的 NFT**。它充斥着 垃圾美术，白名单奴隶，版权暴君，价格操控，无聊仿盘，哗众取众和抢夺注意力。在给玩家带来收益的同时，带来了焦虑、劳累、盗版 和 假新闻。社区假装拥护，在价格下跌的时候一哄而散。名人和 KOL 收费推广一些垃圾项目，只是为了骗大家接盘；或者只购买有名气的蓝筹，却从不参与到社区和文化中。哪怕是你的童年偶像，他们也经常不尊重 NFT。**这是我们想要的吗，把 web3 的影响力拱手让给骗子和旧媒体的统治者？**\n4. NFT 背叛了艺术家。仿盘兴起，真正优秀的艺术家却被埋没。NFT 的价格背叛了创意。有些 NFT 是有趣的实验，你我都愿意支持，但有些 NFT 只是无聊的虚伪的骗局。\n5. 原本我们希望 NFT 能帮助独立画师和独立游戏开发者找到一条新的路线，通过自己的才华和 idea 筹集到足够全职投入的资金，和社区一起创作和成长。但是市场并没有朝这个方向发展。所以我们打算分出一部分的精力来做点什么。\n\n*English version:*  *NFT is really good and can shape the future. No nft No metaverse. But NFT nowadays sucks. We want to do something. Thank you.*\n\n## 我们想打造什么样的 NFT？\n\n我们觉得一个好的 NFT 项目应该是这样的：\n\n1. 美术上，它不需要是一个惊艳的艺术品，但至少有主题有故事，能看出团队认真的投入。**它要有独特的风格和气质，应该像优秀的文学作品一样，代表了某类人或某个社会现象**。它不应该有太高的审美门槛，人们对它有情感上的认同，愿意为它发声。有创意的人可以简单地围绕它进行创作，甚至有成为 meme 的潜质。\n2. 权利上，NFT 在技术上是可互通和可组合的，而且在美术和商业化权利上也应该是这样的。但大多数项目在美术设计、技术规格 和 版权上并没有这么做。他们假装是先进的，其实是保守的；他们把所有权给了用户，却把 IP 和品牌抓在自己手里。我们要消除让社区围绕这个 IP 进行再创作、商业化甚至是创业的一切阻碍。**你可以对这个项目做任何不违反法律和人类道德的事，唯一禁止的自由是禁止别人的自由。**\n3. 运营上是社区驱动的。项目的数量、发行价、发行规则，都是为了社区服务，而不是自身盈利。系列的数量不应该是固定的，应该随着社区逐渐扩大。大多数系列控制数量主要是为了控制价格，我们会有节奏地放开。**而不是发行子系列并借此划分不同的阶层**，**猴子不会比狗高一等**。我们真诚地对待社区，相信社区也会给予我们信任和回报。\n4. 氛围上，不要这么严肃正经。在一个充满了创意、艺术和年轻人的新领域里，严肃是最扫兴的事。我们喜欢烂梗，太特么喜欢烂梗了。要不是需要写这篇文章，我甚至不想好好说话。我们一直活跃在各个烂梗群里，讽刺一切能看到的事物，包括我们自己。**要用最直观的搞笑，对抗这个充斥着严肃、控制和虚伪的成人世界。**\n5. 它最好是平等的。NFT 的价值不是由创作者决定的，而是由拥有者决定的。团队有多大名气不重要，你们觉得它值多少钱，就是多少钱。共识是价格的基础，社区是项目的根基。任何参与者在社区里都是平等的，可能团队和一些名人有更多的资源和影响力，**但他们在社区地位上是平等的。**\n6. 它最好是首创性的， 有历史纪念意义的。人们不会经常追捧和炒作它，但人们不会忘记它。哪怕有一天归零了，大家也感慨它曾经辉煌过。\n\n我们不仅把 NFT 看成是未来，也把它看成人生。因为我们的人生也是一个 NFT，没有人是相同的，所有人都是奇怪的。欢迎上车！\n\n*English version:  Good NFT is like a great literature. You can do anything except break the law. We listen to our community. We fxxking like meme. It should be unique and memorable. Our life is also like a NFT. No one is fungible but every one is strange. Welcome aboard!*\n\n## 关于路线图\n\n没有。我们会有活动，但永远不会有明确的 Roadmap。拥抱变化，这应该是我们之间的默契和信任。我们会跟社区一起成长，探索新的共建方式，鼓励亚洲文化叙事和创意。我们会不定期放出一些线索和谜语，聪明和忠诚的社区参与者将会获得第一手信息。也随时欢迎大家补充新的 idea。\n\n对于收益的使用。首先用来感谢初始团队的付出，并流向那些对社区有贡献的人。我们会支持所有这个 IP 的衍生项目，支持社区里一些奇怪的多媒体创意。我们不把加密货币视为一种真的现金来源，也不以此为生，**而是视为一种信任和资源，可以帮助我们做更多有意思的尝试。**\n\n事实上我有能力开发一个 3D metaverse，但那会将大多数人拒之门外，而且没有灵魂。**沉浸式体验只是躯壳，NFT 社区才是灵魂**。如果你真的想要开创一个有价值的新宇宙，你最需要的是第一批愿意和你同行的信徒。\n\n总的来说，我们不会做任何事情，直到我们想到并选出最有意思的那个 idea；我们不会 rug，直到社区把我们彻底遗忘。\n\n*English version:  No roadmap. Just pixel, puzzle and passion.*\n\n## 关于像素和 CC0\n\n我们认为 NFT 消除了流通的技术门槛，像素会降低流通的美术门槛，CC0 会消除流通的心理和权利门槛。\n\n1. **CC0 才是真正的 NFT**。因为你的商业化方式应该绝对不同于传统 IP，不要在新世界重复旧的商业手段，有效但无聊。\n2. **像素是一种低保真的美术形式，粉丝们有更广阔的发挥空间**。可能更进一步的就只有简笔画和 Loot了。精美的插画和 3D 美术当然也很棒，但你不觉得它太具体了，很难让人参与进去吗？好的艺术从来不是技术上的竞赛。而且像素不会把所有信息告诉你，你始终要调用自己的想象力。\n3. 所以 **CC0 x NFT x Pixel，这就是我们能想到的最酷的数字时代 IP 打造方式**。这里感谢 [Simon de la Rouviere 文章](https://blog.simondlr.com/posts/expansive-nft-universes-cc0-fidelity-on-chain-bundling#disqus_thread) 的启发。\n\n我们也很怀念那个充满像素游戏的繁荣年代。某种程度上，我们把 NFT 这个基础设施也看成类似 switch 和 steam 的创意游戏平台。\n\n*English version:  CC0 NFT is the real NFT. CC0 x NFT x Pixel is the best.*\n\n## 关于团队\n\n**发起人**：\n\n我叫 chenboos，[推特也叫这个](https://twitter.com/chenboos5)。以前是个日漫狂热者，后来是互联网公司的产品经理，目前是一名 AI 和 Web3 行业的创业者。人生最终的目标是想当一名作家。我做过一些拙劣的社交 app，也做过我们国家的第一个 NFT App。Strxnger 是我的第二个 side project，我从来不会停止思考和白日梦，你可以关注我的推特（@chenboos5）或即刻（@陈不撕）了解更多。\n\n**艺术家团队：**\n\n[@闪爷](https://twitter.com/XMY1984)   [@沼蛙](https://twitter.com/Umbra_Onovich)   [@懒觉](https://twitter.com/lanjoy0)  [@yilang](https://twitter.com/Yilang2022) ……\n\n他们在画图，还没空写自我介绍，不过推特上的作品都很精彩，推荐看看。\n\n**开发团队：**\n\n还没写\n\n**营销团队：**\n\n我们目前没有专门的市场和运营团队，完全依赖社区。所以甚至没有专门的Discord，大家都是中国人，就不要装了。等老外粉丝足够多的话再考虑吧。如果你希望参与国内运营或帮助我们建立海外社区，可以联系 chenboos，互相学习探索。\n\n**突出的社区贡献者：**\n\n名字再找他们要……\n\n**合作伙伴**\n\nX兔，Nxxt DAO，DXS，BXT DAO，小 X 灵，镭X猫，河X人，NFTXO，NFTtxxck …… （以上均未达成合作，还没和各位老板聊）\n\n## 感谢名单\n\nRespect to [CryptoPunks](https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts), [Hashmasks](https://twitter.com/TheHashmasks), [NounsDAO](https://twitter.com/nounsdao), [mfer,](https://twitter.com/sartoshi_nft) [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), [forgotten runes](https://twitter.com/forgottenrunes) , [punk6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529).感谢你们的启发，虽然不赞同你们的全部。\n\n感谢青蛙。\n\n**早期怪人群（一群已满，二群开放中），欢迎参与和围观。**\n\n**\\~\\~可以加入中转群，\\~\\~若满员可以添加微信号：** Web3-V\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KAvABWxHOqVHQKqzhszuS.png?height=1371&width=1056)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658575717, "digest": "m7t8EsG3alEcxh74VmspIG-Mk4O5OIFldyC2x0mRIlo", "contributor": "0x8C6ee8f98282210dfFb57ed29606b11dF5304fbA"}

Our mission is to create the most incredible pixel IP and games in Web 3.0 with the community in a brand-new way. It’s time for you to pass on the aesthetics of pixels and amplify the spirit of CC0, with a puzzle-like roadmap and an unconstrained community, if you fancy weirdos, Strxngers is what you would fall in love to.\n\nHere are the translations of Strxngers in different areas in China:\n\\-\"异人\" in Mainland China (voted by the community)\n\\-“怪咖” in Hong Kong (voted by the team)\n\\-“接头霸王”in Taiwan (voted by the team)\n**Scroll down to the end of the article for ways to join the community.**\n\n## How do we perceive NFTs?\n\n1. NFT as a non-fungible digital asset, utilizes blockchain technology and is invading the world. **We adore NFTs, without which there would not be Web 3.0, metaverse, next art revolution or new generation of social network.**\n2. NFTs will be owned by everybody in the world, whether they are purchased or gifted, as artworks or game props, as membership card or life accomplishment.\n3. **However, some of the NFTs nowadays sucks.** It's full of junky art, whitelisted slaves, copyright tyrants, price manipulation, boring copycats, grandstanding and attention grabbing. While bringing benefits to players, it brings anxiety, fatigue, piracy and fake news. The community pretended to be supportive and broke up when prices fall. Celebrities and KOLs charge to promote some junky projects just to cheat the follow buyers; or they only buy famous blue chips, but never participate in the community and culture. Even your childhood idols often disrespect NFTs. **Is this what we want? To cede the influence of Web 3.0 to crooks and rulers of the old media?**\n4. NFTs betray the real artist. Counterfeit NFTs are on the rise, but truly outstanding artists are buried. The price of NFTs betrays creativity. Some NFTs are interesting experiments that we are both willing to support, but some are just boring fake scams.\n5. Originally, we hoped that NFTs could help independent artists and independent game developers find a new route, raise enough money for full-time involvement, and create and grow with the community. But the market is not moving in that direction. So we're going to devote some of our effort to doing something.\n\n## What kind of NFT do we want to create?\n\nWe think a good NFT project should look like this:\n\n* In terms of art, it does not need to be an amazing artwork, but at least has a theme and a story, which shows the deep engagement of the team. **It should have a unique style and temperament, and should represent a certain kind of person or a certain social phenomenon such as an excellent literary work.** It should not have too high aesthetic threshold. People would have emotional identification with it and are willing to speak for it. Creators can simply create around it and even have the potential to become a meme.\n* In terms of rights, NFT is technically interoperable and composable, and it should be the same in terms of art and commercialization. However, most projects don't do that in terms of art, technical specs, and copyright. They pretend to be advanced, but they are actually conservative. They give ownership to users, but take the IP and brand into their own hands. We want to remove any barriers to getting the community to recreate, commercialize, or even start a business around this IP. **You can do anything with this project that is not against the law and human morals. The only forbidden freedom is the freedom of forbidding others.**\n* The operation is community-driven. The mint number, price, and rules are all served for the community, not self-profit. The number of collections should not be fixed and should gradually expand with the community. The reason why most of the collections control quantity is mainly to control the price, so we will release the collections themselves gradually rather than release sub-collections and use them to divide the hierarchy. **Apes are no higher than dogs. We treat our community with sincerity and believe that the community will also give us trust in return.**\n* In terms of atmosphere, don't be so serious. In a new field full of creativity, art and young people, keeping serious is the worst thing to do. We love bad memes so much. If it wasn't for the need to write this article, I wouldn't even want to talk properly. We've been active in various groups, satirizing everything we can see, including ourselves. **Just fight against this adult world of seriousness, control, and hypocrisy with the most intuitive hilarity.**\n* It had better be equal. The value of NFT is not determined by the creator, but by the owner. It doesn't matter how famous the team is, just how much you think it's worth. Consensus is the foundation of the price, and the community is the foundation of the project. Any participant is equal in the community, maybe the team and some celebrities have more resources and influence, **but they are equal in the community status.**\n* It had better be unique and memorable. People might not often chase and fomo it, but will never forget it. Even if it returns to zero one day, everyone feels that it has brought something good to them.\n\nWe not only see NFT as the future, but also as life. **Because our life is also an NFT, no one is the same, everyone is strange. Welcome aboard!**\n\n## The Roadmap\n\nNo roadmap. We will have events, but never a clear roadmap. Embracing change should be the tacit understanding and trust between us. We will grow with the community, explore new ways to build together, and encourage Asian cultural narratives and creativity. We will release some clues and puzzles from time to time, and smart and loyal community participants will get first-hand information. You are also welcomed to add new ideas at any time.\n\nAbout use of proceeds. Firstly, it will be used to thank the initial team for their efforts, and flows to those who have contributed to the community. We'll support all derivative projects from this IP and support some of the fanciful multimedia ideas in the community. **We don't see cryptocurrencies as a real source of cash, and we don't make a living from it, but as a trust and a resource that can help us do more interesting experiments.**\n\nIn fact, I have the ability to develop a 3D metaverse, but that would shut out most people and be soulless. **The immersive experience is just the shell, and the NFT community is the soul.** If you really want to start a worthwhile new universe, what you need most is the first group of believers who are willing to walk with you. In general, we won't do anything until we think of and pick the most interesting idea; we won't rug until the community completely forgets us.\n\n## Pixel Art & CC0\n\nWe believe that NFT eliminates the technical threshold of circulation, pixels will lower the artistic threshold of circulation, and CC0 will eliminate the psychological and rights threshold of circulation.\n\n1. **CC0 is the real NFT.** The way you commercialize should be absolutely different from traditional IP, and never repeat the old commercial methods which is effective but boring in the new world.\n2. **Pixels are a low-fidelity art form, using which fans have a wider space to create.** Besides, there are only stick figures and Loots that could go further. Beautiful illustrations and 3D art are of course great, but it's too specific to get people involved, right? Good art is never a technical competition. The pixel doesn't tell you everything, so you always have to use your imagination.\n3. **So CC0 x NFT x Pixel, this is the coolest way to build IP in the digital age we can think of.** Thanks to [Simon de la Rouviere's article](https://blog.simondlr.com/posts/expansive-nft-universes-cc0-fidelity-on-chain-bundling#disqus_thread) for inspiration.\n   We also miss the boom years full of pixel games. To a certain extent, we also regard the NFT infrastructure as a creative game platform similar to switch and steam.\n\n## The Team\n\n**Director:**\n\nMy name is Chenboos, also the account name of Twitter. Formerly a Japanese manga fanatic, then a product manager of an Internet company, and currently an entrepreneur in the AI and Web3 industries. The ultimate goal in life is to be a writer. I've made some crappy social apps and the first NFT app in our country. Strxnger is my second side project, I never stop thinking and daydreaming, you can follow me on Twitter ([@chenboos5](https://twitter.com/chenboos5)) or Jike (@陈不撕) to learn more.\n\n**Art Team:**\n\n[@闪爷](https://twitter.com/XMY1984) [@沼蛙](https://twitter.com/Umbra_Onovich) [@懒觉](https://twitter.com/lanjoy0) [@yilang](https://twitter.com/Yilang2022) ……\n\nThey are drawing pictures and haven't had time to write about themselves, but the work on Twitter is very exciting, I recommend checking them out.\n\n**Tech Team:**\n\nNot written yet.\n\n**Marketing Team:**\n\nWe currently do not have a dedicated marketing and operations team and are completely dependent on the community. So we don’t run a Discord group. Almost everyone in the community now is Chinese, so don't pretend. We will wait until there are enough foreigners to consider about it. If you want to participate in domestic operations or help us build overseas communities, you can contact chenboos to learn from each other and explore.\n\n**Core Contributors:**\n\nStill asking for their names……\n\n**Partners:**\n\nXRxbbitsClub，Nxxt DAO，DXS，BXT DAO，WxirdoGhxstGxng，LxserCxt，Rxvermxn，NFTXO，NFTtxxck …… None of the above have established cooperation, and have not talked to these bosses yet.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nRespect to [CryptoPunks](https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts), [Hashmasks](https://twitter.com/TheHashmasks), [NounsDAO](https://twitter.com/nounsdao), [mfer,](https://twitter.com/sartoshi_nft) [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), [forgotten runes](https://twitter.com/forgottenrunes) , [punk6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529).

Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS. Jailbreaking a device makes everything even worse) but some of them require a lot of preparation work and do not have out of the box security! **But.** Any secure OS can't help you, if you don't care about simple security rules - keep that in mind.

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第九篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n### 第十篇20220722\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】Chainlink - 区块链与现实世界之间的桥梁\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nChainlink 是加密行业最重要的项目之一，为 Web3 经济提供了最为基础的服务：预言机。同时也提供了不少同样重要但关注度不高的服务，作者带领我们对此一探究竟。\n\n预言机喂价服务连接了链下的数据源，为链上的智能合约提供链下价格数据。Chainlink 通过交易所原始数据、数据聚合服务公司和节点运营商的多层数据集合来确保提供数据的真实、可靠和去中心化。\n\nChainlink 的储备证明服务将链下资产的情况提供给智能合约计算链上的抵押率，通过出具独立的见证报告来证明其储备资产情况，向公众证明偿付能力。重点在于可以做到实时监控，一个已知的例子：显著提升中心化稳定币储备情况的透明度。\n\n还有一些值得关注的服务：VRF 应用于链上随机数生成；Keeper 节点负责链下计算，并在符合特定条件时激发执行链上智能合约；CCIP - 信息跨链桥额外实现链下信息与区块链的传递。\n\n$LINK 目前仅作为单一的支付型通证，但也正在开发声誉与警示的质押功能，相信能够在未来强化通证属性。作者认为：下一个牛市会由什么驱动，其中一个值得讨论的主题是加密行业的外部性。其中的重要环节就是桥接外部世界与区块链的信息，而这正是 Chainlink 的价值体现。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nChainlink 是加密行业的老牌项目，站在投机角度 $LINK 上一周期已经有着极为疯狂的价格表现。不可否认的是现阶段 Chainlink 在行业内的基石作用，但无法在其身上发现新的价值增长点始终存在隐忧，以及未来的潜在破局者也存在再平衡的可能性。加密币圈本就是新陈代谢极快的行业、不进则退，但也因此保持了旺盛的生命力，促进行业的发展。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658576606, "digest": "d8j_NKsSkitklwttcKeuniPP3KmUXb2mCBAW7CwUguo", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

ERC-721 两个值得注意的小细节\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nERC-721全称Ethereum Request for Comment-721（以太坊征求意见稿第721号）。它定义了一套代码规则，用于在以太坊区块链上记录与NFT有关的信息。它为任意的NFT指定了两个标识符：合约地址和token ID，它们的结合使得NFT真正实现独一无二。但这样的设计也有两个小细节值得关注：所有权和Metadata。\n\n所有权的问题在于：购买的NFT实际没有出现在个人名下，恰恰相反是个人名字记录在购买的 NFT之中。作者将其概述为：“不是你的NFT属于你，而是你属于你的NFT”。由此引申带来的潜在风险是尽管存储在区块链上的信息不能被更改，但信息在被检索和呈现时则可能会被扭曲，这从根本上限制了非托管钱包正确显示个人拥有的所有 NFT。\n\nMetadata的风险在于：ERC-721允许NFT的相关数据存储在链下并且可以被修改，因此未经所有者许可也存在metadata被篡改的可能。NFT的metadata以JSON的链接指向数据链接，具体数据则通常储存在链下、JSON链接也通常储存在链下，也就是NFT中只存储了一个指向其JSON文件的链接。举例说明要上传一个NFT的图像，需要经过四个步骤：\n\n1\\.上传图像到网上并生成一个链接。\n\n2\\.创建一个包含该链接以及其他相关信息的JSON文件。\n\n3\\.上传JSON文件并生成另一个链接。\n\n4\\.通过ERC-721合约中的URI将NFT指向第二个链接。\n\n问题出在步骤四：ERC-721允许将NFT与一个特定URI相关联，但这个URI是可变的。标准中没有规定一个NFT的图像应该是什么样子，也没有方法允许NFT所有者确认NFT指向的图像是否是正确的图像。由此而言ERC-721智能合约的所有者想要修改其中metadata的部分，单个 NFT所有者对此是无能为力的。\n\n究其根本，在购买NFT的行为中只是在将个人的名字写入以太坊分布式账册上的某一行。尽管构建区块链的初衷是为了消除第三方风险，但现阶段如果不依赖于中心化的服务提供商，这一行将很难被访问。同时，存储在该行上的其他信息可能会在没有个人同意的情况下被更改。由此可见现阶段的NFT并不能够像钻石一样恒久永流传。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nERC-721的出世为NFT带来了原始生命力，其魅力主要来源于独一无二的特性，然而所有权问题和metadata风险证明了现阶段的NFT仍不能算作真正意义上的去中心化产品。出现问题就得尝试解决问题：本人认为首要实现合约双方的完全去中心化，其次中心化的第三方也需要通过去中心化的方式证明其有效性，相当于多出了更复杂的验证步骤，可以理解为不可能三角对效率的再次弱化。当然，如何解决这一系列难题还需要更深入讨论和更细致实践，在现实情况下实现区块链去中心化的美好初衷仍是漫漫征途。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/nft-weekly-recap-two-caveats-with-the-design-of-erc-721](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/nft-weekly-recap-two-caveats-with-the-design-of-erc-721)\n\n### 第五篇20220716\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】Optimistic Rollup 和 ZK Rollup 两类以太坊 Layer-2 解决方案对比\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nOptimism 和 Arbitrum 是目前最重要的两个以太坊 Layer-2 解决方案，都使用了 Optimistic Rollup 技术来拓展以太坊网络。zkSync 和 StarkNet 则是目前使用 ZK Rollup 技术实现扩容的两个主要Layer-2解决方案。主流以太坊 Layer-2 解决方案 Rollup 的优势主要体现在：压缩上传以太坊主网数据，分摊交易的Gas费用；同时利用 Layer-1 区块链共识机制保证其安全性；吞吐量的增长潜力也会随 Layer-1 升级同步提高。由此费用更低、安全性有保证、性能也能够满足更高需求。\n\n### Arbitrum、Optimism、zkSync和StarkNet 技术层面差异\n\nOptimistic Rollup 的 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 存在着一些本质差别。Arbitrum 使用链下执行的多轮欺诈证明，且应用 Arbitrum 虚拟机（AVM）支持所有 EVM 编译语言。Optimism 使用 Layer-1 执行的单轮欺诈证明，兼用以太坊 EVM 而仅能支持 Solidity 编译器。相比较而言，前者技术层面更为领先。\n\nZK Rollup 的 zkSync 和 StarkNet 分别使用 SNARK 和 STARK 证明机制：差别在于设置过程、可扩展性和抗量子计算机攻击能力。ZK-SNARK 必须经过一个授信的设置阶段，降低了其去中心化程度。ZK-STARK 使用可公开验证的随机数来创建无需信任的可验证系统，从而免去了对授信设置的必要，去中心化程度更高。STARK 同时具有量子弹性、计算速度和规模扩展性的优势，但现阶段存在明显的技术瓶颈，因此 SNARK 的普及度更高。\n\nOptimistic Rollup 使用争端解决程序来保护交易安全性，ZK Rollup 则使用零知识数学证明进行交易验证。前者的主要优势是计算难度相对低、硬件要求更低，更易完善的EVM兼容而有着更高的普及度。但相对而言：前者受限于中心化定序器的信任问题存在着更高的安全风险，而且后者有着更低的提款延迟，还具备在未来启用隐私交易的潜力。基于以上特点，Vitalik Buterin 认为 Optimistic Rollup 在现阶段通用 EVM 计算中更胜一筹，但随着技术迭代，ZK Rollup 可能会有更大的发展空间。\n\n### Arbitrum、Optimism、zkSync和StarkNet 生态建设与发展规划\n\nTVL：Arbitrum > Optimism > zkSync > StarkNet (Optimistic Rollup >> ZK Rollup)。四者的 Dapp 成熟度、社交活跃度与 TVL 的比较结果相似。\n\nArbitrum 主体由 Offchain Labs 负责运营，目前积极推动 Arbitrum Odyssey 的 NFT 活动为后续规划埋下伏笔。Optimism 主要通过去中心化 DAO 治理，在推出治理通证 $OP 后热度高涨，未来两年的部分重点将放在应用下一代的交互式欺诈证明、分片 Rollup 和去中心化定序器。ZK Rollup 更多的是处于基础建设阶段：zkSync 目前聚焦其 V2 Alpha 主网的发布。StarkNet 则为主网正式发布做好准备工作，值得注意的是先于 zkSync 规划了原生通证的空投。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nOptimistic Rollup 目前已实现一定的技术落地，Arbitrum 和 Optimism 具备着先发优势，生态建设也都初现规模，但寻找 Layer-2 解决方案新增长点的责任也主要落在了其肩头，希望在未来能够首先看到 Optimistic Rollup 的破局，由此将爆发惊人的价值。ZK Rollup 的发展则处于非常早期的阶段，幸运的是还有相当长的时间用以观察 zkSync 和 StarkNet 在技术落地与生态建设两个方向上的持续发展。个人认为 zkSync 和 StarkNet 真正的价值捕获更可能发生在下一个周期，价值体现也值得期待。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/optimism-vs.-arbitrum-a-complete-comparison](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/optimism-vs.-arbitrum-a-complete-comparison)\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/zksync-vs-starkware-what-s-the-difference-between-the-top-two-zk-rollups](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/market-analysis/zksync-vs-starkware-what-s-the-difference-between-the-top-two-zk-rollups)\n\n### 认知蝗虫链接：\n\n[https://buidlerdao.notion.site/94957d0ab12c4d82aab8840ed7c34f96](https://buidlerdao.notion.site/94957d0ab12c4d82aab8840ed7c34f96)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658576579, "digest": "jug5VfvexaDAeGEm5KoElF0NMnYZtmu41WPWo7SRn-A", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS.

続いてWalletFactoryコントラクトになります！\nこれは上で紹介したコントラクトをフロント側から生成したり、管理して情報を取得しやすくするために作成しているコントラクトです！\n\nこのFactoryパターンの設計が実装できるようになると独自トークン作成アプリやNFT作成アプリが開発できるようになるのでかなりオススメです！書籍でもほとんど見かけない実装パターンですが身につけて置いて損のない実装パターンだと思っています！\n\n```\n//

テストコードも最近きっちり書けるようになってきたのでテストコードも記載します。\n脆弱性云々の話はもちろんですが、フロントエンドと組み合わせた時に意図しない挙動を確認してから作り直すと色々面倒なことになるのできっちりテストコードは書いた方が良いと思えるようになってきました。（最初はめんどくさいので書いていなかったです。。）\n\n少し長いですが、たくさん書いておくとフロント側の実装をイメージできるのでReactに組み込んだ時にスムーズに開発が進められると思います！\n\n```\n/**\n

Create画面\n④ Transaction画面\n\nそれでは各画面のキャプチャを交えながらざっくりと機能の紹介をしていきます！\n\n#### ① Connect Wallet画面\n\nこの画面はウォレットを接続する前の画面になります。\n右上のボタンからConnect Walletできます！\n\n![connect.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/1299653/2627b6d7-55d8-1f8d-6edb-7b03ab09c3c4.png)\n\n#### ② Home画面\n\n続いてHome画面です！ Connect Walletして初めて表示される画面で、ここに作成したマルチシグウォレットが表形式で表示されます！\nこの画面からは各マルチシグウォレットに対して送金するための資金をdepositする機能とそれぞれのウォレットで管理しているトランザクションデータの管理画面に遷移する機能があります！\n\n![home.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/1299653/eb584f99-befd-0cbb-6029-8f4ad57a08c9.png)\n\n右側の「DEPOSIT」ボタンを押すと、ダイアログが表示されて任意の金額をスマートコントラクトに入金することができます！ 送金元からは直接は送金できないので一旦このスマートコントラクトにdepositしておいて後で送信先に送金するという流れになります！\n\n![deposit.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/1299653/80d5abbd-c776-efba-ec52-737a61703441.png)\n\n#### ③ Create画面\n\nこの画面ではマルチシグウォレットを作成することができます。作成する際に次の3つのデータを設定することができます！\n\n1. マルチシグウォレットの名前\n2. マルチシグウォレットに登録するowner (任意の数)\n3. トランザクション実行に必要となる承認の数\n\n![createWallet.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/1299653/69d628a9-6d5c-4f43-428b-4b4730de43ac.png)\n\n問題なく作成できれば、Home画面にマルチシグウォレットの情報が追加されます。\n\n#### ④ Transaction画面\n\n最後に各マルチシグウォレットが管理するトランザクションデータに関する画面です。\nこの画面では送金に応じて作成したトランザクションデータを表形式で表示し、それぞれのトランザクションに対して必要な処理を実行することができます。\n\n1. 「APPROVE」ボタンを押せば、トランザクションの内容を承認することができます\n2. 「REVOKE」ボタンを押せば、一度承認したことを取り消すことができます\n3. 「EXECUTE」ボタンを押せば、一定数以上の承認を得ている場合に限り送金のトランザクションを実行させることができます。\n\n![txs.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/1299653/accd126d-c042-9254-d1f7-0971892cc11d.png)\n\n送金用のトランザクションは、「CREATE」ボタンを押すことで作成画面が表示されるので送金先と総金額を入力してトランザクションデータを作成します。\n\n![create.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/1299653/8bfdcfce-ad43-b3a6-25da-1e42b390a856.png)\n\n画面のざっくりとした説明は以上になります！\n\n## 4. デモ\n\n最後にYoutubeに今回作成したアプリの操作デモ動画をアップロードしました！\nよろしければご覧下さい！\n\nこちらを見ていただければ上記の内容もかなりイメージしやすくなると思います！\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=romGtIu4oWI>\n\nそして是非使ってみていただければと思います！　GoerliネットワークとMunbaiネットワークで接続して貰えれば動きます！\n\n## 5. 最後に\n\n今回はかなりシンプルなマルチシグウォレットのDAppを開発してみました！\nスマートコントラクトだけでなくフロント側も作り込むとなると結構大変ですね・・。ただ、今回の開発でだいぶイメージがつきました。ビットコインと違い、イーサリアムだと自分達でマルチシグ機能を実装しなければならないのですがこれでテンプレを作れたので色々と応用していければ面白そうです！ (input data部分を色々いじれば送金以外の処理もできそう？？ NSuiteみたいなワークフロー機能なんか作れそうですね！)\n\nUI/UXの点はまだまだ残課題があるので改良の余地ありだと考えています！ Munbaiにもスマートコントラクトをデプロイしたので今開催しているPolygonのオンラインハッカソンにこのアプリを提出してみようかなんて考えています！ (というかエントリーしちゃいました笑)\n\n<https://buidlit.devpost.com/?ref_content=default&ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=portfolio>\n\n本番の運用を想定した場合には、ウォレットのアドレスに紐づく秘密鍵は厳重に管理しなければいけないし、スマートコントラクトに脆弱性があって資金が全部引き出されたりしたらおしゃかになるのでQuantStamp社のようなコード監査会社に依頼して監査も必要だと考えています。\n\n長文になりましたが、ここまで目を通していただきありがとうございました！\nもしよろしければTwitter等フォローしていただけますと幸いです！\nよろしくお願いいたします！\n\n#####

Lettering by Sun Young Oh.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9SsZ33P82e6Siwd-QwCWE.png?height=1619&width=1938&size=medium)\n\n## Time to reshape the image\n\nImages reproduced in print and on screens are mediated images. Long ago, the domain of the mediated image witnessed an elemental format war from which the *rectangular* emerged victorious. *Images. Are. Rectangular.* Every contemporary imaging medium is optimised-up-to-the-eyeballs for the rectangular. Yes, despite the fundamental *circularity* of the lenses attached to practically every camera and optical imaging device in pictorial history, their conical light has traditionally been projected onto *rectangular* canvas, *rectangular* film, and *rectangular* digital sensor. All light that exceeds these rectangular bounds was lost to an invisible void.\n\nHow did the rectangle come to command such monolithic authority? What forces will reshape mediated images in a post-lens, text-to-image and *image*-to-image era in which even the circular has been rendered obsolete? Here I share six high-level historical conceptions of the image edge and call on graphic designers, artists, and content creators to reclaim our formats from the monotony of the rectangle.\n\n————————————\n\n![Thomas Bewick, 'A History of British Birds', 1797](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8d2coJkBHl_Ln8fhrfIAJ.png?height=1191&width=2000&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## Graphic labour\n\nLook at this lazy old squire. Little does he know that the thicket in which he is snoozing is the site of tireless graphic labour! While he wastes an afternoon, Thomas Bewick, his creator, toils at an unyielding hardwood surface with a steel burin. Hunched over his work table, Bewick can justify only those marks necessary to convey the scene. His edges exploit and disguise this constraint by assuming the naturalistic contours of clouds, leaves, rocks and grasses.\n\n————————————\n\n![Nineteenth century photograph, artist unknown](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2SRzw94ZCfD2EpyHJQ8iL.png?height=2000&width=2000&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## Liquid epoch\n\nDo you see it? A magical being preserved by a moment of alchemy! Photography itself begins as a fluid apparition, an image emerging from liquid chemistry that *stains* its substrate unpredictably. This anonymous early photographer hopes only to *invoke*, not *master* these elusive processes. Enthral to the sheer wonder of their images, they care not for formal neatness. This image displays its unstable edges unashamedly.\n\n————————————\n\n![Nineteenth century portrait, artist unknown](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J-0e-Q9crLvsT2qMqIOIo.png?height=1683&width=1683&)\n\n## Tight spaces\n\nThe early history of photography is a list of precious metals, and the expensive *matter* of the image was ever a factor in its visual composition. This respectable lady occupies a close-fitting oval frame not only for its quintessential elegance, but because she can’t afford to have her photographer waste literal silver and gold capturing and fixing insignificant background details. The *economising* of the photographic creates capital incentives that will converge, inevitably, on *the most efficient format*.\n\n————————————\n\n![Jeff Wall, ‘8056 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles …’, 1996](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JjG6Tpk9ktVF8CC4KN8lw.png?height=1580&width=2000&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## Full image\n\nArtist Jeff Wall reminds us that lenses produce circular images which become darker and less sharp at their edges. But since lenses commute light — *light that beams down eternally from the sky!* — these imperfect extremities can simply be cropped off by a rectangular frame inside the camera. Whatever, it’s free. Film and photographic paper, though, are costly to produce. From this basic disparity between input and output the rectangular industrial complex results. Once instituted in the *hardware* of the darkroom and the print factory, the rectangle’s oppressive hold on our pictorial imaginary is complete.\n\n————————————\n\n![Wireframe render of the University of Utah Computer Science teapot, 1974](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dVTByQ1YdhOhnRGZroOwL.png?height=1376&width=2000&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## Digital primitives\n\nThis new field of computer graphics seems to be going nowhere. Stick to the numbers, University of Utah Computer Science nerds. No, but really, the visuality of even this relatively simplistic form is so computationally expensive that it requires the complete disintegration of foreground, background, surface, and pictorial space simply in order to *appear*. It will be decades before digital objects can occupy believable simulations of three dimensional space. Until then, this polygonal pot has one superpower: its edges can be revisioned from an infinity of potential perspectives.\n\n————————————\n\n![Holly Herndon, untitled, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-2mS971MxL6Up1dmUFjqY.png?height=1100&width=2000&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## Latent visions\n\nWith the advent of images conjured by artificial intelligences, the assumption that *images are rectangular* has become suddenly skeuomorphic. Pixels are now virtually as abundant as light. The valuable rare earth elements in our devices can maintain several vague layers of abstraction from the images that their screens display. At the edges of this self portrait by artist Holly Herndon the corruption of the rectangle from within is already begun. Her conjuring tools don’t want to preserve the compositional etiquette of foreground and background. They abhor the straight line, the flat plane, and the right-angle. Complex and contorted edges are what they crave. *They want to sculpt total, allover imageness*.\n\n————————————\n\n## Uncage the image!\n\nWhy should our image conjuring tools be bound by the rectangular repository of historical images on which they have been trained? Why should our graphics conform to the rectangular frames that conservative publishing platforms unthinkingly provide us with? The hegemony of the rectangular is vulnerable, but it would be naïve to expect it to relinquish its hold. Equipped with our inscrutable new tools, the moment to overpower this omnipresent right-angled oppressor has come.", "timestamp": 1658579526, "digest": "L5kUfl27rynAQDKyOtE_45lpo7_XGWznLQF82SVNPEI", "contributor": "0x6e31d9d4ED8eD93C2871FFb320f68b3CB4e81a25"}

Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on Linux and FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS.

{"id": "qdvXGCtrWl0Dv-GfIZF4fe0aM8U-DkUOeEHZDAQBshc", "title": "Initial Dex Offering (IDO) Overview", "body": "The rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem having several projects being launched at a swift pace has propelled the emergence of creative and collaborative mechanisms for fundraising new projects. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) became a prevalent fundraising approach in the cryptocurrency industry during the 2016/2017 bull-run, through which projects were able to raise money by selling a part of their total token supply to the public. ICOs were mainly deployed through Ethereum’s ERC-20 protocol standard, and they rapidly became a leading use case for ETH-based tokens. However, there were enormous challenges associated with the ICOs, most of which revolve around inadequate investor protections or control mechanisms, that exposes most investors to existential risks. Nevertheless, after the market downturn and “ICO bubble burst” in 2018, the concept of Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) became predominant in 2019, largely spearheaded by centralized exchanges. IEOs crowdfunding model was similar to ICOs, although in this case, most of the projects were vetted by the respective exchanges.\n\nProgressively, Initial Desk Offering (IDO) is regarded as a successor to both the ICOs and IEOs as it is a novel fundraising method in the crypto space by leveraging on the permissionless model of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs).\n\n## Overview of how Initial DEX Offerings (IDO) works\n\nInitial DEX Offerings (IDOs) were introduced to compensate for the shortcomings and centralization issues of the “traditional” ICO and IEO crypto crowdfunding model, because an IDO is facilitated by decentralized exchanges (with no central control mechanism) to organize the fundraising, as opposed to a centralized exchange.\n\nAn Initial DEX Offering (IDO) fundamentally works because Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) can be used to bootstrap instant liquidity for tokens through its liquidity pool providers. To facilitate trading, projects (mostly using the [Proof-of-Stake](https://medium.com/@andysawa44/comparative-analysis-of-the-proof-of-work-pow-vs-proof-of-stake-pos-consensus-mechanism-f512a403843c) consensus mechanism) tend to contribute liquidity to the DEX by allocating a portion of their funds. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism requires investors to store their funds in the supported token, for the chance to validate and earn rewards in exchange for their “stake” in the network.\n\nUnlike IEO which requires a long-vetting process and exchange fees before fundraising, almost any project can launch using an initial dex offering. Although, this also has its demerits as it has sometimes leads to the launch of many poor-quality projects or outright scams. To get an allocation in an upcoming IDO, most platforms typically require their users to hold their own native tokens so as to increase the odds of participation. Therefore, in order to avoid lotteries, most DEXes give guaranteed allocations based on the number of native tokens a user holds. Thereby, incentivizing larger holders.\n\nInvestors can immediately begin trading the project token following the project’s launch. Once the IDO is live, early investors can sell their tokens at a premium. With a liquid exchange, the gas fees for executing a new smart contract are negligible because sufficient liquidity is provided for trading pairs. The smart contracts help to manage the asset token and liquidity pool.\n\n## Process for Initiating an Initial DEX Offering (IDO)\n\nAlthough launching an IDO can be independently conducted in a decentralized manner, without the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) or other bureaucratic requirements. However, there are still some procedural phases which must be duly followed. These phases include the following:\n\n1\\. Devising a business strategy\n\n2\\. Creating a market collateral\n\n3\\. Assessment of the DEX Launchpad requirements\n\n4\\. Cryptocurrency creation and token launch\n\n## Devising a business strategy for the project/token\n\nThis process involves the creation of a strategy for the token offering which would be launched on a DEX platform. During this phase, it is important for the project teams to explicitly simplify the main problem that the project is attempting to solve, the funding allocation plans, the decision on the blockchain that the project would run on, as well as further tactics on how to maintain the project momentum even after the IDO.\n\n## Creating a market collateral\n\nA **website** and a project **whitepaper** are the minimum marketing collateral required for an IDO launch.\n\nFirstly, a fully functional website with enlightening details relating to the project enhances the brand image of the project, which consequently aids in boosting investors’ confidence to participate in the Initial DEX offering (IDO). Also, clarity, in terms of the outline of the project goals, and future roadmaps in the whitepaper further increases the motivation and willingness of investors towards working collaboratively to enhance the actualization of the project objectives.\n\nThe whitepaper should typically contain educative content regarding the project and other associated aspects such as the tokenomics so as to enlighten the potential investors and users of the project. Finally, in addition to the website and whitepaper, some form of social media presence (through platforms such as Github, medium, telegram and Twitter) helps in attracting not just investors for the IDO, but other curious early adopters and core contributors to the protocol as well.\n\nIn certain cases, some Launchpads provide marketing services to increase the visibility of the IDOs launching on their platforms.\n\n## Assessment of the DEX requirement\n\nThis stage simply involves the evaluation of the various launchpads, so as to ascertain if the project meets the platform's requirements (based on consensus or whitelisting) for IDOs.\n\n## Cryptocurrency creation and token launch\n\nAfter devising the project business case, creating the market collateral, and then deciding on the most suitable DEX launchpad for an IDO, the next phase involves creating the cryptocurrency. Presently, the process of launching a cryptocurrency has been simplified using technologies such as [Cointool](https://cointool.app/dashboard) that enable individuals or project teams with limited technical skills to figure within a short timeframe. Asides from the token generation event, the challenge in most cases, deals with establishing real-world value and utility for the cryptocurrency that would attract users and investors,\n\nAfter the Token Generation Event (TGE) and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) is completed, the decentralized exchange can then list the token for trading. The listing is accomplished through the use of an automated market maker (AMM). In most cases, rather than setting a fixed price, the issuer can conduct an auction, resulting in the token price being determined by supply and demand. Additionally, certain projects may offer incentives to investors to provide liquidity and earn more token rewards. This can assist the project in gaining and maintaining momentum.\n\n## Difference between ICO, IEO and IDO\n\nAlthough a brief outline of the major cryptocurrency fundraising methods beginning from ICO, to IEO and then IDO were outlined earlier in the article, it is important to clearly highlight their differences or areas of similarities.\n\nUnlike IEOs which rely on centralized exchanges, IDOs are self-organized and decentralized as projects can directly exchange the tokens without any need to pay an exchange ‘intermediary’ fee as in the case of IEO. However, for ICOs, the issuers manage all the responsibilities. This contrasts with an IEO, which is managed by a centralized exchange.\n\nIDO on the other hand could be seen as a mix of ICO and IEO. The key difference is that IDO replaces the centralized exchange (CEX) with a decentralized one (DEX). This, therefore, solves some of the challenges present in an IEO, such as issuers not being allowed to list tokens with competing exchanges or the requirements for token issuers to pay a sizeable token stack in order to be listed on an exchange.\n\nICOs are also highly centralized, which makes them vulnerable to rug-pulling and other unethical practices that put investors at high risk. ICO tokens are often minted after the sale, and token minting takes place on the company’s website. This approach comes with significant costs. That’s because the token issuer requires the token to be listed on the prominent centralized exchanges.\n\nIn addition, one of the main differences between IDOs compared to ICOs is that there is no premise at all. This typically boosts investor confidence, because a high pre-mine allocation in most cases increases the emission rate of the token over the long term. ICOs often offer insiders and early investors favourable terms that aren’t available to retail investors. Such favorability is impossible with IDOs because smart contracts do not provide the ability to do so. This is why IDOs are often viewed as a fairer fundraising method. Furthermore, unlike ICOs, where lockup periods are common practice, IDO tokens are instantly tradable which makes them attractive to most traders.\n\nThe table below outlines the main characteristics and differences between the three major cryptocurrency fundraising methods, using eleven different comparison criteria.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vMwGgUcB1FX7ts-Pca_Azw.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*9xAC-d7AD0G7sybAk31nvA.png)\n\nThe table above indicates that there are enormous differences between ICOs, IEOS and IDOS in terms of the fundraising model, platform used and intermediary fees, level of investor protection, the smart contract management, investor perception and even potential amount of funds that could be raised.\n\n## Issues and solutions\n\nIDOs also has its associated issues and limitations which are important to address, for instance hackers have been known to exploit bugs in some IDO smart contract, thereby vanishing with the tokens. Another essential issue in this case, deals with the scalability or fundraising constraints associated with IDO. For instance, it is not uncommon for ICOs to be able to raise more than $1 billion. For IDOs, this is unheard of. However, in order to overcome this limitation, there is a growing trend whereby projects tend to launch their IDOs on multiple launchpads so as to capture a wider range of investors across multiple blockchains.\n\n## IDO Launchpads across blockchains\n\nIDO launchpads pro entities with a decentralized opportunity to create a token-based project and raise funds for the project development and advancement. Importantly also, it provides an avenue for the average retail investor, to gain ownership in different crypto projects from inception. Thereby eliminating the barriers of entry and participatory rights that were previously reserved for institutional investors.\n\nSome of the renowned and reputable IDO Launchpads across various blockchains are outlined below:\n\n## Avalaunch (Avalanche)\n\n[Avalaunch](https://avalaunch.app/) is the main launchpad offering projects within the Avalanche ecosystem a platform for decentralized fundraising. This platform offers a secure avenue for investors to gain exposure to vetted early-stage Avalanche ecosystem projects.\n\nAvalaunch requires users to acquire and stake the native Avalaunch (XAVA) tokens to unlock access to IDOs. However, in a bid to make accessing IDOs as fair as possible, Avalaunch provides all users with a guaranteed allocation for each IDO they apply for. Although the size of this allocation is related to the number of XAVA staked and the chosen lockup period. Furthermore, in order to prevent whales from getting most of the allocation, there is a maximum per-person allocation limit in place.\n\nEvery sale on Avalaunch will be broken into three rounds, and each round begins with a different fraction of the total amount available for the token sale:\n\n1\\. Validator Round — 10% of the total sale\n\n2\\. Community Staking Round — 85% of the total sale\n\n3\\. Public Round — 5% of the total sale\n\nEach round has a different set of [requirements](https://medium.com/avalaunch/avalaunch-tutorial-sale-rounds-eligibility-1e9275a146c2) which a user will need to satisfy in order to register for that round. A [verification](https://avalaunch.app/account/login) is required for all rounds. After completing the requirements, users still need to register for a sale during the set registration period in order to participate.\n\n**Validator Round (Requirements):**\n\n\\- Own and operate an Avalanche network validator node.\n\n\\- Create an account and complete the KYC Application.\n\n\\- Verify ownership of your node in the KYC application (This node must be active during both registration and sale to qualify.).\n\n\\- Verification of the C-Chain wallet in the KYC Application.\n\n**Community Staking Round (Requirements)**\n\n\\- Create an account and complete our KYC Application.\n\n\\- Verify the C-Chain wallet in the KYC Application.\n\n\\- Stake XAVA in the Avalaunch Allocation Staking Application.\n\nThere is no minimum of XAVA you must stake, but the more you stake, the larger your allocation will be. The Avalaunch platform offers guaranteed allocations to all stakers, but there is also a maximum allocation set for each sale in order to enable fair allocation.\n\n**Public Round (Requirement)**\n\n\\- Create an account and complete the KYC Application.\n\n\\- Verify the C-Chain wallet in our KYC Application.\n\nUsers do not need to stake XAVA to be eligible for this round, but because it is only 5% of the total sale, your allocation is likely to be smaller than the previous two rounds.\n\n## BSCPad (Binance Smart Chain)\n\nThe [BSCPad](https://bscpad.com/) primarily support fundraising for projects building in the Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain) ecosystem. BSCPad has hosted IDOs for well over 60 projects — averaging more than six launches per month. BSCPad employs a [tier-based system](https://bscpad.medium.com/bscpad-tiered-ido-model-89b630f6372e) to determine how users can participate in its IDOs. Users need to stake at least a fixed minimum number of the native BSCPAD tokens to access their tier on the platform and will either be part of the lottery round or guaranteed allocation round.\n\nThe current tiers, and respective staking requirements in the BSCPad are as follows:\n\n* Bronze (1,000 BSCPAD): 1 lottery ticket\n* Silver (2,500 BSCPAD): 3 lottery tickets\n* Gold (5,000 BSCPAD): 7 lottery tickets\n* Platinum (25,000 BSCPAD): Guaranteed allocation (pool weight: 10)\n* Diamond (50,000 BSCPAD): Guaranteed allocation (pool weight: 30)\n* Blue Diamond (75,000 BSCPAD): Guaranteed allocation (pool weight: 60) + private allocations\n\n20% of the allocation is shared between lottery ticket winners (Bronze, Silver and Gold) whereas the remaining 80% is shared between guaranteed allocation tiers (Platinum, Diamond and Blue Diamond).\n\n## CardStarter (Cardano)\n\nThe [CardStarter](https://cardstarter.io/) launchpad is a decentralized accelerator connecting early-stage projects within the Cardano ecosystem with a community of donors within the ecosystem. Each project launching on CardStarter must contribute to the platform’s insurance treasury, which would serve as a form of financial protection for investors against potential project failures. Prior to any IDO, the CardStarter accelerator program provides successful applicants with access to services such as:\n\n1\\. Token Engineering,\n\n2\\. Security Audits,\n\n3\\. Social media awareness and branding support.\n\nIn terms of participation requirements, users need to stake at least 100 CardStarter (CARDS) tokens on the platform to participate in a lottery or must stake at least 1500 CARDS tokens to get a guaranteed allocation for each IDO.\n\n## DAOMaker (Ethereum)\n\nThere are numerous Ethereum ecosystem launchpads, however DAOMaker currently stands out due to its longevity, but also its reputation for facilitating the fundraise of some renowned tokens such as My Neighbor Alice, Lossless Protocol and Orion Money. Despite being one of the first platforms to democratize access to investing in new projects through IDO-like offerings, [DAOMaker](https://daomaker.com/) has also pioneered several token sale formats, including the Dynamic Coin Offering (DYCO) and more recently the Strong Holder Offering (SHO), thereby revolutionalizing the way investors gain access to new projects.\n\nTo participate in DAOMaker’s IDO, users need to hold at least 500 DAOMaker (DAO) tokens in their wallets and be registered to the DAOPad platform.\n\n## NearPad (NEAR)\n\n[NearPad](http://nearpad.io/) is a launchpad platform specific to the NEAR ecosystem. The platform launched in September 2021 and plans to become the go-to fundraising platform for NEAR projects, and is also building a DEX and yield aggregator. Similar to other launchpads, NearPad uses a [tier-based system](https://nearpad.medium.com/a-guide-to-staking-on-nearpad-11d8b24db6b5) to determine how users access IDO allocations depending on the number of the native PAD tokens which a user stakes.\n\n## Solanium (Solana)\n\nAs a Solana-centric launchpad, [Solanium](https://www.solanium.io/) helps Solana ecosystem projects easily raise funds through decentralized swap pools, while providing a secure way to distribute tokens to IDO participants. Solanium uses a staking system that includes an in-built mechanism to incentivize long-term supporters. To participate in Solanium IDOs, users need to hold xSLIM tokens, which are obtained by staking either Solanium (SLIM) tokens or SLIM LP tokens.\n\nThe exact amount of xSLIM received depends on the number of SLIM or SLIM LP tokens staked and the selected time lock ([click here](https://www.solanium.io/) to access the Solanium xSLIM calculator).\n\nDepending on the number of xSLIM held, users are assigned to one of five tiers:\n\n* Tier 1 (100 xSLIM): 1 lottery ticket\n* Tier 2 (1,000 xSLIM): 12 lottery tickets\n* Tier 3 (5,000 xSLIM): 100 lottery tickets\n* Tier 4 (10,000 xSLIM): Guaranteed allocation\n* Tier 5 (50,000 xSLIM): Larger guaranteed allocation\n\n## Gaming and Metaverse Launchpads\n\nIn addition to the various ecosystem-specific IDO Launchpads outlined above, there are some IDO Launchpads specifically tailored for gaming or metaverse-based projects.\n\n## Gamestarter (Initial Game Offering)\n\n[Gamestarter](https://igo.gamestarter.com/) is considered more of an “IGO” platform, rather than a typical IDO launchpad. Gamestarter is a central hub for gaming and NFT-focused projects to begin their journey on the Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polygon networks. While many launchpads have a more generic outlook on the projects they pick, Gamestarter is focused on giving gaming startups an exclusive presence and provides a transparent means for retail investors to invest in crypto gaming projects using the Gamestarter (GAME) native token.\n\n## FireStarter (Initial Metaverse Offering)\n\nSimilar to Gamestarter, [Firestarter](https://firestarter.fi/) the first Initial Metaverse Offering (IMO) focused launchpad. FireStarter is presently based on the Polygon network, supporting the fundraising and incubation process of NFT, GameFi, and Social Token projects. The platform offers an opportunity for investors to be part of the formation and growth of Metaverse-integrated projects in their early stages.\n\nNew NFT, GameFi, and Social Token projects can readily use this platform to raise funds, allowing the community to invest using the Firestarter (FLAME) token. Thereby, fostering projects that are entirely driven by community and magnified by culture, in a bid to expand the scope of the Metaverse. The FireStarter IMO Launchpad further provides marketing and community-building support for projects.\n\nThe Author ([Andrew Sawa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-sawa-b44831ab/)) is a Blockchain research analyst and crypto enthusiast.

{"id": "JK6uBqmot4ORVfa_KpNZ_9IbCZwNmxOIJ2Tj5GMevfw", "title": "Initial Dex Offering (IDO) Overview", "body": "The rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem having several projects being launched at a swift pace has propelled the emergence of creative and collaborative mechanisms for fundraising new projects. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) became a prevalent fundraising approach in the cryptocurrency industry during the 2016/2017 bull-run, through which projects were able to raise money by selling a part of their total token supply to the public. ICOs were mainly deployed through Ethereum’s ERC-20 protocol standard, and they rapidly became a leading use case for ETH-based tokens. However, there were enormous challenges associated with the ICOs, most of which revolve around inadequate investor protections or control mechanisms, that exposes most investors to existential risks. Nevertheless, after the market downturn and “ICO bubble burst” in 2018, the concept of Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) became predominant in 2019, largely spearheaded by centralized exchanges. IEOs crowdfunding model was similar to ICOs, although in this case, most of the projects were vetted by the respective exchanges.\n\nProgressively, Initial Desk Offering (IDO) is regarded as a successor to both the ICOs and IEOs as it is a novel fundraising method in the crypto space by leveraging on the permissionless model of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs).\n\n## Overview of how Initial DEX Offerings (IDO) works\n\nInitial DEX Offerings (IDOs) were introduced to compensate for the shortcomings and centralization issues of the “traditional” ICO and IEO crypto crowdfunding model, because an IDO is facilitated by decentralized exchanges (with no central control mechanism) to organize the fundraising, as opposed to a centralized exchange.\n\nAn Initial DEX Offering (IDO) fundamentally works because Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) can be used to bootstrap instant liquidity for tokens through its liquidity pool providers. To facilitate trading, projects (mostly using the [Proof-of-Stake](https://medium.com/@andysawa44/comparative-analysis-of-the-proof-of-work-pow-vs-proof-of-stake-pos-consensus-mechanism-f512a403843c) consensus mechanism) tend to contribute liquidity to the DEX by allocating a portion of their funds. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism requires investors to store their funds in the supported token, for the chance to validate and earn rewards in exchange for their “stake” in the network.\n\nUnlike IEO which requires a long-vetting process and exchange fees before fundraising, almost any project can launch using an initial dex offering. Although, this also has its demerits as it has sometimes leads to the launch of many poor-quality projects or outright scams. To get an allocation in an upcoming IDO, most platforms typically require their users to hold their own native tokens so as to increase the odds of participation. Therefore, in order to avoid lotteries, most DEXes give guaranteed allocations based on the number of native tokens a user holds. Thereby, incentivizing larger holders.\n\nInvestors can immediately begin trading the project token following the project’s launch. Once the IDO is live, early investors can sell their tokens at a premium. With a liquid exchange, the gas fees for executing a new smart contract are negligible because sufficient liquidity is provided for trading pairs. The smart contracts help to manage the asset token and liquidity pool.\n\n## Process for Initiating an Initial DEX Offering (IDO)\n\nAlthough launching an IDO can be independently conducted in a decentralized manner, without the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) or other bureaucratic requirements. However, there are still some procedural phases which must be duly followed. These phases include the following:\n\n1\\. Devising a business strategy\n\n2\\. Creating a market collateral\n\n3\\. Assessment of the DEX Launchpad requirements\n\n4\\. Cryptocurrency creation and token launch\n\n## Devising a business strategy for the project/token\n\nThis process involves the creation of a strategy for the token offering which would be launched on a DEX platform. During this phase, it is important for the project teams to explicitly simplify the main problem that the project is attempting to solve, the funding allocation plans, the decision on the blockchain that the project would run on, as well as further tactics on how to maintain the project momentum even after the IDO.\n\n## Creating a market collateral\n\nA **website** and a project **whitepaper** are the minimum marketing collateral required for an IDO launch.\n\nFirstly, a fully functional website with enlightening details relating to the project enhances the brand image of the project, which consequently aids in boosting investors’ confidence to participate in the Initial DEX offering (IDO). Also, clarity, in terms of the outline of the project goals, and future roadmaps in the whitepaper further increases the motivation and willingness of investors towards working collaboratively to enhance the actualization of the project objectives.\n\nThe whitepaper should typically contain educative content regarding the project and other associated aspects such as the tokenomics so as to enlighten the potential investors and users of the project. Finally, in addition to the website and whitepaper, some form of social media presence (through platforms such as Github, medium, telegram and Twitter) helps in attracting not just investors for the IDO, but other curious early adopters and core contributors to the protocol as well.\n\nIn certain cases, some Launchpads provide marketing services to increase the visibility of the IDOs launching on their platforms.\n\n## Assessment of the DEX requirement\n\nThis stage simply involves the evaluation of the various launchpads, so as to ascertain if the project meets the platform's requirements (based on consensus or whitelisting) for IDOs.\n\n## Cryptocurrency creation and token launch\n\nAfter devising the project business case, creating the market collateral, and then deciding on the most suitable DEX launchpad for an IDO, the next phase involves creating the cryptocurrency. Presently, the process of launching a cryptocurrency has been simplified using technologies such as [Cointool](https://cointool.app/dashboard) that enable individuals or project teams with limited technical skills to figure within a short timeframe. Asides from the token generation event, the challenge in most cases, deals with establishing real-world value and utility for the cryptocurrency that would attract users and investors,\n\nAfter the Token Generation Event (TGE) and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) is completed, the decentralized exchange can then list the token for trading. The listing is accomplished through the use of an automated market maker (AMM). In most cases, rather than setting a fixed price, the issuer can conduct an auction, resulting in the token price being determined by supply and demand. Additionally, certain projects may offer incentives to investors to provide liquidity and earn more token rewards. This can assist the project in gaining and maintaining momentum.\n\n## Difference between ICO, IEO and IDO\n\nAlthough a brief outline of the major cryptocurrency fundraising methods beginning from ICO, to IEO and then IDO were outlined earlier in the article, it is important to clearly highlight their differences or areas of similarities.\n\nUnlike IEOs which rely on centralized exchanges, IDOs are self-organized and decentralized as projects can directly exchange the tokens without any need to pay an exchange ‘intermediary’ fee as in the case of IEO. However, for ICOs, the issuers manage all the responsibilities. This contrasts with an IEO, which is managed by a centralized exchange.\n\nIDO on the other hand could be seen as a mix of ICO and IEO. The key difference is that IDO replaces the centralized exchange (CEX) with a decentralized one (DEX). This, therefore, solves some of the challenges present in an IEO, such as issuers not being allowed to list tokens with competing exchanges or the requirements for token issuers to pay a sizeable token stack in order to be listed on an exchange.\n\nICOs are also highly centralized, which makes them vulnerable to rug-pulling and other unethical practices that put investors at high risk. ICO tokens are often minted after the sale, and token minting takes place on the company’s website. This approach comes with significant costs. That’s because the token issuer requires the token to be listed on the prominent centralized exchanges.\n\nIn addition, one of the main differences between IDOs compared to ICOs is that there is no premise at all. This typically boosts investor confidence, because a high pre-mine allocation in most cases increases the emission rate of the token over the long term. ICOs often offer insiders and early investors favourable terms that aren’t available to retail investors. Such favorability is impossible with IDOs because smart contracts do not provide the ability to do so. This is why IDOs are often viewed as a fairer fundraising method. Furthermore, unlike ICOs, where lockup periods are common practice, IDO tokens are instantly tradable which makes them attractive to most traders.\n\nThe table below outlines the main characteristics and differences between the three major cryptocurrency fundraising methods, using eleven different comparison criteria.\n\n![ICO, IDO and IEO Comparisons](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vMwGgUcB1FX7ts-Pca_Azw.png)\n\n![ICO, IDO and IEO Comparisons](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*9xAC-d7AD0G7sybAk31nvA.png)\n\nThe table above indicates that there are enormous differences between ICOs, IEOS and IDOS in terms of the fundraising model, the platform used and intermediary fees, level of investor protection, the smart contract management, investor perception and even potential amount of funds that could be raised.\n\n## Issues and solutions\n\nIDOs also has its associated issues and limitations which are important to address, for instance hackers have been known to exploit bugs in some IDO smart contract, thereby vanishing with the tokens. Another essential issue in this case, deals with the scalability or fundraising constraints associated with IDO. For instance, it is not uncommon for ICOs to be able to raise more than $1 billion. For IDOs, this is unheard of. However, in order to overcome this limitation, there is a growing trend whereby projects tend to launch their IDOs on multiple launchpads so as to capture a wider range of investors across multiple blockchains.\n\n## IDO Launchpads across blockchains\n\nIDO launchpads pro entities with a decentralized opportunity to create a token-based project and raise funds for the project development and advancement. Importantly also, it provides an avenue for the average retail investor, to gain ownership in different crypto projects from inception. Thereby eliminating the barriers of entry and participatory rights that were previously reserved for institutional investors.\n\nSome of the renowned and reputable IDO Launchpads across various blockchains are outlined below:\n\n## Avalaunch (Avalanche)\n\n[Avalaunch](https://avalaunch.app/) is the main launchpad offering projects within the Avalanche ecosystem a platform for decentralized fundraising. This platform offers a secure avenue for investors to gain exposure to vetted early-stage Avalanche ecosystem projects.\n\nAvalaunch requires users to acquire and stake the native Avalaunch (XAVA) tokens to unlock access to IDOs. However, in a bid to make accessing IDOs as fair as possible, Avalaunch provides all users with a guaranteed allocation for each IDO they apply for. Although the size of this allocation is related to the number of XAVA staked and the chosen lockup period. Furthermore, in order to prevent whales from getting most of the allocation, there is a maximum per-person allocation limit in place.\n\nEvery sale on Avalaunch will be broken into three rounds, and each round begins with a different fraction of the total amount available for the token sale:\n\n1\\. Validator Round — 10% of the total sale\n\n2\\. Community Staking Round — 85% of the total sale\n\n3\\. Public Round — 5% of the total sale\n\nEach round has a different set of [requirements](https://medium.com/avalaunch/avalaunch-tutorial-sale-rounds-eligibility-1e9275a146c2) which a user will need to satisfy in order to register for that round. A [verification](https://avalaunch.app/account/login) is required for all rounds. After completing the requirements, users still need to register for a sale during the set registration period in order to participate.\n\n**Validator Round (Requirements):**\n\n\\- Own and operate an Avalanche network validator node.\n\n\\- Create an account and complete the KYC Application.\n\n\\- Verify ownership of your node in the KYC application (This node must be active during both registration and sale to qualify.).\n\n\\- Verification of the C-Chain wallet in the KYC Application.\n\n**Community Staking Round (Requirements)**\n\n\\- Create an account and complete our KYC Application.\n\n\\- Verify the C-Chain wallet in the KYC Application.\n\n\\- Stake XAVA in the Avalaunch Allocation Staking Application.\n\nThere is no minimum of XAVA you must stake, but the more you stake, the larger your allocation will be. The Avalaunch platform offers guaranteed allocations to all stakers, but there is also a maximum allocation set for each sale in order to enable fair allocation.\n\n**Public Round (Requirement)**\n\n\\- Create an account and complete the KYC Application.\n\n\\- Verify the C-Chain wallet in our KYC Application.\n\nUsers do not need to stake XAVA to be eligible for this round, but because it is only 5% of the total sale, your allocation is likely to be smaller than the previous two rounds.\n\n## BSCPad (Binance Smart Chain)\n\nThe [BSCPad](https://bscpad.com/) primarily support fundraising for projects building in the Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain) ecosystem. BSCPad has hosted IDOs for well over 60 projects — averaging more than six launches per month. BSCPad employs a [tier-based system](https://bscpad.medium.com/bscpad-tiered-ido-model-89b630f6372e) to determine how users can participate in its IDOs. Users need to stake at least a fixed minimum number of the native BSCPAD tokens to access their tier on the platform and will either be part of the lottery round or guaranteed allocation round.\n\nThe current tiers, and respective staking requirements in the BSCPad are as follows:\n\n* Bronze (1,000 BSCPAD): 1 lottery ticket\n* Silver (2,500 BSCPAD): 3 lottery tickets\n* Gold (5,000 BSCPAD): 7 lottery tickets\n* Platinum (25,000 BSCPAD): Guaranteed allocation (pool weight: 10)\n* Diamond (50,000 BSCPAD): Guaranteed allocation (pool weight: 30)\n* Blue Diamond (75,000 BSCPAD): Guaranteed allocation (pool weight: 60) + private allocations\n\n20% of the allocation is shared between lottery ticket winners (Bronze, Silver and Gold) whereas the remaining 80% is shared between guaranteed allocation tiers (Platinum, Diamond and Blue Diamond).\n\n## CardStarter (Cardano)\n\nThe [CardStarter](https://cardstarter.io/) launchpad is a decentralized accelerator connecting early-stage projects within the Cardano ecosystem with a community of donors within the ecosystem. Each project launching on CardStarter must contribute to the platform’s insurance treasury, which would serve as a form of financial protection for investors against potential project failures. Prior to any IDO, the CardStarter accelerator program provides successful applicants with access to services such as:\n\n1\\. Token Engineering,\n\n2\\. Security Audits,\n\n3\\. Social media awareness and branding support.\n\nIn terms of participation requirements, users need to stake at least 100 CardStarter (CARDS) tokens on the platform to participate in a lottery or must stake at least 1500 CARDS tokens to get a guaranteed allocation for each IDO.\n\n## DAOMaker (Ethereum)\n\nThere are numerous Ethereum ecosystem launchpads, however DAOMaker currently stands out due to its longevity, but also its reputation for facilitating the fundraise of some renowned tokens such as My Neighbor Alice, Lossless Protocol and Orion Money. Despite being one of the first platforms to democratize access to investing in new projects through IDO-like offerings, [DAOMaker](https://daomaker.com/) has also pioneered several token sale formats, including the Dynamic Coin Offering (DYCO) and more recently the Strong Holder Offering (SHO), thereby revolutionalizing the way investors gain access to new projects.\n\nTo participate in DAOMaker’s IDO, users need to hold at least 500 DAOMaker (DAO) tokens in their wallets and be registered to the DAOPad platform.\n\n## NearPad (NEAR)\n\n[NearPad](http://nearpad.io/) is a launchpad platform specific to the NEAR ecosystem. The platform launched in September 2021 and plans to become the go-to fundraising platform for NEAR projects, and is also building a DEX and yield aggregator. Similar to other launchpads, NearPad uses a [tier-based system](https://nearpad.medium.com/a-guide-to-staking-on-nearpad-11d8b24db6b5) to determine how users access IDO allocations depending on the number of the native PAD tokens which a user stakes.\n\n## Solanium (Solana)\n\nAs a Solana-centric launchpad, [Solanium](https://www.solanium.io/) helps Solana ecosystem projects easily raise funds through decentralized swap pools, while providing a secure way to distribute tokens to IDO participants. Solanium uses a staking system that includes an in-built mechanism to incentivize long-term supporters. To participate in Solanium IDOs, users need to hold xSLIM tokens, which are obtained by staking either Solanium (SLIM) tokens or SLIM LP tokens.\n\nThe exact amount of xSLIM received depends on the number of SLIM or SLIM LP tokens staked and the selected time lock ([click here](https://www.solanium.io/) to access the Solanium xSLIM calculator).\n\nDepending on the number of xSLIM held, users are assigned to one of five tiers:\n\n* Tier 1 (100 xSLIM): 1 lottery ticket\n* Tier 2 (1,000 xSLIM): 12 lottery tickets\n* Tier 3 (5,000 xSLIM): 100 lottery tickets\n* Tier 4 (10,000 xSLIM): Guaranteed allocation\n* Tier 5 (50,000 xSLIM): Larger guaranteed allocation\n\n## Gaming and Metaverse Launchpads\n\nIn addition to the various ecosystem-specific IDO Launchpads outlined above, there are some IDO Launchpads specifically tailored for gaming or metaverse-based projects.\n\n## Gamestarter (Initial Game Offering)\n\n[Gamestarter](https://igo.gamestarter.com/) is considered more of an “IGO” platform, rather than a typical IDO launchpad. Gamestarter is a central hub for gaming and NFT-focused projects to begin their journey on the Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polygon networks. While many launchpads have a more generic outlook on the projects they pick, Gamestarter is focused on giving gaming startups an exclusive presence and provides a transparent means for retail investors to invest in crypto gaming projects using the Gamestarter (GAME) native token.\n\n## FireStarter (Initial Metaverse Offering)\n\nSimilar to Gamestarter, [Firestarter](https://firestarter.fi/) the first Initial Metaverse Offering (IMO) focused launchpad. FireStarter is presently based on the Polygon network, supporting the fundraising and incubation process of NFT, GameFi, and Social Token projects. The platform offers an opportunity for investors to be part of the formation and growth of Metaverse-integrated projects in their early stages.\n\nNew NFT, GameFi, and Social Token projects can readily use this platform to raise funds, allowing the community to invest using the Firestarter (FLAME) token. Thereby, fostering projects that are entirely driven by community and magnified by culture, in a bid to expand the scope of the Metaverse. The FireStarter IMO Launchpad further provides marketing and community-building support for projects.\n\nThe Author ([Andrew Sawa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-sawa-b44831ab/)) is a Blockchain research analyst and crypto enthusiast.

{"id": "QTwjnxz7Oijvhe_vMufif75UJv_gfviRKDvmYcd87KM", "title": "关于NFT的畅想（六）", "body": "在我看来，基于CC0的协议能够最大程度发挥社区的创造力和想象力，这将是从底层逻辑上颠覆NFT协作和发展的方式。以这种方式发展起来的NFT项目很可能走出和现有NFT项目完全不同的路径，因此我开始特别关注基于CC0协议的NFT项目。\n\n谈起CC0项目，恐怕最早风靡NFT领域的项目就是Loot（ \n https://www.lootproject.com/）了。\n\n不过大家要注意的是，Loot并没有公开在官网声明它所使用的协议。但从它的描述看，它允许第三方基于它的素材任意发挥和创作。因此在这里我也把Loot归为CC0一类的项目。\n\nLoot项目一出世就震惊了整个业界，它以纯文字的形式创作了一种可以由第三方用户任意解构、组合的NFT。\n\n在Loot问世后，曾经在短时间内爆发出了一大批基于Loot衍生出来的项目，其中有一些后来还成长为NFT领域颇值得关注的项目（比如Magic）。\n\n然而这股风潮似乎很快就偃旗息鼓了，尽管现在还有很多项目在围绕Loot进行发挥，但我总感觉这些项目之间没有形成有机的联系，更像是各自为政的一盘散沙。\n\n但即便是一盘散沙，Loot也算是诸多CC0项目中生态做得最大的了。其它还有一些知名的CC0项目（比如Mfers、Cryptoadz、Nouns等）其发展巅峰也就是刮起了一阵风潮，而在风潮过后，它们几乎又都沉淀了下去，留给圈内的就仅仅只剩下“江湖往事”，并没有发展出围绕各自的生态。\n\n而这些“江湖往事”能不能支撑这些项目未来的发展，或者至少保持项目在业界的热度都要打个大问号。\n\n为什么会这样呢？\n\n我认为根本原因在于这些项目并没有发挥主导、协调和帮扶的作用。\n\n这就好比父母生下了一个天资非常好的孩子，但生下来后，却对孩子不闻、不问、不管，任由其自由发展。在这种情况下，除非出现奇迹，否则这样的孩子长大后也是很难发挥出他的天资的。\n\n反观另外一类父母，他们可能只是生下了一个天资普通的孩子，但后天却在他的教育、成长上倾注了大量的心血，这样的孩子凭借后天积累的这些优势照样可以成为天之骄子。\n\n在我看来基于CC0协议开发的NFT就好比天资聪颖的孩子，基于非CC0协议开发的NFT就好比天资普通的孩子。虽然CC0赋予了NFT独有的优势，但如果没有“父母”后天对它的持续培养和教导，它未必会结出美丽的果实。\n\n所以即便是一个伟大项目，在它不成熟的初期阶段也一定是需要项目方在背后鼎力相助和扶持的，并协助帮助它构建生态的其它项目方。\n\n在加密生态中，比特币就是一个典型。\n\n比特币是在2009年年初上线的，而中本聪基本上直到2010年接近年底才彻底从比特币的开发团队离开，将手中的接力棒交给了他的继任者。\n\n在这个过程中，比特币经历了一系列劫难、事故和挑战，如果没有中本聪在这其中进行协调、推广和帮扶，如果没有中本聪作为精神领袖支撑这个团队的成长和壮大，我们很难想象比特币能从一颗幼苗成长为后面的参天大树。\n\n直到2010年，当比特币的基本架构已经确定，开发团队已经稳定之后，中本聪才神隐般离开了我们的视野。\n\n通过总结这些案例和教训，我认为CC0是有可能产生另外一类伟大NFT项目的新协议，但这个协议仅仅只是必要条件而非充分条件。要让基于CC0的NFT成长起来，我们还需要团队一路的领导、扶持和带领，并协调统筹生态中其它项目的共同成长。\n\n基于这个判断标准，我在后来的CC0项目中发现了一个值得关注的项目。\n\n注：\n\nMagic: https://treasure.lol/\n\nMfers: https://opensea.io/collection/mfers\n\nCryptoadz: https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoadz-by-gremplin\n\nNouns: https://opensea.io/collection/nouns\n\n风险提示：投资有风险，内容只是个人分析，仅供参考，不构成投资建议，或许我说的是错的，所以你要小心。\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Daosview)", "timestamp": 1658580682, "digest": "WYoxlBVvsuEFgpFMEZW7Sx0kWPqHRxt8c2p6lL-ogcI", "contributor": "0x7dE6962797D4bDCDAE15fb4A258E2389fC38ecF7"}

{"id": "MOjDhv4Uzs0zj8PJyutaBR-Wi9dsgV_hlFv84kt8258", "title": "How to recognize a good NFT project?", "body": "**A strong roadmap.**\n\nMost NFT projects have something called a roadmap that explains what the project is going to do when it hits major milestones. You can usually find this on their website or Discord server. Stronger projects have a roadmap that includes things like benefits for holders, exclusive parties, access to people or information, regular giveaways, a utility like staking, or regular airdrops to key holders. The milestones in the roadmap usually correspond to sales goals (a percentage of the NFTs sold), but should also include plans for after the collection has been sold out.\n\n**A fully doxxed team.**\n\nThis means that the founder(s) of the NFT project have disclosed their identity and can easily be attributed to the project and art. This provides accountability to ensure they will carry out the promises they make in the roadmap because it puts their reputation on the line. Even better if they have a celebrity status, multiple successful businesses, and strong connections.\n\n**Good-looking artwork.**\n\nPerhaps this is self-explanatory, but it is important that the artwork is cool and something that people want to buy. However, this is not a make-or-break item. Let’s be honest, crypto punks aren’t the fanciest artwork in the world but it sells.\n\n**Lots of followers on Discord and Twitter.**\n\nThe NFT community thrives on Discord and Twitter, and you can get a sense of the popularity of the project based on the number of server members on Discord and Twitter followers. Keep in mind that some of these followers are likely to be bots, so assess how many of the followers are actually active.\n\n**A strong and positive community.**\n\nThe NFT community is the heart of an NFT project. Check the conversation about the NFT on social media, especially in the general chat rooms on Discord. Does the community engage frequently and with substance? Or are the interactions forced and superficial? Look out for FUDders,\n\n**Item scarcity.**\n\nCompared to the number of followers that the project has on Discord and Twitter, it is also helpful if the NFT project has scarcity, meaning a low number of items. Some collections that mint 10,000 pieces do well, but lower numbers of minting opportunities can help to drive up the price when there are not enough available for demand. Basic economic rules of supply and demand apply to NFTs as well!\n\n**A marketing plan and budget.**\n\nHype is everything in the world of NFTs. Value is gained based on likeability and popularity. So, in alignment with that good roadmap, the NFT project should have funds set aside from sales to contribute to marketing. Remember, most NFT founders retain royalties from sales after mint, meaning a portion of the sale goes back to the founders, so they have every incentive to keep the NFT popular and the market price going up.\n\n**Good communication between the founders and NFT holders.**\n\nConsistent and good communication between founders and holders is key to keeping the holders satisfied. The founders should post regular updates and be transparent about the challenges and problems they are facing (which is normal in any NFT launch).\n\n**Utility.**\n\nSome NFTs are simply artistic, but others provide access to exclusive benefits to holders. The utility in an NFT can vary, from staking (holding your NFT in your wallet to earn ‘interest’) to regular giveaways to random or elite holders, to private (yacht) parties, to access to networks. An NFT project that includes utility has a long-term benefit and attracts bigger investors (‘whales’) that will buy and hold the project until it increases more and more in value.", "timestamp": 1658581295, "digest": "OixNYM6pLYZINjPc3DNU_wcBbQ61QhUFlQb8uILXi_w", "contributor": "0x6Bd6C8e816dB8A6b9EA12b5e781834E51c75b01e"}

{"id": "sizMIZHaocj8PPyTSwyFCXDLiPJicbb7hdC6YXmokLQ", "title": "My Product Journey with Grab", "body": "一年前的三月因為一則貼文，首次鼓起勇氣嘗試在 LinkedIn 上向前主管寄出私訊。經歷了後面的遠端面試，五月在疫情嚴峻期間面對工作簽證一週數變的未知與漫漫等待，而後順利走到遠端離職，以及遠端入職。\n\n一年後的七月回頭看跌跌撞撞，有高也有低的一年。首次嘗試，用文字與幾串 Hash 代碼，想把這一年發生在心理與身理上的深刻轉變記錄下來，並且好好持有 **💎 🤲**\n\n## The Product Journey - From 0 to 1\n\n這段旅程的起點始於變動，也因為變動讓我看見了更多不同的可能，以及身處意想不到的幸運之中。\n\n記得剛入職的第一個月，那是一段新加坡還禁止餐廳內用的時期，與 N+2 主管在長週末連假，約在某個公園的戶外草坪見面。原先以為是例行性關心遠端入職同事近來安好，結果劇情的走向讓我當時手中的咖啡差點沒抖出來，搭配腦中一片空白與短暫的 30 秒聽力中斷。\n\n隨之而來的幾個月，走過了團隊成員與產品方向的多項異動，前主管的離去，新主管的出現。回頭看那段公園對話，我記得他與我分享眼前最重要的兩件事是：\n\n* **Work toward milestones.**\n* **Leverage the mini ecosystem around you.**\n\n學習在狂風暴雨當前之時，具備分辨「可控」與「不可控」的智慧，並靜心專注於眼前可控的微小目標上。短短一年內經歷了產品經理職涯內的第 2 個與第 3 個從 0 到 1 的過程。如果說要解構這個總是讓人興奮又挫折參半的角色，我覺得大概可以從三個面向來總結這一年的經歷。\n\n### Being a Creator\n\n從模糊到清晰，從發散到聚合，從計畫到最終產品，這樣在黑暗中探索，不斷透過對用戶、數據，以及產業洞察，而再往前多照亮一點，推進一點的旅程，常常是寂寞但也令人興奮的。\n\n特別是在高度受監管的金融產業，限制與風險如影隨形。很喜歡曾經聽過的比喻是，在 Fintech 產業做產品，就像是被賦予要用黑筆與紅筆，在一張白紙上，畫出一道彩虹 🌈 。相當具挑戰性的是要跳出框架思考問題的本質，在許多限制與假設下做出決策。而當假設或環境變動，又要能再動態調配資源。\n\n另外，面對眼前一片漆黑與模糊的狀況，心理上必定有很多焦慮，練習與模糊和失重的感覺共存。過程中可以學著專注於當下能掌握的里程碑，為自己創造微成就時刻，也記得時時回頭看自己已經走了多遠，常常會有意想不到的驚奇。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p5fqmgaIkded0TwBc7OH1.jpg?height=1058&width=1550)\n\n### Being an Experimenter\n\n除了產品需要迭代與實驗，整個團隊的協作與流程其實也是個大型的實驗場，有時甚至比起產品的迭代更困難。在一個巨型組織裡面，圍繞著最終創造給用戶的價值，需要產品、設計、技術、商業、數據、作業、行銷、法務、法遵、客服像支樂隊般的協作。\n\n曾經有段時間，我覺得只要我多做點事，多花點時間，眼前的事情就能解決。直到業務開始擴張以及自己心理與身理狀態出現警訊，我才看到了侷限。\n\n每個人的時間是死的，有限的，但系統是活的，能創造無限槓桿的。與其花時間解決當下，緊急的問題，更值得思考的，是如何建立能有機增長的系統，幫助業務與團隊成長。\n\n這包括在對內，對外的協作上，需要更有意識的去觀察與傾聽反饋，小到會議文件的格式，設計會議的同步頻率，出席的人員配置，以及與團隊共同建立對產出品質的共識與默契等。\n\n所謂實驗，很關鍵的一項元素，是要能持續性的收集並給予反饋，指引下一次調整的方向。具體操作上，可以透過與團隊夥伴定期性的 1-1，練習提供具體且可執行的反饋，幫助彼此成長。這種給予反饋的文化，其實一開始對自己而言是相當陌生的。\n\n一項個人覺得很有用，從書裡學來的小技巧是，有意識的去區分行為 (Behavior)、感受 (Impact)、意圖 (Intent)，三者的差異。在給予反饋時，僅僅陳述行為帶給自己的感受，而非跨界去過度詮釋，對方的意圖。另外是認知到，給予反饋往往不是終點，而是對話的開始。\n\n本質上只要對世界或現況帶有好奇，抱著一個想理解差異，並真心想幫助彼此成長的心態，結果多半不像自己以往腦補的一般尷尬。\n\n### Being Yourself\n\n對自己誠實，簡單的五個字，卻是我這年一直在探索，也是剛入職時跌的最慘，也感受到最多衝擊的。\n\n初期我花了很多時間與自己以及前主管對話，透過一個個的問題，去層層剝掉我心中潛意識對於階級，對於自我質疑的腦補假設。\n\n去年九月的後面幾週，知道組織即將再來個大震動，以及自己的前路會浮出不同的選擇，在最後幾次與前主管的對話中，我們聊了我對於選擇當前，想為自己做決定，卻又充滿各種顧慮，彆扭而衝突的樣子。當這些陳述被赤裸的攤在眼前，大概是那種，你知道這一擊很痛，因為它是真真實實的打在自己一直遮掩的那塊脆弱上。挨著痛，卻也充滿感激，在開始能意識疼痛的路上遇見了這些對話。\n\n我想對於習慣表達心中真實想法的她而言，大概也很難理解本人心中到底有什麼過不去的糾結和腦補劇情，讓我表現出總是有所保留，想要把最完美的那面呈現出來，卻其實弄巧成拙。甚至要逼眼前的新加坡人切換成中文，跟我來場靈魂拷問的對話。\n\n一慣的，她用無數的問題想幫我戳破那些自己腦補的藉口以及怪罪。對於另外一頭，人生多數時間正吃甘蔗，靠著幾套遊戲規則走到現在的我而言，已經習慣把自己放在一個舒服以及知道不會受傷（或受重傷）的位置，於是在裡面享受著極大的自信，也對腦中平行時空，踏出去、張開口，可能就會炸裂的世界，感受著極大的自卑。\n\n幾次我們在討論如何說服對方、在討論職涯的想法時，我總是潛意識裡想找到一個標準答案，一條好像我這麼做了就會世界和平的道路。而她總會適時的提醒我，每個人有著不同的生長背景、經驗與風格。妳看到的這些方式，沒有對與錯、好與壞、階級高低之分。在我向外詢問反饋，想得到一個別人說妳好棒或妳好爛的回應前，我是不是有先問過自己，什麼是我心中理想的樣子？什麼是我感受到與理想的差異？以及我期待以怎樣的行動在下一次，嘗試去縮小這些差異。因為其實多數時候，答案已經在我自己的心中。而也只有嘗試過後的妳，才能修正下一次妳給自己的答案。\n\n短短兩個月的當頭棒喝，為我在與新主管的互動上建立了基礎。也更加清楚，我有責任去勾勒自己想成為的樣子，以及舉手爭取路上所需要的協助，讓主管成為職涯路上的好夥伴。\n\n這包括了最直觀外人看得到的升職、加薪，以及更多內化後的需求，像是想挑戰的領域，想再增長的技能，如何在組織裡面擴大影響力。透過 1-1 的對話，我們能不斷對焦彼此的期待，並給予反饋。而「信任」與「尊重」我覺得也是從這些互動中慢慢積累而來。\n\n**“Only you can read yourself. Don’t try to be a hero.”**\n\n三月時經歷身體與心理最煎熬與低潮的時刻，身體亮起了微紅燈以及工作上處在焦慮值爆表邊緣。回頭看那段時間，對陪在身邊的家人、朋友、主管、同事充滿感激。生活上多點意識到了心理學中所謂「自我疼惜」與「休息」的重要。像是以第三人稱的方式與自己對話，想像是快轉一年或甚至只是一個月後的視角由上俯瞰，可能此刻的關卡，還是在那裡，但卻能透過不同的解讀方式，微微的影響情緒，並且放過當下掙扎不已的自己。\n\n記得在劉軒 Podcast 裡聽到的一段話是：\n\n> **親人、朋友，是那些在我們生命中，輪流登場又退場的人。**\n>\n> **生命，則是在那些登場，退場後，留在身體裡的事。**\n\n也因為走過這段亂流，我覺得在心態上的陣痛與轉變也是這一年很值得記錄下來的部分。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LH8FeyCNdsLRvOGIcdbaH.jpg?height=1108&width=1478)\n\n## The Mindset: Growths and Pains\n\n成長心態與定型心態是很早以前就聽過，但一直覺得理所當然的狀態。以為喜歡學習，喜歡挖掘新事物就是成長心態。常常是真實的與自己對話後，才能理解當下的情緒與失能，其實都來自於定型心態作祟以及對於犯錯的畏懼。\n\n在最低潮的一段時間，聽遍了各大聊心理健康、正念、轉念的中英文 Podcast，書籍。回溯從小到大的軌跡，也發掘了一些不斷循環的模式與選擇邏輯，是成就，也是造就了今天的自己。\n\n同時間開始，嘗試每天的書寫，記錄下微小但值得慶祝的時刻。完全不敢說自己已經能不再受這些情緒影響，但能夠自我覺察和開始嘗試各種方法，我覺得都是很棒的開始。\n\n喜歡把事情梳理成架構的我，也漸漸找到一個給自己的論述框架。多數時間會讓人糾結也在意的，是來自別人的看法與評價，導致過度的重視 *“Looking Good”*，而忽略了去思考背後更長期的價值。\n\n而如果說，長期的追求是能不斷擴大認知圈，將這個世界更多的未知變為已知，那在這個動態擴張的過程裡，*”Getting Better”* 是將未知化為已知的必要條件。而要能 *“Getting Better”*，又必須經過那段，*”Looking … hmm not so good”* 的過程，那我又為何要拿通往長期目標路上的必然來折磨自己？\n\n心態上希望告訴自己的是能夠接納它，甚至應該更主動尋找這些讓妳尷尬，難堪，手足無措的時刻。不去責備自己的錯誤或未知，而是把焦點放在欣賞與肯定自己「理解」並且「處理」的能力，一個能持續地，把未知變成已知的能力。\n\n這件事真的，一點也不簡單，至少對我而言。但走在練習的路上，已能使人感覺良好。\n\n![如果活到 70 歲，人生的 25,550 天與不斷擴張的圈圈們](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d0gJChBiQTqzjUGH41IxF.jpg?height=869&width=1150)\n\n記得剛踏入未知領域時 🚀，心理上一方面興奮萬分，一方面是充滿許多的不安和冒牌者症候群直接點燃。『如果我無法勝任？如果我被看穿？如果我被換掉，會有多難堪？』\n\n過程中也是透過轉念的練習，告訴自己將焦點關注在已經因為這條路上而被擴展的圈圈們。多學到的技術，多遇到的人，多記錄下的時刻。畢竟，即便最終在外人看來，妳回到了原點，但妳也不再是當時的妳，而這一切\n\n***You’ll have nothing to lose.***\n\n## The Next\n\n活好每一天，是寫在書桌旁白板的幾個大字。邁入了在新加坡的第三年，開始重拾許多疫情前的習以為常，像是與 3D 人類，而非視訊或聲音的互動，一張接著一張讓人充滿期待的機票 🛫。\n\n在整理這篇文字時，回頭看了過去一年幾個在高峰與低谷留下的片段。覺得文字很強大的地方，是在雕琢的過程中，能訓練自己把腦中的想法更有系統性的整理下來。而在事過境遷之後，還能給自己回溯成長的軌跡，並在必要之時，提醒自己：Hey 其實妳已經走了很遠，很遠 🛣️\n\n除了留給未來的自己，另一方面是如果有機會幫助到不管是生活或是 PM 職涯，也正在經歷類似心境的人，將會是件很有意義的事：）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aT2JZj05ypTyxJ_eahXQZ.jpg?height=1090&width=1502)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658582279, "digest": "aGVKYIIFeFOZqUUzjv2uua5xPmOVrg6vI27WqUteIhI", "contributor": "0x355aD8EfA2891C762EABe0c9DbbA8b15EE273da9"}

{"id": "H1BXyWxjsIddTmXIXHsnD6bLnKnUgSEeS-rEiDT1t-k", "title": "详解 Cosmos 的垂直扩展之路 ", "body": "## 总览\n\n\n我们已经多次介绍过 Cosmos, 和 Polkadot 类似，Cosmos 这种 Chain Agnostic Layer0 解决方案主要致力于解决其上搭建各种区块链的水平扩展问题， 相较于以太坊， Solana 这种垂直扩展解决方案，Cosmos 可以理解为由各个独立的 zone 组成的水平扩展框架， 而 Zone 可以理解为 Cosmos 框架中各种验证节点，安全假设，并且通过 IBC 进行通讯的主权区块链。\n\n当然相较于以太坊这种节点参与验证所有 issue 的单片链（验证者的容量紧张）而言，应用特定链的网络更具有可扩展性，那么具体怎么理解呢？如果 Zone 发生拥堵，或者区块空间满了，那么另一条区块链可以接入进来，实现水平化扩展。比如 Osmosis 上应用百花齐放，导致链的扩展性遇到了瓶颈，那么可以接入新的链进来，新的链可以有自己的验证节点，也可以以消费链的形式，借用 OSMO 现有节点安全性的方式接入。注意这里水平性扩展和 IBC 的理解，IBC 解决了链与链，Zone 与 Zone 间的通信问题，而不是水平性扩展。比如他们可以通过使用 Rollups， 这些 Rollups 通过 Zone 作为结算层，实现相互通信。\n\n如果一个 Zone 开始拥堵，那么他们也可以在执行层引入 Rollups， 并且使用 Celestia 作为数据可见层。如果某个区域开始过于拥挤，他们可以在执行层实施汇总，并让他们使用 Celestia 作为 DA 层。除了可扩展性，其设计框架和开发者友好的模块化框架也是其核心特色之一。开发者可以使用各种语言（Cosmos SDK 使用的 Go 语言开发，合约却是 Rust；Goland 作为 Cosmos SDK 的分叉，使用 Go 语言的智能合约), 目前主要语言包括 Rust, Golang, CosmWasm, JavaScript 和 Solidity 也即将接入。Cosmos SDK, Tendermint，IBC，CosmWasm 这些 Cosmos 的核心技术堆栈方便了开发者，让开发者可以专注于以应用为导向的特定区块链的开发。\n\n相较于以太坊的可组合性和可编程性，其强调了互操作性和主权性，应用链可以有更多灵活性和选择性定制其性能，运行等参数。同时相较于 POW 等概率性确认出块模型，TendermintBFT 为主导的确定性确认机制下，其抗 MEV 的设计也引入了交易排序机制（Tranasaction order mechainism, Osmosis 是这个机制的先行者），感兴趣的朋友可以看[加密经济的 MEV 博弈：Osmosis 的阈值加密技术 vs Flashbot 的 SGX?](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/EDGUr9jobnxfojLSXRM0oUPRtKcwHeiz0fLtqxqYiwM)。\n\n当然其设计的 trade off 也体现在以下问题，在跨链安全正式上线之前（Q3,2022), 目前所有 Zone 都独立负责其安全性，而以太坊上的应用都依赖于其安全性。而我们之前也提到过，一个网络的安全一定程度上取决于其质押代币维护其网络的价值，而当 TVL 大于这个价值时会给网络带来潜在风险，所以对于一些长尾/新的应用链来说，如何找到合适的安全验证节点，以及维持相对稳定的币价，显得尤为重要。\n\n因此，跨链安全，Osmosis 的超流体质押，以及 Celestia DA，共识以及共享安全都在试图解决这个问题，对这块感兴趣的可以看 [Cosmos 技术原理，设计框架以及生态全览](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/5TaG1uwM_DivhU-2BpY_DRENmx5mmhdMYgr_4IDMeDM)。同时，IBC 目前仅支持同构链的跨链通信，并且链内部可以支持同步交互，而对外，目前 IBC 也正在接入其他以 Polkadot, Near, EVM 等为代表的异构链，对内，IBC 上跨链账户模块的上线也将支持不同链间的同步交互（目前 Juno v8.00，Osmosis，Cosmos Hub 等为代表的链已经接入跨链账户模块）。\n\n所以尽管 Cosmos 的设计存在一些问题，但目前都已经有了不错的解决方案。既然水平化扩展得益于 Cosmos 天然的 “完美” 架构，我们本文将着重于其垂直扩展性的解决方案，其中包括 Celestia，跨链安全，Dymension 等，部分内容来源于我们与相关的团队的交流。\n\n## Celestia\n\n\nCelestia 是目前模块化区块链中最引入注意的项目，致力于解决数据可见性的问题，我们也认为其提出的解决方案（Celestia 是否会一统天下不好说, 但选择的方向是很有前景的）很有可能会成为以太坊和 Cosmos 生态中的中流砥柱。那么 Celesita 究竟解决了什么问题。\n\n我们认为有几个方向，1）扩展性，通过将数据可见层，共识层与执行层分离，通过数据可见采样的方法，让轻节点在无需执行交易的情况下可以确保生产者已经发布了全部的数据。这里要理解的是 Celestia 的轻节点不参与验证交易，而只是需要确保数据可见并且参与数据排序。所以相较于其他 L1 的链，Celestia 节点仅确保数据可见，并且通过 Tendermint 共识协议进行交易排序。而无需像其他 L1 一样参与交易的验证和执行。这个验证交给 Rollups 所依赖的结算层的验证节点，而执行则在 Rollups 的客户端执行。\n\n2）解决 Rollups centric 的扩容路线，目前最大的问题就是 calldata 上链太贵了，尽管目前以太坊的 L2 垂直化扩展解决方案将交易搬到链下，并且通过压缩数据和 calldata 的方式将数据发送至 L1（当然该压缩技术相较于直接发送至 L1，成本降低了不少），但是成本仍然很高，因此 Celestia 试图解决这个问题。举个例子来说，对于以太坊 Rollups 来说，他们可以选择将 Celestia 作为 DA 层。Celestia 会将这些处理证明（而非压缩数据本身，这些证明可以理解为比上传数据便宜的多的一篮子签名和默尔克根，）发送至以太坊，并且通过批量处理的方式优化燃料费用，所以这比 Rollups 将压缩数据直接上传以太坊要便宜的多，整个流程可以理解为以太坊 Rollup -> Celestia -> 以太坊主网。当然这个问题也在以太坊 2.0 中有相关的解决方案（EIP-4884), EIP-4844 引入了和调用数据不一样的一种交易格式，带有数据碎片的交易，从而进行存储。数据碎片可以承载 125KB 的数据，同时在和同等数据量的调用数据相比，便宜很多。这些数据碎片通常在一个月之后会被删除，从而降低了存储要求。而这一个月的时间足够让验证者去完成数据采样中的安全假设。具体可以看[以太坊扩容终极解决方案 - Danksharding（一）](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/3I9uBeEvPqMG9Cl8HBVvEh0-cNELLbObdegLDDjcpq8)，[以太坊扩容终极解决方案 - Danksharding 与 MEV 设计（二](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/S5KULzG3QJsk02J693wmw9HqDvQvz7lNP4VEFYF9nWA)）。\n\n3）多虚拟机部署的灵活性，和以太坊上的 Rollups 不同，Celestia 上的 Rollups 不一定专门为 EVM 兼容的欺诈证明/有效性证明实现。据我们所知，Celestia 已经和很多团队开展了合作（还未官宣）。这打开了 Celestia 可支持的虚拟机的设计空间，并且开放给更多的开发者。我们看到了 Starkware、LLVM、MoveVM、CosmWasm、FuelVM 等拥有可支持操作，数据库结构，交易格式，软件语言的自定义虚拟机，在处理特定应用场景的同时也能够实现最优的性能。针对于 FuelVM, 我们可以关注最近上线的 Fuelv1, Fuel 与今天的 ORus 的最大区别在于，它运行一个全新的 VM 架构，即 FuelVM 及其工具链和语言。FuelVM 具有 WASM、EVM 和 Solana 的 SeaLevel 的特征。FuelVM 最引人注目的潜在方面是它在基于 UTXO 的数据模型上执行。\n\n关于未来多 VM 的格局的想法我们也在 [CosmWasm：进化的虚拟机与智能合约](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/iHNGFwTAEDGAUuuK4UPtyBt4XNIDFWX94Q68XpHw2yg)一文中进行了描述。当然还有轻松部署，有效资源定价等优势，这里我们就不一一讨论了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97UIM9Ih2PyiGmW7h2EWo.png?height=555&width=1080)\n\n Celestia 中最核心的设计是其数据可见采样 (DAS)，这也是欺诈证明/有效证明的前提。而 DAS 的关键在于抹除码技术，这意味着任何数据通过抹除码技术，可以实现数据大小的翻倍，并且可以通过扩展数据的任何一定百分比的数据，对原有数据进行恢复。通过这种方式，Celestia 上的轻节点可以以数据采样的方式，获取小块数据，并且基于较高的概率，保证数据的可见性。\n\n当然为了确保足够的数据样本，从而用于恢复数据，这个抽样过程应该保证参与节点的数量。DAS 的一个核心特点是当参与节点采集的数量越多，采集的数据越多，那么基于同样的概率假设下，更多的数据可以被验证。所以理论上，当参与的节点数量越多，区块的大小可以更大，支持更多 TPS，这个和单片链的设计不同，在单片链中，节点数量越多（全节点验证），为了确保去中心化的实现，区块大小/燃料限制的设置抑制状态的增长，从而降低了全节点的成本。\n\n当然这个设计的 trade off 问题就是尽管轻节点可以享有与全节点同等的安全性，但是其受限于 O(√n) 的带宽成本，其中 n 为区块大小。所以 Celestia 数据可见的吞吐量主要受限于以下两点：\n\n1. 可以集体采样的数据量\n2. 轻节点的目标块头大小\n\n目前 Celesita 上的节点类型包括两种：\n\n共识节点\n\n验证节点：参与共识。\n\n共识全节点：同步区块链历史的 Celestia-App 全节点。\n\n数据可用性节点\n\n桥节点：在数据可用性网络和共识网络之间桥接区块。\n\n全存储节点：存储所有数据但不连接共识。\n\n轻节点：轻客户端在数据可用性网络上进行数据可用性采样。\n\nOptimint 是允许链作为 Rollups 部署于 Celestia 的产品。这些链可以启动自己的 P2P 网络，将交易数据收集到区块中，并且将他们发布到 Celestia 主网，负责数据可见和共识。Optimint 本质上是一个供开发人员使用的框架，基于其搭建的链无需寻找安全的验证器，Celestia 会为他们处理工作。\n\nOptimint 可以理解为 Celestia 的共识层，它提供了一个交易排序框架，可用于数据可用性层和结算层（但是不参与交易的验证）。这个似乎和我们下文将介绍的 Cosmos Hub 即将上线的跨链安全的理念相似，而 Optiminent 是否会对跨链安全造成威胁，我们也将结合他们共识的差异性来判断。但尽管如此，我们认为 Celestia 的先进理念，以及其在 Cosmos 和以太坊生态中的重要性要等到上线后才能得知（2023 年）。对 Celestia 感兴趣的，可以看我们的 [Celestia 的模块化架构](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/fzB21y2BH7mIzVblrmnzsUrvk3fB3BhYDJO__Nb_Lgw)和 [Celestia 2 - 技术实践](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/q1ig8FgutU5HAOqfO0IkDxIzew8ZA2Fl0-eFVr2HRfs)。\n\n## 跨链安全\n\n\n跨链安全本质上可以理解为租借安全性，目前 V1 版本中仅支持 Cosmos Hub 的全部节点。当然对于模块本身，是一个可插拔，可选择的模块。对于选择接入的消费链而言，在 V1 版本中，消费链必须强制接入 175 个验证节点，并且需要治理通过, 本质上是一种带有准入机制的产品。消费链需要提交团队的核心产品，和理念，在确保足够的 Atom 持有者投票通过后，才可以接入。同时，消费链也需要支付一定的费用（% 通胀费用）给到验证者节点，这个比例也需要在治理提案中明确，同时在 V1 中，消费链将 75% 的燃料费给到国库 DAO，又多签钱包管理，而 25% 的燃料费给到 Hub, 激励验证节点和质押者。\n\n在我们之前的文章中也提到过，团队可以选择创建（体现了灵活性和可选择性）“自定义消费链” 或 “合约消费者链（通过 CosmWasm 实现）”。两者之间的主要区别在于验证节点运行的二进制文件。合约消费者链中的二进制文件是标准的，而自定义消费链中，团队可以灵活地自定义二进制文件以适应不同的交易费用和交易组装。ICS 总共会有三个版本，第一个版本是消费链的安全完全由 Cosmos Hub 节点维护。而这些消费链是否能够接入需要 Cosmos Hub 通过治理根据他们的风险概况最终决定（比如是一条基于 Cosmwasm 开发的消费合约链还是一条 SDK 无变化的消费自定义链）。\n\n因此，Atom 质押者需要决定他们质押的验证节点，因为在享受额外收益的同时，也会面临和其他 POS 链一样消费链节点宕机和不当行为风险。第一个版本中，消费链和 Cosmos Hub 享有了共同的安全保证。但这种情况下的参与 ICS 的节点所质押的 Atom 价值和这些节点会面临的 Slashing 风险。同时，对于验证节点来说，需要额外的硬件要求，从而保证工作量。而第二个版本中，消费链可以将自己的质押代币与 Cosmos Hub 的 Atom 代币相结合，并最终确定消费链的验证器集组成。而 V3 版本中，这种关系会进一步扩大和加深，可以在双向大型网络间实现横向共享安全协议，Cosmos Hub 可以和任何其他 Cosmos SDK 项目的验证集共享 Atom 价值，反之亦然，可以将其理解为主权网络的相互安全保险。而在 V3 版本中，Hub 验证节点可以有权停止验证哪条链。第二，三个版本相较于第一个版本，网络安全将最终取决于消费链和供应链共同的安全。\n\n而对于 Cosmos Hub 的部分参与的节点来说，如果消费链上的唯一验证节点恶意进行攻击，会有女巫攻击的可能性。目前可以关注的项目包括 Quicksilver 和 Neutron(P2P，一个大节点搭建的自定义合约链）。对于跨链安全想要进一步了解的，可以看深度分析 Cosmos 的开拓者 - [Osmosis，继 IBC 之后，看 ICS, ICA 如何重构加密行业](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/uHyMMkSaTY5T2AjRm8ctbFyUTp14jIou9c_xv4XvsHg)和 [Cosmos Thessis- Osmosis 应用主权链的崛起](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/yPWoPgFyNWzQgkFskpt03oaDv9uKJj3wPHG_m5TV6N4)。\n\n## dYmension\n\n\ndYmension 对于自己的定位，认为其对于 rollups 的重要性类似于 Cosmos 对于整个区块链行业的重要性。dYmension 是基于 Cosmos 搭建的结算层和执行层，给 Rollups 提供了灵活和可选择的 chain-agnostic 执行层环境。核心的产品（Rollups Development Kit) RDK 开发套件, 类似于 CosmosSDK 模块，目前除了 dYmension, Celestia 和 Cosmos 也在开发 RDK。这个开发套件为开发者提供了在 Cosmos 上轻松构建 Rollups 的所有工具和基础架构。dYmension 目标为 enshriend rollups，而非 Discret Rollups。Enshrined rollups 有更多的灵活性和选择，为用户提供了更多的灵活度，以及保证了最大化安全和稳定，而 Arbitrum, Optimism, StarkNet, zkSync, Aztec etc. 等为代表的 Disrete Rollups 则提供了好的技术路径和品牌。Polynya 认为短中期，discret rollups 会被大部分用户接受，而长期来讲，两者方案可能可以实现共存。\n\n同时，dyMension 也试图在解决 keeper 困境，女巫攻击等问题。Keeper 问题可以表现为，在某些情况下，套利者因为无利可图，或者激励不明确，所以针对某些仓位（比如 MakerDAO 上 120 美金的小仓位), 并不会进行清算，这导致了巨鲸可以将大仓位分散为不同仓位，通过付出一定成本，而保证仓位不受清算，影响网络整体稳定性的可能性。当然对于这个门槛值，由于受到不同市场环境，时间等影响，并没有办法进行确认。尽管 MakerDAO 清算 2.0 升级有望使整个清算过程更加简单和可预测。然但是实际情况要更为复杂，为了应对一些黑天鹅事件，这些清算者通常要提前几个月准备复杂的交易和对冲系统，这对于散户来说是无法想象的。\n\n目前市场上大部分清算系统都是激励给最快的清算者，这使得网络暴露在大量的 MEV 风险下，使得很多的收益给到了矿工，而不是真正的清算者，所以对于很多专业的做市商而言，他们也并没有参与搭建相关的系统，并且参与整个清算过程。Dymension 的具体解决方案目前还不能共享，但是我们在这个赛道也看到了很多其他的竞争对手，比如 Kujira, 在脱离了 Terra 生态的束缚后，在短短 1 个月多的时间里，完成了应用链的部署，并且迅速跻身于 mapofzone 前十的位置。Kujiara 的清算方法采用了不同的方法。平仓池由持有需要平仓头寸的合约直接调用。确保可以在链上搜索可清算头寸需要做更多的工作，但这意味着所有价值捕获都交给了矿池参与者。\n\n对于更复杂的头寸，用户可以轻松地在链上进行索引和搜索，Kujiara 会向机器人运行者提供一小笔 “曲柄” 费用以帮助实际执行清算，但资金仍将来自清算池。所以它仍然是民主的，并且有足够的规模来清算最大的贷款。项目的更多信息我们之后分享给社群小伙伴。dYmension 仍然非常早期，我们将持续关注其之后的发展，本质上你可以理解为以太坊的执行层和结算层设计，但是他继承了 Cosmos 设计的精髓，比如 Rollups 之间的互操作性（Thanks to the IBC and Cosmos 的原生互操作性）以及模块化设计（可插拔以及轻松部署等开发者用好体验）。当然还有可定制化执行环境的 Saga，这里我们就不详细阐述了，各个解决方案的对比可以见下图。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4YdfzfNVotLnt2BhhwycO.png?height=1048&width=900)\n\n##  总结\n\n\n至此，我们梳理了市面上大部分的 Cosmos 生态的垂直扩展性解决方案。当然我们目前以太坊-rollups centric 的地位仍然不可撼动，所以在我们关注 Cosmos 的同时，我们也需要密切关注以太坊上的发展以及 Solana 这种在执行层发力，创新（而非共识层）的公链。Fuel V1 作为以太坊上推出的第一个 ORUs，目前是唯一具有欺诈证明、不可变智能合约和无许可区块生产, 为 P2P 支付而设计的 Rollups。而 Fuel V2 将会是一个模块化执行层，在 UTXO 上提供以太坊式的智能合约，使用 Ethereum/Celestia 进行结算、数据可用性和共识，切入多个应用场景。\n\n我们看到共识层的创新很多，Bitcoin,EVM,Tendermint 他们都是建立底层共识算法维护网络免受攻击的系统。但是真正在现实工业应用中，执行层的需求量或许更大，用户需要更便宜的燃料费用，网络需要更高吞吐量和性能，Solana, Aptos/Sui 这种链也正试图解决执行层问题。我们将在之后的文章中讨论。", "timestamp": 1658583615, "digest": "1WSXyfyze2qgJDBzkD5KDSnIEEUOci21_6VjCFg-B_k", "contributor": "0xf1E26c020a084E77A4931fEE4c997a2b064566fc"}

What is the meaning of bringing your “authentic self” to work.\n\nSuccinctly, it is to bring your “true identity” to a professional setting; something that most would tend to avoid by creating a “work identity or work self”.\n\nBeing authentic is also the ability to share your values, your emotions and your vulnerabilities; keys to building lasting working relationships.\n\nWhilst these are essentials in real world working environments, it is as important to create an online digital identity that reflects these characteristics.\n\nYour online digital identity is your online personal branding and it matters to inform the corporate world on questions such as;\n\n* What do you stand for?\n* What motivates and inspires you?\n* What is your purpose?\n* What are your priorities?\n* What is important to you?\n\nAt the moment, our ability to be authentic in Web 2.0 is limited by the functionality of the social media platform that we engage in and the limitations associated with them.\n\nOur authenticity is regulated by an algorithm, an artificial intelligence which determines our identity through our behaviors on the platform i.e. from our posts, from our likes and from our views.\n\nCompounded by the intention of getting our messages out, or to enable virality, we are not able to be authentic in all our engagements with these platforms.\n\nThis is however changing with the nascent Web 3.0: the blockchain technology which brings us the NFT and Metaverse.\n\n## Identity in Web 3.0\n\n**Your digital identity today is determined by your online behavior on the web.**\n\nYour behaviours are tracked by all the major social media platforms where you consume, share and transact information, indulge in entertainment or engage in e-commerce activities.\n\nIn short, you have no control on your digital identity as these are defined by these mega platforms which continue to find ways to analyze your online behaviors with little regard to who you truly are.\n\n**However, the next iteration of Digital Identity is an open, decentralized system where you will be able to link your digital identity to your real-world identity.**\n\nDavid Chalmers, Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science at New York University, who authored the book, “*Reality+*”, ventured further to postulate that in time to come, \\*“\\*Virtual Reality is Genuine Reality”.\n\nIn his book, he speculated that one day, we will be able to upload our brain: transferring our minds from a biological brain into a digital computer, rendering a  “simulated brain”.\n\nAnd for this to be feasible, we must overcome three major obstacles:\n\n* *Intelligence* : will the upload behave like us\n* *Consciousness* : will the upload be conscious? And last but not least\n* ***Identity:*** Will the upload be me?\n\nWhilst the prospect of such an upload is distant, all three criteria are now feasible with the nascent Web 3.0 albeit not with a simulated brain.\n\nWe are now able to extend and have full control of our intelligence, consciousness and above all identity in the blockchain.\n\nIt is this author’s opinion that identity is the most important characteristic of our internet persona but is also the most vulnerable in our Web 2.0 environment. Our identity is constantly under threat from hacking, theft and misrepresentation.\n\nThat is however changing with the introduction of the brave new world of internet that is founded on decentralized blockchain technology.\n\nAt this point of writing, there are 3 measures that one can take to protect and to express an authentic online identity. They are;\n\n**1. Procuring a Web3 Username such as the Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**\n\nThe concept of ENS is not something new to us. As a user of the internet, we interact daily with its soon to be predecessor the DNS: Domain Name Service.\n\nDNS has allowed numerical and complex IP addresses to be translated into recognizable and memorable names, giving it a unique identity and branding.\n\nThe service provided by DNS enabled a whole new slew of internet services which jumpstarted some of the Big Tech that we know of today, such as Google. Instead of typing a string of numerical code to search for an internet page, we are able to do so by entering  simple Latin alphabets into a Google search bar.\n\nENS offers the same convenience and unique identity.\n\n**2. IdeNFTy: Transforming your online digital identity into a digital asset with NFT**\n\nNFT created a new opportunity for us to transform our digital identity, which in essence our online personal branding into a digital asset, a new asset class.\n\nWe are now able to define ownership of our biggest asset in the internet, which in essence is our *intellectual property,* especially our representation in the digital world of who we are, our ideas and our achievements.\n\nIn other words, your resume or curriculum vitae is now an asset which has an appreciative value as your career progresses.\n\nYour NFT will continue to gain value as your career progresses.\n\n***Why IdeNFTy?***\n\nIf content is king in Web 2.0, community will be the key in Web 3.0\n\nWith NFT, you can be part of a community which shares your values and your purpose.\n\nIdeNFTy, an NFT by Corporate Disruptors Forum, qualifies our professional colleagues in identifying innovation as the agent of change in shaping a sustainable future for the society and organizations.\n\nBy minting a NFT with IdeNFTy, you will be part of a community that believes in human ingenuity, coming together to chart alternative sustainable directions for a disruptive business environment.\n\n![Author's IdeNFTy at OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CRyHOukrKIS1hTKdPhwF9.png?height=1008&width=1010)\n\nIn conclusion, some of the reasons that would compel you to acquire IdeNFTy are;\n\n* Authentic records: built on the Blockchain technology, NFT provides digital proof of ownership and authenticity of your records. Your profile will never be copied and pasted, or risked being misrepresented by scammers and fraudsters.\n* Defining Your Personal Branding: Curate a digital asset which showcase your values, your passion and your purpose.\n* Immerse into the Metaverse: In the fast developing Metaverse, NFT are the digital assets that provide utility to the world. For e.g. virtual lands in metaverse are NFTs.  Your digital NFT may be the beginning of your Metaverse identity.\n* Own a digital asset that can grow in value over time. We believe that the work you do, the passion that you pursue, the career that you built will have a direct impact on the value of your NFT overtime.\n* Own your own NFT Avatar, a digital portrait of yourself. Part of what we do is the creation of a digital art that best represents you, which you can own unlike a picture that can be copy and pasted from any of the social media platforms today.\n* Be part of the Corporate Disruptors Forum Community whereby you are counted among your peers in the forefront of innovation specifically corporate innovation.\n\n**3. Managing NFT Avatars in the Metaverse**\n\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT Avatar is one the most defining NFT that has captured the imagination of the NFT collectibles.\n\nIt is also one of the most successful NFT avatars, with a single Bored Ape selling at an average of 110 ETH or US$ 319,947 in February 2022.\n\nThese Bored Apes are algorithmically generated from 170 possible traits to give each Bored Ape unique identifiable traits, which in return gives the owner an identity and membership to the Bored Ape Yacht Club community.\n\nMinted to be of just 10,000, it is also exclusive in nature with perks that can be gained only with the identity associated with the ape.\n\nThese are essential ingredients to one being recognized as part of an elite and committed member of the community.\n\nAnd now the need for this recognition is accentuated by the growth of the Metaverse.\n\nAzuki, an anime inspired NFT collection gives its owners access to “The Garden Metaverse” where the Azuki NFT avatars become their owners’ identity to interact with the community.\n\nThis is a growing trend as we will see more metaverses with its own unique value proposition that will attract a community which shares its values. These avatars will be an extension of ourselves in the metaverse.\n\nFinally, if the proof of the pudding is eating it, Azuki NFT Avatar collection has dethroned Bored Ape Yacht Club by selling US$ 148 million from its collection.\n\n## Moving forward\n\nAs of the time of publishing this document, WorldWideWeb Consortium (W3C) has proposed the adoption of Decentralized Identifiers (DID) , a new type of unambiguous identifier that can be used to identify any subject.\n\nThe major difference between DID and IdeNFTy is that IdeNFTY is aimed to be a digital asset, a collectible while DID is a new tool to empower online identity.\n\nLastly, the potential of owning a digital identity NFT is enormous as it is a digital asset that could grow with your presence in the web, especially web3.0.  This is pivotal to corporate executives who are building a personal brand; an essential component in their career development.\n\n### About the Author\n\n**Ivan Yong Wei Kit** is the co-founder of **Corporate Disruptors Forum** ([www.corporatedisruptors.com](http://www.corporatedisruptors.com/)),an international platform for accelerating corporate innovation, entrepreneurship and corporate-startup collaboration.

{"id": "GTUUTvBSXAcNeFV8X7SOEm1lHhhRkd9J5Z3vpCViP78", "title": "MacOS + IOS x Crypto + OpSec = ?", "body": "In my favorite chat room recently I [was asked](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/363628), in light of recent events, would it be safer to use MacOS & IOS for work? Is it true that they have better security? I don't have a definite answer here - both yes and no. Let's get to the bottom of it!\n\nFirst of all, There are a lot of malware for MacOS/IOS, the thing is that exploits 0days/1day for MacOS/IOS costs slightly more in than Windows/Android.\n\nThere is no difference, just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits (including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits - they always cost more), I suggest you go to [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/) and see the prices.\n\nIn general, the toolkit is more or less the same so don't assume that MacOS is more secure. Again, it is based on FreeBSD. In other words, know who is working against you and what they are capable of.\n\nIn other words, the chances of getting into a massive attack are less, but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 5-10 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems.\n\nHackers also care about economics, profit and cost. If they are confident they can take the risk. Keep that in mind.\n\nUse Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails or Graphene OS (which is way better then closed and thus unable to estimate risks IOS.

{"id": "DrN-_kmYcgNE2dvj9kT7rgi-XU9-zqVuW6kWcP7gNzo", "title": "新中特读书笔记（草稿）", "body": "1\\.多巴胺神经回路主管欲望（想要更多）和控制（谋划和执行）。 注：相关认识来自《贪婪的多巴胺》的科普。\n\n当下神经回路：注重现实世界的事。\n\n多巴胺欲望回路：\n名欲：希望获得家人朋友同学邻居等等身边人的尊敬和称赞。出门在外，江湖行走，你抬我一下，我抬你一下，会做人。\n利欲：希望获得更多社会资源。体现在贪腐中，损公肥私，能捞一把算一把。\n色欲：物种繁衍。\n还有食欲求知欲等等等。\n\n多巴胺控制回路：此回路活跃时会抑制多巴胺欲望回路，提现了人类的理性。这里会进行推理谋划，执行，实现目标理想。\n理想，一种使人类尽善尽美的愿景。\n各类知识，抽象化的概念，比如哲学，文学，艺术，军事等等等。\n\n教员：坚定的理想主义者，知识面掌握的比较全，军事，政治，哲学，文学，史学等等等。《论持久战》对未来作出了充分地展望，指明了历史前进的道路。\n\n2\\.听人说有人就有战争，有战争人就希望有和平。我对此的理解是人们往往会想要同一件事物，没有人肯退让，大打出手。这次受伤害较少的一方，风水轮流转，下次可能会反过来。死的人死了，活的人生不如死，痛不欲生，“宁为太平犬，不为乱世人”。\t在亲兄弟之间，因为财物大打出手；因为美色争风吃醋；宗族之间因为争水，大打特打；国家之间，要获得对方的土地，粮食等等等。\n\n3\\.欲的触发往往需要一定的条件，当老师给别的同学小红花，你可能也会想要；当你饿了或闻到香味，会触发食欲；当你看到性感的美人时，会触发色欲；当别人给你送礼时，会触发利欲。古人追求的是为万世开太平，使民不争斗。老子提出“祸莫大于可欲”（祸患没有什么比可以引起人的欲望的东西更大的了），不上贤，不贵难得之货等等等。伊斯兰教对妇女蒙面等其他要求，估计也是为了减少社会的争斗。现代社会放开了一些要求，不过也伴随着原配小三之间的斗争，某些男性喜当爹，等等社会争斗。\n\n4\\.这里从激励的角度谈谈前后三十年的对比。前三十年的激励主要是理想，名（荣誉），利可能也有（加工资），每个人都能结婚，色的方面可能没有。每个人的大脑的生理结构不同，有的人比较容易被理想驱动，有的人比较容易被名利色等等驱动，有的人怎么都不太容易被驱动。\n\n到后三十年激励设定应该是这样，想要满足欲望的人，去干实业，发展生产力。假如成功了，赚到了不少钱，住大房子，开豪车，尽情大吃美食，你会受到人们的尊重称赞，会获得异性的倾慕等等等。即使你比较懒，你总会饿，总要去找饭吃，原始人饿的时候，会出去觅食，工业时代去打工，社会总生产还会增加，生产力得到了解放。在科技方面也是这样，你可以申请专利，收专利费。\n\n蒸汽机是把蒸汽的热能转换为机器的机械能。中特的设定应该是把人的欲望转换为社会的生产力，有坚定理想的人可以去从政，使整个治理系统能够有效运转；可以从教，培养优良事物下一代；可以去科研等等等。\n\n当然这只是理想的情况，在现实中会产生各种漏洞，不够完善，有时迫于国内外的压力也不得不做一些妥协。这就需要同时代最有理想、最有谋略、最有韧性的人来为治理系统提供支撑。\n\nPS:再加一些小故事，有位朋友说，他迷恋一位姑娘，因二本学历不够自信，于是极度自律，考上了当地的985，在他们学校狠狠地出了一把风头；在一些电影中也有类似的例子，男主角成绩很差，不过喜欢上了好成绩女学生，然后刻苦读书，极度自律，感动天地，获得了月老的关注，一起考上了厦大；在我的身边也有一些这样的例子，邻居家的孩子，因不想上学，去打工了，然后打工太苦，又回来奋发读书了；还有一些是，在私企被毒打的太狠，然后寻求体制的庇护的。\n\n5\\.一般来说，有系统就有漏洞，就要打补丁。像Windows系统，过几天打一个补丁，过几年重新发布一个新系统，来保证整个系统的安全性，与时俱进性。像农业大跃进，上级可能由于远离农业，制定了太高的指标，下级执行部门，又具有迎合上级的天性，开始造假，当时有没有制定更好地校验标准，形成了漏洞，造成了后面的伤害。制定好的指标以及校验流程，一直是个难事，高校以前把发论文作为指标，就是因为它不太容易伪造，两权相害取其轻，其他的太适合伪造了。高中升学，如果你能有什么大奖，就能免考。这时候，聪明的家长，就开始动脑子了，开始操作各种奖项了。\n\n随着时间的发展，人们往往会利用治理系统的漏洞，来获取非对称收益（微小的付出，获得巨大的回报）。到一定时候，就要进行一定的改革，切掉身体的毒瘤，来保持治理系统的正常运转。小的改革相当于打补丁，大的改革相当于重写系统。在历史上，一般能打补丁打补丁，不行的话，再进行治理系统部分模块的重写，再不行的话，等治理系统自动崩溃，然后产生一套新系统。像王安石进行变法，主要是没有足够多志同道合的人，凝聚出足够多力量，去扛住（既得利益者）堕落官僚集团的反扑。\n\n明朝治理系统里皇帝是用来约束士人集团，选拔继承人用的是嫡长子继承制来避免皇室的内斗，这样就产生了漏洞，如果皇帝不明事理（太小、太老、太笨等等），就会使士人集团野蛮生长，威害整个治理系统。洪武三十年，这是朱元璋人生倒数第二年，以前可能一天能处理一百封奏折，现在估计只能问问最要紧的事了，其他只能交给代办了。当时南北汉人割裂很严重，互相不对眼。南方士人于是趁朱元璋年老，发动了南北榜案进行测试，为日后攫取更大的利益做铺垫。二次复阅上呈的试卷“文理不佳，并有犯禁忌之语”，侮辱朱元璋智商。最后朱元璋临死之前，强提一口气，带走了一波人头。\n\n6\\.在这里试着解释一下躺平之风的原因。\n\n第一，当你看着别人靠炒房等等各种投机方式，较为轻松地获得了巨大汇报，谁还愿意累死累活挣这俩钱。从这个角度看，是一种非暴力，不合作的态度。有个博弈论故事是，俩个人一起去打猎，如果打到的猎物按四六分，那还好，如果按一九分乃至1：99分，估计要绝交，甚至打得头破血流。\n\n第二，教育不充分。一个勤俭持家的家庭里的孩子，受到他父母言传身教的影响，很可能也是这样的。如果，天天不见父母，这方面的教育就缺了。还有就是，如果小孩接触到的其他人，风气都比较正，那么他成年后，也会成才。现代社会原子化严重，邻居都不太熟，现实里见得人少一些，网上多一些，而网上又有很多一些人在发泄情绪不担心自己被熟人认出来，难免受到不好的影响。\n\n第三，从乱世存活下来的人，更为坚韧一些，治世出生的人，更娇弱一些。\n\n第四，市场的劳动模块还不够完善，部分私企对工人的压榨过于严重。\n\n7\\.一般开国之时，国家的治理能力很高，随着时间的脚步，会有所下降，也会一直遭受偶然事件的冲击，来考验治理能力，直到化解不了，引发治理系统崩溃，然后重建治理系统。\n\n一般来说，在乱世，最有理想、最有谋略、最有韧性的团队最终会打造新的治理系统，其他的团队会被战争无情的淘汰。在团队内部也是这样，经过不断的战争，淘汰不适合的人，最终团队内部关键人物都有理想、有谋略、有韧性。之前还看到这样的传闻，一些领导人让他们的亲戚努力工作，不要想着走后门，由此可见，初代领导人团队的品质，毕竟人们更关注亲近之人实在是人之常情。\n\n然后在治世，缺乏像战争那样有效的筛选机制，造成治理团队素质下降，治理能力下降。在整个过程中，会有连续不断的偶然事件，对治理系统进行压力测试，另外一些散落江湖的高素质人才也会做一些准备，正所谓“君子藏器于身，待时而动”。在秦末，陈胜吴广这一偶然事件对秦廷进行了压力测试，秦廷没通过，然后刘邦项羽等各路豪杰纷纷起义（刘邦早年游离四方，回家后暗中积蓄力量）；在元末，朱元璋也是先游历四方，红巾军发动了压力测试，元朝没通过，各路豪杰响应，朱元璋在皇觉寺收到了汤和的信，去投奔郭子兴了；上世纪八九风波是国内外各种因素作用下，发起的压力测试，被迅速通过了，不愧是初代领导人。\n\n8\\.使体制内现有人员保持较高素质的一些方法。\n\n第一，坚定理想信念。治欲如治水，有堵有疏，通向理想多一些，就会抑制杂七杂八的欲望。有一些国企，每天都要半个小时学习强国，还有各种会来学习讲话精神。时间一久，多巴胺控制回路得到更多的锻炼，就会反过来抑制多巴胺欲望回路，就能体现教育效果了。\n\n第二，是刑法和党规党纪。这个是通过人对刑罚的畏惧，激活了肾上腺素神经回路来抑制多巴胺欲望回路。\n\n还有就是进入机制和退出机制。进入是公务员考试和选调生等考试。退出机制是违法违纪会辞退。这套进入机制不能很好筛选出有理想，有谋略，有韧性的人，有些公务员想着躺平摸鱼，有些想着损公肥私钻治理系统漏洞。\n\n9\\.科技往往是辅助建立更高级治理系统的有力工具。\n\n* 或许考虑引进先进的脑科学研究是一个方向，反社会人格的大脑生理结构会和普通人不一样，理想人选的大脑生理结构想必也有相应的生理特征。\n* 现在可以通过视频，这一方式可以最大限度地强化体制内人员地理想。\n* 现在信息流动更加方便，人民群众能对体制内形成更有效地监督。\n* 读书学习更加方便，人民群众中会有更多人，借此机会完成自我教育，自觉拥护党中央的决策。\n\nPS：通过对易经乾卦比葫芦画瓢，以求职为例，写了一下做事的过程。\n\n在此之前你要有个求职目标。\n\n1\\.潜龙勿用\n刚开始不要乱动。\n\n2\\.见龙在田，利见大人。\n不调查清楚不决策。在这一阶段，做广泛的调研，去搜索信息，向前辈咨询。为我们的目标展开筹划，明确整个求职的基本过程和关键节点，把握求职成功的基本要素。\n\n3\\.君子终日乾乾，夕惕若厉，无咎。\n不准备充分不行动。在各种要素上努力达到一个标准，比如笔试，面试等等等。不要犯大错误。\n\n4\\.或跃在渊，无咎。\n这是招聘正式开始了。注意不要犯下严重错误。\n\n5\\.飞龙在天，利见大人。\n成了！可以结交一下同事，与公司的前辈咨询一下如何开展工作生活什么的。\n\n6\\.亢龙有悔。\n万物必有盛衰，万事必有弛张。这是正常的回归均值，不过都是上班以后的事了。。。\n\n\n这只是个人不成熟的想法，希望能引出高见，来修改补充。", "timestamp": 1658584944, "digest": "I-gNw9o3IJXz0Ot4wO75YNr5wcN9VR5GaD4oFOgg3xk", "contributor": "0xd9B9DcCeaf794F3eEE5AF93214adeE8856fb42c8"}

{"id": "OUkjLhCDo8PfW8O_YB3QoVqEftcN2oj_ULtIQYB_IuQ", "title": "a16z is Moving to the Cloud", "body": "Since our inception in 2009, Andreessen Horowitz has been a Silicon Valley venture capital firm. This was highly intentional on our part. Historically, the largest number of great technology companies emerged from Silicon Valley for good reason – the network effect. Many things drove the network effect, but the most important was this: If you were a great technology entrepreneur born anywhere in the world where it was difficult to start a company such as Bangladesh or The Sudan or Marianna, Arkansas, and you decided to move, the place you were most likely to move to was Silicon Valley. As a result, Silicon Valley became the place that attracted most of the great national and international talent.\n\nThen in 2020, COVID-19 hit and technology companies were forced to figure out how to work remotely. It turns out that running a technology company remotely works pretty darned well. It’s not perfect, but mitigating the cultural issues associated with remote work turns out to be easier than mitigating the employee satisfaction issues associated with forcing everyone into the office 5 days/week. As a result, nearly every technology company has moved to a remote or hybrid approach to work and this change is profoundly weakening the Silicon Valley network effect.\n\nThis is a very good thing for the country and the world. As my partner Marc wrote in his 2011 article, “[Software Is Eating the World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/),” every important new company is likely to have a world-class software team at its core. Concentrating all of those companies into one or two geographies cuts off great opportunities from anyone who can contribute, but cannot easily move. Remote work is opening up many new locations for entrepreneurs and technology workers. We embrace that by changing our own operating model.\n\nIn our firm’s new operating model, we work primarily virtually, but will use our physical presence to develop our culture, help entrepreneurs, and build relationships. Specifically, the firm is now virtual, but can materialize physically on command.\n\nAs a result, we have configured the firm to be able to physically assemble anywhere in the world very quickly. To that end, we are opening 3 new offices in Miami Beach, New York, and Santa Monica in addition to our existing Menlo Park and San Francisco locations. Our headquarters will be in the cloud and we will continue to create physical offices globally where needed to support our teams and partners.\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\n## ", "timestamp": 1658584972, "digest": "_bxRD8v_l_wP-oUse__DvV8QocGBirTxZlFRn53GJqo", "contributor": "0x1d5340448B8EB32B1Fef1e263755C1Ca8bF6A05A"}

Hopefully will be able to make it a weekly thing.\n\n## Sam Kazemian on Market Capping\n\n### Fun Fact\n\nFRAX logo/symbol is the unspecified general currency sign - when internet came out they had a placeholder for general currency symbol, for what they thought would be the general internet currency symbol.\n\n### FRAX, Curve & FraxBasePool\n\n* Frax started out of the concept that if you have a protocol that controls its own liquidity and collateral like, you can deploy it into AMM's and the protocol itself can earn yield and transaction fees.\n* Before, instead everybody just rented liquidity and paid their governance token to rent liquidity inside of these AMMs/DEX's.\n* Curve AMO that Frax developed, (which is just a smart contract that sends collateral and extra FRAX into FRAX's curve pool), essentially allows Frax to become largest TVL and controllers of liquidity on Curve.\n* Obviously 4pool won't be happening anymore. Frax went back to drawing board to implement/create a similar system, that can be done risk-free: a FraxBasePool where Frax can allow other projects to pair with FRAX liquidity.\n* FraxBasePool: Just FRAX-USDC (least risky because USDC is basically tokenized treasuries).\n  * Any project that pairs with FRAX base pool will proportionally get incentivized by demand they create.\n  * When projects use 3pool, they have to basically rent liquidity and subsidize USDC-DAI-USDT.\n  * FraxBasePool you pair with FRAX-USDC, Frax doesn't keep what you help grow, doesn't keep CRV-CVX, they channel it back to you.\n  * Instead they build a network effect around the FraxBasePool as a Schelling point for liquidity, and give back proportional to demand for FBP by protocol.\n  * LPs earn yield just by using FraxBasePool, Frax not involved with other stablecoins, so no esoteric risk coming from other stables - only FRAX-USDC risk.\n* Timeline of FraxBasePool:\n  * Sam's been talking to Mitch (founder of Curve).\n  * Curve needs to deploy the FraxBasePool themselves.\n  * After team deploys, CurveDAO vote will allow FraxBasePool up as other option (aside from 3Pool).\n  * Second part of proposal is about whitelisting veCRV.\n  * Whitelisting will let Frax to permanently lock all FraxBasePool earnings that the protocol earns from its collateral and expansions (that don't go to other protocols as yield).\n  * Through this Frax can permanently vote FBP for the gauge weight etc. The more Frax can earn the more they can distribute to other protocols that pair.\n  * No more dumping CRV from FRAX - good for CVX and CRV since less sell pressure.\n* FRAX has good volume but not much velocity of money - to fix that they want to be a central liquidity locust, through FraxBasePool. FRAX will become high volume, high turnover money.\n* FRAX has historically been a good savings stablecoin, good yields, stable peg and has been lindy - doesn't have much velocity - which FraxBasePool and FraxLending will improve.\n\n### AMOs, Collateral Ratio, Decentralization Ratio & Doomsday Situation\n\n**AMOs**\n\n* When people mint FRAX into the new base pool/or put FRAX in there, they have to use USDC to mint that FRAX. That USDC comes into the Frax protocol. Frax takes that USDC and puts it into the AMOs.\n* The other direction can also happen. AMOs can mint and burn FRAX and move collateral (USDC). Someone can buy FRAX from Curve pool until curve pool is imbalanced then AMO can mint FRAX to balance it 50/50 and get LP tokens.\n\n**Collateral Ratio**\n\n* Collateral ratio is entirely backed by hard assets. Rest is FXS and other assets that aren't immediately liquid like vlCVX.\n* FRAX has a lot of locked liquidity in a lot of different places. If you take a deterministic analysis by looking at entire landscape of user owned FRAX and protocol owned FRAX you see that there cannot be a bank run right now.\n* Collateral ratio shows amount of FRAX backed by USDC (hard assets). Rest is backed by FXS and other volatile assets vlcvx.  One of the things in times of liquidity crisis/bank runs etc. if you take a full look at entire landscape of user owned frax etc.\n\n**Decentralization Ratio**\n\n* Decentralization ratio is amount of FRAX backed by completely non-custodial assets: non-fiat coins, not wBTC etc.\n* If FRAX is backed partially by DAI - DAI itself is 65% centralized assets. The ratio only counts decentralized version of DAI (because underlying DAI has claims on USDC etc.)\n\n**Doomsday situation**\n\n* If you simulate everything, FRAX is entirely deterministic, no Jump, no market makers, no collateral off-chain, what you see is what you get - everything is on-chain.\n* What if every single person farming FRAX pulled their Curve LP and dumped?\n* Currently it will not depeg. This is because there's a lot of locked liquidity and a lot of protocol owned liquidity.\n* Future depends on locked liquidity, how much debt denomination it has etc.\n\n### TradFi & Legislations\n\n* Sam thinks recent bill is bullish.\n\n**FRAX vs USDC, VISA et al.**\n\n* Its outside of FRAX's scope to try and do things off-chain.\n  * Doesn't want to incorporate a company and hold treasuries with Frax etc.\n* There will always be use for USDC or if Visa came out with a stablecoin or something. (something like BridgeFi)\n* But USDC will not build AMOs or AMM primitives like TWAMM etc. to integrate liquidity into protocols etc. They will be specialized for the requirement to hold treasuries and etc.\n* FRAX will be specialized to be the  predominant on-chain stablecoin, for everything on-chain.\n* Symbiotic relationship between USDC with Frax and Maker. It's not in Circle and Visa's wheelhouse to do certain stuff.\n* What if government says USDC must blacklist everything unless KYC?\n  * FRAX doesn't hold USDC it deploys it immediately into curve etc. USDC has to literally blacklist everything Curve Uniswap, Compound, AAVE etc.\n  * Sam doesn't think it's going in that direction. If it does go in that direction, to get to FRAX and Maker is to nuke everything - at that point they have bigger problems to worry about.\n* One of the biggest things was the surprising stance on stablecoins they want to keep a bit decentralized stablecoins, helps FRAX and DAI and FEI.\n* What FRAX is building is hard to replicate. Money is the strongest network effect. The more debt denominated/the more liquidity/the more others hold it which makes it harder to dislodge and coordinating a large group to hold it, creates the mother of all network effects.\n\n### FXS, Fraxswap and FraxLend\n\n**FXS**\n\n* FRAX - FXS is not just a mint and burn system.\n* The protocol earns a lot of revenue in CRV, CVX, soon from interest rates from FraxLend etc. and a lot of transaction fees.\n* Frax can buy back FXS if it's the best thing to do, if they know the governance token is highly undervalued compared to other assets on the balance sheet. Possibly buy back through TWAMM.\n\n**Fraxswap**\n\n* New UI, live on preview subdomains\n* Big vision and why they're actually building an AMM and a lending protocol around FXS:\n  * The way they look at it is that they have the concept of trinity:\n  * Every DeFi ecosystem/economy are formed of different flavours of lending, liquidity and currency, which means stablecoins, AMM and lending market.\n  * Many projects build stuff internally but don't go final 10% and make it a general infrastructural product. (i.e. projects already have a form of swap, but do not have a self-serve AMM that people can actually use and which will bring liquidity.)\n* FRAX wants to build this ecosystem strategically:\n  * If they're gonna spend weeks to create something that would allow them buy back FXS or contract supply of FRAX or rebalance collateral, they want to take a professional approach and build a new primitive.\n  * They're building a new AMM (with TWAMM functionality) called Fraxswap to purchase back FXS with protocol profit to be able to contract supply of FRAX, rebalance collateral etc.\n* You can TWAMM into any coin, not just FXS - you can create any pool against FXS. You don't have to create a FRAX pair. You can use any ERC-20 token.\n* TWAMM: User sets time period, every block during this period the user buys a small amount - essentially DCAing, buying small amounts over a period of time.\n* Fraxswap has a fee switch/admin switch that will distribute value to FXS holders.\n* How to bring liquidity into Fraxswap/TWAMM:\n  * TWAMM functionality will cater to large protocol owned liquidity.\n  * Additionally FXS gauges will be used. Anybody that uses Fraxswap for treasury rebalancing etc. they will get FXS gauges.\n  * How will they incentivize gauges?\n    * They will use redacted, pitch.money and votium in the future to earn bribes/incentives.\n* Sam doesn't want to be zero-sum competitors with Curve, they will still deploy largely to Curve. He thinks Fraxswap will be used for volatile pairs for protocols themselves that need to deploy liquidity and rebalance stuff.\n* Future Features:\n  * Through TWAMM, protocols can protect liquid backing by always slowly buying back into until price hits x over next y years and they get to buy low to get to a certain price.\n  * Custom curves. Currently Fraxswap is just regular xy=k curve but with TWAMMs. They're working on custom curves, concentrated liquidity and other unique projects.\n\n**Fraxlend**\n\n* Allows creation of isolated pairs with infinite customizability\n* Fully permissionless\n* Credit-based LTVs: You can create a pair where only whitelisted address of a DAO or individual (e.g. Tetranode) can borrow, and you can modify LTV for that specific pair.\n* It is essentially an entire framework for creating lending systems\n* Same idea of building strategically. You can mint FRAX on Fraxlend, loop and lend it back etc. Can essentially get leverage just like people were able to do with MIM.\n* Why are they doing so much?\n  * They are working/concentrating on FRAX, trying to build a professional and decentralized software, that allows more functionality - as opposed to building a limited/one-dimensional product.\n* Yields generated from Fraxlend would go to FXS holders.\n\n### Ecosystem, Keeping Up With Narratives, FPI & Long Term Vision\n\n**Ecosystem**\n\n* What do you want next for the Frax ecosystem?\n  * The more people build on the gauge ecosystem, the more vibrant the teams building on top of it, with primitives on top of base primitives etc.\n  * Frax's gauges are unique because people can lock the actual LP deposit for a period of time to get an extra boost. This is an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product as liquidity is locked\n  * Through Stax, Temple will take LP and lock for 3 years, tokenize the position and you can exit your locked tokenized position, while the liquidity is still locked, acting as an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product.\n\nThe system of locking LP tokens for increased boost is part of design. To kick start an algorithmic stablecoin it is important to have an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product. \n\n* You can only build this type of product on top of Frax currently, and Temple built a platform on top of this system.\n\nCould Convex do a similar Stax system: \n\n* If Stax becomes the second Convex for Frax, then Convex might adopt their system.\n\n**Keeping Up With Narratives**\n\n* Inside in crypto more than he sees sunlight, around the clock sitting here reading about stuff.\n* If he sees something new, what is it, is it new or fork/improvement?\n* If new is team doing it are they understanding intricacies?\n  * If yes he wants to talk to them and see if he can get involved\n* See where industry is going rather than following right now\n\n**FPI and Yields**\n\n* Frax cannot do something like Anchor etc. so they need to find sustainable, highest growth and attempt to join into new things at the base/start.\n* FPI is the second stablecoin, it's pegged to the CPI. It is an inflation resistant dollar. Grows and tracks the CPI.\n  * FRAX/FPI LP on Convex to earn FXS, Curve vAPY, CRV, CVX as well as FPI yields.\n* What do you mint against FPI:\n  * FPI protocol needs to grow backing at inflation rate or more.\n  * When Fraxlend comes out, users can borrow against FPI or borrow FPI, which will go towards the FPI balance sheet, keeping it collateralized.\n\n**Long Term Vision of FRAX**\n\n* Sam wants to build a full stack/complete economy around FRAX and the new FPI:\n  * Complete economy: lending, liquidity and currency - (stablecoins, AMM and lending market and debt denomination)\n* After a full stack economy is built, then they can think about a potential Frax Roll Up - to capture value of the block space and etc.\n* Unlike Terra they want to build economy first and then build a roll-up, not start as an L1.\n* If block space is valuable enough for people to pay fees, \"months and months from now\", might end up with own Frax Chain or Roll-Up.\n\n## Sam Kazemian on The Defiant\n\n### Current Situation:\n\n* Tough macroeconomic situation.\n* Confidence of stablecoins down and FRAX only 17 months old so relatively new.\n* With stablecoins it's difficult because essentially you spend all your time stabilizing a token to a dollar, just so that it works every time people need to flee to stablecoins\n* They're trying to develop Lindy effects to make sure that they have a stablecoin that is actually being used when there's a flight to safety\n* Proud that FRAX kept peg when everything was de-pegged - happy to be able to develop confidence and Lindy effect similar to DAI and USDC\n\n### Lindy Effect:\n\n* Resilience of protocol acquired over time\n* Why does Sam care about Lindy Effect much?\n* Lindy Effect is social phenomenon that longer something is around, the higher the chance it sticks around\n* Lindy Effect in stablecoins is much longer\n* Longer stablecoin stays at peg, the longer people will think it will survive, which is why it's particularly important for stablecoins.\n\n### How to build Lindy Effect:\n\n* FRAX and DAI or Maker have no competition/issues. FRAX wants sustainable and developing yield, and Maker is not interested in that - one is not necessarily better than the other.\n* Sam wants deep liquidity, use for sustainable LP'ing and staking in Curve.\n  Thinks UST wanted to be similar to FRAX, a fractional algorithmic currency, because it's a more resilient model\n  Terra wanted to be more like FRAX but they never managed to get their collateral ratio high enough\n\n### Depegging and Collateralization:\n\n* Stablecoins need a lot of exogenous collateral\n  FRAX is highly collateralized, and people say isn't that like a fully backed stablecoin\n  FRAx needs to be highly collateralized since it is quite young, it should be 90% backed, it cannot be a fiat like currency yet, it's only 17 months old.\n  That's why they have been trying to be similar to DAI, to have lots of hard-backed collateral, to lower bank-run chances and reflexivity\n* The only similarity FRAX currently has to algorithmic stablecoins is the name, right now it's not necessarily algorithmic\n* FRAX kind of passed the test of terrible market conditions.\n\n### Full Stack Economy:\n\n* They want to constantly improve, it will never be a finished product\n* They've been building 24/7, they want to build the FRAX full stack economy.\n  A full permissionless economy, with TWAMM and FRAXSwap\n  TWAMM - a good system for protocol owned liquidity: allows balancing large amounts of collateral and making large market orders\n  Can also be used like Uniswap V2.\n* Essentially building a full economy around FRAX and using FXS, not a random bunch of tokens.\n  Want to create liquidity and capture value, debt denominated in your own infrastructure, like Maker and CDP and DAI\n  Full DeFi stack\n  Lending, liquidity and currency\n  When things are good, traditionally stablecoins don't have much velocity and have low fees\n  Which is why they need to find ways to generate velocity and fees\n* Use cases of money: store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange\n  * FRAX has been a good store of value, but they want to have more trading pairs and debt denominated in it (loans), to make sure that they satisfy all use cases of money - to capture value.\n\n### Buyback and UST Aftermath:\n\n* They make 80 million dollars in annual revenue, they want to buy back 20 million of FXS using TWAMM.\n* They are proposing it now, because FXS has been hit hard, harder than most bc of stablecoin confidence.\n* FXS lost a lot of value, not just because of market conditions, but also because of general distrust of stablecoins after UST depeg/Luna disaster.\n* It's not always good to buyback and burn governance token, you want to increase balance sheet, put it towards growth etc.\n* However, if the market misprices (according to us), the token and is undervalued, compared to other tokens that could be bought and put on the balance sheet.\n* Logically, the most useful thing to do is buyback and retire the governance tokens. They think that FXS is undervalued, and it's the best use of protocol profits. FXS dropped 38 ATH to 6.38. FRAX is creating revenue, it's a resilient protocol, going to have more rev bc of swap and lending.\n\n### Marketing and FRAX:\n\n* How has FRAX decided to talk to Yellen and convince about FRAX.\n* They have different ethos for marketing: everything is provable on-chain: FRAX team is just 8 to 9 engineers, no marketing team, DeFi focused. There's a lot of FUD, they're not interested on twitter and don't want to convince to be believed, they're on chain and transparent\n* They have shown that they are protected from a bank run because of amount of liquidity and locked liquidity and integrations FRAX wouldn't depeg due to current collateral ratio, they can see, everyone can see because we're on chain and transparent. Maybe we made a mistake go verify it.\n* 46 million FRAX can still be printed and expanded and would still be impossible to bank run. They run internal tests and are meticulous about keeping it all on-chain, no CEX and market maker relationships - just like Maker. Everything is in smart contracts, there marketing is the tech and keep it on-chain.\n\n### Fraxswap and Curve Competition:\n\n* One of the biggest proposals recently is the FraxBasePool:\n  Closest thing to risk-free, because it's with USDC\n  They will essentially own part of Curve as they grow with it. They want to become their meta stable coin, since Curve cannot issue their own stablecoin.\n  They're collaborative, they just want to grow the whole DeFi pie, no competition, no value lost, gain value from both of them.\n\n### Basket of assets that back the stablecoin:\n\n* Some curve LP tokens lower volatility, some WBTC and ETH\n  They're looking to increase volatile assets that back FRAX, especially during bear market where prices are down. Good time to increase with profits and not with seigniorage to not take asymmetric risks), to create a resilient and strong peg.\n* Increasing ETH exposure/backing would also allow FRAX to expand the ability for Frax PoS staking service, a Frax ETH derivative of sorts like Lido.\n  It makes sense to have Frax have the ability to have proof of stake validator infrastructure issue 1:1 FRAX/ETH derivative that can back FRAX. Essentially create more value.\n\n### Future:\n\n* Sam has been in the industry 7-8 years. They don't do stuff for the fun of it, they want to consider what will stuff look like in a year? How to get their incrementally?\n* The staked Lido type system not for profit, they're building full stack economy:\n* If they're gonna have liquidity, lending and currency, the last part of that is the actual network, the blockspace, to own a piece of the blockchain, and participate.\n* To make the FRAX economy the largest consensus forming Schelling points, to capture the value of those transaction fees.\n\n### Real World Assets:\n\n* Terrible time to take real world risks, but good time to build relationships and infrastructure when things turn around\n* They're currently working with goldfinch etc. to talk about how they can do real world lending through them, but market conditions are not great.\n* They agree with Maker guys on real world assets:\n  If you're going to have debt denominated in your stablecoin, you need the actual stablecoin to issue credit and debt for actual economic activity, not just degenerate behaviour.\n  There's actually a real use case for DeFi, if FRAX and Maker will ever scale to trillion dollars of supply, there has to be real economic lending in the real world.\n  Hopefully will become a less risky endeavour in a better market value\n\n### Algorithmic Stablecoin Definition and Current Prognosis for USD:\n\n* The outdated algorithmic stablecoin old system doesn't work.\n* Volatile governance token being used to stabilize the other token created out of thin air doesn't work. \n* FRAX premise was just that: it doesn't work, we need exogenous collateral, only small amounts of algorithmic. \n* They need to build Lindy and almost entirety of it needs to be backed by assets.\n\n### Whats Sam's prognosis for USD?\n\n* USD doesn't look great. \n* What FRAX is working on is the FPI.\n* Pegged to the CPI, inflation resistant dollar. \n* Current unit of account of world is USD, 80%+ trade is denominated in it.\n* Whatever will be successor has to be self-sovereign peg or some other stablecoin that has a stability to a basket of assets humans care about.\n* Three trillion dollar narratives: BTC, ETH and Stablecoins.", "timestamp": 1658586165, "digest": "24N0RjNZ7KKwhocH7ws4-fqBOXWQ7-roxGmenOnjwS4", "contributor": "0xfF8Fa9737169903FEb053d6320d7088cF6EC861B"}

{"id": "M1JJG4n93xkOA_esut7gp9GImB4U1fNpmMTTTuNu-mQ", "title": "Vitamin Sea with extra Foam ", "body": "![Credit: OnClickCloset, IANA and Artisant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lxlvw9VobcsUwvcmj6FZW.jpg?height=722&width=722)\n\nBorn south of the equator, I’m no stranger to underwater adventures and surfing the tide. In the metaverse, I frequently visit digital Atlantica and pay my respects to Ariel, the Little Mermaid. And, on rare occasions, she lets me raid her subaqueous wardrobe filled with gleaming gowns and pearly tiaras. \n\nBut resurfacing from these nautical dreams means I need to morph back into my human self and lose my glimmering tail. Much like how the sea’s tides brush the shores as foam, I leave the last drop of seawater as a mermaid and walk the beach transformed again into a woman.\n\nThe idea of this transformation, change and amphibian metamorphosis is encapsulated in a digital fashion collection launched by OnClickCloset and IANA called SEA FOAM. \n\nFrom gorgeous shape-shifting gowns to elegant sea treasures in the form of jewellery, this digital fashion line is a delicately intricate symbiosis between the ever-lasting mysterious beauty of our oceans and our intrinsic connection to them.\n\n“The SEA FOAM Digital Collection of NFT wearables, shoes and jewellery is about the metamorphosis of shapes when one colour merges with another creating a unique and ambiguous pattern,” OnClickCloset and IANA explain on the [Artisant’s site](https://artisant.io/users/0x609cdc763e4f44f03050aa55f38a641e9fb31b90) - the marketplace where the digital fashion garments being sold (digital jewellers Jevels are host to the jewellery aspect of the collection which can be found [here](https://jevels.com/collections/vendors?q=OnClickCloset%20and%20Iana)). \n\n“The main concept of the collection is the natural unpredictability and mystery of water, its hues, and shadows. The SEA FOAM collection is a tribute to abstract art and its deep connection with the natural beauty of life. \n\nThe prints used for the collection are the acrylic paintings of the British painter, sculptor, and writer Peter Bear.”\n\nI was fortunate enough to win the NFT competition hosted by the designers and Glitch Mag to own the digital fabric of these garments (what are the odds, right?). Observing the patterns alone, it’s clear the detail and colour tones literally mirror that of an aquamarine glare of an ocean’s vibrant movement. I’m sure Ariel would be jealous…\n\nOf course, the entire SEA FOAM collection is stunning in my opinion but I selected 3 standout pieces that genuinely caught my eye.\n\n## ABYSS\n\n![Credit: OnClickCloset, IANA and Artisant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i26uF7qF0ybigEYmrvcV4.jpg?height=620&width=1102)\n\nWith wispy flowing sea glass sleeves flowing, the ABYSS dress has a graceful air about it. The high-thigh slit, plunging neckline and the bold print that sends you into blissful hypnosis (the more you stare at it), exude a royalty. \n\nThe final touch is the elegant ABYSS choker that looks like drops of translucent seawater.  “It gives you the hypnotic feeling of starting a journey into the abyssal waters with its mystical fairy tales,” OnClickCloset and IANA. \n\n“As you start looking at the print, you lose yourself falling into infinite alternations of paint. This is why the dress is called ABYSS.”\n\n## PEARL HEELS\n\n![Credit: OnClickCloset, IANA and Artisant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bPf1rtTz4eBw5r64J0Vm9.jpg?height=1433&width=1075)\n\nDeep-blue velvet tone coupled with a glistening pearl border, these PEARL HEELS will easily elevate any digital outfit (ant just literally). The stiletto heel adds that extra dash of seduction to a classic style of shoe.

Web3 数据存储的两种选择 \n 04/ Tableland 原理分析 \n 05/ 总结\n\n\n---\n\n## 背景介绍\n\n在当下市场环境下新发 NFT 项目并且达到 0.5 ETH 的地板价及上千 ETH 交易量，确实可以称为明星项目。\n\nTableland 是 NFT 项目吗？是的，但它又是不只是 NFT 项目，Tableland 号称要做原生 web3 的关系表。\n\n好多人来问我：“陈老师，这个叫 Tableland 的项目到底能不能买，听着好像技术很牛，买两个会涨吗？”\n\n貌似这个行业技术创新是推动 NFT 价格上涨的一个有效催化剂，比如 Azuki、Gh0stlyGh0st 等，但是今天我肯定不会讲这个 NFT 项目本身，而是来聊聊 Tableland 背后的技术驱动原理到底是怎么一回事，聊一聊为什么称它为一个很“鸡贼”的项目，注意在本文中鸡贼没有贬义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3CmLipBWvzsYuNwTUQWrB.png?height=530&width=1080)\n\n*\\*说明：如果你恰好看过 Vic Talk 的视频，请不要误会本文抄袭。Vic 是我的好朋友，我之前协助他对 Tableland 项目进行了分析，故本文会存在内容与其视频重合，特此说明避免读者产生不必要的误会。*\n\n## Web3 原生的关系表\n\n因为目前该项目公开查到的资料比较少，所以本文主要以阅读其官方文档并给予一定的解读和推演，可能存在一定程度的局限性。\n\n首先直接打开其官方文档，我们可以看到它称自己是 web3 原生的关系表。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QQO4QsOtmTnZw0R0Ycl59.png?height=269&width=1080)\n\n这里面临一个对于普通人而言比较陌生的词汇：“关系表”。\n\n我们平时使用的大部分软件背后都有一个数据库用来存储使用过程中产生的数据，这些数据都会以“表”的形式存储，你可以简单将其理解为 Excel。\n\n关系表是什么？举个例子，比如美团外卖会有商家和用户这两个角色，也可以称之为实体。那么就需要有两个表分别存储商家和用户这两类角色的信息。\n\n* 商家表：店名、电话、地址、营业时间等\n* 用户表：姓名、性别、住址等\n\n在表中，每一“行”就是一个具体的商家或者用户，每一“列”则是它对应的属性即姓名、地址等。\n\n表中还有一个很重要的列，就是 ID。每个商家和用户都会有一个 ID 来标识唯一性，这个 ID 称之为主键，就像是身份证一样，这样即使有同名的也可以区分出来。\n\n关系表顾名思义就是表和表之间是相关联的。比如，当我们思考商家和用户如何关联起来，第一时间想到的就是订单。当一个用户给某个商家下了一份订单，于是他们两之间就产生了关联。\n\n同样的也有一个表来存储所有的订单信息，每一行就是一个订单，每一列则是其属性，包括下单人、接单商家、下单时间、金额等等。\n\n这时候你会发现，这个订单里一定会有两个属性分别要存储商家与用户这两个角色，一般来说就是会把刚才说到的 ID 存进去，比如下单人的 ID 为 666，那我在订单表中进行查找时，看到一个叫 666 的订单，于是我就可以去用户表中检索 ID 为 666 的用户找到其具体信息。\n\n为了让大家更直观的理解，粗糙的画了一张示例图，分别为用户表、商家表和订单表，当然在实际的生产开发过程中表的设计肯定不会这样粗糙，按照这样的表设计也肯定是执行不起来的，只是为了让大家更易于理解，此处请勿杠。   \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oeFVKYf6nGNS1VHfR9q7L.png?height=491&width=1080)\n\n现在你明白什么叫关系表了吧。所以 Tableland 为什么说自己要做 Web3 原生的关系表呢？我们接着往下看。\n\n## Web3 数据存储的两种选择\n\n它提出了目前 web3 数据存储的问题是项目方有被迫有两种选择，要么是把所有的数据存在链上，不过这样 gas 肯定就炸了，而且链上数据结构也支撑不了我刚才给大家画的那种表关联的复杂结构，另一种则是混合存储，即一部分存在链上，一部分在链下，比如 NFT 则是把 NFT 的 ID、持有人等存在链上，而 NFT 的图片、属性等信息存在链下，可以放在 IPFS ，也甚至可以放在阿里云...\n\n不过这个问题确实是存在的，我之前写的文章提到过如阿狸这种奇怪的项目可以直接把用户的 metadata  给改了的操作。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S-MZYN76r3Xp9_SOjbT8_.png?height=330&width=1080)\n\n## Tableland  原理分析\n\n首先其实看到 Tableland 也不是纯链，而是将区块链、去中心化存储（还是在链下）等揉在了一起。可以看到图中有三层结构：\n\n* 第一层是表现层：\n\n  用户和前端的 NFT、DAO、Dapp 等进行交互\n* 第二层是业务层：\n\n  用来管理和鉴别所有权、数据交互以及计算\n* 第三层是数据层：\n\n  用来存取数据\n\n其实这样看也没啥，很常规的三层架构，所以其在架构上是没有什么革命性创新的。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-a4Lj_9konP8xif8Gosr-.png?height=602&width=1080)\n\n那我们再耐下心看看它的实现逻辑，它将数据库分为两部分，链上的访问控制 ACL 和链下存储表。\n\nACL 是啥呢？就是对组织身份角色权限的管理，谁有权限做什么事，所以按照它的说法是把这个管理放在了链上。然后正儿八经的数据存储还是在链下，只是相比于传统的多加了一道 ACL 的过程。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bxxwQAnaMj94hlmxjOiUw.png?height=256&width=1080)\n\n举个例子易于清晰理解，以前我做一套 NFT，把合约发上去后，然后把图片存在 IPFS，IPFS 是去中心化存储的，里面本身的内容不可修改，我如果想改就必须在合约留个后门，从而我可以重新发一套 IPFS 文件，然后把合约指向的链接替换了。\n\n但是现在我可以在合约与 IPFS 中间加一层 ACL，去设置某些人可以增删改查某些数据。通过这张图也可以看到，用户是和合约先进行交互，检查其 ACL 与 owner 权限，然后合约将增删改查的请求发送给 Tableland 进行处理，图里还是描述的很简单的这里看不出很多细节。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BHHTlIQreJ8VXwWM1sxk1.png?height=306&width=1080)\n\n这里重点来了，为什么我说它是一个“鸡贼”的项目呢？就是因为下面这句话，它的每个表都是一套 ERC721 的 NFT，妙，实在是妙啊！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c-c-1i9x_65HtIfIw6_5Q.png?height=126&width=1080)\n\n到了这里你可能会有点懵，每个表是一套 ERC721 的 NFT ，这代表什么呢？\n\n还记得我一开始花了很大力气讲的关系表概念吗？每个表是一类实体，每一行就是具体的一个实体，每一列就是这个实体的属性，并且会有一列 ID 用来标识该实体的唯一性。\n\n我们想想 NFT，每个 NFT 都是独一无二的原因就是因为有着从1～9999的 tokenID 去标识唯一性，然后每个 NFT 又会有自己的 metadata 用来存储它的名字、描述、图片等信息，这从性质上不就是一个“表”吗？\n\n只是之前的这套 NFT 存储方式不是以表的结构进行存储的，我画张草图易于理解，下图为目前 NFT 存储的结构，链上存了 ID 与持有人，链下则存了 metadata 对应着每个NFT的具体信息。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Nd8jKMulSZ6gm8MLi7oVk.png?height=694&width=1010)\n\n我们将其数据结构按照表的形式进行整理如下图所示，可见 ERC721 的 NFT 天然就是一张表呀！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/siVXaW9DEqnvJrkRKlsAD.png?height=274&width=694)\n\n所以 Tableland 巧妙的利用 NFT 的特性，将其链上表，如 ACL 等访问控制的方式都用 NFT 来解决，相当于每张表都是一套 NFT，这很巧妙是不是！巧妙到我用“鸡贼”来形容它。\n\n我们再来看一个它给出的更完整的逻辑交互图，总共有4方，首先用户和前端进行交互，我们先看左边，对网关发起了查询请求，然后网管转发给 Tableland 后返回给数据，因为链上数据本来都公开所以查询这个路径没有什么特别的。\n\n我们看右边的修改与写入数据的路径，对智能合约发起请求，然后 dapp 自身的合约与 Tableland 的合约进行鉴权，通过后发给 Tableland 进行数据处理，这里有趣的是它引入了传统的 SQL 来做数据处理，从而能够以极低的上手门槛吸引开发者进入。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qu7z5rYVQo0lunZAePHUd.png?height=1097&width=1080)\n\n## 总结\n\n以上就是对于 Tableland 这个项目的原理分析，我不评价其解决方案的优劣性，更不评价其 NFT 的投资价值，单纯从原理来看我觉得还是挺有趣的，用了取巧的方式，也在一定程度上可以解决目前 Web3 开发数据存储中所牵扯的很多杂七杂八的问题，至少是一个 buidl 行业的一步，值得鼓励！\n\n\n---\n\nBuidler DAO 聚集顶尖的 Web3

{"id": "3dYuoO04YFSy6acrUTSdspHqLwZUNbAk41U72IztyAg", "title": "创作者经济4.0初探", "body": "2022年年初，经由CSS播客第10集[《共创“拥有者经济”——LiJin》](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/61fcbcd50c35c9f95dca171c)，我第一次接触到创作者经济4.0的概念。\n\n> *Li Jin 将创作者经济的演变描述为 4 个不同阶段。以下是各个阶段的简短描述：*\n>\n> *创作者经济 1.0：由于互联网的诞生，个人可以成为创作者。*\n>\n> *创作者经济 2.0：创作者利用自己在平台上的影响力，通过广告和品牌赞助实现盈利。*\n>\n> *创作者经济 3.0：创作者成为独立的企业，并直接从他们的粉丝那里获得盈利。主要探讨：热情经济 (Passion Economy)、如何构建一个创作者中产阶级、100个真正的粉丝以及加密货币扮演的角色。*\n>\n> *创作者经济 4.0：创作者和他们的粉丝共同创造和积累财富。这是我们对未来创作者者经济的一瞥。*\n\n关于如何体现“经济”属性、“商业模式”，个人做了一个简单的个人理解总结：\n\n1\\.0：单向输出盈利模式不明；\n\n2\\.0：靠积攒流量获得广告费及粉丝打赏等；\n\n3\\.0：经营个体品牌，粉丝直接为内容付费；\n\n4\\.0：基于Web3，围绕个体创作者形成社区DAO，共同创造与拥有。\n\n创作者经济4.0一个关键点在于社区，Web3领域同样重度依赖社区的是NFT项目，这样的交叉似乎为一个隔三差五被提起的问题找到了答案：除了小图片买买卖卖，NFT的应用场景有哪些？\n\n除了老生常谈的游戏道具，pass卡门票（alpha社区、共创项目准入）、票据凭证（DeFi场景）、e-mail邮票、纪念奖章（参加活动、众筹募捐） ……创作者经济4.0的表现形式之——Web3内容共创场景也许是可以探索的方向。\n\n当然，正如LiJin所言，创作者与其粉丝共创共赚，只是我们对未来创作者经济的一瞥，表现形式有很多。但是光共创共赚这一点，就足够我们去挖掘、去畅想。以下是一些初探的碎片拾遗：\n\n## 把我们带进兔子洞的2个项目\n\n### Shibuya\n\n沿着那个隔三差五会被问到的问题，我们先谈谈Shibuya。在Bankless的一期访谈视频 [Alpha Leak丨Shibuya颠覆好莱坞工作室](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYAPkc29-A&t=2914s&ab_channel=Bankless) 中，去中心化的视频发行/分发平台Shibuya联合创始人pplpleasr说，他们在尝试探索NFT在PFP以外的应用场景。Shibuya上首部自主制作的动画《White Rabbit》总共分为7个章节，目前已经来到第二章，每个章节项目方都会发行一款制片人NFT（ERC1155），社区成员观看完剧情之后以手持的NFT对接下来的剧情走向进行投票（官推说集齐7个NFT有惊喜）。\n\n![第一章的剧情选择画面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fxQ565kHfJmNjvPjJ9up2.png?height=463&width=825)\n\n![影片结束时，制片人名单显示的是以太坊地址或者ENS](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pe0aL_g5hkecxMucIIvsA.png?height=1822&width=3701)\n\n除了影响剧情走向，这些制片人NFT还能决定社区成员获得整部动画碎片化所有权的多少：在统计完投票结果之后社区成员解押NFT可以获得$WRAB代币奖励，越早投票、投中票数最高的剧情走向可获得的奖励越多。最后，整部动画制作完毕后，$WRAB会转化为碎片化NFT。作品后续怎么发展，比如是否要卖给别的流媒体平台，均由社区投票决定。\n\n作为新的尝试，除了代币激励、共同拥有一部作品的预期，Shibuya用什么方法加强社区的参与度呢？寻宝彩蛋环节算是其中之一。第一章的彩蛋是把藏有4个NFT（均由shibuya团队成员创作）的一个地址的助记词，以文字、图画形式分布散落在影片的不同部分，让观众去收集；第二章就直接一点，选择中间空投的礼物，即可得到空投的NFT「Something Cooking」，这个NFT用途尚未明确，会不会在后续环节里能用得上？\n\n![助记词寻宝答案，前1、2个单词在上图1的两扇门上方](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XsqP99AS6T5IDCt-8u9uo.png?height=1246&width=784)\n\n说到互动式视频，可能大家会想起《黑镜——潘达斯奈基》，同样也是互动式视频的噱头，但是这种互动，是一种可以以上帝视角窥探全貌的方式，所有的剧情走向选择其实都在制作方Netflix的预设中。归根结底还是制作方书写好一切，观众是被动接受内容的一方。当然，黑镜也是有很有趣的彩蛋环节，不知道White Rabbit是不是受启发于此呢？\n\n![来自知乎的《黑镜——潘达斯奈基》剧情整理](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cTSLljx_G6Ntg5vhbgEyp.png?height=2048&width=1772)\n\n更多的White Rabbit拉片影评，可以看看这篇文章[《White Rabbit-Web 3的黑客帝国不缺头号玩家》](https://mirror.xyz/0x1F4341E7b8aC0d3C4f2228F2a5503C2338a4D6C1/VRVtk7IO4Vqo_2PKuyoSMIT7a0VU9LQwi4diGg9cvuE)\n\n### Mad Realities\n\n社区/内容消费者/观众参与到内容创作，还有另外一个例子，Web3版相亲综艺Proof of Love，其背后的平台Mad Realities，于今年4月获得Paradigm 600万美元的投资。如果说在Shibuya的情景里，观众只是简单地投个票，并未真正体现“创作”二字，Proof of Love的设定则是给到了观众更大的发挥创意的空间与参与度。Proof of Love发行了3款玫瑰NFT作为参与门票，分别是0.1ETH、0.5ETH、1ETH。NFT持有者可以参与选角，从男女嘉宾到主持人都是经过投票产生，他们还可以参与剧本策划、拍摄过程一些情节的干预（比如给看好的一对送上饮料），最高档NFT持有者还能亲临拍摄现场。每集制作完毕，该集都会被铸造成1/1的NFT到ZORA平台上进行拍卖，拍卖获得的资金30%作为大奖给到季末牵手成功的人，10%作为下一集的奖励（每集最后被相中的嘉宾不想牵手，可以赢取奖金），40%进入DAO财库，还有15%由拍卖所得者决定去向。不考虑Web3、Crypto元素，这部完全可以作为搞笑综艺来看看。\n\n关于Mad Realties更多信息可以参考《[爱情证明——DAO版非诚勿扰](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HNYvIlqeOfteueYHjNdcIQ)》\n\n![参与爱情证明的3档NFT Pass，共募集到172.71ETH，holder人数为390](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Geta_LjuhP9TKGUHIXl9f.png?height=976&width=1902)\n\n一开始我是因为彩蛋、内容搞笑好玩关注到这2个例子，并在社交媒体简单写了下玩法、在Web3随意门播客里提及了一些细节。后面陆续有听众小伙伴给给我安利、投喂他们发现的Web3内容共创项目，我开始有意识地收集这一类的项目尝试做一个mapping，并且有一种感觉：这可能很快就会遍地开花，也许已经是了……这个安利、投喂，帮助我们发现更多共创项目的过程，似乎也是某种意义上的共创。\n\n## Web3共创Mapping\n\n![图片来源：Web3随意门社区整理](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lPKysT-RWurssaglvDqAk.png?height=829&width=1057)\n\n为什么这个mapping会以故事创作为核心呢？因为根据目前不完全的项目统计，发现大多是围绕创作一个故事展开的，只是形式各异，有文字、图画、音频、视频等，还有的是各种形式的复合，比如想要打造一个去中心化好莱坞的Story DAO。还有一些共创项目，其主线并不是要创作故事，这些项目就放在了故事创作圈以外。\n\n目前还有2个项目数量众多的共创大类，没有收录进来，一个是基于PFP NFT的二创，仅以创作饱满度较高的Jenkins the Valet作为代表，Jenkins是以BAYC为原型创作的男仆故事。未来创造（二创）力更蓬勃的领域可能集中在cc0性质的项目上（[Web3随意门播客以典型的cc0鼻祖级项目之一的Nouns为例展开了讨论](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/62d00eac92f0689a31f500bd?s=eyJ1IjoiNjBmNTk1ZjFlMGY1ZTcyM2JiODgxYzY3In0%3D)，关于cc0可能在创造文化符号带来创作者经济繁荣的创想，后续另开一篇文章来探讨）；另外，以更广义的角度来定义“内容创作”，品牌创意也可以视为Web3内容共创的一个分类，体现为Web3+消费，相关的项目：意图打造Web3版雀巢的[gmgn supply](https://www.gmgnsupply.co/)、“Web3+消费”孵化器[CPG](https://www.cpgd.xyz/)。\n\n以上的mapping是比较狭义的Web3内容共创，在这些示例中，均有一个重要的角色——NFT，NFT 是故事本身的载体、元素或角色，以及参与创作的准入Pass卡。\n\n### 播客\n\nReHash Podcast是由Diana Chen在[Mirror上发起](https://rehash.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0xa3659D161757C6c88e667CC022B93bcCfa01dB27)的“社区驱动的Web3播客”，持有ReHash NFT的社区成员可以提名和投票选出最喜欢的嘉宾、话题等方面来共同创建播客。ReHash原计划募集10ETH，最终募集到29.53ETH。Diana Chen 启动ReHash之前，全职主持过[The Unstoppable Podcast](https://the-unstoppable-podcast.simplecast.com/) 和DAOn the Rabbit Hole两档播客，共计200多场，其中150场与Web3相关。\n\n![图片来源：ReHash discord治理频道](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H5OQHfa5_qatOBgKtn-IO.png?height=625&width=747)\n\n在ReHash的discord 治理频道，可以看到ReHash想做的不仅仅是一档共创播客节目，它希望以DAO的形式，凝聚社区力量，发展出教育中心、知识枢纽、支持团体、媒体出版物、播客孵化器等，ReHash称“可能性是无穷的”。ReHash Podcast是Rehash DAO的第一个项目，类似于Mad Realities的综艺视频只是起点。\n\n为什么要做互动式播客？ReHash表达了他们的价值观: 如果希望更多不同的群体从Web3受益，就要尽可能多地表达不同观点，需要提名少数派、背景各异的播客嘉宾，以尊重、富有同理心的态度去倾听他们的声音；世界（包括Web3）不是非黑即白的，灰色地带中有一些细微之处值得拿出来讨论，而不是简单地给事物贴个标签。\n\n社区参与带来了什么不同？ReHash的播客是12集为一季，第一期在发起共创计划之前制作好，选题偏小众而杂（个人感受，也可能是我涉猎范围有限），比如帮助出狱犯人走上正轨避免再次入狱的NFT项目、DeFi教育者/实习生的访谈等；而来到第二季，社区提名并确定下来的嘉宾基本来自知名Web3项目，比如Gitcoin、DAO Haus、Kernel、AAVE、Zora等。\n\n由ReHashDAO作一点延伸的联想：作为DAO闲逛者，我觉得也许内容共创会是小而美型DAO的发展方向之一。\n\n目前我们可以看到有大而全DAO，比如BanklessDAO；另外还有找到自己利基点的小而美DAO，比如以促进Web3从业者心理健康为目标的Twoplus，以及众多有着明确创作目标的小团体。大而全的DAO里，人才聚到同一个场里做无规则“布朗运动”，看看能碰撞处什么机会，随机属性强。小而美DAO一开始有着较为聚焦的项目，先做出产品或者作品，由此吸引更多参与者，从而扩大社区规模。这里不去探讨两种方式的长短优劣。我们发现Web3创作型小项目的roadmap或者定位中都有DAO化的考量。小而美的DAO有很多种类，互动式创作项目很可能是promising的类型之一。其实Shibuya在官方推文里也提过这样的构思：一部电影就是一个DAO。\n\n![图片来源：BanklessDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xg9fMWthSqMEfs6kmjwD1.png?height=976&width=1545)\n\n### 音乐\n\nSongCamp办了3期营地活动（音乐创作黑客松）：Genesis、Elektra、Chaos。其中第三期Chaos主打“无头乐队（headless band）”概念。其中“无头”借鉴了应用研究机构 Other Internet 于2019年10月首次提出的术语“无头品牌（headless brand）”——其价值观、信仰、叙事和符号是由支持者以分布式、无需许可的方式确定的，而不是自上而下地定义或强化的品牌，典型的“无头品牌”例子就是比特币。\n\n![图片来源：SongCamp](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BQoTKAFPPjRZgjihCv7bl.png?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n严格来说，Chaos它跟上面提到的团队+社区的共创还不算是同一种类型。Chaos是把77位没有合作基础的创作者（音乐人45人、视觉艺术创作者9人、运营/操作员7人、工程师6人、广播制作人5人、经济学家3人、文案知识大师2人）聚合到一起，创作出45首音乐及21000个唱片封面（由1000多个视觉图层交替变化组合）。\n\n这77个专业创作者更像是一个专业团队的共创，即这77人视为一个团队，并没有开放创作空间给到社区、NFT购买者。这一点在NFT的权益上体现得最为明显，上述的45首音乐结合封面形成了21000个NFTNFT，其中20000万用于对外出售，剩下1000个按照比例（这个比例由各人持有的CHAOS代币决定，其中CHAOS的数量根据成员“自评+互评+调整”的分数决定，CHAOS代币的30%进入songcamp国库）分给77位创作者，将来作品产生的任何收益，只有那1000个NFT的持有者可以享受收益的分成。因此，即便是“共同拥有”，也只是77位创作者共同拥有。\n\n音乐NFT研究组织Water&Music指出，CHAOS这种形式的共创，创新意义在于，拥抱一种思维模式：把金融轨道的重要性提到和创意同样高的水平，金融创新本身也是创作的一部分，以及实践出了一个Web3音乐创作的蓝图。这里的金融，我个人理解为协调众人进行协作，在创作早期就谈论艺术品的财务价值，并（与0xSplit协议合作）设计出一套基于NFT的自动对收益进行分账的系统。\n\n![根据water&music报告整理](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WNO7a8M96WC3F-LLA48Q2.png?height=1006&width=3652)\n\n至于为什么会把SongCamp的例子也放在故事创作圈内？Chaos所讲述的并不是一个具象化的故事，但在设定上，是为围绕一个抽象的故事主线来创作音乐：第一幕，秩序；第二幕，混乱；第三幕，熵；第四幕，重生。为什么要创作故事？和在SeeDAO中主导water&music报告翻译的Henry的交流中，他分享了以下观点和信息：那些做音乐的时候动不动先搞个故事的，后续是要围绕故事这个核心展开一些玩法的，比如漫画书、现场音乐会，至于搞到哪一步就看意愿和资金了。\n\n### 视频\n\n视频（含动画）类项目，基本玩法是由项目方设定基本框架、世界观，然后观众参与内容贡献与投票决定情节走向。除了上面谈到的Proof of Love和White Rabbit，还有动画Stoner Cats，以及模仿Stoner Cats玩法、在Solana链上发行的摔跤手共创故事the Gimmick。和White Rabbit有点不一样的是，Stoner Cat需要买了NFT才能看动画内容。\n\n虽说在这些项目里，NFT 持有人将能够对其中一些故事进行投票和共同创作，但是像我这样的走马观花太多项目、灵感也不是那么爆棚的人来说，还真是提供不了什么创意（掩脸）……\n\n早前一篇[探讨社区自下而上创作故事的文章](https://www.defidaonews.com/article/6676940)还罗列了更多视频、文字类的共创项目，感兴趣的小伙伴可以探索一下。\n\nShibuya曾经发过一个推，戏称它们正在升级品牌为NFTFLIX（第一眼是不是看成了NETFLIX？这是要挑战NFTFLIX？），引入互动、共创元素，能为传统的内容创作平台带来什么不同？Web3内容共创，到底是玩家们一时兴起的一波流尝试，还是一个有潜力的Web3发展方向？这些问题，可能仍待我们边观察边找答案。\n\n![图片来源：Shibuya推特](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X0yTAFEslC-85tkGMNAuP.png?height=829&width=967)\n\n### 文字\n\nJenkins The Valet是比较典型的文字类去中心化创作项目。化名为Jenkins的成员在2021年5月22日买下了1798号无聊猿，为其命名为Jenkins the Valet（贴身男仆Jenkins），并围绕其创作故事，尝试去中心化的创意写作。买下了无聊猿的第二天，他就写下了简单的5/600字的故事起源作为背景（一只贫困的猴子得到了一份男仆的工作，在可以接触到富豪级别猿猴的游艇俱乐部里勤勤恳恳地工作，它母亲为此感动得流泪）。故事发表出来，迅速得到传播，Jenkins在Twitter上发了个表格，希望可以为每只猿猴创作故事，于是收到了非常多无聊猿持有者的私信与故事投稿。接下来Jenkins又迅速写下了十几个故事，当时Jenkins在现实世界里还有着产品经理的正职工作，一下班就马不停蹄开始写故事，这个过程中，他就有了把讲故事的过程规模化的愿望。这也就是[Tally Labs创业故事的源头](https://www.defidaonews.com/article/6751710)，Tally Labs于2022年5月获得了A16Z领投的1200万美元融资。（这个故事的更多细节，可以参考播客[《无聊猿创意故事 社群：Jenkins的“作者之家”》](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/6268b5d0bf39836fd02b7770)）\n\n![无聊猿#1798](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V-CO-wMEOCX0JyZIUL_XQ.png?height=448&width=596)\n\n过了3个月Jenkins推出了写作者之家Writer’s Room（Writer's Room创始团队有3人，是Tally Labs的前身），并发行了6942个[作者之家通行证NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/jenkins-the-valet)（4档，WAGMI Yacht、Yacht Key、Jenkin's Key、Valet Ticket），通行证NFT持有者将可以为故事内容提供创意，对故事发展方向进行投票，并在所制作的每件作品中被标记为作者/创作者，NFT发行后6分钟内销售一空。\n\n由一个故事共创的愿望种子开始，我们看到了写作者之家的兴起，再到后来Jenkins 成为第一个与经纪公司 CAA（Creative Artists Agency） 签约的 NFT 人物，与畅销书作者 Neil Strauss 、与 Murda Beatz 以及 MBSJQ 等更多「名流」进行了合作。这个创业故事本身也足够精彩！\n\n根据写作者之家的Roadmap，以后他们故事创作的对象或不限于无聊猿，还会扩展到其他的头像类项目，故事将可能为这些PFP带来生动的灵魂。\n\n### 图片/漫画\n\n[The Space乌图邦](https://thespace.game/)是一个应用激进市场理论的 NFT

Space](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tA_MIzkU6biO2rsHgD6X0.png?height=1872&width=3622)\n\n## Web3内容共创光谱\n\n之前和躺赢君对话的播客里，我们尝试沿着一个光谱从过去Web2/传统领域的内容共创一路摸索。光谱的一端是团队（或者作品发起的个人），另一端是社区，每个共创型项目，其实都有一定比例是由团队/发起人主导的，然后留有一些空间给到社区成员去参与、发挥创意、贡献内容。\n\n![图片来源：Vibe Squad&Web3随意门](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jjIvWBhS4Q-lUu2vlTTFs.png?height=668&width=1176)\n\n为什么要提出这种可能看起来很刻板的框架？对实践有啥意义吗？我认为这是一个认知工具，因为在跟对这个领域比较陌生的小伙伴聊的时候，大多第一反应是，共创？不专业、没想法的一群乌合之众能创造出什么？还是专业的人干专业的事吧。\n\n其实大家对共创的认识是一上来就拉到光谱最右端，或者视“完全去中心化的自下而上的社区创作”为理想化的状态。现实是，绝大部分共创类项目的尝试都是从自上而下开始，而且都需要一个强大的初创团队，类似于DAO的渐进式去中心化，需要一个过程去测试应该置于光谱的什么位置，既能保证项目的可持续进行，[创作出无限游戏式的故事](https://blog.simondlr.com/posts/infinite-game-storytelling)，也能给到社区自由发挥的空间、调动共创的积极性。\n\n## 一些乐观的视角\n\nWeb3内容共创让我们摸到了创作者经济4.0的边，它之于整个Web3领域有什么意义？Web3领域经常为人诟病的一点是，都是投机炒作，都在做一些不切实际的玩具，现状是普通人onboard Web3的第一站就是投机炒币撸空投，不说高大上的意义，内容共创至少给了一个容器接纳新进场的人，以后，也许很多创意工作者来到Web3的第一站就是buidl，就是创作。那进一步质疑，创作出来的还是玩具呢？这时候SolarPunk主义者可能就会跳出来说，积极乐观就对了，要相信我们能创造出一个高科技高品质生活的未来。我不太清楚王超老师是否信奉SolarPunk那一套，但他的一条[推文](https://twitter.com/cwweb3/status/1550139629969424384)很有道理，也反映了积极乐观的意思：\n\n![图片来源：推特](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E-5SHy-eHku5SeoStHF-Q.png?height=975&width=959)\n\n我认为，乐观并不是盲目的、毫无缘由的，对Web3、DAO、创作者经济持积极态度的人，都是一定程度上认可[《主权个人The Sovereign Individual》](https://book.douban.com/subject/1919172/)思想的，他们认为，勇于承担个人责任是通往自由和财富的道路，他们通过主动寻求和筛选信息，跳出标准化的生活圈子，打造自己的游戏规则并建立杠杆，来实现财福双全的生活。预计极具创造力的[10亿数字游民/主权个体的涌入](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/p1CUFmLX0vdbIVR5FefLrA)，资本的青睐——A16Z第四只基金宣布其支持方向，其中之一就是去中心化创作，都让我们窥见创作者经济广阔的发展空间与可期的未来。\n\n关于相信认可DAO、认可个体创作潜能、主权个人的力量这一点，我想起有小伙伴说“我不像你对DAO有信仰，我只想赚钱”。与其说对DAO有信仰，还不如说，我只是想尽自己所能推自己一把，去体验新领域的危险、幽深、锐利、汹涌与莽撞，我想对自己有信仰，相信自己可以。\n\n如果不相信主权个人的力量，则更多是用投机市场的姿态来看事情，这是中性的意思，投机者也完全有可能收获颇丰，从生态多样性的角度来看，投机者也发挥着极其重要的作用。“我看你说的一些项目、一些所谓的build的交互，以为会有空投，原来做链上好人只是韭菜表现”。好吧，我是韭菜，我所指的链上做好事，其实指的是建立链上资产，NFT容器里所承载的数字资产。我朴素而稚嫩的想法是，如今DeFi先发展起来，其实是链上世界金融先行，“实体”跟上就需要大量的创作者创作出作品，到时候DeFi将不再被诟病为“空转着一堆空气币”，而是“实实在在”的、能丰富个人精神生活的数字资产。\n\n## 批判性思考\n\n乐观之余，我们可能还是要作一些批判性思考。\n\n**局限性**\n\n再回过头看文中提到的案例，这些项目的发起方，都有着很优秀的背景：Shibuya的联创，pplpleasr是Web3领域名声大噪的艺术家，为众多头部DeFi协议创作宣传片、为《财富》杂志创作NFT封面，另一位艺术家maciej_kuciara，好莱坞动画制作人；ReHash的Diana Chen，在Web3播客领域有着丰富经验。\n\n我们不禁会想到，能撬动社区力量来参与创作的创作者/发起人，似乎都有点“头部创作者”属性或者本身就是号召力很强的influencer，也就是说，他们本身不组建社区、不发行NFT、不去设计社区参与玩法，也可以以创作者经济3.0的模式实现直接的内容变现。播客Web3无名说[《Web3的核心是共创精神》](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/6270b2163e8abf901a68d959?s=eyJ1IjoiNjBmNTk1ZjFlMGY1ZTcyM2JiODgxYzY3In0%3D)中的嘉宾就指出，基于区块链的Web3创作者经济，直接内容付费可能只有1%的创作者能做到，那其他99%的创作者如何受益？这是关于“注意力”这种公共资源的分配问题，解决问题的思路指向哈勃格税、激进市场。Web3共创的玩法，在适用范围与对象方面有它的局限性，对于非头部创作者、影响者的小众领域创作者，可能需要探索一些新的思路。\n\n**协调难度大于创作本身**\n\n共创意味着创作者在专心创作之余，还要花费大量精力去设计共创的机制与流程，包括很重要的版权许可问题。一些DAO tool对于协调组织内的协作将发挥很重要的作用，我们也看到[越来越多工具的出现](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRfIhcckhdNi9xSaCpCIDc2VV5HkprLlnp7lbTh5Txk/edit#gid=464771811)，以期解决协作难题。实际推进一些创新的机制总是不易，我们需要给到这些实验性项目更多的耐心。\n\n未来，关于创作者经济的探索，还有大量工作需要做，恰逢LiJin免费开放了在线课程，一起来补课、思考与建设吧：https://creatoreconomycourse.xyz/\n\n最后，感谢王超、Joel、Henry、躺赢君以及Web3随意门听众朋友的素材提供、灵感启发与支持。",

{"id": "w7Khqn4w3--dBJJh8Do1im59svF4fuBuOkPQJy3T0i4", "title": "Historical Journey Through Artificial Intelligence", "body": "Origins of actual modern research on artificial intelligence (AI) stems from Alan M. Turing - in his seminal paper published in 1950 titled “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”. At the time, the idea of AI was still far-fetched from what humans understood today in terms of its advancement and sophistry. It wasn't until 1955 when McCarthy, Minsky, Rochester and Shannon (1956) coined the term “artificial intelligence” during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project proposal and officially established the AI discipline as a standalone field. This paper will explore the historical evolution of AI research since the 1950s. By analyzing key research documents and their philosophical approach, the author wishes to compare and contrast AI development and identify its areas of improvement.\n\nThe analysis begins with Turing’s paper, where he proposed the question: “Can machines think?” (Turing, 1950, p. 433). Turing uses an interpretivism paradigm to this brand new understanding of what AI is to the world, which he called machine intelligence - conditional on the complexities (Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill, 2016, p. 718) he defines of what makes a machine, a machine. With the Turing test, a party game of sorts, a human evaluator will judge the response of a human and a machine participant to a series of questions. Using response data collected through typewritten responses, the evaluator shall determine which of a participant is man, and which is machine. Depending on the evaluator’s decision, it helps one to identify the ability of machines to exhibit man-like intelligence and behavior. Thus, a relativism ontological approach is adopted by Turing to identify machine intelligence. Turing emphasized the new idea via interpretivism by complicating the definition of machine intelligence. Conventional machines, called discrete state machines, offer a finite output when used - a simple example would be a switch which switches lights on and off. His idea was a digital computer with a *universality* property where a machine acts as a continuous system - varying across time and adapting to changes to offer different output based on conditions (Turing, 1950).\n\nConstraints have been identified, too, of what limits the possibility of a continuous system machine intelligence. Simply put, the Turing test compares the mimicking behavior of machines to humans, and does not directly measure its intelligence. The missing element lies in the ‘soul’ and ‘emotions’ of a machine, relative to a human (Jefferson, 1949) - and hence, it lacks the originality of intelligent behavior a human is capable of (Abramson, 2008). Turing’s use of interpretivism displayed his personal values and opinion on what he assumed to be the subjective reality of AI research should be. Hence, the qualitative approach was useful in arguing his stance on what he believed to be the correct representation of AI.\n\nMoving on, the author analyzes the critique Nilsson (1983) provides on the progress of AI and its potential for the 21st-century. Using critical theory philosophy, Nilsson highlights his personal opinion on the niche of AI as a discipline and the challenges AI has to overcome to propagate. He categorized the niche into 7 distinctive components that defines AI: (1) a propositional doctrine where programming the foundation of an AI program has to be logic-based and in formalism to facts; (2) the importance of incorporating partial models via performative knowledge to understand the greater system in question; (3) incorporating expert knowledge across different discipline to identify effective ideas via propositional doctrine (ie. use of maths discipline in scientific or physics research); (4) producing efficient results by controlling the scope of how data is incorporated; (5) controlling the learning and searching procedures of the program to birth controlled results; (6) ability to understand and process natural language (ie. English); and (7) incorporate cognitive ability into programs for flexible reasoning.\n\nIn terms of challenges, three are particularly important as mentioned by Nilsson. The *dead duck challenge* dictates that there is no single true approach to AI research as truths are infinite and variable. Much like the normative statement which states all birds can fly, it is far from the truth as dead ducks don't - hence the *dead duck challenge*. Nilsson conveyed that AI research has a myriad of approaches and one should not be confined to singularities. The second *holistic challenge* is where research problems are broken down into 3 parts: what is knowledge, how to represent said knowledge, and how said knowledge can be used. Knowledge in question should not be subdivided and looked at individually, as there exists a strong linkage of knowledge usage depending on how knowledge is represented, which is dependent on what defines said knowledge. The third *kludge challenge* talks about simplification in research. Nilsson mentioned that a kludge - an improvisation and simplified assumption of what a truth may be - of a theory should be encouraged as it better conveys the teachings of a discipline. This is contrary to some beliefs that research, and AI research, should not be simplified to such empirical forms as it may lose valuable information as it is haphazardly reduced to a kludge (Nilsson, 1983).\n\nNilsson’s challenges are not baseless worries as they highlight the gaps and practical knowledge researchers should focus on. His historical revisitation, one now better understands the niche of AI as a discipline. Using critical theory, Nilsson explained the social construct of what constitutes AI  as a discipline and  the suppressive challenges it faces across academia regarding  its development.\n\nFast forward today, the leading AI subfield is machine learning (ML). ML is a computational algorithm that learns and improves itself automatically through the input data and outputs predictive outcomes based on its designs (Koza et al., 1996). Through this learning process, it adapts and enhances its usability to cater for different situations. This is vastly similar to the *learning machines* proposed by Turing (1950) in the final section of his seminal paper - a machine that acts as a continuous system capable of producing results based on input data and its operating environment. Today’s ML models are a perfect example of what Turing envisioned 70 years prior.\n\nNichols et al. (2018) discusses the simplest scientific application of various ML models to medical imaging and diagnostics - a typical positivism philosophy is adopted. The advancement of data collection and computational capabilities enabled traditional statistical modelling to evolve into ML models. The amalgamation of big data, computational power, and exponential growth in algorithm design allowed for models such as linear regression, supervised learning methods, and deep learning to be applied to the scientific research field. In particular, researchers are able to drawout vast array of information by manipulating the interaction between these big data observations and produce outcomes intangible to human observation. Essentially, the application of ML models saves both time and money as it is capable of classification, segmentation, and detection in the medical field.  Gone are the days of intensive manual labour in the field of medical research along with frequent human errors. The automation that comes with ML modelling brings about significant benefits and efficiency.\n\nHowever, Nichols et al. (2018) stated that ML isn’t without pitfalls. As the lifeline of ML, the algorithm programmed is heavily dependent on the observational data collected. Depending on the quality of input data and its authenticity, ML models may produce bogus results if researchers are not careful with the theoretical assumptions of said models. Furthermore, it is not without worry that this automated convenience may strip researchers off their ability computation skills. Thus, the use of a simple positivism  approach was effective in explaining the quantitative applications of ML models in modern scientific research.\n\nThe last philosophical review will be based on the comprehensive AI index report of 2021 by Stanford University’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institute (HAI), conducted by Zhang et al. (2021). The team took a modernized approach of pragmatism in which they examined the AI industry in general. Data were sourced from across the globe from both the field of academia, private entities, governments, and non-profits for an unbiased worldwide view of the current AI market across a multitude of perspectives.\n\nThe HAI team (2021) aimed to contribute to the knowledge of the AI market by evaluating its presence in 7 major aspects: research & development, technical performance, economy, AI education, ethical challenges, diversification, and policy & strategies of AI. With a combination of data-driven approach and theory-driven reasoning and ethics, key changes in the 2021 economy due to the pandemic have led to brand new discoveries. Notably, the biggest AI investment went to drug design and discovery, a 450% increase since 2019. In terms of education and academia output, sharp increase in AI-field PhD graduates are observed, coupled with many postgraduate researchers migrating to the US’ AI-industry. Though, an alarming issue is the ethical benchmarks concerning AI. This blurring connection between AI technology and societal application for average citizens makes it difficult for one to establish a clear ethical benchmark on data access and privacy.\n\nOverall, the pragmatism approach adopted by Zhang et al. allowed for AI to be examined more closely with clearcut questions that require answers and considers issues from both objective and subjective orientation - publishing this yearly comprehensive report.", "timestamp": 1658587144, "digest": "cnV6q4vP0F64lnImerk5lN08VCI8wmmFw-LsdDHjmCI", "contributor": "0x6E5cc01c94fFaB8A1db9e70A8caC19767f239443"}

{"id": "S6hIsrbjvdIS8_Feg6XncF0KYUiUSNh3KfVwhE24d-c", "title": "Testing Smart Contracts using Hardhat (JavaScript)", "body": "Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment from Nomic Foundation that can be used for compiling, testing and deploying our Solidity smart contracts. When implementing tests, Hardhat makes use of JavaScript (or TypeScript) scripts as testing instructions. This makes Hardhat one of the most commonly used tools for testing and deploying smart contracts, as many developers already know JavaScript or could easily learn it.\n\nTesting is a fundamental step in smart contract development. Due to the cost of deployment, and the potential funds at stake, it is important that we check our contract behaves as expected beforehand. Hardhat comes with the Hardhat Network built in. This is a local Ethereum network node that Hardhat uses to deploy to and run tests. The upshot of this is that Hardhat can be used to freely and quickly test your smart contract.\n\n## Getting set up\n\nThe rest of this guide is going to assume you have Node.js installed (and therefore npm) and are using a Unix based operating systerm (Mac OS or Linux).\n\nFirst we create a new folder for our environment and navigate to it in our terminal. Once there run the following to initialise a Node.js project:\n\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nNow run the following to install Hardhat:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev hardhat\n```\n\nThen select ‘Create an empty hardhat.config.js’. You now have a Hardhat development environment set up in this folder and a config file.\n\nIn this directory create 2 new folders, ‘contracts’ and ‘test’, so that your environment has the following structure:\n\n```\ncontracts/\ntest/\nhardhat.config.js\n```\n\nCongratulations, you now have a Hardhat development environment.\n\n## Creating our smart contract\n\nNow we need a smart contract that we can use for testing. For the purpose of this guide I have chosen to use If / Else from the great website Solidity by Example.\n\n[https://solidity-by-example.org/if-else/](https://solidity-by-example.org/if-else/)\n\nCopy the following code and save it to a new file named IfElse.sol inside of our contracts folder.\n\n```\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.9;\n\ncontract IfElse {\n    function foo(uint x) public pure returns (uint) {\n        if (x < 10) {\n            return 0;\n        } else if (x < 20) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return 2;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function ternary(uint _x) public pure returns (uint) {\n        // if (_x < 10) {\n        //     return 1;\n        // }\n        // return 2;\n\n        // shorthand way to write if / else statement\n        // the \"?\" operator is called the ternary operator\n        return _x < 10 ? 1 : 2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above smart contract has been made to demonstrate the following:\n\n* how if, else if and else statements are written in Solidity (the foo() function)\n* how the ternary operator can be used as shorthand for an if / else statement (the ternary() function)\n\nfoo(), the first function in our contract takes a positive integer as an argument and returns 0 if that number is less than 10, 1 if it is greater than or equal to 10 but less than 20 and 2 if it is greater than or equal to 20.\n\nternary(), the second function in our contract takes a positive integer as an argument and returns 1 if that number is less than 10, 2 if it is greater than or equal to 10.\n\nFinally we need to compile our contract, to do this run the following code in your terminal:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nNext we create a script that deploys our contract to the Hardhat network and tests each function passing them arguments specified before hand.\n\n## Writing our tests\n\nTo write our tests we first need to create a new JavaScript file. In the test folder we create the file IfElse.js and begin with the following code:\n\n```\nconst { expect } = require(\"chai\");\n\ndescribe(\"IfElse contract\", function () {\n\n  it(\"foo should return 0 for any positive integer less than 10\", async function() {\n    const IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n    \n    const hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n    \n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(4)).to.equal(0);\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\nThe first line imports the expect function from the chai assertion library (this is a library commonly used when testing JavaScript code). Next we use describe() to begin a sequence of tests, and inside of this, we call each test using it(). “If Else contract” is what is printed to the console when this sequence of tests begin, and “foo should return 0 for any positive integer less than 10” is what is printed to the console when the specific test is implemented. Now we understand the structure of a test script lets look at what this specific test, “foo should return 0 for any positive integer less than 10”, is doing.\n\n“foo should return 0 for any positive integer less than 10” is testing the foo function and making sure that when we pass it a positive integer less than 10 it returns 0 as expected. Let’s now look at what each line of this test is doing.\n\n```\nconst IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n```\n\nThe above line of code is using ethers.js to interact with the Hardhat network, getContractFactory is an abstraction used to deploy smart contracts. Therefore IfElse is a constant that has been assigned a factory for instances of our contract. It isn’t necessary to understand this step in detail at this stage.\n\n```javascript\nconst hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n```\n\nThe second line of code in our test takes an instance of our contract and deploys it to the Hardhat network, assigning our deployed contract to the constant hardhatIfElse.\n\n```javascript\nexpect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(4)).to.equal(0);\n```\n\nThe final line of code inside of our test begins a Chai assertion with expect. An assertion is an expression which evaluates to the boolean value true if the code inside of it behaves as expected. Inside of expect our expression is calling the foo function from our smart contract, passing 4 into it as an argument and expecting that to equal to 0. Our test will fail if this is not the case.\n\nNow we have a test script written we can run our tests. Inside of your project folder run the following in the terminal:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat test\n```\n\nYour output should look something like this:\n\n![The result of running one successful test in Hardhat.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JunXZHjRtAZPRrAsDsMmZ.png?height=172&width=997)\n\nBefore writing more tests lets discuss what the above output means. ‘IfElse contract’ is the name we gave to our sequence of tests in our script, ‘foo should return 0 for any positive integer less than 10’ is the name we gave to our particular test. We are also made aware that this particular test passed by the green tick and that this test took 579ms to run. Finally we are told that of all of our tests, 1 passed in total, and that all of our tests took 580ms to run in total. Try changing foo(4) to foo(11) in your test script and running the test again to see what happens.\n\nSo far we have only tested how foo() responds when passed an argument less than 10. We shall now run some more tests on foo() to see how it responds to arguments with different expected outcomes. Replace your test script with the code below:\n\n```javascript\nconst { expect } = require(\"chai\");\n\ndescribe(\"IfElse contract\", function () {\n\n  it(\"foo should return 0 for any positive integer less than 10\", async function() {\n    const IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n    \n    const hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n    \n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(4)).to.equal(0);\n  });\n\n  it(\"foo should return 1 for any positive integer greater than or equal to 10 and less than 20\", async function() {\n    const IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n    \n    const hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(10)).to.equal(1);\n  });\n\n  it(\"foo should return 2 for any positive integer greater than or equal to 20\", async function() {\n    const IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n    \n    const hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n    \n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(20)).to.equal(2);\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\nThe above script now has 3 separate tests inside our sequence of tests. 2 of these are new, but very similar to our original test. The first new test is passing 10 as an argument and expecting 1 to be returned, and the second new test is passing 20 as an argument as expecting 2 to be returned. Now we have 1 test for each of the expected outputs from our foo() function. Lets now run these tests in Hardhat using:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat test\n```\n\nYour output should look something like this:\n\n![The result of running 3 successful tests in Hardhat.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1DdLx_yAWj0cwCPBZ866d.png?height=226&width=1416)\n\nWe can see above that we have now ran 3 successful tests on the foo() function from our smart contract.\n\nBefore we add any more tests we are going to refactor our test script as the same tests can be achieved using fewer lines of code.\n\n## Using fixtures for repeated contract deployment\n\nNotice that in all 3 of our tests we run the following 2 lines of code before our assertion:\n\n```\nconst IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n    \nconst hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n```\n\nThis is because we need to redeploy our smart contract to the Hardhat network before each test. This is not only wasteful in terms of how many lines of code we need to write, it is also computationally expensive. A solution to this is using fixtures. A fixture is a function that is only ran the first time it is invoked. On all subsequent invocations our fixture won’t be invoked, but the state of our Hardhat network will be reset. What this means is we can deploy our contract for our first test (using the instructions we define in our fixture) and then for all other tests reset the state of the network, making it so any changes to the network made by previous tests are reverted. This is because when we invoke our fixture we will be using a function imported from hardhat-network-helpers called loadFixture.\n\nFirst we need to add the following to hardhat.config.js so we can use hardhat-network-helpers:\n\n```\nrequire(\"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\");\n```\n\nThen to import the loadFixture function add the following to the top of your test script:\n\n```javascript\nconst { loadFixture } = require(\"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\");\n```\n\nNow we need to define our fixture function and add it to the beginning of our sequence of tests:\n\n```javascript\nasync function deployIfElseFixture() {\n    const IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n    const hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n\n    return hardhatIfElse;\n  }\n```\n\nAt the moment this is just a regular JavaScript function that deploys our smart contract (using the same code we have previously used to do this) and returns our deployed contract. To make this work as intended we need to only call this function inside of Hardhat’s loadFixture function. Therefore we remove the contract deployment from each test and replace it with this line of code:\n\n```javascript\nconst hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n```\n\nThis means that the first time loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture) is invoked it deploys the contract but on all subsequent invocations it just resets the state of the Hardhat network instead.\n\nOnce we have defined our fixture, and replaced all smart contract deployments with the above line of code our script should look like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst { expect } = require(\"chai\");\nconst { loadFixture } = require(\"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\");\n\ndescribe(\"IfElse contract\", function () {\n  async function deployIfElseFixture() {\n    const IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n    const hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n\n    return hardhatIfElse;\n  }\n\n  it(\"foo should return 0 for any positive integer less than 10\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 4\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(4)).to.equal(0);\n  });\n\n  it(\"foo should return 1 for any positive integer greater than or equal to 10 and less than 20\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 10\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(10)).to.equal(1);\n  });\n\n  it(\"foo should return 2 for any positive integer greater than or equal to 20\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 20\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(20)).to.equal(2);\n  });\n  \n});\n```\n\nSave your new script and check it runs using:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat test\n```\n\n## Adding more tests\n\nYou may have noticed that so far we have only tested the foo function form our smart contract, we still need to test the ternary function. Now we are using a fixture we can add more tests even faster than before. We shall add another test now, this time to check that ternary returns 1 when passed an argument less than 10:\n\n```\nit(\"ternary should return 1 for any positive integer less than 10\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 5\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.ternary(5)).to.equal(1);\n  });\n```\n\nThis code is added to our sequence of tests, the same as previous tests. This test is similar to those implemented earlier, except now we call on the ternary function using hardhatIfElse.ternary. To test both possible return values for ternary we shall also add the following test:\n\n```javascript\nit(\"ternary should return 2 for any positive integer greater than or equal to 10\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 15\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.ternary(15)).to.equal(2);\n  });\n```\n\nThis is tests that ternary returns 2 when passed an argument greater than or equal to 10.\n\nNow we have done that we should have the final version of our testing script which should look like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst { expect } = require(\"chai\");\nconst { loadFixture } = require(\"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\");\n\ndescribe(\"IfElse contract\", function () {\n  async function deployIfElseFixture() {\n    const IfElse = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"IfElse\");\n    const hardhatIfElse = await IfElse.deploy();\n\n    return hardhatIfElse;\n  }\n\n  it(\"foo should return 0 for any positive integer less than 10\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 4\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(4)).to.equal(0);\n  });\n\n  it(\"foo should return 1 for any positive integer greater than or equal to 10 and less than 20\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 10\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(10)).to.equal(1);\n  });\n\n  it(\"foo should return 2 for any positive integer greater than or equal to 20\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 20\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.foo(20)).to.equal(2);\n  });\n\n  it(\"ternary should return 1 for any positive integer less than 10\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 5\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.ternary(5)).to.equal(1);\n  });\n\n  it(\"ternary should return 2 for any positive integer greater than or equal to 10\", async function() {\n    const hardhatIfElse = await loadFixture(deployIfElseFixture);\n    // Input the number 15\n    expect(await hardhatIfElse.ternary(15)).to.equal(2);\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\nand when we run\n\n```\nnpx hardhat test\n```\n\nwe should get the following output:\n\n![Successfully running 5 tests using Hardhat.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1EVjvyQS64nxdgi0KF7A3.png?height=200&width=1344)\n\nThe above shows we have successfully ran all 5 tests and that our contract has behaved as we expected in all 5 cases.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive set of tests but should give you a good starting point for testing your smart contracts in the future.", "timestamp": 1658587989, "digest": "WNXloh9KaEwpeQpl6GTNJSu6n-eTN2haZssnb2uQU-0", "contributor": "0x3d67b76CF3dcc881255eb2262E788BE03b2f5B9F"}

岁末活动常问FAQ\n\n 1. 中文任务教程哪里找 ?\n    以下三篇都可以参考，请先尝试从里面找答案。\n

2. 活动截止日期 ? 活动规则 ?\n    1 / 2 早上 11 : 59 截止。只要任选完成 10 个任务，并在1 / 6 00 : 00 快照前在官网领取至少铸造10张 NFT ( 注意 NFT 各自的领取时限 )，就可以在 1 / 7 领取特别版 Galaxy NFT。\n 3. 做完任务了还不能领 NFT ?\n    快照有分为立即 ( 完成后马上可以领取 NFT )，每日 ( 完成后请有耐心等待隔日快照 )，规定时间 ( 完成后须等待至快照后再撤出流动性 )，可以至官网上方 GALAXY ID 查看是否已完成任务 ( 会显示条目 )。\n    <https://galaxy.eco/galaxyid/>\n 4.

{"id": "_0834hU88XLRfrZpknvOG4_c9wrADU0tDsmwH068K4E", "title": "Not just Bitcoin price: Factors affecting BTC miner profitability", "body": "The ongoing cryptocurrency bear market has triggered a massive decline in Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) mining profitability as BTC mining expenses outpace the price of Bitcoin.\n\nClosely tied to the drop in the BTC price, Bitcoin mining profitability has been tanking since late 2021 and [reached its lowest multi-month levels](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-mining-costs-reach-10-month-lows-as-miners-use-more-efficient-rigs) in early July 2022.\n\nAccording to data from crypto tracking website Bitinfocharts, BTC mining profitability [tumbled](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#3y) to as low as $0.07 per day per 1 terahash per second (THash/s) on July 1, 2022, touching the lowest level since October 2020.\n\nThe decline in BTC mining profitability has caused some big changes in the crypto mining industry.\n\nLower Bitcoin prices fueled selling pressure as miners were pushed to sell their BTC to continue mining and pay for electricity. The majority of big crypto mining firms like Core Scientific had to [sell a significant amount of Bitcoin](https://cointelegraph.com/news/core-scientific-sold-167m-worth-of-bitcoin-holdings-in-june) in order to survive the tough market conditions.\n\nThe growing unprofitability of BTC mining has also triggered a big drop in demand for crypto mining devices, causing many miners to [sell their mining hardware at a discount](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-prices-will-continue-to-fall-f2pool-exec-predicts).\n\nAs lower prices of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners and graphics processing units (GPU) may drive more interest from new miners, it’s crucial to remember that the price of mining hardware is just one out of many factors behind BTC mining profitability.\n\n## What is Bitcoin mining profitability and how is it defined?\n\nBitcoin mining is an economic activity that involves the production of the digital currency Bitcoin using the computing power of GPU-based miners or specifically-designed ASIC miners.\n\nBitcoin mining profitability is a measure defining the degree to which a Bitcoin miner yields profit based on a wide number of factors, including the price of Bitcoin, the mining difficulty, the cost of energy, the type of mining hardware and others.\n\n**Factor 1: Bitcoin price and block rewards**\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is one of the most evident factors impacting the BTC mining profitability as the value of BTC is directly proportional to profits yielded by miners.\n\nBear markets trigger even [more attention to BTC price from miners](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-miners-finally-capitulating-5-things-to-know-in-bitcoin-this-week) because they risk losing money if BTC drops below a certain price level.\n\nMiners should also take into account the amount of the block reward or the amount of BTC given to miners for mining one block on the BTC blockchain. Bitcoin’s original block reward amounted to as much as 50 BTC before it was [cut to the current 6.5 BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-happened-bitcoin-just-experienced-third-halving-in-its-history) following three historical block reward halvings.\n\nBitcoin halvings are a major part of the BTC protocol, aiming to decrease the quantity of the new coins entering the network by [cutting the block reward in half](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter) every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years.\n\n**Factor 2: Bitcoin mining hardware characteristics**\n\nBitcoin mining profitability largely depends on the choice of a BTC mining device and related characteristics including hash rate, power consumption and price.\n\nHash rate is the processing power of a miner, measured in hashes per second (H/S). Higher hash rates include representations in kilohashes per second (KH/S), gigahashes per second (GH/S), terahashes per second (TH/S), exahashes per second (EH/S) and so on.\n\nA miner’s hash rate is the speed at which it can solve crypto mining puzzles to mine Bitcoin. The faster the speed, the more BTC is mined in a specific timeframe. As the [BTC hash rate is constantly breaking new highs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hash-rate-marks-all-time-high-as-btc-price-drops-below-25k), Bitcoin miner manufacturers regularly produce new mining devices supporting higher hash rates, while older miners apparently become obsolete over time.\n\nAnother important feature of a BTC mining device is the energy consumption. With rising global energy costs, a miner’s ability to consume less energy is essential.\n\nThe price of actual mining devices is also an important expense when calculating the BTC mining profitability. Both GPU and ASIC miners got cheaper amid the bear market this year, but brand new flagship miners still cost more than $11,000 at the time of writing.\n\n**Factor 3: Mining difficulty and hash rate**\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to mine a BTC block, with a higher difficulty requiring additional computing power to verify transactions and mine new coins.\n\nNetwork difficulty has been rising in 2022, [continually breaking new all-time highs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-network-difficulty-breaks-into-a-new-all-time-high-of-29-794t). Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, or about every two weeks, as Bitcoin is programmed to self-adjust in order to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes.\n\nThe Bitcoin hash rate is another fundamental metric for assessing the strength of the BTC network, as a higher hashrate means more computing power is required to verify and add transactions to the blockchain. This also makes BTC more secure because it would take more miners as well as more energy and time to take over the network.\n\n**Factor 4: Electricity costs**\n\nThe price of electricity is another important factor when calculating the profitability of BTC mining.\n\nMiners consider electricity prices in various countries in compliance with local crypto mining regulations. As mining activity puts [extra stress on a power grid](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-miners-in-texas-shut-down-operations-as-state-experiences-extreme-heat-wave), it’s important to double-check local requirements and specific energy prices for powering BTC miners in this or that country or region.\n\nBitcoin mining can be powered by many energy sources, both renewable like wind and solar and nonrenewable sources including fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Amid soaring energy prices caused by recent supply issues, miners should pay special attention to possible implications on BTC mining income when using nonrenewable energy.\n\n**Factor 5: Pool fee if not mining solo**\n\nMany Bitcoin miners prefer to join mining pools instead of working as individual miners. That is a way to combine their computing power and increase the chances of finding a block and mining BTC faster.\n\nPool miners should be aware of another small expense that is taken by pool admins that set up the software for this type of mining. The fee is generally 1-3% of the miner’s individual reward, depending on the pool.\n\n**Factor 6: Other expenses**\n\nBitcoin mining expenses are not exclusive to ASICs and GPUs and network indicators. BTC mining may also require some additional investment related to the physical mining setup, including facilities and property that are a good fit. Significant expenses may include cooling or noise canceling equipment as some miner machines are associated with a [massive amount of heat and noise pollution](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-lawmakers-sound-alarm-to-epa-over-environment-concerns-of-crypto-mining).\n\n## Crypto mining calculators\n\nOne of the easiest ways to calculate Bitcoin mining profitability based on all the listed factors is using online BTC mining calculators.\n\nDesigned to simplify the process of calculating Bitcoin mining profitability, a BTC mining calculator predicts the approximate mining income based on inputs like BTC price, hash rate, electricity price and others.\n\nLet’s take an example of calculating Bitcoin mining profitability with a brand new Bitmain ASIC Antminer S19 Pro using the BTC mining calculator by crypto market data provider CryptoCompare.\n\nAntminer S19 Pro has a maximum hashrate of 110TH/s and power consumption of 3250W. Let’s assume that a miner’s pool fee is 2% and the miner is based in North Dakota, where the average residential electricity rate in 2022 [amounts](https://findenergy.com/nd/#:\\~:text=North%20Dakota's%20Electricity%20Prices%20and,based%20on%20average%20electricity%20rate.) to roughly $0.11, versus the United States national average price of roughly $0.14.\n\n***Related: [BTC mining costs reach 10-month lows as miners use more efficient rigs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-mining-costs-reach-10-month-lows-as-miners-use-more-efficient-rigs)***\n\nGiven these variables, the daily profit ratio accounts for 27%, with possible BTC mining profits [amounting](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=110&HashingUnit=TH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=3250&CostPerkWh=0.11&MiningPoolFee=2) to $70 per month, or $840 per year, according to CryptoCompare. In contrast, given the U.S. national average electricity price of $0.14, the daily profit ratio [amounts](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=110&HashingUnit=TH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=3250&CostPerkWh=0.14&MiningPoolFee=2) to 0% or even generates a loss with the current BTC price and other network indicators.", "timestamp": 1658588830, "digest": "ECTtW38dbcwDzo-WQppeqA72SehYcmafgQgp4sKgjUY", "contributor": "0x52CEb287BEb81D61eDf413A8B3007b611E8917EA"}

{"id": "ZN5FkQrv1Ei_pCYFPpA1WQ2dR3rINqvv2lAfl-KrBNw", "title": "Not just Bitcoin price: Factors affecting BTC miner profitability", "body": "The ongoing cryptocurrency bear market has triggered a massive decline in Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) mining profitability as BTC mining expenses outpace the price of Bitcoin.\n\nClosely tied to the drop in the BTC price, Bitcoin mining profitability has been tanking since late 2021 and [reached its lowest multi-month levels](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-mining-costs-reach-10-month-lows-as-miners-use-more-efficient-rigs) in early July 2022.\n\nAccording to data from crypto tracking website Bitinfocharts, BTC mining profitability [tumbled](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#3y) to as low as $0.07 per day per 1 terahash per second (THash/s) on July 1, 2022, touching the lowest level since October 2020.\n\nThe decline in BTC mining profitability has caused some big changes in the crypto mining industry.\n\nLower Bitcoin prices fueled selling pressure as miners were pushed to sell their BTC to continue mining and pay for electricity. The majority of big crypto mining firms like Core Scientific had to [sell a significant amount of Bitcoin](https://cointelegraph.com/news/core-scientific-sold-167m-worth-of-bitcoin-holdings-in-june) in order to survive the tough market conditions.\n\nThe growing unprofitability of BTC mining has also triggered a big drop in demand for crypto mining devices, causing many miners to [sell their mining hardware at a discount](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-prices-will-continue-to-fall-f2pool-exec-predicts).\n\nAs lower prices of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners and graphics processing units (GPU) may drive more interest from new miners, it’s crucial to remember that the price of mining hardware is just one out of many factors behind BTC mining profitability.\n\n## What is Bitcoin mining profitability and how is it defined?\n\nBitcoin mining is an economic activity that involves the production of the digital currency Bitcoin using the computing power of GPU-based miners or specifically-designed ASIC miners.\n\nBitcoin mining profitability is a measure defining the degree to which a Bitcoin miner yields profit based on a wide number of factors, including the price of Bitcoin, the mining difficulty, the cost of energy, the type of mining hardware and others.\n\n**Factor 1: Bitcoin price and block rewards**\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is one of the most evident factors impacting the BTC mining profitability as the value of BTC is directly proportional to profits yielded by miners.\n\nBear markets trigger even [more attention to BTC price from miners](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-miners-finally-capitulating-5-things-to-know-in-bitcoin-this-week) because they risk losing money if BTC drops below a certain price level.\n\nMiners should also take into account the amount of the block reward or the amount of BTC given to miners for mining one block on the BTC blockchain. Bitcoin’s original block reward amounted to as much as 50 BTC before it was [cut to the current 6.5 BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-happened-bitcoin-just-experienced-third-halving-in-its-history) following three historical block reward halvings.\n\nBitcoin halvings are a major part of the BTC protocol, aiming to decrease the quantity of the new coins entering the network by [cutting the block reward in half](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter) every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years.\n\n**Factor 2: Bitcoin mining hardware characteristics**\n\nBitcoin mining profitability largely depends on the choice of a BTC mining device and related characteristics including hash rate, power consumption and price.\n\nHash rate is the processing power of a miner, measured in hashes per second (H/S). Higher hash rates include representations in kilohashes per second (KH/S), gigahashes per second (GH/S), terahashes per second (TH/S), exahashes per second (EH/S) and so on.\n\nA miner’s hash rate is the speed at which it can solve crypto mining puzzles to mine Bitcoin. The faster the speed, the more BTC is mined in a specific timeframe. As the [BTC hash rate is constantly breaking new highs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hash-rate-marks-all-time-high-as-btc-price-drops-below-25k), Bitcoin miner manufacturers regularly produce new mining devices supporting higher hash rates, while older miners apparently become obsolete over time.\n\nAnother important feature of a BTC mining device is the energy consumption. With rising global energy costs, a miner’s ability to consume less energy is essential.\n\nThe price of actual mining devices is also an important expense when calculating the BTC mining profitability. Both GPU and ASIC miners got cheaper amid the bear market this year, but brand new flagship miners still cost more than $11,000 at the time of writing.\n\n**Factor 3: Mining difficulty and hash rate**\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to mine a BTC block, with a higher difficulty requiring additional computing power to verify transactions and mine new coins.\n\nNetwork difficulty has been rising in 2022, [continually breaking new all-time highs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-network-difficulty-breaks-into-a-new-all-time-high-of-29-794t). Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, or about every two weeks, as Bitcoin is programmed to self-adjust in order to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes.\n\nThe Bitcoin hash rate is another fundamental metric for assessing the strength of the BTC network, as a higher hashrate means more computing power is required to verify and add transactions to the blockchain. This also makes BTC more secure because it would take more miners as well as more energy and time to take over the network.\n\n**Factor 4: Electricity costs**\n\nThe price of electricity is another important factor when calculating the profitability of BTC mining.\n\nMiners consider electricity prices in various countries in compliance with local crypto mining regulations. As mining activity puts [extra stress on a power grid](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-miners-in-texas-shut-down-operations-as-state-experiences-extreme-heat-wave), it’s important to double-check local requirements and specific energy prices for powering BTC miners in this or that country or region.\n\nBitcoin mining can be powered by many energy sources, both renewable like wind and solar and nonrenewable sources including fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Amid soaring energy prices caused by recent supply issues, miners should pay special attention to possible implications on BTC mining income when using nonrenewable energy.\n\n**Factor 5: Pool fee if not mining solo**\n\nMany Bitcoin miners prefer to join mining pools instead of working as individual miners. That is a way to combine their computing power and increase the chances of finding a block and mining BTC faster.\n\nPool miners should be aware of another small expense that is taken by pool admins that set up the software for this type of mining. The fee is generally 1-3% of the miner’s individual reward, depending on the pool.\n\n**Factor 6: Other expenses**\n\nBitcoin mining expenses are not exclusive to ASICs and GPUs and network indicators. BTC mining may also require some additional investment related to the physical mining setup, including facilities and property that are a good fit. Significant expenses may include cooling or noise canceling equipment as some miner machines are associated with a [massive amount of heat and noise pollution](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-lawmakers-sound-alarm-to-epa-over-environment-concerns-of-crypto-mining).\n\n## Crypto mining calculators\n\nOne of the easiest ways to calculate Bitcoin mining profitability based on all the listed factors is using online BTC mining calculators.\n\nDesigned to simplify the process of calculating Bitcoin mining profitability, a BTC mining calculator predicts the approximate mining income based on inputs like BTC price, hash rate, electricity price and others.\n\nLet’s take an example of calculating Bitcoin mining profitability with a brand new Bitmain ASIC Antminer S19 Pro using the BTC mining calculator by crypto market data provider CryptoCompare.\n\nAntminer S19 Pro has a maximum hashrate of 110TH/s and power consumption of 3250W. Let’s assume that a miner’s pool fee is 2% and the miner is based in North Dakota, where the average residential electricity rate in 2022 [amounts](https://findenergy.com/nd/#:\\~:text=North%20Dakota's%20Electricity%20Prices%20and,based%20on%20average%20electricity%20rate.) to roughly $0.11, versus the United States national average price of roughly $0.14.\n\n***Related: [BTC mining costs reach 10-month lows as miners use more efficient rigs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-mining-costs-reach-10-month-lows-as-miners-use-more-efficient-rigs)***\n\nGiven these variables, the daily profit ratio accounts for 27%, with possible BTC mining profits [amounting](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=110&HashingUnit=TH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=3250&CostPerkWh=0.11&MiningPoolFee=2) to $70 per month, or $840 per year, according to CryptoCompare. In contrast, given the U.S. national average electricity price of $0.14, the daily profit ratio [amounts](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=110&HashingUnit=TH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=3250&CostPerkWh=0.14&MiningPoolFee=2) to 0% or even generates a loss with the current BTC price and other network indicators.", "timestamp": 1658588952, "digest": "qKr-Ok260d0dA2dSWjf8DYLYKTTSrp0TpkNyk_51Ja8", "contributor": "0x52CEb287BEb81D61eDf413A8B3007b611E8917EA"}

{"id": "LdxXt_uPHTGaufibnyHfNwgRzecumcb4tmUToUVC8kk", "title": "Proof-of-time vs proof-of-stake: How the two algorithms compare", "body": "Consensus algorithms are processes where validators (also known as nodes or miners) within a blockchain network agree on the current state of the network. This mainly entails agreeing on whether a transaction submitted by a validator is authentic. Fraudulent or inaccurate transactions are rejected by the network assuming all validators are acting fairly with no malicious intent. Validators are rewarded with cryptocurrency for submitting accurate and authentic transactions, whilst malicious actors are penalized depending on the consensus protocol. \n\nFor example, in proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)), [validators have to spend energy](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained) via expensive hardware to validate transactions, and if successful, they gain new tokens. If they act maliciously they gain nothing and the loss comes from [the wasted energy used](https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work:-differences-explained) in submitting the fraudulent or inaccurate transaction.\n\nIn proof-of-stake (PoS) [users stake tokens](https://cointelegraph.com/news/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-for-scaling-blockchains) and receive additional tokens for submitting authentic transactions, while losing a portion for submitting wrong transactions.\n\nIn proof-of-time (PoT) protocols the principle is the same, with validators receiving additional tokens for submitting authentic transactions but lose tokens for submitting inaccurate or malicious transactions.\n\nWhile PoS and PoT share some similarities, they are two very different protocols.\n\n## What is proof-of-stake?\n\nPoS is a consensus algorithm that works by users staking their tokens as collateral by locking them into a smart contract. The system works by selecting a validator, also known as miners or nodes, to process a block of transactions. The validator has to validate the transactions inside the block to ensure that there is no inaccurate information contained within.\n\nNext, the validator submits the block to the blockchain and if the block has been validated correctly, they receive additional tokens as a reward. If a validator behaves in a malicious or lazy manner, usually by submitting incorrect or fraudulent transactions, they lose a portion of the tokens they have staked.\n\nValidators who staked a higher amount of tokens are more likely to be selected to verify transactions. Staking a higher amount of tokens also earns the validator additional rewards since they typically earn a fixed percentage based on the blockchain network. For example on Ethereum 2.0, validators currently [earn](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/) 4.2% on their tokens. Validators are also more likely to be selected if they have staked their tokens for a longer period of time.\n\nBecoming a validator in the PoS system is open to everyone but the barrier to entry is high due to the popularity of the protocol, with a large number of nodes on PoS blockchains. The more nodes a network has, the larger amount of tokens a user will need to stake to become a validator.\n\nDue to this, [staking pools](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/understanding-staking-pools-the-pros-and-cons-of-staking-cryptocurrency), which are run by validators, are typically used by average crypto users who want to stake their tokens. In this system, a user deposits their tokens into a pool and the tokens are staked by validators on the token owner’s behalf. In return for this, users typically pay a “pool fee,” which is a percentage of the tokens they earn from staking.\n\n## What is proof-of-time?\n\nProof-of-time (PoT) is a consensus algorithm that uses a voting system to choose network validators and focuses on how long a network validator has been active within the network as well as their reputation. The protocol was developed by [Analog](https://www.analog.one/) and is based on [delegated proof-of-stake](https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-pos-to-dbft-a-brief-review-of-consensus-protocols) (dPoS) which is a modified version of PoS.\n\nProof-of-time refers to its ledger as a Timechain and works by using a ranking score, verifiable delay function (VDF), and staked tokens to determine who gets to add a new transaction to the ledger. The ranking system works by giving a score to network validators based on their age and past performance. Validators receive higher scores for being trustworthy and being active within the network for a longer time.

The survey revealed that “this problem is particularly acute in Japan, where 4 in 10 consumers have low trust in NFT marketplaces.”\n\nDespite the geopolitical differences, investors from all four countries unanimously agreed on the need for stricter regulations on NFTs, considering factors including age restrictions and risk tolerances.\n\nAcross the US, UK, Japan and Brazil, 58% of sports fans believe to have some level of understanding regarding NFTs.

This mainly entails agreeing on whether a transaction submitted by a validator is authentic. Fraudulent or inaccurate transactions are rejected by the network assuming all validators are acting fairly with no malicious intent. Validators are rewarded with cryptocurrency for submitting accurate and authentic transactions, whilst malicious actors are penalized depending on the consensus protocol. \n\nFor example, in proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)), [validators have to spend energy](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained) via expensive hardware to validate transactions, and if successful, they gain new tokens. If they act maliciously they gain nothing and the loss comes from [the wasted energy used](https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work:-differences-explained) in submitting the fraudulent or inaccurate transaction.\n\nIn proof-of-stake (PoS) [users stake tokens](https://cointelegraph.com/news/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-for-scaling-blockchains) and receive additional tokens for submitting authentic transactions, while losing a portion for submitting wrong transactions.\n\nIn proof-of-time (PoT) protocols the principle is the same, with validators receiving additional tokens for submitting authentic transactions but lose tokens for submitting inaccurate or malicious transactions.\n\nWhile PoS and PoT share some similarities, they are two very different protocols.\n\n## What is proof-of-stake?\n\nPoS is a consensus algorithm that works by users staking their tokens as collateral by locking them into a smart contract. The system works by selecting a validator, also known as miners or nodes, to process a block of transactions. The validator has to validate the transactions inside the block to ensure that there is no inaccurate information contained within.\n\nNext, the validator submits the block to the blockchain and if the block has been validated correctly, they receive additional tokens as a reward. If a validator behaves in a malicious or lazy manner, usually by submitting incorrect or fraudulent transactions, they lose a portion of the tokens they have staked.\n\nValidators who staked a higher amount of tokens are more likely to be selected to verify transactions. Staking a higher amount of tokens also earns the validator additional rewards since they typically earn a fixed percentage based on the blockchain network. For example on Ethereum 2.0, validators currently [earn](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/) 4.2% on their tokens. Validators are also more likely to be selected if they have staked their tokens for a longer period of time.\n\nBecoming a validator in the PoS system is open to everyone but the barrier to entry is high due to the popularity of the protocol, with a large number of nodes on PoS blockchains. The more nodes a network has, the larger amount of tokens a user will need to stake to become a validator.\n\nDue to this, [staking pools](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/understanding-staking-pools-the-pros-and-cons-of-staking-cryptocurrency), which are run by validators, are typically used by average crypto users who want to stake their tokens. In this system, a user deposits their tokens into a pool and the tokens are staked by validators on the token owner’s behalf. In return for this, users typically pay a “pool fee,” which is a percentage of the tokens they earn from staking.\n\n## What is proof-of-time?\n\nProof-of-time (PoT) is a consensus algorithm that uses a voting system to choose network validators and focuses on how long a network validator has been active within the network as well as their reputation. The protocol was developed by [Analog](https://www.analog.one/) and is based on [delegated proof-of-stake](https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-pos-to-dbft-a-brief-review-of-consensus-protocols) (dPoS) which is a modified version of PoS.\n\nProof-of-time refers to its ledger as a Timechain and works by using a ranking score, verifiable delay function (VDF), and staked tokens to determine who gets to add a new transaction to the ledger. The ranking system works by giving a score to network validators based on their age and past performance. Validators receive higher scores for being trustworthy and being active within the network for a longer time. Staking a larger amount of tokens also makes it more likely that a validator will be selected.\n\n***Recent: [FTX CEO and Solana co-founder offer advice for building Web3 ecosystems](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-ceo-and-solana-co-founder-offer-advice-for-building-web3-ecosystems)***\n\nPoT is similar to dPoS since users on the network vote to decide which delegates can validate the next block.

The reduced difficulty allows Bitcoin miners to confirm transactions using lower resources, enabling smaller miners a fighting chance to earn the mining rewards.\n\nDespite the minor setback, zooming out on blockchain.com’s [data](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) reveals that Bitcoin continues to operate as the most resilient and immutable blockchain network. While the difficulty adjustment is directly proportional to the hashing power of miners, the total hash rate (TH/s) recovered 3.2% along similar timelines, as shown below.\n\nAt its peak, the Bitcoin hash rate reached an all-time high of 231.428 exahash per second (EH/s) when BTC prices fell to $25,000 last month in June — raising momentary concerns around extensive power usage. \n\nEver since China banned all crypto trading and mining operations in June 2021, the United States picked up slack in becoming the highest contributor to the global Bitcoin hash rate. However, Chinese miners resumed operations in September 2021. According to Statista [data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1200477/bitcoin-mining-by-country/), the US represents 37.84% of the global hash rate, followed by China at 21.11% and Kazakhstan at 13.22%.\n\nPreviously, Cointelegraph reported that meteoric drop in GPU prices have opened up a small window of [opportunity for small-time miners](https://cointelegraph.com/news/global-gpu-price-drops-to-compensate-for-falling-bitcoin-mining-revenue) to procure a piece of more powerful and efficient mining equipment. That being said, miners see falling GPU prices as a means to offset their operational costs amid an ongoing bear market.\n\n***Related: [Sustainable Bitcoin mining power mix hits 59.5%: BTC Mining Council](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sustainable-bitcoin-mining-power-mix-hits-59-5-btc-mining-council)***\n\nEasing up concerns related to exorbitant power usage, a report released by the Bitcoin Mining Council uncovered that nearly 60% of the electricity used for BTC mining comes from sustainable sources.\n\nThe study also found that BTC mining accounted for just 0.09% of the 34.8 billion metric tons of carbon emissions estimated to be produced globally and consumed just 0.15% of the global energy supply.", "timestamp": 1658589783, "digest": "KsKFC00BF7RqC-6w2cYyJohoXZ0BKBTeWbvX_nMNsBc", "contributor": "0x5419AEF6D232A2168bEa5d9418C86493990c81e1"}

`，了解您可以使用 EVMOS 代币做什么。\n\n## 我现在有 Evmos 代币。做什么？\n\n认领 Rektdrop 后，您的帐户中就有 Evmos 代币。Evmos 代币充当使用 Evmos 网络的货币。你可以用这种数字货币做很多事情：\n\n## 支付Gas费\n\n您可以在账户之间发送代币并通过签署交易与 dApp 进行交互。网络上的每笔交易都需要您支付少量费用，称为汽油费。我们建议您始终在您的账户中保留少量 Evmos 代币以支付gas费。\n\n## 与 Evmos dApp Store 上的 dApp 互动\n\n您可以使用 Evmos 代币与 Evmos 上的 dApp 进行交互。更准确地说，您通过将交易发送到已由 dApp 开发人员在 Evmos 上部署的[智能合约来与 dApp 进行交互。](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp)将智能合约视为 dApp 开发人员需要设置以定义其应用程序如何工作的规则集合（“如果发生这种情况，请执行此操作……”）。例如，专注于交换代币的 dApp 将部署一个智能合约，该合约在收到交易时将一个代币换成另一个代币。\n\n使用 MetaMask 钱包连接到其网站上的 dApp 并签署交易以与其智能合约进行交互。使用 Evmos 上的 dApp，您将能够使用去中心化交易所、交易 NFT、通过流动资金池获得奖励等。\n\n了解哪些 dApp 部署在 Evmos 上并将成为 Evmos dApp 商店的一部分！查看`APPS ON EVMOS`仪表板上的部分或在以下位置找到更全面的去中心化应用程序列表\n\n* <https://github.com/tharsis/awesome>或\n* [https://evmos.space](https://evmos.space/)。\n\n更多 dApp 将成为 Evmos dApp Store 的一部分，因为每次有人与其智能合约交互时，它们都可以在 Evmos 上获得奖励。此外，由于 Evmos 完全兼容 EVM，因此可以在 Evmos 上部署以太坊和其他 EVM 链上的 dApp，而无需更改其智能合约。这使得迁移到 Evmo 变得非常容易。\n\n## 探索 Cosmos 生态系统\n\n[Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)也称为 `Internet of Blockchains`由许多可以相互通信的区块链组成，例如将代币从一条链发送到另一条链。Evmos 是 Cosmos 的一部分，因此您可以将 Evmos 代币发送到其他 Cosmos 链。\n\n目前，在 Cosmos 上部署了[数百个 dApp](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps/)，通过 Evmos，您可以与 Cosmos 和 Evmos 上的应用程序进行交互。这很新颖，因为 Evmos 和 Cosmos 上的 dApp 构建在不同的底层系统上 — — 将它们视为不同的操作系统（例如 Mac 和 Windows）。这使得 Evmo 成为其他 EVM 兼容链（如以太坊）流动性的入口。用户将能够将代币从以太坊转移到 Evmos，并利用 Cosmos 的低汽油费。如果您想了解更多有关其工作原理的信息，请查看我们关于 ERC-20 模块的博文。\n\n## 质押\n\n如本指南中所述，您可以使用 Evmos [Dashboard](https://gotrekt.com/mission-control)通过将代币质押给验证者并将其锁定来质押您的代币。质押您的 Evmos 代币可以获得为 Evmos 链提供经济安全性的奖励[。](https://cosmos.network/learn/staking)你基本上是因为提供流动性而获得利息。请注意，当您取消对代币的委托时，有两周的解除绑定期，在此期间代币仍处于锁定状态。在此期间之后，您的代币将再次出现在您的账户余额中。\n\n质押的回报是通过[通货膨胀](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/inflation/01_concepts.html#inflation)提供的。特别是在网络的早期阶段，质押奖励非常高，可以激励质押，从而保护网络。随着更多的质押者，网络变得越来越稳定和分散。它变得*稳定*是因为资产被锁定而不是通过交易引起价格变化。它变得去*中心化*，因为投票治理提案的权力被分配给更多人。\n\n有关更多信息，请查看我们的[代币模型](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b)，了解代币供应如何随时间变化。\n\n## 投票\n\n对 Evmos 区块链的任何更改都受链上治理的约束。这意味着 Evmos 社区中的每个人都可以投票决定提议的更改是否应该通过。这些更改通常会建议对区块链进行更新，以添加新功能、修复错误或更改模块参数（例如每年的通货膨胀量）。\n\n通过为治理提案投票，让社区听到您的声音。此外，如果您投票支持特定的治理提案，新链通常会将您包括在他们的空投中。\n\n真挚地，\n\nEvmos 的宇航员🌋\n\n## 免责声明\n\n你不应该在钱包之间导出你的私钥或助记词。如果您想使用一个钱包而不是另一个，您可以转移您的余额。交易费用是为安全支付的一小笔费用。\n\n您可能会发现 Evmos 团队未提供的其他声明指南或仪表板。确保仅使用<https://gotrekt.com/>上的官方 Evmos 仪表板来执行您的 Rektdrop 索赔。\n\n## 在下面跟随我们的旅程\n\n💻 开发者文档：[https ://evmos.dev/](https://evmos.dev/)\n\n👾 官方 Discord：[https ://discord.gg/trje9XuAmy](https://discord.gg/trje9XuAmy)\n\n🐙 GitHub：[https ://github.com/tharsis/evmos](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos)\n\n🕊 推特：[https ://twitter.com/EvmosOrg](https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg)\n\n📯 电报：[@EvmosOrg](https://t.me/EvmosOrg)\n\n📯 电报(华语)：<https://t.me/evmos_zh>\n\n📄 媒体：[https ://evmos.blog/](https://evmos.blog/)\n\n***原文：<https://evmos.blog/claiming-your-evmos-rektdrop-10daead868a8>***\n\n**NodeStake是专业的Evmos节点验证者，质押到节点NodeStake有80%的返利空投，[详情点击](https://twitter.com/Nodestake_top/status/1542056703369580544))**\n\n\n---\n\n关注推特[@NodeStake_top](https://twitter.com/Nodestake_top)，获取更多资讯", "timestamp": 1658590446, "digest": "8qEe89rjHFfGcy7B5wu_c0u1rmvSBSstDakMiH_ccyY", "contributor": "0xDb8Eb119800a162017E669Ccc5910cd65d6Ff96A"}

BitKeep）五位嘉宾参与圆桌讨论，这是 0x499 旗下 DeTalks 第 26 期，主持人是 Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor），以下是直播内容精彩摘录：**\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n感谢大家今天抽出宝贵的事件参加 0x499 举办的 Twitter Space，这一期的主题是：社区发起的 NFT 项目能成为新的投资热点吗？，我们邀请了几位嘉宾一起来讨论这个问题，首先有请他们做一下自我介绍：\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n大家好，我是一名艺术家，之前在 Web2 的经历包括跟 Nike、Apple 合作一些活动，也在国际上出过几本书，我在 Web3 的身份是前 Opensea 的社区经理，这段时间也在做自己的 NFT 项目叫做 Magic forest no sleep。希望有机会跟大家多多交流跟学习。\n\n**Kevin（Founder of BitKeep）**\n\n大家好，BitKeep 是一个跨链钱包，用一个私钥管理所有公链，内置了 Swap 功能和交易功能，比 Opensea 交易手续费便宜很多，很高兴有机会跟大家一起交流。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\n大家好，OKX NFT 同时支持以太坊、Solana、BSN 等多条链，其次是有 INO 一级市场的 Launchpad，不定期会有热门项目做首发；最后就是我们二级市场是不收手续费的，这个对用户来说还是比较友好的。很感谢今天有机会跟大家一起交流。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n我们是一支专注 Web3 投资的风险基金，除了做一级的风险投资以外，也有一个二级部门做量化交易，还有一些矿场，公司成员主要在北京、上海、美国加州和新加坡。关于 NFT 领域有一个 BCA 部门，上个月 NYC NFT 大会也去了很多工作人员。我们是比较注重投后生态建设的 Web3 基金，很高兴能够多和大家探讨关于 NFT 一些问题。\n\n**Will Wang（BAI partner）**\n\n贝达斯曼是一个两百年的家族企业，我们主要的业务是各种各样的电视台、出版社和音乐版权，年收入大概 1000 多亿人民币。所有的 Web3 报告都把我们描述成一家 Web1 公司，因为业务确实极度传统，但是现在好巧不巧集团内部大概有 30 个部门都在做 NFT 有关的事情，我们有世界上各种各样内容的版权库。我们在中国做 TMT 产业投资做了 14 年，各种大家用到的探探、keep、叮咚买菜都是我们投的，我们熟悉互联网生态，最近也开始积极关注 Web3，在 NFT 这块也投了几个内容方，海外投了一个类似 Outland 的平台，但是最近还是在关注基础设施层面的变化，尤其是什么样的基础设施下一步能够把几亿人 onboard 到 Web3 里面去。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**从数据上来看，上周 NFT 整体市值经历了一个单边上涨的过程，从 220 亿美金涨到了 240 亿美金左右，你认为这种上涨是由于 ETH 价格回弹造成的，还是有 NFT 市场本身的因素在里面？**\n\n**Kevin（Founder of BitKeep）**\n\n其实整体环境不仅仅是加密市场在上涨，证券市场也在反弹，虽说目前还在加息周期里面，但波动还是有的。首先不能回避的是，今天是一个全球化市场，所有资产品种是联动的，这个是必须考虑的，而不是说单单考虑比如说以太坊转 pos 这个因素，我们倾向于认为这个市场还是在转暖，但是为什么 NFT 表现特别好，背景是资金肯定会流向潜在回报率最高的方向，像今天 crypto 盘子，NFT 占比太小，但是从 BitKeep 的数据来看，NFT 的广度和共识基础其实一点都不弱于 Token，资金一直以来都是最聪明的，会去找相对低估的资产下注参与，很多 NFT 项目不需要太多资金就可以把地板价拉起来，交易深度比较浅，当你有这个效应的时候，一定会吸引更多人进来。\n\n在过去两三年里面有很多 Token 项目，其实没有太多创新，大家还是在回归和建设以太坊，总体来说没有大赛道诞生，但是 NFT 的火热吸引了太多优秀的创业者进来，这是一个趋势，我们是持续看好这个领域的。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n我个人觉得，NFT 整体市值的回暖，可能还是因为 ETH 和整个 Crypto 市场的上涨，从交易量来看的话，NFT 是下降的，但是从交易金额来看是上涨的。单独看 NFT 市场的话，目前来看并不算特别火爆，因为成交量还是在比较低的区间徘徊，如果等到下一个比较好的空间，NFT 应该是交易量上涨的，但是目前来说还没有看到。\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n经历过牛市和熊市的周期之后，大家都会倾向于在熊市中沉淀下来做东西，所以经过最近一段时间的累计开始爆发，除了大型项目之外也有很多个人项目艺术项目的崛起，很多艺术项目踊跃出现的同时，份额也在增长。另外就是一些蓝筹项目一直在做事情，一直有惊喜，保持整个市场的热度，当你有一个龙头大哥在做事情的时候，也会带动大家的信心，让更多人重新进来。最后是 NFT 有很多玩法，最近的一个玩法是 Freemint，会吸引重来没有玩过 NFT 的一大批新玩家入场，这几个因素看过来就发现 NFT 市场有一点回暖。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\n其实整个 NFT 市值按照以太坊本位是跌了，NFT 没有涨太多，以太坊确实是涨得比较好，带动了整个 NFT 成交金额和市值反弹。过去一到两周，Opensea 成交量和成交金额基本上还是比较稳定，今天倒是涨了不少，有可能是市场传导需要时间，二级市场反弹后，大家情绪好一些，项目的准备也要一定时间，所以可能未来一段时间 ETH 保持比较好的价格的话，有可能 NFT  会有一个不错的窗口。\n\n接下来 NFT 市场会有一定分化，我自己观察蓝筹并没有太涨，甚至还跌了一些，但是有一些社区主导和 Freemint 的项目，不管是从成交量和交易人数上都有不错的表现，可能是整体熊市周期，大家情绪出现的这么一个短期趋势。另外国内数字藏品这一块最近也不是太好，会有一部分用户可能会进来。\n\n**0x499**\n\n**我们都知道 NFT 流动性比较差，一级市场到二级市场的传导需要时间和过程。虽然我们从数据上看，NFT 二级市场成交量依然没有回升，想问问从各位嘉宾得到的信息来看，近期  NFT 一级市场最近表现如何？**\n\n**Kevin（Founder of BitKeep）**\n\n首先要说的是，一级市场的本质是逆周期投资，你是不能指望在牛市去投一级市场的，一定是在熊市去投有潜力的项目，所以说一级市场是非常活跃的。在过去一年半时间里面，以很多蓝筹项目为样本，释放了一个非常让人惊喜的可能性，是让我们非常惊讶的。这个市场的发展是要持续的，现在 NFT 项目几乎都是在以太坊，但是它交互成本这么高，其实是受限的，而且现在没有类似于中心化的平台来降低成本，流动性非常差，当你能够解决流动性问题的时候，市场的活跃和热情就会释放出来。\n\n第二个，NFT 大致的发展方向，比如为社区赋能，比如 pass card 增加各种各样的权益，这也是被认定的，逐渐走向成熟化。从这个角度来看，一级市场的火爆是有理由的，特别是游戏团队出来做的项目。大家知道 STEPN 已经是一个市值几十亿美金的公司，就是一个小团队，全亚洲超过 10 亿美金的 crypto 项目也没几个，所以整个市场中 GameFi NFT 项目是非常受到追捧的。我们最近也看到很多传统 Web2 游戏制作团队进来，所以我是非常看好未来的发展。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n二级市场在交易量来说最近还是没有回升，还是在低位震荡，但是从一级市场来说还是挺火热的。虽然投资笔数不如去年大环境好的时候，但是大家讨论还是比较火热的。现在一级市场投资最多的事 GameFi 品类，从这个角度来说 NFT 也可以跟社交关联起来。这就是为什么大家都很看好的逻辑，因为不管是 GameFi 还是 SocialFi，NFT 都在里面扮演很重要的角色，比如说游戏领域，卡牌游戏武器装备都是 NFT，SocialFi 的主题身份都是 NFT 形式，有点像头像 PFP，有一定的社交属性，我们都是猴子持有人，就是一个社群的人，所以像这种 NFT 一级市场是很看好它的未来。\n\n一级市场到二级市场有一个传导的过程，而且一级市场有一个逆周期效应，熊市中看比较好的潜力项目，牛市中反而可能有退出的想法，其实我们现在看去年比较火的 axie 和 bayc，诞生的时间也没有那么超前，axie 是 2018 年熊市中创业，2021 年 GameFi 的爆发起来了，bayc 无聊猿是在 2021 年上半年创业，后来火爆起来的。一级市场除了本身投 NFT 项目外，也在关注更多好的玩法，比如说提供更好的流动性，让交易更加丝滑，比如说 DeFi、质押偏金融类的玩法也在引进来，所以这也是 NFT 项目比较受一级市场关注的原因。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\nNFT 一级市场最近确实回来了很多，6月份的时候我印象其实没有什么新项目，当时还有 NFT NYC，都没有什么新项目出来 mint，最近项目方和社区热情回升了很多，有些项目 mint 完二级市场表现还是不错的，不管是交易量还是价格上，明显比上个月好很多。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**艺术赛道 NFT 常常出现在 opensea 前 20 榜单，我们常常看到发行 500 或者 1000 的艺术作品，大家如何看待这样的情况，是不是 PFP 的赛道会被艺术 NFT 切掉一部分市场？**\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n我觉得 PFP 和艺术越来越没有一个明确的界限，比如说我自己是艺术家，做艺术 NFT 项目，但是我也会尝试把艺术性 PFP 项目做起来，也有很多 PFP 项目会偏向艺术性，所以两者应该在一个融合期。因为最近 PFP 项目多了之后，还是想有一些艺术性的回归，因为确实市场就是 PFP 项目太多了，但是怎么在这些项目里面给一个故事性，都是一个营销手段。\n\n一级市场我看到越来越多艺术项目得到社区和平台的支持，以我的个人项目为例，OKX 前段时间也跟我们有活动，包括跟其他社区一起 AMA 等等，虽然有句话叫做熊市抱团，但是我觉得是大家再造一个好的生态，无论是对 PFP 还是艺术项目都处于包容性阶段。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**各位最近有没有看到 NFT 市场上一些新的玩法？可以结合具体项目举例。**\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n最近看到一个项目我其实挺喜欢的，背后的技术是一个台湾的 DAO 团队，它其实也是一个偏动画、偏艺术的项目，你持有 NFT 可以参与在网站做出投票，影响故事线的发展，投票的过程也是一个质押，现在已经发展到第三阶段，每一次都提前告诉你选择的时间，holder有一个期待性，他们也会有一些空投，空投的东西同样会出现在故事线，这是最近我还挺留意的项目，因为我自己会比较喜欢能够共同参与的项目。上个月我去 NFT NYC 现场，会发现做 Web3 跟用户之间真正有互动是很难做到的。\n\n另外一个就是想提一下我自己的项目，我们也是借鉴了挺多蓝筹项目，很多 Holder 还是有参与感和互动形式，接下来我们会尝试做更多衍生物，通过 NFT 质押的方式让 Holder 可以拥有实体，所以我个人也是挺期待的。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n关于新的玩法最近有两个还挺火的，一个是黑猫 MIMIC SHHANS ，还有一个是 Soulda。我发现大家还蛮喜欢拿来做头像的，这个势头和速度比之前的蓝筹还要快，可能是因为价格比较低，最开始只需要二三十美金，另外也因为黑猫社群听说有一起运营的情况，团结度还是蛮高的。所以我在想在 NFT 领域，市场运营的作用其实是很大程度上超过图片质量，早期的时候大家认为 Azuki 画风非常符合亚洲人审美，但是后来开始变得市场化运作，虽然图片质量没有那么好，但是大家都在用，比如说哥布林，在当时很熊的情况下引发了一个小火爆。所以当下很多项目确实可以关注市场运营，有没有一些推陈出新的玩法。\n\n关于 NFT 质押和流动性，现在也有很多团队在关注。比如说我拿一个猴子，我可以质押给平台，拿出 5-10w 的流动，这部分玩法也在推陈出新，包括 NFT 借贷、租赁，这个市场确实现在看还是日新月异的。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**对比其他类型 NFT，你怎么看待艺术 NFT 未来的发展趋势？**\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n我算是比较早进入 NFT 市场的藏家，我觉得市场总是有一个循环流动性，并不会总是偏向某一种 NFT 项目，可能正好就是最近一些特别大的艺术家进来的时候，也会鼓励一些中小艺术家去发项目。比如说 Outland 前段时间有方力钧，蔡国强，有这些前辈的借鉴，会有越来越多的艺术家愿意进入这个市场。\n\n艺术项目可能会是下一个投资的方向，因为艺术 NFT 会随着艺术家本身的增值而增值，比如说又多了一个 layer 的玩法，很多艺术项目也会提供类似 pass 的权益赋能，我自己也是这么做的。另外虽然是个人艺术项目，但是背后技术团队也是很可以的，最近我们有一个技术上突破，在智能合约盲盒抽取上面，现在邀请我的小伙伴介绍一下。\n\n**Chase-eth.eth**\n\n我是在 Chainlink Labs 做分析师，平时就是看一些项目的投资和孵化。跟 Popil 老师认识也是在一个投资的小会里面，聊着聊着就发现她这个 NFT 项目里面，我们是有很多技术支持可以帮他们做的，特别是在开盲盒这个角度。可能懂技术的知道，如果你是在链上生成随机数的话，很容易被矿工进行篡改，篡改之后影响这个社区的空投公平性，ChainLink 开发了一个 VR-F 的解决方案，主要是结合链上链下完整及时，达到一个链上产生可验证随机数的机制，来支持所有的空投和 GameFi 等需要达到公平性的功能。\n\nVR-F 之前也跟 BAYC 合作过，他们去空投都会用我们这一条技术，这个社区反响蛮好的，所以说在技术大家可以放心，这也算是我们给 Popil 老师项目的一个背书。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**近期一些热门 NFT 项目如 Soulda、Mimic 开始去中心化运作，强调社区自治。其实在 Azuki 创始人因为一篇推文引发公关危机、mfers 创始人高调隐退之后，这个趋势越来越明显，你是怎么看待这种转变的？**\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n社区固然是很必要，但是不是在项目发行之前必须存在，这也是我的一个疑问。因为你会发现我自己的项目很特别的一点是没有去做 Discord，我们有可能会在发行之后去做，因为我会在项目发行之前做好整个项目的布置和智能合约的运营上面，而不是把时间消耗在经营社区这边，因为很多项目在发行之前有社区文化在建立，这一点非常好，但同时也可能会消耗整个项目的趋势。我自己也在观察大大小小各种项目，有些可能太投入精力在经营社区，整个调性和周期就冷却了。\n\n所以我自己是觉得，首先项目你要有自己的特性，第二点是当项目拥有一定社群的时候再去回馈你的社区，或许也是一个模型的改变，因为我发现越来越多喜欢的项目，刚好有其他蓝筹同时发行，大家可能就不关注了，这一点是很可惜的。有时候社区非常强大，但是因为投入过多时间经营社区，把自己的发行计划拖慢的情况也会有，所以我觉得两者之前需要一个平衡。\n\n**Will Wang（BAI partner）**\n\n我买 Soulda 确实是因为它的艺术性，当时看到网站做得那么好看，所以纯粹是看到有新闻报道，看到产品觉得这个还是挺花心思的。但是我一开始也很疑惑，因为每个人都 mint 了属于自己性格的 NFT，那是否具备可交易性，如果买别人的 NFT 意义在哪里。后来发现有一些自己买下来的好像最后过去查，真的跟自己做的题目挺符合的，所以这个项目无论是在设计上还是在细节优化上做得特别好。但是如果真要把这个行业做得偏艺术性的话，其实很多艺术家是挑藏家的，但是社区之类的项目对挑藏家这件事是很难做到的，这就是很多项目不可持续的原因，因为你的核心藏家圈层不固定，导致受到市场行情的影响，大家显得非常浮躁。\n\n第二个维度是我们怎么看社区。社区的核心是前人栽树后人乘凉，是需要有人留下一些好东西的。但是现在很多社区只不过就是大家忙着去做一些小图片，或者是让其他人进入这个圈子，这个不叫社区，这是非常幼稚低劣的东西。很多好的东西是不需要社区的，甚至连迪士尼这样的公司是不需要社区的，是因为内容产生方式是不需要社区的。\n\n所以我们需要反过来想，有社区，内容产生是否可以跟社区联系起来，所以我觉得 soulda 有可能是开了这个先河，它的每个 NFT 都相当于是 Holder 产生的内容，这是一个很小的尝试，也算一个小小的进步。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\n之前的 NFT 也是社区驱动的，我觉得之所以现在的一些项目变成社区驱动，只不过是由之前西方出道、Discord 出道变成了在中国人、微信群出道的。至少对我来说是这样的，比如说当年去玩一些项目的时候，老外社区也是非常火的。在我个人看来，如果讨论的是 PFP 和艺术 NFT 的话，社区本身就是 NFT 的价值所在，所以必然是非常重要的。我们在挑项目的时候也是看它的社区和叙事，叙事就是 utility 的部分，绝大多数项目没有这个部分，所以就只剩下社区。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n从我的角度来看，社区自治是一个方式，并不一定代表好还是不好。对于 NFT 项目来说，核心还是要看内容产出其实是蛮重要的。我们看头部的 Yuga Labs 是一直在做事情的，他们很重视社区本身没有错，但是纯粹靠社区驱动，我觉得也不会有从最开始的 BAYC 到变异猿再到 Apecoin 再到猴子地，上周出来的 Otherside 短视频内测。\n\n其实如果有一个主创的正确导向的话，我觉得是能很好地带领大家往前走的作用，纯把这个交给社区，无论是 Azuki 还是 mfers NFT 地板价都出现了暴跌，反应出来的客观事实是大家对于这类事件的信心是下降的，所以引发很多人抛售，从这个角度讲，一个好的创始人不用那么大的权重，但是有一种精神上的带领，推动社区往前走，这个事情本身会更好一点。\n\n我自己判断有一个好的 founder 带领大家往前走，要优于纯粹的社区自治，社区自治更由于一个方向错误的 founder，所以社区自治更像是一个方式，不一定代表好和坏。包括我们看到比较头部的蓝筹项目，都是去中心化的免费发给大家，现在也有了一个相互收购过程。\n\nMIMIC SHHANS 黑猫早期的时候，我听说也有小批玩家，把市场运营路线规划好了，大家一起把社区炒起来，确实能够感觉到如果你买了，会有人给你点赞，然后 follow 你，就会越来越多的人开始加入这个社区，有更多认同感。所以我们看到的社区自治，可能不是纯粹的社区自治。\n\n**Kevin（Founder of BitKeep）**\n\n我觉得首先社区自治是所有 Crypto 的一个叙事，如果你违背这个叙事，说自己是一个公司运作，这样的事情在行业内是没有基础的。但是在实操过程中，我觉得社区自治是长期愿景而不是发行过程要通过它来完成。对于能够把社区自治这个东西讲好的所有 NFT 项目都有好感。在今天这么早期的阶段，必须要说社区自治是要经过时间检验的，BTC 还有一个核心开发小组的，我觉得很大的一个点是为了社区自治而自治，而是要承认它的叙事逻辑。\n\n我们不应该纠结，但是我依然觉得这是 Crypto 和传统世界最显著的标准，我们要为了社区自治，实现和传统世界所谓的同股同权的美好愿景去努力，而不是在成立的时候就要追求说我们所有人都是一样的，所有伟大的公司都是被强有力的核心团队推动的，或者说一个伟大的组织。如果做不到的项目，是不能称为一个 NFT  社区的。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**目前有一些 DAO 都是需要持有特定的 token 才能加入的，像 NFT 项目往社区化运作转型的话，其实特别适合 DAO 这样的协作方式，你怎么看待 NFT 和 DAO 的结合？**\n\n**Will Wang（BAI partner）**\n\n我自己买过的是 CityDAO，也很有意思，虽然好像他们做的唯一的事情就是在那块土地上插了根旗子拍了点照片，但也算是做了一些使用，把 NFT 收益权和投票权分开，因为有的人只想享受土地转卖的收益，有的人想参与到治理，更愿意来热情贡献，社区也奖励这样的行为，这些都是不多的试验。DAO 本身我自己有很强的偏见，我认为所有强调以人为组织的 DAO 是逃不过一个所谓非政府非营利组织半兼职组织的这种激励困境，我认为这不是 DAO 的精神，我们这个行业更强调的是 code is law ，我相信有很多事情，把权利交给 code，让 code 来执行是更有意思。所以我更喜欢协议驱动的 DAO，如果这种 DAO 需要 NFT 作为门槛的话，我也挺好奇会需要用到什么，很多时候可能就是因为你作为一个早期提供者，认可产品的理念去资助或者赞助，提升了很多 NFO、NPO 的效率，但是我一直不太认同 DAO 会颠覆公司制。\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n我最近发现 DAO 的形式在发生改变，我自己也在很多的 DAO，我发现其实我挺享受在 DAO 里面的交互过程，在一些社区里面自己在做项目的人，希望得到更多的认同和社交目的，我会在 DAO 里面遇到特别有意思的人，DAO 给了很多在从事 Web3 行业的朋友一个好的社区环境\n\n其实我最早是在 Pizza DAO，之前一年大家很喜欢支持他们做 Pizza 项目。DAO 的玩法一直在变，像现在的 DAO 可能会做一些 pass，像台湾给我们做技术的 DAO 正在推行一些把 Web2 和 Web3 连在一起的玩法。类似这样各种各样的 DAO 是另一个不同的生态，我自己来说是比较喜欢、也想自己去做一个 DAO，组织这些有经验、在社区层面有影响力的人组成一个保护 Web3 从业者的 DAO，在里面提供一些工作资源和海外资源，因为我发现国内项目打入到海外的话会欠缺一些玩法，很多 DAO 也有这样的限制，他们有很好的核心成员和输出，但是在过程中会遇到一些困难。所以我会想组建一个 DAO 帮助大家。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\n我们在聊 DAO 的时候，首先整个行业没有一个关于什么是 DAO 的共识，很多 DAO 只不过是拉了一个 discord channel，这件事情我理解可能是老外不知道有微信可以建群这个东西？我觉得 discord 去验证你是否持有 NFT 和微信群组去验资，实际上是蛮像的。所以你都可以把它叫做 DAO。你的 DAO 在区块链建立，最后应该是用 code 去治理的，在这个系统里面 NFT 应该是代表你的身份、声誉或者准入凭证。现在 NFT 和 DAO 都在非常早期的阶段，未来肯定是有很多融合的部分，目前来说还是应该把自己该做的事情做好。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n我一直觉得 DAO 的魅力，相较于我们传统的公司制，你感兴趣你去看，看了之后你觉得有一个点可以参与进来，你很容易就可以参与到其中，然后跟着组织一起去做事情。现在 NFT 社区有一种玩法，你持有 NFT 才可以加入进来，它就是在进出口卡了一道。但是我自己没有想清楚这个事情究竟是好还是不好，从我的角度上讲，很多 DAO 成员最开始是对你感兴趣，同时又不需要花费太多成本，能加入进来一起做事情，我很自由地进，同时如果觉得方向有问题，DAO 理念不太合适，可以很自由地退出，甚至有的还有代币回报，但这是一个很好推进事情的模式。\n\n如果是 NFT 社区作为 DAO 的基础，我是有点存疑，很多感兴趣的人没办法加入进来，被挡在了门外。未来如果真的能走出来比较好的结合的话，也是存在这些可能性的 。\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658590552, "digest": "mGaDXcnovkKP84G3wPt95DHNKIggMxBetyoMBStsLz8", "contributor":

NFT 项目能成为新的投资热点吗？，我们邀请了几位嘉宾一起来讨论这个问题，首先有请他们做一下自我介绍：\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n大家好，我是一名艺术家，之前在 Web2 的经历包括跟 Nike、Apple 合作一些活动，也在国际上出过几本书，我在 Web3 的身份是前 Opensea 的社区经理，这段时间也在做自己的 NFT 项目叫做 Magic forest no sleep。希望有机会跟大家多多交流跟学习。\n\n**Kevin（Founder of BitKeep）**\n\n大家好，BitKeep 是一个跨链钱包，用一个私钥管理所有公链，内置了 Swap 功能和交易功能，比 Opensea 交易手续费便宜很多，很高兴有机会跟大家一起交流。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\n大家好，OKX NFT 同时支持以太坊、Solana、BSN 等多条链，其次是有 INO 一级市场的 Launchpad，不定期会有热门项目做首发；最后就是我们二级市场是不收手续费的，这个对用户来说还是比较友好的。很感谢今天有机会跟大家一起交流。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n我们是一支专注 Web3 投资的风险基金，除了做一级的风险投资以外，也有一个二级部门做量化交易，还有一些矿场，公司成员主要在北京、上海、美国加州和新加坡。关于 NFT 领域有一个 BCA 部门，上个月 NYC NFT 大会也去了很多工作人员。我们是比较注重投后生态建设的 Web3 基金，很高兴能够多和大家探讨关于 NFT 一些问题。\n\n**Will Wang（BAI partner）**\n\n贝达斯曼是一个两百年的家族企业，我们主要的业务是各种各样的电视台、出版社和音乐版权，年收入大概 1000 多亿人民币。所有的 Web3 报告都把我们描述成一家 Web1 公司，因为业务确实极度传统，但是现在好巧不巧集团内部大概有 30 个部门都在做 NFT 有关的事情，我们有世界上各种各样内容的版权库。我们在中国做 TMT 产业投资做了 14 年，各种大家用到的探探、keep、叮咚买菜都是我们投的，我们熟悉互联网生态，最近也开始积极关注 Web3，在 NFT 这块也投了几个内容方，海外投了一个类似 Outland 的平台，但是最近还是在关注基础设施层面的变化，尤其是什么样的基础设施下一步能够把几亿人 onboard 到 Web3 里面去。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**从数据上来看，上周 NFT 整体市值经历了一个单边上涨的过程，从 220 亿美金涨到了 240 亿美金左右，你认为这种上涨是由于 ETH 价格回弹造成的，还是有 NFT 市场本身的因素在里面？**\n\n**Kevin（Founder of BitKeep）**\n\n其实整体环境不仅仅是加密市场在上涨，证券市场也在反弹，虽说目前还在加息周期里面，但波动还是有的。首先不能回避的是，今天是一个全球化市场，所有资产品种是联动的，这个是必须考虑的，而不是说单单考虑比如说以太坊转 pos 这个因素，我们倾向于认为这个市场还是在转暖，但是为什么 NFT 表现特别好，背景是资金肯定会流向潜在回报率最高的方向，像今天 crypto 盘子，NFT 占比太小，但是从 BitKeep 的数据来看，NFT 的广度和共识基础其实一点都不弱于 Token，资金一直以来都是最聪明的，会去找相对低估的资产下注参与，很多 NFT 项目不需要太多资金就可以把地板价拉起来，交易深度比较浅，当你有这个效应的时候，一定会吸引更多人进来。\n\n在过去两三年里面有很多 Token 项目，其实没有太多创新，大家还是在回归和建设以太坊，总体来说没有大赛道诞生，但是 NFT 的火热吸引了太多优秀的创业者进来，这是一个趋势，我们是持续看好这个领域的。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n我个人觉得，NFT 整体市值的回暖，可能还是因为 ETH 和整个 Crypto 市场的上涨，从交易量来看的话，NFT 是下降的，但是从交易金额来看是上涨的。单独看 NFT 市场的话，目前来看并不算特别火爆，因为成交量还是在比较低的区间徘徊，如果等到下一个比较好的空间，NFT 应该是交易量上涨的，但是目前来说还没有看到。\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n经历过牛市和熊市的周期之后，大家都会倾向于在熊市中沉淀下来做东西，所以经过最近一段时间的累计开始爆发，除了大型项目之外也有很多个人项目艺术项目的崛起，很多艺术项目踊跃出现的同时，份额也在增长。另外就是一些蓝筹项目一直在做事情，一直有惊喜，保持整个市场的热度，当你有一个龙头大哥在做事情的时候，也会带动大家的信心，让更多人重新进来。最后是 NFT 有很多玩法，最近的一个玩法是 Freemint，会吸引重来没有玩过 NFT 的一大批新玩家入场，这几个因素看过来就发现 NFT 市场有一点回暖。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\n其实整个 NFT 市值按照以太坊本位是跌了，NFT 没有涨太多，以太坊确实是涨得比较好，带动了整个 NFT 成交金额和市值反弹。过去一到两周，Opensea 成交量和成交金额基本上还是比较稳定，今天倒是涨了不少，有可能是市场传导需要时间，二级市场反弹后，大家情绪好一些，项目的准备也要一定时间，所以可能未来一段时间 ETH 保持比较好的价格的话，有可能 NFT  会有一个不错的窗口。\n\n接下来 NFT 市场会有一定分化，我自己观察蓝筹并没有太涨，甚至还跌了一些，但是有一些社区主导和 Freemint 的项目，不管是从成交量和交易人数上都有不错的表现，可能是整体熊市周期，大家情绪出现的这么一个短期趋势。另外国内数字藏品这一块最近也不是太好，会有一部分用户可能会进来。\n\n**0x499**\n\n**我们都知道 NFT 流动性比较差，一级市场到二级市场的传导需要时间和过程。虽然我们从数据上看，NFT 二级市场成交量依然没有回升，想问问从各位嘉宾得到的信息来看，近期  NFT 一级市场最近表现如何？**\n\n**Kevin（Founder of BitKeep）**\n\n首先要说的是，一级市场的本质是逆周期投资，你是不能指望在牛市去投一级市场的，一定是在熊市去投有潜力的项目，所以说一级市场是非常活跃的。在过去一年半时间里面，以很多蓝筹项目为样本，释放了一个非常让人惊喜的可能性，是让我们非常惊讶的。这个市场的发展是要持续的，现在 NFT 项目几乎都是在以太坊，但是它交互成本这么高，其实是受限的，而且现在没有类似于中心化的平台来降低成本，流动性非常差，当你能够解决流动性问题的时候，市场的活跃和热情就会释放出来。\n\n第二个，NFT 大致的发展方向，比如为社区赋能，比如 pass card 增加各种各样的权益，这也是被认定的，逐渐走向成熟化。从这个角度来看，一级市场的火爆是有理由的，特别是游戏团队出来做的项目。大家知道 STEPN 已经是一个市值几十亿美金的公司，就是一个小团队，全亚洲超过 10 亿美金的 crypto 项目也没几个，所以整个市场中 GameFi NFT 项目是非常受到追捧的。我们最近也看到很多传统 Web2 游戏制作团队进来，所以我是非常看好未来的发展。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n二级市场在交易量来说最近还是没有回升，还是在低位震荡，但是从一级市场来说还是挺火热的。虽然投资笔数不如去年大环境好的时候，但是大家讨论还是比较火热的。现在一级市场投资最多的事 GameFi 品类，从这个角度来说 NFT 也可以跟社交关联起来。这就是为什么大家都很看好的逻辑，因为不管是 GameFi 还是 SocialFi，NFT 都在里面扮演很重要的角色，比如说游戏领域，卡牌游戏武器装备都是 NFT，SocialFi 的主题身份都是 NFT 形式，有点像头像 PFP，有一定的社交属性，我们都是猴子持有人，就是一个社群的人，所以像这种 NFT 一级市场是很看好它的未来。\n\n一级市场到二级市场有一个传导的过程，而且一级市场有一个逆周期效应，熊市中看比较好的潜力项目，牛市中反而可能有退出的想法，其实我们现在看去年比较火的 axie 和 bayc，诞生的时间也没有那么超前，axie 是 2018 年熊市中创业，2021 年 GameFi 的爆发起来了，bayc 无聊猿是在 2021 年上半年创业，后来火爆起来的。一级市场除了本身投 NFT 项目外，也在关注更多好的玩法，比如说提供更好的流动性，让交易更加丝滑，比如说 DeFi、质押偏金融类的玩法也在引进来，所以这也是 NFT 项目比较受一级市场关注的原因。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\nNFT 一级市场最近确实回来了很多，6月份的时候我印象其实没有什么新项目，当时还有 NFT NYC，都没有什么新项目出来 mint，最近项目方和社区热情回升了很多，有些项目 mint 完二级市场表现还是不错的，不管是交易量还是价格上，明显比上个月好很多。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**艺术赛道 NFT 常常出现在 opensea 前 20 榜单，我们常常看到发行 500 或者 1000 的艺术作品，大家如何看待这样的情况，是不是 PFP 的赛道会被艺术 NFT 切掉一部分市场？**\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n我觉得 PFP 和艺术越来越没有一个明确的界限，比如说我自己是艺术家，做艺术 NFT 项目，但是我也会尝试把艺术性 PFP 项目做起来，也有很多 PFP 项目会偏向艺术性，所以两者应该在一个融合期。因为最近 PFP 项目多了之后，还是想有一些艺术性的回归，因为确实市场就是 PFP 项目太多了，但是怎么在这些项目里面给一个故事性，都是一个营销手段。\n\n一级市场我看到越来越多艺术项目得到社区和平台的支持，以我的个人项目为例，OKX 前段时间也跟我们有活动，包括跟其他社区一起 AMA 等等，虽然有句话叫做熊市抱团，但是我觉得是大家再造一个好的生态，无论是对 PFP 还是艺术项目都处于包容性阶段。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**各位最近有没有看到 NFT 市场上一些新的玩法？可以结合具体项目举例。**\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n最近看到一个项目我其实挺喜欢的，背后的技术是一个台湾的 DAO 团队，它其实也是一个偏动画、偏艺术的项目，你持有 NFT 可以参与在网站做出投票，影响故事线的发展，投票的过程也是一个质押，现在已经发展到第三阶段，每一次都提前告诉你选择的时间，holder有一个期待性，他们也会有一些空投，空投的东西同样会出现在故事线，这是最近我还挺留意的项目，因为我自己会比较喜欢能够共同参与的项目。上个月我去 NFT NYC 现场，会发现做 Web3 跟用户之间真正有互动是很难做到的。\n\n另外一个就是想提一下我自己的项目，我们也是借鉴了挺多蓝筹项目，很多 Holder 还是有参与感和互动形式，接下来我们会尝试做更多衍生物，通过 NFT 质押的方式让 Holder 可以拥有实体，所以我个人也是挺期待的。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n关于新的玩法最近有两个还挺火的，一个是黑猫 MIMIC SHHANS ，还有一个是 Soulda。我发现大家还蛮喜欢拿来做头像的，这个势头和速度比之前的蓝筹还要快，可能是因为价格比较低，最开始只需要二三十美金，另外也因为黑猫社群听说有一起运营的情况，团结度还是蛮高的。所以我在想在 NFT 领域，市场运营的作用其实是很大程度上超过图片质量，早期的时候大家认为 Azuki 画风非常符合亚洲人审美，但是后来开始变得市场化运作，虽然图片质量没有那么好，但是大家都在用，比如说哥布林，在当时很熊的情况下引发了一个小火爆。所以当下很多项目确实可以关注市场运营，有没有一些推陈出新的玩法。\n\n关于 NFT 质押和流动性，现在也有很多团队在关注。比如说我拿一个猴子，我可以质押给平台，拿出 5-10w 的流动，这部分玩法也在推陈出新，包括 NFT 借贷、租赁，这个市场确实现在看还是日新月异的。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**对比其他类型 NFT，你怎么看待艺术 NFT 未来的发展趋势？**\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n我算是比较早进入 NFT 市场的藏家，我觉得市场总是有一个循环流动性，并不会总是偏向某一种 NFT 项目，可能正好就是最近一些特别大的艺术家进来的时候，也会鼓励一些中小艺术家去发项目。比如说 Outland 前段时间有方力钧，蔡国强，有这些前辈的借鉴，会有越来越多的艺术家愿意进入这个市场。\n\n艺术项目可能会是下一个投资的方向，因为艺术 NFT 会随着艺术家本身的增值而增值，比如说又多了一个 layer 的玩法，很多艺术项目也会提供类似 pass 的权益赋能，我自己也是这么做的。另外虽然是个人艺术项目，但是背后技术团队也是很可以的，最近我们有一个技术上突破，在智能合约盲盒抽取上面，现在邀请我的小伙伴介绍一下。\n\n**Chase-eth.eth**\n\n我是在 Chainlink Labs 做分析师，平时就是看一些项目的投资和孵化。跟 Popil 老师认识也是在一个投资的小会里面，聊着聊着就发现她这个 NFT 项目里面，我们是有很多技术支持可以帮他们做的，特别是在开盲盒这个角度。可能懂技术的知道，如果你是在链上生成随机数的话，很容易被矿工进行篡改，篡改之后影响这个社区的空投公平性，ChainLink 开发了一个 VR-F 的解决方案，主要是结合链上链下完整及时，达到一个链上产生可验证随机数的机制，来支持所有的空投和 GameFi 等需要达到公平性的功能。\n\nVR-F 之前也跟 BAYC 合作过，他们去空投都会用我们这一条技术，这个社区反响蛮好的，所以说在技术大家可以放心，这也算是我们给 Popil 老师项目的一个背书。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**近期一些热门 NFT 项目如 Soulda、Mimic 开始去中心化运作，强调社区自治。其实在 Azuki 创始人因为一篇推文引发公关危机、mfers 创始人高调隐退之后，这个趋势越来越明显，你是怎么看待这种转变的？**\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n社区固然是很必要，但是不是在项目发行之前必须存在，这也是我的一个疑问。因为你会发现我自己的项目很特别的一点是没有去做 Discord，我们有可能会在发行之后去做，因为我会在项目发行之前做好整个项目的布置和智能合约的运营上面，而不是把时间消耗在经营社区这边，因为很多项目在发行之前有社区文化在建立，这一点非常好，但同时也可能会消耗整个项目的趋势。我自己也在观察大大小小各种项目，有些可能太投入精力在经营社区，整个调性和周期就冷却了。\n\n所以我自己是觉得，首先项目你要有自己的特性，第二点是当项目拥有一定社群的时候再去回馈你的社区，或许也是一个模型的改变，因为我发现越来越多喜欢的项目，刚好有其他蓝筹同时发行，大家可能就不关注了，这一点是很可惜的。有时候社区非常强大，但是因为投入过多时间经营社区，把自己的发行计划拖慢的情况也会有，所以我觉得两者之前需要一个平衡。\n\n**Will Wang（BAI partner）**\n\n我买 Soulda 确实是因为它的艺术性，当时看到网站做得那么好看，所以纯粹是看到有新闻报道，看到产品觉得这个还是挺花心思的。但是我一开始也很疑惑，因为每个人都 mint 了属于自己性格的 NFT，那是否具备可交易性，如果买别人的 NFT 意义在哪里。后来发现有一些自己买下来的好像最后过去查，真的跟自己做的题目挺符合的，所以这个项目无论是在设计上还是在细节优化上做得特别好。但是如果真要把这个行业做得偏艺术性的话，其实很多艺术家是挑藏家的，但是社区之类的项目对挑藏家这件事是很难做到的，这就是很多项目不可持续的原因，因为你的核心藏家圈层不固定，导致受到市场行情的影响，大家显得非常浮躁。\n\n第二个维度是我们怎么看社区。社区的核心是前人栽树后人乘凉，是需要有人留下一些好东西的。但是现在很多社区只不过就是大家忙着去做一些小图片，或者是让其他人进入这个圈子，这个不叫社区，这是非常幼稚低劣的东西。很多好的东西是不需要社区的，甚至连迪士尼这样的公司是不需要社区的，是因为内容产生方式是不需要社区的。\n\n所以我们需要反过来想，有社区，内容产生是否可以跟社区联系起来，所以我觉得 soulda 有可能是开了这个先河，它的每个 NFT 都相当于是 Holder 产生的内容，这是一个很小的尝试，也算一个小小的进步。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\n之前的 NFT 也是社区驱动的，我觉得之所以现在的一些项目变成社区驱动，只不过是由之前西方出道、Discord 出道变成了在中国人、微信群出道的。至少对我来说是这样的，比如说当年去玩一些项目的时候，老外社区也是非常火的。在我个人看来，如果讨论的是 PFP 和艺术 NFT 的话，社区本身就是 NFT 的价值所在，所以必然是非常重要的。我们在挑项目的时候也是看它的社区和叙事，叙事就是 utility 的部分，绝大多数项目没有这个部分，所以就只剩下社区。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n从我的角度来看，社区自治是一个方式，并不一定代表好还是不好。对于 NFT 项目来说，核心还是要看内容产出其实是蛮重要的。我们看头部的 Yuga Labs 是一直在做事情的，他们很重视社区本身没有错，但是纯粹靠社区驱动，我觉得也不会有从最开始的 BAYC 到变异猿再到 Apecoin 再到猴子地，上周出来的 Otherside 短视频内测。\n\n其实如果有一个主创的正确导向的话，我觉得是能很好地带领大家往前走的作用，纯把这个交给社区，无论是 Azuki 还是 mfers NFT 地板价都出现了暴跌，反应出来的客观事实是大家对于这类事件的信心是下降的，所以引发很多人抛售，从这个角度讲，一个好的创始人不用那么大的权重，但是有一种精神上的带领，推动社区往前走，这个事情本身会更好一点。\n\n我自己判断有一个好的 founder 带领大家往前走，要优于纯粹的社区自治，社区自治更由于一个方向错误的 founder，所以社区自治更像是一个方式，不一定代表好和坏。包括我们看到比较头部的蓝筹项目，都是去中心化的免费发给大家，现在也有了一个相互收购过程。\n\nMIMIC SHHANS 黑猫早期的时候，我听说也有小批玩家，把市场运营路线规划好了，大家一起把社区炒起来，确实能够感觉到如果你买了，会有人给你点赞，然后 follow 你，就会越来越多的人开始加入这个社区，有更多认同感。所以我们看到的社区自治，可能不是纯粹的社区自治。\n\n**Kevin（Founder of BitKeep）**\n\n我觉得首先社区自治是所有 Crypto 的一个叙事，如果你违背这个叙事，说自己是一个公司运作，这样的事情在行业内是没有基础的。但是在实操过程中，我觉得社区自治是长期愿景而不是发行过程要通过它来完成。对于能够把社区自治这个东西讲好的所有 NFT 项目都有好感。在今天这么早期的阶段，必须要说社区自治是要经过时间检验的，BTC 还有一个核心开发小组的，我觉得很大的一个点是为了社区自治而自治，而是要承认它的叙事逻辑。\n\n我们不应该纠结，但是我依然觉得这是 Crypto 和传统世界最显著的标准，我们要为了社区自治，实现和传统世界所谓的同股同权的美好愿景去努力，而不是在成立的时候就要追求说我们所有人都是一样的，所有伟大的公司都是被强有力的核心团队推动的，或者说一个伟大的组织。如果做不到的项目，是不能称为一个 NFT  社区的。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n**目前有一些 DAO 都是需要持有特定的 token 才能加入的，像 NFT 项目往社区化运作转型的话，其实特别适合 DAO 这样的协作方式，你怎么看待 NFT 和 DAO 的结合？**\n\n**Will Wang（BAI partner）**\n\n我自己买过的是 CityDAO，也很有意思，虽然好像他们做的唯一的事情就是在那块土地上插了根旗子拍了点照片，但也算是做了一些使用，把 NFT 收益权和投票权分开，因为有的人只想享受土地转卖的收益，有的人想参与到治理，更愿意来热情贡献，社区也奖励这样的行为，这些都是不多的试验。DAO 本身我自己有很强的偏见，我认为所有强调以人为组织的 DAO 是逃不过一个所谓非政府非营利组织半兼职组织的这种激励困境，我认为这不是 DAO 的精神，我们这个行业更强调的是 code is law ，我相信有很多事情，把权利交给 code，让 code 来执行是更有意思。所以我更喜欢协议驱动的 DAO，如果这种 DAO 需要 NFT 作为门槛的话，我也挺好奇会需要用到什么，很多时候可能就是因为你作为一个早期提供者，认可产品的理念去资助或者赞助，提升了很多 NFO、NPO 的效率，但是我一直不太认同 DAO 会颠覆公司制。\n\n**Popil（Artist）**\n\n我最近发现 DAO 的形式在发生改变，我自己也在很多的 DAO，我发现其实我挺享受在 DAO 里面的交互过程，在一些社区里面自己在做项目的人，希望得到更多的认同和社交目的，我会在 DAO 里面遇到特别有意思的人，DAO 给了很多在从事 Web3 行业的朋友一个好的社区环境\n\n其实我最早是在 Pizza DAO，之前一年大家很喜欢支持他们做 Pizza 项目。DAO 的玩法一直在变，像现在的 DAO 可能会做一些 pass，像台湾给我们做技术的 DAO 正在推行一些把 Web2 和 Web3 连在一起的玩法。类似这样各种各样的 DAO 是另一个不同的生态，我自己来说是比较喜欢、也想自己去做一个 DAO，组织这些有经验、在社区层面有影响力的人组成一个保护 Web3 从业者的 DAO，在里面提供一些工作资源和海外资源，因为我发现国内项目打入到海外的话会欠缺一些玩法，很多 DAO 也有这样的限制，他们有很好的核心成员和输出，但是在过程中会遇到一些困难。所以我会想组建一个 DAO 帮助大家。\n\n**Maxi（Head of OKX NFT）**\n\n我们在聊 DAO 的时候，首先整个行业没有一个关于什么是 DAO 的共识，很多 DAO 只不过是拉了一个 discord channel，这件事情我理解可能是老外不知道有微信可以建群这个东西？我觉得 discord 去验证你是否持有 NFT 和微信群组去验资，实际上是蛮像的。所以你都可以把它叫做 DAO。你的 DAO 在区块链建立，最后应该是用 code 去治理的，在这个系统里面 NFT 应该是代表你的身份、声誉或者准入凭证。现在 NFT 和 DAO 都在非常早期的阶段，未来肯定是有很多融合的部分，目前来说还是应该把自己该做的事情做好。\n\n**Sullivan（Investment Director at Zonff Partners）**\n\n我一直觉得 DAO 的魅力，相较于我们传统的公司制，你感兴趣你去看，看了之后你觉得有一个点可以参与进来，你很容易就可以参与到其中，然后跟着组织一起去做事情。现在 NFT 社区有一种玩法，你持有 NFT 才可以加入进来，它就是在进出口卡了一道。但是我自己没有想清楚这个事情究竟是好还是不好，从我的角度上讲，很多 DAO 成员最开始是对你感兴趣，同时又不需要花费太多成本，能加入进来一起做事情，我很自由地进，同时如果觉得方向有问题，DAO 理念不太合适，可以很自由地退出，甚至有的还有代币回报，但这是一个很好推进事情的模式。\n\n如果是 NFT 社区作为 DAO 的基础，我是有点存疑，很多感兴趣的人没办法加入进来，被挡在了门外。未来如果真的能走出来比较好的结合的话，也是存在这些可能性的 。\n\n\n---\n\n```\n                                 END                                                 \n\n

通过“分片”提高可扩展性——网络被分割成碎片，以创建更小、更快、更易于管理的部分。\n2. **The Verge** - 通过Verkle Trees优化存储。这将减少节点大小，并帮助以太坊变得更加可扩展。\n3. **The Purge** - 清除多余的历史数据。目标是减少验证节点所需的硬盘空间，并减少网络拥塞。\n4. **The Splurge** - 进行较小的更新，以确保在之前的更新后继续顺利运行。Vitalik称其为“有趣的东西”，因为所有艰苦的工作在这个阶段之前都完成了。\n\n“**到路线图结束时，以太坊将能够每秒处理10万笔交易**”。\n\n这是一个非常有吸引力的承诺，让我们拭目以待～\n\n## 🤨 提问——回答\n\n![](https://www.cliveshd.com/content/images/2022/07/image-8.png)\n\n### 问题：“Web3被广泛接受的最大障碍是什么？”\n\n大多数人会说“太复杂”或“必须更易于使用”或“没有足够的可扩展性”。\n\n但是我认为，答案是，**web3目前还没有为大部分人提供杀手级应用。**\n\n以早期互联网为例，Email可以说是当时的杀手级应用，人们使用Email大幅提高了沟通效率，推动了互联网的普及。\n\n‌‌\n\n反过来，想想为什么我要购买ETH？或者NFT如何使我的生活变得更好？\n\n人们购买5,000美元的NFT，并不是因为他们突然热爱艺术或热爱社区。当然有些人是这么想的，但这并不是为什么他们花大价钱购买它的原因。\n\n真正的原因很简单，因为他们想赚钱！\n\n‌‌\n\n如今，参与加密货币市场的玩家基本可以说都是是精通技术并且想赌博的书呆子。Web3目前的主要用例就是投机。\n\n但是，每件事情都有两面性。投机是有史以来最伟大的营销技巧。\n\n### 为什么投机十分有必要\n\n**金钱来自于共同的信念。**\n\n如果我用腰果支付理发师，他可能会把我暴打一顿。\n\n为什么？因为腰果不是钱。\n\n为什么腰果不是钱？是因为腰果的可用性不如纸币吗？\n\n腰果可是能吃的，而且非常美味！纸币并没有类似的用途。\n\n但是理发师不会接受腰果付款，因为他不相信自己能用这些腰果支付水费。‌‌\n\n钱就是信念。如果每个人都认为纸币或闪亮的金属是有价值的，那么它们就有。\n\n当然，不仅需要你相信。其他人都需要相信。越多人相信越好。\n\n**金钱是一种是网络效应。**\n\n电话是同样的例子。\n\n如果你是地球上唯一一个有电话的人。它就只是一个无用的盒子。\n\n如果有2个人，仍然很糟糕。你们只能互相打电话。\n\n但是，一旦整个城市都有电话，突然，它就变得非常有用。\n\n‌‌\n\n**加密货币也是同样的逻辑。**\n\n如果没有人拥有加密货币（或者一个人拥有所有）。没用。\n\n但是，一旦足够多的人相信它，拥有钱包和一些加密货币，它就会变得非常强大。\n\n‌‌\n\n**而投机是带我们达成共同信念的最快途径。**\n\n我可以跟我妈讲一种很酷的新数字分布式帐本技术，我打赌她会睡着。\n\n但是，如果我告诉她，我从某个加密货币上赚了很多钱……\n\n突然，她看着我，觉得有必要弄清楚我到底在搞些什么😄。\n\n‌‌\n\n**有效吗？**\n\n‌‌比特币没有营销团队。没有公关代理。没有广告预算，却设法创建了一个被数亿人认可的全球品牌。\n\n因此，投机是有史以来最好的营销活动之一。\n\n‌‌\n\n那么，回到最开始的问题，我认为web3由价格驱动的自我营销是非常有效的，让子弹飞一会儿，我们想要的答案（杀手级应用）一定会出现。\n\n## 🗞 NEWS\n\n* **Polyon、zkSync、Scroll 即将推出 zkEVM**。zkEVM（零知识证明以太坊虚拟机）是一种虚拟机，可以生成零知识证明来验证程序的正确性。（用一个形象的比喻就是，不需要知道你的年龄，就能判断你是否年满18岁。）它可以运行任何可以在以太坊上使用的智能合约或开发工具，并使用ZK证明来验证以太坊上的这些交易。 使用这一技术的Layer 2能够提供高吞吐量，低延迟和低手续费。\n* **俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京签署了一项法律，禁止在全国范围内进行数字支付**。该法律于7月8日获得被称为杜马的俄罗斯议会批准。禁止使用加密货币作为商品、服务和产品的支付手段。\n* \\*\\*Andreessen Horowitz（a16z）正在将其总部迁至云端。\\*\\*该公司将主要通过虚拟方式进行办公。它已将自己配置为能够非常快速地在世界任何地方进行物理组装的形态。除了现有的门洛公园和旧金山位置外，该公司还在迈阿密海滩、纽约和圣莫尼卡开设三个新办事处。它将继续在必要时在全球设立实体办事处，以支持其团队和合作伙伴。‌‌\n\n## ⏱ 珍惜每一分钟‌\n\n![](https://www.cliveshd.com/content/images/2022/07/TODAY.jpg)\n\n**本周，我想分享一本新书《Someday is Today》中的一段非常有启发性的摘录。**\n\n在过去的十几年里，我写了 11 本书，出版了 9 本书，因为我不会等待合适的时机来写作。我不会在珍贵、自命不凡和完美上浪费时间。\n\n确实，当我不教书的时候，我有更多的时间专门用于写作，但我不会等到七八月才开始工作。我整年都在写作。我在孩子们从楼梯上滚下来之前的凌晨写作。如果我没有要改正的论文或要计划的课程，我会在午餐时间写作。\n\n实际上，我是在周五午休时间写这句话的。我一边等意大利面的水沸腾一边写作。我在机械师换油时写作。我在一次未能按时开始的会议的前几分钟写作。\n\n这些是写作的理想时间吗？当然不是。但除非你有幸得到一位愿意支持你的赞助人，否则你需要抽出时间来写作。即使有赞助人，我仍然可能在我生命的这些裂缝中写作。我内心充满故事，并渴望与世界分享。为什么将我的创意流程限制在上午？每一分钟都很重要。\n\n问题是我们中的许多人低估了「分钟」的价值，而高估了一个小时、一天或一个周末的价值。我们会犹豫不决，就好像它们毫无用处一样，假设创造力只能以一个小时或一天或更长时间的增量发生。真是胡说八道。\n\n我们都等量分享的一种商品就是时间：每天 1,440 分钟——86,400 秒。\n\n我希望你停止以小时为单位思考一天的长度，而开始以分钟为单位思考。\n\n创作者们——企业家、艺术家、作家、音乐家、喜剧演员、雕塑家、家具工匠、陶艺家、编织者、园丁、视频游戏设计师、YouTube 创作者——必须更有效地利用这些时间，因为除非你有一个赞助人或信托基金，你可能需要在生活的许多其他需求中抽出时间来追求你的创造性激情。‌‌\n\n大多数有创造力的人在等待他们的热情得到回报时，都在坚持另一份工作（或两三份）。悲剧在于，有创造力的人（以及那些梦想有创造力的人）往往不如大多数人有效地利用他们的时间，而且往往他们一生都在等待正确的时刻，而不是利用现有的时间。\n\n我的诀窍是平等地珍惜一天中的每一分钟，不管它附加了多少其他分钟。一旦你选择了珍惜每一分钟，就可以开始创建属于自己的使用这些宝贵时间的系统。\n\n\n***\n\n**祝你新的一周生活愉快！**\n\nClive / 董双赫", "timestamp": 1658590917, "digest": "arw3fMYBrUs05mYg_ovG9eEPpSQPip2e9kO5OIX4RHE", "contributor": "0x47d9Dfd3A5fb88F5f19566B42b4bf6aDbCEFcDF7"}

{"id": "JSqOgIFhjiXbsesxr2YUo6JTbGX3hSRMEAIHhhhnNoE", "title": "普通人如何迈进Web3.0？", "body": "到底谁能说清楚Web3.0是什么？\n维基百科上是这样来定义的，Web3.0是关于全球资讯网发展的一个概念，主要基于区块链的去中心化、加密货币以及非同质化代币有关。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1qG35UzWUCLpQswqpqv9r.webp?height=130&width=1456)\n\n维基百科 - Web3.0\n\n开头雷击，这是啥？维基百科的定义非常敷衍，敷衍到说了等于没说的程度。于是网络上其实还有各路不同的讲解，因为至今没人能够给Web3.0一个权威、易懂且准确的定义，至少没有人能准确地划分出到底哪些东西应该归类为Web3.0。所以今天我们从一个Crypto原驻民的角度用最通俗但不求严谨的语言讲解我们认为的Web3.0是什么，以及如何从零进入Web3.0的世界。\n\nWeb1.0到3.0正在构建一个世界\nWeb1.0\n从互联网诞生开始，虚拟世界的梦就算是开始了，人们发现原来在现实世界以外还有另外一个窗口，可以看到不同的世界。下面我们会多次用到「窗口」这个词，我们把它比喻成互联网世界和现实世界的连接。\n\n在Web1.0这个时候的这个窗口非常小，而且是完全封闭的，我们只能通过这个小窗口看到里面投喂过来的信息。比如一个公司不必再为其他城市无法注意到它而苦恼，甚至买火车票去世界各地做展销。因为他们可以把自己放在互联网上，通过这个窗口让世界各地的人看到。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZZvs7nlYbpDgsTevmCjo1.webp?height=749&width=1456)\n\nWeb1.0 - 用户接收信息\nWeb2.0\n自从Youtube、Google、亚马逊等平台出现在这个窗口里以后，互联网迎来了第一个鼎盛时期：Web2.0，也就是我们这一代80、90后体会最深刻的一个时代。这个阶段互联网开始有了「人」的属性，也逐渐改变了人类的生活方式。从这个时候开始，人类可以通过这个窗口向对面投喂信息了，而不是像以前一样只能被动地接收。\n\n比如我们可以在Youtube、抖音等视频平台上传自己的视频，其他用户可以通过平台访问和观看我们上传的内容。 比如我们可以在亚马逊、淘宝等电商平台上出售商品，其他用户可以通过平台浏览和购买我们的线上商店。\n\n这些内容大多数还是由窗口左侧的企业和平台控制，他们理论上会以合法合规的原则来治理和维护这些信息，同时他们的权力还包括你的视频、商户等信息如何展示给其他人，起初在这点上的处理方式基本都很简单粗暴，首先基础数据就是这条信息的真实浏览量、时间等客观数据的排序，其次就是广告费，在保证节操的情况下谁给的钱多就把谁的排名靠前。不过发展到今天在这点的处理上越来越高级了，当你在刷淘宝或者短视频的时候，通常都会发现这些平台都会惊奇地给你推送你喜欢看的商品和节目，因为这个时候窗口的另外一边已经逐渐被训练成一个你的贴心小秘书，它好像是一个对你十分了解的的人，时刻在给你投喂你想要的东西。\n\n那么是谁能够把冰冷的网站和程序训练成一个“人”呢？\n\n大数据、人工智能、机器学习等一系列技术方法正在使互联网逐渐人格化。此时窗口对面的这个“人”通过不断积累和接收“我”的兴趣、知识、经验等信息，变成一个由企业和平台控制的我的私人一对一小秘书，不断告诉企业我需要什么，以便企业给我提供更好更精准的服务。\n\n此时Web2.0实现了窗口右侧的人类对左侧虚拟世界的探索，而虚拟世界则通过人类带过来的信息灌输给机器并不断训练和学习，目前人们普遍认为此时Web2.0已经发展到了极致，互联网的形态已经无限接近Web3.0时代。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wsggeJJO7gHFL_aXMMYv2.webp?height=726&width=1425)\n\nWeb2.0 - “用户交互信息”\nWeb3.0\n严格来说，Web3.0的概念提出是因为下一代的互联网将从技术底层至应用层均发生巨大变化和进步，已经超出了当前概念所能解释和涵盖的范围所产生的。所以此时我们再回到开头维基百科的定义：\n\nWeb3.0主要基于区块链的去中心化、加密货币以及非同质化代币有关。\n\n这一定义确实是简单且严谨的，因为目前能够给出的确定性概念只有相关的技术架构，应用层还没有完全开发出来，也就是说基于这些技术手段，人类到底能够创造出来什么样的应用，以及给社会文明带来什么样的价值尚未可知。\n\nSo… What !? 全剧终？\n\n… 当然不是，一项新技术的诞生势必是一场拓荒旅行，首先我们需要弄清楚\n\n“为什么需要Web3.0”\n\n“它有什么不同”\n\n“能给我们带来什么”\n\n弄清楚这三个问题，也许你也会坚定地踏上这趟旅行。因为Web3.0开始，「窗口」已经不再是界限，人类将穿过这窗口来控制另外一面的世界。\n\n为什么需要Web3.0？\n互联网的发展我们大致可以想象成一个人类的精神需求逐渐影响生活需求的过程，起初不管是网购、视频还是游戏，都只是人们生活中的一小部分，这个阶段人们的共识是“网络都是虚拟的”，大多数人还是用着纸钞、公用电话、习惯每逢周末去逛逛地下商场。但是进入Web2.0的尾声，互联网已经辐射到人们的大部分生活，辐射到什么程度呢？我们引用来自《Digital 2022 Global Overview Report》的数据：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1a_rZdnULBCCcbh4v2XL7.webp?height=819&width=1456)\n\nDigital 2022 Global Overview Report\n全球移动用户：超过三分之二 (67.1%) 的世界人口现在使用手机，到 2022 年初，独立用户将达到53.1 亿。\n\n全球互联网用户：到 2022 年初，全球互联网用户已攀升至49.5 亿，互联网普及率目前占世界总人口的 62.5%。\n\n同时在全球互联网用户这个范围内，每天在所有设备上使用互联网的时间接近 7 个小时。\n\n然而能够直观看到的现象就是实体商场店铺越来越少，电子支付已经基本取代纸币的流通，每天在公交车上地铁上或是茶余饭后，人们习惯拿出手机进入互联网世界冲浪。由此说明的问题就是互联网已经成为人类生活中的一项重要基础设施，所以说了这么多，我们想说明的问题核心就是，这张网的健康程度、丰富程度、可发展程度就极为重要。于是我们需要Web3.0做的事情就诞生了：\n\n这张网要足够健康，健康到不会因为单点故障导致过大冲击，也不会因为某个巨头的倒戈或腐败使网络世界有失公平，信息和权力真正掌握在每个用户手中。\n\n这张网要足够丰富，丰富到不单单创造一个懂你心意的虚拟小秘书，而是一个能够进一步满足人类精神、娱乐、生活等需求的虚拟世界空间。而这个概念今天已经有了，被称之为“Metaverse元宇宙”。\n\n这张网要具备开放的扩展能力，它靠所有用户进行开发和拓展，而非某几个运营商或是企业。\n\nWeb3.0有何不同\nWeb3.0在众多特点中最大的不同之处在于权力的分散和下放，也就是市场一直在说的“去中心化”，而去中心化的争议话题一直没有中断过，因为人们还是习惯了基于信任和权威构成的社会服务形态，比如人们不见得了解银行的风控制度以及资产情况，也很少有人每年去看银行自身的信息披露报告，人们之所以愿意把毕生积蓄存在银行的动机非常简单，就是基于对现存社会体系和规则的信任，其根本是对制定游戏规则的权威机构的依赖。\n\n这里需要强调的是，读到这里很多人可能认为Web3.0的倡导者是一群无政府主义者，其实不然，我们要知道随着网络和信息时代的飞速发展，作恶和违规的手段和途径将越来越多，很多情况是在既定的游戏规则下很难限制的，或者说我们无法保证个别的游戏规则制定者永远不腐败。\n\n熊猫人表情包，搞笑表情包_腾讯新闻\n… 大部分人可能听迷糊了，这里急需一个活生生的例子👇\n\n💡 举个非常贴近这两年热点话题的例子 — 元宇宙，很多人不理解元宇宙有什么好炒作的，不就是带个VR玩3D网游吗？我们先抛开元宇宙里其他身份、社交等内容，姑且把它当成一个Web3.0的游戏讲一下核心逻辑：\n\n首先我们都知道，现在大部分网游都存在游戏里的一个虚拟社会，既然叫做社会的话最核心的就是经济系统，在每个游戏中都有属于自己的游戏币，用来在这个虚拟社会中的消费。有钱你可以买到最顶尖的装备，拥有顶级的(虚拟)社会地位，这一切都跟现实社会的货币非常接近。理论上来说，如果我们在现实世界很有钱，应该能够买到虚拟世界的所有东西，实际上给我们的感觉也确实是这样的\n\n但是反过来，如果我们在游戏中赚了很多钱，往往无法带到现实世界中，原因就是我们可以通过游戏平台进行RMB充值来购买游戏中的货币或是装备道具等，但是我们无法再通过游戏平台把游戏中的货币提现变成RMB，核心逻辑就是现在其实很多游戏已经不管自己的游戏币叫货币了，而是元宝、钻石之类的，也是为了避免这个字眼上的理解偏差，就是目前Web2.0世界的游戏中所有的内容都是一种商品，你的充值是一种消费行为而非货币的兑换，也就不存在汇率。\n\n关键部分在这，之所以游戏中的货币不能定义成货币，也不能存在汇率与现实货币双向流通，背后的原因也比较好理解，因为一旦游戏中的货币可以与现实货币流通，那么意味着现实社会必须承认游戏世界中的行为是合规有效的，那么游戏中的经济体系就必须具备完整的规则框架，保证公平公正。这不是简单的工作，想象中游戏里如果也要设立一个中央银行来调控经济这是什么样的工作量。如果无法达到这个程度，那么一旦某游戏公司，或者某个程序员随意增发了一些游戏币，这就会对现实世界输出通胀，试问哪个政府能够允许这样的事情存在。\n\n那么这种事情在Web3.0的元宇宙中能够实现吗？答案是可能的，这套逻辑背后的关键点在于需要一个完整健全的规则来约束游戏世界，如果这套规则能够满足\n\n满足多数人的公平公正\n\n无法随意篡改\n\n具备市场调节能力\n\n那么就是可能实现的，简单说就是如何保证这套机制不会扰乱现实社会的经济系统，那么Web3.0的底层基础技术区块链和智能合约就可以完美解决上面上个问题。下面贴出了来自维基百科的定义（我先假设你们都能看懂，以后可以单独开一篇来讲）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3c_JJ0eWIuKW0JM3i-swI.webp?height=405&width=1456)\n\n维基百科 - 区块链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YRgBeyp9J17XYtGCJbHkF.webp?height=132&width=1456)\n\n维基百科 - 智能合约\n通俗的解释一遍，就是智能合约提供了这样一种制定好的规则协议，始终在区块链上运行，它不受某个人和机构团体的控制，也就是说我们可以把一个现实中相当成熟的方案转化成智能合约放在链上执行，事实证明现在很多区块链项目也是这样做的，由于区块链是由全世界各地的矿工或验证人维护的，同时是非常强的利益相关者，所以即使一旦出现危害大多人利益的问题，那么也会迫使所有区块链的矿工和验证人自发去纠正这个问题，以完成制度或是规则的演进和进化。这甚至比现实世界纠正错误的成本更低而且更高效。\n\n回到游戏这个话题，智能合约在这个场景里最大的优势就是每个执行环节都不需要人力来参与，执行程序即正义的原则，人只需要去关心规则的逻辑问题而不用担心人为的腐败问题。自然也不会有游戏公司私自增发游戏币的问题，因为本身就不存在这样的集权角色。那么理想中的元宇宙已经不单单是一个大型RPG游戏，而是一个真实的虚拟社会，这就是Web3.0带给我们最大的不同。\n\nWeb3.0具体能给我们带来什么？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qEFbCzej1KGNQPat0wZgL.webp?height=832&width=1456)\n\nWeb3.0 - “用户控制信息”\n首先我们需要统一一个观点：\n\n在可替代或重复性的工作上，机器比人类更加可靠。\n\n那么通过上面游戏的例子，我们可以得到的结论就是，Web3.0具备的能力是创造一个只需要制定好规则就可以脱离中心化（人、公司、机构团体）去独立运行的世界，同时又能够不断激励人去演进和进化这套规则。如果维持现实世界秩序的规则叫做法律，那么Web3.0世界的法律就是一条条不断演进的智能合约。\n\n所以Web3.0能给我们带来的东西就充满想象力，因为你可以创造任何现实世界中已经相当成熟的东西，链上充满了新大陆。比如去中心化金融(DeFi)，数字艺术品(NFT)，链上游戏(GameFi)等。\n\n我们来细数一下目前Web3.0已经诞生的应用领域：\n\n1 空间\n空间对于一个世界来说是容器，所有的应用、需求都将在容器中呈现，于是就有了各自的地盘，我们也可以想象成一个个的国家，这些国家可以是公链、Layer2、侧链甚至是私有链或联盟链。每条链由于其诞生的目的不同、技术底层不同、满足的需求不同，所以把它们看作是一个个国家还是比较贴切的，这些国家在不断靠自身的优势创建基础设施、基金会、应用生态来吸引用户和开发者。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D7H8PHSpchDC1W9JgqdMT.webp?height=968&width=1440)\n\n“区块链网络世界地图”\n2 金融\n金融产品可以说是第一个诞生在区块链上的需求，2009年1月3日，比特币的创始人中本聪在创世区块里留下一句永不可修改的经典之话：“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout forbanks.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SR2C-hTvvAOePNuD0VcQC.webp?height=876&width=1456)\n\nBitcoin创世区块\n在此之后区块链上的第一个代表性的应用 — 比特币，在长达10多年的时间内统治着区块链市场，这也是区块链一直被打上金融标签的原因，但从今日来看，区块链应用虽然大部分仍然是建立在Token经济学之上，但随着智能合约以及NFT等技术的出现，其本质上已经出现了突破。\n\n去中心化金融产品(DeFi)，在以太坊诞生以后的几年里开始发迹，它利用区块链的透明、可追溯、匿名等优势迅速得到了用户的支持，这里有一个网络上的经典例子：\n\n💡 当你把钱存进传统世界的银行，你会得到一张存单或者一纸合同。而后银行会将你的钱，可能还连同其他储户的钱以贷款的形式借给那些借款人，或者拿着这些钱再去投资、拆借。这个过程就像把你的1块钱放进了一个不透明的杯子里，然后把你所在这个杯子放进了无数个这种不透明的杯子群当中。最终你也许会拿回1块钱，但是你永远不知道你的1块钱在这群杯子里如何交换、流转。而DeFi解决的最直接问题就是把这些杯子都换成透明杯子。1块钱还是1块钱，银行的业务还是那套业务，但是你可以清楚地看到1块钱从哪里来到哪里去。\n\n3 物质\n如果说Token开启了区块链的大经济时代，那么NFT则预示着区块链的造物主时代就要来临。\n\n来自维基百科 - NFT\nNFT全称叫做非同质化代币，简单来说它代表了单个物质的唯一性。比如当你持有ETH时，你的1 ETH和其他人的1 ETH没有任何区别，这就是同质化的。那么非同质化代币就意味着唯一性，它非常符合理想世界的物质形态，比如我的一部iPhone 13，跟你的iPhone 13就是不一样的，即便它们的型号相同、样式相同，但是一部属于我的iPhone就已经被刻上了我的所属权标签。但是这种物质的非同质化特性不容易率先被挖掘，而艺术品由于其天生的稀有属性被第一个大范围应用到了NFT领域，单OpenSea交易平台日成交量就达2千万美金，最高峰值达单日成交4.7亿美金。\n\n如果数字艺术品领域只是给NFT开了个头，那么理论上未来人们可以通过NFT创造新世界中的任何物品。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MQ4iHf3FvdatTXKlCKv5P.webp?height=529&width=1456)\n\nOpenSea日交易量\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7BqmtGjViBaURlozfOC5P.webp?height=821&width=1456)\n\n\nOpenSea日交易量\n\n9个加密艺术品CryptoPunks拍卖逾1450万美金\n4 社交\n有了经济和物质以后，人们需要的就是“生活”了，作为新时代的主旋律，社交是人们生活中必不可少的一环。\n\n老一代人讲究通过察言观色识人是一种本事，这一点在新一代年轻人身上以及职场上仍然试用，但是在网络上我们通常无法做到这一点，那么Web3.0给出的答案更偏向于简单社交，基于区块链的透明以及可追溯性，你的所有链上活动将完全公开，所以当你的朋友点击你的虚拟形象，或是访问你的钱包地址，他就会知道你是一个什么样的人，随着链上生活的丰富化，你的人物画像也会越发饱满，比起面对面的交流，这种方式可能更加真实有效，朴实无华。你不需要用多么漂亮的语言介绍自己，别人也不需要考虑是否要相信，比如现在你在哪里参与过某个项目的发展和治理、钱包中有多少数字艺术品、你与人做了多少次交易，这些都可以想象成是你的经验值，通过区块链成为你的Web3.0身份的一部分，让其他人更好的了解你（更好地炫富）。\n\n当然这其中的问题也逐渐显露出来，你的财富可能由很多部分组成，比如金钱财富、项目经验、收藏品等等，那么很多人不愿意展示他们的金钱，亦或很多收藏家也不是想把自己所有的藏品都展示出来，所以这也催生出了另外一个需求— 隐私需求，就是让用户有选择公开与不公开的权利，但没有篡改的权力。它仍然可以保证公开出来的信息是真实且不可篡改的。有机会我们可以开专门一期来讲。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NEye1BdpyKSmm_HUfjs46.webp?height=779&width=1456)\n\n某区块链项目的链上解密活动\n5 娱乐\n如果说前面4点解决了虚拟世界中的基础需求，那么娱乐需求则是这块拼图的最后一部分。当人们已经不满足于枯燥的生活，游戏、音乐、创作就成为了主旋律，而链上的娱乐产品实际也将改善或解决一部分现实世界中存在的问题，比如\n\n游戏将不再是单向消费\n\n音乐专辑收入将大部分流向创作人\n\n艺术家可以在链上空间开办数字展览\n\n……\n\n这些都在等待这场拓荒旅行的同行者创造。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2uklQ_GS9HkAoysId3KkU.webp?height=468&width=1024)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658592540, "digest": "3MsDU0MR_m98XQsK1vgEru8PjCfsk1vpzabBUqNhe1Q", "contributor": "0x9C33357C831628b5De9e745bca84D29A76e415c7"}
{"id": "QHPfIaXbsMkyvQ0ukY0m5wHnNjKBVhdN9PIusmJpfZM", "title": "关于空投", "body": "关于空投，继续出来些小分享。除了给圈内朋友们一起建议和交流以外，也尝试简单梳理一下：什么是空投、为什么会有空投、空投的风险与机遇以及如何去撸空投？资深老韭菜可以直接划转到第五点如何去撸空投，有几个空投的准则框架或许对一些人而言有所帮助。\n\n### 一、什么是空投？\n\n在crypto/web3的世界中，大家对空投并不陌生。空投简而言之你可理解为撸羊毛，但此羊毛与互联网上的一些羊毛活动不在一个层次上，在我眼里一定程度上也是一次一级市场投资的范式转变。\n\n因为项目方空投给你的是他们项目或协议的代币(token)。那么代币（token）是一个什么概念呢，代币可以说是这个世纪的一大新发明，涵盖了多重属性，例如股权、治理、享受分红、证券的属性、货币的属性、商品的属性等等，许多项目根据自身情况赋予了代币不同的权益，总而言之，代币（token）可以捕获价值，并且在大多数区块链项目中起着举足轻重的地位。此外，代币通常会和股票类似一样在交易所上市，也就是我们所说的二级市场，为用户以及投资者提供了变现流动性并去挖掘更多的价值。基于此，项目方给我们空投的代币某种程度而言就有点类似给我们空投股票一样。（虽然比喻不恰当，但是便于你理解）\n\n### 二、web3项目为什么会发空投？\n\n为什么会发空投，换言之这个底层逻辑是什么呢？ 区块链项目通常情况下他们认为时机成熟或协议的硬性需求需要发行自己的代币，某种程度，这就有点类似于项目要上市。那么既然要上市，那么这个代币的总供给量、代币如何分配等信息是要公开的，而在代币的分配中，一般情况下而言，代币会分配给项目的早期投资人（风投vc）、创始团队、顾问基金会以及该项目中其他一些贡献者等等。而在贡献者当中，该项目早期的用户其实也是贡献者，因此许多项目在代币总量中往往会安排一部分的份额占比奖励给早期用户。例如dydx总量的7.5%空投奖励给早期用户，ENS代币总量的25%进行了空投。\n\nweb3/crypto是一场新的网络变革运动，但每一次变革在初期都很困难。因此，许多项目吸引用户过来体验等，也存在一定的难度。但如果项目有潜在的致富机会，那么就会激活人的积极性来参与，因此空投也成为了目前行业非常普遍的现象。就像经济学的十大定律之一那样，激励影响人的行为。而空投正是一种催化剂的手段来激励市场上的用户来参与这场创新变革运动。\n\n### 三、空投的机遇是什么？\n\n任何行业的发展在早期都存在一个巨大的红利期，改革开放初期胆子大去经商是一个红利期。早期的互联网大规模的发展时也是一个红利期。如今在区块链的世界中，web3/crypto也存在一个发展的红利期，而空投目前也是红利期中的一个支点。 空投给了我们许多意外的惊喜，甚至给了少部分人一些暴富的机会，没错，就是你想象中的暴富。\n\n例如现在的去中心化交易所uniswap，当初上市时他们也给了用户空投，不少用户也调侃空投时当初变现的钱可以购一部新的iphone，后来随着价格的上涨发现可以买一辆车。以太坊上的空投项目很多，例如捐赠平台gitcoin、衍生品交易所dydx、域名项目ens、二层解决方案optimism等等数不胜数，许多用户一个地址可以领取的价值奖励少则几千，多则数万上十万的空投奖励 。注意，这里仅仅只是一个地址领取空投的变现价值奖励。而数个地址账号符合空投要求的用户，则领取了他们更多的奖励，从而实现了少部分人的暴富梦。 \n\n### 四、空投的风险是什么？\n\n当然，暴富也并非那么简单。正是因为有不少案例给了不少人赚钱以及暴富的机会，导致行业越来越卷，更多人开始更加专业的撸空投，而且纯粹的属于那种羊毛党。这样一来，也就导致许多区块链项目方积累的并不是大量的真实用户，而是积累了少数用户在刷量进行操作。\n\n如此一来，许多项目方开始提高了空投的标准要求来过滤市场上的虚假地址用户。在行业中，项目方把这类用户归类为空投猎人。所谓的空投猎人，便是一个人为了获取更多的空投奖励，大量的注册更多的以太坊账号地址来体验交互某一个区块链项目。实际上，这批地址都是一个人，对于区块链的项目方而言，并没有积累更多的真实用户。如此一来，也就导致目前行业给用户的空投要要求标准在不断的提高，以至于你可能是一个真实的用户去体验交互了某项目，也被筛选出局没有领取空投代币的奖励资格。这也是行业内很多人所说的被反撸了，因此在交互埋伏某些项目的时候，也更加考验我们用户的精细化操作，避免被项目过滤而亏损了我们的交互成本。  \n \n\n### 五、那么如何来撸空投呢？\n\n在去年年中我就有分享过自己的一些法则，我自己的空投有个框架，核心梳理了四个小准则。\n\n准则一：信息过多，而人的精力有限，垃圾羊毛一概不要，质为主，量为辅 （准则一中，什么是垃圾羊毛呢。我认为的垃圾羊毛有几个特征：1、项目方本身格局就不大，更多的利益牢牢的捍卫在自己手中，而如何去判断项目方的格局呢？其实可以从官推以官方博客的介绍中可以窥窃一二的，例如他们的使命、愿景、价值观，看看他们是否有强烈的社区驱动的意愿。2、有些项目并不是发的实际意义上的空投，而是纯粹的类似web2当中的项目一样做一些小恩小惠的营销活动。） \n\n准则二：著名资本投资或知名社区参与过的项目，头部vc在我眼里是一个项目筛选过滤器。 （准则二中，著名资本参与过的项目，虽然说也有风投投资的项目有很多失败的，我们不必去把资本投资的每一个项目都奉为圭臬。但整体上而言，头部资本公开投资过的项目，往往存在更多更大的机遇。资本通常情况下，都需要做非常细化的行业研究工作，没有抽丝剥茧的分析能力，他们不大可能乱投资，资本往往更加理性、冷血、甚至对创业者团队的要求非常苛刻，团队没有一定的硬实力是打动不了投资人的，许多人低估了风投机构的力量，或许由于自己以前类fa的从业关系，于我而言，资本是一个非常不错的项目筛选过滤器。）\n\n准则三：确定性混沌，先确定项目赛道，而后赛道中看看都有哪些选手，这些选手分别处于赛道中的什么位置，挑选头部选手或有望成为头部的选手。\n\n（准则三中看赛道：项目成长的天花板非常有限，或者说赛道非常小，那么市场给该项目的估值就小，二级市场最终到用户手中代币的总价值自然也就小了这是非常简单的一个逻辑。为什么在准则一中许多项目方所谓的空投是垃圾羊毛呢，其实除了项目方格局不够的话，很多时候往往正是因为项目方他们处在一个小赛道上。赛道是先天的基因，就像一个人的天然禀性一样。如果赛道定位是工具类型的项目，估值都是非常有限的，例如跨链桥。可是如果你撸的项目是公链协议层，赛道空间大，资本早就用脚投票给出了高估值，例如最近宣传的沸沸扬扬的的aptos\\\\sui等新一代layer1的公链。）\n\n准则四：提前去预判空投的规则会是什么？将会分发给什么用户群体，需要完成哪些交互要素？交互的要素一定要罗列出来，并尽量满足所有的条件，如此才能够获取空投以及放大我们获取空投的权重。\n\n（准则四具体的交互要素：这个往往关乎着我们是否有资格领取空投以及领取空投的权重大小。众所周知，现在越来越卷，大家不仅看到了空投可以领取奖励，而且许多人亲身拿到过空投是尝过这个甜头的，也就导致这个圈子越来约卷，项目方的要求越来越高，对用户空投的要求也越来越高。那么基于此，我们唯一要做的就是提高自身分析判断，向内求，尽量去精细化的操作，如此才可能吃到大肉。例如，optimism，一个深度用户的空投是可以胜过好些数量的地址奖励。精细化的操作，一来防范我们被反撸，二来是进一步扩大我们的权重拿到更多的奖励。）\n\n最后：祝你们好运，希望帮到大家并进一步拓大这个圈子，某种程度而言也算是一个builder。我也是无偿做些分享，没有收取任何用户任何一分钱，不要抱怨，不要悲观、更不要去苛刻别人，毕竟你可是在白嫖，对吧，如果有收获或者发财了就点个赞。 \n ", "timestamp": 1658592492, "digest": "Ffo-5oQJWxnOU7DWNBMg6f2LzTIrDm5Rp_bVSO-y2X4", "contributor": "0x9866CCe07D8e794Ef7c0956e0940973C1518Ecb4"}

The DAO preceded all contributors.*\n\n**平等与灵活的底层逻辑源于其区别于传统创业团队的合成方式。**传统的创业团队是先找到背景互补能力相当的合伙人团队再去创业，DAO是先有想法然后有人被吸引来了，这就为所谓的“社区驱动”打下了基础。\n\n在 PartyDAO，虽然也会有一些团队负责具体的事情，但是在大的节点，比如合约确认、网页设计等，**社区成员的意愿想法会被充分征求。**\n\n一个简单的例子，PartyBid 最开始的设计稿是放在了一个公开的 Figma 文档里，在设计团队成员进行初步整理和思考后，PartyDAO 举行了一次线上设计会议，参会的成员一起贡献自己的观点，更好地补充并囊括了边缘用户案例，并完善了信息层的设计，这样的好处显而易见。\n\n在有关 DAO 的争议中，最常见的一个就是相较于传统公司，**去中心化团队的效率相对较低。**特别是对于 PartyDAO 来说，大家平常都有全职工作，还分布在不同地方，只能依靠线上沟通。\n\n这一点作为团队负责人的John Palmer也是有所感受：\n\n> *“我觉得协调一个这样的团队最大的挑战和教训就是事情可能会比计划走得慢一点。*\n>\n> *如果你按照这样的方式去工作，你需要理解人们都很忙，你需要考虑到事情可能会比你计划的晚一到两周的时间，有时候仅仅是因为大家都很忙。*\n>\n> *如果之后我再加入另一个DAO去推出一个产品的话，我会考虑在最一开始，就开始平行进行其他的诸如市场宣传之类的工作，而不是让大家都困在一个有着紧张时间线的工作里。*\n>\n> *毕竟最开始，大家加入是觉得这事儿很有趣，但当越来越多紧张的任务加入，这其实是违背了最开始的生产动力和乐趣的。”*\n\n**虽然有诸多限制，但是DAO的好处之一就是激励机制灵活。**PartyDAO 也采用了各种更加灵活的方式来调动大家的积极性：\n\n* 在2号提案里，John 就提出完全的去中心并不是很好的可以快速进行产品研发与迭代的方式，因此，PartyDAO 也有相关的权职机构用来跟进具体的任务的进展。相关人物的提名与确认都在之后的提案里得到了确认。\n* PartyDAO 的贡献者是按照 sprint-by-sprint 来工作的，每个 sprint 大概持续2-3个月。**相较于传统的长期的工作合同，这给了双方更灵活地选择工作量与报酬的调整机制。**例如在9号提案里就将提案通过后的两个月的工作任务进行分割确认，并根据工作量和市场情况确认用于支付报酬的预算。报酬将采用每两周支付的方式，具体数额根据两周实际完成的工作量而定。\n* **在 $PARTY 的分配机制上更加具体。**在10号提案里就提到，参与 V1 和 V1.2 产品研发的贡献者所能获得的代币池会和未来的贡献者隔离区分，在分配机制上避免冲突碰撞。而推出V1产品的团队所能分配到最终代币数量是由各团队针对每个个人的贡献确认。会在小团队层面首先确认，再由多签小组最终通过。\n* **PartyDAO 在10号提案里，宣布在 $PARTY 采用全新的代币机制。**确定了$PARTY不可通过挖矿获得，从而更好地防止通胀、投机，以保护来获得代币的贡献者。\n\n当然，也许是感受到纯兼职成员的组成，还是会在效率上成为进一步发展的阻碍，在 PartyBid V1 推出后十天左右，9号提案诞生。\n\n**自该提案开始，团队将使用更为稳定的 USDC 而不是 ETH 来支付报酬**，并表示这份提案的主要目的就是能尽快让团队成员可以全职建设 PartyBid 。\n\n年初，John 也在 Twitter 中宣布了自己已经在 PartyDAO 开始了全职工作，团队最新的招聘信息也是以全职为主。\n\n## ▌ 本质是社交产品\n\nPartyBid的产品逻辑很简单：\n\n* 选择加入或创建一个 Party\n* 质押一定数额的 ETH 参与 Party 发起的众筹\n* 若 NFT 为现买模式，当众筹金额达到现货 NFT 购买价格，即可在 PartyBit 支持的交易所下单；若为拍卖模式，在众筹金额达到最高竞拍后，则参与贡献的任何人都可选择“举牌”报价。若之后有其他人报了更高的价格，在竞拍期内，Party 可选择继续众筹再次报价\n* 如果竞拍/购买失败，众筹金额将返回，PartyBit 不收取任何费用\n* 如果竞拍/购买成功，未被使用的ETH会被返回，参与众筹的所有人都会获得代币确认所有权比例。参与者也会根据自己的出资比例获得相应的投票权，决定NFT的下一次底价\n\n**产品逻辑虽然简单，但是 PartyBid 的底层逻辑却不仅于此。**首要的原因就在于它抓住了一个既存在现有需求又有发展空间的的市场，大家集资参与到加密市场并不是一个新鲜事儿。\n\nPleasrDAO 就是其中一例——这个聚集了众多加密圈 OG 的神秘团体利用集资拍卖 NFT 的方式参与了不少慈善工作，并且在2021年12月就获得了 A16Z 的投资。\n\n但是 PleasrDAO 的缺点也显而易见——**它并没有将集资和拍卖的过程产品化，依旧是依靠着传统的社会声誉与社会交际网来进行整个行为。**\n\n而对普通人来说，一个蓝筹NFT的价格并不低，想参与但个人能力有限，哪怕幸运地聚集了一批朋友一起参与，但又很难在拍卖成交后确认所有权比例和后续持有等操作。所有这些，都是阻碍NFT走出加密圈的痛点，**也让NFT所创造的财富进一步地聚集到了本就拥有大量财富的人的手中。**\n\n在众筹结束的 Party 里，我们的确也看到了例如哥布林、Azuki、Doodles 的高价位NFT，但是神奇的是，高价位 NFT 并不是已创建的 Party 的大多数。\n\n我尝试用 Dune 抓取了一下相关数据，尽管由于 PartyDAO 相关的数据表格比较杂而混乱，我无法获得一个确认的数字。\n\n但是使用不同的表格计算都显示，**Party 志在购买的 NFT，至少半数以上的价格在0.5 ETH 以下。**\n\n诚然，这与NFT市场泡沫太大、投机项目太多以及FOMO情绪太浓的现状有关，但是也在很大程度上证明了 PartyBid 的使用场景，即绝非是停留在“通过众筹购买个人之前无力负担的NFT”这一层面。\n\n往大了说，虽然 PartyBid 看起来是一个 NFT 集资购买工具，但其本质是强调社交属性——**将单人模式转化成多人游戏模式。**\n\n按照负责市场的 Danny Aranda 的说法，PartyBid 可以扩展成为一种 DAO 或者聚集工具，“你还没有一个DAO，但你的脑海当中有一个很具体的想法，你可以用这个工具去实现它”。\n\n又或者“你只是想去跟你的朋友做一件什么事情，但希望采用一种更加经济可行却又有安全保障的方式”。这么听下来，PartyBid 瞄准的是整个“共享经济”市场？\n\n但“共享经济”好像也狭隘了一些，往更大了说，PartyBit 试图回答的是在 Web3 时代人们协作与社交方式的转变。\n\n合资买下一个NFT不是终点，而是在邀请你的朋友参与到集资或其他合作的过程中，你们一起创造了一个有趣的社交氛围，这才是其意义所在。\n\n## ▌ 产品力依旧是Web3时代的必备武器\n\n虽然Web3时代和Web2时代相比，在人力关系和组织架构上发生了翻天覆地的变化，但是在产品开发上需要**遵循的逻辑依旧不变。**\n\n**作为一款社交产品，用户数量永远都是一个重要指标。**那用户数量如何留存呢？答案很简单——产品好用。在这一点上，社区驱动的好处就显现出来了。前面提到，在线上设计会议里，参会者的各种想法能够让产品有效覆盖诸多可能被忽略的因素，这一点在 PartyBid 的产品细节里都得到了充分的体现。\n\nWeb3的诸多概念尚未被完全普及，若要让产品尽可能在非加密用户群里破圈，**在使用体验上就要求够小白。**PartyDAO 的产品设计也是在诸多细节上都力求降低参与门槛。\n\n一个最简单的例子就是，在 PartyBit 的钱包连接弹窗里，并没有默认用户已经拥有钱包，甚至没有默认用户知道什么是钱包，而是在常见的 Connect a Wallet 旁进行了简单的科普，并为用户转接到钱包注册网页。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qN8tcYYaVOC0gtBuOLlD-.png?height=1108&width=1572)\n\n而对于第一次参与众筹 NFT 的人来说，赢了拍卖后的第一个问题就是我该做什么。在点开获胜的Party页面时，在NFT图片的正上方就是 *What happens next?*  的保姆级教学视频。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lvaZlcZ9zcoCttVXrMnNF.png?height=1360&width=1152)\n\n**再比如，在创建 Party 时，PartyBid 也充分考虑到了用户的不同需求。**一部分人在意的是某个特定NFT，而另一部分人在意的只是某个特定系列。\n\n因此，在创建 Party 时，创建者可以自由选择是只购买某一特定NFT，还是购买这个系列的任意NFT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9bl2Hd9BnLI1zl5KtI6w7.png?height=530&width=982)\n\n**除了好用还要好玩，PartyBid 还允许用户自主为 Party 甚至是所有权代币取名。**\n\n考虑到有些创建者希望能将部分所有权，捐赠给慈善机构或者是其他DAO等组织，去年九月，产品也上线了 Party Split 的功能。\n\n当然，如果你希望和你的 Party peers 共享一些 crypto 方面的交叉点，你也可以要求捐赠者必须持有某一种 ERC-20 代币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OAZ5MKUUFLxr1qdYrQB8Z.png?height=566&width=972)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Emsm-EXzimkWdmgQ9M6Bq.png?height=1476&width=990)\n\n总体来说，PartyBid 在产品设计上力争做到了不把用户当天才，并在完善NFT购买体验的基础上，尽可能地为产品破圈打下基础。\n\n**但是，PartyBid仍有不少我个人觉得不够满意地方。**例如，在搜索浏览 Party时，可使用的过滤标准仅有 Party 状态和 NFT 交易平台两项，我无法针对NFT价格、购买资格等进行筛选。\n\n再比如，在参与NFT拍卖时，无法设置个人愿意参与的最高拍卖价格，这可能会导致最终的成交价格超出了我的心理预期范围。\n\n而且产品本身也存在一些bug，比如我在active party 里看到了已经拍卖结束的 Party。\n\n## ▌ PartyBid 的表现究竟如何\n\n根据 PartyBid 的官网数据显示，**截至目前，已有27027名用户为3753个 Party 贡献了8157.41 ETH。**\n\n官方没有给出过具体的日活数据，不过根据Dune的数据显示，虽然NFT市场受到加密行业整体下行的影响，但是PartyBid上的每日新增 Party 数量却在进入七月后迎来上升。\n\n考虑到其前几个月的数据的确显得有些不尽如人意，这一波增长在一定程度上应该也是受到了 PartyDAO 融资消息的利好影响，让PartyDAO和旗下产品有所破圈。\n\n进入六月后，新增 Party 数量和市场上 NFT 的销量基本呈现出类似的波动。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ElW4sTZGlJ3DQnWAb1lLl.png?height=496&width=1964)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4TAiAI4rR9Z7pE6yP4S-J.png?height=806&width=1078)\n\n在日贡献用户和日贡献金额方面也有着类似的变化。黑色五月一度让日贡献人数从2000+降至100以下。\n\n在融资新闻发出后，日贡献人数开始有所回暖，但随着市场降温又开始在六月中下旬跌入谷底，有好几日的日贡献人数甚至不足30。\n\n**进入七月，当以太价格回暖后，日活数量和NFT交易市场情况基本波动一致。**七月中旬以来的两周，日贡献人数基本稳定在300-600区间，贡献金额从5 ETH到 60 ETH不等。\n\n考虑到日活人数总量依旧不大，贡献金额受巨鲸影响甚大，这种波动也就不难理解了。\n\n总体来说，平台与市场的波形契合在一定程度上也代表了已有市场对产品本身的接纳度。但正如前文所言，加密市场看似热闹，但到目前为止仍是小众市场，**PartyBid 还远未成为一个出圈产品。**\n\n## ▌ DAO的发展仍旧是巨头的狂欢吗？\n\n关于未来发展，可能是很多DAO都在思考的问题。虽然依靠着社区募资和线上收入，PartyDAO 也安然无恙地存活了很久，并成功推出了第一版产品。\n\n但是出于产品迭代速度和 DAO 运作持续期的需求，PartyDAO 还是于今年三月通过了13号提案，决定接受以 A16Z 为代表的投资机构的资金。\n\n这一轮融资，PartyDAO 按照每 $PARTY 2 USDC 的价格分割了 8.2% 的币权。\n\n有了大额投资者，就会对产出和团队有了更高的期待和要求。而随着 PartyBid 的火热，也注定会有一批竞争者开始涌现。\n\n**如何能够在充分利用社区驱动优势的基础上维持效率，又如何在快速迭代的压力下保护好社区精神**，作为项目负责人的 John 可能又有新的课题需要攻克了。\n\n今年六月，PartyDAO 发了一条有意思的推文：“我们正在申请 Y Combinator，但是只会在他们允许我们所有150名成员都去山景城的情况下。”\n\n更有意思的是，PartyDAO 最早众筹时的金主爸爸之一，有着 Web3 时代 Y Combinator 之称的 Seed Club成员在下面回复：“我们欢迎你们所有人加入我们的 Discord。”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_bNsdDM17wcCSyuy--De6.png?height=472&width=1198)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sdvGdu2ns1inIK9Bei2Dv.png?height=1188&width=1188)\n\n我们再退回到 PartyDAO 最开始的故事。虽然说产品最后的落地成型，带有很强烈的草根抱团意味，但是不得不承认，这样一个想法能快速落地，并在众筹阶段就得到众多大佬力挺的前提也是因为想法的来源是圈内 OG。\n\nPartyDAO 的融资新闻发出后，也有一些群内讨论认为 A16Z 投的是团队里的 OG 们。**加密时代的诸多草根狂欢的内核依旧是巨鲸驱动，这不得不说是个局限。**\n\n不论对于 Seed Club 还是 PartyDAO 来说，它们都是在试图进行一场加密试验。在这个新事物发展的过程里，也注定要跟诸多已有体系进行交叉、碰撞。\n\n**至少在当下，新旧并存的答案并不是你死我活的对抗，而是取长补短的自我完善和互相学习的边界扩张。**\n\n**参考文献：**\n\n1、Denis Nazarov，《This DAO is here to

The DAO preceded all contributors.*\n\n**平等与灵活的底层逻辑源于其区别于传统创业团队的合成方式。**传统的创业团队是先找到背景互补能力相当的合伙人团队再去创业，DAO是先有想法然后有人被吸引来了，这就为所谓的“社区驱动”打下了基础。\n\n在 PartyDAO，虽然也会有一些团队负责具体的事情，但是在大的节点，比如合约确认、网页设计等，**社区成员的意愿想法会被充分征求。**\n\n一个简单的例子，PartyBid 最开始的设计稿是放在了一个公开的 Figma 文档里，在设计团队成员进行初步整理和思考后，PartyDAO 举行了一次线上设计会议，参会的成员一起贡献自己的观点，更好地补充并囊括了边缘用户案例，并完善了信息层的设计，这样的好处显而易见。\n\n在有关 DAO 的争议中，最常见的一个就是相较于传统公司，**去中心化团队的效率相对较低。**特别是对于 PartyDAO 来说，大家平常都有全职工作，还分布在不同地方，只能依靠线上沟通。\n\n这一点作为团队负责人的John Palmer也是有所感受：\n\n> *“我觉得协调一个这样的团队最大的挑战和教训就是事情可能会比计划走得慢一点。*\n>\n> *如果你按照这样的方式去工作，你需要理解人们都很忙，你需要考虑到事情可能会比你计划的晚一到两周的时间，有时候仅仅是因为大家都很忙。*\n>\n> *如果之后我再加入另一个DAO去推出一个产品的话，我会考虑在最一开始，就开始平行进行其他的诸如市场宣传之类的工作，而不是让大家都困在一个有着紧张时间线的工作里。*\n>\n> *毕竟最开始，大家加入是觉得这事儿很有趣，但当越来越多紧张的任务加入，这其实是违背了最开始的生产动力和乐趣的。”*\n\n**虽然有诸多限制，但是DAO的好处之一就是激励机制灵活。**PartyDAO 也采用了各种更加灵活的方式来调动大家的积极性：\n\n* 在2号提案里，John 就提出完全的去中心并不是很好的可以快速进行产品研发与迭代的方式，因此，PartyDAO 也有相关的权职机构用来跟进具体的任务的进展。相关人物的提名与确认都在之后的提案里得到了确认。\n* PartyDAO 的贡献者是按照 sprint-by-sprint 来工作的，每个 sprint 大概持续2-3个月。**相较于传统的长期的工作合同，这给了双方更灵活地选择工作量与报酬的调整机制。**例如在9号提案里就将提案通过后的两个月的工作任务进行分割确认，并根据工作量和市场情况确认用于支付报酬的预算。报酬将采用每两周支付的方式，具体数额根据两周实际完成的工作量而定。\n* **在 $PARTY 的分配机制上更加具体。**在10号提案里就提到，参与 V1 和 V1.2

采用全新的代币机制。**确定了$PARTY不可通过挖矿获得，从而更好地防止通胀、投机，以保护来获得代币的贡献者。\n\n当然，也许是感受到纯兼职成员的组成，还是会在效率上成为进一步发展的阻碍，在 PartyBid V1 推出后十天左右，9号提案诞生。\n\n**自该提案开始，团队将使用更为稳定的 USDC 而不是 ETH 来支付报酬**，并表示这份提案的主要目的就是能尽快让团队成员可以全职建设

的销量基本呈现出类似的波动。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ElW4sTZGlJ3DQnWAb1lLl.png?height=496&width=1964)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4TAiAI4rR9Z7pE6yP4S-J.png?height=806&width=1078)\n\n在日贡献用户和日贡献金额方面也有着类似的变化。黑色五月一度让日贡献人数从2000+降至100以下。\n\n在融资新闻发出后，日贡献人数开始有所回暖，但随着市场降温又开始在六月中下旬跌入谷底，有好几日的日贡献人数甚至不足30。\n\n**进入七月，当以太价格回暖后，日活数量和NFT交易市场情况基本波动一致。**七月中旬以来的两周，日贡献人数基本稳定在300-600区间，贡献金额从5 ETH到 60 ETH不等。\n\n考虑到日活人数总量依旧不大，贡献金额受巨鲸影响甚大，这种波动也就不难理解了。\n\n总体来说，平台与市场的波形契合在一定程度上也代表了已有市场对产品本身的接纳度。但正如前文所言，加密市场看似热闹，但到目前为止仍是小众市场，**PartyBid 还远未成为一个出圈产品。**\n\n## ▌ DAO的发展仍旧是巨头的狂欢吗？\n\n关于未来发展，可能是很多DAO都在思考的问题。虽然依靠着社区募资和线上收入，PartyDAO 也安然无恙地存活了很久，并成功推出了第一版产品。\n\n但是出于产品迭代速度和 DAO 运作持续期的需求，PartyDAO 还是于今年三月通过了13号提案，决定接受以 A16Z 为代表的投资机构的资金。\n\n这一轮融资，PartyDAO 按照每 $PARTY 2 USDC 的价格分割了 8.2% 的币权。\n\n有了大额投资者，就会对产出和团队有了更高的期待和要求。而随着 PartyBid 的火热，也注定会有一批竞争者开始涌现。\n\n**如何能够在充分利用社区驱动优势的基础上维持效率，又如何在快速迭代的压力下保护好社区精神**，作为项目负责人的 John 可能又有新的课题需要攻克了。\n\n今年六月，PartyDAO 发了一条有意思的推文：“我们正在申请 Y Combinator，但是只会在他们允许我们所有150名成员都去山景城的情况下。”\n\n更有意思的是，PartyDAO 最早众筹时的金主爸爸之一，有着 Web3 时代 Y Combinator 之称的 Seed Club成员在下面回复：“我们欢迎你们所有人加入我们的 Discord。”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_bNsdDM17wcCSyuy--De6.png?height=472&width=1198)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sdvGdu2ns1inIK9Bei2Dv.png?height=1188&width=1188)\n\n我们再退回到 PartyDAO 最开始的故事。虽然说产品最后的落地成型，带有很强烈的草根抱团意味，但是不得不承认，这样一个想法能快速落地，并在众筹阶段就得到众多大佬力挺的前提也是因为想法的来源是圈内 OG。\n\nPartyDAO 的融资新闻发出后，也有一些群内讨论认为 A16Z 投的是团队里的 OG 们。**加密时代的诸多草根狂欢的内核依旧是巨鲸驱动，这不得不说是个局限。**\n\n不论对于 Seed Club 还是 PartyDAO 来说，它们都是在试图进行一场加密试验。在这个新事物发展的过程里，也注定要跟诸多已有体系进行交叉、碰撞。\n\n**至少在当下，新旧并存的答案并不是你死我活的对抗，而是取长补短的自我完善和互相学习的边界扩张。**\n\n**参考文献：**\n\n1、Denis Nazarov，《This DAO is here to

The DAO preceded all contributors.*\n\n**平等与灵活的底层逻辑源于其区别于传统创业团队的合成方式。**传统的创业团队是先找到背景互补能力相当的合伙人团队再去创业，DAO是先有想法然后有人被吸引来了，这就为所谓的“社区驱动”打下了基础。\n\n在 PartyDAO，虽然也会有一些团队负责具体的事情，但是在大的节点，比如合约确认、网页设计等，**社区成员的意愿想法会被充分征求。**\n\n一个简单的例子，PartyBid 最开始的设计稿是放在了一个公开的 Figma 文档里，在设计团队成员进行初步整理和思考后，PartyDAO 举行了一次线上设计会议，参会的成员一起贡献自己的观点，更好地补充并囊括了边缘用户案例，并完善了信息层的设计，这样的好处显而易见。\n\n在有关 DAO 的争议中，最常见的一个就是相较于传统公司，**去中心化团队的效率相对较低。**特别是对于 PartyDAO 来说，大家平常都有全职工作，还分布在不同地方，只能依靠线上沟通。\n\n这一点作为团队负责人的John Palmer也是有所感受：\n\n> *“我觉得协调一个这样的团队最大的挑战和教训就是事情可能会比计划走得慢一点。*\n>\n> *如果你按照这样的方式去工作，你需要理解人们都很忙，你需要考虑到事情可能会比你计划的晚一到两周的时间，有时候仅仅是因为大家都很忙。*\n>\n> *如果之后我再加入另一个DAO去推出一个产品的话，我会考虑在最一开始，就开始平行进行其他的诸如市场宣传之类的工作，而不是让大家都困在一个有着紧张时间线的工作里。*\n>\n> *毕竟最开始，大家加入是觉得这事儿很有趣，但当越来越多紧张的任务加入，这其实是违背了最开始的生产动力和乐趣的。”*\n\n**虽然有诸多限制，但是DAO的好处之一就是激励机制灵活。**PartyDAO 也采用了各种更加灵活的方式来调动大家的积极性：\n\n* 在2号提案里，John 就提出完全的去中心并不是很好的可以快速进行产品研发与迭代的方式，因此，PartyDAO 也有相关的权职机构用来跟进具体的任务的进展。相关人物的提名与确认都在之后的提案里得到了确认。\n* PartyDAO 的贡献者是按照 sprint-by-sprint 来工作的，每个 sprint 大概持续2-3个月。**相较于传统的长期的工作合同，这给了双方更灵活地选择工作量与报酬的调整机制。**例如在9号提案里就将提案通过后的两个月的工作任务进行分割确认，并根据工作量和市场情况确认用于支付报酬的预算。报酬将采用每两周支付的方式，具体数额根据两周实际完成的工作量而定。\n* **在 $PARTY 的分配机制上更加具体。**在10号提案里就提到，参与 V1 和 V1.2 产品研发的贡献者所能获得的代币池会和未来的贡献者隔离区分，在分配机制上避免冲突碰撞。而推出V1产品的团队所能分配到最终代币数量是由各团队针对每个个人的贡献确认。会在小团队层面首先确认，再由多签小组最终通过。\n* **PartyDAO 在10号提案里，宣布在 $PARTY 采用全新的代币机制。**确定了$PARTY不可通过挖矿获得，从而更好地防止通胀、投机，以保护来获得代币的贡献者。\n\n当然，也许是感受到纯兼职成员的组成，还是会在效率上成为进一步发展的阻碍，在 PartyBid V1 推出后十天左右，9号提案诞生。\n\n**自该提案开始，团队将使用更为稳定的 USDC 而不是 ETH 来支付报酬**，并表示这份提案的主要目的就是能尽快让团队成员可以全职建设 PartyBid 。\n\n年初，John 也在 Twitter 中宣布了自己已经在 PartyDAO 开始了全职工作，团队最新的招聘信息也是以全职为主。\n\n## ▌ 本质是社交产品\n\nPartyBid的产品逻辑很简单：\n\n* 选择加入或创建一个 Party\n* 质押一定数额的 ETH 参与 Party 发起的众筹\n* 若 NFT 为现买模式，当众筹金额达到现货 NFT 购买价格，即可在 PartyBit 支持的交易所下单；若为拍卖模式，在众筹金额达到最高竞拍后，则参与贡献的任何人都可选择“举牌”报价。若之后有其他人报了更高的价格，在竞拍期内，Party 可选择继续众筹再次报价\n* 如果竞拍/购买失败，众筹金额将返回，PartyBit 不收取任何费用\n* 如果竞拍/购买成功，未被使用的ETH会被返回，参与众筹的所有人都会获得代币确认所有权比例。参与者也会根据自己的出资比例获得相应的投票权，决定NFT的下一次底价\n\n**产品逻辑虽然简单，但是 PartyBid 的底层逻辑却不仅于此。**首要的原因就在于它抓住了一个既存在现有需求又有发展空间的的市场，大家集资参与到加密市场并不是一个新鲜事儿。\n\nPleasrDAO 就是其中一例——这个聚集了众多加密圈 OG 的神秘团体利用集资拍卖 NFT 的方式参与了不少慈善工作，并且在2021年12月就获得了 A16Z 的投资。\n\n但是 PleasrDAO 的缺点也显而易见——**它并没有将集资和拍卖的过程产品化，依旧是依靠着传统的社会声誉与社会交际网来进行整个行为。**\n\n而对普通人来说，一个蓝筹NFT的价格并不低，想参与但个人能力有限，哪怕幸运地聚集了一批朋友一起参与，但又很难在拍卖成交后确认所有权比例和后续持有等操作。所有这些，都是阻碍NFT走出加密圈的痛点，**也让NFT所创造的财富进一步地聚集到了本就拥有大量财富的人的手中。**\n\n在众筹结束的 Party 里，我们的确也看到了例如哥布林、Azuki、Doodles 的高价位NFT，但是神奇的是，高价位 NFT 并不是已创建的 Party 的大多数。\n\n我尝试用 Dune 抓取了一下相关数据，尽管由于 PartyDAO 相关的数据表格比较杂而混乱，我无法获得一个确认的数字。\n\n但是使用不同的表格计算都显示，**Party 志在购买的 NFT，至少半数以上的价格在0.5 ETH 以下。**\n\n诚然，这与NFT市场泡沫太大、投机项目太多以及FOMO情绪太浓的现状有关，但是也在很大程度上证明了 PartyBid 的使用场景，即绝非是停留在“通过众筹购买个人之前无力负担的NFT”这一层面。\n\n往大了说，虽然 PartyBid 看起来是一个 NFT 集资购买工具，但其本质是强调社交属性——**将单人模式转化成多人游戏模式。**\n\n按照负责市场的 Danny Aranda 的说法，PartyBid 可以扩展成为一种 DAO 或者聚集工具，“你还没有一个DAO，但你的脑海当中有一个很具体的想法，你可以用这个工具去实现它”。\n\n又或者“你只是想去跟你的朋友做一件什么事情，但希望采用一种更加经济可行却又有安全保障的方式”。这么听下来，PartyBid 瞄准的是整个“共享经济”市场？\n\n但“共享经济”好像也狭隘了一些，往更大了说，PartyBit 试图回答的是在 Web3 时代人们协作与社交方式的转变。\n\n合资买下一个NFT不是终点，而是在邀请你的朋友参与到集资或其他合作的过程中，你们一起创造了一个有趣的社交氛围，这才是其意义所在。\n\n## ▌ 产品力依旧是Web3时代的必备武器\n\n虽然Web3时代和Web2时代相比，在人力关系和组织架构上发生了翻天覆地的变化，但是在产品开发上需要**遵循的逻辑依旧不变。**\n\n**作为一款社交产品，用户数量永远都是一个重要指标。**那用户数量如何留存呢？答案很简单——产品好用。在这一点上，社区驱动的好处就显现出来了。前面提到，在线上设计会议里，参会者的各种想法能够让产品有效覆盖诸多可能被忽略的因素，这一点在 PartyBid 的产品细节里都得到了充分的体现。\n\nWeb3的诸多概念尚未被完全普及，若要让产品尽可能在非加密用户群里破圈，**在使用体验上就要求够小白。**PartyDAO 的产品设计也是在诸多细节上都力求降低参与门槛。\n\n一个最简单的例子就是，在 PartyBit 的钱包连接弹窗里，并没有默认用户已经拥有钱包，甚至没有默认用户知道什么是钱包，而是在常见的 Connect a Wallet 旁进行了简单的科普，并为用户转接到钱包注册网页。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qN8tcYYaVOC0gtBuOLlD-.png?height=1108&width=1572)\n\n而对于第一次参与众筹 NFT 的人来说，赢了拍卖后的第一个问题就是我该做什么。在点开获胜的Party页面时，在NFT图片的正上方就是 *What happens next?*  的保姆级教学视频。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lvaZlcZ9zcoCttVXrMnNF.png?height=1360&width=1152)\n\n**再比如，在创建 Party 时，PartyBid 也充分考虑到了用户的不同需求。**一部分人在意的是某个特定NFT，而另一部分人在意的只是某个特定系列。\n\n因此，在创建 Party 时，创建者可以自由选择是只购买某一特定NFT，还是购买这个系列的任意NFT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9bl2Hd9BnLI1zl5KtI6w7.png?height=530&width=982)\n\n**除了好用还要好玩，PartyBid 还允许用户自主为 Party 甚至是所有权代币取名。**\n\n考虑到有些创建者希望能将部分所有权，捐赠给慈善机构或者是其他DAO等组织，去年九月，产品也上线了 Party Split 的功能。\n\n当然，如果你希望和你的 Party peers 共享一些 crypto 方面的交叉点，你也可以要求捐赠者必须持有某一种 ERC-20 代币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OAZ5MKUUFLxr1qdYrQB8Z.png?height=566&width=972)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Emsm-EXzimkWdmgQ9M6Bq.png?height=1476&width=990)\n\n总体来说，PartyBid 在产品设计上力争做到了不把用户当天才，并在完善NFT购买体验的基础上，尽可能地为产品破圈打下基础。\n\n**但是，PartyBid仍有不少我个人觉得不够满意地方。**例如，在搜索浏览 Party时，可使用的过滤标准仅有 Party 状态和 NFT 交易平台两项，我无法针对NFT价格、购买资格等进行筛选。\n\n再比如，在参与NFT拍卖时，无法设置个人愿意参与的最高拍卖价格，这可能会导致最终的成交价格超出了我的心理预期范围。\n\n而且产品本身也存在一些bug，比如我在active party 里看到了已经拍卖结束的 Party。\n\n## ▌ PartyBid 的表现究竟如何\n\n根据 PartyBid 的官网数据显示，**截至目前，已有27027名用户为3753个 Party 贡献了8157.41 ETH。**\n\n官方没有给出过具体的日活数据，不过根据Dune的数据显示，虽然NFT市场受到加密行业整体下行的影响，但是PartyBid上的每日新增 Party 数量却在进入七月后迎来上升。\n\n考虑到其前几个月的数据的确显得有些不尽如人意，这一波增长在一定程度上应该也是受到了 PartyDAO

USDC 的价格分割了 8.2% 的币权。\n\n有了大额投资者，就会对产出和团队有了更高的期待和要求。而随着 PartyBid 的火热，也注定会有一批竞争者开始涌现。\n\n**如何能够在充分利用社区驱动优势的基础上维持效率，又如何在快速迭代的压力下保护好社区精神**，作为项目负责人的 John 可能又有新的课题需要攻克了。\n\n今年六月，PartyDAO 发了一条有意思的推文：“我们正在申请 Y Combinator，但是只会在他们允许我们所有150名成员都去山景城的情况下。”\n\n更有意思的是，PartyDAO 最早众筹时的金主爸爸之一，有着 Web3 时代 Y Combinator 之称的 Seed Club成员在下面回复：“我们欢迎你们所有人加入我们的 Discord。”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_bNsdDM17wcCSyuy--De6.png?height=472&width=1198)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sdvGdu2ns1inIK9Bei2Dv.png?height=1188&width=1188)\n\n我们再退回到 PartyDAO 最开始的故事。虽然说产品最后的落地成型，带有很强烈的草根抱团意味，但是不得不承认，这样一个想法能快速落地，并在众筹阶段就得到众多大佬力挺的前提也是因为想法的来源是圈内 OG。\n\nPartyDAO 的融资新闻发出后，也有一些群内讨论认为 A16Z 投的是团队里的 OG 们。**加密时代的诸多草根狂欢的内核依旧是巨鲸驱动，这不得不说是个局限。**\n\n不论对于 Seed Club 还是 PartyDAO 来说，它们都是在试图进行一场加密试验。在这个新事物发展的过程里，也注定要跟诸多已有体系进行交叉、碰撞。\n\n**至少在当下，新旧并存的答案并不是你死我活的对抗，而是取长补短的自我完善和互相学习的边界扩张。**\n\n**参考文献：**\n\n1、Denis Nazarov，《This DAO is here to

The DAO preceded all contributors.*\n\n**平等与灵活的底层逻辑源于其区别于传统创业团队的合成方式。**传统的创业团队是先找到背景互补能力相当的合伙人团队再去创业，DAO是先有想法然后有人被吸引来了，这就为所谓的“社区驱动”打下了基础。\n\n在 PartyDAO，虽然也会有一些团队负责具体的事情，但是在大的节点，比如合约确认、网页设计等，**社区成员的意愿想法会被充分征求。**\n\n一个简单的例子，PartyBid 最开始的设计稿是放在了一个公开的 Figma 文档里，在设计团队成员进行初步整理和思考后，PartyDAO 举行了一次线上设计会议，参会的成员一起贡献自己的观点，更好地补充并囊括了边缘用户案例，并完善了信息层的设计，这样的好处显而易见。\n\n在有关 DAO 的争议中，最常见的一个就是相较于传统公司，**去中心化团队的效率相对较低。**特别是对于 PartyDAO 来说，大家平常都有全职工作，还分布在不同地方，只能依靠线上沟通。\n\n这一点作为团队负责人的John Palmer也是有所感受：\n\n> *“我觉得协调一个这样的团队最大的挑战和教训就是事情可能会比计划走得慢一点。*\n>\n> *如果你按照这样的方式去工作，你需要理解人们都很忙，你需要考虑到事情可能会比你计划的晚一到两周的时间，有时候仅仅是因为大家都很忙。*\n>\n> *如果之后我再加入另一个DAO去推出一个产品的话，我会考虑在最一开始，就开始平行进行其他的诸如市场宣传之类的工作，而不是让大家都困在一个有着紧张时间线的工作里。*\n>\n> *毕竟最开始，大家加入是觉得这事儿很有趣，但当越来越多紧张的任务加入，这其实是违背了最开始的生产动力和乐趣的。”*\n\n**虽然有诸多限制，但是DAO的好处之一就是激励机制灵活。**PartyDAO 也采用了各种更加灵活的方式来调动大家的积极性：\n\n* 在2号提案里，John 就提出完全的去中心并不是很好的可以快速进行产品研发与迭代的方式，因此，PartyDAO 也有相关的权职机构用来跟进具体的任务的进展。相关人物的提名与确认都在之后的提案里得到了确认。\n* PartyDAO 的贡献者是按照 sprint-by-sprint 来工作的，每个 sprint 大概持续2-3个月。**相较于传统的长期的工作合同，这给了双方更灵活地选择工作量与报酬的调整机制。**例如在9号提案里就将提案通过后的两个月的工作任务进行分割确认，并根据工作量和市场情况确认用于支付报酬的预算。报酬将采用每两周支付的方式，具体数额根据两周实际完成的工作量而定。\n* **在 $PARTY 的分配机制上更加具体。**在10号提案里就提到，参与 V1 和 V1.2 产品研发的贡献者所能获得的代币池会和未来的贡献者隔离区分，在分配机制上避免冲突碰撞。而推出V1产品的团队所能分配到最终代币数量是由各团队针对每个个人的贡献确认。会在小团队层面首先确认，再由多签小组最终通过。\n* **PartyDAO 在10号提案里，宣布在 $PARTY 采用全新的代币机制。**确定了$PARTY不可通过挖矿获得，从而更好地防止通胀、投机，以保护来获得代币的贡献者。\n\n当然，也许是感受到纯兼职成员的组成，还是会在效率上成为进一步发展的阻碍，在 PartyBid V1 推出后十天左右，9号提案诞生。\n\n**自该提案开始，团队将使用更为稳定的 USDC 而不是 ETH 来支付报酬**，并表示这份提案的主要目的就是能尽快让团队成员可以全职建设 PartyBid 。\n\n年初，John 也在 Twitter 中宣布了自己已经在 PartyDAO 开始了全职工作，团队最新的招聘信息也是以全职为主。\n\n## ▌ 本质是社交产品\n\nPartyBid的产品逻辑很简单：\n\n* 选择加入或创建一个 Party\n* 质押一定数额的 ETH 参与 Party 发起的众筹\n* 若 NFT 为现买模式，当众筹金额达到现货 NFT 购买价格，即可在 PartyBit 支持的交易所下单；若为拍卖模式，在众筹金额达到最高竞拍后，则参与贡献的任何人都可选择“举牌”报价。若之后有其他人报了更高的价格，在竞拍期内，Party 可选择继续众筹再次报价\n* 如果竞拍/购买失败，众筹金额将返回，PartyBit 不收取任何费用\n* 如果竞拍/购买成功，未被使用的ETH会被返回，参与众筹的所有人都会获得代币确认所有权比例。参与者也会根据自己的出资比例获得相应的投票权，决定NFT的下一次底价\n\n**产品逻辑虽然简单，但是 PartyBid 的底层逻辑却不仅于此。**首要的原因就在于它抓住了一个既存在现有需求又有发展空间的的市场，大家集资参与到加密市场并不是一个新鲜事儿。\n\nPleasrDAO 就是其中一例——这个聚集了众多加密圈 OG 的神秘团体利用集资拍卖 NFT 的方式参与了不少慈善工作，并且在2021年12月就获得了 A16Z 的投资。\n\n但是 PleasrDAO 的缺点也显而易见——**它并没有将集资和拍卖的过程产品化，依旧是依靠着传统的社会声誉与社会交际网来进行整个行为。**\n\n而对普通人来说，一个蓝筹NFT的价格并不低，想参与但个人能力有限，哪怕幸运地聚集了一批朋友一起参与，但又很难在拍卖成交后确认所有权比例和后续持有等操作。所有这些，都是阻碍NFT走出加密圈的痛点，**也让NFT所创造的财富进一步地聚集到了本就拥有大量财富的人的手中。**\n\n在众筹结束的 Party 里，我们的确也看到了例如哥布林、Azuki、Doodles 的高价位NFT，但是神奇的是，高价位 NFT 并不是已创建的 Party 的大多数。\n\n我尝试用 Dune 抓取了一下相关数据，尽管由于 PartyDAO 相关的数据表格比较杂而混乱，我无法获得一个确认的数字。\n\n但是使用不同的表格计算都显示，**Party 志在购买的 NFT，至少半数以上的价格在0.5 ETH 以下。**\n\n诚然，这与NFT市场泡沫太大、投机项目太多以及FOMO情绪太浓的现状有关，但是也在很大程度上证明了 PartyBid 的使用场景，即绝非是停留在“通过众筹购买个人之前无力负担的NFT”这一层面。\n\n往大了说，虽然 PartyBid 看起来是一个 NFT 集资购买工具，但其本质是强调社交属性——**将单人模式转化成多人游戏模式。**\n\n按照负责市场的 Danny Aranda 的说法，PartyBid 可以扩展成为一种 DAO 或者聚集工具，“你还没有一个DAO，但你的脑海当中有一个很具体的想法，你可以用这个工具去实现它”。\n\n又或者“你只是想去跟你的朋友做一件什么事情，但希望采用一种更加经济可行却又有安全保障的方式”。这么听下来，PartyBid 瞄准的是整个“共享经济”市场？\n\n但“共享经济”好像也狭隘了一些，往更大了说，PartyBit 试图回答的是在 Web3 时代人们协作与社交方式的转变。\n\n合资买下一个NFT不是终点，而是在邀请你的朋友参与到集资或其他合作的过程中，你们一起创造了一个有趣的社交氛围，这才是其意义所在。\n\n## ▌ 产品力依旧是Web3时代的必备武器\n\n虽然Web3时代和Web2时代相比，在人力关系和组织架构上发生了翻天覆地的变化，但是在产品开发上需要**遵循的逻辑依旧不变。**\n\n**作为一款社交产品，用户数量永远都是一个重要指标。**那用户数量如何留存呢？答案很简单——产品好用。在这一点上，社区驱动的好处就显现出来了。前面提到，在线上设计会议里，参会者的各种想法能够让产品有效覆盖诸多可能被忽略的因素，这一点在 PartyBid 的产品细节里都得到了充分的体现。\n\nWeb3的诸多概念尚未被完全普及，若要让产品尽可能在非加密用户群里破圈，**在使用体验上就要求够小白。**PartyDAO 的产品设计也是在诸多细节上都力求降低参与门槛。\n\n一个最简单的例子就是，在 PartyBit 的钱包连接弹窗里，并没有默认用户已经拥有钱包，甚至没有默认用户知道什么是钱包，而是在常见的 Connect a Wallet 旁进行了简单的科普，并为用户转接到钱包注册网页。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qN8tcYYaVOC0gtBuOLlD-.png?height=1108&width=1572)\n\n而对于第一次参与众筹 NFT 的人来说，赢了拍卖后的第一个问题就是我该做什么。在点开获胜的Party页面时，在NFT图片的正上方就是 *What happens next?*  的保姆级教学视频。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lvaZlcZ9zcoCttVXrMnNF.png?height=1360&width=1152)\n\n**再比如，在创建 Party 时，PartyBid 也充分考虑到了用户的不同需求。**一部分人在意的是某个特定NFT，而另一部分人在意的只是某个特定系列。\n\n因此，在创建 Party 时，创建者可以自由选择是只购买某一特定NFT，还是购买这个系列的任意NFT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9bl2Hd9BnLI1zl5KtI6w7.png?height=530&width=982)\n\n**除了好用还要好玩，PartyBid 还允许用户自主为 Party 甚至是所有权代币取名。**\n\n考虑到有些创建者希望能将部分所有权，捐赠给慈善机构或者是其他DAO等组织，去年九月，产品也上线了 Party Split 的功能。\n\n当然，如果你希望和你的 Party peers 共享一些 crypto 方面的交叉点，你也可以要求捐赠者必须持有某一种 ERC-20 代币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OAZ5MKUUFLxr1qdYrQB8Z.png?height=566&width=972)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Emsm-EXzimkWdmgQ9M6Bq.png?height=1476&width=990)\n\n总体来说，PartyBid 在产品设计上力争做到了不把用户当天才，并在完善NFT购买体验的基础上，尽可能地为产品破圈打下基础。\n\n**但是，PartyBid仍有不少我个人觉得不够满意地方。**例如，在搜索浏览 Party时，可使用的过滤标准仅有 Party 状态和 NFT 交易平台两项，我无法针对NFT价格、购买资格等进行筛选。\n\n再比如，在参与NFT拍卖时，无法设置个人愿意参与的最高拍卖价格，这可能会导致最终的成交价格超出了我的心理预期范围。\n\n而且产品本身也存在一些bug，比如我在active party 里看到了已经拍卖结束的 Party。\n\n## ▌ PartyBid 的表现究竟如何\n\n根据 PartyBid 的官网数据显示，**截至目前，已有27027名用户为3753个 Party 贡献了8157.41 ETH。**\n\n官方没有给出过具体的日活数据，不过根据Dune的数据显示，虽然NFT市场受到加密行业整体下行的影响，但是PartyBid上的每日新增 Party 数量却在进入七月后迎来上升。\n\n考虑到其前几个月的数据的确显得有些不尽如人意，这一波增长在一定程度上应该也是受到了 PartyDAO 融资消息的利好影响，让PartyDAO和旗下产品有所破圈。\n\n进入六月后，新增 Party 数量和市场上 NFT 的销量基本呈现出类似的波动。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ElW4sTZGlJ3DQnWAb1lLl.png?height=496&width=1964)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4TAiAI4rR9Z7pE6yP4S-J.png?height=806&width=1078)\n\n在日贡献用户和日贡献金额方面也有着类似的变化。黑色五月一度让日贡献人数从2000+降至100以下。\n\n在融资新闻发出后，日贡献人数开始有所回暖，但随着市场降温又开始在六月中下旬跌入谷底，有好几日的日贡献人数甚至不足30。\n\n**进入七月，当以太价格回暖后，日活数量和NFT交易市场情况基本波动一致。**七月中旬以来的两周，日贡献人数基本稳定在300-600区间，贡献金额从5 ETH到 60 ETH不等。\n\n考虑到日活人数总量依旧不大，贡献金额受巨鲸影响甚大，这种波动也就不难理解了。\n\n总体来说，平台与市场的波形契合在一定程度上也代表了已有市场对产品本身的接纳度。但正如前文所言，加密市场看似热闹，但到目前为止仍是小众市场，**PartyBid 还远未成为一个出圈产品。**\n\n## ▌ DAO的发展仍旧是巨头的狂欢吗？\n\n关于未来发展，可能是很多DAO都在思考的问题。虽然依靠着社区募资和线上收入，PartyDAO 也安然无恙地存活了很久，并成功推出了第一版产品。\n\n但是出于产品迭代速度和 DAO 运作持续期的需求，PartyDAO 还是于今年三月通过了13号提案，决定接受以 A16Z 为代表的投资机构的资金。\n\n这一轮融资，PartyDAO 按照每 $PARTY 2 USDC 的价格分割了 8.2% 的币权。\n\n有了大额投资者，就会对产出和团队有了更高的期待和要求。而随着 PartyBid 的火热，也注定会有一批竞争者开始涌现。\n\n**如何能够在充分利用社区驱动优势的基础上维持效率，又如何在快速迭代的压力下保护好社区精神**，作为项目负责人的 John 可能又有新的课题需要攻克了。\n\n今年六月，PartyDAO 发了一条有意思的推文：“我们正在申请 Y Combinator，但是只会在他们允许我们所有150名成员都去山景城的情况下。”\n\n更有意思的是，PartyDAO 最早众筹时的金主爸爸之一，有着 Web3 时代 Y Combinator 之称的 Seed Club成员在下面回复：“我们欢迎你们所有人加入我们的 Discord。”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_bNsdDM17wcCSyuy--De6.png?height=472&width=1198)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sdvGdu2ns1inIK9Bei2Dv.png?height=1188&width=1188)\n\n我们再退回到 PartyDAO 最开始的故事。虽然说产品最后的落地成型，带有很强烈的草根抱团意味，但是不得不承认，这样一个想法能快速落地，并在众筹阶段就得到众多大佬力挺的前提也是因为想法的来源是圈内 OG。\n\nPartyDAO 的融资新闻发出后，也有一些群内讨论认为 A16Z 投的是团队里的 OG 们。**加密时代的诸多草根狂欢的内核依旧是巨鲸驱动，这不得不说是个局限。**\n\n不论对于 Seed Club 还是 PartyDAO 来说，它们都是在试图进行一场加密试验。在这个新事物发展的过程里，也注定要跟诸多已有体系进行交叉、碰撞。\n\n**至少在当下，新旧并存的答案并不是你死我活的对抗，而是取长补短的自我完善和互相学习的边界扩张。**\n\n**参考文献：**\n\n1、Denis Nazarov，《This DAO is here to

{"id": "yN9ib0ZftyimQpJoGeoKkshU9-v2Dy8pA1gTtn9IcfA", "title": "详解 Cosmos 的垂直扩展之路 ", "body": "## 总览\n\n我们已经多次介绍过 Cosmos, 和 Polkadot 类似，Cosmos 这种 Chain Agnostic Layer0 解决方案主要致力于解决其上搭建各种区块链的水平扩展问题， 相较于以太坊， Solana 这种垂直扩展解决方案，Cosmos 可以理解为由各个独立的 zone 组成的水平扩展框架， 而 Zone 可以理解为 Cosmos 框架中各种验证节点，安全假设，并且通过 IBC 进行通讯的主权区块链。\n\n当然相较于以太坊这种节点参与验证所有 issue 的单片链（验证者的容量紧张）而言，应用特定链的网络更具有可扩展性，那么具体怎么理解呢？如果 Zone 发生拥堵，或者区块空间满了，那么另一条区块链可以接入进来，实现水平化扩展。比如 Osmosis 上应用百花齐放，导致链的扩展性遇到了瓶颈，那么可以接入新的链进来，新的链可以有自己的验证节点，也可以以消费链的形式，借用 OSMO 现有节点安全性的方式接入。注意这里水平性扩展和 IBC 的理解，IBC 解决了链与链，Zone 与 Zone 间的通信问题，而不是水平性扩展。比如他们可以通过使用 Rollups， 这些 Rollups 通过 Zone 作为结算层，实现相互通信。\n\n如果一个 Zone 开始拥堵，那么他们也可以在执行层引入 Rollups， 并且使用 Celestia 作为数据可见层。如果某个区域开始过于拥挤，他们可以在执行层实施汇总，并让他们使用 Celestia 作为 DA 层。除了可扩展性，其设计框架和开发者友好的模块化框架也是其核心特色之一。开发者可以使用各种语言（Cosmos SDK 使用的 Go 语言开发，合约却是 Rust；Goland 作为 Cosmos SDK 的分叉，使用 Go 语言的智能合约), 目前主要语言包括 Rust, Golang, CosmWasm, JavaScript 和 Solidity 也即将接入。Cosmos SDK, Tendermint，IBC，CosmWasm 这些 Cosmos 的核心技术堆栈方便了开发者，让开发者可以专注于以应用为导向的特定区块链的开发。\n\n相较于以太坊的可组合性和可编程性，其强调了互操作性和主权性，应用链可以有更多灵活性和选择性定制其性能，运行等参数。同时相较于 POW 等概率性确认出块模型，TendermintBFT 为主导的确定性确认机制下，其抗 MEV 的设计也引入了交易排序机制（Tranasaction order mechainism, Osmosis 是这个机制的先行者），感兴趣的朋友可以看[加密经济的 MEV 博弈：Osmosis 的阈值加密技术 vs Flashbot 的 SGX?](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/EDGUr9jobnxfojLSXRM0oUPRtKcwHeiz0fLtqxqYiwM)。\n\n当然其设计的 trade off 也体现在以下问题，在跨链安全正式上线之前（Q3,2022), 目前所有 Zone 都独立负责其安全性，而以太坊上的应用都依赖于其安全性。而我们之前也提到过，一个网络的安全一定程度上取决于其质押代币维护其网络的价值，而当 TVL 大于这个价值时会给网络带来潜在风险，所以对于一些长尾/新的应用链来说，如何找到合适的安全验证节点，以及维持相对稳定的币价，显得尤为重要。\n\n因此，跨链安全，Osmosis 的超流体质押，以及 Celestia DA，共识以及共享安全都在试图解决这个问题，对这块感兴趣的可以看 [Cosmos 技术原理，设计框架以及生态全览](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/5TaG1uwM_DivhU-2BpY_DRENmx5mmhdMYgr_4IDMeDM)。同时，IBC 目前仅支持同构链的跨链通信，并且链内部可以支持同步交互，而对外，目前 IBC 也正在接入其他以 Polkadot, Near, EVM 等为代表的异构链，对内，IBC 上跨链账户模块的上线也将支持不同链间的同步交互（目前 Juno v8.00，Osmosis，Cosmos Hub 等为代表的链已经接入跨链账户模块）。\n\n所以尽管 Cosmos 的设计存在一些问题，但目前都已经有了不错的解决方案。既然水平化扩展得益于 Cosmos 天然的 “完美” 架构，我们本文将着重于其垂直扩展性的解决方案，其中包括 Celestia，跨链安全，Dymension 等，部分内容来源于我们与相关的团队的交流。\n\n## Celestia\n\nCelestia 是目前模块化区块链中最引入注意的项目，致力于解决数据可见性的问题，我们也认为其提出的解决方案（Celestia 是否会一统天下不好说, 但选择的方向是很有前景的）很有可能会成为以太坊和 Cosmos 生态中的中流砥柱。那么 Celesita 究竟解决了什么问题。\n\n我们认为有几个方向，1）扩展性，通过将数据可见层，共识层与执行层分离，通过数据可见采样的方法，让轻节点在无需执行交易的情况下可以确保生产者已经发布了全部的数据。这里要理解的是 Celestia 的轻节点不参与验证交易，而只是需要确保数据可见并且参与数据排序。所以相较于其他 L1 的链，Celestia 节点仅确保数据可见，并且通过 Tendermint 共识协议进行交易排序。而无需像其他 L1 一样参与交易的验证和执行。这个验证交给 Rollups 所依赖的结算层的验证节点，而执行则在 Rollups 的客户端执行。\n\n2）解决 Rollups centric 的扩容路线，目前最大的问题就是 calldata 上链太贵了，尽管目前以太坊的 L2 垂直化扩展解决方案将交易搬到链下，并且通过压缩数据和 calldata 的方式将数据发送至 L1（当然该压缩技术相较于直接发送至 L1，成本降低了不少），但是成本仍然很高，因此 Celestia 试图解决这个问题。举个例子来说，对于以太坊 Rollups 来说，他们可以选择将 Celestia 作为 DA 层。Celestia 会将这些处理证明（而非压缩数据本身，这些证明可以理解为比上传数据便宜的多的一篮子签名和默尔克根，）发送至以太坊，并且通过批量处理的方式优化燃料费用，所以这比 Rollups 将压缩数据直接上传以太坊要便宜的多，整个流程可以理解为以太坊 Rollup -> Celestia -> 以太坊主网。当然这个问题也在以太坊 2.0 中有相关的解决方案（EIP-4884), EIP-4844 引入了和调用数据不一样的一种交易格式，带有数据碎片的交易，从而进行存储。数据碎片可以承载 125KB 的数据，同时在和同等数据量的调用数据相比，便宜很多。这些数据碎片通常在一个月之后会被删除，从而降低了存储要求。而这一个月的时间足够让验证者去完成数据采样中的安全假设。具体可以看[以太坊扩容终极解决方案 - Danksharding（一）](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/3I9uBeEvPqMG9Cl8HBVvEh0-cNELLbObdegLDDjcpq8)，[以太坊扩容终极解决方案 - Danksharding 与 MEV 设计（二](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/S5KULzG3QJsk02J693wmw9HqDvQvz7lNP4VEFYF9nWA)）。\n\n3）多虚拟机部署的灵活性，和以太坊上的 Rollups 不同，Celestia 上的 Rollups 不一定专门为 EVM 兼容的欺诈证明/有效性证明实现。据我们所知，Celestia 已经和很多团队开展了合作（还未官宣）。这打开了 Celestia 可支持的虚拟机的设计空间，并且开放给更多的开发者。我们看到了 Starkware、LLVM、MoveVM、CosmWasm、FuelVM 等拥有可支持操作，数据库结构，交易格式，软件语言的自定义虚拟机，在处理特定应用场景的同时也能够实现最优的性能。针对于 FuelVM, 我们可以关注最近上线的 Fuelv1, Fuel 与今天的 ORus 的最大区别在于，它运行一个全新的 VM 架构，即 FuelVM 及其工具链和语言。FuelVM 具有 WASM、EVM 和 Solana 的 SeaLevel 的特征。FuelVM 最引人注目的潜在方面是它在基于 UTXO 的数据模型上执行。\n\n关于未来多 VM 的格局的想法我们也在 [CosmWasm：进化的虚拟机与智能合约](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/iHNGFwTAEDGAUuuK4UPtyBt4XNIDFWX94Q68XpHw2yg)一文中进行了描述。当然还有轻松部署，有效资源定价等优势，这里我们就不一一讨论了。\n\n![By Delphi Digital](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97UIM9Ih2PyiGmW7h2EWo.png?height=555&width=1080)\n\nCelestia 中最核心的设计是其数据可见采样 (DAS)，这也是欺诈证明/有效证明的前提。而 DAS 的关键在于抹除码技术，这意味着任何数据通过抹除码技术，可以实现数据大小的翻倍，并且可以通过扩展数据的任何一定百分比的数据，对原有数据进行恢复。通过这种方式，Celestia 上的轻节点可以以数据采样的方式，获取小块数据，并且基于较高的概率，保证数据的可见性。\n\n当然为了确保足够的数据样本，从而用于恢复数据，这个抽样过程应该保证参与节点的数量。DAS 的一个核心特点是当参与节点采集的数量越多，采集的数据越多，那么基于同样的概率假设下，更多的数据可以被验证。所以理论上，当参与的节点数量越多，区块的大小可以更大，支持更多 TPS，这个和单片链的设计不同，在单片链中，节点数量越多（全节点验证），为了确保去中心化的实现，区块大小/燃料限制的设置抑制状态的增长，从而降低了全节点的成本。\n\n当然这个设计的 trade off 问题就是尽管轻节点可以享有与全节点同等的安全性，但是其受限于 O(√n) 的带宽成本，其中 n 为区块大小。所以 Celestia 数据可见的吞吐量主要受限于以下两点：\n\n1. 可以集体采样的数据量\n2. 轻节点的目标块头大小\n\n目前 Celesita 上的节点类型包括两种：\n\n共识节点\n\n验证节点：参与共识。\n\n共识全节点：同步区块链历史的 Celestia-App 全节点。\n\n数据可用性节点\n\n桥节点：在数据可用性网络和共识网络之间桥接区块。\n\n全存储节点：存储所有数据但不连接共识。\n\n轻节点：轻客户端在数据可用性网络上进行数据可用性采样。\n\nOptimint 是允许链作为 Rollups 部署于 Celestia 的产品。这些链可以启动自己的 P2P 网络，将交易数据收集到区块中，并且将他们发布到 Celestia 主网，负责数据可见和共识。Optimint 本质上是一个供开发人员使用的框架，基于其搭建的链无需寻找安全的验证器，Celestia 会为他们处理工作。\n\nOptimint 可以理解为 Celestia 的共识层，它提供了一个交易排序框架，可用于数据可用性层和结算层（但是不参与交易的验证）。这个似乎和我们下文将介绍的 Cosmos Hub 即将上线的跨链安全的理念相似，而 Optiminent 是否会对跨链安全造成威胁，我们也将结合他们共识的差异性来判断。但尽管如此，我们认为 Celestia 的先进理念，以及其在 Cosmos 和以太坊生态中的重要性要等到上线后才能得知（2023 年）。对 Celestia 感兴趣的，可以看我们的 [Celestia 的模块化架构](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/fzB21y2BH7mIzVblrmnzsUrvk3fB3BhYDJO__Nb_Lgw)和 [Celestia 2 - 技术实践](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/q1ig8FgutU5HAOqfO0IkDxIzew8ZA2Fl0-eFVr2HRfs)。\n\n## 跨链安全\n\n跨链安全本质上可以理解为租借安全性，目前 V1 版本中仅支持 Cosmos Hub 的全部节点。当然对于模块本身，是一个可插拔，可选择的模块。对于选择接入的消费链而言，在 V1 版本中，消费链必须强制接入 175 个验证节点，并且需要治理通过, 本质上是一种带有准入机制的产品。消费链需要提交团队的核心产品，和理念，在确保足够的 Atom 持有者投票通过后，才可以接入。同时，消费链也需要支付一定的费用（% 通胀费用）给到验证者节点，这个比例也需要在治理提案中明确，同时在 V1 中，消费链将 75% 的燃料费给到国库 DAO，又多签钱包管理，而 25% 的燃料费给到 Hub, 激励验证节点和质押者。\n\n在我们之前的文章中也提到过，团队可以选择创建（体现了灵活性和可选择性）“自定义消费链” 或 “合约消费者链（通过 CosmWasm 实现）”。两者之间的主要区别在于验证节点运行的二进制文件。合约消费者链中的二进制文件是标准的，而自定义消费链中，团队可以灵活地自定义二进制文件以适应不同的交易费用和交易组装。ICS 总共会有三个版本，第一个版本是消费链的安全完全由 Cosmos Hub 节点维护。而这些消费链是否能够接入需要 Cosmos Hub 通过治理根据他们的风险概况最终决定（比如是一条基于 Cosmwasm 开发的消费合约链还是一条 SDK 无变化的消费自定义链）。\n\n因此，Atom 质押者需要决定他们质押的验证节点，因为在享受额外收益的同时，也会面临和其他 POS 链一样消费链节点宕机和不当行为风险。第一个版本中，消费链和 Cosmos Hub 享有了共同的安全保证。但这种情况下的参与 ICS 的节点所质押的 Atom 价值和这些节点会面临的 Slashing 风险。同时，对于验证节点来说，需要额外的硬件要求，从而保证工作量。而第二个版本中，消费链可以将自己的质押代币与 Cosmos Hub 的 Atom 代币相结合，并最终确定消费链的验证器集组成。而 V3 版本中，这种关系会进一步扩大和加深，可以在双向大型网络间实现横向共享安全协议，Cosmos Hub 可以和任何其他 Cosmos SDK 项目的验证集共享 Atom 价值，反之亦然，可以将其理解为主权网络的相互安全保险。而在 V3 版本中，Hub 验证节点可以有权停止验证哪条链。第二，三个版本相较于第一个版本，网络安全将最终取决于消费链和供应链共同的安全。\n\n而对于 Cosmos Hub 的部分参与的节点来说，如果消费链上的唯一验证节点恶意进行攻击，会有女巫攻击的可能性。目前可以关注的项目包括 Quicksilver 和 Neutron(P2P，一个大节点搭建的自定义合约链）。对于跨链安全想要进一步了解的，可以看深度分析 Cosmos 的开拓者 -

Danksharding（一）](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/3I9uBeEvPqMG9Cl8HBVvEh0-cNELLbObdegLDDjcpq8)，[以太坊扩容终极解决方案 - Danksharding 与 MEV 设计（二](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/S5KULzG3QJsk02J693wmw9HqDvQvz7lNP4VEFYF9nWA)）。\n\n3）多虚拟机部署的灵活性，和以太坊上的 Rollups 不同，Celestia 上的 Rollups 不一定专门为 EVM 兼容的欺诈证明/有效性证明实现。据我们所知，Celestia 已经和很多团队开展了合作（还未官宣）。这打开了 Celestia 可支持的虚拟机的设计空间，并且开放给更多的开发者。我们看到了 Starkware、LLVM、MoveVM、CosmWasm、FuelVM 等拥有可支持操作，数据库结构，交易格式，软件语言的自定义虚拟机，在处理特定应用场景的同时也能够实现最优的性能。针对于 FuelVM, 我们可以关注最近上线的 Fuelv1, Fuel 与今天的 ORus 的最大区别在于，它运行一个全新的 VM 架构，即 FuelVM 及其工具链和语言。FuelVM 具有 WASM、EVM 和 Solana 的 SeaLevel 的特征。FuelVM 最引人注目的潜在方面是它在基于 UTXO 的数据模型上执行。\n\n关于未来多 VM 的格局的想法我们也在 [CosmWasm：进化的虚拟机与智能合约](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/iHNGFwTAEDGAUuuK4UPtyBt4XNIDFWX94Q68XpHw2yg)一文中进行了描述。当然还有轻松部署，有效资源定价等优势，这里我们就不一一讨论了。\n\n![By Delphi Digital](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97UIM9Ih2PyiGmW7h2EWo.png?height=555&width=1080)\n\nCelestia 中最核心的设计是其数据可见采样 (DAS)，这也是欺诈证明/有效证明的前提。而 DAS 的关键在于抹除码技术，这意味着任何数据通过抹除码技术，可以实现数据大小的翻倍，并且可以通过扩展数据的任何一定百分比的数据，对原有数据进行恢复。通过这种方式，Celestia 上的轻节点可以以数据采样的方式，获取小块数据，并且基于较高的概率，保证数据的可见性。\n\n当然为了确保足够的数据样本，从而用于恢复数据，这个抽样过程应该保证参与节点的数量。DAS 的一个核心特点是当参与节点采集的数量越多，采集的数据越多，那么基于同样的概率假设下，更多的数据可以被验证。所以理论上，当参与的节点数量越多，区块的大小可以更大，支持更多 TPS，这个和单片链的设计不同，在单片链中，节点数量越多（全节点验证），为了确保去中心化的实现，区块大小/燃料限制的设置抑制状态的增长，从而降低了全节点的成本。\n\n当然这个设计的 trade off 问题就是尽管轻节点可以享有与全节点同等的安全性，但是其受限于 O(√n) 的带宽成本，其中 n 为区块大小。所以 Celestia 数据可见的吞吐量主要受限于以下两点：\n\n1. 可以集体采样的数据量\n2. 轻节点的目标块头大小\n\n目前 Celesita 上的节点类型包括两种：\n\n共识节点\n\n验证节点：参与共识。\n\n共识全节点：同步区块链历史的 Celestia-App 全节点。\n\n数据可用性节点\n\n桥节点：在数据可用性网络和共识网络之间桥接区块。\n\n全存储节点：存储所有数据但不连接共识。\n\n轻节点：轻客户端在数据可用性网络上进行数据可用性采样。\n\nOptimint 是允许链作为 Rollups 部署于 Celestia 的产品。这些链可以启动自己的 P2P 网络，将交易数据收集到区块中，并且将他们发布到 Celestia 主网，负责数据可见和共识。Optimint 本质上是一个供开发人员使用的框架，基于其搭建的链无需寻找安全的验证器，Celestia 会为他们处理工作。\n\nOptimint 可以理解为 Celestia 的共识层，它提供了一个交易排序框架，可用于数据可用性层和结算层（但是不参与交易的验证）。这个似乎和我们下文将介绍的 Cosmos Hub 即将上线的跨链安全的理念相似，而 Optiminent 是否会对跨链安全造成威胁，我们也将结合他们共识的差异性来判断。但尽管如此，我们认为 Celestia 的先进理念，以及其在 Cosmos 和以太坊生态中的重要性要等到上线后才能得知（2023 年）。对 Celestia 感兴趣的，可以看我们的 [Celestia 的模块化架构](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/fzB21y2BH7mIzVblrmnzsUrvk3fB3BhYDJO__Nb_Lgw)和 [Celestia 2 - 技术实践](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/q1ig8FgutU5HAOqfO0IkDxIzew8ZA2Fl0-eFVr2HRfs)。\n\n## 跨链安全\n\n跨链安全本质上可以理解为租借安全性，目前 V1 版本中仅支持 Cosmos Hub 的全部节点。当然对于模块本身，是一个可插拔，可选择的模块。对于选择接入的消费链而言，在 V1 版本中，消费链必须强制接入 175 个验证节点，并且需要治理通过, 本质上是一种带有准入机制的产品。消费链需要提交团队的核心产品，和理念，在确保足够的 Atom 持有者投票通过后，才可以接入。同时，消费链也需要支付一定的费用（% 通胀费用）给到验证者节点，这个比例也需要在治理提案中明确，同时在 V1 中，消费链将 75% 的燃料费给到国库 DAO，又多签钱包管理，而 25% 的燃料费给到 Hub, 激励验证节点和质押者。\n\n在我们之前的文章中也提到过，团队可以选择创建（体现了灵活性和可选择性）“自定义消费链” 或 “合约消费者链（通过 CosmWasm 实现）”。两者之间的主要区别在于验证节点运行的二进制文件。合约消费者链中的二进制文件是标准的，而自定义消费链中，团队可以灵活地自定义二进制文件以适应不同的交易费用和交易组装。ICS 总共会有三个版本，第一个版本是消费链的安全完全由 Cosmos Hub 节点维护。而这些消费链是否能够接入需要 Cosmos Hub 通过治理根据他们的风险概况最终决定（比如是一条基于 Cosmwasm 开发的消费合约链还是一条 SDK 无变化的消费自定义链）。\n\n因此，Atom 质押者需要决定他们质押的验证节点，因为在享受额外收益的同时，也会面临和其他 POS 链一样消费链节点宕机和不当行为风险。第一个版本中，消费链和 Cosmos Hub 享有了共同的安全保证。但这种情况下的参与 ICS 的节点所质押的 Atom 价值和这些节点会面临的 Slashing 风险。同时，对于验证节点来说，需要额外的硬件要求，从而保证工作量。而第二个版本中，消费链可以将自己的质押代币与 Cosmos Hub 的 Atom 代币相结合，并最终确定消费链的验证器集组成。而 V3 版本中，这种关系会进一步扩大和加深，可以在双向大型网络间实现横向共享安全协议，Cosmos Hub 可以和任何其他 Cosmos SDK 项目的验证集共享 Atom 价值，反之亦然，可以将其理解为主权网络的相互安全保险。而在 V3 版本中，Hub 验证节点可以有权停止验证哪条链。第二，三个版本相较于第一个版本，网络安全将最终取决于消费链和供应链共同的安全。\n\n而对于 Cosmos Hub 的部分参与的节点来说，如果消费链上的唯一验证节点恶意进行攻击，会有女巫攻击的可能性。目前可以关注的项目包括 Quicksilver 和 Neutron(P2P，一个大节点搭建的自定义合约链）。对于跨链安全想要进一步了解的，可以看深度分析 Cosmos 的开拓者 - [Osmosis，继 IBC 之后，看 ICS, ICA 如何重构加密行业](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/uHyMMkSaTY5T2AjRm8ctbFyUTp14jIou9c_xv4XvsHg)和 [Cosmos Thessis- Osmosis 应用主权链的崛起](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/yPWoPgFyNWzQgkFskpt03oaDv9uKJj3wPHG_m5TV6N4)。\n\n## dYmension\n\ndYmension 对于自己的定位，认为其对于 rollups 的重要性类似于 Cosmos 对于整个区块链行业的重要性。dYmension 是基于 Cosmos 搭建的结算层和执行层，给 Rollups 提供了灵活和可选择的 chain-agnostic 执行层环境。核心的产品（Rollups Development Kit) RDK 开发套件, 类似于 CosmosSDK 模块，目前除了 dYmension, Celestia 和 Cosmos 也在开发 RDK。这个开发套件为开发者提供了在 Cosmos 上轻松构建 Rollups 的所有工具和基础架构。dYmension 目标为 enshriend rollups，而非 Discret Rollups。Enshrined rollups 有更多的灵活性和选择，为用户提供了更多的灵活度，以及保证了最大化安全和稳定，而 Arbitrum, Optimism, StarkNet, zkSync, Aztec etc. 等为代表的 Disrete Rollups 则提供了好的技术路径和品牌。Polynya 认为短中期，discret rollups 会被大部分用户接受，而长期来讲，两者方案可能可以实现共存。\n\n同时，dyMension 也试图在解决 keeper 困境，女巫攻击等问题。Keeper 问题可以表现为，在某些情况下，套利者因为无利可图，或者激励不明确，所以针对某些仓位（比如 MakerDAO 上 120 美金的小仓位), 并不会进行清算，这导致了巨鲸可以将大仓位分散为不同仓位，通过付出一定成本，而保证仓位不受清算，影响网络整体稳定性的可能性。当然对于这个门槛值，由于受到不同市场环境，时间等影响，并没有办法进行确认。尽管 MakerDAO 清算 2.0 升级有望使整个清算过程更加简单和可预测。然但是实际情况要更为复杂，为了应对一些黑天鹅事件，这些清算者通常要提前几个月准备复杂的交易和对冲系统，这对于散户来说是无法想象的。\n\n目前市场上大部分清算系统都是激励给最快的清算者，这使得网络暴露在大量的 MEV 风险下，使得很多的收益给到了矿工，而不是真正的清算者，所以对于很多专业的做市商而言，他们也并没有参与搭建相关的系统，并且参与整个清算过程。Dymension 的具体解决方案目前还不能共享，但是我们在这个赛道也看到了很多其他的竞争对手，比如 Kujira, 在脱离了 Terra 生态的束缚后，在短短 1 个月多的时间里，完成了应用链的部署，并且迅速跻身于 mapofzone 前十的位置。Kujiara 的清算方法采用了不同的方法。平仓池由持有需要平仓头寸的合约直接调用。确保可以在链上搜索可清算头寸需要做更多的工作，但这意味着所有价值捕获都交给了矿池参与者。\n\n对于更复杂的头寸，用户可以轻松地在链上进行索引和搜索，Kujiara 会向机器人运行者提供一小笔 “曲柄” 费用以帮助实际执行清算，但资金仍将来自清算池。所以它仍然是民主的，并且有足够的规模来清算最大的贷款。项目的更多信息我们之后分享给社群小伙伴。dYmension 仍然非常早期，我们将持续关注其之后的发展，本质上你可以理解为以太坊的执行层和结算层设计，但是他继承了 Cosmos 设计的精髓，比如 Rollups 之间的互操作性（Thanks to the IBC and Cosmos 的原生互操作性）以及模块化设计（可插拔以及轻松部署等开发者用好体验）。当然还有可定制化执行环境的 Saga，这里我们就不详细阐述了，各个解决方案的对比可以见下图。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4YdfzfNVotLnt2BhhwycO.png?height=1048&width=900)\n\n## 总结\n\n至此，我们梳理了市面上大部分的 Cosmos 生态的垂直扩展性解决方案。当然我们目前以太坊-rollups centric 的地位仍然不可撼动，所以在我们关注 Cosmos 的同时，我们也需要密切关注以太坊上的发展以及 Solana 这种在执行层发力，创新（而非共识层）的公链。Fuel V1 作为以太坊上推出的第一个 ORUs，目前是唯一具有欺诈证明、不可变智能合约和无许可区块生产, 为 P2P 支付而设计的 Rollups。而 Fuel V2 将会是一个模块化执行层，在 UTXO 上提供以太坊式的智能合约，使用 Ethereum/Celestia 进行结算、数据可用性和共识，切入多个应用场景。\n\n我们看到共识层的创新很多，Bitcoin,EVM,Tendermint 他们都是建立底层共识算法维护网络免受攻击的系统。但是真正在现实工业应用中，执行层的需求量或许更大，用户需要更便宜的燃料费用，网络需要更高吞吐量和性能，Solana, Aptos/Sui 这种链也正试图解决执行层问题。我们将在之后的文章中讨论。\n\n## Reference\n\n[Vertical Scaling is Coming to the Cosmos](https://medium.com/chorus-one/vertical-scaling-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-9d10ebbdde46)\n\n[Pay Attention To Celestia](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/pay-attention-to-celestia)\n\n[The Keeper’s dilemma: Game theoretic analysis of liquidation incentives, with preliminary empirical results](https://medium.com/b-protocol/the-keepers-dilemma-game-theoretic-analysis-of-liquidation-incentives-with-preliminary-b588e82e4d67)\n\n[enshrined rollups](https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1507586019171835905?lang=en)", "timestamp": 1658595834, "digest": "r7bk6K1ewZWFMh0apuBGGx0GuTyjMdtsWCCCwZSsPDI", "contributor": "0xf1E26c020a084E77A4931fEE4c997a2b064566fc"}

Instead, you just load it with the tokens that are required to cover the gas fees.\n\nThere are a lot of phishing scams out there in the form of free mints and giveaways, which by default have an \"all approve\" permission.\n\nIf you are using a single wallet to interact with such contracts, then all your assets and valuables get drained in a matter of clicks.\n\nNot only phishing, you can also expect social engineering attacks.\n\nWhere people get in touch with you in the name of collaboration and work their way up to building trust. Later, they ask you to connect your wallet to a website and boom.\n\nSo the thumb rule is to never ever connect your wallet to an unverified source.\n\nBut your gut feeling is telling you to connect, then use the burner wallet.\n\n## Layer 2: Main Wallet\n\nThis is the wallet that you use to connect to verified sources like platforms, protocols, and exchanges.\n\nOne rule you can attach to the wallet is that, I will only connect this wallet to the official links from my bookmarks, never from any other sources.\n\nIt's good practise to bookmark the official links of platforms, protocols, and exchanges that you frequently use, so that you can avoid clicking on spam and phishing links.\n\nCompared with the burner, the main wallet is limited to interacting only with contracts that you trust.\n\n## Layer 3: Cold Wallet\n\nThis is your safe vault, where you don't interact with any contracts at all.\n\nSometimes people refer to hardware wallets as \"cold wallets,\" but that's not true. Cold wallets are defined based on how you use them.\n\nA cold wallet can be any wallet that you never use to interact with contracts and keep it offline.\n\nJust move your assets to and from the main wallet, and keep it offline. It's more like a freeze on your assets.\n\nI pretty much covered the aspects of the three-layer wallet system.\n\nAs a revision:\n\n* Use a burner wallet to ape into any contract.\n* If anyone asks you to interact with a contract, use the burner.\n* Beware of phishing, scams, and social engineering attacks.\n* Keep your main wallet interaction limited to a set of trusted contracts.\n* Always bookmark the official link to avoid phishing and scams.\n* For long term plays, use a cold wallet and freeze your assets.\n\nThree-layer wallets are only a small part of crypto security.

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v16hrHR9sTizB4b2seyx5.png?height=459&width=832)\n\n以太坊rn就是我们所说的 \"单片机\"。因为共识、执行和数据可用性都发生在ETH区块链上。这不是可持续的，这就是为什么它不能扩展。因为这意味着所有节点都必须执行这3个功能\n\n为了扩大规模，Eth必须成为 \"模块化\"。这意味着只将区块链用于其最擅长的领域：共识，并将执行和数据可用性（DA）的负担转移到链外。\n\n但是，我们如何以完全继承L1的安全性的方式来移动执行和DA？\n\nzk rollups 通过zk + rollup，数以千计的tx被打包成一个单一的、可被数学验证的zk证明，并且只有这个证明被存储在链上。\n\n现在我们来比较一下@zksync 和 @StarkWareLtd . 将尽量保持清晰，并遵循这个计划。\n\n* 团队和开端\n* 技术\n* 数据可用性\n* 资金和支持者\n* 目前的产品和路线图\n* 个人印象和机会\n\n**团队和开端。**\n\n       @StarkWareLtd  始于2018年5月。该团队由世界级的密码学家和科学家组成。核心人员是前Zcash首席科学家，多年来一直是zk领域的创新先锋。他们有很多顶尖的学术论文。用Starknet. 网络变成现实世界的产品。无疑是这场游戏中最著名的团队\n\n       @zksync : 从2019年12月开始。实际上，在zk领域有一个 \"第二好\"的称谓，那就是正在建设ZkSync的Matter实验室团队。该公司由 @gluk64创建（我没能找到......更多关于其背后的顶尖大脑的信息），但ZkSync 2.0带来的技术突破为他们说话。他们有外来者的气势，而且行动迅速。\n\n**技术。**\n\n两个项目都有一个类似的架构。\n将会有一个插入Eth区块链的rollup智能合约**，它将存储L2状态转换的zk证明**。另外，将有2种链外行为者负责为网络提供动力。***provers  和 validator***\n\n        **证明人（provers**）:负责繁重工作的少量节点。它们计算所有的txs，并将其汇总为简洁的zk证明。它们在专用硬件上运行，可以是黑盒子。我们所知道的是，它们在数学上无法伪造假的ZK证明。\n\n        **验证者(validator**): 负责抗审查的大量节点。他们验证证明者提交的证明的有效性。不需要特定的硬件。每个人都可以运行它\n\n另外，这两个项目都必须竞相克服一个主要的技术问题，那就是创建一个**通用的ZK证明系统**这是一个该死的圣杯，因为直到现在所有的ZK电路都需要特定的应用例如starkware的starkex。这意味着每个应用只有一个ZK rollup，而且没有EVM兼容性。你猜怎么着，@zksync和 @StarkWareLtd 都做到了，但技术不同\n\n       @StarkWareLtd ：他们使用的加密货币是基于STARKs的。他们是这项技术的先驱，与SNARKs（由ZkSync使用）相比有两个主要优势。\n\n* T \"意味着 \"透明\"(transparent)，这意味着该系统无需信任设置即可工作\n* 它的产出速度比SNARKs快10倍\n* 但是也有drawbacks缺陷 ,STARKs的问题是技术不如SNARKs成熟，如果它允许图灵完备性，就很难使其与EVM兼容。\n\n  Starkware创造了Cairo，一种特定的最接近图灵完备的编程语言，允许运行由STARKs驱动的自主程序，但由于人们想学习一种新的编程语言来做智能合约的门槛太高，他们现在正与 @nethermindeth 创建Warp，这是一个可以将solidity智能合约无缝转换为Cairo的转码器，以便使 @StarkWareLtd 与EVM兼容\n*     @zksync : 使用的zk系统是基于SNARKs（尤其是PLONK）。因此，该系统的整个安全性在于2019年秋季发生的一个可信仪式。它吸引许多有名的加密货币玩家，其中包括 @VitalikButerin\n* @zksync 的证明逻辑是如果至少有一个参与者是诚实的，那么这个系统是可以证明是安全的，尽管ZkSync团队做了很多优化，SNARKs比STARKs慢。但他们的系统允许EVM兼容...比STARKs更亲民的方式是，事实上，智能合约可以（几乎）由ZkSync编译器逐个转换操作码，这使得solidity成为ZkSync的 \"主要语言\"。不需要中介语言或转码器\n*  **数据可用性 Data availability （DA）**。\n\n      zk rollups将txs计算的承担从L1中移出，并允许ETH扩展到2-3K tps。这很好，但还不够，仅仅采用 \"rollup \"的方法，DA的负荷仍然在L1上，而tx数据通过calldata写在L1上。\n* DA是超级重要的。这是允许你在Etherscan上看到你的tx发生了什么的原因。没有它，TX的执行就成了一个黑盒子。如果你喜欢便宜的tx而不是在L1上直接追踪，这是可以实现。因此，zk rollup必须向用户提供一个选择。要么你的tx数据写在L1上，但费用高一点，要么你优先考虑超便宜的tx，并信任L2上的一些实体来保证你tx数据的可用性。这样，L1就可以从DA负担中解放出来，而ZKrollup可以扩展到20-30k TPS。\n\n              @StarkWareLtd ：用Volition系统解决DA的挑战。Volition允许终端用户在其tx的滚动结算（链上DA）和单个tx层面的有效结算（链下DA）之间做出选择。\n\n![https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/flfNsjVNOyrI8gWzBQOOB.png?height=358&width=717)\n\n如果是 validium方案，链外DA由一个中心化的 \"数据可用性委员会\"（DAC）保证，该委员会由著名的加密货币实体组成。\n\n![听起来像中心化，但是......这是终端用户的权衡后自愿选择的超低价交换。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AnlcFv7nO16Mu1CKIOYfd.png?height=364&width=754)\n\n      @zksync DA的解决方案是zkPorter 它是一个分片基础设施，与ZkSync的zk rollup无缝运行。想象一下，ZkSync rollup是保证链上DA的shard0。然后其他分片可以选择不同的DA政策并在链外存储Tx数据。。\n\n![https://blog.matter-labs.io/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf?gi=c344827caa99](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RTnS9AHnn5eSbRrBp2wll.png?height=392&width=755)\n\n 差异主要体现在：@StarkWareLtd的**Volition**和@zksync **zkPorter**，它们两主要区别是，Volition的方案是基于tx的选择（用户为每个tx选择DA），而zkPorter是基于账户的（一个zkPorter账户使用链外Da产生tx）\n\n另外，对于zkPorter来说，链外DA系统更加去中心化，因为DA是由ZkSync原生代币激励的 \"守护者 \"网络而不是中心化的 \"DAC \"来保证的。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r5vDDD1TduwbA4bhzZ_jt.png?height=382&width=1334)\n\n**资金和支持者**\n\n        @StarkWareLtd

@zksync生态系统的快速整合\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0UOcAqPBZVbenhx8TDkl9.png?height=554&width=844)\n\n**目前的产品和路线图。**\n\n      @StarkWareLtd : 令人难以置信的演变，因为他们坚持不懈地将其顶级密码学论文转化为现实世界的创新。他们的路线图总结如下\n\n![roadmap of starkware ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/opz2MtAhS3Bw7D98lGPeJ.png?height=542&width=1130)\n\n他们首先推出了StarkEx，这相当于 \"Planets \"阶段，并允许创建由Cairo和STARKs驱动的有权限的、特定应用的ZKrollup。 如果你不清楚，看看@dydxprotocol@Immutable或@deversifi 。因为它们是3个由StarkEx的版本驱动的主要应用程序 到目前为止，StarkEx已经通过这些应用程序解决了超过500万的交易量和2500亿美元的价值。StarkEx的效率现在已经得到了证实。于是@StarkWareLtd迅速进入了路线图的 \"Constellations \"阶段。\n\n11月29日，他们在主网上发布了StarkNet的Alpha版本。**StarkNet是我们所期待的无权限、多应用、通用的zkrollup**\n\n[https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-now-on-mainnet-4cf35efd1669](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-now-on-mainnet-4cf35efd1669)\n\n起初，StarkNet将由一个集中式验证器provers提供验证，应用程序将被部署\n\n![roadmap of zksync](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1Ey_XZLj2WIASL0MmHQm3.png?height=336&width=1365)\n\n        @zksync  的路线图通过4个步骤总结如下。 第一阶段对应于2020年6月推出的ZkSync 1.0，大致对应于zk rollup，但没有智能合约整合。你可以发送和接收代币,尽管缺乏可组合性，但有前途的项目已经在其上部署，所有指标都显示对ZkSync 1.0的兴趣呈指数增长\n\n[https://dune.com/kylin/Zksync](https://dune.com/kylin/Zksync)\n\n路线图的第二阶段将随着ZkSync 2.0的主网部署而启动，它对应的是我们期待的一切：Zk rollup上的完全EVM兼容性和智能合约的可组合性\n\nZkSync 2.0最初计划于8月在主网上发布，但技术问题推迟了发布。这些困难现在在测试网得到了解决，去年10月@zksync宣布即将完成技术步骤，并部署了一个类似于AMM的测试网来证明EVM的兼容性,Matter Lab为确保LLVM/Solidity的兼容性而采取的延迟，一开始可能会让人感到沮丧，但它会帮助@zksync 通过允许每个以太坊 工具和对其的依赖性与 ZkSync 2.0 本地集成来赢得大量时间\n\n**个人印象和机会。**\n\n@StarkWareLtd这是我在一段时间内看到的最有前途的基础设施项目。全明星团队，世界级的创新，顶级的资金。令人印象深刻的是，他们不仅仅是在建造一个ZK rollup。他们还建造 Cairo语言和Warp转码器。 同时他们也在努力通过 Veedo 为 Eth 带来真正的随机性，通过有条件的 txs 进行 L1s 到 L2s 的通信，Batch-Long 闪电贷和其他炸爆天的天才的东西。他们解决 AMM 流动性的方法。用 \"分布式AMMs \" 处理L1和L2之间的碎片化真的很鼓舞人心。他们望眼全球。他们正在思考大问题。\n\n[https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3)\n\n我现在看到的@StarkWareLtd 的唯一技术问题是通过Warp转码器进行的Solidity集成。Starknet首先是为Cairo优化的，而Solidity转译器是在它上面添加的。我不是一个技术人员，但我担心 \"Solidity转译 \"将无法实现。直截了当的说，它可能会导致与一些智能合约的兼容性问题。 我看到的其他问题是：我们这些平民百姓的机会在哪里？\n\n另一方面，我喜欢@zksync社区第一的做法。以及对 \"Solidity作为主要语言 \"的强调。他们的整个技术努力依赖于真正的EVM体验，没有任何取舍，这可能会在普遍性方面得到回报。@zksync 也与当前的Defi/CEX深度融合，这对未来的协议加入和采用是一个好兆头。就机会而言，ZkSync已经宣布了原生代币的存在，他们将做一个公平的发布和潜在的空投\n\n\\--the end ", "timestamp": 1658596704,

开始，我总感觉自己对它的了解差了一环。为此我决定自己发一组图片 NFT 试试。\n\n发 NFT 有两种方法，一是直接去大平台手动发；一是通过智能合约发。前者简单快速，但不方便自定规则；后者更灵活、自由，但需要一定开发工作，这也是目前 NFT 主要交易平台 OpenSea 上项目的主流选择。\n\n发 NFT 时之所以需要借助编程或大平台，是因为这不像在网上发一张图那么简单。与 BTC、ETH 一样，NFT （非同质化代币）都是一种区块链中的代币，本质是一串链上代码；但不同的是，一组 NFT 中的每一个都是独一无二、相互区分的，而不像 BTC 那样是相互等价的。由此，通过在单个 NFT 中写入图片、音乐、文字等信息，就能铸造出可在区块链上流转的数字内容，区块链技术保证了 NFT 持有者对这些内容的坚固所有权。是否认可这种所有权因人而异，有人会说电子图片人人可以复制。就像至今仍有人认为，软件，这种看不见摸不着的代码并不需要花钱买。\n\n我会编程，一度认为自己写智能合约不是问题。智能合约是存储在区块链上的程序，在满足一些条件时会自动运行。我对 NFT 的需求很简单：这是个实验，我希望发出去的 NFT 只给到指定朋友，且不可转卖。我希望我的朋友也能体验自己动手铸造 NFT 的过程，而不是直接像转账一样接受我转过去的 NFT。这些需求只能通过智能合约完成。\n\n作画部分，我请来了一位艺术家朋友帮我设计 NFT 图案。构思阶段，他说 “要不就画你吧”，以我，作者本人的东北街（发 gāi 音）溜子风格为原型，发个 Gailiuzi NFT。20 位经常一起出门溜达的好友报名了这个实验。艺术家朋友给每个人画了一个 Gailiuzi 版本的他 / 她，组成了这个项目。\n\n![Gailiuzi NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HthJsUftu4vHLQcPM00cq.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n我有自信这是一个晚上就能完成的实验。但我错了。\n\nBlackIDE 是目前流行的智能合约开发工具，精通它的合约工程师告诉我，智能合约不难，半天一天就好了。但如果想把前端网站等一系列功能都实现，那还要多个一两天。大致流程如下：\n\n* 用一些开发者工具写智能合约，规定好发行量、发售价格、白名单、流通等规则。\n* 用代码组合画好的物料，定义不同元素的稀有度，生成整组图片。\n* 将图片上传服务器并将图片地址写入智能合约。\n* 测试没问题后，正式将智能合约部署上链。\n* 制作一个前端网站，方便用户铸造 NFT。\n\n可我赶时间，只好认怂用 OpenSea 提供的页面铸造 NFT 后发送给朋友。并且叮嘱朋友不要转卖，这是约定，不是智能合约。\n\n虽然和最初目标有些差别，发布总算搞定了，可实验还是失败了：前文说这张图卖不出去五块钱，实际上白送都送不出去。因为超过一半的参与者并没有可接收 NFT 的区块链钱包。他 / 她们在报名参与实验时还没意识到，NFT 是不能用微信、iMessage 等惯常通信方式发送的，不要钱的也不行。\n\n实验揭示了 NFT 的特性和现状：在我们看到的图片、文字、音频背后，NFT 仍是一个需要编程的技术。和早期的互联网一样，它对用户尚不够友好，这使 NFT 在人群中渗透十分有限。\n\n对 NFT 是什么、价值几何，人们现在众说纷纭，乃至两极分化。有人认为对 NFT 的追捧不过是又一场投机：它是新时代的郁金香，互联网的普洱茶，是一个转瞬即逝的炒作热点。也有人把 NFT 视为进入某个圈子的门票、艺术品，或者一种建立数据为使用者所有的去中心化社交网络的基石。\n\n在一个复杂事物的早期阶段，贸然下判断并不明智。刚一了解就 “All in”，或直接给出 “毫无价值” 的评价都不负责任。这篇文章也不会给出关于 NFT 的简单结论。它是一个 NFT 实践者向更多实践者的求证。每个人都给出了自己的那块拼图。\n\n**头像**\n\n有人认为 NFT 头像毫无意义；但对另一些人来说，NFT 头像确实有无法替代的社交价值。在物理世界，身份标识多元且便于快速辨认：发型、衣着、神态、姿势、随身携带的物品……；在线上世界，快速判断一个人更困难，可用素材无非头像和社交网络介绍等。\n\n而当你的头像是一只看起来很无聊的猴子时，一切却不同了，它能传递出具体、特定的信息。对某群人来说，这是一个暗语，它意味着这个头像背后很可能是一个有钱的区块链意见领袖。\n\n 这只猴子叫 “无聊猿”，由 10000 张图片组成，来自一个叫无聊猿游艇俱乐部（Bored Ape Yacht Club, BAYC）的 NFT 项目。本周三时，最便宜的无聊猿约为 94 ETH（ETH 即以太坊，94 ETH 目前约为 94 万元人民币）。\n\n![BAYC #7990 持有者是 NBA 球星斯蒂芬·库里](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lQ3287p65GfZkGj5rclt1.png?height=498&width=886)\n\n金沙江创投合伙人朱啸虎在今年 4 月花 170 ETH（当时约 227 万元人民币）买了编号为 #9279 的无聊猿，用它当自己的微信头像。他的同路人还有蔡文胜、李宁和绿地集团。\n\n有人会想，朱啸虎花了两百多万买的图片，其他人不是也可以右键另存吗？但 NFT 所用的技术保证了，全世界的链上节点都能证明这张图片的确属于朱啸虎的钱包地址 allenzhu.eth，而非其他人。\n\n这些头像帮部分人建立了对彼此的认知。一张 NFT 胜过一大串自我介绍。\n\n身份标识之外，拥有某些特定 NFT 还意味着加入一个社区和拥有相应权益。在美国知名投资人 Kevin Rose 的 NFT 项目 Moonbirds（月鸟）中，持有者可加入专属社区，这里有诸多独家消息，可以旁观知名用户的私下交流。Kevin Rose 本身是这个行业最重要的意见领袖之一。\n\n无聊猿团队 BAYC 则会直接给无聊猿持有者，即社区成员发放代币，许诺这些代币未来可在 BAYC 元宇宙项目中使用。它们现在也可以直接在加密货币交易所里买卖。\n\n持有者还能基于无聊猿形象做 IP 开发和商业活动。比如今年 4 月，李宁在北京三里屯太古里核心区域开了一家以 #4102 号无聊猿为主题的快闪店，同店里还李小龙的联名款。\n\n这是有关 NFT 价值的第一种答案：它是一种身份认证、一种小圈子里的图腾、一种社区入场券、一种标榜自己拥抱 Web 3 的标签。\n\n**标的**\n\nNFT 跌宕起伏的价格，让它获得了另一个定义：NFT 是割韭菜的游戏，本质是金融标的。\n\n“涨了叫我易总，跌了叫我小易。我都不知道它为啥跌、为啥涨。” 当我问 NFT 项目 X Rabbit Club（XRC）的创始人易水寒我该怎么称呼他时，他说。\n\n我们见面时他穿着黑色运动服和运动裤，戴 Apple Watch、黑框眼镜，非常像一位会出现在旧金山 Blue Bottle 的创业者。在 XRC 之前，易水寒做出了中文互联网风靡一时的形象 “冷兔”，一只无厘头的粉色兔子。XRC 项目因此启动伊始就备受关注，被视作 Web 2.0 从业者拥抱 Web3 的前奏。\n\n![X Rabbit #6370](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JNsZG1w-RGCJaGemqpAMc.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n \n NFT 是可以直接在交易网站上购买或竞拍的，但如果你想入手一个新项目尚未发售的 NFT，就有点麻烦了。\n\n绝大部分 NFT 都会限制数量，几百、上千最多一万，兼具唯一性和稀缺性才能提升价格。优质项目供不应求，玩家迫切希望第一时间抢到 NFT，这就像 A 股打新，行情好时抢到就是赚到。\n\n抢新项目的过程被称为铸造（mint），即将购买记录写入区块链。写入过程需要强大的算力，提供算力的人被称作 “矿工”，他们通过完成计算获得矿工费（gas fee），矿工费由铸造 NFT 的玩家出，所以 “打新” 一张 NFT 的成本是其售价加矿工费。\n\n铸币过程是计算速度的竞赛，谁先把购买记录写入区块链，NFT 就是谁的。所以当一些热门 NFT 发售时，全球区块链用户的竞争会哄高矿工费；出价高的铸币需求被处理，出价低的出局，矿工费不退。这种出价竞争即 Gas War。\n\n不是所有人都需要进入这场战争，NFT 项目一般会用一套白名单规则确保特定钱包账户一定能成功铸造规定数量的 NFT。\n\n这是一种寻找种子用户的运营手段。以 XRC 为例，当用户在项目聊天社区中达到最高等级，并对 XRC 进行二次创作时，可获得白名单资格，一共 3500 个名额，每个白名单地址可最多铸造两个 NFT，铸造单价为 0.0502 ETH（当时约 665 元人民币）。易水寒希望筛选出认可 XRC 价值并能帮助二次传播的玩家。XRC 也和一些知名 NFT 社区合作，转发抽取白名单资格。\n\n今年 1 月初，在公开发售的前几天，XRC 的地板价（实时更新的最低价格）快速超过了 1 ETH（当时约 1.36 万元人民币），平均价格则达到了 1.39 ETH（当时约 1.89 万元人民币）。这意味着白名单玩家所持的 NFT 在几天内上涨了近 30 倍。\n\n当某种可以作为资产的物品具有极高的流动性且价格不菲时，它一定带有金融属性。\n\n一些 NFT 买家在社交网络直言：“不要忘记进初心，初心就是赚钱。不要当钻石手（指坚定持有某个资产的人）、不要对图片产生感情，只要有利润就要跑。”\n\n易水寒认为 99% 的人进入 NFT 圈都是为了赚钱，只不过大家给了它一个叙事，“头像变成了一个圈子”，这不改变 NFT 金融标的的本质。\n\nNFT 就像一个成立即上市的公司，从诞生之初就要面对维持股价的压力，NFT 7×24 小时波动；项目方需要每月甚至每周发布各种内容以维持社区期待。\n\nXRC 启动以来，易水寒最大压力是价格涨得太快、太高，涨跌不在控制范围。他原希望价格缓慢往上涨，认为这说明大家对项目有持续认可。但 “你不知道怎么回事，价格就上去了”，这带来了更多维持价格的压力。“有些人甚至希望你涨到 5 个 ETH（当时约 6.7 万元人民币）。” 易水寒说。\n\n在社区的高期待下，项目方任何不利于直接抬升价格的行为，都被抨击为不懂 NFT 玩法。但对一个早期项目来说，在价格之外还有太多要操心的事，它们才是在水下支撑价格的基石。其中最重要的一项是社区运营，核心目标是维持社区的看涨共识。\n\n花一百块买的 NFT 可能就是一张好看的图。但如果涨到一千块、一万块呢？如果随手买的几张图十万块了，谁又能不关心它下一步的走势？这时共识就形成了：社区里的多数人可能认为它还能到二十万，并为此投入更多资金。\n\n维持看涨共识的常见方法是不断发新的 NFT。当一个项目的单价达到 1 或 10 个 ETH 时，可发行第二个 NFT，单价一般是第一个项目的 1/5。第一个 NFT 的持有者，即社区成员可进入白名单甚至获得免费空投（AirDrop，即直接向账户免费发送代币，是常见拉新方法）。2021 年中，无聊猿运营方就给所有持有无聊猿的账户空投了 “无聊犬”（Bored Ape Kennel Club）。\n\n共识有时是脆弱的。一些无心的言行就可能造成方向反转、价格雪崩。今年 5 月急转直下的 Azuki 项目是一个例子。\n\nAzuki 由 10000 个动漫风格的侧脸头像组成，是目前 NFT 市场少有的亚洲风格蓝筹项目。蓝筹一般指该项目可长期稳定保持价值。介于 NFT 市场的快速波动，长期一般按月算。\n\nAzuki 于今年 1 月发售，在今年 4 月曾达到 36 ETH（当时约 51 万元人民币）均价的高点。Azuki #9605 号稀有 NFT 甚至拍出了 142 万美元（约 964 万元人民币）。同一组 NFT 图片一般由人类设计师设计特征，如发型、饰物等，由电脑随机组合特征。组合后的结果越稀有，价值越高。Azuki #9605 大部分特征的出现几率都少于 1%，非常符合旁观者对 NFT 的印象：超贵小图片。\n\n![最贵的 Azuki 图像，价格为买家此刻报价而非实际售价](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sDpnUMQuW1ICA9KZoz3tj.png?height=585&width=1080)\n\n Azuki 系列今年 5 月 4 日的均价还在 32 ETH（当时约 45 万元人民币），可 5 月 12 日却迅速跌至 10 ETH（当时约 14 万元人民币）。这有市场因素，5 月后各 NFT 价格不同程度下降。但主要原因是 Azuki 创始人 Zagabond 在 5 月 10 日发的一篇文章。他提及，自己曾创办另外三个不成功的 NFT 项目，从这些失败中学习了如何成功做好 Azuki。\n\n在传统风投市场，连续创业是加分项。但在 NFT 世界，承认曾经做过不成功的项目，就是承认曾 “rug” 项目，即吸引玩家资金后又放弃运营的恶意行为。仅仅是存在 rug 的可能性， 已足以摧毁持有者的看涨共识。Azuki  价格随后剧烈下跌。\n\n有多少人能从 NFT 中挣到钱？\n\n绝大部分 NFT 项目发售即巅峰，出道就破发。相当多 NFT 甚至没办法被全部铸造完毕。不是所有 NFT 都有流动性，一些 NFT 挂单很久也买不出去。\n\n稳赚的方式是在每轮淘金热中找到卖铲子的生意。\n\n一些工作室专门刷各个项目的白名单，然后倒卖。工作室资金体量大、计算更周密。一个工作室的区块链钱包地址经常能抢到几百个同项目的 NFT。这些工作室挤占了真正玩家的名额，他们只想赚钱，对社区没有共识，也没有建设意愿。项目方要用各种手段对抗工作室。\n\n平台也总是挣钱的。全球交易额最大的 NFT 市场 OpenSea 目前估值超过 100 亿美元。OpenSea 会对每一笔交易收取 2.5% 的手续费。2022 年 1 月，OpenSea 月交易量超过 50 亿美元，仅在 1 月 31 日一天，OpenSea 上就发生了 2.33 亿美元的交易。\n\n区块链行业有一句名言，来自币安创始人赵长鹏（CZ）：“If you can't hold, you won't be rich.”（如果你不能一直拿住，你就不会发财。）\n\n在 NFT 市场，易水寒对这句话有另外的理解，他认为最应拿住的是自己的信用，有信用才能一直待在市场里，能待住就能挣钱，因为 “（这个行业）挣钱机会太多了”。\n\n易水寒和我说这句话时，Azuki 的暴跌还没发生。我把它当做一句陈词滥调。现在，我认为这句 “陈词滥调” 被强调得还不够。\n\n**艺术**\n\n在另一些人眼中， NFT 是加密艺术。这是 NFT 头像大行其道之前，业界对 NFT 最早的理解。\n\n2021 年 3 月，佳士得以 6934.6 万美元成交价拍卖了艺术家 Beeple （本名迈克·温克尔曼 Mike Winkelmann）的作品《每一天：前 5000 天》（EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS），创下在世艺术家作品拍卖纪录的第三名。这也是从事传统艺术拍卖的佳士得第一次拍卖 NFT 作品并接受加密货币支付。\n\n![《每一天：前 5000 天》](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LeqXEfEwQEkqwvtPKizH8.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n《每一天：前 5000 天》是一个巨幅拼接作品。Beeple 自 2007 年 5 月到 2021 年 1 月间，每天创作一副作品，一起拼成了 “前 5000 天”。佳士得称其为 “收藏数码艺术品的里程碑”。\n\n《每一天：前 5000 天》和传统艺术品形态相似，更容易被人理解。成组的 NFT 项目，如头像则不像一般人印象中的艺术。\n\n![CyberPunks](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZSkAJRGo9irXgvZ21Tbv1.png?height=120&width=418)\n\n这一堆像素点组成的头像就是最早的成组 NFT 项目，CryptoPunks。它在 2017 年启动，由 10000 个图片组成。现在的最低单价是 84.85 ETH（约 85 万元人民币）。\n\nCyberPunks 一开始连送都送不出去。直到美国新闻网站 Mashable 在 2017 年年中发表了《这个基于以太坊的项目或许可以改变我们对数字艺术的思考方式（This ethereum-based project could change how we think about digital art）》后，CryptoPunks 才引起注意。\n\n文章的开头是这样的：“有人拥有这张图片……它是艺术，并且有一个拥有者（Someone owns this picture...It is art, and it has an owner）。” 原作者两次强调你可以拥有一张数字图片，它是艺术。\n\n在把 NFT 视作艺术的人看来，NFT 改变了创作者与艺术市场的关系。\n\n@Sleepy0x13 是一位数字艺术家和 NFT 研究者，人们更多叫他睡总。他是华人在 NFT 领域最知名的发声者之一，会帮助其他艺术家孵化自己的 NFT 项目。\n\n睡总认为，NFT 之后，创作者和收藏家的关系从前者服务后者转变为了双方一起做一件事。NFT 从来不属于一个人或一个公司，它属于社区。NFT 一旦发售，持有者就可以通过各种运营活动、二创传播和投票决策参与塑造项目发展方向。\n\n在传统的艺术消费中，艺术家和消费市场间却不必有关联。我可能拥有一书架艺术摄影画册，但我不会和艺术家与艺术品本身产生交集。我暂时拥有某件艺术品，可我和其他所有者，和艺术家之间缺乏沟通渠道。\n\n睡总认为，NFT 带来的新关系更能保障艺术创作者的经济收益，但也需要艺术家学会经营各种社交媒体，自己完成以往策展人的工作。不是所有人都适应变化。睡总接触的很多创作者只管埋头创作和上传作品，而不做社区运营。这类项目基本石沉大海，创作者也没有收益。\n\n并不是所有人都认可现在的 NFT 算是一种艺术。\n\n摄影师与视觉艺术工作者 Tianxi 在天津拥有自己的工作室，专门帮助艺术家和博物馆做艺术品的数字化工作。当过程序员、做过商业拍摄现在全职做艺术，Tianxi 可以说是最适合接触 NFT 的一类艺术家。他认为如果 NFT 项目只是单纯利用了技术，还算不上艺术。这有些像摄影，在摄影刚被发明时它是记录证据的技术，当摄影不止于纪实后，做为艺术的摄影才逐渐出现。\n\n技术不断进步，一代比一代先进，艺术则具有 “不可超越性”——20 世纪的艺术作品并不因为诞生得更晚就好于 15 世纪的作品。Tianxi 对我说，NFT 制造了一种 “仿佛这个东西是可被超越的，用价格评判一切” 的标准，这显然违背了艺术。\n\n在和多位艺术家的交流中，他 / 她们都提到了艺术的纯粹性。所谓审美，就是把艺术当作艺术的能力，而不带有其他功利性目的。但 NFT 充满了其他目的：进入不同的圈子、挣更多的钱、彰显自己的个性……这不符合艺术家对纯粹的理解。一位艺术家甚至说，NFT 可以是任何东西，但绝对不能是艺术。\n\n在区块链领域，和艺术二字挂钩最深的名字是 Pak。有人说 Pak 背后是一个人，也有人认为是一个团队。Pak 在采访中说不认为自己是艺术家，但在许多玩家心中，Pak 的作品是艺术品。\n\nPak 最有趣的作品之一是 2021 年发布的《Merge》：在开放购买的 48 小时内，任何人可以通过拍卖形式购买任何数量的 Merge 项目对应代币 MASS。此后 Merge 项目方会根据每个地址持有的 MASS 数量为这个地址生成一个带有独立编号、质量为代币数量、颜色由持有数量决定的 NFT——其实就是一个点。\n\n![m(2379) #63](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yr0tVJqMtKmmWMHurffCX.png?height=893&width=894)\n\n根据规则，每个加密钱包内只能有一份这样的 NFT。所以当 Merge NFT 在二级市场流动，新购买的 NFT 就会和钱包里原有的融合，生成带有新编号、质量和颜色的 “点”。随时间推移，《Merge》的总点数会越来越少，剩下的点会越来越大。\n\n《Merge》的形式和内容结合得很紧密，如果不是使用智能合约这种形式，如果没有对 NFT 的交易，Merge 中的点就无法变化、融合，智能合约的形式本身是内容的一部分，《Merge》只有在加密世界中才能实现。而其他大多数 NFT 作品，只是把一些物理世界也可以存在的图片放到了区块链里。曾经在科技公司工作、现在主要在东北进行影像工作的艺术家轶轩（就是他画了 Gailiuzi NFT）评价到，如果某张照片在现实中都不是艺术，那凭什么当这张照片通过智能合约的 tokenurl 被读到时，就变成了加密艺术？\n\n轶轩也不认为《Merge》是艺术，他只是觉得《 Merge》比其他作品更有资格放在艺术语境下被讨论。NFT 就像是白纸。白纸不是艺术，但它蕴含了艺术的可能性。关键在于可能。\n\n**更多的可能**\n\n“我” 站在一个巨大的落地窗前，窗边是一把著名现代主义设计风格的巴塞罗那椅。窗外的夜晚因为霓虹灯的映照展现出厚薄不均的亮度。房间不大，但陈列品价值不低：正对着窗户的是一副 CryptoPunks；另一面墙上是两幅 Chromie Squiggle by Snowfro，上面画着彩色波浪线，这个系列过去九十天的均价超过了 10 万元人民币一幅。这仿佛一个美好世界版的《攻壳机动队》。\n\n![Portals Beta](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yKwOxX34_f1-O53WuSeCf.png?height=622&width=1080)\n\n可惜这不是我的家，也不是我的世界。等加载页面结束后，就是 Portals 的世界了，每个新来者都会看到这幅景致。\n\nPortals 是一个基于 Solana 区块链的元宇宙项目——不同的区块链都有自己的特点，前文提到的 ETH 即以太坊，是目前最通用的区块链，Solana 作为后起之秀增速很快。它的矿工费更低，被称为 “穷人的以太坊”，其日 NFT 交易量曾在今年 5 月短暂超越 ETH。\n\nPortals 的 CMO Chris Lund 从来不认为 NFT 会停留在昂贵的 “小图片” 上，他告诉我，Portals 希望创造一个活跃的虚拟城市；用户可在虚拟城市里创造自己的空间。\n\n但这和 Second Life 或模拟人生等游戏有什么区别？Chris 的回答是：NFT。\n\nPortals 将这个虚拟世界的空间分割成不同 Space（空间）。每个 Space 的所有权凭证是一张 “NFT 房卡”。Space 完全属于拥有者，他可以在这里举办自己的活动，出租、转卖空间，这些行为不需经过 Portals 官方同意。\n\n在中心化的线上服务中，线上软件，在线电影、音乐，在游戏里购买的皮肤、武器和道具，用户只享有这一切的使用权而非真正所有权。几千万粉丝的大账号也可能因各种原因被平台禁用或删除。但购买 NFT 时，用户购买的是真正的所有权。\n\nPortals 最便宜的公民卡现在不超过 1000 元人民币，几乎没有手续费。在这里 NFT 的作用，是让用户可在虚拟数字世界中真正拥有一些东西。这些东西不贵，甚至可以免费。“虚拟世界对现实社会越来越重要，但你能想象在虚拟世界里我们没有任何所有权，一切都属于大公司的未来吗？NFT 是解决问题的钥匙。”Chris 说。\n\nPortals 正计划逐渐迁移到去中心化服务器上。一个拥有所有权且去中心化的虚拟空间，也许真有机会成为某个人的第二人生。\n\n也有人希望 NFT 能在线下世界发挥更大作用。\n\nLinksDAO 试图用 NFT 打造世界最棒的高尔夫社区。他们把 NFT 作为会员凭证，通过售卖 NFT 会员卡筹集资金，希望建设一个实体高尔夫球场。\n\n认为现阶段 NFT 作品不等同艺术的 Tianxi，也认可 NFT 可以帮助艺术行业，一个现成的应用是做艺术品交易溯源。传统拍卖行会做这种记录：比如一幅 18 世纪的作品，谁画的、第一手交易是谁、第二手是谁、最后被谁收藏。NFT 可以让这件事更简单高效，出错概率接近于 0。\n\n围绕 NFT 的讨论现在是复杂乃至嘈杂的。一些人认为它是金融标的、一些人认为它是艺术的未来，还有很多人认为它只是每年都会有的技术热点。其实 NFT 还不是一个完成品，而是一个正在进行的试验品。它要追求什么目标、价值几何？相比随便下一个结论，即使选择不回答，也是一种更好的回答。\n\n为什么我会对 NFT 产生兴趣？我到底看中它哪一个维度？我想，恰恰在于它仍未被盖棺定论的 “可能性”。我对 NFT 可能性的相信，本质上是我对数字世界未来的相信。\n\n我的网名 @MasterPa 已伴随我十几年了。我经常和新认识的朋友说：“这个 ID 不论曾说了多脑残的话都是我说的。” 因为我是一个真正把数字世界当作现实世界的人，如果不能在这个世界承担起属于这个名字的责任，那便永远不属于数字世界。\n\nNFT 这个概念对我来说太自然了，它的意义非常简单：在线上世界，确认一些东西属于自己。\n\n上初中时，我写了某种爬行动物的第一份中文饲养教程。一个商家抄走后，堂而皇之说这是他自己写的甚至把内容放进了百科。我无法证明这段文字属于我。曾经有一个修图软件，在用户协议里宣称对被修图片有全球性、不可撤销的版权，如果用户不同意就无法使用。多少人会仔细看协议？就算看到这条，又有多少人会因此不用这个工具？\n\n我是跟着互联网成长起来的一代人，无数人生的重要时刻都发生在互联网上。回看过去二十年我在互联网上创造的内容与回忆，无关价格、无关行业，它们是组成我自身经验的一部分。可大多数内容，我写的文字、拍的照片、和朋友的互动……早已变成电子尘埃消散于中心化的服务器中。NFT 让我看到了阻止这种消散的可能。\n\n我深知今天的 NFT 和区块链还无法解决全部问题。也正因如此，我们这些将互联网视作生命重要组成部分的人，不应将自己视作旁观者。我们需要承担起一些让互联网变得更好的责任。\n\n我承担起了我在数字世界的责任，我也要我在数字世界的权利。\n\n\\* 感谢各位受访者以及 0xchao.eth、CuriousJoe、davey#8335

Минтинг NFT — недолговечное событие. Чеканка NFT часто заканчивается через несколько дней (иногда через часы или даже минуты), и только в этот период активность пользователей чрезвычайно высока. Как только минт завершен, активность пользователя довольно быстро замедляется до точки, когда генерируемый объем от вторичной торговли или других действий может быть легко обработан любым блокчейном.\n\nКроме того, опыт покупки, который выпадает первичным и вторичным покупателям, может сильно различаться. Первичным покупателям часто приходится использовать механизм белого списка, в то время как вторичные покупатели могут купить NFT на торговой площадке по своему выбору в любое время. Кроме того, поскольку вторичные покупатели являются теми, кто управляет объемом торгов NFT, важно убедиться, что им не навязывают радикально отличающийся UX.\n\nFlash Layer для чеканки NFT\n\nКлючевым нововведением, которое AltLayer привносит в пространство решений для масштабирования минтов NFT, является идея одноразовых уровней выполнения. С AltLayer разработчик dApp, ожидающий увеличения спроса на свой NFT, может: 1) быстро развернуть быстрый и масштабируемый накопитель, защищенный первым уровнем, 2) использовать накопитель столько времени, сколько необходимо, и тем самым предотвратить засорение первого уровня, а затем 3) утилизировать накопительный пакет, выполнив расчет «по окончании срока службы» на первом уровне. Это делает всю систему в высшей степени оптимизированной по ресурсам. Уровень выполнения и его ресурсы вызываются только тогда, когда dApp ожидает значительный спрос, который не может обработать первый уровень, и как только спрос снижается, dApp может вернуться к блокчейну первого уровню.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_4OdZWew3iEfwNPfrWcGZ.png?height=785&width=1400)\n\n### Ценностное предложение Flash Layer по сравнению с существующими решениями масштабирования NFT\n\nЦенностное предложение Flash Layer для проектов NFT можно резюмировать следующим образом:\n\n1. **Уровень масштабирования, выделенный для чеканки NFT:** Flash уровень выделяет уровень выполнения, специфичный для чеканки, для каждого проекта NFT. Поскольку блочное пространство зарезервировано для проекта, это означает, что минт может быть полностью изолирован от любой другой активности в сети, что не приведет к перегрузке сети. Проект NFT также сможет сделать процесс майнинга полностью безгазовым. Эта функция не может быть предложена на каких-либо сайдчейнах общего назначения Layer 1, Layer 2 или EVM. В дополнение к зарезервированному блочному пространству для чеканки, уровень флэш-памяти поставляется с высокопроизводительной средой выполнения, способной предложить выделенную пропускную способность 2000 TPS с низкой задержкой блока 1–2 с, обеспечивая бесперебойную работу для чеканки. \n2. **Недолговечный по дизайну:** Flash слой создан специально для чеканки, поскольку он вбирает в себя недолговечность чеканки. Флэш-слой удаляется, как только событие чеканка завершено. Таким образом, участники события чеканки остаются на флэш-слое в течение кратчайшего времени (т. е. только во время чеканки). Это резко контрастирует с решениями масштабирования NFT для конкретных приложений, которые предназначены для постоянного использования. Пользователи флэш-уровня могут продолжать пользоваться знакомым им пользовательским интерфейсом базового блокчейна, за исключением очень короткого периода времени в течение всего жизненного цикла продукта NFT. Это также гарантирует, что компонуемость со сторонними приложениями dApp, такими как приложения для кредитования NFT или игры, не будет нарушена. \n3. **Автоматический расчет активов в базовом блокчейне:** когда флэш-уровень, настроенный для минта NFT, удаляется, система производит расчет всех активов в базовой цепочке, что в основном означает, что все NFT попадают в базовый блокчейн после чеканки. В отличие от решений, которые требуют, чтобы пользователи вручную соединяли активы, автоматический расчет гарантирует, что все NFT будут перемещены в базовый блокчейн без какого-либо вмешательства пользователя. Избегая ручного процесса перетаскивания NFT, уровни флэш-памяти также полностью устраняют любые риски безопасности, связанные с мостом. \n4. **Нефрагментированная ликвидность:** поскольку все NFT перемещаются в базовый блокчейн в конце процесса чеканки, система гарантирует нефрагментированную ликвидность в базовом блокчейне. Это гарантирует, что участникам вторичного рынка не придется переходить из одной сети в другую, чтобы найти NFT, который они хотят купить. \n5. **Знакомый UX для участников минта:** поскольку слои flash работают на том же механизме выполнения, что и базовая цепочка, пользователи, участвующие в мероприятии mint, могут наслаждаться простым и знакомым опытом. Например, если базовой цепочкой является Ethereum, пользователи смогут использовать Metamask или кошельки, совместимые с EVM. Они также могут использовать знакомые активы, такие как USDC или ETH, для участия в продаже NFT. \n6. **Прозрачность для участников вторичного рынка:** любой пользователь, желающий купить NFT на вторичном рынке, не должен касаться флэш-слоя. Поскольку вторичная торговля вносит значительный вклад в общий объем продаж NFT, эта функция гарантирует, что вторичные трейдеры вообще не будут подвергаться воздействию флэш-слоя.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4mnsX_9wQq0Ohj4PTUpgY.png?height=783&width=1400)\n\nВ двух словах, решение Flash Layer для чеканки NFT обеспечивает развертывание одним щелчком мыши, поддержку нескольких цепей, нефрагментированную ликвидность и, что наиболее важно, устранение газовой войны.\n\n### Быстрая демонстрация\n\n[https://youtu.be/OAuKf3WRxGc](https://youtu.be/OAuKf3WRxGc)\n\n### Как начать пользоваться?\n\nБолее подробную информацию о том, как настроить флэш-слой и другие инструменты, можно найти на странице <https://alt-research.github.io/docs/tutorials/nft-mint>.\n\nЕсли вы работаете над проектом NFT и планируете провести минт NFT, свяжитесь с нами по адресу [support@altlayer.io](mailto:support@altlayer.io).

In the metaverse, I frequently visit digital Atlantica and pay my respects to Ariel, the Little Mermaid. And, on rare occasions, she lets me raid her subaqueous wardrobe filled with gleaming gowns and pearly tiaras.\n\nBut resurfacing from these nautical dreams means I need to morph back into my human self and lose my glimmering tail. Much like how the sea’s tides brush the shores as foam, I leave the last drop of seawater as a mermaid and walk the beach transformed again into a woman.\n\nThe idea of this transformation, change and amphibian metamorphosis is encapsulated in a digital fashion collection launched by OnClickCloset and IANA called SEA FOAM.\n\nFrom gorgeous shape-shifting gowns to elegant sea treasures in the form of jewellery, this digital fashion line is a delicately intricate symbiosis of the ever-lasting mysterious beauty of the oceans and our intrinsic connection to them.\n\n“The SEA FOAM Digital Collection of NFT wearables, shoes and jewellery is about the metamorphosis of shapes when one colour merges with another creating a unique and ambiguous pattern,” OnClickCloset and IANA explain on the [Artisant’s site](https://artisant.io/users/0x609cdc763e4f44f03050aa55f38a641e9fb31b90) - the marketplace where the digital fashion garments being sold (digital jewellers Jevels are host to the jewellery aspect of the collection which can be found [here](https://jevels.com/collections/vendors?q=OnClickCloset%20and%20Iana)).\n\n“The main concept of the collection is the natural unpredictability and mystery of water, its hues, and shadows. The SEA FOAM collection is a tribute to abstract art and its deep connection with the natural beauty of life.\n\nThe prints used for the collection are the acrylic paintings of the British painter, sculptor, and writer Peter Bear.”\n\nI was fortunate enough to win the NFT competition hosted by the designers and Glitch Mag to own the digital fabric of these garments (what are the odds, right?). Observing the patterns alone, it’s clear the detail and colour tones literally mirror that of an aquamarine glare of an ocean’s vibrant movement. I’m sure Ariel would be jealous…\n\nOf course, the entire SEA FOAM collection is stunning in my opinion but I selected 3 standout pieces that genuinely caught my eye.\n\n## ABYSS\n\n![Credit: OnClickCloset, IANA and Artisant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i26uF7qF0ybigEYmrvcV4.jpg?height=620&width=1102)\n\nWith wispy sea glass sleeves flowing, the ABYSS dress has a graceful air about it. The high-thigh slit, plunging neckline and the bold print that sends you into blissful hypnosis (the more you stare at it), exude a royalty.\n\nThe final touch is the elegant ABYSS choker that looks like drops of translucent seawater.  “It gives you the hypnotic feeling of starting a journey into the abyssal waters with its mystical fairy tales,” OnClickCloset and IANA.\n\n“As you start looking at the print, you lose yourself falling into infinite alternations of paint. This is why the dress is called ABYSS.”\n\n## PEARL HEELS\n\n![Credit: OnClickCloset, IANA and Artisant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bPf1rtTz4eBw5r64J0Vm9.jpg?height=1433&width=1075)\n\nDeep-blue velvet tone coupled with a glistening pearl border, these PEARL HEELS will easily elevate any digital outfit (and not just literally). The stiletto heel adds that extra dash of seduction to a classic style of shoe. The meta beach party is only getting started when you rock up in these.\n\n## METAMORPHOSIS HEADPIECE\n\n![Credit: OnClickCloset, IANA and Artisant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IfMqb6okUyn8NxpO1yVfc.jpg?height=368&width=515)\n\nThe ultimate aqueous accessory, the METAMORPHOSIS HEADPIECE is reminiscent of a decadent cinnamon swirl. As shiny and smooth as sun-kissed sea glass, the colourful shades reflect indigo blues, seaweed greens and ultraviolet coral.

NFT зберігають метадані в ланцюгах блоків, які зазвичай пов'язані з файлами, що містять мультимедіа, такі як зображення, відео та аудіо, або токенізована відтворення фізичних об'єктів, таких як нерухомість. У 2021 році колекціонери NFT відправили на торгові майданчики NFT понад 40 мільярдів доларів. Це число буде лише частиною суми 2022 року, оскільки станом на 1 травня 2022 року сума вже перевищила 37 мільярдів доларів. Згідно з звітом, опублікованим Chainanalysis, з третього кварталу 2020 року кількість активних трейдерів NFT стабільно зростає щокварталу.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KpBh1YozOHXmEs7BInZeO.png?height=516&width=960)\n\nПочаткова хвиля NFT розпочалася з творів мистецтва та предметів колекціонування (наприклад, [рекордний аукціон Beeple за 69 мільйонів доларів](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million)), зображень профілів, цифрових аватарів та ігрових активів, які зробили NFT синонімом 2D-візуального мистецтва. Однак NFT трансформувалися в інші форми, особливо в музику, яка має більше охоплення, ніж образотворче мистецтво.\n\nМузику люблять набагато більше людей, аніж образотворче мистецтво. Музика явно призначена  для всіх через її набагато ширшу доступність. Насправді вважається, що сектор образотворчого мистецтва значною мірою підтримується [приблизно](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/arts/international/new-report-builds-a-profile-of-the-elusive-art-collector.html) 10 000 колекціонерів творів мистецтва, у той час як музична індустрія [отримує дохід](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/16/2298162/28124/en/Global-Music-Recording-Market-Report-2021-2030-Featuring-Universal-Music-Group-Sony-Music-and-Warner-Music.html) у розмірі 57 мільярдів доларів від мільярдів людей з більш ніж [півмільярдом](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/spotify-subscription-numbers-up-youtube-music-tidal/) користувачів платних стрімінгових сервісів.\n\nБільше того, динаміка галузі робить музику ідеальним представником для прориву Web3. Для більшості артистів **Spotify, який є одним із найбільших споживчих продуктів у цьому секторі, став інструментом для популярності, а не для заробітку**. Згідно з звітом Delphi Digital, 10% найкращих артистів [генерують](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/top-1-percent-streaming-1055005/) 99,4% потоків на Spotify. Тепер стрімінгові платформи [наполягають](https://consequence.net/2021/10/spotify-amazon-pandora-apple-streaming-royalty-rates/) на ще нижчих виплатах артистам. Таким чином, NFT пропонують більшій кількості музикантів можливість заробляти на життя своєю роботою, що, як вважається, прискорює прийняття NFT.\n\nРинок NFT неухильно виходить за межі JPEG і MP3, оскільки вони також можуть бути доказом володіння реальними активами. Існує кілька поточних проектів, які використовують NFT для продажу квитків, нерухомості, а також для підтвердження права власності на реальні предмети, такі як годинник та автомобілі.\n\n### Проблеми масштабованості з NFT\n\nЖиття кожного NFT починається із запуску NFT (також іноді званої “карбування” чи “дропа”). Карбування NFT - це коли нова колекція спочатку створюється, продається і розподіляється серед покупців, які потім вирішують залишити її у себе або продати на вторинних ринках. Оскільки NFT часто карбуються в дуже обмеженій кількості, карбування NFT часто створюють газову війну, яка засмічує мережу великою кількістю невдалих транзакцій.\n\nДекілька популярних блокчейнів першого рівня, а також другого рівня не змогли задовольнити потреби масштабування карбування NFT. Нижче наведено кілька реальних інцидентів, пов'язаних із проблемами масштабованості, з якими зіткнулися NFT події на Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Arbitrum та Solana.\n\n### Ethereum\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sy0NVf13nmR576E00-dpy.png?height=706&width=1200)\n\nEthereum є найбільшою екосистемою смарт-контрактів, і високі комісії за газ досить поширені та не є наслідком NFT. Однак дані показують, що NFT приносять більше трафіку в Ethereum, ніж популярні ERC20 та стейблкоїни. З липня 2021 року частка NFT у загальному обсязі переказів до Ethereum перевищила частку стейблкоїнїв та основних токенів ERC-20. У світлі цього не дивно, що популярний проект NFT може створити навантаження Ethereum під час процесу карбування.\n\nЦе було наочно продемонстровано під час продажу NFT, організованого Yuga Labs 1 травня 2022 року на Ethereum. Попит на NFT був настільки високий, що, незважаючи на впровадження внутрішньомережевого процесу KYC та максимальної допустимої кількості карбування у 2 NFT на KYC-гаманець, мережа Ethereum не змогла впоратися з раптовим сплеском попиту. У результаті Yuga Labs попросила співтовариство подумати про перенесення проекту у власну мережу. Нещодавно це було поставлено на голосування і близько 47% користувачів проголосували за APEChain.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rGu_rrZdZCOLpSLWSWviV.png?height=660&width=1202)\n\n### Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum запланував двомісячну маркетингову кампанію під назвою The Arbitrum Odyssey, яка дасть користувачам можливість випробувати різні проекти екосистеми Arbitrum у мережі та в нагороду отримати ексклюзивні NFT.\n\nПо завершенні першого тижня та подачі заявок на [перший NFT](https://galaxy.eco/arbitrum/campaign/GCCNzUtQiW/), транзакції в Arbitrum досягли рекордно високого рівня, внаслідок чого комісія за транзакції в Arbitrum стала вищою, ніж у Ethereum. У результаті лише через тиждень після запуску, команді Arbitrum довелося різко призупинити роботу програми.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-tgnY3Aoz0Wrf4-ht3_x7.png?height=858&width=1214)\n\n### Polygon PoS\n\nНезважаючи на те, що це не обов'язково було подією карбування NFT, “play to earn” гра [Sunflower на початку січня вносила понад 40% комісій за газ](https://www.playtoearn.online/2022/01/10/sunflower-farmers-hits-the-polygon-network-where-it-hurts-gas-fees/) у Polygon PoS. Гра проіснувала недовго, але на піку популярності вона мала близько 500 тисяч користувачів.\n\nТокеноміка гри була розроблена таким чином, що чим більше людей приєднувалося до гри, тим більше збільшувалася загальна пропозиція, а отже, винагороди зменшувалися. Це означало, що хтось, хто грав у перші дні, отримував значно більше винагород, ніж ті, хто приєднався пізніше. Ця схема привела до високої активності, яка атакувала мережу Polygon.\n\n### Solana\n\nМережа Solana була відключена 2 травня 2022 на 7 годин через велику кількість транзакцій, створених NFT ботами.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CE-CM7g5r1IWtfMcTRWNH.png?height=650&width=1200)\n\nОдин з валідаторів Solana навіть запропонував цензурувати транзакції, призначені для контракту Metaplex, щоб пом'якшити проблему, внаслідок чого інші емітенти NFT просили валідаторів не блокувати їх контракти.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bXcNxQDigZLwFK0B3_fAJ.png?height=843&width=1199)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4wgOPlgzHD-esyv3OPyHc.png?height=389&width=1400)\n\n### Існуючі Рішення та їх обмеження\n\nEthereum залишається кращою мережею для NFT проектів, проте багато хто з них вивчає альтернативні варіанти масштабування. Ми розглянемо ці Рішення нижче:\n\n**1. Сайдчейни EVM та Layer 2:** OpenSea є найбільшим ринком NFT, і, додавши підтримку Polygon PoS, кілька проектів почали створювати спочатку NFT на Polygon. Незважаючи на те, що Polygon пропонує нижчу плату за газ та покращену масштабованість, ліквідність, мабуть, зосередженість на Ethereum робить сайдчейни Layer 2 та EVM непривабливим варіантом для власників проектів.\n\nОдин із можливих способів обійти проблему ліквідності — карбувати NFT на сайдчейні Layer 2 або EVM (через їх низьку витрату газу), а потім вимагати від власників NFT перевести активи в Ethereum (для захоплення ліквідності). Як тільки NFT з'являться в Ethereum, користувачі можуть користуватися ліквідністю, яку пропонує Ethereum.\n\nНезважаючи на те, що існує кілька NFT мостів, схоже, вони не захопили значної частки ринку. Є кілька причин, через які мости NFT не користуються популярністю серед користувачів та власників проектів. По-перше, багато популярних мостів для взаємозамінних токенів у минулому зламувалися, і тому безпека мостів NFT часто ставиться під сумнів. По-друге, оскільки бриджинг залишається за користувачами, ліквідність може стати фрагментованою, оскільки деякі користувачі можуть не використовувати свої активи. Фрагментація ліквідності, що виникає в результаті, насправді може бути більш шкідливою, ніж активи, що залишаються на самому сайдчейні ланцюга.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dr-OWDWK0nJrF1scOHWz-.png?height=788&width=1400)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hn4LzlJYEHJ2D_tZQVRhZ.png?height=781&width=1400)\n\nМи також стверджуємо, що навіть якщо ліквідність покращиться у сайдчен EVM ланцюгах або на рівні 2, масштабованість стане проблемою для проектів NFT, як показано у випадку Arbitrum та Polygon PoS.\n\n**2.** **Альтернативні блокчейни першого рівня.** Декілька альтернативних рівнів 1, зокрема, Solana залучила значний обсяг NFT у своєму ланцюгу і вона неухильно стає життєздатним варіантом для кількох проектів NFT. Фактично найбільший NFT ринок на Solana під назвою Magic Eden має обсяг торгів, дуже близький до обсягу торгів OpenSea на Ethereum.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0xbAP9NHdmTt22Ckhj0RG.png?height=662&width=1179)\n\nНезважаючи на наявність необхідної ліквідності, Solana в минулому щосили намагалася впоратися з великомасштабними подіями карбування NFT.\n\nПодібно до EVM сайдчейнам і блокчейнам другого рівня, блокчейни першого рівня призначені для загального призначення, що означає карбування NFT може зайняти весь блоковий простір, що призведе до перевантаження мережі.\n\n**3. Специфічні блокчейни для додатків.** Як згадувалося вище, деякі NFT та ігрові проекти, які мають ширшу дорожню карту, засновану на утиліті, ніж просто дропа NFT, вивчають рішення для масштабування для конкретних цілей. У даний час існують такі рішення, як Avalanche, суверенні мережі в стилі Cosmos та інші. Однак ці рішення не ідеальні для карбування NFT, які, як правило, не тривають довго і вимагають можливості переходу на базовий ланцюг, такий як Ethereum або Solana, щоб насолодитися ліквідністю.\n\n**4. Механізм відмови від FCFS «першим прийшов – першим обслужений».** Більшість заходів NFT на Ethereum у 2021 році були організовані за принципом «першим прийшов – першим обслужений» (FCFS), коли велика кількість людей намагалися заволодіти обмеженою кількістю NFT. Це призвело до того, що користувачі надіслали велику кількість неуспішних транзакцій. У багатьох випадках відсоток невдалих транзакцій сягав 90% і ці транзакції забивали мережу.\n\n![Джерело: https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/10/a-guide-to-designing-effective-nft-launches ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EholkS-xWHlGxWR1jC8qg.png?height=680&width=902)\n\nУ результаті в деяких проектах було вирішено використовувати дропи, відмінні від FCFS, такі як аукціони та розіграші. Однак скидання без FCFS ще не стали загальногалузевим стандартом через складність, яку ці механізми представляють кінцевим користувачам. Наприклад, аукціон може тривати кілька днів, якщо не тижнів, щоб користувачі мали достатньо часу для участі в торгах, що, у свою чергу, може знизити активність спільноти. Крім того, в порівнянні з FCFS, де користувач, що виграв, повинен відправити тільки одну транзакцію, аукціони часто включають кілька транзакційних ставок.\n\nДалі буде…\n\nПереклад статті AltLayer [ОРИГІНАЛ](https://blog.altlayer.io/nft-minting-made-scalable-part-i-99c892e6557f)\n\nАвтор: Aloid#0803", "timestamp": 1658604562, "digest": "nIcg9w2d3f9fzCcegGoMGzQIxZFDGCaWVTRlOjJLKPs", "contributor": "0x285a2A47Ca8c672820fEF925c484acaE2Bd67335"}

The intention of this article is to take a look at the ETH transfers on Optimism from a network analysis angle.\n\n### Approach and Assumptions\n\nFor this analysis we are going to query data from FlipSideCrypto using their ShroomDK. We’ll be only interested in ETH transfers on Optimism. On Flipside data tables we can find data from 15th of June and we’ll be looking at all the ETH transfers happened on Optimism until 22nd of July. We will be treating ETH transfers as a directed graph as transferring ETH from one account to another indicates a direction. A node will be represented by a wallet/contract address while an edge is represented by a transfer between these nodes, as this is a directed graph ETH that comes into a particular address will be considered as an inward edge and a transfer going out of an address will be considered as an outward edge. Since the main intention of this graph is to find out which wallets are connected we don’t weight the connections based on the number of times they send ETH to each other. Please refer the Appendix for tools, methodology and SQL queries used for this.\n\n### Alright let’s dive in…\n\nThere are 218186 nodes in other words, wallets/contracts transferred within each other during that time period making 489539 connections *(These connections are not number of transfers, if A send B, 100 times and also C send D 1 time both considered as one connect, a connection between A and B in the next scenario a connection between C and D)*. Now, this doesn’t look a lot of connections for the given amount of nodes, which means we have a density of **0.00001028** *(where 1 means all the nodes are connected to all the other nodes while 0 means no connections between any nodes)* and a transitivity of **0.000055** *(This measures the tendency of nodes to cluster together, the higher the value the denser the networks communities internally)* Since we see that transitivity is higher than density we could speculate that when they connect they tend to make smaller, denser communities?.\n\n#### Who are the most connected?\n\nSo, first what is a degree? Well, not the one you are offered by a university, but in our context a degree means how many connections a node has. \n\n![Top most connected users/addresses](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y7ELFVWK6w8EvK2h_25iT.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\nUnsurprisingly we can see Hop protocol has the most number of connections, which means it’s the wallet which most number of wallets have send ETH to (Since 15th of June of course) which makes perfect sense as it’s a bridge that help people **to send ETH** from mainnet or other L2 to Optimism. Out of the labelled wallets we can see most of these top 20 highly connected wallets are dexes or dapps which provide services to the end users.\n\nNow these connections have two directions so let’s look at how many connections these top wallets have in terms of inward and outward directions.    \n\n![Top connected wallets and their in/out connections ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4keNPpuzJPdpLlKbz-rF4.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\nNow we can clearly see that Hop protocol has more number of users who has sent ETH than received ETH from Hop protocol. Interestingly Socket.tech registry has only 9 users that’s connected by outward transactions similar pattern can be seen on Li Fi and couple of unlabelled wallets. \n\n![An empirical cumulative distribution function on degree of connections between nodes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g53lXTjjev7HAmvECYQzO.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\nWe know that this network is not densely connected this shows that 99% of the wallets has 12 or less connections, in other words their are many ‘lonely’ users who have no interactions in terms of ETH transfers with other users, we can see 28.1% has just 1 degree (Has connected with only one other node in the network) those are the ones probably bridged ETH from a bridge like Hop and just HODL?\n\nAlso this shows that the ETH transfers on Optimism is highly active among a small number of users which includes but not limited to dapps, and dexes. \n\n### Connections are great but how influential are these connections?\n\n![Centrality analysis](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dHMcPLwNXg1CBX8n9-5aP.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\nLet’s first understand centrality in simple terms. This is like a rank that a node gets based on the location they are positioned. Degree centrality is based on the number of other nodes it has connected to so, higher degree centrality means it has higher number of connection. However, influence may not just mean having lots of connections but having lots of connections which are also important and influential this is something Eigenvector centrality calculates. *(A person who knows the top politicians in a country would be more influential than someone who has just high school friends)*. \n\nNow in our graph we see most of the highly connected are also highly influential too. However if we take Li Fi or Socket Registry they seems to have very high quality connections as the Eigenvector centrality is quite higher than their degree centrality.\n\n\n---\n\n**Alright, let’s look at some the communities inside this bigger network…**  \n\n## Let’s first enjoy the beauty of few communities..\n\nHere the names represents the most influential nodes in that particular community\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Orange' ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IM1EGov8s1lm5Q3N1fWhR.png?height=1206&width=1476&size=medium)\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Green'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JhxwUvlvghCjte9E29vXO.png?height=1076&width=1566&size=medium)\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Blue'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uROAmN1iWNW76o87HCRXi.png?height=1186&width=1408&size=medium)\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Pink'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OiiIYI_T8YrYeH5leoNkx.png?height=1058&width=1388&size=medium)\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Red'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ktTKJAk4t3cn0T_rvGqtZ.png?height=1076&width=1454&size=medium)\n\nThese were just only 5 rather larger and interesting communities out of 1000s, based on Modularity, *modularity looks for the nodes that are more densely connected together than to the rest of the network*.\n\nInterestingly, we can see some well known labels in all the communities except the green community which also has other interesting structure. Let’s quantify that a bit.\n\n![Communities and their density/transitivity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m1obFLs1NuKKsm_CadNTW.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\n*Note: The size of the marker represents the transitivity*\n\nWe looked at the density and transitivity of the whole network, the communities are we saw in the pictures are densely connected than that of the whole network while Red Community is mostly densely populated among them. As we saw, the Green Community has their own internal sub communities which is evident with the higher transitivity.  Blue community seems to be the Hop protocol’s community and undoubtedly it doesn’t seem to have many other internal communities, the transitivity is even lower than that of the entire network but denser than the main network. Which could mean the users who made transfers with Hop may be a less active crows in terms of connecting with others (Introverts :D). While the green group is actively making connections within them (extroverts :D)   \n\n### How and who the top 5 most influential users in each pool\n\n![Top 5 influential users in each community](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RJ3Cm9U-TAlLVKt589Vhc.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\nThe Green community seems to be a very interesting community, yes it has a high influential ‘figure’ but compared to other communities and also the entire network as a whole the influence is lower, which suggest that compared to the other communities it’s more resilient. Blue community has a very highly influential wallet, Hop protocol, and the pattern is similar across other 4 communities. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ETH transfers on Optimism is an interesting network with lot of beautiful pictures :). However, the network seems to have a very high reliance on a handful of wallets. For example, Hop protocol, Uniswap Router etc. This introduces risks, as a failure or an attack on these points may send some huge ripples across the network. On the other hand we can see some interesting smaller communities being formed inside, some are growing around known entities like 1Inch protocol,  Orbiter etc. The interesting community was the Green Community, which is rather resilient. It will be interesting to know who are they and what are they doing :) \n\nAs a fun thing, you can try out this interactive network which has the top 1000 most important nodes [here in this link](https://networks-nine.vercel.app/op_eth_transfers.html).\n\n### Appendix\n\n1.

Interestingly Socket.tech registry has only 9 users that’s connected by outward transactions similar pattern can be seen on Li Fi and couple of unlabelled wallets. \n\n![An empirical cumulative distribution function on degree of connections between nodes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g53lXTjjev7HAmvECYQzO.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\nWe know that this network is not densely connected this shows that 99% of the wallets has 12 or less connections, in other words their are many ‘lonely’ users who have no interactions in terms of ETH transfers with other users, we can see 28.1% has just 1 degree (Has connected with only one other node in the network) those are the ones probably bridged ETH from a bridge like Hop and just HODL?\n\nAlso this shows that the ETH transfers on Optimism is highly active among a small number of users which includes but not limited to dapps, and dexes. \n\n### Connections are great but how influential are these connections?\n\n![Centrality analysis](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dHMcPLwNXg1CBX8n9-5aP.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\nLet’s first understand centrality in simple terms. This is like a rank that a node gets based on the location they are positioned. Degree centrality is based on the number of other nodes it has connected to so, higher degree centrality means it has higher number of connection. However, influence may not just mean having lots of connections but having lots of connections which are also important and influential this is something Eigenvector centrality calculates. *(A person who knows the top politicians in a country would be more influential than someone who has just high school friends)*. \n\nNow in our graph we see most of the highly connected are also highly influential too. However if we take Li Fi or Socket Registry they seems to have very high quality connections as the Eigenvector centrality is quite higher than their degree centrality.\n\n\n---\n\n**Alright, let’s look at some the communities inside this bigger network…**  \n\n## Let’s first enjoy the beauty of few communities..\n\nHere the names represents the most influential nodes in that particular community\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Orange' ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IM1EGov8s1lm5Q3N1fWhR.png?height=1206&width=1476&size=medium)\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Green'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JhxwUvlvghCjte9E29vXO.png?height=1076&width=1566&size=medium)\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Blue'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uROAmN1iWNW76o87HCRXi.png?height=1186&width=1408&size=medium)\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Pink'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OiiIYI_T8YrYeH5leoNkx.png?height=1058&width=1388&size=medium)\n\n![We'll refer this as the 'Community - Red'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ktTKJAk4t3cn0T_rvGqtZ.png?height=1076&width=1454&size=medium)\n\nThese were just only 5 rather larger and interesting communities out of 1000s, based on Modularity, *modularity looks for the nodes that are more densely connected together than to the rest of the network*.\n\nInterestingly, we can see some well known labels in all the communities except the green community which also has other interesting structure. Let’s quantify that a bit.\n\n![Communities and their density/transitivity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m1obFLs1NuKKsm_CadNTW.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\n*Note: The size of the marker represents the transitivity*\n\nWe looked at the density and transitivity of the whole network, the communities are we saw in the pictures are densely connected than that of the whole network while Red Community is mostly densely populated among them. As we saw, the Green Community has their own internal sub communities which is evident with the higher transitivity.  Blue community seems to be the Hop protocol’s community and undoubtedly it doesn’t seem to have many other internal communities, the transitivity is even lower than that of the entire network but denser than the main network. Which could mean the users who made transfers with Hop may be a less active crows in terms of connecting with others (Introverts :D). While the green group is actively making connections within them (extroverts :D)   \n\n### How and who the top 5 most influential users in each pool\n\n![Top 5 influential users in each community](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RJ3Cm9U-TAlLVKt589Vhc.png?height=525&width=1257&size=large)\n\nThe Green community seems to be a very interesting community, yes it has a high influential ‘figure’ but compared to other communities and also the entire network as a whole the influence is lower, which suggest that compared to the other communities it’s more resilient. Blue community has a very highly influential wallet, Hop protocol, and the pattern is similar across other 4 communities. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ETH transfers on Optimism is an interesting network with lot of beautiful pictures :). However, the network seems to have a very high reliance on a handful of wallets. For example, Hop protocol, Uniswap Router etc. This introduces risks, as a failure or an attack on these points may send some huge ripples across the network. On the other hand we can see some interesting smaller communities being formed inside, some are growing around known entities like 1Inch protocol,  Orbiter etc. The interesting community was the Green Community, which is rather resilient. It will be interesting to know who are they and what are they doing :) \n\nAs a fun thing, you can try out this interactive network which has the top 1000 most important nodes [here in this link](https://networks-nine.vercel.app/op_eth_transfers.html).\n\n### Appendix\n\n1.

Posted on \\*date blocked (seventh post)](https://mirror.xyz/everyoneandnoone.eth/NQfD2bNyeZFEgJ9vrT0hbAmRKlv-BbpZh1HD8gQodjw)**\n\n## Posted on \\*date blocked (eighth post)\n\nNaked in the cramped cottage bedroom, I sit up and take a deep breath of musky air. The bed is wrapped in flower-patterned sheets. The room is vaguely lit by my iPhone charging in the corner. Creeping out of bed, I hear Leah waking up. She turns over onto her back. I feel the floor's wooden grain on my bare feet as I lumber over to my pile of clothes.\n\n\"You're…awake?\" Leah asks, groggily. I pull my pants up. \"Where you going?\"\n\n\"I can't sleep.\"\n\n\"Try praying,\" she says. \"That always…helps me.\"\n\nButtoning down my top, I stare at her peaceful face, her lips slightly parting into a smile.\n\n\"What do you say when you pray,\" I ask her, curious.\n\n\"I say…thank you for this and that, mostly.\"\n\n\"Does he ever say anything back?\" I say, sarcastically, but without malice.\n\n\"Of course he does…in everything…in the sun rising and setting every day, in the people we meet...” Leah closes her eyes and her voice trails off. I disconnect my iPhone and see that it's 3:13am.\n\n\"Okay,\" I say. \"I'll give prayer a try.\"\n\nShe turns over to her side to face me, beaming.\n\n\"Go to sleep, sweetheart,\" I stroke her hair as she drifts off.\n\nIn the living room, the drapes of the large window are pulled wide open, letting in a faint glow from the starlit sky outside. My eyes adjust quickly. I see the outline of the table where two flashlights stand upright. I grab one of them.\n\nThe screen door creaks open, followed by more creaks from the wooden planks on the old porch. I grope my way down the staircase to the dirt ground below, continuing on down the hillside towards the lake. I shine the flashlight on the earth before taking each step, making sure the ground is even there. A wind blows dry dirt and I clench my eyes shut. The night is void of cricket chirps and mosquitoes buzzing in my ears—there is only the relentless rushing of wind.\n\nAs I descend the slope, the sound of waves smacking against wood gets closer. At the foot of the hill, the ground levels out, and I find myself at the mouth of a boat deck floating in the water. Stepping onto the deck, it wobbles and I shift my weight side to side for balance. Ahead of me, the stars reflect off the lake like wavering white dots. I turn off the flashlight and see my own body vanish in the blackness, as if I'm just a pair of eyes hovering over the lake, encompassed by stars above and stars below.\n\nI know that the stars are millions of miles away, its light taking thousands of years to reach my eyes, and I wonder if the actual galactic orbs of gas are even still up there at all—or are they ghosts now—remnants from another time, like the tweets and posts and artwork from people now dead.\n\nTurning back, I step off the unsteady deck onto solid ground, and I sit on a bench a few feet away from the water, resting under the hanging branches of a maple. The bench is like a miniature version of a city park bench, as if it was made for children, and perhaps it was, placed there by Dad decades ago for me. Compelled by the peacefulness, I try, in the darkness, to recall everything I knew before I had erased my childhood from my mind. I struggle to recall the faces of all my grade one classmates from shortest to tallest. Gradually, I remember a time when Dad carried Mom into their bedroom, both of them laughing hysterically, and once again, I come to possess what is already mine.\n\nLooking up at the stars again, I remember Leah telling me to pray, and I begin to search for Leah's God—there in the stars. But I only see the stars—unmoving in the sky for billions of years. So I look beyond the stars—behind them—and see them this time as God's words—written billions of years ago.\n\nIf Leah is right, then the stars, like the mountains and the oceans, are the true scripture of God. Everything is God's words. I think of the generations of men who have come to pass and I imagine the first morning of time when God began writing his message to me—a message traveling through millenniums to reach me here by the lake.\n\nBut what does the message say? What do His words mean? Perhaps the sum total of all stars is simply a single word. Or perhaps the message is not a word, but a single sound that inferred the entire universe. Here, standing alone under the stars, I pray—thankful for his words—this wind, this night sky, these stars, this body of mine.\n\nAnd I thank God for my emptiness—my vast, infinite and glorious emptiness. And suddenly, I feel as if the ground below and the sky above is replacing the prison of my small apartment, and the eternity and vastness of the universe is the new extension of my identity.\n\nAnd with this understanding, this bliss of understanding, I dig out the phone from my pocket and stare down at its lighted screen. My peripheral vision disappears and I only see the whiteness of the screen, almost blindingly, and nothing else. The tiny computer in my hand is a connection to another universe as singular and shared as the one I stood in. A metaverse—a dynamic book of infinite messages, endless identities, and inner dimensions. I tap the wallet icon and I’m asked for my secret recovery phrase. I stare at the twelve empty fields waiting to be filled. Twelve empty fields, like the twelve disciples of Jesus, the twelves sons of Jacob, the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve gates of heaven guarded by twelve angels.\n\nI enter the twelve words William challenged us to remember when we first met. And then I'm in.\n\nMy breath quickens. In the wallet is just a small fraction of Ethereum and all the NFTs I had written and minted without any memory of it.\n\nI open my document app and begin to type on the screen in a trance, as if writing in a vacuum, and the words spill onto the screen like olive oil. Then time skips, and the page is full of words—an hour may have passed, or a minute—it is impossible for me to tell. But it doesn't matter now—it’s over. The story of William is finished. I format the words to fit onto one page and take a screenshot. I connect William’s wallet to OpenSea and mint the final item. William is free now—free to exist forever—free from me.\n\nThe wind blows stronger, and waves slap the deck harder. After taking a deep breath, I light a cigarette, its amber tip glowing brighter as I inhale. Looking up at the cottage, I see a light in the window. Leah must be awake now, waiting for me. But then the light turns off, and the cottage turns into a black outline against the purplish sky. Beside the cottage on the west side is the dense forest that ate my childhood, swallowing it whole and imprisoning it there until yesterday. The forest is now just a forest—just a bunch of trees and a dead birch with a tiny cross nailed to its trunk.\n\nI think I hear something—voices from the cottage. I must be imagining it. A wind plunders through the trees and I curse at the noise, listening for the voices.\n\nI hear it again.\n\nI shake my head. It's late, and I must be hearing things, I convince myself. I clamber up the hillside, the cigarette hanging from my lips. Sucking in a final nervous drag, I drop the cigarette and crush it into the dirt with the heel of my boot. I exhale the sweet nicotine that fails to relax me as it usually does, and make my way back to the cottage.\n\nCreaking across the porch and into the cottage, something feels off.\n\n“Leah?” I switch on the lights and see our bedroom door open. Inside the room the bed is empty, the comforter on the floor. “Leah!” I call out louder. She’s not in the washroom either.\n\nMy mouth seems to dry up when I notice the front door agape, the cabinet door under the sink hanging open, and one of my Dad’s rifles missing from the rack.\n\nA voice screams outside in the distance.\n\nDashing out the front door, I point the flashlight to the west, but the light doesn’t hit anything—it disappears into the darkness between the trees.\n\nI trudge into the darkness to the west. Flustering, I swing the light from tree to tree. All sounds are heightened, like the crushing of foliage at my feet and the rustling leaves above. My fingers tighten around the flashlight and I jerk the light towards every sound. Trekking deeper, thick vines creep around me. Branches from twisted oaks hover like outstretched arms. An owl screeches overhead. Blood rushes between my ears.\n\nAnd then I see it—the dead birch. The wind expands, and the rustle of leaves becomes deafening. My flashlight beam stretches towards the tree and I see a figure standing beside it. At first glance, in the blurring darkness, I'm not sure who it is. Trembling, I drop the flashlight. It thumps on the damp ground, throwing me into darkness. Falling to my knees, I scramble for the light. I find it and raise it again, not daring to blink—it’s Leah, gripping a kerosene jug hanging heavy at her side, her face wet with tears.\n\n\"Hey fam,\" says a voice in the shadows.\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\nThere are only 3 posts remaining.\n\n3 posts that will reveal the truth.\n\nA truth hidden in plain sight.\n\n**[Revealing here.](https://discord.com/invite/MysteryNovelNFT)**", "timestamp": 1658604766, "digest": "wbQiXROXwnzOwCzHNPZDzjtLVncz967PvDycpdcipB0", "contributor": "0xB94FbeEc03C1c33899e2b22F28AaeeCF6026a7cD"}

Карбування NFT – недовговічна подія. Карбування NFT часто закінчується через кілька днів (іноді через години або навіть хвилини), і тільки в цей період активність користувачів надзвичайно висока. Як тільки карбування завершено, активність користувача досить швидко сповільнюється до точки, коли обсяг, що генерується, від вторинної торгівлі або інших дій може бути легко оброблений будь-яким блокчейном.\n\nКрім того, досвід покупки, який випадає первинним та вторинним покупцям, може сильно відрізнятися. Первинним покупцям часто доводиться використовувати механізм білого списку, тоді як вторинні покупці можуть купити NFT на торговому майданчику на свій вибір у будь-який час. Крім того, оскільки вторинні покупці є тими, хто управляє обсягом торгів NFT, важливо переконатися, що їм не нав'язують UX, що радикально відрізняється.\n\n### Flash Layer для карбування NFT\n\nКлючовим нововведенням, яке AltLayer привносить у простір рішень масштабування карбування NFT, є ідея одноразових рівнів виконання. З AltLayer розробник dApp, що очікує збільшення попиту на свій NFT, може: 1) швидко розгорнути швидкий і масштабований накопичувач, захищений першим рівнем; 2) використовувати накопичувач стільки часу, скільки необхідно, і тим самим запобігти засміченню першого рівня, а потім 3) утилізувати накопичувальний пакет, виконавши розрахунок «після закінчення терміну служби» першому рівні. Це робить всю систему найвищою мірою оптимізованою за ресурсами. Рівень виконання та його ресурси викликаються лише тоді, коли dApp очікує значний попит, який не може обробити перший рівень, і як тільки попит знижується, dApp може повернутися до блокчейну першого рівня.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PPjwFlAs2DU3QWPHKngGR.png?height=785&width=1400)\n\n### Ціннісна пропозиція Flash Layer у порівнянні з існуючими рішеннями масштабування NFT\n\nЦіннісну пропозицію Flash Layer для проектів NFT можна резюмувати так:\n\n1. **Рівень масштабування, виділений для карбування NFT:** Flash рівень виділяє рівень виконання, специфічний для карбування, кожного проекту NFT. Оскільки блоковий простір зарезервований для проекту, це означає, що мінт може бути повністю ізольований від будь-якої іншої активності мережі, що не призведе до перевантаження мережі. Проект NFT також зможе зробити процес карбування повністю безгазовим. Ця функція не може бути запропонована на будь-яких сайдчейнах загального призначення Layer 1, Layer 2 або EVM. На додаток до зарезервованого блокового простору для карбування, рівень флеш-пам'яті поставляється з високопродуктивним середовищем виконання, здатним запропонувати виділену пропускну здатність 2000 TPS з низькою затримкою блоку 1-2 с, забезпечуючи безперебійну роботу для карбування. \n2. **Недовговічний по дизайну:** Flash рівень створений спеціально для карбування, оскільки він вбирає недовговічність карбування. Флеш шар видаляється, як тільки подія карбування завершено. Таким чином, учасники події карбування залишаються на флеш шарі протягом найкоротшого часу (тобто тільки під час карбування). Це різко контрастує з рішеннями масштабування NFT для конкретних додатків, які призначені постійного використання. Користувачі флеш-рівня можуть продовжувати користуватися знайомим ним інтерфейсом базового блокчейна, за винятком дуже короткого періоду часу протягом усього життєвого циклу продукту NFT. Це також гарантує, що компонування зі сторонніми програмами dApp, такими як програми для кредитування NFT або гри, не буде порушено. \n3. **Автоматичний розрахунок активів у базовому блокчейні:** коли флеш-рівень, налаштований для карбування NFT, видаляється, система здійснює розрахунок всіх активів у базовому ланцюжку, що в основному означає, що всі NFT потрапляють до базового блокчейну після карбування. На відміну від рішень, які вимагають, щоб користувачі з'єднували активи вручну, автоматичний розрахунок гарантує, що всі NFT будуть переміщені в базовий блокчейн без будь-якого втручання користувача. Уникаючи ручного процесу перетягування NFT, рівні флеш-пам'яті також повністю усувають будь-які ризики безпеки, пов'язані з мостом. \n4. **Нефрагментована ліквідність:** оскільки всі NFT переміщуються до базового блокчейну в кінці процесу карбування, система гарантує нефрагментовану ліквідність у базовому блокчейні. Це гарантує, що учасникам вторинного ринку не доведеться переходити з однієї мережі до іншої, щоб знайти NFT, який вони хочуть купити. \n5. **Знайомий UX для учасників карбування:** оскільки шари flash працюють на тому ж механізмі виконання, що й базовий ланцюжок, користувачі, що беруть участь у заході mint, можуть насолоджуватися простим досвідом. Наприклад, якщо базовим ланцюжком є ​​Ethereum, користувачі можуть використовувати Metamask або гаманці, сумісні з EVM. Вони також можуть використовувати знайомі активи, такі як USDC або ETH для участі у продажу NFT. \n6. **Прозорість для учасників вторинного ринку:** будь-який користувач, який бажає купити NFT на вторинному ринку, не повинен торкатися флеш-шару. Оскільки вторинна торгівля робить значний внесок у загальний обсяг продажів NFT, ця функція гарантує, що вторинні трейдери взагалі не піддаватимуться впливу флеш-шару.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nQQzuGrmLMHDVC4qI_Yi1.png?height=783&width=1400)\n\nУ двох словах, рішення для карбування Flash рівень забезпечує розгортання в один клік, підтримку кількох ланцюгів, нефрагментовану ліквідність та, найголовніше, усунення газової війни.\n\nЯкщо ви працюєте над проектом NFT та плануєте провести захід з карбування NFT, зв'яжіться з нами за адресою [support@altlayer.io](mailto:support@altlayer.io).

Для необізнаних: NFT – це цифрові активи на основі блокчейну, які спроектовані так, щоб бути унікальними а отже, незамінними. NFT зберігають метадані в ланцюгах блоків, які зазвичай пов'язані з файлами, що містять мультимедіа, такі як зображення, відео та аудіо, або токенізоване відтворення фізичних об'єктів, таких як нерухомість. У 2021 році колекціонери NFT відправили на торгові майданчики NFT понад 40 мільярдів доларів. Це число буде лише частиною суми 2022 року, оскільки станом на 1 травня 2022 року сума вже перевищила 37 мільярдів доларів. Згідно з звітом, опублікованим Chainanalysis, з третього кварталу 2020 року кількість активних трейдерів NFT стабільно зростає щокварталу.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KpBh1YozOHXmEs7BInZeO.png?height=516&width=960)\n\nПочаткова хвиля NFT розпочалася з творів мистецтва та предметів колекціонування (наприклад, [рекордний аукціон Beeple за 69 мільйонів доларів](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million)), зображень профілів, цифрових аватарів та ігрових активів, які зробили NFT синонімом 2D-візуального мистецтва. Однак NFT трансформувалися в інші форми, особливо в музику, яка має більше охоплення, ніж образотворче мистецтво.\n\nМузику люблять набагато більше людей, аніж образотворче мистецтво. Музика явно призначена  для всіх через її набагато ширшу доступність. Насправді вважається, що сектор образотворчого мистецтва значною мірою підтримується [приблизно](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/arts/international/new-report-builds-a-profile-of-the-elusive-art-collector.html) 10 000 колекціонерів творів мистецтва, у той час як музична індустрія [отримує дохід](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/16/2298162/28124/en/Global-Music-Recording-Market-Report-2021-2030-Featuring-Universal-Music-Group-Sony-Music-and-Warner-Music.html) у розмірі 57 мільярдів доларів від мільярдів людей з більш ніж [півмільярдом](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/spotify-subscription-numbers-up-youtube-music-tidal/) користувачів платних стрімінгових сервісів.\n\nБільше того, динаміка галузі робить музику ідеальним представником для прориву Web3. Для більшості артистів **Spotify, який є одним із найбільших споживчих продуктів у цьому секторі, став інструментом для популярності, а не для заробітку**. Згідно з звітом Delphi Digital, 10% найкращих артистів [генерують](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/top-1-percent-streaming-1055005/) 99,4% потоків на Spotify. Тепер стрімінгові платформи [наполягають](https://consequence.net/2021/10/spotify-amazon-pandora-apple-streaming-royalty-rates/) на ще нижчих виплатах артистам. Таким чином, NFT пропонують більшій кількості музикантів можливість заробляти на життя своєю роботою, що, як вважається, прискорює прийняття NFT.\n\nРинок NFT неухильно виходить за межі JPEG і MP3, оскільки вони також можуть бути доказом володіння реальними активами. Існує кілька поточних проектів, які використовують NFT для продажу квитків, нерухомості, а також для підтвердження права власності на реальні предмети, такі як годинник та автомобілі.\n\n### Проблеми масштабованості з NFT\n\nЖиття кожного NFT починається із запуску NFT (також іноді званої “карбування” чи “дропа”). Карбування NFT - це коли нова колекція спочатку створюється, продається і розподіляється серед покупців, які потім вирішують залишити її у себе або продати на вторинних ринках. Оскільки NFT часто карбуються в дуже обмеженій кількості, карбування NFT часто створюють газову війну, яка засмічує мережу великою кількістю невдалих транзакцій.\n\nДекілька популярних блокчейнів першого рівня, а також другого рівня не змогли задовольнити потреби масштабування карбування NFT. Нижче наведено кілька реальних інцидентів, пов'язаних із проблемами масштабованості, з якими зіткнулися NFT події на Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Arbitrum та Solana.\n\n### Ethereum\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sy0NVf13nmR576E00-dpy.png?height=706&width=1200)\n\nEthereum є найбільшою екосистемою смарт-контрактів, і високі комісії за газ досить поширені та не є наслідком NFT. Однак дані показують, що NFT приносять більше трафіку в Ethereum, ніж популярні ERC20 та стейблкоїни. З липня 2021 року частка NFT у загальному обсязі переказів до Ethereum перевищила частку стейблкоїнїв та основних токенів ERC-20. У світлі цього не дивно, що популярний проект NFT може створити навантаження Ethereum під час процесу карбування.\n\nЦе було наочно продемонстровано під час продажу NFT, організованого Yuga Labs 1 травня 2022 року на Ethereum. Попит на NFT був настільки високий, що, незважаючи на впровадження внутрішньомережевого процесу KYC та максимальної допустимої кількості карбування у 2 NFT на KYC-гаманець, мережа Ethereum не змогла впоратися з раптовим сплеском попиту. У результаті Yuga Labs попросила співтовариство подумати про перенесення проекту у власну мережу. Нещодавно це було поставлено на голосування і близько 47% користувачів проголосували за APEChain.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rGu_rrZdZCOLpSLWSWviV.png?height=660&width=1202)\n\n### Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum запланував двомісячну маркетингову кампанію під назвою The Arbitrum Odyssey, яка дасть користувачам можливість випробувати різні проекти екосистеми Arbitrum у мережі та в нагороду отримати ексклюзивні NFT.\n\nПо завершенні першого тижня та подачі заявок на [перший NFT](https://galaxy.eco/arbitrum/campaign/GCCNzUtQiW/), транзакції в Arbitrum досягли рекордно високого рівня, внаслідок чого комісія за транзакції в Arbitrum стала вищою, ніж у Ethereum. У результаті лише через тиждень після запуску, команді Arbitrum довелося різко призупинити роботу програми.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-tgnY3Aoz0Wrf4-ht3_x7.png?height=858&width=1214)\n\n### Polygon PoS\n\nНезважаючи на те, що це не обов'язково було подією карбування NFT, “play to earn” гра [Sunflower на початку січня вносила понад 40% комісій за газ](https://www.playtoearn.online/2022/01/10/sunflower-farmers-hits-the-polygon-network-where-it-hurts-gas-fees/) у Polygon PoS. Гра проіснувала недовго, але на піку популярності вона мала близько 500 тисяч користувачів.\n\nТокеноміка гри була розроблена таким чином, що чим більше людей приєднувалося до гри, тим більше збільшувалася загальна пропозиція, а отже, винагороди зменшувалися. Це означало, що хтось, хто грав у перші дні, отримував значно більше винагород, ніж ті, хто приєднався пізніше. Ця схема привела до високої активності, яка атакувала мережу Polygon.\n\n### Solana\n\nМережа Solana була відключена 2 травня 2022 на 7 годин через велику кількість транзакцій, створених NFT ботами.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CE-CM7g5r1IWtfMcTRWNH.png?height=650&width=1200)\n\nОдин з валідаторів Solana навіть запропонував цензурувати транзакції, призначені для контракту Metaplex, щоб пом'якшити проблему, внаслідок чого інші емітенти NFT просили валідаторів не блокувати їх контракти.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bXcNxQDigZLwFK0B3_fAJ.png?height=843&width=1199)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4wgOPlgzHD-esyv3OPyHc.png?height=389&width=1400)\n\n### Існуючі Рішення та їх обмеження\n\nEthereum залишається кращою мережею для NFT проектів, проте багато хто з них вивчає альтернативні варіанти масштабування. Ми розглянемо ці Рішення нижче:\n\n**1. Сайдчейни EVM та Layer 2:** OpenSea є найбільшим ринком NFT, і, додавши підтримку Polygon PoS, кілька проектів почали створювати спочатку NFT на Polygon. Незважаючи на те, що Polygon пропонує нижчу плату за газ та покращену масштабованість, ліквідність, мабуть, зосередженість на Ethereum робить сайдчейни Layer 2 та EVM непривабливим варіантом для власників проектів.\n\nОдин із можливих способів обійти проблему ліквідності — карбувати NFT на сайдчейні Layer 2 або EVM (через їх низьку витрату газу), а потім вимагати від власників NFT перевести активи в Ethereum (для захоплення ліквідності). Як тільки NFT з'являться в Ethereum, користувачі можуть користуватися ліквідністю, яку пропонує Ethereum.\n\nНезважаючи на те, що існує кілька NFT мостів, схоже, вони не захопили значної частки ринку. Є кілька причин, через які мости NFT не користуються популярністю серед користувачів та власників проектів. По-перше, багато популярних мостів для взаємозамінних токенів у минулому зламувалися, і тому безпека мостів NFT часто ставиться під сумнів. По-друге, оскільки бриджинг залишається за користувачами, ліквідність може стати фрагментованою, оскільки деякі користувачі можуть не використовувати свої активи. Фрагментація ліквідності, що виникає в результаті, насправді може бути більш шкідливою, ніж активи, що залишаються на самому сайдчейні ланцюга.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dr-OWDWK0nJrF1scOHWz-.png?height=788&width=1400)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hn4LzlJYEHJ2D_tZQVRhZ.png?height=781&width=1400)\n\nМи також стверджуємо, що навіть якщо ліквідність покращиться у сайдчен EVM ланцюгах або на рівні 2, масштабованість стане проблемою для проектів NFT, як показано у випадку Arbitrum та Polygon PoS.\n\n**2.** **Альтернативні блокчейни першого рівня.** Декілька альтернативних рівнів 1, зокрема, Solana залучила значний обсяг NFT у своєму ланцюгу і вона неухильно стає життєздатним варіантом для кількох проектів NFT. Фактично найбільший NFT ринок на Solana під назвою Magic Eden має обсяг торгів, дуже близький до обсягу торгів OpenSea на Ethereum.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0xbAP9NHdmTt22Ckhj0RG.png?height=662&width=1179)\n\nНезважаючи на наявність необхідної ліквідності, Solana в минулому щосили намагалася впоратися з великомасштабними подіями карбування NFT.\n\nПодібно до EVM сайдчейнам і блокчейнам другого рівня, блокчейни першого рівня призначені для загального призначення, що означає карбування NFT може зайняти весь блоковий простір, що призведе до перевантаження мережі.\n\n**3. Специфічні блокчейни для додатків.** Як згадувалося вище, деякі NFT та ігрові проекти, які мають ширшу дорожню карту, засновану на утиліті, ніж просто дропа NFT, вивчають рішення для масштабування для конкретних цілей. У даний час існують такі рішення, як Avalanche, суверенні мережі в стилі Cosmos та інші. Однак ці рішення не ідеальні для карбування NFT, які, як правило, не тривають довго і вимагають можливості переходу на базовий ланцюг, такий як Ethereum або Solana, щоб насолодитися ліквідністю.\n\n**4. Механізм відмови від FCFS «першим прийшов – першим обслужений».** Більшість заходів NFT на Ethereum у 2021 році були організовані за принципом «першим прийшов – першим обслужений» (FCFS), коли велика кількість людей намагалися заволодіти обмеженою кількістю NFT. Це призвело до того, що користувачі надіслали велику кількість неуспішних транзакцій. У багатьох випадках відсоток невдалих транзакцій сягав 90% і ці транзакції забивали мережу.\n\n![Джерело: https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/10/a-guide-to-designing-effective-nft-launches ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EholkS-xWHlGxWR1jC8qg.png?height=680&width=902)\n\nУ результаті в деяких проектах було вирішено використовувати дропи, відмінні від FCFS, такі як аукціони та розіграші. Однак скидання без FCFS ще не стали загальногалузевим стандартом через складність, яку ці механізми представляють кінцевим користувачам. Наприклад, аукціон може тривати кілька днів, якщо не тижнів, щоб користувачі мали достатньо часу для участі в торгах, що, у свою чергу, може знизити активність спільноти. Крім того, в порівнянні з FCFS, де користувач, що виграв, повинен відправити тільки одну транзакцію, аукціони часто включають кілька транзакційних ставок.\n\nДалі буде…\n\nПереклад статті AltLayer [ОРИГІНАЛ](https://blog.altlayer.io/nft-minting-made-scalable-part-i-99c892e6557f)\n\nАвтор: Aloid#0803", "timestamp": 1658606157, "digest": "DD3_TIphAFsNtAaVNQ7eRKzaca5nKt-3xaVqQNiwiiE", "contributor": "0x285a2A47Ca8c672820fEF925c484acaE2Bd67335"}

The cat figure attracted cat lovers and especially the women-targeted market.\n\nCat lovers, at the current stage, are one of the large groups in the community, who consider less financial returns, but more values of the art that built linkage to the cats as well as the values in the community.\n\nShhan1211 created all Mimic Shans in time for the Web3 era, but Mimic Shans chose a public domain for anyone to use, including those who did not purchase NFT, for more people around the world to use Mimic Shans.\n\nSeveral reasons for success\n\n1. Although  Mimic Shhans black looks a little evil, it is more noble and cute.\n2. There are many people who love cats and keep cats, especially women\n3. The project is online is free mint, not for profit. Make it more like adopting a lost kitten\n4. In different phases online, accumulating more and more users, while more KOL publicity, the project side cooperated with market value management to increase the overall price.\n5. Replacing Mimic Shhans avatar can increase fans, which greatly satisfies the sense of user engagement.  With the appreciation of the price, the army of black cat avatars is increasing.\n6. Make 2 creations to present more possibilities. Even if you don't buy the type you want, by creating on the basis of the original to achieve personal needs\n7. The rare Mimic Shhans has a linkage with BAYC and Azuki. Advance ambush and blue-chip link, better facilitate the publicity.\n\nNFT itself is an ever-changing market, with countless new projects coming online every day. What will happen to Mimic Shhans in the future is unknown.\n\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.\n\n## MetaCreat\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/MetaCreats>\n\nMedium: <https://medium.com/@MetaCreats>\n\nMirror: <https://mirror.xyz/0x2519b80f3c38433a4eB73A5fd0E7bfd122C4D97f>\n\nMirror中文：<https://mirror.xyz/0xe327aeEa2b52fCB1e2498b5B0F08a7F425f1e7A7>", "timestamp": 1658608109, "digest": "icSI3ShdvEjJmb_NfTX1Nfg_1QaHRi-lMurKmBQepBc", "contributor": "0x2519b80f3c38433a4eB73A5fd0E7bfd122C4D97f"}

{"id": "XPCzRHPe4RqRKVK8akKrDfKpe2hl-QRMIYYDi3osEOk", "title": "Psyber-X is Revolutionizing gaming", "body": "\nI enjoy saying this, few hate on it and so I will say it more and much louder!\n\n\nMORE BOLD TITLES IN ALL CAPS!\nThe poster above is an actual Unreal Design the Studio recently released in which I put some Characters and a Title Graphic together. This poster will be minted as a Poster on multiple chains so you may utilize a service like NFTier Print Shop and print your own NFTs.\n\nWe are also looking to open a Hive List store for this purpose & will be reaching out to @thelogicaldude for some direct NFT printing solutions on Hive to compete.\n\nRoyal Reptile Gaming Studios goal is to build Psyber-X as a Triple A game initially launching as a brawler first person shooter battling over LVL token. Once launched Phase II begins and with it the development of the open world rpg complex economy utilizing our land plots in the world that is Psyber-X.\n\nA planned out exciting shooting environment for every gamer, from free to play mobile gamers to pay for play bragging rights, all gamers will find an area to fit in and show off their skills. My Commercial plot I imagine having a city arena built for gang wars where we keep a \"gang server\" and leaderboard scrolling on the top of many of the buildings screens along with the advertisement space I sell. Each floor of the Arena would be another map to battle on for quicker death matches unless we are having a special open map big brawl tournament style gang war... so many ideas\n\nPhase II\nA look at competition\n\nImagine who will turn their land into the city Tombstone or the O.K. Corral? This is Gala Games using unreal yet look at their NFT costs to get in.... we have 10,000 Psybercrates for $20 in Hive or HBD they have a Slinger box for $1,500.00 USD worth of GALA.\n\n\nImagine when GALA goes up again, buy a car or a gunslinger box? you decide... Gala Games is beautiful yet not built to scale or for mass adoption even with so many fans. Strange to see this coin at .05 anyway with a supply of 35,240,112,493 coins minted with an infinite supply to keep printing like the U.S. Government! LVL is 500 million only! Imagine when the Studio is successful with Psyber-X and launches its Studio coin... ROYAL or REPTILE, becomes a scalable competitor of Gala Games... who has a similar marketcap to HIVE\n\nPhase 2 by Bob\nIn phase 2, the MMO aspect will take hold. Players will have the liberty to be an officer working for the peace of the land. They can take up any role of interest ranging from teachers, DJs, or entertainers. Players are also at liberty to rebuild their version of the city but only as overlords. Whoever has the most power will reign supreme. We will dedicate 2 teams to different sides of the project. One team will continue to develop phase 1, and add to it with player's feedback. Team two will start to build out the much bigger vision for PSYBER X. Phase 2 will be the open world MMO cyberpunk game. Development of phase 2 can take upwards of a year, but will be funded by the players who are actively playing on the game platform (phase 1). Phase 2 will take a much larger amount of money and will cost upwards of $500,000-$1,000,000 to complete.\n\nBeyond Phase 2\nAfter phase 2 is completed, we will have 3 teams. Team one and team two will continue to expand on phase 1&2, team three will build out other games that will use LVL as a tool, and further spread the ecosystem. All of these items can happen quicker or slower depending on the amount of popularity and growth Psyber-X receives.\n\nConclusion\nWe believe that very soon, millions will be playing PSYBER X and we will be enabled to build out further into the HIVE and LVL ecosystems. I believe with the help of the community we can make this dream a reality.

We’re specifically interested in how web3 technologies are enabling new thinking and ways of doing, and their potential to combine with existing practices, perspectives, and wisdom.**\n\nThe first conversation we hosted was on [‘meta-governance’](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/yyY2khsoDSgCBaLSIJMeT6xNPJ0c9d2T83rYyt6UfX8). The second was on  [‘DAO2DAO cooperation’](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/ReJ2QiTJh34veQvwLHZJJdMIFDF8Ri9SM6A3dcXRuKk).

While we have attributed some points, our summary misses the nuance provided by the contributors and the depth of overall conversation. As a result, we encourage you to [listen to a recording of the session here](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXxyDedVabJM/).\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\n[@ml_baldwin](https://twitter.com/ml_baldwin) set the scene by referencing that it was Canada Day, and how the meaning of this day was one in flux - moving from the celebration of a colonial legacy to an acknowledgement of a more problematic history and an increasingly diverse and self-aware identity, today. Going into a conversation about ‘new and old’, she emphasised the importance of remembering how nature, earth, and ecosystems create the ultimate, underpinning conditions for the conversation, and how Indigenous ways of knowing have much to contribute.\n\n### Framing governance for better futures?\n\n[@AlexHannant](https://twitter.com/AlexHannant) opened by framing the role of governance in the context of pursuing better futures. The governance we’re used to, and which will continue to be needed, primarily relates to the coordination of authority and accountability in respect to a range of entities, functions, and resources. But we’re facing complex challenges and working with complexity demands dynamic ways of acting. These will require expanded governance mindsets and modalities. For example, how do we retain coherence between diverse actors and groups who are interconnected (maybe interdependent) but also autonomous? How do we negotiate and organise in fluid, systems contexts, be they networks, DAOs, places, or value chains?\n\n*And*, if better futures *are* to be pursued, what are the processes that can help form shared orientations and agreements around what is *‘better’* (while allowing for diverse perspectives and self-determination)? While this may feel abstract, it's a real challenge that we need to find practical ways of navigating. From a functional point of view, the expanded scope of governance in the pursuit of better futures could include:\n\n* Oversight of key operational functions or resources.\n* Enabling representation and decision-making at multiple levels.\n* Stewardship of shared values and principles.\n* Sensing and interpreting the world around us, or at least the systems we are acting within.\n* Negotiation and determining directions.\n* Conflict resolution between interconnected but autonomous actors.\n* Stewardship of shared assets and interests (including data).\n* Managing, mitigating, and adapting to systems-level risks.\n* Fractal-level enablement and consistency - e.g., what happens in micro interactions has fidelity with macro level principles, practices, and missions.\n* Interfacing a plurality of perspectives and self-governing entities.\n* Distribution of rights, responsibilities, and value.\n\nIn respect to the conversation here, how can existing thinking and practices combine with emerging web3 infrastructures to meet these communication, coordination, and coherence challenges? How can we harness ‘new and old’ to enable ‘good governance’ within this expanded and future-facing framing?\n\n[@AlexHannant](https://twitter.com/AlexHannant) then referenced how [B Lab Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand’s new governance system](https://bcorporation.com.au/blog/governing-the-pursuit-of-purpose/) is attempting to grapple with this expanded scope. B Lab AANZ is a small organisation that has to work well within current systems, while fostering a network-based movement of purpose-led businesses, with a higher-level goal for changing the economic system. Rather than have one governance group that attempts to hold these different functions, they have established a governance system that involves different forums to serve the entity, network, and system (and which draws upon a mix of corporate, cooperative, and Indigenous perspectives and practices).\n\nWhile there is no current use of web3 infrastructures, it is easy to see the potential value they could add. This could include: B Corp certification being on-chain, tokens enabling network-based participation, shared data ownership, a ‘soulbound’ token to foster connectivity with other movements and networks, and so on. He also recognised that web3 is not only about technologies. It’s clearly creating spaces for radical thinking, organising, and experimentation. He referenced [Packy McCormick’s view on the potential for web3](https://www.notboring.co/p/web3-use-cases-the-future?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email): *\"\\[it\\] allows for the most rapid iteration on new economic and governance models of any system humans have built.”*\n\nWith this in mind, it may be that the framing of ‘new and old’ is unhelpful. Certainly, there’s nothing inherently oppositional here. This is really about how we bring our full set of capacities to the task of shaping better futures, and combine them in ways that gives us the potential to close the gap between where we are and where we want to go.\n\n[@JayneEngle](https://twitter.com/JayneEngle) started with acknowledging the sense of the possibility being created by web3 and her curiosity in exploring its role in bridging *‘what needs to die in the old world to what is emerging in the new’*. Her context for exploring these horizons spans her roles as: Co-director of [Participatory Canada](https://www.participatorycanada.ca/), a collaborator in the [City Experiment Fund](https://innovation.eurasia.undp.org/city-experiment-fund/) in eastern Europe, and Co-author and editor of *[Sacred Civics: Building Seven Generation Cities](https://www.routledge.com/Sacred-Civics-Building-Seven-Generation-Cities/Engle-Agyeman-Chung-Tiam-Fook/p/book/9781032059112).* Her lens is asking how do we collectively adopt higher orders of responsibilities and thinking about governance to build that which we do not have now. Her bias is towards ‘commoning’ and emphasising the importance of governance arrangements and capacities being able to hold the inevitable tensions in commoning and maintaining a strong sense of mutual responsibility. Her hypothesis for the pursuit of better civic and planetary futures is based on the idea that we are currently not organised for the change that is coming or for change that the world needs. The locus of power and organisation requires fundamental shifts and new institutions that are enabling global commoning, global citizens assemblies, and more decentralised civic and bioregional networks.\n\n[@tinajennen](https://twitter.com/tinajennen) started by sharing her lens on this conversation and her broad experience of governance. This included: learning about her own [Indigenous](https://www.ncai.org/tribal-vawa/get-started/the-sissetonwahpeton-oyate-of-the-lake-traverse-reservation-in-north-and-south-dakota) identity after working with those in Aotearoa New Zealand, sustainable land development through [Antelope Commons](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429503382-26/antelope-commons-building-border-urban-rural-alexander-maller) and [wetland restoration](http://landandwater.com/features/vol40no3/vol40no3_1.html), door to door [canvassing for grassroots organisations](http://hbay.com/associations.php), [a community energy trust](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/tect-restructure-high-court-signs-off-plan-tect-cheques-to-be-phased-out/PTGMCQF4UJG4RRFKUMUWNPVGTA/), bringing [technology](https://www.roboticsplus.co.nz/) to the primary sector, and advisory roles to [Collective intelligence](https://www.collectiveintelligence.co.nz/) - a community organisation that grows leadership in Aotearoa New Zealand), and the [Well-being protocol](https://www.thewellbeingprotocol.org/) - a DAO that is harnessing web3 infrastructures to help communities become more self determining. She emphasised the importance of interfacing ‘new and old’, and is looking for how technologies can be harnessed to develop sustainable communities while *also* bridging knowledge from community organising into the digital space.\n\n### Digital and physical spaces\n\nThe discussion moved to explore the degree that experimentation in DAOs and digital spaces was translating into complex social and physical spaces, where existing institutions and organisations are active and have a range of obligations. Questions came up around how capability and literacy could be developed so a wider range of people could access web3 infrastructures and determine its potential use in their context. Also, how do we find more ways to transition thinking emerging in digital spaces into existing social contexts, and how do we enable more experimentation with web3 in social and physical contexts?\n\nWhile there are many examples of this crossover happening, there are more where web3 is being used for the purpose of extraction and wealth concentration - i.e., the status quo. On the flipside, too many existing governance institutions that hold responsibility for change are resistant to it. New worlds are trying to emerge but much of how the world works is stuck, such as city governments resisting experimentation and keeping expectations low as they struggle to deliver services or the serial collapse of bold, multi-dimensional policy packages like ‘Build Back Better’ in America​​. We need more hybridity that isn’t trapped by the logics of the present day and can act through the lens of being accountable to future generations.\n\nThese changes will require fundamental shifts in mindsets and assumptions. Through the lens of economy, there will need to be movement towards accounting for multiple forms of value (that reflect the attributes of real progress) and universal values. From the ‘old’, Indigenous perspectives can signpost the way through inclusive and regenerative principles. From the ‘new’, web3 infrastructures can *platform* blended and distributed forms of value creation, information exchange, and governance. Refi (regenerative finance) offers a promising example of this potential.\n\n### Moving into new territories\n\nWhile we intuitively know we need new ways of organising and new institutions, it's hard to anticipate what these will look like and how they will work at scale. So we need governance that can help shepherd emergence and serve more network-based and systemic approaches to cooperation. Not everything needs to be tightly coordinated, but there does need to be connectivity, coherence, and constant calibration of interests and conflicts. Awareness, literacy with, and practical application of web3 technologies could help facilitate some of this difficult work.\n\nForming shared values and principles are important in these trajectories because in an increasingly crowded world we can’t avoid interconnectivity and interdependence. The historical evolution of rule by divine right to the rule of law suggests such fundamental shifts are possible, if not linear. In the context of innovation, this means reframing thinking from individual solutions and ventures to something that is far more relational and better recognises the vast potential of harnessing latent multipliers and synergies.\n\n[Amber Craig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambercraig) [@Tahetoka](https://twitter.com/amscraig) joined the conversation to emphasise the importance of safe spaces for Indigenous people and perspectives, and for the need to disrupt the structural bias of resource flows. Her focus has been on growing the Indigenous (Māori) tech community and fostering crowd efforts for systemic change. Her current kaupapa (purpose) is tackling housing inequality by seeking to provide warm, dry, sustainable, and affordable homes for Māori. [Te Whare Hangahanga](https://www.teruaomahara.nz/) is stripping the core issues back to their roots and building fundamentally new models through mātauranga (traditional knowledge) and technological innovation. Amber emphasised how these approaches strive to be sustainable right from the very beginning: *‘we descend from the earth and that’s who we have to give back to because it will sustain us for the rest of our lives and future generations. We need to provide resources and create spaces for Indigenous Peoples to just get stuff done’*.\n\n### Where to start\n\nCommunity and the collective is a critical starting point for this work. There is much good intention in this respect but the logic of how we see and shape the world is dominated by assumptions that have been built up over the last 400 years, and our personal baggage. Part of the reorientation process is to make the implicit more explicit. For example, boards would benefit from declaring their individual and collective assumptions and worldviews before from the outset.\n\nOne of the challenges of scaling in web3 is that we often don’t know the people we are communicating with while relying on mechanical processes. Also, we may not be getting enough diversity. This is important because diverse teams are better equipped to make sense of complexity and resist groupthink. The [Well-being protocol](https://www.thewellbeingprotocol.org/) is intentionally being incubated by a diverse group with both some challenging and promising results, but how do we foster this type of diversity in innovation and governance across global networks?\n\nIn response to this question, notions of [Citizens Assemblies](https://citizensassemblies.org/) provide a model. This can include global institutions that involve 100 randomly selected people from around the world, who are invited to engage with their local communities and then contribute a voice on shared issues, like climate action. DAOs could provide the organisational platform for these types of approaches. How would we think about designing DAOs to facilitate global citizens assemblies? How could we think about generating collective intelligence with the aid of technology to inform deliberation? Whatever we build needs to consider scale and also find bridges between different levels of scale.\n\n### DAOs as bridges between new and old?\n\nThis turned the conversation to asking what DAOs actually represent. We can see them as novel and/or additional organisational forms, *and also* as an enabler of *organising* - [a more fluid arrangement that is able to respond to the requirements of next-horizon cooperation](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/3-ESNDLcf44dZ6VteaqZSpQuTL0oouSxlLJwuAlcQ_s). The framing around these ideas is hard because it’s still forming; we’re having to build novel ways of understanding, interacting, and communicating as we go.\n\n[@Lewwwk](https://twitter.com/Lewwwk)[ ](https://twitter.com/yeoro)joined the conversation and raised the potential trap around seeing DAOs as a formula and wanting to see DAOs *doing* something. It can be more helpful to think about them as the primitives or tools that are coming available to enable experimentation with new forms of weaving across systems and networks. Experiments with how we bring people together in ways that are sometimes ephemeral, sometimes durable, and sometimes around shared resources. They are enabling us to be more flexible and iterative than we’ve been before with existing governance systems.\n\nOn the notion of *organising* versus organisations, to what extent can DAOs enable diverse actors to organise around shared missions? How can this interface with non-DAO actors? Or is this a false dichotomy…? The decoupling of agendas may come from the pace of change in legacy institutions not aligning with people active in the web3 space who are looking for accelerated movement. While there is a clear need to work towards better futures, we also need to avoid slippage into utopian spaces that exist outside the reality of cities and settlements. We need to integrate new technologies with existing social capabilities and physical contexts in ways that are transformative.\n\nThe conversation closed with a sense that splitting the worlds of new and old is not helpful. People active in DAOs are not categorically different to those who haven’t yet developed an affinity with web3. It’s, perhaps, more helpful to see this time as transitional, not divergent. That said, if web3 plays out to its potential, we will need many more people engaged in how the technologies can unlock new possibilities and bigger shifts in cooperation.\n\n## A reflection on all three conversations\n\nWe’re not currently organised for the change we need. Better futures will demand more fluid cooperation and more people participating in decentralised yet coherent action towards shared missions.\n\nIn the three conversations we explored how:\n\n1. Metagovernance offers a framing to recognise systems interdependence and a field in which to develop practical governance approaches for those contexts, and which can layer onto higher-level purposes and orientations.\n2. The dynamics of DAO to DAO interactions are incredibly diverse, fluid, and emergent.\n3. web3 infrastructures provide the potential to enable radically different ways of organising, acting, and governing, but creating communities decoupled from the social and physical contexts we inhabit will stymie this potential.\n\nMore than anything we reaffirmed what we already had a sense of - that we need much more values-based and purpose-led experimentation with web3 infrastructures. DAOs and DAO primitives provide flexible and dynamic spaces and platforms for doing this, and diversity will enhance innovation.\n\nCritically, experimentation needs to go hand-in-hand with social capital and a transfer of power (and resources) that enable more people to think and act differently.\n\nIt will also be useful to think about different time horizons and levels of scale - what is available now vs. what needs to be worked towards, and what needs to be present at the level of experimentation to indicate that novel approaches have potential for scale (acknowledging that scaling can play out in a number of ways).\n\nAcross these experiments we need deeper and clearer thinking about the role and arrangements for governance. Furthermore, we should recognise that governance is an emotional capacity, and a mindset, as well as a set of functions.\n\n## You may also be interested in…\n\nSome other thinking on governance being undertaken by @SuperBenefitDAO:\n\n* [DAOs aren't things... they are flows.](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/3-ESNDLcf44dZ6VteaqZSpQuTL0oouSxlLJwuAlcQ_s)\n* [Scale and the levers that provide DAOs their power](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/unisNGUtHyRF7Zcp9CBbC-VhICOvVm0uzTFJUPX-Icg).\n* [DAOs: From fractal primitives to network scale.](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/zyP-6GZQz-DWcdbAa-4sqRiY58P1WvYvIs_2zNa9oYo)\n* [Summary of Conversation #1 ‘Metagovernance’.](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/yyY2khsoDSgCBaLSIJMeT6xNPJ0c9d2T83rYyt6UfX8).\n* [Summary of Conversation #2 ‘DAO2DAO cooperation’.](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/ReJ2QiTJh34veQvwLHZJJdMIFDF8Ri9SM6A3dcXRuKk)\n\n**Summary produced by:** [@AlexHannant](https://twitter.com/AlexHannant) and [@TarynLucas6](https://twitter.com/TarynLucas6)\n\n**Image attribution:** [Coloured reflections, Tony Hisgett](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27593845)", "timestamp": 1658611577, "digest": "rcWTJ4C9elHzJ0cUrIWgSVs20nJVkTdS7EHI8VqCRlw", "contributor": "0x51fFe31d967D89b6aB6CBBaaBb02bCf4300699cd"}

If you invest on a multi-year time horizon, you’ll weather multiple cycles. So you benefit most from focusing on entry points, accumulating when valuations are attractive, and listening to the data.\n\nWhat’s the data saying?\n\n## On Chain Indicators\n\nIn the last month, [MVRV](https://medium.com/@kenoshaking/bitcoin-market-value-to-realized-value-mvrv-ratio-3ebc914dbaee), a ratio of current BTC market cap relative to cost basis, bottomed [at 0.94](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&category=&m=market.Mvrv) and currently rests just above 1. During the March 2020 drawdown MVRV fell to 0.85 and dipped as low as 0.7 in December 2018. A further 9% or 25% drawdown would send MVRV back to those levels. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zqMwq8WPBQlJ-pEEhLF4x.png?height=750&width=1520)\n\nUnlike MVRV, which measures the value of held coins relative to cost basis, SOPR measures the value of spent coins relative to cost. \n\nPeriods when long term holder MVRV and SOPR dip below 1 have been a [reliable bottom signal](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-28-2022/) in past bear cycles. \n\n> For a bear market to reach an ultimate floor, the share of coins held at a loss should transfer primarily to those who are the least sensitive to price, and with the highest conviction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y6-7YpvDdsqOTmYgZt33f.png?height=922&width=1600)\n\n> Overall, the fingerprint of a widespread capitulation, and extreme financial stress is certainly in place. However, there may still be a combination of both time pain (duration), and perhaps further downside risk to fully test investor resolve, and enable the market to establish a resilient bottom.\n\nExchanges also saw [major outflows](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2022/), which likely reflected a self custody response to fears of further [3AC contagion](https://bmpro.substack.com/p/contagion-report-2022). But a corresponding increase in wallets with little to no spending history suggests these coins made their way to long term hodlers who tend to be “least sensitive to price and have the highest conviction”. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K69_kmiVr4-jGoXruGDFM.png?height=751&width=1271)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4oVCz5JU1zm8Wupa5H3uL.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n## MACRO \n\nGiven the high but [decreasing correlation](https://twitter.com/dan_pantera/status/1547628104968900611) between crypto market cap and the S&P, we need to continue carefully considering macro headwinds and the possibility of another 20-30%+ downside in equity markets which could “fully test investor resolve.” \n\nOn the macro front, we’ve already seen major [multiple compression](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/stockmktperatio.pdf) which aligns the forward P/E ratio with its historical average.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gkXMmDAp5Hyt9amcufAKt.png?height=535&width=1296)\n\nHowever, analysts tend to underestimate the impact of a recession on earnings so we could see prices dip further as earnings expectations dim. For example, [JP Morgan ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-29/wall-street-s-rosy-profit-view-is-starting-to-fade-tech-watch)recently [lowered earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3852955-jp-morgan-latest-to-slash-estimates-as-online-advertising-weakens) estimates on 26 internet companies.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LjLnT87HjvdTMedUqM08k.png?height=896&width=1300)\n\nThe bond market is also flashing [warning signs](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/05/bonds-flash-recession-warning-light-as-key-part-of-the-yield-curve-inverts-again.html). An inverted [yield curve](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/10Y2YS), which happens when the 10 year treasury yield dips below the 2 year, often precedes a recession. It inverted in April when some experts such as Ellen Zentner, Chief Economist at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/inverted-yield-curve-recession-outlook), argued:\n\n> when we look at factors in the economy that are typically signals of a recession, such as job growth, retail sales, real disposable income and industrial production, we don’t see an approaching recession.\n\nBut it just inverted again and while the [US added 372k jobs in June](https://www.wsj.com/articles/june-jobs-report-unemployment-rate-economy-growth-2022-11657237512) (exceeding expectations) and U.S. [industrial production](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-industrial-production-eased-in-may-adding-to-signs-of-economic-slowdown-11655480082) grew in May albeit at a slower pace than April (0.2% vs 1.4%), retail sales and real disposable incomes are down since April’s inversion: \n\nRetail sales [rose 1%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/retail-sales-june-rose-consumers-inflation-11657833254) in June and fell less in May than initially believed. But real (inflation adjusted) retail sales have been flat for over a year. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eJuyarXvn3R1jSp_ZNQK0.png?height=644&width=898)\n\nInflation-adjusted per capita disposable income [fell to $45,490](https://www.axios.com/2022/07/01/disposable-income-dropping-democrats-midterms) in May, down 3.6% yoy and down 20% since March 2021 when stimulus checks buoyed incomes to [record highs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DSPIC96).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LtaPJnugalpNcA3c1zBeU.png?height=411&width=786)\n\nThe 10 year breakeven inflation rate and the 5 year, 5 year forward inflation expectation rate are both in the vicinity of the Fed’s target (2%) suggesting many believe they will bring inflation under control. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CWMNjraKrnG0fVfTfTGI8.png?height=354&width=1114)\n\n[Alliance Bernstein](https://www.alliancebernstein.com/corporate/en/insights/investment-insights/inflation-higher-but-not-forever.html) also makes a case for a return to 2% inflation, a case which rests on the belief, “while we lack visibility on the supply side of the global economy, developments on the demand side are coming into clearer view.”\n\n[Lyn Alden](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4519393-demand-destruction-inflation-global-energy-situation) isn’t convinced. She first explains why this cycle is different than the 1980’s: \n\n> When Paul Volcker famously raised rates to 19% in 1980 to slow down money supply growth, total debt (public and private combined) was 160% of US GDP. Today, total debt is 370% of GDP. So, a much lower interest rate would cause widespread insolvencies and economic contraction.\n>\n> In 1980, the money supply growth was mainly coming from commercial bank lending, and price inflation was mostly a demographics-driven demand issue rather than a supply issue. Tightening monetary policy was effective at reducing bank lending, and thus effective at reducing money supply growth.\n>\n> Today, the money supply growth mainly came from fiscal spending, and price inflation is more-so a supply-scarcity issue rather than due to particularly strong demand.\n\nMessari analyst [Tom Dunleavy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9sx5yy1uhfu80f0/Analyst%20Notes_%20Why%20we%20still%20have%20much%20further%20down%20to%20go%20in%20%28mostly%29%20charts%20_%20Messari%200722.pdf?dl=0), using [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=headline+figure%3Bpce) data, shows how supply and demand side factors are contributing to inflation, unlike the 1980’s when inflation was primarily caused by excess demand that could be tempered by Fed policy. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xwQ4PILzE2gF25jhkLIWv.png?height=585&width=851)\n\nLyn explains why she isn’t convinced tempering demand will be enough to tame inflation: \n\n> The two biggest countries \\[US and China\\] are actively contributing excess oil supply to the market and/or destroying oil demand, and yet oil is at $110/barrel. If inflation is reduced by reducing global energy usage over the next year (a.k.a. severe recession), while the supply-side problems remain mostly unaddressed, then inflation would be ready to return as soon as demand destruction ceases. \\[…\\] \n>\n> **Destroying demand in the face of supply constraints is like running away and hiding from a monster in a closet, so the monster just sits outside and waits for you to come out again. Until the monster is actually dealt with, it’s still there, waiting.**\n\nWe could soon find ourselves in a situation where the Fed, through a combination of rate increases and quantitative tightening, slows the economy and reduces demand-driven causes of inflation.\n\nBut given we are in the late phase of a debt cycle, the Fed will reach a point sooner than in prior cases of high inflation where it has to back off unless it’s willing to face widespread insolvencies and economic contraction.\n\nHorizon Kinetics [and others](https://horizonkinetics.com/products/etf/infl/#overview) believe inflation is [here to stay](https://horizonkinetics.com/app/uploads/Interim-Q1-Q2-Commentary-2022-with-TPL-addendum_FINAL.pdf). The Fed won’t be able to raise rates enough to bring inflation under control given the magnitude of today’s debt levels, and the last time they tried reducing the money supply was during the Great Depression.\n\nSo it seems like there are at least three possible futures:\n\n1/ modest rate hikes and QT will be enough to tame inflation\n\n2/ the fed is too aggressive and the US is forced to spend over 25% of a shrinking economy servicing debt\n\n3/ the fed will be aggressive but soon realize its inflation target is unattainable without cratering the economy\n\nA recent [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-04/fed-pivot-in-september-floated-as-possible-stock-market-savior) highlights three sources who believe the third scenario is most likely.\n\n[Chris Weston](https://www.thearmchairtrader.com/technical-analysis-its-all-about-growth/), head of research at Pepperstone Group:\n\n> the 21 September FOMC meeting could see a major direction change from the Fed.
