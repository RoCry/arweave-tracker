{"id": "FesQKK-3j-_UQGqgEcemlE_NlO9MnKq_cnVXsCz0vkI", "title": "Horizontal liquidity: how value crosses the chain", "body": "The essence of liquidity is value exchange. In recent years, the market share of ethereum has been gradually declining and more and more alt-blockchains are widely used. When a new public chain/L2 ecology is formed, users create the need to migrate assets from the original ecology to the new one, as well as to transfer information across chains. I refer to these cross-chain behaviors as horizontal liquidity.\n\nThe need for horizontal liquidity arises when people want to be able to do things between different blockchains that could otherwise be done in the same blockchain. What prevents people from doing so then is the impediment of horizontal liquidity. The value of blockchains lies in their tamper-proof, trustless nature, and these come from a decentralized consensus that makes every transaction trustworthy, thus eliminating deception. And the core of cross-chain lies in the consensus that can be reached and transmitted (even for atomic exchange, it needs to verify the credentials for single point consensus of both parties), which is the basic value of blockchain embodied.\n\nConsensus building and delivery requires that one blockchain be able to reliably access the state of another blockchain. Since each blockchain has its own rules, governance mechanisms, native assets, and data formats, information transfer and asset migration between blockchains is not naturally accessible. Therefore, we need a system to support the transfer of values between two or more blockchains that include assets, contract calls, proofs, or state information.\n\nThis system, which we often call a \"bridge\", relies on the following components to enable state access between blockchains:\n\n1. State monitoring. There is usually a role, such as \"Oracle\", \"Validator\" or \"Relayer\", which is responsible for monitoring the state on the original chain.\n2. Message passing/forwarding. After this role receives an event, it needs to transfer the message from the original chain to the destination chain.\n3. Consensus building. In some models, a consensus is needed between the roles monitoring the original chain in order to pass that information to the destination chain.\n4. Message signature. The actors need to cryptographically sign the message sent to the destination chain, either individually or as part of a threshold signature scheme.\n\nIt can be learned that the reliability of cross-chain migration depends entirely on how the above links work together. They need a verifier to ensure that there are no problems in each link, and the choice of this verifier is the main difference in the way the bridge works: some bridges use trusted systems, others use trustless systems.\n\n# Trusted Bridge\n\nSuch a bridge requires users to trust a third-party institution and allow the third-party institution to hold their funds. The most common type of bridge is that of a centralized exchange, such as the Binance Bridge.\n\nThe advantages of this type of bridge are obvious:\n\n1. Easy to use.\n2. Low cost. Most exchanges only charge a gasoline fee for simple conversions, no on-chain calculations.\n\nBut they also have more obvious disadvantages:\n\n1. No control. In the process of value transfer, users must give up control of their assets.\n2. Limited functionality. Mainly in two aspects, firstly, such bridges are only used to transfer assets and cannot be used for contract calls, proofs or state information transfer, and secondly, they can only be used to transfer CEX listed tokens.\n3. Licensing and trust risk. Users need KYC to use such bridges and need to fully trust the bridge developer and risk that the developer may disconnect the asset bridge at any time, such as [Binance suspends dogecoin withdrawals](https://member.fintech.global/2021/11/12/binance-suspends-dogecoin-withdrawals/#:\\~:text=Crypto%20currency%20exchange%20Binance%20has,version%20update%20on%20November%2011.).\n\n# Trustless Bridge\n\nIt's all about trust. De-trusting means that users don't have to worry about their assets being controlled by third parties, and it also means that such bridges can become public goods.\n\nSo what is trustless? John Adler and Mikerah Quintyne-Collins explain in their [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06441.pdf) that \"*a blockchain system is trustless if and only if its state (all its state elements) is both valid and secure.*\"\n\nThere are several key words here, state, valid and secure.\n\n1. State. This can be understood as \"who\" has \"what\" at \"any time\", which is recorded by the blockchain.\n2. Valid. This means that the user is able to change the status of the funds for a limited period of time.\n3. Secure. This means that the user's funds cannot be stolen and frozen forever, and only the owner can change the status of the funds.\n\nIt is important to note that trustless does not mean no trust at all, but rather minimizing trust, which is also true for any public chain. A completely message-free cross-chain transaction would be for Alice on blockchain A to send 1000 USDC directly to her wallet address on blockchain B. Alice's wallet address on blockchain B would then receive it directly, just as in the real world I would put money from one wallet into another. This process is completely trustless because there is no third party involved, but this is impossible because different blockchains cannot directly access and modify each other's state directly.\n\nThus, [trust is a spectrum](https://blog.li.fi/li-fi-with-bridges-trust-is-a-spectrum-354cd5a1a6d8), and the degree of trust is different for different mechanisms. If the trust cost of the above example with no trust at all is 0, then the trust cost of a trusted bridge is 1. The trust cost of a trustless bridge is between 0 and 1, mathematically expressed as (0, 1).\n\nWhen it comes to trustless bridges, the first question we need to figure out is, \"[Who is the verifier of the system?](https://blog.connext.network/the-interoperability-trilemma-657c2cf69f17)\", [different design mechanisms](https://blog.li.fi/what-are-blockchain-bridges-and-how-can-we-classify-them-560dc6ec05fa) give different answers.\n\n1. External verification. External validators are not part of any of the related blockchains and are introduced by bridges with their own unique trust assumptions. Dependent on external validators or federations, security depends on the security of the external validator/federations and different collateral mechanisms (described in detail below), such as Thorchain, Anyswap, Biconomy, Celer, Synapse, PolyNetwork, etc.\n2. Optimistic verification. Optimistic verification relies on external verifiers, but by using honest observers to monitor operations and report fraud as verification. Its security depends on the optimistic mechanism, and since the attacker does not know at the time of the attack whether the fraud will be detected or not, this makes it impossible for the attacker to ever be sure that he will be able to successfully steal the funds, thus greatly increasing the economic cost of attacking the system, e.g. Nomad.\n3. Local verification. The two verifiers underlying the relevant blockchain verify each other. Relying on liquidity networks, the atomic exchange process can effectively make it impossible for the validators on each chain to collude and steal funds, however liquidity networks lack cross-chain messaging capabilities and can rely on optimistic or external validation bridges to enhance the functionality of the bridge, thus reducing security, such as Connext, Hop and other atomic exchange systems.\n4. Native verification. All validators at the bottom of the relevant blockchain are responsible for validating the system. Some native validation relies on light clients and relayers, where relayers are handled by oracle or node relayers, where the relayer transmits information from the source chain to the light client of the target chain, and the native validation node will verify the correctness of the information and trigger the corresponding smart contract, so the security depends on the relayer, such as Stargate, Cosmos IBC, Near RainbowBridge, etc.; Some native validation relies on ZKP and security depends on the relevant blockchain, such as Starkgate and other aggregation bridges.\n\n![Bridge's trust spectrum Source: Li.Fi](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h3a7w545irj20v90fn0ul.jpg)\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that in terms of the degree of trustless, native verification > local verification > optimistic verification > external verification.\n\n## Native vs. Local verification\n\nNative and local verification are originally trustless to the same extent due to their reliance on the relevant blockchain's own verifier. However, native validation cannot support generic data transfer between chains due to the use of atomic exchanges, so some other trust assumptions are often introduced to support more functionality, e.g. Hop is native validation but introduces a fast arbitrary message bridge (AMB) to enable fast bridging of optimistic aggregated funds. The protocol even relies on an externally validated bridge if no AMB exists for a given target chain. Thus, the degree of trustless: native authentication > local authentication.\n\nAtomic exchange is characterized by implementing exchange operations inside a state update, typically including hash time locks and conditional transfers, etc.\n\n> **Atomic exchange across layers:** The naturally connected nature of the first layer across to the second layer allows them to easily perform conditional transfers since they are bookkeeping under the same set of books. Conditional transfers, where the first segment of an operation is triggered by the second segment, are an atomic exchange that is more straightforward than hash locks (HTLCs).\n> There is also a second interlayer spanning between layers. Some people will look at second layer spanning as distinct from cross-chaining, when in fact they have very few differences. The only difference between Layer 2 cross-layers and cross-chains is that they are previously connected through the Layer 1 network, which allows them to communicate through conditional transfers. However, this approach is simply too expensive, requiring each cross-layer to go through the first layer network, and suffers from slow speeds and congestion. As a result, layer 2 cross-layers are often viewed as different blockchains that are not connected.\n\n## Optimistic vs. External verification\n\nOptimistic verification and external verification both essentially have a set of third-party (non-related blockchain) nodes for verification. Beyond the many differences in technical details, the core difference lies in their cryptographic economics.\n\n* External verification (i.e., multi-signature, verifier, PoS, MPC, or threshold signature) cross-chain bridges utilize the honest majority assumption.\n* Optimistic verification uses the observer + fraud proof model, i.e. the verifier assumption of an honest person.\n\nTherefore, from a trustless perspective, optimistic verification requires significantly lower trust costs than external verification.\n\nIn contrast, among external validation, there are two main economic models.\n\n* Bonded: After malicious activity occurs, node collateral is forfeited, but the system does not guarantee to compensate users for losses, e.g. [Polygon PoS Bridge](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started/).\n* Insured: After malicious activity occurs, the node collateral is reduced, and the reduced collateral is used to compensate for the user's loss, e.g. [Axelar](https://axelar.network/).\n\nFrom this perspective, an insured external verification bridge can relatively minimize the level of trust.\n\n# Performance of trustless bridges\n\nDifferent authentication mechanisms also bring different security, speed, connectivity, capital efficiency, and statefulness correlations, which are commonly used [to evaluate bridge design](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/blockchain-bridges-5db6afac44f8).\n\n* Security: trust and validity assumptions, tolerance of malicious actors, security and inversity of user funds.\n* Speed: delay in completing transactions, and assurance of finality. There is often a trade-off between speed and security.\n* Connectivity: The choice of target chains for users and developers, and the different levels of difficulty in integrating additional target chains. Good connectivity means a high degree of compatibility with public chains and not easily limited by differences in consensus algorithms and data structures of different public chains.\n* Capital efficiency: The economics around the capital required to secure the system and the transaction costs of transferring assets.\n* Statefulness: The ability to transfer specific assets, more complex states, and/or perform cross-chain contract calls.\n\nDifferent validation approaches have different trade-offs, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Although there are some drawbacks to simply adding up the dimensions and calculating the total score for comparison, it seems that, as a rough guide, the total score ZKP > Light Clients & Relayers > Liquidity Networks = Optimistic > External Validators & Federations.\n\n![Performance of bridges with different authentication mechanisms](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h3a7wgi6akj21150i6aby.jpg)\n\nExternal validations excel in terms of statefulness and connectivity because they can trigger transactions, store data and allow interaction with that data on any number of target chains. Usually such third-party nodes require pledge mechanisms for security, so the capital efficiency of such bridges is minimal. In terms of security, since there are many types of externally verified bridges and different externally verified federations have different consensus algorithm security, their security cannot be generalized, but due to trust assumptions and third-party mechanisms, once the bridge is breached, the user may lose all their money and it will ripple through all the applications associated with the bridge, and their security is the lowest overall.\n\nOptimistic verification, which performs well in terms of statefulness and connectivity, is justified in the same way as external verification. However, due to the mechanism of optimistic verification, it is more capital efficient than external verification but less than bridge designs that do not require the guarantee of a cryptographic economic mechanism. Its speed is also the lowest due to the verification window period. In terms of security, the cost of attacking an Optimistic cross-chain bridge with `n` verifiers is equal to the cost of compromising or hacking `n` verifiers. And relative to external verification, the cost of an attack with `n` verifiers for an external verification cross-chain bridge is equal to the cost of compromising or hacking `m` verifiers, where `m` < `n` . In addition, with optimistic verification, even if `n` verifiers are hacked the attacker is not guaranteed to steal the funds, as long as an honest observer \"catches the fraud\" and revokes the attacker's access to the funds. Therefore, optimistic verification is generally more secure than external verifiers, but less secure than local verification and native verification mechanisms, where an attacker cannot steal funds at all.\n\nLocal validation (liquidity networks) excel in security and speed because the atomic exchange mechanism using hash time locks makes it impossible for funds to be stolen, and local validation without the need for universal consensus greatly increases speed. They are also more capital efficient than bonded/insured external verifiers, as capital efficiency is related to transaction flow/volume rather than security. However, because locally validated systems cannot support common data transfer between chains, their statefulness is poor, which leads to the fact that they often need to introduce other technical support to achieve more functionality, such as Hop's introduction of the Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB) and Connext's cooperation with Nomad.\n\nNative authentication performs very well in terms of security, capital efficiency and statefulness because it relies on the underlying trust and/or consensus mechanism of the domain to operate, and the blockhead relay system can pass any type of data without any pledge. Likewise, it must be customized for each type of domain. The Ethereum ecosystem is highly heterogeneous: ZK/optimistic aggregation, sidechains, and base chains running a large number of consensus algorithms such as ETH-PoW, Nakamoto-PoW, Tendermint-PoS, Snowball-PoS, PoA, and many others. Each of these areas requires a unique strategy to implement a natively verified interoperability system. In terms of connectivity, a native verification system using ZKP is a bit worse, since not every consensus model can be proven with zero knowledge. In terms of speed, ZKP cross-chain bridges have good low-latency properties and are also likely to be much cheaper than conventional blockhead relay systems because proving consensus does not need to happen on the chain.\n\n> In addition, LayerZero belongs to native authentication, and its innovation, even if small, is very important, introducing a prophecy machine to enable on-demand streaming of blockheads (instead of keeping all blockheads and reducing costs) and guaranteeing security due to the addition of an independent relay system on top of the prophecy machine.\n\n## Statefulness: Universal Messaging\n\nUniversal messaging is the ability to call any contract on different blockchains. So why does the cross-chain approach of locally validated networks not support generic messaging?\n\nIt is actually possible for a locally validated system to implement cross-domain contract calls, but only if the function being called has some form of logical owner. For example, it is possible to trustlessly call Uniswap's swap function across chains, since anyone with an exchangeable token can call the swap function. However, it is not possible to trustlessly lock and mint NFTs across chains in local validation - this is because the logical owner of the `mint` function on the destination chain should be the `lock` contract on the source chain.\n\nIntuitively, locally validated messages are sent from one contract on the chain to the same contract on another chain for function invocation through a single point of mutual validation, completing the transaction and state change within an atomic exchange process, and thus there is a logical problem of invocation; while messages of other validation methods pass the changed (fast) state through multiple points of validation, and there is no logical problem of invocation.\n\n## Connectivity: State Verification and Consensus Reaching\n\nAs already talked about, it is due to the different consensus algorithms of the different chains that break connectivity. How is this understood?\n\nTake the example of a transfer. Briefly, when a transfer occurs, a credential is generated at this point, and another chain learns that this is true than the transfer by verifying the change of credentials before it can initiate the next action. The process of generating this credential is the process of consensus algorithm, and the other chain needs to understand the credential (e.g., verify the hash) to simulate the way the credential is generated, and this is where different consensus algorithms can get in the way. At this point, the logic of ZKP is slightly different again, although the same generation algorithm can be used for ZKP, some of the consensus models are difficult to prove by zero knowledge.\n\n# A little reflection on horizontal mobility\n\nHorizontal liquidity refers to interoperability across chains to support messaging and asset transfer. Currently, there is no solution to the [trilemma](https://blog.connext.network/the-interoperability-trilemma-657c2cf69f17) of horizontal liquidity: trustless, scalability and generalizable. The NXTP proposed by Connext tries to build an interoperable network \"layer 2\" to solve this problem, based on the idea of the second layer of Ethereum, but I think the effectiveness of this solution remains to be examined.\n\nIn the scalability trilemma of Ethereum, it is verification that plays the role of a mortise and tenon structural connector, so it can be developed as a modular blockchain by breaking it down with verification as the mortise and tenon into executing (computation to verify), (verification result to build) consensus and data availability (to verify).\n\nRecently there have been voices talking about modular cross-chain bridges, which try to combine different cross-chain solutions and encapsulate them with the same interface, but this does not change the nature of the logic running under the package, and the problems that should exist remain. We need to find the mortise and tenon structure in the cross-chain problem to be able to disassemble a complex problem cleanly without breaking the original parts. Verification as a cross-chain mortise and tenon structure works because cross-chain is essentially cross-ledger bookkeeping, and the very core point is verification, but due to the differences in consensus mechanisms and data structures of different blockchains, another more core point is cross-chain message identification, because the prerequisite for verification is to identify these data messages (there is no identification problem in L2).\n\nSo how does one go about thinking about cross-chain message recognition as a cross-chain mortise and tenon structure? As mentioned above,\n\n* External verification, digesting cross-chain messages in an external validation federation by deploying our own smart contracts on different chains, so we have to trust this external validation federation and cannot reach trustless.\n* Local verification, where messaging is written in the contract as a form of logical structure (atomic exchange), which directly leads to its lower connectivity and very low statefulness, it can only deliver an exchange logic and not a generic ledger change type of message and cannot reach generalizability.\n* Native verification, messages are delivered directly in the original data structure, reach the target blockchain, and then the data stored in the original blockchain data structure is deconstructed, computed, and validated. This requires a codified medium in between to be able to understand and translate the data structure of the two blockchains. Different consensus algorithms pose a number of challenges, and even ZKP, which is the \"silver bullet\" for verification, encounters translation problems here. Therefore, it is difficult to make native verification scalable.\n\nThere are about two paths I can think of to solve this problem: one is the emergence of ZKP algorithms that support common consensus algorithms; the other is to build a message recognition middleware by non-intermediate consensus.\n\nSome immature thoughts. Feel free to discuss.\n\nMany thanks to Yang Peng and Xiang Wang for proofreading this paper.", "timestamp": 1655693194, "digest": "aFWuw4I8JpUKvinpR45-8mjvu2SAQxeviPT1IpFUwUU", "contributor": "0xCd7C1214359746E1A01Ef4aa8857C43a709062D1"}

Thus, the degree of trustless: native authentication > local authentication.\n\nAtomic exchange is characterized by implementing exchange operations inside a state update, typically including hash time locks and conditional transfers, etc.\n\n> **Atomic exchange across layers:** The naturally connected nature of the first layer across to the second layer allows them to easily perform conditional transfers since they are bookkeeping under the same set of books. Conditional transfers, where the first segment of an operation is triggered by the second segment, are an atomic exchange that is more straightforward than hash locks (HTLCs).\n> There is also a second interlayer spanning between layers. Some people will look at second layer spanning as distinct from cross-chaining, when in fact they have very few differences. The only difference between Layer 2 cross-layers and cross-chains is that they are previously connected through the Layer 1 network, which allows them to communicate through conditional transfers. However, this approach is simply too expensive, requiring each cross-layer to go through the first layer network, and suffers from slow speeds and congestion. As a result, layer 2 cross-layers are often viewed as different blockchains that are not connected.\n\n## Optimistic vs. External verification\n\nOptimistic verification and external verification both essentially have a set of third-party (non-related blockchain) nodes for verification. Beyond the many differences in technical details, the core difference lies in their cryptographic economics.\n\n* External verification (i.e., multi-signature, verifier, PoS, MPC, or threshold signature) cross-chain bridges utilize the honest majority assumption.\n* Optimistic verification uses the observer + fraud proof model, i.e. the verifier assumption of an honest person.\n\nTherefore, from a trustless perspective, optimistic verification requires significantly lower trust costs than external verification.\n\nIn contrast, among external validation, there are two main economic models.\n\n* Bonded: After malicious activity occurs, node collateral is forfeited, but the system does not guarantee to compensate users for losses, e.g. [Polygon PoS Bridge](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started/).\n* Insured: After malicious activity occurs, the node collateral is reduced, and the reduced collateral is used to compensate for the user's loss, e.g. [Axelar](https://axelar.network/).\n\nFrom this perspective, an insured external verification bridge can relatively minimize the level of trust.\n\n# Performance of trustless bridges\n\nDifferent authentication mechanisms also bring different security, speed, connectivity, capital efficiency, and statefulness correlations, which are commonly used [to evaluate bridge design](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/blockchain-bridges-5db6afac44f8).\n\n* Security: trust and validity assumptions, tolerance of malicious actors, security and inversity of user funds.\n* Speed: delay in completing transactions, and assurance of finality. There is often a trade-off between speed and security.\n* Connectivity: The choice of target chains for users and developers, and the different levels of difficulty in integrating additional target chains. Good connectivity means a high degree of compatibility with public chains and not easily limited by differences in consensus algorithms and data structures of different public chains.\n* Capital efficiency: The economics around the capital required to secure the system and the transaction costs of transferring assets.\n* Statefulness: The ability to transfer specific assets, more complex states, and/or perform cross-chain contract calls.\n\nDifferent validation approaches have different trade-offs, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Although there are some drawbacks to simply adding up the dimensions and calculating the total score for comparison, it seems that, as a rough guide, the total score ZKP > Light Clients & Relayers > Liquidity Networks = Optimistic > External Validators & Federations.\n\n![Performance of bridges with different authentication mechanisms](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h3a7wgi6akj21150i6aby.jpg)\n\nExternal validations excel in terms of statefulness and connectivity because they can trigger transactions, store data and allow interaction with that data on any number of target chains. Usually such third-party nodes require pledge mechanisms for security, so the capital efficiency of such bridges is minimal. In terms of security, since there are many types of externally verified bridges and different externally verified federations have different consensus algorithm security, their security cannot be generalized, but due to trust assumptions and third-party mechanisms, once the bridge is breached, the user may lose all their money and it will ripple through all the applications associated with the bridge, and their security is the lowest overall.\n\nOptimistic verification, which performs well in terms of statefulness and connectivity, is justified in the same way as external verification. However, due to the mechanism of optimistic verification, it is more capital efficient than external verification but less than bridge designs that do not require the guarantee of a cryptographic economic mechanism. Its speed is also the lowest due to the verification window period. In terms of security, the cost of attacking an Optimistic cross-chain bridge with `n` verifiers is equal to the cost of compromising or hacking `n` verifiers. And relative to external verification, the cost of an attack with `n` verifiers for an external verification cross-chain bridge is equal to the cost of compromising or hacking `m` verifiers, where `m` < `n` . In addition, with optimistic verification, even if `n` verifiers are hacked the attacker is not guaranteed to steal the funds, as long as an honest observer \"catches the fraud\" and revokes the attacker's access to the funds. Therefore, optimistic verification is generally more secure than external verifiers, but less secure than local verification and native verification mechanisms, where an attacker cannot steal funds at all.\n\nLocal validation (liquidity networks) excel in security and speed because the atomic exchange mechanism using hash time locks makes it impossible for funds to be stolen, and local validation without the need for universal consensus greatly increases speed. They are also more capital efficient than bonded/insured external verifiers, as capital efficiency is related to transaction flow/volume rather than security. However, because locally validated systems cannot support common data transfer between chains, their statefulness is poor, which leads to the fact that they often need to introduce other technical support to achieve more functionality, such as Hop's introduction of the Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB) and Connext's cooperation with Nomad.\n\nNative authentication performs very well in terms of security, capital efficiency and statefulness because it relies on the underlying trust and/or consensus mechanism of the domain to operate, and the blockhead relay system can pass any type of data without any pledge. Likewise, it must be customized for each type of domain. The Ethereum ecosystem is highly heterogeneous: ZK/optimistic aggregation, sidechains, and base chains running a large number of consensus algorithms such as ETH-PoW, Nakamoto-PoW, Tendermint-PoS, Snowball-PoS, PoA, and many others. Each of these areas requires a unique strategy to implement a natively verified interoperability system. In terms of connectivity, a native verification system using ZKP is a bit worse, since not every consensus model can be proven with zero knowledge. In terms of speed, ZKP cross-chain bridges have good low-latency properties and are also likely to be much cheaper than conventional blockhead relay systems because proving consensus does not need to happen on the chain.\n\n> In addition, LayerZero belongs to native authentication, and its innovation, even if small, is very important, introducing a prophecy machine to enable on-demand streaming of blockheads (instead of keeping all blockheads and reducing costs) and guaranteeing security due to the addition of an independent relay system on top of the prophecy machine.\n\n## Statefulness: Universal Messaging\n\nUniversal messaging is the ability to call any contract on different blockchains. So why does the cross-chain approach of locally validated networks not support generic messaging?\n\nIt is actually possible for a locally validated system to implement cross-domain contract calls, but only if the function being called has some form of logical owner. For example, it is possible to trustlessly call Uniswap's swap function across chains, since anyone with an exchangeable token can call the swap function. However, it is not possible to trustlessly lock and mint NFTs across chains in local validation - this is because the logical owner of the `mint` function on the destination chain should be the `lock` contract on the source chain.\n\nIntuitively, locally validated messages are sent from one contract on the chain to the same contract on another chain for function invocation through a single point of mutual validation, completing the transaction and state change within an atomic exchange process, and thus there is a logical problem of invocation; while messages of other validation methods pass the changed (fast) state through multiple points of validation, and there is no logical problem of invocation.\n\n## Connectivity: State Verification and Consensus Reaching\n\nAs already talked about, it is due to the different consensus algorithms of the different chains that break connectivity. How is this understood?\n\nTake the example of a transfer. Briefly, when a transfer occurs, a credential is generated at this point, and another chain learns that this is true than the transfer by verifying the change of credentials before it can initiate the next action. The process of generating this credential is the process of consensus algorithm, and the other chain needs to understand the credential (e.g., verify the hash) to simulate the way the credential is generated, and this is where different consensus algorithms can get in the way. At this point, the logic of ZKP is slightly different again, although the same generation algorithm can be used for ZKP, some of the consensus models are difficult to prove by zero knowledge.\n\n# A little reflection on horizontal mobility\n\nHorizontal liquidity refers to interoperability across chains to support messaging and asset transfer. Currently, there is no solution to the [trilemma](https://blog.connext.network/the-interoperability-trilemma-657c2cf69f17) of horizontal liquidity: trustless, scalability and generalizable. The NXTP proposed by Connext tries to build an interoperable network \"layer 2\" to solve this problem, based on the idea of the second layer of Ethereum, but I think the effectiveness of this solution remains to be examined.\n\nIn the scalability trilemma of Ethereum, it is verification that plays the role of a mortise and tenon structural connector, so it can be developed as a modular blockchain by breaking it down with verification as the mortise and tenon into executing (computation to verify), (verification result to build) consensus and data availability (to verify).\n\nRecently there have been voices talking about modular cross-chain bridges, which try to combine different cross-chain solutions and encapsulate them with the same interface, but this does not change the nature of the logic running under the package, and the problems that should exist remain. We need to find the mortise and tenon structure in the cross-chain problem to be able to disassemble a complex problem cleanly without breaking the original parts. Verification as a cross-chain mortise and tenon structure works because cross-chain is essentially cross-ledger bookkeeping, and the very core point is verification, but due to the differences in consensus mechanisms and data structures of different blockchains, another more core point is cross-chain message identification, because the prerequisite for verification is to identify these data messages (there is no identification problem in L2).\n\nSo how does one go about thinking about cross-chain message recognition as a cross-chain mortise and tenon structure? As mentioned above,\n\n* External verification, digesting cross-chain messages in an external validation federation by deploying our own smart contracts on different chains, so we have to trust this external validation federation and cannot reach trustless.\n* Local verification, where messaging is written in the contract as a form of logical structure (atomic exchange), which directly leads to its lower connectivity and very low statefulness, it can only deliver an exchange logic and not a generic ledger change type of message and cannot reach generalizability.\n* Native verification, messages are delivered directly in the original data structure, reach the target blockchain, and then the data stored in the original blockchain data structure is deconstructed, computed, and validated. This requires a codified medium in between to be able to understand and translate the data structure of the two blockchains. Different consensus algorithms pose a number of challenges, and even ZKP, which is the \"silver bullet\" for verification, encounters translation problems here. Therefore, it is difficult to make native verification scalable.\n\nThere are about two paths I can think of to solve this problem: one is the emergence of ZKP algorithms that support common consensus algorithms; the other is to build a message recognition middleware by non-intermediate consensus.\n\nSome immature thoughts.

Given this upheaval, it appears for the moment that the days of loose monetary policy, the backdrop to almost all of crypto history, are over. \n\nThe two exceptions to this pattern were brief periods in 2013 and 2018 when quantitative tightening was tentatively explored by central banks, curious 🤔. This is an interesting coincidence in hindsight given both of those periods coincide fairly closely with the last two crypto bear markets. \n\nThis year inflation-fighting central bankers have created significant volatility in global markets particularly in crypto, we have now seen several projects implode spectacularly over the last few months. If we are being honest it is likely this is just the beginning, when the easy money is switched off, many high-risk behaviours that were richly rewarded in the bull are exposed for the gambling they really were, and the subsequent pain that ensues is epic. We need to be realistic about the fact that many projects that have not managed risk well are likely to come under stress in the coming months. Projects that have been risk-averse and maintained a defensive footing are still going to face stress. Even the most defensive projects are not immune to failure in this environment.\n\nThe question each project must ask is how do we deal with this stress, how do we ensure it is discussed within our communities and in the broader crypto ecosystem? It is very tempting to project strength, but this temptation can lead you down a dark path where you are forced to go to greater and greater lengths to hide your growing weaknesses. This strategy inevitably creates opacity and confusion as project leaders try to spin the situation to create the illusion of security. Opacity and obfuscation are antithetical to DeFi. The reality is the only projects that can get away with this kind of behaviour, even for a short time, are centralised entities masquerading as DeFi. A true DeFi project simply cannot hide from the information available on-chain. That said, information on-chain can be hard to interpret and so it is possible, even for DeFi projects, to obfuscate and spin, we must resist this temptation and create a culture of openness and transparency.\n\nWhen we look at some of the recent incidents where founders attempted to quell fear right up until the moment of collapse, reactions tend to fall into two camps, the first is ‘these people were opportunistic psychopaths gaslighting everyone while extracting maximum value until the last minute’. The other end of the spectrum is, ‘these people were blissfully unaware of the risks they were incurring and were themselves shocked when it all fell apart.’ There is a middle ground between these two positions which is a little more generous to everyone involved in these catastrophes. The world is uncertain, it is extremely hard to predict the future and in the face of imperfect information hoping for the best and faking it until you make it are quite reasonable up to a point. The problem with this is you invariably begin obfuscating the truth and minimising risks. Is it any wonder then, that a person faced with such a situation often chooses self-immolation over coming clean and admitting they were hoping for a better outcome and they took too many risks that eventually caught up with them?\n\nIn my view, one of the best things about the Synthetix culture has always been our willingness as a community to confront risk with reasoned arguments and open debate, rather than obfuscation and opacity. Yet I believe the community can still do a better job of communicating risk. The complexity of the staking interfaces has forced most would-be stakers to have a better understanding of the underlying risks than they otherwise might have, but that is not enough. The reality is, staking SNX is high risk and complex, it is one of the most advanced activities you can do in DeFi right now. Come into the discord and watch a prospective staker ask why staking has to be so hard. Then observe as the community patiently explains that staking is high risk and they should ensure they understand their responsibilities before they stake. This has without a doubt limited the uptake of staking! But this is a trade-off the community has embraced fairly well. We can always improve though, there have definitely been times where the inflation-driven high APY from staking has been communicated without clearly calling out all the risks, but in a bull market attention is scarce and it is hard to blame the community for doing whatever it could to attract attention to the protocol and increase awareness given the high noise to signal ratio in bull markets.\n\nThat was quite the preamble, but now for the main point. This post will attempt to capture the current state of Synthetix as best as I can, I have solicited input from numerous people within the community as there are many initiatives and aspects of Synthetix that I am simply unable to keep track of at the level of scale and decentralisation Synthetix operates at.\n\nFirstly let’s look at the tech, Synthetix is running on a four-year-old platform architecture, which is kind of insane when you realise the original Havven contracts were deployed on an Ethereum network that was less than three years old at the time. While this legacy codebase is battle-hardened and well audited, we (either internally or via the community) occasionally find bugs that have been introduced over the years. The primary issue with maintaining this much legacy code is that modifying V2x is very high risk, there is a large amount of technical debt and many design decisions were made years ago by engineers who are no longer working on the project. But circumstances have forced us to respond to shifting market dynamics and recently more and more releases have been tacked on to this legacy code. This is unsustainable and it is time we said goodbye to V2x. The deprecation of V2x is close, but so long as the project is running on this code across two separate networks we are seriously constrained in what we can do and how much we can improve the protocol.\n\nEnter Synthetix V3, a completely redesigned version of the protocol running on an ultra-modern architecture that makes deployments and engineering orders of magnitude easier and safer. Unfortunately, while great progress has been made resources have been repeatedly diverted back to V2x to help with much needed releases and fixes that are inevitable as the market oscillates wildly at the end of an epic bull run. V3 is coming but until it is released the risk within the legacy system design must be considered when assessing the returns from staking SNX.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the economic health of the network. A naive observer would look at the entire history of Synthetix going back to March 2018 through early 2020 and say that based on price alone something seems to be going well. $2 SNX and a market cap of $500m+ looks great on paper. There is an issue though, between the time SNX last traded at $2 in June of 2020 through to today it experienced a 1,500% price appreciation and subsequent decline. With a network like Synthetix, while the incentives are structured to be able to absorb these kinds of cycles, unfortunately even the best incentives are not perfectly symmetrical and so the network is under far more pressure at $2 today than it was back before the start of DeFi summer. It is impossible to predict where the market might bottom from here. We are operating with a macro backdrop that has no equal except possibly the start of Covid, and even that looks like fun compared to what the next six months might bring to financial markets.\n\nGiven we can’t know where the bottom might be, let’s look at two key psychological levels for SNX, $1 and 50c. There is currently around $150m in debt backed by SNX in the network, at $1 SNX, in order to maintain a network ratio over 200% (the target is 300%, but during high volatility, we must expect that some of that buffer will be eroded) we need stakers to continue to pay down their debt even as they absorb liquidations to the tune of around $50m. Thankfully the CC’s were able to implement SIP-148 in time for the move from $5 down to $2, these socialised liquidations have already added significant confidence to the network.\n\nThis is critical to understand, Synthetix is an over-collateralised crypto-backed suite of stablecoins, it CAN implode. It hasn’t yet and this is a testament to the responsiveness of the community to difficult circumstances and a willingness to experiment with novel mechanisms to provide stability. But if BTC nukes to $3k tonight (an albeit unlikely scenario, but like what in the fuck is even happening right now, so who knows) it is extremely likely Synthetix and many other DeFi protocols would struggle to absorb this volatility. Leading to cascading liquidations and chaos. It is certainly possible the Synthetix network and other DeFi projects could recover, but what that would look like is an exercise for another time. The good news is anyone can inspect the health of the network and all of DeFi, of course, you still need to make some assumptions about the responses to incentives of individual participants but all of the data is at least available. \n\nIt is worth discussing governance for a second, I’m planning a much more comprehensive post on what passes for “governance” across much of crypto these days, but that post is still in draft. What we can say is that there is no opaque centralised body the Synthetix network relies on to “guard” the Synthetix protocol. It is incentives all the way down. We have a group of elected Councils that all work together to manage the risk of the network on behalf of token holders, and while these governance bodies have discretion they are ultimately responsible to token holders. So how likely is it that this $50m figure is available to pay down the debt as the collateral value declines? Looking at the major wallets in the ecosystem there is significantly more than $50m in stables at least in principle, available to address debt.\n\nBetween $1 and 50c it is likely a further 50m in debt needs to be absorbed, these numbers are approximations for a number of reasons. The primary one is that it depends on the percentage of the network that is liquidated on the way down, as well as what the price of ETH and BTC do, because the debt pool is skewed long, stakers profit when ETH declines which reduces the debt. This provides some cushion in a falling market. The largest holder of SNX and debt, the treasury council, is committed to servicing its debt which takes a lot of stress off smaller holders. The fact that none of the top twenty wallets have been liquidated even as the price of SNX has declined by 80% also inspires confidence in the commitment of large stakers to the network. But it is critical to understand there are risks here, any protocol or platform that tries to claim it is risk-free is absolutely bullshitting you, as we have all painfully experienced lately. \n\nWhether the rest of the stakers continue to pay down debt will be based on how confident they are the network will remain solvent. At the current SNX/ETH ratio 50c SNX would require ETH below $400, at those levels there will be major stress throughout crypto so predicting the behaviour of individual actors becomes more challenging. But fundamentally, provided there are sufficient well capitalised stakers in the network there is no reason to believe that the debt will not continue to be burned even if the SNX price continues to fall.\n\nThere is some good news though, the recent volatility has led to a significant increase in trading volumes, which means even ignoring inflation, if SNX falls below $1 and exchange volume remains constant, staking yields from sUSD fees generated by the protocol will be well over 20% APY. This should help provide confidence for the stakers who remain and continue to pay down debt as these fees can be put directly to servicing debt each week. The growth has been so profound that less than a week ago I predicted on twitter that Synthetix would flip BTC on daily fees generated, as of a few days ago that came to [pass](https://twitter.com/0x_____________/status/1537667133718646784/photo/1).\n\n![This is now out of date!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WhCaVy7Q4lTHOf8X4DHKr.png?height=1448&width=1174)\n\nThe other aspect of the project that continues to inspire confidence and honestly gets way too little awareness outside the community is that Synthetix is one of the few protocols that has fully decentralised governance yet is able to maintain a rapid pace of iteration and experimentation. This is simply not even close to being priced in by the market. But as things slow down it will become increasingly clear that the investment in community governance made by Synthetix has created incredible value. This will only accelerate as V3GM launches and other protocols begin to adopt the Synthetix governance framework.\n\nAs the dust settles over the next few months, it will become clear which projects have employed good governance to manage risk and which were picking up pennies in front of steamrollers. Personally, I have made my [decision](https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1531432524991168512?s=20&t=DlM7Dhf354Vx3ul1rinl8g) as to how that will play out.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY3xrjSibYAYZusZyQYKY.png?height=590&width=1178)\n\nWhile it is impossible to have certainty in this environment, one can still maintain conviction. Without conviction, you are dead in the water in crypto. Times like these will test even those of us with the highest conviction, it is worth remembering that it is ok to have doubts and you should always question your assumptions. That is how we move the space forward. \n\nI would like to thank the Synthetix community, Spartan Council members and the core contributors for the dedication, engagement and perseverance they have demonstrated during these challenging times.

The reality is the only projects that can get away with this kind of behaviour, even for a short time, are centralised entities masquerading as DeFi. A true DeFi project simply cannot hide from the information available on-chain. That said, information on-chain can be hard to interpret and so it is possible, even for DeFi projects, to obfuscate and spin, we must resist this temptation and create a culture of openness and transparency.\n\nWhen we look at some of the recent incidents where founders attempted to quell fear right up until the moment of collapse, reactions tend to fall into two camps, the first is ‘these people were opportunistic psychopaths gaslighting everyone while extracting maximum value until the last minute’. The other end of the spectrum is, ‘these people were blissfully unaware of the risks they were incurring and were themselves shocked when it all fell apart.’ There is a middle ground between these two positions which is a little more generous to everyone involved in these catastrophes. The world is uncertain, it is extremely hard to predict the future and in the face of imperfect information hoping for the best and faking it until you make it are quite reasonable up to a point. The problem with this is you invariably begin obfuscating the truth and minimising risks. Is it any wonder then, that a person faced with such a situation often chooses self-immolation over coming clean and admitting they were hoping for a better outcome and they took too many risks that eventually caught up with them?\n\nIn my view, one of the best things about the Synthetix culture has always been our willingness as a community to confront risk with reasoned arguments and open debate, rather than obfuscation and opacity. Yet I believe the community can still do a better job of communicating risk. The complexity of the staking interfaces has forced most would-be stakers to have a better understanding of the underlying risks than they otherwise might have, but that is not enough. The reality is, staking SNX is high risk and complex, it is one of the most advanced activities you can do in DeFi right now. Come into the discord and watch a prospective staker ask why staking has to be so hard. Then observe as the community patiently explains that staking is high risk and they should ensure they understand their responsibilities before they stake. This has without a doubt limited the uptake of staking! But this is a trade-off the community has embraced fairly well. We can always improve though, there have definitely been times where the inflation-driven high APY from staking has been communicated without clearly calling out all the risks, but in a bull market attention is scarce and it is hard to blame the community for doing whatever it could to attract attention to the protocol and increase awareness given the high noise to signal ratio in bull markets.\n\nThat was quite the preamble, but now for the main point. This post will attempt to capture the current state of Synthetix as best as I can, I have solicited input from numerous people within the community as there are many initiatives and aspects of Synthetix that I am simply unable to keep track of at the level of scale and decentralisation Synthetix operates at.\n\nFirstly let’s look at the tech, Synthetix is running on a four-year-old platform architecture, which is kind of insane when you realise the original Havven contracts were deployed on an Ethereum network that was less than three years old at the time. While this legacy codebase is battle-hardened and well audited, we (either internally or via the community) occasionally find bugs that have been introduced over the years. The primary issue with maintaining this much legacy code is that modifying V2x is very high risk, there is a large amount of technical debt and many design decisions were made years ago by engineers who are no longer working on the project. But circumstances have forced us to respond to shifting market dynamics and recently more and more releases have been tacked on to this legacy code. This is unsustainable and it is time we said goodbye to V2x. The deprecation of V2x is close, but so long as the project is running on this code across two separate networks we are seriously constrained in what we can do and how much we can improve the protocol.\n\nEnter Synthetix V3, a completely redesigned version of the protocol running on an ultra-modern architecture that makes deployments and engineering orders of magnitude easier and safer. Unfortunately, while great progress has been made resources have been repeatedly diverted back to V2x to help with much needed releases and fixes that are inevitable as the market oscillates wildly at the end of an epic bull run. V3 is coming but until it is released the risk within the legacy system design must be considered when assessing the returns from staking SNX.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the economic health of the network. A naive observer would look at the entire history of Synthetix going back to March 2018 through early 2020 and say that based on price alone something seems to be going well. $2 SNX and a market cap of $500m+ looks great on paper. There is an issue though, between the time SNX last traded at $2 in June of 2020 through to today it experienced a 1,500% price appreciation and subsequent decline. With a network like Synthetix, while the incentives are structured to be able to absorb these kinds of cycles, unfortunately even the best incentives are not perfectly symmetrical and so the network is under far more pressure at $2 today than it was back before the start of DeFi summer. It is impossible to predict where the market might bottom from here. We are operating with a macro backdrop that has no equal except possibly the start of Covid, and even that looks like fun compared to what the next six months might bring to financial markets.\n\nGiven we can’t know where the bottom might be, let’s look at two key psychological levels for SNX, $1 and 50c. There is currently around $150m in debt backed by SNX in the network, at $1 SNX, in order to maintain a network ratio over 200% (the target is 300%, but during high volatility, we must expect that some of that buffer will be eroded) we need stakers to continue to pay down their debt even as they absorb liquidations to the tune of around $50m. Thankfully the CC’s were able to implement SIP-148 in time for the move from $5 down to $2, these socialised liquidations have already added significant confidence to the network.\n\nThis is critical to understand, Synthetix is an over-collateralised crypto-backed suite of stablecoins, it CAN implode. It hasn’t yet and this is a testament to the responsiveness of the community to difficult circumstances and a willingness to experiment with novel mechanisms to provide stability. But if BTC nukes to $3k tonight (an albeit unlikely scenario, but like what in the fuck is even happening right now, so who knows) it is extremely likely Synthetix and many other DeFi protocols would struggle to absorb this volatility. Leading to cascading liquidations and chaos. It is certainly possible the Synthetix network and other DeFi projects could recover, but what that would look like is an exercise for another time. The good news is anyone can inspect the health of the network and all of DeFi, of course, you still need to make some assumptions about the responses to incentives of individual participants but all of the data is at least available. \n\nIt is worth discussing governance for a second, I’m planning a much more comprehensive post on what passes for “governance” across much of crypto these days, but that post is still in draft. What we can say is that there is no opaque centralised body the Synthetix network relies on to “guard” the Synthetix protocol. It is incentives all the way down. We have a group of elected Councils that all work together to manage the risk of the network on behalf of token holders, and while these governance bodies have discretion they are ultimately responsible to token holders. So how likely is it that this $50m figure is available to pay down the debt as the collateral value declines? Looking at the major wallets in the ecosystem there is significantly more than $50m in stables at least in principle, available to address debt.\n\nBetween $1 and 50c it is likely a further 50m in debt needs to be absorbed, these numbers are approximations for a number of reasons. The primary one is that it depends on the percentage of the network that is liquidated on the way down, as well as what the price of ETH and BTC do, because the debt pool is skewed long, stakers profit when ETH declines which reduces the debt. This provides some cushion in a falling market. The largest holder of SNX and debt, the treasury council, is committed to servicing its debt which takes a lot of stress off smaller holders. The fact that none of the top twenty wallets have been liquidated even as the price of SNX has declined by 80% also inspires confidence in the commitment of large stakers to the network. But it is critical to understand there are risks here, any protocol or platform that tries to claim it is risk-free is absolutely bullshitting you, as we have all painfully experienced lately. \n\nWhether the rest of the stakers continue to pay down debt will be based on how confident they are the network will remain solvent. At the current SNX/ETH ratio 50c SNX would require ETH below $400, at those levels there will be major stress throughout crypto so predicting the behaviour of individual actors becomes more challenging. But fundamentally, provided there are sufficient well capitalised stakers in the network there is no reason to believe that the debt will not continue to be burned even if the SNX price continues to fall.\n\nThere is some good news though, the recent volatility has led to a significant increase in trading volumes, which means even ignoring inflation, if SNX falls below $1 and exchange volume remains constant, staking yields from sUSD fees generated by the protocol will be well over 20% APY. This should help provide confidence for the stakers who remain and continue to pay down debt as these fees can be put directly to servicing debt each week. The growth has been so profound that less than a week ago I predicted on twitter that Synthetix would flip BTC on daily fees generated, as of a few days ago that came to [pass](https://twitter.com/0x_____________/status/1537667133718646784/photo/1).\n\n![This is now out of date!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WhCaVy7Q4lTHOf8X4DHKr.png?height=1448&width=1174)\n\nThe other aspect of the project that continues to inspire confidence and honestly gets way too little awareness outside the community is that Synthetix is one of the few protocols that has fully decentralised governance yet is able to maintain a rapid pace of iteration and experimentation. This is simply not even close to being priced in by the market. But as things slow down it will become increasingly clear that the investment in community governance made by Synthetix has created incredible value. This will only accelerate as V3GM launches and other protocols begin to adopt the Synthetix governance framework.\n\nAs the dust settles over the next few months, it will become clear which projects have employed good governance to manage risk and which were picking up pennies in front of steamrollers. Personally, I have made my [decision](https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1531432524991168512?s=20&t=DlM7Dhf354Vx3ul1rinl8g) as to how that will play out.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY3xrjSibYAYZusZyQYKY.png?height=590&width=1178)\n\nWhile it is impossible to have certainty in this environment, one can still maintain conviction. Without conviction, you are dead in the water in crypto. Times like these will test even those of us with the highest conviction, it is worth remembering that it is ok to have doubts and you should always question your assumptions. That is how we move the space forward. \n\nI would like to thank the Synthetix community, Spartan Council members and the core contributors for the dedication, engagement and perseverance they have demonstrated during these challenging times.

Given this upheaval, it appears for the moment that the days of loose monetary policy, the backdrop to almost all of crypto history, are over. \n\nThe two exceptions to this pattern were brief periods in 2013 and 2018 when quantitative tightening was tentatively explored by central banks, curious 🤔. This is an interesting coincidence in hindsight given both of those periods coincide fairly closely with the last two crypto bear markets. \n\nThis year inflation-fighting central bankers have created significant volatility in global markets particularly in crypto, we have now seen several projects implode spectacularly over the last few months. If we are being honest it is likely this is just the beginning, when the easy money is switched off, many high-risk behaviours that were richly rewarded in the bull are exposed for the gambling they really were, and the subsequent pain that ensues is epic. We need to be realistic about the fact that many projects that have not managed risk well are likely to come under stress in the coming months. Projects that have been risk-averse and maintained a defensive footing are still going to face stress. Even the most defensive projects are not immune to failure in this environment.\n\nThe question each project must ask is how do we deal with this stress, how do we ensure it is discussed within our communities and in the broader crypto ecosystem? It is very tempting to project strength, but this temptation can lead you down a dark path where you are forced to go to greater and greater lengths to hide your growing weaknesses. This strategy inevitably creates opacity and confusion as project leaders try to spin the situation to create the illusion of security. Opacity and obfuscation are antithetical to DeFi.

We have a group of elected Councils that all work together to manage the risk of the network on behalf of token holders, and while these governance bodies have discretion they are ultimately responsible to token holders. So how likely is it that this $50m figure is available to pay down the debt as the collateral value declines? Looking at the major wallets in the ecosystem there is significantly more than $50m in stables at least in principle, available to address debt.\n\nBetween $1 and 50c it is likely a further 50m in debt needs to be absorbed, these numbers are approximations for a number of reasons. The primary one is that it depends on the percentage of the network that is liquidated on the way down, as well as what the price of ETH and BTC do, because the debt pool is skewed long, stakers profit when ETH declines which reduces the debt. This provides some cushion in a falling market. The largest holder of SNX and debt, the treasury council, is committed to servicing its debt which takes a lot of stress off smaller holders. The fact that none of the top twenty wallets have been liquidated even as the price of SNX has declined by 80% also inspires confidence in the commitment of large stakers to the network. But it is critical to understand there are risks here, any protocol or platform that tries to claim it is risk-free is absolutely bullshitting you, as we have all painfully experienced lately. \n\nWhether the rest of the stakers continue to pay down debt will be based on how confident they are the network will remain solvent. At the current SNX/ETH ratio 50c SNX would require ETH below $400, at those levels there will be major stress throughout crypto so predicting the behaviour of individual actors becomes more challenging. But fundamentally, provided there are sufficient well capitalised stakers in the network there is no reason to believe that the debt will not continue to be burned even if the SNX price continues to fall.\n\nThere is some good news though, the recent volatility has led to a significant increase in trading volumes, which means even ignoring inflation, if SNX falls below $1 and exchange volume remains constant, staking yields from sUSD fees generated by the protocol will be well over 20% APY. This should help provide confidence for the stakers who remain and continue to pay down debt as these fees can be put directly to servicing debt each week. The growth has been so profound that less than a week ago I predicted on twitter that Synthetix would flip BTC on daily fees generated, as of a few days ago that came to [pass](https://twitter.com/0x_____________/status/1537667133718646784/photo/1).\n\n![This is now out of date!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WhCaVy7Q4lTHOf8X4DHKr.png?height=1448&width=1174)\n\nThe other aspect of the project that continues to inspire confidence and honestly gets way too little awareness outside the community is that Synthetix is one of the few protocols that has fully decentralised governance yet is able to maintain a rapid pace of iteration and experimentation. This is simply not even close to being priced in by the market. But as things slow down it will become increasingly clear that the investment in community governance made by Synthetix has created incredible value. This will only accelerate as V3GM launches and other protocols begin to adopt the Synthetix governance framework.\n\nAs the dust settles over the next few months, it will become clear which projects have employed good governance to manage risk and which were picking up pennies in front of steamrollers. Personally, I have made my [decision](https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1531432524991168512?s=20&t=DlM7Dhf354Vx3ul1rinl8g) as to how that will play out.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY3xrjSibYAYZusZyQYKY.png?height=590&width=1178)\n\nWhile it is impossible to have certainty in this environment, one can still maintain conviction. Without conviction, you are dead in the water in crypto. Times like these will test even those of us with the highest conviction, it is worth remembering that it is ok to have doubts and you should always question your assumptions. That is how we move the space forward. \n\nI would like to thank the Synthetix community, Spartan Council members and the core contributors for the dedication, engagement and perseverance they have demonstrated during these challenging times. WMMI.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1655693723, "digest": "cHxVE_FTLbwU_VFJCA74mcsXqy_1VZLEqbOGCQJWoQk", "contributor": "0x42f9134E9d3Bf7eEE1f8A5Ac2a4328B059E7468c"}

稳定币 TVL 180B - 真实收入模型，\n最近，每当有人问我“加密市场的情况如何”， 我告诉他们想象 2008 年的次贷危机，但没有政府救助 ， 贷款违约、不良资产、级联清算、破产，我们得到了一切\n不受欢迎的观点：今天#DeFi提供的当前收益率在很大程度上不值得冒险， 特别是在这些市场条件下，庞氏激励系统以前从未经历过这些类型的市场条件 ， 这也适用于 CeFi / CeDeFi，这自然是一系列风险，每个机会都需要单独考虑 ， 但目前的收益率感觉与所承担的风险水平不同步 ， 特别是如果您没有设置 24/7 全天候监控您的职位， 当您将资产存放在某处时，您是否考虑到： 智能合约风险， 治理风险， 死亡螺旋风险， 破产风险， 流动风险， 托管风险， 甲骨文风险， 资产风险， 地毯风险 ， 现在是时候重新评估您的风险敞口了，\nbanteg ,@bantg,

大规模采用即将到来，但我们必须消除所有阻碍加密经济增长和成熟的废话。 现在是开始的结束。 这就是我今天得到的所有hopium。 无论如何，感谢明年的世代购买机会。\n[balajis.com](http://balajis.com) , @balajis\n无\nMartin Köppelmann， @koeppelmann， @CirclesUBI, @gnosisPM\nOEV -

{"id": "SyjHX2-jUlQhgPXDD-XfJ_y5JFk3pke8CQGhWnwNKNw", "title": "夏日四则", "body": "初夏初夏羞怯地来到世间，像小孩子。小孩子见到生人会不好意思。尽管是在他的家，他还是要羞怯，会脸红，尽管没有让他脸红的事情发生。小孩子在羞怯和脸红中欢迎客人，他的眼睛热切地望着你，用牙咬着衣衫或咬着自己的手指肚。你越看他，他越羞怯，直至跑掉。但过一会儿他还要转回来。这就是初夏。\n\n初夏悄悄地来到世间，踮着脚尖小跑，但它跑不远，它要蓬蓬勃勃地跑回来。春天在前些时候开了那么多的花，相当于吹喇叭，招揽人来观看。人们想知道这么多鲜花带来了什么，有怎样的新鲜、丰润与壮硕。鲜花只带来了一样东西，它是春天的儿子，叫初夏。初夏初长成，但很快要生产更多的儿子与女儿，人们称之为夏天。夏天不止于草长莺飞，草占领了所有的土地，莺下了许多蛋。夏天是一个昏暗的绿世界，草木恨不能长出八只手来抢夺阳光。此时创造了许多阴凉，昆虫在树荫下昏昏欲睡。\n\n人早已经历过夏天，但初夏第一次度夏。初夏走进湿漉漉的雨林，有人问它天空为什么下雨，初夏又扭捏一下，它也是第一次见到雨。这些清凉的雨滴从天空降落，它是从喷壶还是筛子里降落到地面？天上是不是也有一条河？初夏由于回答不出这些问题而脸红了，比苹果早红两个月。初夏坐在河流上，坐在长出嫩叶的树桩上。初夏目测大地与星空之间的距离。它寻找春天剩下的花瓣，把它们埋在土里或丢在河里漂走。初夏藏在花朵的叶子下面等待蜜蜂来临。初夏把行囊塞了一遍又一遍，还有挺多草木塞不进去。要装下这么多东西，除非是一列火车。\n\n仲夏夏天好似乐曲里的中板，它的绿、星斗的整齐和蛙鸣呈现中和之美。夏日与夏夜的节奏匀称，它的肢体饱满。夏天的一切都饱满，像一池绿水要漫出来。庄稼和草都在匀称之间达到饱满。夏日的生命最丰富，庞杂却秩序清晰。生命，是说所有生灵的命，不光包括庄稼和草，还有几千种小虫子。有的小虫用一天时间从柳枝的这一端爬到那一端，而它不过活十天左右。小虫不会因为一生只有十天而快跑或慢爬，更不会因此哭泣。每一种生物对时间的感受都不一样，而“百”和“年”只是人发明出来的说辞。小虫的时间是一条梦幻的河流，没有“年月日”。命对人来说是寿，对小虫来说是自然。虫鸟比人更懂缘起性空的道理。\n\n夏天盛大，到处都是生命的集市。夏天的白昼那么长，仍然不够用。万物借太阳的光照节节生长。老天爷看它们已经长疯了，让夜过来笼罩它们，让它们歇歇。有的东西——比如高粱和玉米，在夜里偷着“咔咔”拔节，没停止过生长。这是庄稼的梦游症。在夏日，管弦乐队所有的乐器全都奏响。电闪雷鸣是打击乐，雾是双簧管，柔和弥漫，檐下雨滴是竖琴，从石缝跳下来的山泉水也是竖琴。大提琴是大地的呼吸，大地的肺要把草木吸入的废气全吐出来。它怕吓到柔弱的草，缓缓吐出气。这气息在夜里如同歌声，是天籁地籁人籁中的歌声。\n\n许许多多的草木只有春天和夏天，没有秋天，就像死去的人看不见自己墓地的风景一样。\n\n夏夜深邃。如果夜是一片海，夏夜的海水最深，上面浮着星星的岛屿。在夏夜，许多星星似乎被海冲走了。不知从哪里漂来新的星屿，它们比原来的岛屿更白净。\n\n夏天流行的传染病中，最严重的是虫子和青蛙所患的呼喊强迫症。它们的呼喊声停不下来，它们的耳朵必须听到自己的喊声，听上去如同赞美夏天。夏天如此丰满，虫与蛙的呼声再多一倍也不算多，赞美每一棵苹果和樱桃的甜美，赞美高粱谷子暗中结穗，花朵把花粉撒在四面八方。河床满了，小鸟的羽毛干干净净，土地随时长出新的植物。虫子要为这些奇迹喊破嗓子，青蛙把肚子喊得像气球一样透明。\n\n雨下在夏至的土地上到了夏至，雨水不再是陌生人，它们像投奔故乡的游子，踩着云彩回到夏至的土地上。\n\n夏至，雨的声音大过河水声、庄稼拔节声、蛙声。雨说给土地的话，要在夏至这一天一夜说完，土地根本没有插话的机会。对雨水而言，春秋冬三季造访土地只算做客，夏至才回到自己的家。\n\n草毛了，从春天开始，草在雨水的定额里断断续续生长，属于计划经济。而到夏至，草逢豪雨，尽情挥霍，一边喝一边生长，还有余裕的水分洗一洗脚丫缝儿的泥。水有的是，草在风里甩去袖子上的水。白天，城里的草呆观街景，在夜里像冲锋一般疯长。以往如城堡一般的云朵全向夏至投降，化为宽大的灰筛子筛雨，减轻天空的重量。\n\n二十四节气里边，夏至是第十个节气。公历6月22日前后，太阳到达黄经90°，此为天文学之夏至点。这一天，按照旧学说法，阳气极至，阴气始至，太阳北至。夏至之时好像十二时辰中的午时，11点～13点，阳鼎盛而催阴生。这个月，属十二生肖的午马当令，奔腾暴烈，下点雨只是小意思。卖弄一点中医学说，午时或者夏至，归于十二正经中的心经。心为火脏，刚烈蓬勃。火与心、马与午、夏与阳，都说生机勃发之至，乃至夏至。\n\n大地母亲一手拢过雨水的子女，一手拢过草木的儿孙。这时候，大地最高兴，像看见满院子孩儿乱跑，天真无邪，比秋天的成熟还好看。\n\n七月有权利炎热七月有权利下小雨、大雨和暴雨。野草在汪洋中露出绝望的头颅，它的手在积水里写了无数个水字，却没一个字浮出水面。七月悬挂着骄阳的火炉，把土壤晒得开裂，蚂蚁得到纵横四海的地道。野蜂在七月结成网，吮取所有植物的花粉，让大地变成蜜地。野蜂改变了七月份每一个早晨的气味，在青草的苦味和河流的腥味里加入透明的甜。空气如同黏稠的漩涡，不知去哪一棵树上结晶。\n\n七月在每天的傍晚都戴上玫瑰色的草帽儿，帽檐宽至天际。地上的花朵与西山的晚霞共同跳一支舞。它们的舞步在风里燃烧，草帽里露出窟窿，露出隐藏在里边的星星。", "timestamp": 1655694797, "digest": "-qknb3DFYGm0oAJWD3f6naI4WKOWosrtkAO0J3l5f0I", "contributor": "0x986255feb8f44E52B0Bf8F84211B12952198738D"}

And we’re not going to the Endstate alone. We’re collaborating with athletes, artists, creators, and brands to bring their stories to life by uniting the physical, the digital and the experiential. With every collaboration we’re building towards a future where physical and digital are completely entangled.\n\nChanging product ownership forever means that we cannot stop at sneakers. Working to grow Endstate into a boundary-defying brand means building out expansive experiences in 3D, AR, apparel, and collectibles of all kinds.\n\nToday, we’re proud to announce $5.5 million in funding from a world class group of institutional and angel investors who share our ambition to usher in the future of product ownership:\n\n**Archetype Ventures**: top-shelf credentials and huge network in the crypto space, we couldn’t have asked for a better lead.\n\n**Accomplice Ventures**: track record speaks for itself - the ultimate resource as we work to grow Endstate into a global brand.\n\n**Castle Island Ventures**: some of the most outspoken advocates and greatest thinkers in the crypto space.

{"id": "NIHWCtBpyn3itwcsALi2tp_QPDg85Y4A0w_cuIKg2iI", "title": "What Problem Does Web3 Solve, Anyway?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zl272m8PrjRBlG02jbAeR.png?height=925&width=1055)\n\nI want to start this post off by stating that I have very little interest in freakishly expensive cartoon animal JPEGs, private Discord servers, or hexagon profile photos. When people think of web3, or look at what the “people in web3” are doing, outside of direct scams this is generally what they see. It looks as though the highest achievement of this third web is that the rich and famous have been given a new way to show everyone how disconnected they are from reality. And they are. I don’t have a lot of explanations for it, and while I too got caught up and enamored with expensive cartoons during the peak of the mania, I have no desire to rationalize any of it away. Instead, for this post, I want to look beyond it.\n\nMy view of web3 is that it offers an important unlock for software developers. It allows them to build and consume general-purpose, open, permanent protocols and APIs that are paid for by their consumers in real-time. These protocols and APIs provide a universal database that can be used by anyone. It allows for permanent, unique objects that can be taken anywhere across the internet without losing sight of their owners, creators, and history. If ape JPEGs are a terrible cartoon use case for this new unlock, what other real-world use cases might be more exciting?\n\nMost real-world web3 protocols and apps right now (that aren’t scams) are financial, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for trading assets, [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for getting yield on assets, and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) for borrowing and lending. At first glance, we might simply see new ways for degenerates to gamble. And we’d be right. If we change lenses, however, and simply look at what has been built we’ll see open protocols that anyone can build a frontend for without the need to ask for API keys. They can be incorporated into anything and remixed by anyone. And, if the promise of holds, they can't be shut down or their data corrupted.\n\nTo build other non-financial services at scale, we’re going to need to batch transactions saving users on insanely high transaction costs. [This is happening](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/), however, for the rest of this post, I want to ignore that. This post won’t talk about scaling solutions or different chains or throw obscure silly technical terms at you. Instead, I just want to answer the questions: “What problem does web3 solve, anyway? What will it look like?”\n\n[Web3, Explained](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1535377548388945920)\n\n> *TL;DR: Web3 offers a general-purpose way to represent ownership of data, assets, and certificates that maintain their authenticity, history, and ownership state across the web.*\n\n## The Limits of Web2\n\nAsset titles, licenses, and certificates can't live on the internet easily in a truly meaningful and native way. If you do put them online, there’s very little one can do to ensure they are authentic or valid, especially if you want them to remain authentic across platforms without building special-purpose APIs and integrations. Allowing their ownership and control to be easily transferred between different people and applications is also not trivial.\n\nIf you graduated from Harvard and you want this achievement displayed on some online profile in a way that can be easily verified, Harvard would need to build and host an API that exposes their alumni list mapped to user accounts in their database, as well as a way for apps to authenticate their users to ensure that they are who they say they are. And Harvard would need to pay a full-time team to maintain these services. And all the apps that want to get this data would need to create a developer account with the Harvard Web Services and get an API key to ensure they don't spam the service. Assuming that anyone would want this for any reason, it’s entirely infeasible and almost certainly not worth the effort.\n\nInstead, we can simplify the entire thing by schools issuing an NFT to students. So long as an app/user knows the Harvard crypto address or domain name, they can verify that someone does have a real degree from Harvard, and it will work as well as someone’s ability to currently verify that someone has a “real ape NFT”. The amount of effort this would take is trivial.\n\nExpand this Harvard example, which is incredibly general, to certificates and licenses in general. Companies online want to build applications connecting licensed people who hold a certificate for X with their clients, while removing manual verifications and minimizing fake accounts. NFTs allow us to do this.\n\nAs far as I can tell, bringing real-world assets and certificates online in a truly native way is incredibly powerful. Currently, if you are issued a certificate that says you are licensed to do {X}, the certificate can only be brought online within the confines of the issuer. You have to log onto their website/app to see any version that other people will trust. If other applications or people want to verify it outside of their site, the issuer has to build an API and service allowing you to authenticate yourself and verify it. the issuer has to host, serve, and control the certificate, and there’s no way for you to take control of it and bring it with you anywhere you want online, without each platform building special-purpose integrations for you. Instead, if a certificate issuer gives you an NFT representing your certificate, you can bring it with you anywhere so long as you can connect your wallet. Your real-estate, hairdressing, law, financial advisor, etc. licenses can all be posted to the top of your Instagram page automatically, allowing anyone to trivially check who issued it and verify its authenticity. All that is required is that you connect your wallet.\n\nBased on many conversions I’ve had, people seem to be easily confused by this concept. “What makes one NFT authentic and others not?”, they ask. “Anyone can create an NFT of anything. I can create an NFT that looks exactly like all of the other real-estate licenses and post it to my Instagram. Who’s to say mine is fake? How would anyone know?” The answer is identity and provenance.\n\nFor something to be considered authentic, we need to know where it came from. In the art world, this concept is known as provenance, and NFTs give us perfect provenance. When I look at the real-estate license NFT on your Instagram account, I’ll be able to click into it and see its token ID, the contract/collection it belongs to, and who issued it. And if it wasn’t issued by NMLS, then I can be near certain that it’s a fake. If I’m feeling extra suspicious, I can open a second application like Etherscan and confirm. I’ll be able to see that you issued it to yourself. The same applies to Nike shoes, art, home titles, etc. If Instagram were so inclined, it could choose to control a list of verified wallets, so that NFTs issued by NMLS and Nike would automatically show a check mark, while others wouldn’t.\n\n## Extending Web2\n\nYelp owns all of the restaurant reviews instead of restaurants and reviewers. If someone wants to compete with Yelp they have to start from scratch. If a restaurant decides they don’t like yelp anymore, they can’t easily take their reviews to a new app or platform without the reviews losing their credibility.\n\nIn contrast, when I build an app or website today I sit on the shoulders of giants. I have a seemingly infinite number of code packages, libraries, snippets, and APIs available to me, and I can use all of these tools to help me build things faster. I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I start a new project. However, if I want to build a competitor to Yelp, again, there is one major area where I have to start from scratch: the data and user base. Even if I scraped Yelp and ported all of their reviews, there’s no reason anyone should assume that the reviews are authentic, because they’ve been disconnected from their creators' accounts.\n\nA web3 version of Yelp, if it lives up to its promise, takes the data and infrastructure and makes it available to anyone while not being under the control of any single entity. Any developer can build a new UI for it. Instead of restaurants and users being tied down to one company, they are free to pick and choose whichever apps they please that connect to open protocols. We would no longer have a single company called Yelp. We would instead have an open and permanent protocol and database, and a potentially infinite number of Yelp competitors connected to it, all sharing the same data. Instead of competing with each other on who can hoard the most data, they would compete on their user experiences and services.\n\nYelp is a pretty inconsequential example. We can apply the same logic to public transportation networks like Uber and Lyft, or services like Airbnb, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, GoodReads, or your Twitter social graph.\n\nAs an Airbnb host, you can’t move platforms easily without losing the credibility of your reviews. you might have spent years building your review score, but now are stuck with a company that continues to increase their take rate, when you want desperately to move to a new platform. If both your listing and it’s reviews were on a neutral protocol similar in kind to something like [@LensProtocol](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol), you could seamlessly move to any competitor also building on the same protocol. In fact, you could exist on all platforms built on the same protocol simultaneously.\n\nOn Twitter, @liron [argues](https://twitter.com/liron/status/1531825233132277760) that the non-existence of a web3 Airbnb is evidence that not only is the project infeasible now but that almost nothing of value can be built here. And he’s right that none of these examples exist yet, but it doesn’t seem to me that we should assume they are impossible in principle. One example we can look at to confirm this is [ENS](http://ens.domains): all of the rules, domains and associated data live on the Ethereum blockchain. Any app can plug directly into the protocol and build their own services around it. People are doing this by building ENS specific [tools](https://ens.tools/domains) and no-fee [marketplaces](https://twitter.com/kodexapp). The Rainbow mobile app is doing this by allowing their users to [register ENS domains](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1536804795075502080) directly in their app. Any app ([and there are many](https://ens.domains/#home-ecosystem)) can pull the ENS data automatically and verify that a wallet owns a specific domain without needing to ask for permission. Granting the assumption that Ethereum is capable of scaling, there’s no difference between the domain names on ENS and the restaurant reviews on a hypothetical web3 version of Yelp, or the listings on a web3 version of Airbnb.\n\n## But what will all of this look like? What should we expect to see?\n\n**Scams. Lots and lots of scams.**\n\nThere’s more to say, of course, but I wanted to get the most obvious prediction out of the way at the outset: we should predict a lot of scams. Beyond that, I’m unfortunately incapable of predicting the future. But I enjoy envisioning it as much as the next science fiction fan. Thankfully, I don’t think it’s going to be too difficult to predict what web3 will look like over the coming years, because, well, a lot of it is already here.\n\nIf you own any NFTs or tokens, you can connect your wallet to any number of different sites and apps and see and manipulate your tokens in different ways. Some applications are special purpose, only surfacing specific types of tokens, while others, like NFT marketplaces, are more general and let you see everything. Depending on where you are, you can perform different actions, or unlock unique features, all dependent on what you hold in your wallet.\n\nI believe this trend will only accelerate, evidenced by [Instagrams recent NFT features](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/instagram-testing-nfts-select-creators/). Applications and companies of all types will issue NFTs and tokens for a multitude of purposes. Some may be valuable generally, but most will probably be highly specific and valuable only to you. This idea that NFTs are inherently investment vehicles couldn’t be more wrong. Over time, we’ll start to think of our wallets the same way Ash Ketchum thought of his Pokédex. You’ll move through the internet, from service to service, collecting unique items you can carry with you that perform different functions. And to state the obvious: everything here is highly speculative. Don’t be surprised if these are wrong. With that said, here’s a non-comprehensive list of things we should reasonably expect to see over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n* When you use an app to work out, if you connect your wallet, [you’ll get badges and awards as NFTs](https://metaverse.joinladder.com/). When you connect your wallet to your Instagram, these awards can automatically display on your profile, or get posted to your story. When you decide to test out another fitness app, you’ll connect your wallet, and be suggested the appropriate workouts based on your fitness level.\n* You’ll go to a concert and get a unique, [limited addition attendance NFT](https://poap.xyz/) from the band, which you can immediately post to your favorite social media app. Later, when the same band releases their next album, they might decide to give everyone holding their live attendance NFTs early access. You’ll go to their site and connect your wallet and prove to them that you went to their concert. The benefit for the artist to do this via an NFT instead of some other more traditional method is they can release the tickets themselves without relying on a third party ticket system like Ticketmaster, and ensure that tickets in the future are authentic without managing and controlling the data themselves, or relying on another company doing it for them. \n* Using platforms like [Royal](https://royal.io/), musicians will tokenize their music allowing them to sell equity in their future earnings. They’ll sell a set number of tokens to investors and fans which capture a percentage of earnings from their music. By supporting your favorite artists, you’ll be able to take part in the upside of their success.\n* When you complete an online course and get a certificate, it’ll be issued as an NFT. You’ll connect your wallet to LinkedIn, and add the certificate to display on your profile. Now any time someone sees your profile they’ll see your certificate, and can easily click in to see who issued it and verify its authenticity.\n* When you buy a car or luxury watch, it will come with a proof of purchase and authenticity NFT. If you feel inclined to post a photo to Instagram (as so many do), you’ll post it along with the NFT, to give your content legitimacy. And when you decide to sell, you’ll post it online along with the NFT, to prove to people that they can trust that you do own the car, even if you’ve never sold anything before.\n* Currently, buying digital movies acts as a form of platform lock-in. We can imagine a different world where giant tech companies compete on the services they offer; when you buy a movie from Apple you could be given an NFT granting you the right to watch the movie on any streaming service. Apple would take a cut of the sale of course, but other platforms could compete with them, allowing you to move to different services taking your movies with you. And when the movie studio releases a new title, they can give discounts to everyone who owns one of their other movies. (I don’t believe the platforms are directly incentivized to do this one on their own, so I assume some external pressure would need to exist for this to be realized.)\n* When you play a video game, the items you pick up as you play the game will be issued as NFTs, and proof of their ownership will be capable of being brought with you outside of the game. Third-party apps will let you connect your wallet and verify the authenticity of your items, and allow you to do things with them on their external service, like trading and selling, all while ensuring that the original game creator takes a royalty on the sales. Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.\n* Your favorite charity will issue NFTs in exchange for your donations. Like the award NFTs given by the workout applications, you’ll be able to show off your charity donations on your social media profiles, simultaneously promoting your charity organization while signaling to your audience and friends. Charities will partner with other organizations and companies, offering special perks to their most philanthropic members. I heard this specific example as something that Sam Harris has wanted to do with one of his charities, however, I’m unaware of the status of the project.\n* Your favorite artist or content creator will release limited edition NFTs for their biggest fans. Ownership of one of these NFTs will give you special access to private groups where you get early access to content, and special access with the creator and other super fans. This will feel a lot like being part of a Patreon, with the important difference being that the content creator and their fans are untethered from any one specific platform. Currently, people who use Patreon are bound to it; they are under the total control of the platform. If they decide they no longer like Patreon, leaving isn’t an option, assuming they want to keep the majority of the fan base. NFT-based private groups change this. Anyone can build a platform that validates the NFTs owned by fans and allows them to come together as a private group. Each platform will compete on their UX and additional services they offer, instead of locking in creators and fans like we see today. If the content creator decides to move, everyone will be capable of transitioning seamlessly.\n* The NFTs that content creators sell online can be issued from special smart contracts that guarantee a % of future revenue made by the creator. This idea comes from a [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWTwcySGvrE) given by the head of Instagram, Adam Mosserri. At a basic level, the tokens sold by the content creators can act as equity in the creators' future earnings. As an example, a creator could sell 1,000 tokens, raising $100,000, in exchange for 10% of future earnings for the next 5 years. Platforms like Instagram, Youtube, etc. can read the smart contract and automatically distribute the revenue to the holders. Every time a check rolls in from Youtube, 90% goes to the content creator and 10% goes to the holders of their equity tokens. Every time the content creator signs up to a new platform, they’ll connect their wallet, allowing the new platform to automatically pick up the contract and execute it for any revenue that is made there.\n\nI could keep going. The examples I chose to present here are incredibly limited. But I hope you get the idea: what we can ultimately expect from web3, as I’ve presented, is the ability to generate or receive digital assets and objects which are capable of moving across the web seamlessly while maintaining their authenticity and history, without the need for issuers to stay in the loop or provide services to external parties who require authenticity. If I were to ever invoke the word “metaverse” it would be in regards to this very specific newly unlocked feature of the internet. It’s not about Facebook, specific mediums like AR or VR, or massive video game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite. The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using.\n\n## So, what problems does web3 solve?\n\n**Problem:** The data for {X} is under the total control of company {X}. If a user wants to migrate to a new service, they can’t bring their history with them in a way that retains its legitimacy. Company {X} doesn’t want to let them, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at scale in a way so {X} doesn’t maintain total control. See: Twitter API being public with companies built on it, only to be shut down by Twitter.\n\n**Solution:** Build an open immutable protocol and database that is not controlled by a single entity, like [Lens](https://lens.xyz/) and [ENS](http://ens.domains). The database and protocol will become the equivalent of a global utility, accessible and open to anyone for any purpose. Optional: release a governance token as a way to monetize and democratize control of the protocol.\n\n**Problem:** Real-world assets and certificates can’t be put online in a native way that allows them to be instantly validated, transferred, or used in any meaningful way. If I want to get a loan against my home or assets or prove to someone that I’m certified to do {X}, it won’t be as simple as clicking a button on a web form. The friction is too damn high.\n\n**Solution:** The entities that issue assets and certificates can issue NFTs that represent them. By looking at the issuer/history of an NFT and verifying their address or domain name, we can be confident that someone does own a specific asset regardless of what website we are using.\n\n**Problem:** Universal log-in, where you bring specific info with you to new apps and services, requires you to rely on a small number of giant tech companies - and the data you can bring with you is very limited and generally outside your control.\n\n**Solution:** [Private keys](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1389270115884097536)**,** [ENS](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1402388133086367751), and [Sign In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/).\n\n\n---\n\nI think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it.\n\nI think it might make the world more efficient if we were able to instantly verify the authenticity of assets, licenses, and certificates, without the need for every issuer to run massive APIs and authentication services. All one needs to do to ensure the authenticity of an asset is verify the identity and history of the issuer of its NFT.\n\nAnd I think it might make the internet better if we became less reliant on a handful of giant tech companies. Or, at the very least, it might be better if we were given the ability to walk away from them without the need to start again from zero.\n\n## What About the Critics?\n\nI don’t think there’s anything more divisive on the internet right now than web3, besides politics of course. There seems to be an unending number of [intelligent](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch) [people](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF) [who](https://twitter.com/liron) [believe](https://twitter.com/concodanomics) [that web3 is](https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin), [without doubt](https://twitter.com/davidgerard), [a giant scam](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/); that there isn’t a single redeeming quality about it. The bear market hasn’t exactly helped things. One of their main concerns is that web3 has almost certainly produced far more harm than not. You don’t have to [look far](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) to see hoards of people losing their life savings to a web3 Ponzi scheme. And on this specific point, I have to agree. Smart contracts are general purpose. And Ethereum is open and credibly neutral. Anyone can use it however they see fit. And unfortunately, the vast majority of builders are those who want to steal your money. However, it should be obvious that just because a technology has negative externalities doesn’t mean that we should discard the thing altogether. Their argument, if sound, would have to be that web3 only enables scams, and nothing else. As I’ve argued in this piece, I believe that because something like Ethereum is general purpose and credibly neutral, it enables anything to be built on top of it, both good and bad.\n\nThere are a lot of other issues people have with web3. There’s no way I’m going to be able to run through them all, for one because I agree with a lot of them, and also because there are just too many. However, I do want to tackle some of the most common that I see. A large majority of objections you’ll see are specifically for Bitcoin, like PoW mining, which I’m going to ignore, because, for the most part, I agree.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Just use a database. There’s nothing you need to use an NFT or blockchain for that you can’t do with a normal database.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Ethereum is a globally distributed computer that requires a scarce resource to run which it both creates and destroys as it is used. As a consequence of desiring to use the machine for any reason, we naturally find ourselves valuing the resource, which incentivizes others to run it and keep it alive. It’s this incredible property that gives us assurance that it’s going to be around for a long time. It’s a permanent database anyone can use, while no single entity is solely responsible for keeping it running. Anyone can plug into the database, check its’ state, and be confident that it’s accurate. This is fundamentally different than a traditional database and opens up a whole new world of opportunities. If I don’t want my digital objects to exist and persist outside of my involvement, or be capable of moving across the web without continuing to build special purpose integrations, then a normal database is perfect. However, there are cases where the ability to set and forget something, or ensure authenticity is continually preserved is desirable. I want to be able to add something to the chain, leave it there for 50 years, and come back knowing it hasn’t changed. Proof of ownership is an obvious candidate for this functionality.\n\n**OBJECTION:** To parrot [Liron](https://twitter.com/liron): no one will want any of this. You aren’t solving real problems.\n\n**RESPONSE:** In principle, we can use Ethereum to build anything. Granting the assumption that something like Ethereum is capable of sufficiently scaling in the coming years while remaining both trustworthy and general-purpose, we should believe that solving real problems is possible if they exist, and as I’ve argued, I believe they do.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Crypto is just a Ponzi scheme filled with more Ponzi schemes. There’s nothing real there worth paying attention to.\n\n**RESPONSE:** I agree that crypto is filled with Ponzi schemes and other horrible scams and nonsense. And while people may use crypto to solely build Ponzi schemes and nothing else, it seems reasonable to believe that non-Ponzi products are also possible. This is reasonable because just as we can easily point to [Scams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), we can also easily point to non-scams, like the no-loss lottery protocol [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), social protocols like [lens](https://lens.xyz/), the domain name service [ENS](http://ens.domains), and the borrowing and lending platforms [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/). Also, I think there’s an important distinction to be made between Layer one networks like Ethereum and the protocols and apps built on top of them. The Ethereum network is a global computer anyone can use to build protocols on. If everyone used Ethereum to build scams, it still wouldn’t mean that Ethereum itself is a Ponzi or scam, because the door would still be open for someone to build something useful on top of it.\n\n**OBJECTION:** [The Moxie Objection](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). One of the best criticisms I’ve seen has come from the CEO of Signal, Moxie, who makes a clear case for why we might not want to be so optimistic about this. The main claim that I want to focus on here is that web3 isn’t a great improvement from what we’ve seen before, because just like web2 is centralized around a handful of giant companies, like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, web3 isn’t doing any better. While it might look like you can use any wallet you want, and any app can plug directly into protocols on-chain, he says, behind the scenes, there are only one or two companies that everyone is plugging into. Everyone is using Infura and Alchemy to get data from the chain and using Opensea to pull NFT metadata. His takeaway and core criticism is that web3 is building centralizing forces even faster than we saw with web2.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Each centralizing force and entity he points to such as Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea, are not gatekeepers to the data on-chain. The state of the network is open for anyone to access, explore, and use as they please by simply running a node. What Moxie didn’t explain well is that Infura and alchemy simply run Ethereum nodes, which anyone can do, and then provides easy to use interfaces into them for developers. Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea can all be replaced easily and with little barrier to entry. Clients could decide tomorrow that they are no longer aligned with them, and pick new data providers without issue. If you try building with Infura or Alchemy, you’ll see that the interfaces are in fact quite primitive, and while we can expect them to improve, over the coming years we should expect new providers to come onto the scene who offer better services and interfaces into the Ethereum network. We can already see this happening with companies like [Moralis](https://moralis.io). This is not the case with any of the giant web2 companies. Their databases are closed off, and only accessible if you ask them for permission. If you get cut off, there’s no way for you to access the data. They are impossible to compete against let alone replace, because they act as gatekeepers to the data they collect, further locking users into their ecosystem.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of problems still open to be solved. But I have yet to see one that I believe is even likely to be insurmountable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTwitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols. And we know this, because we have real-world examples like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ENS](http://ens.domains), [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), [Lens](https://lens.xyz/), and many others.\n\n\n---\n\nMine is a single answer in a sea of others. There doesn’t seem to be much consensus on what web3 is, let alone what problems it will solve. It doesn’t help that people seem to have gone insane and come under a trance trading hyper-inflated cartoon images. My view is that web3 solves different problems for different people. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum are general-purpose, meaning the protocols and services that can be built on them are near-infinite, and what people will do with them is unpredictable, like trade cartoon JPEGs.\n\nPeople look at web3 and see the hyper-financialization of everything. And this is true; all on-chain assets can instantly be given their own stock market. They see cartoon apes trading for amounts that can only be explained by a world that has collectively lost its mind. And I don’t have good explanations for why that is, or what’s causing masses of people to lose touch with reality. However, if we put aside this [Problem With NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g)s, squint hard and look toward what we have unlocked beyond the insanity and hype, I believe we might see something real and historically important. The large-scale benefits are probably a little further down the road than I’m capable of predicting, but we might see a world that is made more [efficient by the replacement of trust in crumbling institutions and giant tech companies with cryptographic truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuvsLNCg-Y).\n\n*fin*\n\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: as you might have guessed, I’m kind of an Ethereum maximalist. I’ll probably write about why in another post.*", "timestamp": 1655695507, "digest": "-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg", "contributor": "0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D"}
{"id": "vTDqWLXOUwuIJpv3jh_iPXeE2GpoptT5zz6KM8zemaQ", "title": "What Problem Does Web3 Solve, Anyway?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zl272m8PrjRBlG02jbAeR.png?height=925&width=1055)\n\nI want to start this post off by stating that I have very little interest in freakishly expensive cartoon animal JPEGs, private Discord servers, or hexagon profile photos. When people think of web3, or look at what the “people in web3” are doing, outside of direct scams this is generally what they see. It looks as though the highest achievement of this third web is that the rich and famous have been given a new way to show everyone how disconnected they are from reality. And they are. I don’t have a lot of explanations for it, and while I too got caught up and enamored with expensive cartoons during the peak of the mania, I have no desire to rationalize any of it away. Instead, for this post, I want to look beyond it.\n\nMy view of web3 is that it offers an important unlock for software developers. It allows them to build and consume general-purpose, open, permanent protocols and APIs that are paid for by their consumers in real-time. These protocols and APIs provide a universal database that can be used by anyone. It allows for permanent, unique objects that can be taken anywhere across the internet without losing sight of their owners, creators, and history. If ape JPEGs are a terrible cartoon use case for this new unlock, what other real-world use cases might be more exciting?\n\nMost real-world web3 protocols and apps right now (that aren’t scams) are financial, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for trading assets, [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for getting yield on assets, and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) for borrowing and lending. At first glance, we might simply see new ways for degenerates to gamble. And we’d be right. If we change lenses, however, and simply look at what has been built we’ll see open protocols that anyone can build a frontend for without the need to ask for API keys. They can be incorporated into anything and remixed by anyone. And, if the promise of holds, they can't be shut down or their data corrupted.\n\nTo build other non-financial services at scale, we’re going to need to batch transactions saving users on insanely high transaction costs. [This is happening](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/), however, for the rest of this post, I want to ignore that. This post won’t talk about scaling solutions or different chains or throw obscure silly technical terms at you. Instead, I just want to answer the questions: “What problem does web3 solve, anyway? What will it look like?”\n\n[Web3, Explained](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1535377548388945920)\n\n> *TL;DR: Web3 offers a general-purpose way to represent ownership of data, assets, and certificates that maintain their authenticity, history, and ownership state across the web.*\n\n## The Limits of Web2\n\nAsset titles, licenses, and certificates can't live on the internet easily in a truly meaningful and native way. If you do put them online, there’s very little one can do to ensure they are authentic or valid, especially if you want them to remain authentic across platforms without building special-purpose APIs and integrations. Allowing their ownership and control to be easily transferred between different people and applications is also not trivial.\n\nIf you graduated from Harvard and you want this achievement displayed on some online profile in a way that can be easily verified, Harvard would need to build and host an API that exposes their alumni list mapped to user accounts in their database, as well as a way for apps to authenticate their users to ensure that they are who they say they are. And Harvard would need to pay a full-time team to maintain these services. And all the apps that want to get this data would need to create a developer account with the Harvard Web Services and get an API key to ensure they don't spam the service. Assuming that anyone would want this for any reason, it’s entirely infeasible and almost certainly not worth the effort.\n\nInstead, we can simplify the entire thing by schools issuing an NFT to students. So long as an app/user knows the Harvard crypto address or domain name, they can verify that someone does have a real degree from Harvard, and it will work as well as someone’s ability to currently verify that someone has a “real ape NFT”. The amount of effort this would take is trivial.\n\nExpand this Harvard example, which is incredibly general, to certificates and licenses in general. Companies want to build applications connecting licensed individuals who hold certificates with their clients, while removing manual verifications and minimizing fake accounts. NFTs allow us to do this without requiring issuers to build and maintain specialized APIs and integrations on a case by case basis.\n\nAs far as I can tell, bringing real-world assets and certificates online in a truly native way is incredibly powerful. Currently, if you are issued a certificate that says you are licensed to do {X}, the certificate can only be brought online within the confines of the issuer. You have to log onto their website/app to see any version that other people will trust. If other applications or people want to verify it outside of their site, the issuer has to build an API and service allowing you to authenticate yourself and verify it. the issuer has to host, serve, and control the certificate, and there’s no way for you to take control of it and bring it with you anywhere you want online, without each platform building special-purpose integrations for you. Instead, if a certificate issuer gives you an NFT representing your certificate, you can bring it with you anywhere so long as you can connect your wallet. Your real-estate, hairdressing, law, financial advisor, etc. licenses can all be posted to the top of your Instagram page automatically, allowing anyone to trivially check who issued it and verify its authenticity. All that is required is that you connect your wallet.\n\nBased on many conversions I’ve had, people seem to be easily confused by this concept. “What makes one NFT authentic and others not?”, they ask. “Anyone can create an NFT of anything. I can create an NFT that looks exactly like all of the other real-estate licenses and post it to my Instagram. Who’s to say mine is fake? How would anyone know?” The answer is identity and provenance.\n\nFor something to be considered authentic, we need to know where it came from. In the art world, this concept is known as provenance, and NFTs give us perfect provenance. When I look at the real-estate license NFT on your Instagram account, I’ll be able to click into it and see its token ID, the contract/collection it belongs to, and who issued it. And if it wasn’t issued by NMLS, then I can be near certain that it’s a fake. If I’m feeling extra suspicious, I can open a second application like Etherscan and confirm. I’ll be able to see that you issued it to yourself. The same applies to Nike shoes, art, home titles, etc. If Instagram were so inclined, it could choose to control a list of verified wallets, so that NFTs issued by NMLS and Nike would automatically show a check mark, while others wouldn’t.\n\n## Extending Web2\n\nYelp owns all of the restaurant reviews instead of restaurants and reviewers. If someone wants to compete with Yelp they have to start from scratch. If a restaurant decides they don’t like yelp anymore, they can’t easily take their reviews to a new app or platform without the reviews losing their credibility.\n\nIn contrast, when I build an app or website today I sit on the shoulders of giants. I have a seemingly infinite number of code packages, libraries, snippets, and APIs available to me, and I can use all of these tools to help me build things faster. I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I start a new project. However, if I want to build a competitor to Yelp, again, there is one major area where I have to start from scratch: the data and user base. Even if I scraped Yelp and ported all of their reviews, there’s no reason anyone should assume that the reviews are authentic, because they’ve been disconnected from their creators' accounts.\n\nA web3 version of Yelp, if it lives up to its promise, takes the data and infrastructure and makes it available to anyone while not being under the control of any single entity. Any developer can build a new UI for it. Instead of restaurants and users being tied down to one company, they are free to pick and choose whichever apps they please that connect to open protocols. We would no longer have a single company called Yelp. We would instead have an open and permanent protocol and database, and a potentially infinite number of Yelp competitors connected to it, all sharing the same data. Instead of competing with each other on who can hoard the most data, they would compete on their user experiences and services.\n\nYelp is a pretty inconsequential example. We can apply the same logic to public transportation networks like Uber and Lyft, or services like Airbnb, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, GoodReads, or your Twitter social graph.\n\nAs an Airbnb host, you can’t move platforms easily without losing the credibility of your reviews. you might have spent years building your review score, but now are stuck with a company that continues to increase their take rate, when you want desperately to move to a new platform. If both your listing and it’s reviews were on a neutral protocol similar in kind to something like [@LensProtocol](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol), you could seamlessly move to any competitor also building on the same protocol. In fact, you could exist on all platforms built on the same protocol simultaneously.\n\nOn Twitter, @liron [argues](https://twitter.com/liron/status/1531825233132277760) that the non-existence of a web3 Airbnb is evidence that not only is the project infeasible now but that almost nothing of value can be built here. And he’s right that none of these examples exist yet, but it doesn’t seem to me that we should assume they are impossible in principle. One example we can look at to confirm this is [ENS](http://ens.domains): all of the rules, domains and associated data live on the Ethereum blockchain. Any app can plug directly into the protocol and build their own services around it. People are doing this by building ENS specific [tools](https://ens.tools/domains) and no-fee [marketplaces](https://twitter.com/kodexapp). The Rainbow mobile app is doing this by allowing their users to [register ENS domains](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1536804795075502080) directly in their app. Any app ([and there are many](https://ens.domains/#home-ecosystem)) can pull the ENS data automatically and verify that a wallet owns a specific domain without needing to ask for permission. Granting the assumption that Ethereum is capable of scaling, there’s no difference between the domain names on ENS and the restaurant reviews on a hypothetical web3 version of Yelp, or the listings on a web3 version of Airbnb.\n\n## But what will all of this look like? What should we expect to see?\n\n**Scams. Lots and lots of scams.**\n\nThere’s more to say, of course, but I wanted to get the most obvious prediction out of the way at the outset: we should predict a lot of scams. Beyond that, I’m unfortunately incapable of predicting the future. But I enjoy envisioning it as much as the next science fiction fan. Thankfully, I don’t think it’s going to be too difficult to predict what web3 will look like over the coming years, because, well, a lot of it is already here.\n\nIf you own any NFTs or tokens, you can connect your wallet to any number of different sites and apps and see and manipulate your tokens in different ways. Some applications are special purpose, only surfacing specific types of tokens, while others, like NFT marketplaces, are more general and let you see everything. Depending on where you are, you can perform different actions, or unlock unique features, all dependent on what you hold in your wallet.\n\nI believe this trend will only accelerate, evidenced by [Instagrams recent NFT features](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/instagram-testing-nfts-select-creators/). Applications and companies of all types will issue NFTs and tokens for a multitude of purposes. Some may be valuable generally, but most will probably be highly specific and valuable only to you. This idea that NFTs are inherently investment vehicles couldn’t be more wrong. Over time, we’ll start to think of our wallets the same way Ash Ketchum thought of his Pokédex. You’ll move through the internet, from service to service, collecting unique items you can carry with you that perform different functions. And to state the obvious: everything here is highly speculative. Don’t be surprised if these are wrong. With that said, here’s a non-comprehensive list of things we should reasonably expect to see over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n* When you use an app to work out, if you connect your wallet, [you’ll get badges and awards as NFTs](https://metaverse.joinladder.com/). When you connect your wallet to your Instagram, these awards can automatically display on your profile, or get posted to your story. When you decide to test out another fitness app, you’ll connect your wallet, and be suggested the appropriate workouts based on your fitness level.\n* You’ll go to a concert and get a unique, [limited addition attendance NFT](https://poap.xyz/) from the band, which you can immediately post to your favorite social media app. Later, when the same band releases their next album, they might decide to give everyone holding their live attendance NFTs early access. You’ll go to their site and connect your wallet and prove to them that you went to their concert. The benefit for the artist to do this via an NFT instead of some other more traditional method is they can release the tickets themselves without relying on a third party ticket system like Ticketmaster, and ensure that tickets in the future are authentic without managing and controlling the data themselves, or relying on another company doing it for them. \n* Using platforms like [Royal](https://royal.io/), musicians will tokenize their music allowing them to sell equity in their future earnings. They’ll sell a set number of tokens to investors and fans which capture a percentage of earnings from their music. By supporting your favorite artists, you’ll be able to take part in the upside of their success.\n* When you complete an online course and get a certificate, it’ll be issued as an NFT. You’ll connect your wallet to LinkedIn, and add the certificate to display on your profile. Now any time someone sees your profile they’ll see your certificate, and can easily click in to see who issued it and verify its authenticity.\n* When you buy a car or luxury watch, it will come with a proof of purchase and authenticity NFT. If you feel inclined to post a photo to Instagram (as so many do), you’ll post it along with the NFT, to give your content legitimacy. And when you decide to sell, you’ll post it online along with the NFT, to prove to people that they can trust that you do own the car, even if you’ve never sold anything before.\n* Currently, buying digital movies acts as a form of platform lock-in. We can imagine a different world where giant tech companies compete on the services they offer; when you buy a movie from Apple you could be given an NFT granting you the right to watch the movie on any streaming service. Apple would take a cut of the sale of course, but other platforms could compete with them, allowing you to move to different services taking your movies with you. And when the movie studio releases a new title, they can give discounts to everyone who owns one of their other movies. (I don’t believe the platforms are directly incentivized to do this one on their own, so I assume some external pressure would need to exist for this to be realized.)\n* When you play a video game, the items you pick up as you play the game will be issued as NFTs, and proof of their ownership will be capable of being brought with you outside of the game. Third-party apps will let you connect your wallet and verify the authenticity of your items, and allow you to do things with them on their external service, like trading and selling, all while ensuring that the original game creator takes a royalty on the sales. Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.\n* Your favorite charity will issue NFTs in exchange for your donations. Like the award NFTs given by the workout applications, you’ll be able to show off your charity donations on your social media profiles, simultaneously promoting your charity organization while signaling to your audience and friends. Charities will partner with other organizations and companies, offering special perks to their most philanthropic members. I heard this specific example as something that Sam Harris has wanted to do with one of his charities, however, I’m unaware of the status of the project.\n* Your favorite artist or content creator will release limited edition NFTs for their biggest fans. Ownership of one of these NFTs will give you special access to private groups where you get early access to content, and special access with the creator and other super fans. This will feel a lot like being part of a Patreon, with the important difference being that the content creator and their fans are untethered from any one specific platform. Currently, people who use Patreon are bound to it; they are under the total control of the platform. If they decide they no longer like Patreon, leaving isn’t an option, assuming they want to keep the majority of the fan base. NFT-based private groups change this. Anyone can build a platform that validates the NFTs owned by fans and allows them to come together as a private group. Each platform will compete on their UX and additional services they offer, instead of locking in creators and fans like we see today. If the content creator decides to move, everyone will be capable of transitioning seamlessly.\n* The NFTs that content creators sell online can be issued from special smart contracts that guarantee a % of future revenue made by the creator. This idea comes from a [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWTwcySGvrE) given by the head of Instagram, Adam Mosserri. At a basic level, the tokens sold by the content creators can act as equity in the creators' future earnings. As an example, a creator could sell 1,000 tokens, raising $100,000, in exchange for 10% of future earnings for the next 5 years. Platforms like Instagram, Youtube, etc. can read the smart contract and automatically distribute the revenue to the holders. Every time a check rolls in from Youtube, 90% goes to the content creator and 10% goes to the holders of their equity tokens. Every time the content creator signs up to a new platform, they’ll connect their wallet, allowing the new platform to automatically pick up the contract and execute it for any revenue that is made there.\n\nI could keep going. The examples I chose to present here are incredibly limited. But I hope you get the idea: what we can ultimately expect from web3, as I’ve presented, is the ability to generate or receive digital assets and objects which are capable of moving across the web seamlessly while maintaining their authenticity and history, without the need for issuers to stay in the loop or provide services to external parties who require authenticity. If I were to ever invoke the word “metaverse” it would be in regards to this very specific newly unlocked feature of the internet. It’s not about Facebook, specific mediums like AR or VR, or massive video game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite. The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using.\n\n## So, what problems does web3 solve?\n\n**Problem:** The data for {X} is under the total control of company {X}. If a user wants to migrate to a new service, they can’t bring their history with them in a way that retains its legitimacy. Company {X} doesn’t want to let them, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at scale in a way so {X} doesn’t maintain total control. See: Twitter API being public with companies built on it, only to be shut down by Twitter.\n\n**Solution:** Build an open immutable protocol and database that is not controlled by a single entity, like [Lens](https://lens.xyz/) and [ENS](http://ens.domains). The database and protocol will become the equivalent of a global utility, accessible and open to anyone for any purpose. Optional: release a governance token as a way to monetize and democratize control of the protocol.\n\n**Problem:** Real-world assets and certificates can’t be put online in a native way that allows them to be instantly validated, transferred, or used in any meaningful way. If I want to get a loan against my home or assets or prove to someone that I’m certified to do {X}, it won’t be as simple as clicking a button on a web form. The friction is too damn high.\n\n**Solution:** The entities that issue assets and certificates can issue NFTs that represent them. By looking at the issuer/history of an NFT and verifying their address or domain name, we can be confident that someone does own a specific asset regardless of what website we are using.\n\n**Problem:** Universal log-in, where you bring specific info with you to new apps and services, requires you to rely on a small number of giant tech companies - and the data you can bring with you is very limited and generally outside your control.\n\n**Solution:** [Private keys](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1389270115884097536)**,** [ENS](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1402388133086367751), and [Sign In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/).\n\n\n---\n\nI think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it.\n\nI think it might make the world more efficient if we were able to instantly verify the authenticity of assets, licenses, and certificates, without the need for every issuer to run massive APIs and authentication services. All one needs to do to ensure the authenticity of an asset is verify the identity and history of the issuer of its NFT.\n\nAnd I think it might make the internet better if we became less reliant on a handful of giant tech companies. Or, at the very least, it might be better if we were given the ability to walk away from them without the need to start again from zero.\n\n## What About the Critics?\n\nI don’t think there’s anything more divisive on the internet right now than web3, besides politics of course. There seems to be an unending number of [intelligent](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch) [people](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF) [who](https://twitter.com/liron) [believe](https://twitter.com/concodanomics) [that web3 is](https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin), [without doubt](https://twitter.com/davidgerard), [a giant scam](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/); that there isn’t a single redeeming quality about it. The bear market hasn’t exactly helped things. One of their main concerns is that web3 has almost certainly produced far more harm than not. You don’t have to [look far](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) to see hoards of people losing their life savings to a web3 Ponzi scheme. And on this specific point, I have to agree. Smart contracts are general purpose. And Ethereum is open and credibly neutral. Anyone can use it however they see fit. And unfortunately, the vast majority of builders are those who want to steal your money. However, it should be obvious that just because a technology has negative externalities doesn’t mean that we should discard the thing altogether. Their argument, if sound, would have to be that web3 only enables scams, and nothing else. As I’ve argued in this piece, I believe that because something like Ethereum is general purpose and credibly neutral, it enables anything to be built on top of it, both good and bad.\n\nThere are a lot of other issues people have with web3. There’s no way I’m going to be able to run through them all, for one because I agree with a lot of them, and also because there are just too many. However, I do want to tackle some of the most common that I see. A large majority of objections you’ll see are specifically for Bitcoin, like PoW mining, which I’m going to ignore, because, for the most part, I agree.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Just use a database. There’s nothing you need to use an NFT or blockchain for that you can’t do with a normal database.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Ethereum is a globally distributed computer that requires a scarce resource to run which it both creates and destroys as it is used. As a consequence of desiring to use the machine for any reason, we naturally find ourselves valuing the resource, which incentivizes others to run it and keep it alive. It’s this incredible property that gives us assurance that it’s going to be around for a long time. It’s a permanent database anyone can use, while no single entity is solely responsible for keeping it running. Anyone can plug into the database, check its’ state, and be confident that it’s accurate. This is fundamentally different than a traditional database and opens up a whole new world of opportunities. If I don’t want my digital objects to exist and persist outside of my involvement, or be capable of moving across the web without continuing to build special purpose integrations, then a normal database is perfect. However, there are cases where the ability to set and forget something, or ensure authenticity is continually preserved is desirable. I want to be able to add something to the chain, leave it there for 50 years, and come back knowing it hasn’t changed. Proof of ownership is an obvious candidate for this functionality.\n\n**OBJECTION:** To parrot [Liron](https://twitter.com/liron): no one will want any of this. You aren’t solving real problems.\n\n**RESPONSE:** In principle, we can use Ethereum to build anything. Granting the assumption that something like Ethereum is capable of sufficiently scaling in the coming years while remaining both trustworthy and general-purpose, we should believe that solving real problems is possible if they exist, and as I’ve argued, I believe they do.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Crypto is just a Ponzi scheme filled with more Ponzi schemes. There’s nothing real there worth paying attention to.\n\n**RESPONSE:** I agree that crypto is filled with Ponzi schemes and other horrible scams and nonsense. And while people may use crypto to solely build Ponzi schemes and nothing else, it seems reasonable to believe that non-Ponzi products are also possible. This is reasonable because just as we can easily point to [Scams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), we can also easily point to non-scams, like the no-loss lottery protocol [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), social protocols like [lens](https://lens.xyz/), the domain name service [ENS](http://ens.domains), and the borrowing and lending platforms [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/). Also, I think there’s an important distinction to be made between Layer one networks like Ethereum and the protocols and apps built on top of them. The Ethereum network is a global computer anyone can use to build protocols on. If everyone used Ethereum to build scams, it still wouldn’t mean that Ethereum itself is a Ponzi or scam, because the door would still be open for someone to build something useful on top of it.\n\n**OBJECTION:** [The Moxie Objection](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). One of the best criticisms I’ve seen has come from the CEO of Signal, Moxie, who makes a clear case for why we might not want to be so optimistic about this. The main claim that I want to focus on here is that web3 isn’t a great improvement from what we’ve seen before, because just like web2 is centralized around a handful of giant companies, like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, web3 isn’t doing any better. While it might look like you can use any wallet you want, and any app can plug directly into protocols on-chain, he says, behind the scenes, there are only one or two companies that everyone is plugging into. Everyone is using Infura and Alchemy to get data from the chain and using Opensea to pull NFT metadata. His takeaway and core criticism is that web3 is building centralizing forces even faster than we saw with web2.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Each centralizing force and entity he points to such as Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea, are not gatekeepers to the data on-chain. The state of the network is open for anyone to access, explore, and use as they please by simply running a node. What Moxie didn’t explain well is that Infura and alchemy simply run Ethereum nodes, which anyone can do, and then provides easy to use interfaces into them for developers. Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea can all be replaced easily and with little barrier to entry. Clients could decide tomorrow that they are no longer aligned with them, and pick new data providers without issue. If you try building with Infura or Alchemy, you’ll see that the interfaces are in fact quite primitive, and while we can expect them to improve, over the coming years we should expect new providers to come onto the scene who offer better services and interfaces into the Ethereum network. We can already see this happening with companies like [Moralis](https://moralis.io). This is not the case with any of the giant web2 companies. Their databases are closed off, and only accessible if you ask them for permission. If you get cut off, there’s no way for you to access the data. They are impossible to compete against let alone replace, because they act as gatekeepers to the data they collect, further locking users into their ecosystem.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of problems still open to be solved. But I have yet to see one that I believe is even likely to be insurmountable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTwitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols. And we know this, because we have real-world examples like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ENS](http://ens.domains), [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), [Lens](https://lens.xyz/), and many others.\n\n\n---\n\nMine is a single answer in a sea of others. There doesn’t seem to be much consensus on what web3 is, let alone what problems it will solve. It doesn’t help that people seem to have gone insane and come under a trance trading hyper-inflated cartoon images. My view is that web3 solves different problems for different people. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum are general-purpose, meaning the protocols and services that can be built on them are near-infinite, and what people will do with them is unpredictable, like trade cartoon JPEGs.\n\nPeople look at web3 and see the hyper-financialization of everything. And this is true; all on-chain assets can instantly be given their own stock market. They see cartoon apes trading for amounts that can only be explained by a world that has collectively lost its mind. And I don’t have good explanations for why that is, or what’s causing masses of people to lose touch with reality. However, if we put aside this [Problem With NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g)s, squint hard and look toward what we have unlocked beyond the insanity and hype, I believe we might see something real and historically important. The large-scale benefits are probably a little further down the road than I’m capable of predicting, but we might see a world that is made more [efficient by the replacement of trust in crumbling institutions and giant tech companies with cryptographic truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuvsLNCg-Y).\n\n*fin*\n\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: as you might have guessed, I’m kind of an Ethereum maximalist.

When people think of web3, or look at what the “people in web3” are doing, outside of direct scams this is generally what they see. It looks as though the highest achievement of this third web is that the rich and famous have been given a new way to show everyone how disconnected they are from reality. And they are. I don’t have a lot of explanations for it, and while I too got caught up and enamored with expensive cartoons during the peak of the mania, I have no desire to rationalize any of it away. Instead, for this post, I want to look beyond it.\n\nMy view of web3 is that it offers an important unlock for software developers. It allows them to build and consume general-purpose, open, permanent protocols and APIs that are paid for by their consumers in real-time. These protocols and APIs provide a universal database that can be used by anyone. It allows for permanent, unique objects that can be taken anywhere across the internet without losing sight of their owners, creators, and history. If ape JPEGs are a terrible cartoon use case for this new unlock, what other real-world use cases might be more exciting?\n\nMost real-world web3 protocols and apps right now (that aren’t scams) are financial, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for trading assets, [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for getting yield on assets, and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) for borrowing and lending. At first glance, we might simply see new ways for degenerates to gamble. And we’d be right. If we change lenses, however, and simply look at what has been built we’ll see open protocols that anyone can build a frontend for without the need to ask for API keys. They can be incorporated into anything and remixed by anyone. And, if the promise of holds, they can't be shut down or their data corrupted.\n\nTo build other non-financial services at scale, we’re going to need to batch transactions saving users on insanely high transaction costs. [This is happening](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/), however, for the rest of this post, I want to ignore that. This post won’t talk about scaling solutions or different chains or throw obscure silly technical terms at you. Instead, I just want to answer the questions: “What problem does web3 solve, anyway? What will it look like?”\n\n[Web3, Explained](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1535377548388945920)\n\n> *TL;DR: Web3 offers a general-purpose way to represent ownership of data, assets, and certificates that maintain their authenticity, history, and ownership state across the web.*\n\n## The Limits of Web2\n\nAsset titles, licenses, and certificates can't live on the internet easily in a truly meaningful and native way. If you do put them online, there’s very little one can do to ensure they are authentic or valid, especially if you want them to remain authentic across platforms without building special-purpose APIs and integrations. Allowing their ownership and control to be easily transferred between different people and applications is also not trivial.\n\nIf you graduated from Harvard and you want this achievement displayed on some online profile in a way that can be easily verified, Harvard would need to build and host an API that exposes their alumni list mapped to user accounts in their database, as well as a way for apps to authenticate their users to ensure that they are who they say they are. And Harvard would need to pay a full-time team to maintain these services. And all the apps that want to get this data would need to create a developer account with the Harvard Web Services and get an API key to ensure they don't spam the service. Assuming that anyone would want this for any reason, it’s entirely infeasible and almost certainly not worth the effort.\n\nInstead, we can simplify the entire thing by schools issuing an NFT to students. So long as an app/user knows the Harvard crypto address or domain name, they can verify that someone does have a real degree from Harvard, and it will work as well as someone’s ability to currently verify that someone has a “real ape NFT”. The amount of effort this would take is trivial.\n\nExpand this Harvard example, which is incredibly general, to certificates and licenses in general. Companies want to build applications connecting licensed individuals who hold certificates with their clients, while removing manual verifications and minimizing fake accounts. NFTs allow us to do this without requiring issuers to build and maintain specialized APIs and integrations on a case by case basis.\n\nAs far as I can tell, bringing real-world assets and certificates online in a truly native way is incredibly powerful. Currently, if you are issued a certificate that says you are licensed to do {X}, the certificate can only be brought online within the confines of the issuer. You have to log onto their website/app to see any version that other people will trust. If other applications or people want to verify it outside of their site, the issuer has to build an API and service allowing you to authenticate yourself and verify it. the issuer has to host, serve, and control the certificate, and there’s no way for you to take control of it and bring it with you anywhere you want online, without each platform building special-purpose integrations for you. Instead, if a certificate issuer gives you an NFT representing your certificate, you can bring it with you anywhere so long as you can connect your wallet. Your real-estate, hairdressing, law, financial advisor, etc. licenses can all be posted to the top of your Instagram page automatically, allowing anyone to trivially check who issued it and verify its authenticity. All that is required is that you connect your wallet.\n\nBased on many conversions I’ve had, people seem to be easily confused by this concept. “What makes one NFT authentic and others not?”, they ask. “Anyone can create an NFT of anything. I can create an NFT that looks exactly like all of the other real-estate licenses and post it to my Instagram. Who’s to say mine is fake? How would anyone know?” The answer is identity and provenance.\n\nFor something to be considered authentic, we need to know where it came from. In the art world, this concept is known as provenance, and NFTs give us perfect provenance. When I look at the real-estate license NFT on your Instagram account, I’ll be able to click into it and see its token ID, the contract/collection it belongs to, and who issued it. And if it wasn’t issued by NMLS, then I can be near certain that it’s a fake. If I’m feeling extra suspicious, I can open a second application like Etherscan and confirm. I’ll be able to see that you issued it to yourself. The same applies to Nike shoes, art, home titles, etc. If Instagram were so inclined, it could choose to control a list of verified wallets, so that NFTs issued by NMLS and Nike would automatically show a check mark, while others wouldn’t.\n\n## Extending Web2\n\nYelp owns all of the restaurant reviews instead of restaurants and reviewers. If someone wants to compete with Yelp they have to start from scratch. If a restaurant decides they don’t like yelp anymore, they can’t easily take their reviews to a new app or platform without the reviews losing their credibility.\n\nIn contrast, when I build an app or website today I sit on the shoulders of giants. I have a seemingly infinite number of code packages, libraries, snippets, and APIs available to me, and I can use all of these tools to help me build things faster. I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I start a new project. However, if I want to build a competitor to Yelp, again, there is one major area where I have to start from scratch: the data and user base. Even if I scraped Yelp and ported all of their reviews, there’s no reason anyone should assume that the reviews are authentic, because they’ve been disconnected from their creators' accounts.\n\nA web3 version of Yelp, if it lives up to its promise, takes the data and infrastructure and makes it available to anyone while not being under the control of any single entity. Any developer can build a new UI for it. Instead of restaurants and users being tied down to one company, they are free to pick and choose whichever apps they please that connect to open protocols. We would no longer have a single company called Yelp. We would instead have an open and permanent protocol and database, and a potentially infinite number of Yelp competitors connected to it, all sharing the same data. Instead of competing with each other on who can hoard the most data, they would compete on their user experiences and services.\n\nYelp is a pretty inconsequential example. We can apply the same logic to public transportation networks like Uber and Lyft, or services like Airbnb, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, GoodReads, or your Twitter social graph.\n\nAs an Airbnb host, you can’t move platforms easily without losing the credibility of your reviews. you might have spent years building your review score, but now are stuck with a company that continues to increase their take rate, when you want desperately to move to a new platform. If both your listing and it’s reviews were on a neutral protocol similar in kind to something like [@LensProtocol](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol), you could seamlessly move to any competitor also building on the same protocol. In fact, you could exist on all platforms built on the same protocol simultaneously.\n\nOn Twitter, @liron [argues](https://twitter.com/liron/status/1531825233132277760) that the non-existence of a web3 Airbnb is evidence that not only is the project infeasible now but that almost nothing of value can be built here. And he’s right that none of these examples exist yet, but it doesn’t seem to me that we should assume they are impossible in principle. One example we can look at to confirm this is [ENS](http://ens.domains): all of the rules, domains and associated data live on the Ethereum blockchain. Any app can plug directly into the protocol and build their own services around it. People are doing this by building ENS specific [tools](https://ens.tools/domains) and no-fee [marketplaces](https://twitter.com/kodexapp). The Rainbow mobile app is doing this by allowing their users to [register ENS domains](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1536804795075502080) directly in their app. Any app ([and there are many](https://ens.domains/#home-ecosystem)) can pull the ENS data automatically and verify that a wallet owns a specific domain without needing to ask for permission. Granting the assumption that Ethereum is capable of scaling, there’s no difference between the domain names on ENS and the restaurant reviews on a hypothetical web3 version of Yelp, or the listings on a web3 version of Airbnb.\n\n## But what will all of this look like? What should we expect to see?\n\n**Scams. Lots and lots of scams.**\n\nThere’s more to say, of course, but I wanted to get the most obvious prediction out of the way at the outset: we should predict a lot of scams. Beyond that, I’m unfortunately incapable of predicting the future. But I enjoy envisioning it as much as the next science fiction fan. Thankfully, I don’t think it’s going to be too difficult to predict what web3 will look like over the coming years, because, well, a lot of it is already here.\n\nIf you own any NFTs or tokens, you can connect your wallet to any number of different sites and apps and see and manipulate your tokens in different ways. Some applications are special purpose, only surfacing specific types of tokens, while others, like NFT marketplaces, are more general and let you see everything. Depending on where you are, you can perform different actions, or unlock unique features, all dependent on what you hold in your wallet.\n\nI believe this trend will only accelerate, evidenced by [Instagrams recent NFT features](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/instagram-testing-nfts-select-creators/). Applications and companies of all types will issue NFTs and tokens for a multitude of purposes. Some may be valuable generally, but most will probably be highly specific and valuable only to you. This idea that NFTs are inherently investment vehicles couldn’t be more wrong. Over time, we’ll start to think of our wallets the same way Ash Ketchum thought of his Pokédex. You’ll move through the internet, from service to service, collecting unique items you can carry with you that perform different functions. And to state the obvious: everything here is highly speculative. Don’t be surprised if these are wrong. With that said, here’s a non-comprehensive list of things we should reasonably expect to see over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n* When you use an app to work out, if you connect your wallet, [you’ll get badges and awards as NFTs](https://metaverse.joinladder.com/). When you connect your wallet to your Instagram, these awards can automatically display on your profile, or get posted to your story. When you decide to test out another fitness app, you’ll connect your wallet, and be suggested the appropriate workouts based on your fitness level.\n* You’ll go to a concert and get a unique, [limited addition attendance NFT](https://poap.xyz/) from the band, which you can immediately post to your favorite social media app. Later, when the same band releases their next album, they might decide to give everyone holding their live attendance NFTs early access. You’ll go to their site and connect your wallet and prove to them that you went to their concert. The benefit for the artist to do this via an NFT instead of some other more traditional method is they can release the tickets themselves without relying on a third party ticket system like Ticketmaster. They can do this while ensuring that tickets in the future are authentic without managing and controlling the data themselves, or relying on another company doing it for them. \n* Using platforms like [Royal](https://royal.io/), musicians will tokenize their music allowing them to sell equity in their future earnings. They’ll sell a set number of tokens to investors and fans which capture a percentage of earnings from their music. By supporting your favorite artists, you’ll be able to take part in the upside of their success.\n* When you complete an online course and get a certificate, it’ll be issued as an NFT. You’ll connect your wallet to LinkedIn, and add the certificate to display on your profile. Now any time someone sees your profile they’ll see your certificate, and can easily click in to see who issued it and verify its authenticity.\n* When you buy a car or luxury watch, it will come with a proof of purchase and authenticity NFT. If you feel inclined to post a photo to Instagram (as so many do), you’ll post it along with the NFT, to give your content legitimacy. And when you decide to sell, you’ll post it online along with the NFT, to prove to people that they can trust that you do own the car, even if you’ve never sold anything before.\n* Currently, buying digital movies acts as a form of platform lock-in. We can imagine a different world where giant tech companies compete on the services they offer; when you buy a movie from Apple you could be given an NFT granting you the right to watch the movie on any streaming service. Apple would take a cut of the sale of course, but other platforms could compete with them, allowing you to move to different services taking your movies with you. And when the movie studio releases a new title, they can give discounts to everyone who owns one of their other movies. (I don’t believe the platforms are directly incentivized to do this one on their own, so I assume some external pressure would need to exist for this to be realized.)\n* When you play a video game, the items you pick up as you play the game will be issued as NFTs, and proof of their ownership will be capable of being brought with you outside of the game. Third-party apps will let you connect your wallet and verify the authenticity of your items, and allow you to do things with them on their external service, like trading and selling, all while ensuring that the original game creator takes a royalty on the sales. Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.\n* Your favorite charity will issue NFTs in exchange for your donations. Like the award NFTs given by the workout applications, you’ll be able to show off your charity donations on your social media profiles, simultaneously promoting your charity organization while signaling to your audience and friends. Charities will partner with other organizations and companies, offering special perks to their most philanthropic members. I heard this specific example as something that Sam Harris has wanted to do with one of his charities, however, I’m unaware of the status of the project.\n* Your favorite artist or content creator will release limited edition NFTs for their biggest fans. Ownership of one of these NFTs will give you special access to private groups where you get early access to content, and special access with the creator and other super fans. This will feel a lot like being part of a Patreon, with the important difference being that the content creator and their fans are untethered from any one specific platform. Currently, people who use Patreon are bound to it; they are under the total control of the platform. If they decide they no longer like Patreon, leaving isn’t an option, assuming they want to keep the majority of the fan base. NFT-based private groups change this. Anyone can build a platform that validates the NFTs owned by fans and allows them to come together as a private group. Each platform will compete on their UX and additional services they offer, instead of locking in creators and fans like we see today. If the content creator decides to move, everyone will be capable of transitioning seamlessly.\n* The NFTs that content creators sell online can be issued from special smart contracts that guarantee a % of future revenue made by the creator. This idea comes from a [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWTwcySGvrE) given by the head of Instagram, Adam Mosserri. At a basic level, the tokens sold by the content creators can act as equity in the creators' future earnings. As an example, a creator could sell 1,000 tokens, raising $100,000, in exchange for 10% of future earnings for the next 5 years. Platforms like Instagram, Youtube, etc. can read the smart contract and automatically distribute the revenue to the holders. Every time a check rolls in from Youtube, 90% goes to the content creator and 10% goes to the holders of their equity tokens. Every time the content creator signs up to a new platform, they’ll connect their wallet, allowing the new platform to automatically pick up the contract and execute it for any revenue that is made there.\n\nI could keep going. The examples I chose to present here are incredibly limited. But I hope you get the idea: what we can ultimately expect from web3, as I’ve presented, is the ability to generate or receive digital assets and objects which are capable of moving across the web seamlessly while maintaining their authenticity and history, without the need for issuers to stay in the loop or provide services to external parties who require authenticity. If I were to ever invoke the word “metaverse” it would be in regards to this very specific newly unlocked feature of the internet. It’s not about Facebook, specific mediums like AR or VR, or massive video game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite. The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using.\n\n## So, what problems does web3 solve?\n\n**Problem:** The data for {X} is under the total control of company {X}. If a user wants to migrate to a new service, they can’t bring their history with them in a way that retains its legitimacy. Company {X} doesn’t want to let them, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at scale in a way so {X} doesn’t maintain total control. See: Twitter API being public with companies built on it, only to be shut down by Twitter.\n\n**Solution:** Build an open immutable protocol and database that is not controlled by a single entity, like [Lens](https://lens.xyz/) and [ENS](http://ens.domains). The database and protocol will become the equivalent of a global utility, accessible and open to anyone for any purpose. Optional: release a governance token as a way to monetize and democratize control of the protocol.\n\n**Problem:** Real-world assets and certificates can’t be put online in a native way that allows them to be instantly validated, transferred, or used in any meaningful way. If I want to get a loan against my home or assets or prove to someone that I’m certified to do {X}, it won’t be as simple as clicking a button on a web form. The friction is too damn high.\n\n**Solution:** The entities that issue assets and certificates can issue NFTs that represent them. By looking at the issuer/history of an NFT and verifying their address or domain name, we can be confident that someone does own a specific asset regardless of what website we are using.\n\n**Problem:** Universal log-in, where you bring specific info with you to new apps and services, requires you to rely on a small number of giant tech companies - and the data you can bring with you is very limited and generally outside your control.\n\n**Solution:** [Private keys](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1389270115884097536)**,** [ENS](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1402388133086367751), and [Sign In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/).\n\n\n---\n\nI think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it.\n\nI think it might make the world more efficient if we were able to instantly verify the authenticity of assets, licenses, and certificates, without the need for every issuer to run massive APIs and authentication services. All one needs to do to ensure the authenticity of an asset is verify the identity and history of the issuer of its NFT.\n\nAnd I think it might make the internet better if we became less reliant on a handful of giant tech companies. Or, at the very least, it might be better if we were given the ability to walk away from them without the need to start again from zero.\n\n## What About the Critics?\n\nI don’t think there’s anything more divisive on the internet right now than web3, besides politics of course. There seems to be an unending number of [intelligent](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch) [people](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF) [who](https://twitter.com/liron) [believe](https://twitter.com/concodanomics) [that web3 is](https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin), [without doubt](https://twitter.com/davidgerard), [a giant scam](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/); that there isn’t a single redeeming quality about it. The bear market hasn’t exactly helped things. One of their main concerns is that web3 has almost certainly produced far more harm than not. You don’t have to [look far](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) to see hoards of people losing their life savings to a web3 Ponzi scheme. And on this specific point, I have to agree. Smart contracts are general purpose. And Ethereum is open and credibly neutral. Anyone can use it however they see fit. And unfortunately, the vast majority of builders are those who want to steal your money. However, it should be obvious that just because a technology has negative externalities doesn’t mean that we should discard the thing altogether. Their argument, if sound, would have to be that web3 only enables scams, and nothing else. As I’ve argued in this piece, I believe that because something like Ethereum is general purpose and credibly neutral, it enables anything to be built on top of it, both good and bad.\n\nThere are a lot of other issues people have with web3. There’s no way I’m going to be able to run through them all, for one because I agree with a lot of them, and also because there are just too many. However, I do want to tackle some of the most common that I see. A large majority of objections you’ll see are specifically for Bitcoin, like PoW mining, which I’m going to ignore, because, for the most part, I agree.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Just use a database. There’s nothing you need to use an NFT or blockchain for that you can’t do with a normal database.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Ethereum is a globally distributed computer that requires a scarce resource to run which it both creates and destroys as it is used. As a consequence of desiring to use the machine for any reason, we naturally find ourselves valuing the resource, which incentivizes others to run it and keep it alive. It’s this incredible property that gives us assurance that it’s going to be around for a long time. It’s a permanent database anyone can use, while no single entity is solely responsible for keeping it running. Anyone can plug into the database, check its’ state, and be confident that it’s accurate. This is fundamentally different than a traditional database and opens up a whole new world of opportunities. If I don’t want my digital objects to exist and persist outside of my involvement, or be capable of moving across the web without continuing to build special purpose integrations, then a normal database is perfect. However, there are cases where the ability to set and forget something, or ensure authenticity is continually preserved is desirable. I want to be able to add something to the chain, leave it there for 50 years, and come back knowing it hasn’t changed. Proof of ownership is an obvious candidate for this functionality.\n\n**OBJECTION:** To parrot [Liron](https://twitter.com/liron): no one will want any of this. You aren’t solving real problems.\n\n**RESPONSE:** In principle, we can use Ethereum to build anything. Granting the assumption that something like Ethereum is capable of sufficiently scaling in the coming years while remaining both trustworthy and general-purpose, we should believe that solving real problems is possible if they exist, and as I’ve argued, I believe they do.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Crypto is just a Ponzi scheme filled with more Ponzi schemes. There’s nothing real there worth paying attention to.\n\n**RESPONSE:** I agree that crypto is filled with Ponzi schemes and other horrible scams and nonsense. And while people may use crypto to solely build Ponzi schemes and nothing else, it seems reasonable to believe that non-Ponzi products are also possible. This is reasonable because just as we can easily point to [Scams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), we can also easily point to non-scams, like the no-loss lottery protocol [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), social protocols like [lens](https://lens.xyz/), the domain name service [ENS](http://ens.domains), and the borrowing and lending platforms [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/). Also, I think there’s an important distinction to be made between Layer one networks like Ethereum and the protocols and apps built on top of them. The Ethereum network is a global computer anyone can use to build protocols on. If everyone used Ethereum to build scams, it still wouldn’t mean that Ethereum itself is a Ponzi or scam, because the door would still be open for someone to build something useful on top of it.\n\n**OBJECTION:** [The Moxie Objection](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). One of the best criticisms I’ve seen has come from the CEO of Signal, Moxie, who makes a clear case for why we might not want to be so optimistic about this. The main claim that I want to focus on here is that web3 isn’t a great improvement from what we’ve seen before, because just like web2 is centralized around a handful of giant companies, like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, web3 isn’t doing any better. While it might look like you can use any wallet you want, and any app can plug directly into protocols on-chain, he says, behind the scenes, there are only one or two companies that everyone is plugging into. Everyone is using Infura and Alchemy to get data from the chain and using Opensea to pull NFT metadata. His takeaway and core criticism is that web3 is building centralizing forces even faster than we saw with web2.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Each centralizing force and entity he points to such as Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea, are not gatekeepers to the data on-chain. The state of the network is open for anyone to access, explore, and use as they please by simply running a node. What Moxie didn’t explain well is that Infura and alchemy simply run Ethereum nodes, which anyone can do, and then provides easy to use interfaces into them for developers. Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea can all be replaced easily and with little barrier to entry. Clients could decide tomorrow that they are no longer aligned with them, and pick new data providers without issue. If you try building with Infura or Alchemy, you’ll see that the interfaces are in fact quite primitive, and while we can expect them to improve, over the coming years we should expect new providers to come onto the scene who offer better services and interfaces into the Ethereum network. We can already see this happening with companies like [Moralis](https://moralis.io). This is not the case with any of the giant web2 companies. Their databases are closed off, and only accessible if you ask them for permission. If you get cut off, there’s no way for you to access the data. They are impossible to compete against let alone replace, because they act as gatekeepers to the data they collect, further locking users into their ecosystem.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of problems still open to be solved. But I have yet to see one that I believe is even likely to be insurmountable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTwitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols. And we know this, because we have real-world examples like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ENS](http://ens.domains), [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), [Lens](https://lens.xyz/), and many others.\n\n\n---\n\nMine is a single answer in a sea of others. There doesn’t seem to be much consensus on what web3 is, let alone what problems it will solve. It doesn’t help that people seem to have gone insane and come under a trance trading hyper-inflated cartoon images. My view is that web3 solves different problems for different people. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum are general-purpose, meaning the protocols and services that can be built on them are near-infinite, and what people will do with them is unpredictable, like trade cartoon JPEGs.\n\nPeople look at web3 and see the hyper-financialization of everything. And this is true; all on-chain assets can instantly be given their own stock market. They see cartoon apes trading for amounts that can only be explained by a world that has collectively lost its mind. And I don’t have good explanations for why that is, or what’s causing masses of people to lose touch with reality. However, if we put aside this [Problem With NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g)s, squint hard and look toward what we have unlocked beyond the insanity and hype, I believe we might see something real and historically important. The large-scale benefits are probably a little further down the road than I’m capable of predicting, but we might see a world that is made more [efficient by the replacement of trust in crumbling institutions and giant tech companies with cryptographic truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuvsLNCg-Y).\n\n*fin*\n\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: as you might have guessed, I’m kind of an Ethereum maximalist.

{"id": "_-3hDIWkEkBx325ZsQYHZ2VVOMEkB1VEVgBgaOcaJVg", "title": "What Problem Does Web3 Solve, Anyway?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zl272m8PrjRBlG02jbAeR.png?height=925&width=1055)\n\nI want to start this post off by stating that I have very little interest in freakishly expensive cartoon animal JPEGs, private Discord servers, or hexagon profile photos. When people think of web3, or look at what the “people in web3” are doing, outside of direct scams this is generally what they see. It looks as though the highest achievement of this third web is that the rich and famous have been given a new way to show everyone how disconnected they are from reality. And they are. I don’t have a lot of explanations for it, and while I too got caught up and enamored with expensive cartoons during the peak of the mania, I have no desire to rationalize any of it away. Instead, for this post, I want to look beyond it.\n\nMy view of web3 is that it offers an important unlock for software developers. It allows them to build and consume general-purpose, open, permanent protocols and APIs that are paid for by their consumers in real-time. These protocols and APIs provide a universal database that can be used by anyone. It allows for permanent, unique objects that can be taken anywhere across the internet without losing sight of their owners, creators, and history. If ape JPEGs are a terrible cartoon use case for this new unlock, what other real-world use cases might be more exciting?\n\nMost real-world web3 protocols and apps right now (that aren’t scams) are financial, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for trading assets, [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for getting yield on assets, and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) for borrowing and lending. At first glance, we might simply see new ways for degenerates to gamble. And we’d be right. If we change lenses, however, and simply look at what has been built we’ll see open protocols that anyone can build a frontend for without the need to ask for API keys. They can be incorporated into anything and remixed by anyone. And, if the promise of holds, they can't be shut down or their data corrupted.\n\nTo build other non-financial services at scale, we’re going to need to batch transactions saving users on insanely high transaction costs. [This is happening](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/), however, for the rest of this post, I want to ignore that. This post won’t talk about scaling solutions or different chains or throw obscure silly technical terms at you. Instead, I just want to answer the questions: “What problem does web3 solve, anyway? What will it look like?”\n\n[Web3, Explained](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1535377548388945920)\n\n> *TL;DR: Web3 offers a general-purpose way to represent ownership of data, assets, and certificates that maintain their authenticity, history, and ownership state across the web.*\n\n## The Limits of Web2\n\nAsset titles, licenses, and certificates can't live on the internet easily in a truly meaningful and native way. If you do put them online, there’s very little one can do to ensure they are authentic or valid, especially if you want them to remain authentic across platforms without building special-purpose APIs and integrations. Allowing their ownership and control to be easily transferred between different people and applications is also not trivial.\n\nIf you graduated from Harvard and you want this achievement displayed on some online profile in a way that can be easily verified, Harvard would need to build and host an API that exposes their alumni list mapped to user accounts in their database, as well as a way for apps to authenticate their users to ensure that they are who they say they are. And Harvard would need to pay a full-time team to maintain these services. And all the apps that want to get this data would need to create a developer account with the Harvard Web Services and get an API key to ensure they don't spam the service. Assuming that anyone would want this for any reason, it’s entirely infeasible and almost certainly not worth the effort.\n\nInstead, we can simplify the entire thing by schools issuing an NFT to students. So long as an app or user knows Harvards wallet address or domain name, they can verify that someone does have a real degree from Harvard, and it will work as well as someone’s ability to currently verify that someone has a “real ape NFT”. The amount of effort this would take is trivial.\n\nExpand this Harvard example, which is incredibly general, to certificates and licenses in general. Companies want to build applications connecting licensed individuals who hold certificates with their clients, while removing manual verifications and minimizing fake accounts. NFTs allow us to do this without requiring issuers to build and maintain specialized APIs and integrations on a case by case basis.\n\nAs far as I can tell, bringing real-world assets and certificates online in a truly native way is incredibly powerful. Currently, if you are issued a certificate that says you are licensed to do {X}, the certificate can only be brought online within the confines of the issuer. You have to log onto their website/app to see any version that other people will trust. If other applications or people want to verify it outside of their site, the issuer has to build an API and service allowing you to authenticate yourself and verify it. the issuer has to host, serve, and control the certificate, and there’s no way for you to take control of it and bring it with you anywhere you want online, without each platform building special-purpose integrations for you. Instead, if a certificate issuer gives you an NFT representing your certificate, you can bring it with you anywhere so long as you can connect your wallet. Your real-estate, hairdressing, law, financial advisor, etc. licenses can all be posted to the top of your Instagram page automatically, allowing anyone to trivially check who issued it and verify its authenticity. All that is required is that you connect your wallet.\n\nBased on many conversions I’ve had, people seem to be easily confused by this concept. “What makes one NFT authentic and others not?”, they ask. “Anyone can create an NFT of anything. I can create an NFT that looks exactly like all of the other real-estate licenses and post it to my Instagram. Who’s to say mine is fake? How would anyone know?” The answer is identity and provenance.\n\nFor something to be considered authentic, we need to know where it came from. In the art world, this concept is known as provenance, and NFTs give us perfect provenance. When I look at the real-estate license NFT on your Instagram account, I’ll be able to click into it and see its token ID, the contract/collection it belongs to, and who issued it. And if it wasn’t issued by NMLS, then I can be near certain that it’s a fake. If I’m feeling extra suspicious, I can open a second application like Etherscan and confirm. I’ll be able to see that you issued it to yourself. The same applies to Nike shoes, art, home titles, etc. If Instagram were so inclined, it could choose to control a list of verified wallets, so that NFTs issued by NMLS and Nike would automatically show a check mark, while others wouldn’t.\n\n## Extending Web2\n\nYelp owns all of the restaurant reviews instead of restaurants and reviewers. If someone wants to compete with Yelp they have to start from scratch. If a restaurant decides they don’t like yelp anymore, they can’t easily take their reviews to a new app or platform without the reviews losing their credibility.\n\nIn contrast, when I build an app or website today I sit on the shoulders of giants. I have a seemingly infinite number of code packages, libraries, snippets, and APIs available to me, and I can use all of these tools to help me build things faster. I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I start a new project. However, if I want to build a competitor to Yelp, again, there is one major area where I have to start from scratch: the data and user base. Even if I scraped Yelp and ported all of their reviews, there’s no reason anyone should assume that the reviews are authentic, because they’ve been disconnected from their creators' accounts.\n\nA web3 version of Yelp, if it lives up to its promise, takes the data and infrastructure and makes it available to anyone while not being under the control of any single entity. Any developer can build a new UI for it. Instead of restaurants and users being tied down to one company, they are free to pick and choose whichever apps they please that connect to open protocols. We would no longer have a single company called Yelp. We would instead have an open and permanent protocol and database, and a potentially infinite number of Yelp competitors connected to it, all sharing the same data. Instead of competing with each other on who can hoard the most data, they would compete on their user experiences and services.\n\nYelp is a pretty inconsequential example. We can apply the same logic to public transportation networks like Uber and Lyft, or services like Airbnb, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, GoodReads, or your Twitter social graph.\n\nAs an Airbnb host, you can’t move platforms easily without losing the credibility of your reviews. you might have spent years building your review score, but now are stuck with a company that continues to increase their take rate, when you want desperately to move to a new platform. If both your listing and it’s reviews were on a neutral protocol similar in kind to something like [@LensProtocol](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol), you could seamlessly move to any competitor also building on the same protocol. In fact, you could exist on all platforms built on the same protocol simultaneously.\n\nOn Twitter, @liron [argues](https://twitter.com/liron/status/1531825233132277760) that the non-existence of a web3 Airbnb is evidence that not only is the project infeasible now but that almost nothing of value can be built here. And he’s right that none of these examples exist yet, but it doesn’t seem to me that we should assume they are impossible in principle. One example we can look at to confirm this is [ENS](http://ens.domains): all of the rules, domains and associated data live on the Ethereum blockchain. Any app can plug directly into the protocol and build their own services around it. People are doing this by building ENS specific [tools](https://ens.tools/domains) and no-fee [marketplaces](https://twitter.com/kodexapp). The Rainbow mobile app is doing this by allowing their users to [register ENS domains](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1536804795075502080) directly in their app. Any app ([and there are many](https://ens.domains/#home-ecosystem)) can pull the ENS data automatically and verify that a wallet owns a specific domain without needing to ask for permission. Granting the assumption that Ethereum is capable of scaling, there’s no difference between the domain names on ENS and the restaurant reviews on a hypothetical web3 version of Yelp, or the listings on a web3 version of Airbnb.\n\n## But what will all of this look like? What should we expect to see?\n\n**Scams. Lots and lots of scams.**\n\nThere’s more to say, of course, but I wanted to get the most obvious prediction out of the way at the outset: we should predict a lot of scams. Beyond that, I’m unfortunately incapable of predicting the future. But I enjoy envisioning it as much as the next science fiction fan. Thankfully, I don’t think it’s going to be too difficult to predict what web3 will look like over the coming years, because, well, a lot of it is already here.\n\nIf you own any NFTs or tokens, you can connect your wallet to any number of different sites and apps and see and manipulate your tokens in different ways. Some applications are special purpose, only surfacing specific types of tokens, while others, like NFT marketplaces, are more general and let you see everything. Depending on where you are, you can perform different actions, or unlock unique features, all dependent on what you hold in your wallet.\n\nI believe this trend will only accelerate, evidenced by [Instagrams recent NFT features](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/instagram-testing-nfts-select-creators/). Applications and companies of all types will issue NFTs and tokens for a multitude of purposes. Some may be valuable generally, but most will probably be highly specific and valuable only to you. This idea that NFTs are inherently investment vehicles couldn’t be more wrong. Over time, we’ll start to think of our wallets the same way Ash Ketchum thought of his Pokédex. You’ll move through the internet, from service to service, collecting unique items you can carry with you that perform different functions. And to state the obvious: everything here is highly speculative. Don’t be surprised if these are wrong. With that said, here’s a non-comprehensive list of things we should reasonably expect to see over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n* When you use an app to work out, if you connect your wallet, [you’ll get badges and awards as NFTs](https://metaverse.joinladder.com/). When you connect your wallet to your Instagram, these awards can automatically display on your profile, or get posted to your story. When you decide to test out another fitness app, you’ll connect your wallet, and be suggested the appropriate workouts based on your fitness level.\n* You’ll go to a concert and get a unique, [limited addition attendance NFT](https://poap.xyz/) from the band, which you can immediately post to your favorite social media app. Later, when the same band releases their next album, they might decide to give everyone holding their live attendance NFTs early access. You’ll go to their site and connect your wallet and prove to them that you went to their concert. The benefit for the artist to do this via an NFT instead of some other more traditional method is they can release the tickets themselves without relying on a third party ticket system like Ticketmaster. They can do this while ensuring that tickets in the future are authentic without managing and controlling the data themselves, or relying on another company doing it for them. \n* Using platforms like [Royal](https://royal.io/), musicians will tokenize their music allowing them to sell equity in their future earnings. They’ll sell a set number of tokens to investors and fans which capture a percentage of earnings from their music. By supporting your favorite artists, you’ll be able to take part in the upside of their success.\n* When you complete an online course and get a certificate, it’ll be issued as an NFT. You’ll connect your wallet to LinkedIn, and add the certificate to display on your profile. Now any time someone sees your profile they’ll see your certificate, and can easily click in to see who issued it and verify its authenticity.\n* When you buy a car or luxury watch, it will come with a proof of purchase and authenticity NFT. If you feel inclined to post a photo to Instagram (as so many do), you’ll post it along with the NFT, to give your content legitimacy. And when you decide to sell, you’ll post it online along with the NFT, to prove to people that they can trust that you do own the car, even if you’ve never sold anything before.\n* Currently, buying digital movies acts as a form of platform lock-in. We can imagine a different world where giant tech companies compete on the services they offer; when you buy a movie from Apple you could be given an NFT granting you the right to watch the movie on any streaming service. Apple would take a cut of the sale of course, but other platforms could compete with them, allowing you to move to different services taking your movies with you. And when the movie studio releases a new title, they can give discounts to everyone who owns one of their other movies. (I don’t believe the platforms are directly incentivized to do this one on their own, so I assume some external pressure would need to exist for this to be realized.)\n* When you play a video game, the items you pick up as you play the game will be issued as NFTs, and proof of their ownership will be capable of being brought with you outside of the game. Third-party apps will let you connect your wallet and verify the authenticity of your items, and allow you to do things with them on their external service, like trading and selling, all while ensuring that the original game creator takes a royalty on the sales. Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.\n* Your favorite charity will issue NFTs in exchange for your donations. Like the award NFTs given by the workout applications, you’ll be able to show off your charity donations on your social media profiles, simultaneously promoting your charity organization while signaling to your audience and friends. Charities will partner with other organizations and companies, offering special perks to their most philanthropic members. I heard this specific example as something that Sam Harris has wanted to do with one of his charities, however, I’m unaware of the status of the project.\n* Your favorite artist or content creator will release limited edition NFTs for their biggest fans. Ownership of one of these NFTs will give you special access to private groups where you get early access to content, and special access with the creator and other super fans. This will feel a lot like being part of a Patreon, with the important difference being that the content creator and their fans are untethered from any one specific platform. Currently, people who use Patreon are bound to it; they are under the total control of the platform. If they decide they no longer like Patreon, leaving isn’t an option, assuming they want to keep the majority of the fan base. NFT-based private groups change this. Anyone can build a platform that validates the NFTs owned by fans and allows them to come together as a private group. Each platform will compete on their UX and additional services they offer, instead of locking in creators and fans like we see today. If the content creator decides to move, everyone will be capable of transitioning seamlessly.\n* The NFTs that content creators sell online can be issued from special smart contracts that guarantee a % of future revenue made by the creator. This idea comes from a [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWTwcySGvrE) given by the head of Instagram, Adam Mosserri. At a basic level, the tokens sold by the content creators can act as equity in the creators' future earnings. As an example, a creator could sell 1,000 tokens, raising $100,000, in exchange for 10% of future earnings for the next 5 years. Platforms like Instagram, Youtube, etc. can read the smart contract and automatically distribute the revenue to the holders. Every time a check rolls in from Youtube, 90% goes to the content creator and 10% goes to the holders of their equity tokens. Every time the content creator signs up to a new platform, they’ll connect their wallet, allowing the new platform to automatically pick up the contract and execute it for any revenue that is made there.\n\nI could keep going. The examples I chose to present here are incredibly limited. But I hope you get the idea: what we can ultimately expect from web3, as I’ve presented, is the ability to generate or receive digital assets and objects which are capable of moving across the web seamlessly while maintaining their authenticity and history, without the need for issuers to stay in the loop or provide services to external parties who require authenticity. If I were to ever invoke the word “metaverse” it would be in regards to this very specific newly unlocked feature of the internet. It’s not about Facebook, specific mediums like AR or VR, or massive video game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite. The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using.\n\n## So, what problems does web3 solve?\n\n**Problem:** The data for {X} is under the total control of company {X}. If a user wants to migrate to a new service, they can’t bring their history with them in a way that retains its legitimacy. Company {X} doesn’t want to let them, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at scale in a way so {X} doesn’t maintain total control. See: Twitter API being public with companies built on it, only to be shut down by Twitter.\n\n**Solution:** Build an open immutable protocol and database that is not controlled by a single entity, like [Lens](https://lens.xyz/) and [ENS](http://ens.domains). The database and protocol will become the equivalent of a global utility, accessible and open to anyone for any purpose. Optional: release a governance token as a way to monetize and democratize control of the protocol.\n\n**Problem:** Real-world assets and certificates can’t be put online in a native way that allows them to be instantly validated, transferred, or used in any meaningful way. If I want to get a loan against my home or assets or prove to someone that I’m certified to do {X}, it won’t be as simple as clicking a button on a web form. The friction is too damn high.\n\n**Solution:** The entities that issue assets and certificates can issue NFTs that represent them. By looking at the issuer/history of an NFT and verifying their address or domain name, we can be confident that someone does own a specific asset regardless of what website we are using.\n\n**Problem:** Universal log-in, where you bring specific info with you to new apps and services, requires you to rely on a small number of giant tech companies - and the data you can bring with you is very limited and generally outside your control.\n\n**Solution:** [Private keys](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1389270115884097536)**,** [ENS](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1402388133086367751), and [Sign In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/).\n\n\n---\n\nI think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it.\n\nI think it might make the world more efficient if we were able to instantly verify the authenticity of assets, licenses, and certificates, without the need for every issuer to run massive APIs and authentication services. All one needs to do to ensure the authenticity of an asset is verify the identity and history of the issuer of its NFT.\n\nAnd I think it might make the internet better if we became less reliant on a handful of giant tech companies. Or, at the very least, it might be better if we were given the ability to walk away from them without the need to start again from zero.\n\n## What About the Critics?\n\nI don’t think there’s anything more divisive on the internet right now than web3, besides politics of course. There seems to be an unending number of [intelligent](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch) [people](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF) [who](https://twitter.com/liron) [believe](https://twitter.com/concodanomics) [that web3 is](https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin), [without doubt](https://twitter.com/davidgerard), [a giant scam](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/); that there isn’t a single redeeming quality about it. The bear market hasn’t exactly helped things. One of their main concerns is that web3 has almost certainly produced far more harm than not. You don’t have to [look far](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) to see hoards of people losing their life savings to a web3 Ponzi scheme. And on this specific point, I have to agree. Smart contracts are general purpose. And Ethereum is open and credibly neutral. Anyone can use it however they see fit. And unfortunately, the vast majority of builders are those who want to steal your money. However, it should be obvious that just because a technology has negative externalities doesn’t mean that we should discard the thing altogether. Their argument, if sound, would have to be that web3 only enables scams, and nothing else. As I’ve argued in this piece, I believe that because something like Ethereum is general purpose and credibly neutral, it enables anything to be built on top of it, both good and bad.\n\nThere are a lot of other issues people have with web3. There’s no way I’m going to be able to run through them all, for one because I agree with a lot of them, and also because there are just too many. However, I do want to tackle some of the most common that I see. A large majority of objections you’ll see are specifically for Bitcoin, like PoW mining, which I’m going to ignore, because, for the most part, I agree.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Just use a database. There’s nothing you need to use an NFT or blockchain for that you can’t do with a normal database.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Ethereum is a globally distributed computer that requires a scarce resource to run which it both creates and destroys as it is used. As a consequence of desiring to use the machine for any reason, we naturally find ourselves valuing the resource, which incentivizes others to run it and keep it alive. It’s this incredible property that gives us assurance that it’s going to be around for a long time. It’s a permanent database anyone can use, while no single entity is solely responsible for keeping it running. Anyone can plug into the database, check its’ state, and be confident that it’s accurate. This is fundamentally different than a traditional database and opens up a whole new world of opportunities. If I don’t want my digital objects to exist and persist outside of my involvement, or be capable of moving across the web without continuing to build special purpose integrations, then a normal database is perfect. However, there are cases where the ability to set and forget something, or ensure authenticity is continually preserved is desirable. I want to be able to add something to the chain, leave it there for 50 years, and come back knowing it hasn’t changed. Proof of ownership is an obvious candidate for this functionality.\n\n**OBJECTION:** To parrot [Liron](https://twitter.com/liron): no one will want any of this. You aren’t solving real problems.\n\n**RESPONSE:** In principle, we can use Ethereum to build anything. Granting the assumption that something like Ethereum is capable of sufficiently scaling in the coming years while remaining both trustworthy and general-purpose, we should believe that solving real problems is possible if they exist, and as I’ve argued, I believe they do.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Crypto is just a Ponzi scheme filled with more Ponzi schemes. There’s nothing real there worth paying attention to.\n\n**RESPONSE:** I agree that crypto is filled with Ponzi schemes and other horrible scams and nonsense. And while people may use crypto to solely build Ponzi schemes and nothing else, it seems reasonable to believe that non-Ponzi products are also possible. This is reasonable because just as we can easily point to [Scams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), we can also easily point to non-scams, like the no-loss lottery protocol [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), social protocols like [lens](https://lens.xyz/), the domain name service [ENS](http://ens.domains), and the borrowing and lending platforms [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/). Also, I think there’s an important distinction to be made between Layer one networks like Ethereum and the protocols and apps built on top of them. The Ethereum network is a global computer anyone can use to build protocols on. If everyone used Ethereum to build scams, it still wouldn’t mean that Ethereum itself is a Ponzi or scam, because the door would still be open for someone to build something useful on top of it.\n\n**OBJECTION:** [The Moxie Objection](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). One of the best criticisms I’ve seen has come from the CEO of Signal, Moxie, who makes a clear case for why we might not want to be so optimistic about this. The main claim that I want to focus on here is that web3 isn’t a great improvement from what we’ve seen before, because just like web2 is centralized around a handful of giant companies, like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, web3 isn’t doing any better. While it might look like you can use any wallet you want, and any app can plug directly into protocols on-chain, he says, behind the scenes, there are only one or two companies that everyone is plugging into. Everyone is using Infura and Alchemy to get data from the chain and using Opensea to pull NFT metadata. His takeaway and core criticism is that web3 is building centralizing forces even faster than we saw with web2.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Each centralizing force and entity he points to such as Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea, are not gatekeepers to the data on-chain. The state of the network is open for anyone to access, explore, and use as they please by simply running a node. What Moxie didn’t explain well is that Infura and alchemy simply run Ethereum nodes, which anyone can do, and then provides easy to use interfaces into them for developers. Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea can all be replaced easily and with little barrier to entry. Clients could decide tomorrow that they are no longer aligned with them, and pick new data providers without issue. If you try building with Infura or Alchemy, you’ll see that the interfaces are in fact quite primitive, and while we can expect them to improve, over the coming years we should expect new providers to come onto the scene who offer better services and interfaces into the Ethereum network. We can already see this happening with companies like [Moralis](https://moralis.io). This is not the case with any of the giant web2 companies. Their databases are closed off, and only accessible if you ask them for permission. If you get cut off, there’s no way for you to access the data. They are impossible to compete against let alone replace, because they act as gatekeepers to the data they collect, further locking users into their ecosystem.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of problems still open to be solved. But I have yet to see one that I believe is even likely to be insurmountable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTwitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols. And we know this, because we have real-world examples like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ENS](http://ens.domains), [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), [Lens](https://lens.xyz/), and many others.\n\n\n---\n\nMine is a single answer in a sea of others. There doesn’t seem to be much consensus on what web3 is, let alone what problems it will solve. It doesn’t help that people seem to have gone insane and come under a trance trading hyper-inflated cartoon images. My view is that web3 solves different problems for different people. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum are general-purpose, meaning the protocols and services that can be built on them are near-infinite, and what people will do with them is unpredictable, like trade cartoon JPEGs.\n\nPeople look at web3 and see the hyper-financialization of everything. And this is true; all on-chain assets can instantly be given their own stock market. They see cartoon apes trading for amounts that can only be explained by a world that has collectively lost its mind. And I don’t have good explanations for why that is, or what’s causing masses of people to lose touch with reality. However, if we put aside this [Problem With NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g)s, squint hard and look toward what we have unlocked beyond the insanity and hype, I believe we might see something real and historically important. The large-scale benefits are probably a little further down the road than I’m capable of predicting, but we might see a world that is made more [efficient by the replacement of trust in crumbling institutions and giant tech companies with cryptographic truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuvsLNCg-Y).\n\n*fin*\n\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: as you might have guessed, I’m kind of an Ethereum maximalist.

Li\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HjdgF1hWFsoEe2newwGoG.png?height=1000&width=1000)\n\n# 二 分享要点\n\n## 圆桌分享\n\n### **（一）投资人视角，看当下链游发展现状**\n\n> **Alex  @0xHongshan 观点分享**\n\n**crypto游戏底层投资逻辑是什么**\n\n游戏投资是一个很短暂的历史，从最早的街机到现在的链游，差不多大概三四十年的时间，游戏投资是没有办法投的。直到17、18年，才出现第一批专业化的市场基金去投游戏。而直到axie的出圈，才出现一批crypto fund或者个人投资者去参与到游戏投资这件事情里面。\n\n但游戏投资属于一个很特殊的投资，是一种内容投资。它并不具备边际效应递减的特征，所以跟一般的VC投资会有所区别。\n\n内容投资。它好的地方在于很难形成垄断，也很容易瓦解先行者的游戏，所以不管是命中率还是收益率，内容投资都比较难。\n\n**那为什么链游值得投资呢**\n\n一个很重要的原因在于他的流动性。有很多叙事和故事可以讲。\n\n区块链对于游戏而言是一个非常大的创新，回看游戏的历史，每一次基础设施的突破与出现，都会很大程度上推动整个行业的发展，像之前的pk类街机、pc普及、光纤普及、手机及移动支付的普及等等，如今区块链的出现和普及，也必然会推动一些非常厉害的游戏出现。\n\n**现阶段链游投资的问题**\n\n但是，回看整个游戏的历史，每个阶段新工具的出现，对于整个行业来说，一定是利好的，但是对于游戏投资而言，它的整体回报率，即使是在移动端出现的阶段，也是比较差的。\n\n目前整个链游的投资，跟一般的内容投资不同点在于，大家更多会关注API，关注怎么去快速回本。很多项目团队的心态也不太正。在我看来，目前整个链游投资，时间相对较短，很多投资框架也不够成熟，项目团队在真正的内容方面，包括它的研发能力和工业能力，可能还没有到我所期待的一个水准。\n\n> **Vincent  @VincentNiu222 观点分享**\n\n传统的游戏投资，本身就是一件非常困难的事情。\n\n链游整个行业投资，其实也是比较困难的。首先，链游行业的发展，速度其实非常快。1718年的时候，大多数游戏都是通过加nft或者加币，但是这些币没有任何的defi玩法。很多团队都没能熬过上一轮熊市，直到大家将defi融入链游，逐渐有了GameFi这一轮的爆发。真正熬到2021年爆发期的链游非常少，即使像Axie，也没有想到会有今天的发展。\n\n这一轮周期爆发之后，链游存在很多的问题。很多链游基本的结果就是在看几个月崩盘。这里面的原因有几方面，一方面是游戏本身的设计，一方面是用户群体在玩这个游戏时的诉求；还有就是大的市场环境所导致的。\n\n游戏机制本身期望通过代币低价获取用户，中后期通过锁币、质押等模型，去减少游戏的抛压、延长游戏的生命周期。将游戏产币的曲线和抛压尽量拉平，让游戏的产出和消耗达到一个平衡。这种时候，如果一旦大的市场环境开始崩，很少能够有项目可以挺住。币价一旦暴跌，就会进入死亡螺旋。\n\n大部分游戏用户，基本上都是以打金为目的进入游戏，几种因素叠加在一起，使得游戏崩盘几乎成为一种必然。这是目前链游普遍存在的现状。\n\n目前对于基金而言，去投GameFi项目，依旧是件很难的事情。目前看来，很少能够有真正穿越周期的项目。哪怕是axie，也不能算是一个很好的投资案例。因为这轮GameFi的爆发，很大程度上是依托在defi的起飞。对于用户层面而言，可能可以用少量资金去参与。但是站在机构的角度，更多可能只是在上升周期赚到钱，在市场不好的情况下，其实很难。\n\n> **Peicai Li  @pcfli 观点分享**\n\n对于目前链游的发展现状，个人有两个词形容。一个是惊喜，一个是失望。\n\n**惊喜在于：**\n\n这一轮区块链和游戏结合，它强大的生命力及很多的可能性。我其实是从13年就关注到了区块链和游戏结合的可能性，但是一直在这轮牛市之前，这个赛道基本上都是处于比较边缘的角色。直到去年defi之后，axie爆发，将链游推到了一个非常繁荣的阶段。\n\n回思这种现象，很大一个原因就是defi和游戏的结合。这里面突出的贡献有两个：dex和流动性挖矿。加上整个市场nft的火热和市场情绪，打开了赛道的新局面。让大家对于区块链的可能性有了更多实现的方式。\n\n**失望在于：**\n\n很多的繁华都是昙花一现。游戏的造富效应没有得到长期保持；整个系统里引入了大多的庞氏结构；游戏本身的可玩性不足。\n\n总的来说，行业还处于非常早期的阶段，一些成熟的机制还没有引入，也没有看到一些高质量的游戏交付，在游戏的信息性上，目前还存在一些问题。\n\n### **（二）对于链游未来的方向探讨**\n\n> **Alex  @0xHongshan观点分享**\n\n**从乐观的角度看：**\n\ncrypto会成为游戏行业的一个标准。区块链对于游戏最大的一个发展，可能会帮助独立游戏对抗原有平台，降低平台在行业内的重要性，实现游戏的自主获客。通过token实现获客。GameFi可能是昙花一现，但是传统游戏拥抱crypto，可能会是一种必然。\n\n\\*\\*悲观的角度：\\*\\*链游投资仍旧不是一个很好的选择，会跟原有的游戏行业投资一样，投资回报率相对较差。\n\n\\*\\*观点小结：\\*\\*web2的游戏会越来越多的拥抱crypto，把它作为一个武器，对抗目前压榨他们价值的大平台。同时，web3的GameFi市场可能会逐渐萎缩，或者形成一个更加闭环的商业模式。总的来说，链游目前处在一个非常不确定的阶段，不管是从产品、商业模式还是融资。\n\n游戏和defi产品还是有本质的区别的。资金盘就是资金盘，游戏就是游戏，这两个也是完全不同的东西，我个人看好用区块链的游戏，但是我不看好用游戏的defi。\n\n> **Vincent  @VincentNiu222观点分享**\n\n游戏的本身还是游戏，它的价值在于消费。本质上大家通过游戏获得了快乐和爽感。在这个过程中，如果说游戏的本质是赚钱，我觉得逻辑上是有问题的。赚钱也不应该是每个人都赚钱，可能只是部分人可以赚到钱。\n\n我个人觉得，下一轮周期，还是Play for fun。Play for fun从游戏诞生到现在，就是一个核心。\n\n在过去很长一段时间的商业模式里，游戏赚的几乎所有的钱，都到了项目开发商手里。过去如果游戏玩家想要赚钱，包括一些游戏主播、竞赛等，更多是依靠游戏周边，而非直接从游戏本身赚钱。\n\n而未来的链游，游戏玩家是可以通过自己的认知赚到游戏里的钱。\n\n现在的链游，跟defi最像的点在于，你有资本就可以赚钱。基本框架都是基于投入本金的回报模型，也就是说你投入的本金越多，你获得收入等比例的提高。与玩家的游戏水平关系不大。策略设计对于赚钱的影响很小，基本上都是因为本金的投入。这种情况肯定是不合理的。如果每个人都是游戏的吸血者，那么这个游戏必然是不可能持续的。\n\n所以最终，游戏还应该是开心的玩游戏，赚钱只是其中的一个附加值。你可以根据你对游戏的认知、对游戏的理解，玩得比别人好，成为头部的10%或者20%，在链游生态里赚钱，而更多的人是为了开心玩游戏。Play for fun & Skill to earn，这是我们觉得比较可能的一种方向。\n\n站在投资的角度，我觉得加密基金投游戏，不是一件容易的事情。\n\n> **Peicai Li  @pcfli观点分享**\n\n我觉得区块链游戏和传统游戏相比，最大的区别在于它的资产性。Web3玩家愿意接受游戏性下降，选择链游，很重要的原因就是玩游戏赚钱这件事情。\n\n一旦游戏里面有了很高的资产价值，那么玩法可能都会变得跟以前不太一样，很多枯燥的玩法，你可能会觉得能够接受甚至有意义。\n\n不管是现在，还是过去的区块链游戏，它很重要的一点，就是它的资产性。只是如何打造长期的资产性，之前一直没有做好。\n\n所以后期链游的发展，一定也是围绕它的资产性。只是说要抛弃一些短期资产的手段，更多重要在于能够打造长期资产。\n\n关于资产升值，我个人的理解，首先资产不可能一直升值。本身也会受到市场波动的影响，但是长期来看，一定是要升值的。这背后很大的一个原因，就是共识的形成。\n\n目前区块链游戏，从资产来看，主要有两种，一种是ERC-20的代币，一种是ERC-721的NFT。\n\n很多游戏并没有利用好nft的共识，一个很重要的点在于，大多数游戏没有利用游戏外赋能。这点做的比较好的是猴子。\n\n我们可以畅想这样一个情景，如果你还没有开始，就先围绕游戏内的nft，营造一种情绪价值，把它打造成游戏的一部分，那么web3的游戏可能会比web2的游戏有着更大的想象空间。\n\n传统游戏一个非常重要的点在于，它会围绕游戏讲一套非常庞大的文化，像暴雪的魔兽；还有像有些游戏，是IP衍生，现有小说电影，再有游戏。像去年很火的哈利波特。\n\n所以web3的游戏，完全也可以先打造游戏外的nft共识资产，在这件事情上，玩家和项目方其实都是有益的。对于早起玩家而言，它可能会带来非常高的收益，像猴子早期0.08个以太，早期mint的收益非常高。而对于项目方而言，现在猴子的交易手续费是非常高的。\n\n所以如果web3的项目方，如果能够先打造游戏外的一个共识资产，开始的时候成本相对角度，后面可以围绕ip打造很多不同类型的游戏，不仅仅是游戏，而是一个完整的文化创作，这可能才是web3游戏的未来形态。\n\n第二点，ERC-20的代币共识的打造，其实也是有共识属性的。但是很多游戏过于看重它的生息性，忽略了共识性。如果能够把代币生息和游戏增发分离开来，通过游戏内的消费减少通货膨胀，可能就会是减少庞氏属性一个非常好的方法。\n\n综合来讲，我相信，区块链在未来的发展中，资产性先行，信息性为资产性服务。对于资产性的打造，要从简单的庞氏+模因，变得不断扩散成为共识，变得更加可持续，达到资产性和信息性的平衡。用资产性吸引玩家，帮助项目方获得开发资金，项目方利用资金开发更多的信息性，吸引更多的人，强化资产性，达到一个正反馈循环。\n\n# （三） **自由讨论**\n\n**问题探讨**\n\n**在我看来，整个区块链游戏应该保持开源和去中心化，在这个过程中，项目方可能会逐渐失去对项目的控制权。如何利用DAO治理，将游戏推到下一个层面？是我想要请教的第一个问题？我们讲web3游戏，回归到用户价值和商业模式本身，web3要如何和web2竞争呢？**\n\n> **Peicai Li  @pcfli**\n\n首先我认同，web3的游戏形态和web2有着很大的不同。但资产性确实是web3游戏的核心概念。比如说流动性挖矿，web2游戏肯定就做不到。\n\nWeb3的游戏生态，可以做很多真实世界你的事情，比如将流动性挖矿类比与传统的基金公司理财，这一点是目前web2游戏都做不到的。\n\n**如何看待游戏的金融新和游戏性，未来的GameFi是play and earn还是play to earn？**\n\n> **Vincent  @VincentNiu222**\n\n我个人觉得未来的GameFi应该是一个play and earn的逻辑。\n\n如果你玩游戏的目标是为了赚钱，那么一定存在（赚钱）效率更高的地方，那如果既想玩游\n\n戏又想赚钱，肯定就是play and earn。\n\nGameFi是game重要还是fi重要，这个问题，其实是要看个人理解的。不同人的理解，偏向可能不同，有的人觉得fi更重要。对于我个人而言，区块链将自称放入游戏中，这件事情本身的重要性我是认同的，但fi本身对于每个人不应该是平等的，未来必然有一批用户，是基于能力to earn而非基于本金去earn。对于游戏中打的好的用户（10-20%+），他们完成的是Proof of work（玩的时间长，熟练度高，游戏理解深等等）。这些用户应该是token经济激励中的核心群体，游戏水平逐步提高获得激励，并能找到旗鼓相当的对手来一场高质量的对弈才是游戏带来最大的乐趣。\n\n**熊市应该如何挑选好项目，能够出圈的优质项目，一般有哪些共同点？**\n\n> **Alex  @0xHongshan**\n\n基于我个人的投资逻辑，我觉得看项目首先是看团队。目前整个区块链项目，团队的能力与义务，在项目发展中起着非常重要的作用。\n\n区块链当前很多项目有一个很明显的问题，在于缺乏监管，上个周期很多项目，到了项目后期，即使有利润去分配，它也未必愿意去做这件事情。所以目前确实会有很多项目，项目方的权利及信息，他和普通人是极度不对等的。所以这个时候，普通人及投资人，其实想要投一个好项目，必然要选择一个靠谱的团队。\n\n另外从游戏本身出发，需要看好游戏本身的叙事能力；同时，游戏的商业能力，包括营销手段等，也是一个重要的考量。\n\n**如何将圈外流量带进web3**\n\n> **Alex  @0xHongshan**\n\n目前已经有一些圈外流量进入到了web3。但是最重要的还是产品，产品的研发能力，怎么做运营、怎么获取用户，这些都是没有捷径可以走的。\n\nweb3作为互联网产品的一部分，首先要在产品上能够更传统web2的产品媲美，同时你用token进行降为打击，获取更多的免费流量，是一个基本。\n\n# 四 **观点分享**\n\n目前整个区块链产业的叙事，在我看来是不成立的。我们开始讲什么是web3游戏，开始的时候认为游戏生态应该是一个协议，所有游戏内的收益应该要分配给游戏生态的参与者。但是目前通过代币激励的这种机制是否有待改善，我觉得是值得商榷的。\n\n——NeoSu\n\n我作为一个游戏的早起从业者，在我看来，元宇宙和web3，很多都是一个循环。最早在1997年unit online这款网络游戏中，就有这样的概念：我们创造一个游戏的框架，大家加入到游戏的开发过程中。通过第三方软件，进行虚拟游戏的设置，进行开发更多的玩法。\n\n最初我们对于游戏开发的设想，大家就是在尝试建立一个虚拟世界：游戏只建立一个基本框架，通过人与人的互动，通过需求形成阶段、形成经济环境、形成一般等价物。后来随着资本的进入，资本鼓励游戏氪金，缩减游戏市场资产的交易，获得更多的游戏控制权。其实是有这样的一个过程。\n\n但是web2的游戏，像网易的藏宝库系列，其实已经在发掘游戏内的经济价值，玩家通过时间赚取的道具，是可以有途径换成法币，或者投入到下一个阶段的生产的。这是我们所谓的传统游戏也在探索的点。\n\n对于我们团队而言，区块链游戏让我们觉得欣慰的点，是它让大家有机会回到游戏最初开始的那个阶段。大家有机会通过区块链，通过区块链和nft技术，实现一个虚拟世界，实现对于游戏内资产的产生和控制调节。从而获得客户认可的价值的虚拟资产。\n\n同时在整个运营过程中，我们发现，目前很多游戏用户，核心诉求是投机性价值的增长。\n\n我相信对于长期来看，game和gamefi的界限可能会逐渐模糊，但是从一个项目方的角度来看，目前这个阶段，对于游戏开发商而言，是遵循自己的理解，还是顺应用户需求，是需要考量的。\n\n——王鸿博（毛刷）\n\n目前相对不gamefi，其实我想提另外一个概念，叫做Financial Game。很多大厂大制作的游戏，他们有自己的获客渠道和盈利模式，其实是没有动力去拥抱web3的。真正有动力去拥抱web3的，更多是一些小的独立游戏团队，他们愿意通过发token，让渡未来的收益，获取当下的流量，获取真正的游戏用户。\n\n目前链游市场，很多用户，都不是真正的游戏用户，他们更多是冲着赚钱来的，这种用户，带来的结果，必然是庞氏模型，导致崩盘。\n\n游戏获客的难点，一个重要原因，是因为支付通道没有打通。这就导致用户教育成本非常的高。\n\nGame Finance这块，让我们这些早期关注者特别心动的理由，是我们看到了一个去中心化的金融体系，但是这个体系，还有这自己的缺陷，在于缺少应用和监控。\n\n所有目前很多链游，可能会是两个不同的方向：金融游戏化和游戏化金融。\n\n——胡烜峰-GameFarmer\n\n# 五 相关链接\n\n###

{"id": "G_d9n6KdrxJKaqwdh10-jUxJmWYyLPxV1CH1WAgouE4", "title": "What Problem Does Web3 Solve, Anyway?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zl272m8PrjRBlG02jbAeR.png?height=925&width=1055)\n\nI want to start this post off by stating that I have very little interest in freakishly expensive cartoon animal JPEGs, private Discord servers, or hexagon profile photos. When people think of web3, or look at what the “people in web3” are doing, outside of direct scams this is generally what they see. It looks as though the highest achievement of this third web is that the rich and famous have been given a new way to show everyone how disconnected they are from reality. And they are. I don’t have a lot of explanations for it, and while I too got caught up and enamored with expensive cartoons during the peak of the mania, I have no desire to rationalize any of it away. Instead, for this post, I want to look beyond it.\n\nMy view of web3 is that it offers an important unlock for software developers. It allows them to build and consume general-purpose, open, permanent protocols and APIs that are paid for by their consumers in real-time. These protocols and APIs provide a universal database that can be used by anyone. It allows for permanent, unique objects that can be taken anywhere across the internet without losing sight of their owners, creators, and history. If ape JPEGs are a terrible cartoon use case for this new unlock, what other real-world use cases might be more exciting?\n\nMost real-world web3 protocols and apps right now (that aren’t scams) are financial, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for trading assets, [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for getting yield on assets, and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) for borrowing and lending. At first glance, we might simply see new ways for degenerates to gamble. And we’d be right. If we change lenses, however, and simply look at what has been built we’ll see open protocols that anyone can build a frontend for without the need to ask for API keys. They can be incorporated into anything and remixed by anyone. And, if the promise of holds, they can't be shut down or their data corrupted.\n\nTo build other non-financial services at scale, we’re going to need to batch transactions saving users on insanely high transaction costs. [This is happening](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/), however, for the rest of this post, I want to ignore that. This post won’t talk about scaling solutions or different chains or throw obscure silly technical terms at you. Instead, I just want to answer the questions: “What problem does web3 solve, anyway? What will it look like?”\n\n[Web3, Explained](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1535377548388945920)\n\n> *TL;DR: Web3 offers a general-purpose way to represent ownership of data, assets, and certificates that maintain their authenticity, history, and ownership state across the web.*\n\n## The Limits of Web2\n\nAsset titles, licenses, and certificates can't live on the internet easily in a truly meaningful and native way. If you do put them online, there’s very little one can do to ensure they are authentic or valid, especially if you want them to remain authentic across platforms without building special-purpose APIs and integrations. Allowing their ownership and control to be easily transferred between different people and applications is also not trivial.\n\nIf you graduated from Harvard and you want this achievement displayed on some online profile in a way that can be easily verified, Harvard would need to build and host an API that exposes their alumni list mapped to user accounts in their database, as well as a way for apps to authenticate their users to ensure that they are who they say they are. And Harvard would need to pay a full-time team to maintain these services. And all the apps that want to get this data would need to create a developer account with the Harvard Web Services and get an API key to ensure they don't spam the service. Assuming that anyone would want this for any reason, it’s entirely infeasible and almost certainly not worth the effort.\n\nInstead, we can simplify the entire thing by schools issuing an NFT to students. So long as an app or user knows Harvards wallet address or domain name, they can verify that someone does have a real degree from Harvard, and it will work as well as someone’s ability to currently verify that someone has a “real ape NFT”. The amount of effort this would take is trivial.\n\nExpand this Harvard example, which is incredibly general, to certificates and licenses in general. Companies want to build applications connecting licensed individuals who hold certificates with their clients, while removing manual verifications and minimizing fake accounts. NFTs allow us to do this without requiring issuers to build and maintain specialized APIs and integrations on a case by case basis.\n\nAs far as I can tell, bringing real-world assets and certificates online in a truly native way is incredibly powerful. Currently, if you are issued a certificate that says you are licensed to do {X}, the certificate can only be brought online within the confines of the issuer. You have to log onto their website/app to see any version that other people will trust. If other applications or people want to verify it outside of their site, the issuer has to build an API and service allowing you to authenticate yourself and verify it, or worse, email the issuer manually. The issuer has to host, serve, and control the certificate, and there’s no way for you to take control of it and bring it with you anywhere you want online, without each platform building special-purpose integrations for you. Instead, if a certificate issuer gives you an NFT representing your certificate, you can bring it with you anywhere so long as you can connect your wallet. Your real-estate, hairdressing, law, financial advisor, etc. licenses can all be posted to the top of your Instagram page automatically, allowing anyone to trivially check who issued it and verify its authenticity. All that is required is that you connect your wallet.\n\nBased on many conversions I’ve had, people seem to be easily confused by this concept. “What makes one NFT authentic and others not?”, they ask. “Anyone can create an NFT of anything. I can create an NFT that looks exactly like all of the other real-estate licenses and post it to my Instagram. Who’s to say mine is fake? How would anyone know?” The answer is identity and provenance.\n\nFor something to be considered authentic, we need to know where it came from. In the art world, this concept is known as provenance, and NFTs give us perfect provenance. When I look at the real-estate license NFT on your Instagram account, I’ll be able to click into it and see its token ID, the contract/collection it belongs to, and who issued it. And if it wasn’t issued by NMLS, then I can be near certain that it’s a fake. If I’m feeling extra suspicious, I can open a second application like Etherscan and confirm. I’ll be able to see that you issued it to yourself. The same applies to Nike shoes, art, home titles, etc. If Instagram were so inclined, it could choose to control a list of verified wallets, so that NFTs issued by NMLS and Nike would automatically show a check mark, while others wouldn’t.\n\n## Extending Web2\n\nYelp owns all of the restaurant reviews instead of restaurants and reviewers. If someone wants to compete with Yelp they have to start from scratch. If a restaurant decides they don’t like yelp anymore, they can’t easily take their reviews to a new app or platform without the reviews losing their credibility.\n\nIn contrast, when I build an app or website today I sit on the shoulders of giants. I have a seemingly infinite number of code packages, libraries, snippets, and APIs available to me, and I can use all of these tools to help me build things faster. I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I start a new project. However, if I want to build a competitor to Yelp, again, there is one major area where I have to start from scratch: the data and user base. Even if I scraped Yelp and ported all of their reviews, there’s no reason anyone should assume that the reviews are authentic, because they’ve been disconnected from their creators' accounts.\n\nA web3 version of Yelp, if it lives up to its promise, takes the data and infrastructure and makes it available to anyone while not being under the control of any single entity. Any developer can build a new UI for it. Instead of restaurants and users being tied down to one company, they are free to pick and choose whichever apps they please that connect to open protocols. We would no longer have a single company called Yelp. We would instead have an open and permanent protocol and database, and a potentially infinite number of Yelp competitors connected to it, all sharing the same data. Instead of competing with each other on who can hoard the most data, they would compete on their user experiences and services.\n\nYelp is a pretty inconsequential example. We can apply the same logic to public transportation networks like Uber and Lyft, or services like Airbnb, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, GoodReads, or your Twitter social graph.\n\nAs an Airbnb host, you can’t move platforms easily without losing the credibility of your reviews. you might have spent years building your review score, but now are stuck with a company that continues to increase their take rate, when you want desperately to move to a new platform. If both your listing and it’s reviews were on a neutral protocol similar in kind to something like [@LensProtocol](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol), you could seamlessly move to any competitor also building on the same protocol. In fact, you could exist on all platforms built on the same protocol simultaneously.\n\nOn Twitter, @liron [argues](https://twitter.com/liron/status/1531825233132277760) that the non-existence of a web3 Airbnb is evidence that not only is the project infeasible now but that almost nothing of value can be built here. And he’s right that none of these examples exist yet, but it doesn’t seem to me that we should assume they are impossible in principle. One example we can look at to confirm this is [ENS](http://ens.domains): all of the rules, domains and associated data live on the Ethereum blockchain. Any app can plug directly into the protocol and build their own services around it. People are doing this by building ENS specific [tools](https://ens.tools/domains) and no-fee [marketplaces](https://twitter.com/kodexapp). The Rainbow mobile app is doing this by allowing their users to [register ENS domains](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1536804795075502080) directly in their app. Any app ([and there are many](https://ens.domains/#home-ecosystem)) can pull the ENS data automatically and verify that a wallet owns a specific domain without needing to ask for permission. Granting the assumption that Ethereum is capable of scaling, there’s no difference between the domain names on ENS and the restaurant reviews on a hypothetical web3 version of Yelp, or the listings on a web3 version of Airbnb.\n\n## But what will all of this look like? What should we expect to see?\n\n**Scams. Lots and lots of scams.**\n\nThere’s more to say, of course, but I wanted to get the most obvious prediction out of the way at the outset: we should predict a lot of scams. Beyond that, I’m unfortunately incapable of predicting the future. But I enjoy envisioning it as much as the next science fiction fan. Thankfully, I don’t think it’s going to be too difficult to predict what web3 will look like over the coming years, because, well, a lot of it is already here.\n\nIf you own any NFTs or tokens, you can connect your wallet to any number of different sites and apps and see and manipulate your tokens in different ways. Some applications are special purpose, only surfacing specific types of tokens, while others, like NFT marketplaces, are more general and let you see everything. Depending on where you are, you can perform different actions, or unlock unique features, all dependent on what you hold in your wallet.\n\nI believe this trend will only accelerate, evidenced by [Instagrams recent NFT features](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/instagram-testing-nfts-select-creators/). Applications and companies of all types will issue NFTs and tokens for a multitude of purposes. Some may be valuable generally, but most will probably be highly specific and valuable only to you. This idea that NFTs are inherently investment vehicles couldn’t be more wrong. Over time, we’ll start to think of our wallets the same way Ash Ketchum thought of his Pokédex. You’ll move through the internet, from service to service, collecting unique items you can carry with you that perform different functions. And to state the obvious: everything here is highly speculative. Don’t be surprised if these are wrong. With that said, here’s a non-comprehensive list of things we should reasonably expect to see over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n* When you use an app to work out, if you connect your wallet, [you’ll get badges and awards as NFTs](https://metaverse.joinladder.com/). When you connect your wallet to your Instagram, these awards can automatically display on your profile, or get posted to your story. When you decide to test out another fitness app, you’ll connect your wallet, and be suggested the appropriate workouts based on your fitness level.\n* You’ll go to a concert and get a unique, [limited addition attendance NFT](https://poap.xyz/) from the band, which you can immediately post to your favorite social media app. Later, when the same band releases their next album, they might decide to give everyone holding their live attendance NFTs early access. You’ll go to their site and connect your wallet and prove to them that you went to their concert. The benefit for the artist to do this via an NFT instead of some other more traditional method is they can release the tickets themselves without relying on a third party ticket system like Ticketmaster. They can do this while ensuring that tickets in the future are authentic without managing and controlling the data themselves, or relying on another company doing it for them. \n* Using platforms like [Royal](https://royal.io/), musicians will tokenize their music allowing them to sell equity in their future earnings. They’ll sell a set number of tokens to investors and fans which capture a percentage of earnings from their music. By supporting your favorite artists, you’ll be able to take part in the upside of their success.\n* When you complete an online course and get a certificate, it’ll be issued as an NFT. You’ll connect your wallet to LinkedIn, and add the certificate to display on your profile. Now any time someone sees your profile they’ll see your certificate, and can easily click in to see who issued it and verify its authenticity.\n* When you buy a car or luxury watch, it will come with a proof of purchase and authenticity NFT. If you feel inclined to post a photo to Instagram (as so many do), you’ll post it along with the NFT, to give your content legitimacy. And when you decide to sell, you’ll post it online along with the NFT, to prove to people that they can trust that you do own the car, even if you’ve never sold anything before.\n* Currently, buying digital movies acts as a form of platform lock-in. We can imagine a different world where giant tech companies compete on the services they offer; when you buy a movie from Apple you could be given an NFT granting you the right to watch the movie on any streaming service. Apple would take a cut of the sale of course, but other platforms could compete with them, allowing you to move to different services taking your movies with you. And when the movie studio releases a new title, they can give discounts to everyone who owns one of their other movies. (I don’t believe the platforms are directly incentivized to do this one on their own, so I assume some external pressure would need to exist for this to be realized.)\n* When you play a video game, the items you pick up as you play the game will be issued as NFTs, and proof of their ownership will be capable of being brought with you outside of the game. Third-party apps will let you connect your wallet and verify the authenticity of your items, and allow you to do things with them on their external service, like trading and selling, all while ensuring that the original game creator takes a royalty on the sales. Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.\n* Your favorite charity will issue NFTs in exchange for your donations. Like the award NFTs given by the workout applications, you’ll be able to show off your charity donations on your social media profiles, simultaneously promoting your charity organization while signaling to your audience and friends. Charities will partner with other organizations and companies, offering special perks to their most philanthropic members. I heard this specific example as something that Sam Harris has wanted to do with one of his charities, however, I’m unaware of the status of the project.\n* Your favorite artist or content creator will release limited edition NFTs for their biggest fans. Ownership of one of these NFTs will give you special access to private groups where you get early access to content, and special access with the creator and other super fans. This will feel a lot like being part of a Patreon, with the important difference being that the content creator and their fans are untethered from any one specific platform. Currently, people who use Patreon are bound to it; they are under the total control of the platform. If they decide they no longer like Patreon, leaving isn’t an option, assuming they want to keep the majority of the fan base. NFT-based private groups change this. Anyone can build a platform that validates the NFTs owned by fans and allows them to come together as a private group. Each platform will compete on their UX and additional services they offer, instead of locking in creators and fans like we see today. If the content creator decides to move, everyone will be capable of transitioning seamlessly.\n* The NFTs that content creators sell online can be issued from special smart contracts that guarantee a % of future revenue made by the creator. This idea comes from a [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWTwcySGvrE) given by the head of Instagram, Adam Mosserri. At a basic level, the tokens sold by the content creators can act as equity in the creators' future earnings. As an example, a creator could sell 1,000 tokens, raising $100,000, in exchange for 10% of future earnings for the next 5 years. Platforms like Instagram, Youtube, etc. can read the smart contract and automatically distribute the revenue to the holders. Every time a check rolls in from Youtube, 90% goes to the content creator and 10% goes to the holders of their equity tokens. Every time the content creator signs up to a new platform, they’ll connect their wallet, allowing the new platform to automatically pick up the contract and execute it for any revenue that is made there.\n\nI could keep going. The examples I chose to present here are incredibly limited. But I hope you get the idea: what we can ultimately expect from web3, as I’ve presented, is the ability to generate or receive digital assets and objects which are capable of moving across the web seamlessly while maintaining their authenticity and history, without the need for issuers to stay in the loop or provide services to external parties who require authenticity. If I were to ever invoke the word “metaverse” it would be in regards to this very specific newly unlocked feature of the internet. It’s not about Facebook, specific mediums like AR or VR, or massive video game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite. The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using.\n\n## So, what problems does web3 solve?\n\n**Problem:** The data for {X} is under the total control of company {X}. If a user wants to migrate to a new service, they can’t bring their history with them in a way that retains its legitimacy. Company {X} doesn’t want to let them, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at scale in a way so {X} doesn’t maintain total control. See: Twitter API being public with companies built on it, only to be shut down by Twitter.\n\n**Solution:** Build an open immutable protocol and database that is not controlled by a single entity, like [Lens](https://lens.xyz/) and [ENS](http://ens.domains). The database and protocol will become the equivalent of a global utility, accessible and open to anyone for any purpose. Optional: release a governance token as a way to monetize and democratize control of the protocol.\n\n**Problem:** Real-world assets and certificates can’t be put online in a native way that allows them to be instantly validated, transferred, or used in any meaningful way. If I want to get a loan against my home or assets or prove to someone that I’m certified to do {X}, it won’t be as simple as clicking a button on a web form. The friction is too damn high.\n\n**Solution:** The entities that issue assets and certificates can issue NFTs that represent them. By looking at the issuer/history of an NFT and verifying their address or domain name, we can be confident that someone does own a specific asset regardless of what website we are using.\n\n**Problem:** Universal log-in, where you bring specific info with you to new apps and services, requires you to rely on a small number of giant tech companies - and the data you can bring with you is very limited and generally outside your control.\n\n**Solution:** [Private keys](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1389270115884097536)**,** [ENS](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1402388133086367751), and [Sign In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/).\n\n\n---\n\nI think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it.\n\nI think it might make the world more efficient if we were able to instantly verify the authenticity of assets, licenses, and certificates, without the need for every issuer to run massive APIs and authentication services. All one needs to do to ensure the authenticity of an asset is verify the identity and history of the issuer of its NFT.\n\nAnd I think it might make the internet better if we became less reliant on a handful of giant tech companies. Or, at the very least, it might be better if we were given the ability to walk away from them without the need to start again from zero.\n\n## What About the Critics?\n\nI don’t think there’s anything more divisive on the internet right now than web3, besides politics of course. There seems to be an unending number of [intelligent](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch) [people](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF) [who](https://twitter.com/liron) [believe](https://twitter.com/concodanomics) [that web3 is](https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin), [without doubt](https://twitter.com/davidgerard), [a giant scam](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/); that there isn’t a single redeeming quality about it. The bear market hasn’t exactly helped things. One of their main concerns is that web3 has almost certainly produced far more harm than not. You don’t have to [look far](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) to see hoards of people losing their life savings to a web3 Ponzi scheme. And on this specific point, I have to agree. Smart contracts are general purpose. And Ethereum is open and credibly neutral. Anyone can use it however they see fit. And unfortunately, the vast majority of builders are those who want to steal your money. However, it should be obvious that just because a technology has negative externalities doesn’t mean that we should discard the thing altogether. Their argument, if sound, would have to be that web3 only enables scams, and nothing else. As I’ve argued in this piece, I believe that because something like Ethereum is general purpose and credibly neutral, it enables anything to be built on top of it, both good and bad.\n\nThere are a lot of other issues people have with web3. There’s no way I’m going to be able to run through them all, for one because I agree with a lot of them, and also because there are just too many. However, I do want to tackle some of the most common that I see. A large majority of objections you’ll see are specifically for Bitcoin, like PoW mining, which I’m going to ignore, because, for the most part, I agree.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Just use a database. There’s nothing you need to use an NFT or blockchain for that you can’t do with a normal database.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Ethereum is a globally distributed computer that requires a scarce resource to run which it both creates and destroys as it is used. As a consequence of desiring to use the machine for any reason, we naturally find ourselves valuing the resource, which incentivizes others to run it and keep it alive. It’s this incredible property that gives us assurance that it’s going to be around for a long time. It’s a permanent database anyone can use, while no single entity is solely responsible for keeping it running. Anyone can plug into the database, check its’ state, and be confident that it’s accurate. This is fundamentally different than a traditional database and opens up a whole new world of opportunities. If I don’t want my digital objects to exist and persist outside of my involvement, or be capable of moving across the web without continuing to build special purpose integrations, then a normal database is perfect. However, there are cases where the ability to set and forget something, or ensure authenticity is continually preserved is desirable. I want to be able to add something to the chain, leave it there for 50 years, and come back knowing it hasn’t changed. Proof of ownership is an obvious candidate for this functionality.\n\n**OBJECTION:** To parrot [Liron](https://twitter.com/liron): no one will want any of this. You aren’t solving real problems.\n\n**RESPONSE:** In principle, we can use Ethereum to build anything. Granting the assumption that something like Ethereum is capable of sufficiently scaling in the coming years while remaining both trustworthy and general-purpose, we should believe that solving real problems is possible if they exist, and as I’ve argued, I believe they do.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Crypto is just a Ponzi scheme filled with more Ponzi schemes. There’s nothing real there worth paying attention to.\n\n**RESPONSE:** I agree that crypto is filled with Ponzi schemes and other horrible scams and nonsense. And while people may use crypto to solely build Ponzi schemes and nothing else, it seems reasonable to believe that non-Ponzi products are also possible. This is reasonable because just as we can easily point to [Scams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), we can also easily point to non-scams, like the no-loss lottery protocol [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), social protocols like [lens](https://lens.xyz/), the domain name service [ENS](http://ens.domains), and the borrowing and lending platforms [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/). Also, I think there’s an important distinction to be made between Layer one networks like Ethereum and the protocols and apps built on top of them. The Ethereum network is a global computer anyone can use to build protocols on. If everyone used Ethereum to build scams, it still wouldn’t mean that Ethereum itself is a Ponzi or scam, because the door would still be open for someone to build something useful on top of it.\n\n**OBJECTION:** [The Moxie Objection](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). One of the best criticisms I’ve seen has come from the CEO of Signal, Moxie, who makes a clear case for why we might not want to be so optimistic about this. The main claim that I want to focus on here is that web3 isn’t a great improvement from what we’ve seen before, because just like web2 is centralized around a handful of giant companies, like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, web3 isn’t doing any better. While it might look like you can use any wallet you want, and any app can plug directly into protocols on-chain, he says, behind the scenes, there are only one or two companies that everyone is plugging into. Everyone is using Infura and Alchemy to get data from the chain and using Opensea to pull NFT metadata. His takeaway and core criticism is that web3 is building centralizing forces even faster than we saw with web2.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Each centralizing force and entity he points to such as Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea, are not gatekeepers to the data on-chain. The state of the network is open for anyone to access, explore, and use as they please by simply running a node. What Moxie didn’t explain well is that Infura and alchemy simply run Ethereum nodes, which anyone can do, and then provides easy to use interfaces into them for developers. Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea can all be replaced easily and with little barrier to entry. Clients could decide tomorrow that they are no longer aligned with them, and pick new data providers without issue. If you try building with Infura or Alchemy, you’ll see that the interfaces are in fact quite primitive, and while we can expect them to improve, over the coming years we should expect new providers to come onto the scene who offer better services and interfaces into the Ethereum network. We can already see this happening with companies like [Moralis](https://moralis.io). This is not the case with any of the giant web2 companies. Their databases are closed off, and only accessible if you ask them for permission. If you get cut off, there’s no way for you to access the data. They are impossible to compete against let alone replace, because they act as gatekeepers to the data they collect, further locking users into their ecosystem.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of problems still open to be solved. But I have yet to see one that I believe is even likely to be insurmountable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTwitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols. And we know this, because we have real-world examples like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ENS](http://ens.domains), [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), [Lens](https://lens.xyz/), and many others.\n\n\n---\n\nMine is a single answer in a sea of others. There doesn’t seem to be much consensus on what web3 is, let alone what problems it will solve. It doesn’t help that people seem to have gone insane and come under a trance trading hyper-inflated cartoon images. My view is that web3 solves different problems for different people. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum are general-purpose, meaning the protocols and services that can be built on them are near-infinite, and what people will do with them is unpredictable, like trade cartoon JPEGs.\n\nPeople look at web3 and see the hyper-financialization of everything. And this is true; all on-chain assets can instantly be given their own stock market. They see cartoon apes trading for amounts that can only be explained by a world that has collectively lost its mind. And I don’t have good explanations for why that is, or what’s causing masses of people to lose touch with reality. However, if we put aside this [Problem With NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g)s, squint hard and look toward what we have unlocked beyond the insanity and hype, I believe we might see something real and historically important. The large-scale benefits are probably a little further down the road than I’m capable of predicting, but we might see a world that is made more [efficient by the replacement of trust in crumbling institutions and giant tech companies with cryptographic truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuvsLNCg-Y).\n\n*fin*\n\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: as you might have guessed, I’m kind of an Ethereum maximalist. I’ll probably write about why in another post.*\n\n\n---\n\nFAQ\n\n* Q: Aren’t you using web3 as a synonym for NFTs? \n A: When I was using the term \"web3\", I was referring to this new ability to build protocols and shared databases. An NFT is just a specific type of object in those databases that conforms to a standard. Conforming to that standard when building these protocols is optional, depending on what you want to do. Following the NFT standard simply ensures your items are compatible with other protocols. There are even different types of NFTs standards you can create, and you aren't limited to only creating NFTs.

{"id": "NWgJA82CdrbmMzVgJrZrTqhlx5lPfr9s-NXRipiYpyA", "title": "What Problem Does Web3 Solve, Anyway?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zl272m8PrjRBlG02jbAeR.png?height=925&width=1055)\n\nI want to start this post off by stating that I have very little interest in freakishly expensive cartoon animal JPEGs, private Discord servers, or hexagon profile photos. When people think of web3, or look at what the “people in web3” are doing, outside of direct scams this is generally what they see. It looks as though the highest achievement of this third web is that the rich and famous have been given a new way to show everyone how disconnected they are from reality. And they are. I don’t have a lot of explanations for it, and while I too got caught up and enamored with expensive cartoons during the peak of the mania, I have no desire to rationalize any of it away. Instead, for this post, I want to look beyond it.\n\nMy view of web3 is that it offers an important unlock for software developers. It allows them to build and consume general-purpose, open, permanent protocols and APIs that are paid for by their consumers in real-time. These protocols and APIs provide a universal database that can be used by anyone. It allows for permanent, unique objects that can be taken anywhere across the internet without losing sight of their owners, creators, and history. If ape JPEGs are a terrible cartoon use case for this new unlock, what other real-world use cases might be more exciting?\n\nMost real-world web3 protocols and apps right now (that aren’t scams) are financial, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for trading assets, [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for getting yield on assets, and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) for borrowing and lending. At first glance, we might simply see new ways for degenerates to gamble. And we’d be right. If we change lenses, however, and simply look at what has been built we’ll see open protocols that anyone can build a frontend for without the need to ask for API keys. They can be incorporated into anything and remixed by anyone. And, if the promise of holds, they can't be shut down or their data corrupted.\n\nTo build other non-financial services at scale, we’re going to need to batch transactions saving users on insanely high transaction costs. [This is happening](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/), however, for the rest of this post, I want to ignore that. This post won’t talk about scaling solutions or different chains or throw obscure silly technical terms at you. Instead, I just want to answer the questions: “What problem does web3 solve, anyway? What will it look like?”\n\n[Web3, Explained](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1535377548388945920)\n\n> *TL;DR: Web3 offers a general-purpose way to represent ownership of data, assets, and certificates that maintain their authenticity, history, and ownership state across the web.*\n\n## The Limits of Web2\n\nAsset titles, licenses, and certificates can't live on the internet easily in a truly meaningful and native way. If you do put them online, there’s very little one can do to ensure they are authentic or valid, especially if you want them to remain authentic across platforms without building special-purpose APIs and integrations. Allowing their ownership and control to be easily transferred between different people and applications is also not trivial.\n\nIf you graduated from Harvard and you want this achievement displayed on some online profile in a way that can be easily verified, Harvard would need to build and host an API that exposes their alumni list mapped to user accounts in their database, as well as a way for apps to authenticate their users to ensure that they are who they say they are. And Harvard would need to pay a full-time team to maintain these services. And all the apps that want to get this data would need to create a developer account with the Harvard Web Services and get an API key to ensure they don't spam the service. Assuming that anyone would want this for any reason, it’s entirely infeasible and almost certainly not worth the effort.\n\nInstead, we can simplify the entire thing by schools issuing an NFT to students. So long as an app or user knows Harvards wallet address or domain name, they can verify that someone does have a real degree from Harvard, and it will work as well as someone’s ability to currently verify that someone has a “real ape NFT”. The amount of effort this would take is trivial.\n\nExpand this Harvard example, which is incredibly general, to certificates and licenses in general. Companies want to build applications connecting licensed individuals who hold certificates with their clients, while removing manual verifications and minimizing fake accounts. NFTs allow us to do this without requiring issuers to build and maintain specialized APIs and integrations on a case by case basis.\n\nAs far as I can tell, bringing real-world assets and certificates online in a truly native way is incredibly powerful. Currently, if you are issued a certificate that says you are licensed to do {X}, the certificate can only be brought online within the confines of the issuer. You have to log onto their website/app to see any version that other people will trust. If other applications or people want to verify it outside of their site, the issuer has to build an API and service allowing you to authenticate yourself and verify it, or worse, email the issuer manually. The issuer has to host, serve, and control the certificate, and there’s no way for you to take control of it and bring it with you anywhere you want online, without each platform building special-purpose integrations for you. Instead, if a certificate issuer gives you an NFT representing your certificate, you can bring it with you anywhere so long as you can connect your wallet. Your real-estate, hairdressing, law, financial advisor, etc. licenses can all be posted to the top of your Instagram page automatically, allowing anyone to trivially check who issued it and verify its authenticity. All that is required is that you connect your wallet.\n\nBased on many conversions I’ve had, people seem to be easily confused by this concept. “What makes one NFT authentic and others not?”, they ask. “Anyone can create an NFT of anything. I can create an NFT that looks exactly like all of the other real-estate licenses and post it to my Instagram. Who’s to say mine is fake? How would anyone know?” The answer is identity and provenance.\n\nFor something to be considered authentic, we need to know where it came from. In the art world, this concept is known as provenance, and NFTs give us perfect provenance. When I look at the real-estate license NFT on your Instagram account, I’ll be able to click into it and see its token ID, the contract/collection it belongs to, and who issued it. And if it wasn’t issued by NMLS, then I can be near certain that it’s a fake. If I’m feeling extra suspicious, I can open a second application like Etherscan and confirm. I’ll be able to see that you issued it to yourself. The same applies to Nike shoes, art, home titles, etc. If Instagram were so inclined, it could choose to control a list of verified wallets, so that NFTs issued by NMLS and Nike would automatically show a check mark, while others wouldn’t.\n\n## Extending Web2\n\nYelp owns all of the restaurant reviews instead of restaurants and reviewers. If someone wants to compete with Yelp they have to start from scratch. If a restaurant decides they don’t like yelp anymore, they can’t easily take their reviews to a new app or platform without the reviews losing their credibility.\n\nIn contrast, when I build an app or website today I sit on the shoulders of giants. I have a seemingly infinite number of code packages, libraries, snippets, and APIs available to me, and I can use all of these tools to help me build things faster. I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I start a new project. However, if I want to build a competitor to Yelp, again, there is one major area where I have to start from scratch: the data and user base. Even if I scraped Yelp and ported all of their reviews, there’s no reason anyone should assume that the reviews are authentic, because they’ve been disconnected from their creators' accounts.\n\nA web3 version of Yelp, if it lives up to its promise, takes the data and infrastructure and makes it available to anyone while not being under the control of any single entity. Any developer can build a new UI for it. Instead of restaurants and users being tied down to one company, they are free to pick and choose whichever apps they please that connect to open protocols. We would no longer have a single company called Yelp. We would instead have an open and permanent protocol and database, and a potentially infinite number of Yelp competitors connected to it, all sharing the same data. Instead of competing with each other on who can hoard the most data, they would compete on their user experiences and services.\n\nYelp is a pretty inconsequential example. We can apply the same logic to public transportation networks like Uber and Lyft, or services like Airbnb, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, GoodReads, or your Twitter social graph.\n\nAs an Airbnb host, you can’t move platforms easily without losing the credibility of your reviews. you might have spent years building your review score, but now are stuck with a company that continues to increase their take rate, when you want desperately to move to a new platform. If both your listing and it’s reviews were on a neutral protocol similar in kind to something like [@LensProtocol](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol), you could seamlessly move to any competitor also building on the same protocol. In fact, you could exist on all platforms built on the same protocol simultaneously.\n\nOn Twitter, @liron [argues](https://twitter.com/liron/status/1531825233132277760) that the non-existence of a web3 Airbnb is evidence that not only is the project infeasible now but that almost nothing of value can be built here. And he’s right that none of these examples exist yet, but it doesn’t seem to me that we should assume they are impossible in principle. One example we can look at to confirm this is [ENS](http://ens.domains): all of the rules, domains and associated data live on the Ethereum blockchain. Any app can plug directly into the protocol and build their own services around it. People are doing this by building ENS specific [tools](https://ens.tools/domains) and no-fee [marketplaces](https://twitter.com/kodexapp). The Rainbow mobile app is doing this by allowing their users to [register ENS domains](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1536804795075502080) directly in their app. Any app ([and there are many](https://ens.domains/#home-ecosystem)) can pull the ENS data automatically and verify that a wallet owns a specific domain without needing to ask for permission. Granting the assumption that Ethereum is capable of scaling, there’s no difference between the domain names on ENS and the restaurant reviews on a hypothetical web3 version of Yelp, or the listings on a web3 version of Airbnb.\n\n## But what will all of this look like? What should we expect to see?\n\n**Scams. Lots and lots of scams.**\n\nThere’s more to say, of course, but I wanted to get the most obvious prediction out of the way at the outset: we should predict a lot of scams. Beyond that, I’m unfortunately incapable of predicting the future. But I enjoy envisioning it as much as the next science fiction fan. Thankfully, I don’t think it’s going to be too difficult to predict what web3 will look like over the coming years, because, well, a lot of it is already here.\n\nIf you own any NFTs or tokens, you can connect your wallet to any number of different sites and apps and see and manipulate your tokens in different ways. Some applications are special purpose, only surfacing specific types of tokens, while others, like NFT marketplaces, are more general and let you see everything. Depending on where you are, you can perform different actions, or unlock unique features, all dependent on what you hold in your wallet.\n\nI believe this trend will only accelerate, evidenced by [Instagrams recent NFT features](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/instagram-testing-nfts-select-creators/). Applications and companies of all types will issue NFTs and tokens for a multitude of purposes. Some may be valuable generally, but most will probably be highly specific and valuable only to you. This idea that NFTs are inherently investment vehicles couldn’t be more wrong. Over time, we’ll start to think of our wallets the same way Ash Ketchum thought of his Pokédex. You’ll move through the internet, from service to service, collecting unique items you can carry with you that perform different functions. And to state the obvious: everything here is highly speculative. Don’t be surprised if these are wrong. With that said, here’s a non-comprehensive list of things we should reasonably expect to see over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n* When you use an app to work out, if you connect your wallet, [you’ll get badges and awards as NFTs](https://metaverse.joinladder.com/). When you connect your wallet to your Instagram, these awards can automatically display on your profile, or get posted to your story. When you decide to test out another fitness app, you’ll connect your wallet, and be suggested the appropriate workouts based on your fitness level.\n* You’ll go to a concert and get a unique, [limited addition attendance NFT](https://poap.xyz/) from the band, which you can immediately post to your favorite social media app. Later, when the same band releases their next album, they might decide to give everyone holding their live attendance NFTs early access. You’ll go to their site and connect your wallet and prove to them that you went to their concert. The benefit for the artist to do this via an NFT instead of some other more traditional method is they can release the tickets themselves without relying on a third party ticket system like Ticketmaster. They can do this while ensuring that tickets in the future are authentic without managing and controlling the data themselves, or relying on another company doing it for them. \n* Using platforms like [Royal](https://royal.io/), musicians will tokenize their music allowing them to sell equity in their future earnings. They’ll sell a set number of tokens to investors and fans which capture a percentage of earnings from their music. By supporting your favorite artists, you’ll be able to take part in the upside of their success.\n* When you complete an online course and get a certificate, it’ll be issued as an NFT. You’ll connect your wallet to LinkedIn, and add the certificate to display on your profile. Now any time someone sees your profile they’ll see your certificate, and can easily click in to see who issued it and verify its authenticity.\n* When you buy a car or luxury watch, it will come with a proof of purchase and authenticity NFT. If you feel inclined to post a photo to Instagram (as so many do), you’ll post it along with the NFT, to give your content legitimacy. And when you decide to sell, you’ll post it online along with the NFT, to prove to people that they can trust that you do own the car, even if you’ve never sold anything before.\n* Currently, buying digital movies acts as a form of platform lock-in. We can imagine a different world where giant tech companies compete on the services they offer; when you buy a movie from Apple you could be given an NFT granting you the right to watch the movie on any streaming service. Apple would take a cut of the sale of course, but other platforms could compete with them, allowing you to move to different services taking your movies with you. And when the movie studio releases a new title, they can give discounts to everyone who owns one of their other movies. (I don’t believe the platforms are directly incentivized to do this one on their own, so I assume some external pressure would need to exist for this to be realized.)\n* When you play a video game, the items you pick up as you play the game will be issued as NFTs, and proof of their ownership will be capable of being brought with you outside of the game. Third-party apps will let you connect your wallet and verify the authenticity of your items, and allow you to do things with them on their external service, like trading and selling, all while ensuring that the original game creator takes a royalty on the sales. Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.\n* Your favorite charity will issue NFTs in exchange for your donations. Like the award NFTs given by the workout applications, you’ll be able to show off your charity donations on your social media profiles, simultaneously promoting your charity organization while signaling to your audience and friends. Charities will partner with other organizations and companies, offering special perks to their most philanthropic members. I heard this specific example as something that Sam Harris has wanted to do with one of his charities, however, I’m unaware of the status of the project.\n* Your favorite artist or content creator will release limited edition NFTs for their biggest fans. Ownership of one of these NFTs will give you special access to private groups where you get early access to content, and special access with the creator and other super fans. This will feel a lot like being part of a Patreon, with the important difference being that the content creator and their fans are untethered from any one specific platform. Currently, people who use Patreon are bound to it; they are under the total control of the platform. If they decide they no longer like Patreon, leaving isn’t an option, assuming they want to keep the majority of the fan base. NFT-based private groups change this. Anyone can build a platform that validates the NFTs owned by fans and allows them to come together as a private group. Each platform will compete on their UX and additional services they offer, instead of locking in creators and fans like we see today. If the content creator decides to move, everyone will be capable of transitioning seamlessly.\n* The NFTs that content creators sell online can be issued from special smart contracts that guarantee a % of future revenue made by the creator. This idea comes from a [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWTwcySGvrE) given by the head of Instagram, Adam Mosserri. At a basic level, the tokens sold by the content creators can act as equity in the creators' future earnings. As an example, a creator could sell 1,000 tokens, raising $100,000, in exchange for 10% of future earnings for the next 5 years. Platforms like Instagram, Youtube, etc. can read the smart contract and automatically distribute the revenue to the holders. Every time a check rolls in from Youtube, 90% goes to the content creator and 10% goes to the holders of their equity tokens. Every time the content creator signs up to a new platform, they’ll connect their wallet, allowing the new platform to automatically pick up the contract and execute it for any revenue that is made there.\n\nI could keep going. The examples I chose to present here are incredibly limited. But I hope you get the idea: what we can ultimately expect from web3, as I’ve presented, is the ability to generate or receive digital assets and objects which are capable of moving across the web seamlessly while maintaining their authenticity and history, without the need for issuers to stay in the loop or provide services to external parties who require authenticity. If I were to ever invoke the word “metaverse” it would be in regards to this very specific newly unlocked feature of the internet. It’s not about Facebook, specific mediums like AR or VR, or massive video game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite. The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using.\n\n## So, what problems does web3 solve?\n\n**Problem:** The data for {X} is under the total control of company {X}. If a user wants to migrate to a new service, they can’t bring their history with them in a way that retains its legitimacy. Company {X} doesn’t want to let them, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at scale in a way so {X} doesn’t maintain total control. See: Twitter API being public with companies built on it, only to be shut down by Twitter.\n\n**Solution:** Build an open immutable protocol and database that is not controlled by a single entity, like [Lens](https://lens.xyz/) and [ENS](http://ens.domains). The database and protocol will become the equivalent of a global utility, accessible and open to anyone for any purpose. Optional: release a governance token as a way to monetize and democratize control of the protocol.\n\n**Problem:** Real-world assets and certificates can’t be put online in a native way that allows them to be instantly validated, transferred, or used in any meaningful way. If I want to get a loan against my home or assets or prove to someone that I’m certified to do {X}, it won’t be as simple as clicking a button on a web form. The friction is too damn high.\n\n**Solution:** The entities that issue assets and certificates can issue NFTs that represent them. By looking at the issuer/history of an NFT and verifying their address or domain name, we can be confident that someone does own a specific asset regardless of what website we are using.\n\n**Problem:** Universal log-in, where you bring specific info with you to new apps and services, requires you to rely on a small number of giant tech companies - and the data you can bring with you is very limited and generally outside your control.\n\n**Solution:** [Private keys](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1389270115884097536)**,** [ENS](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1402388133086367751), and [Sign In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/).\n\n\n---\n\nI think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it.\n\nI think it might make the world more efficient if we were able to instantly verify the authenticity of assets, licenses, and certificates, without the need for every issuer to run massive APIs and authentication services. All one needs to do to ensure the authenticity of an asset is verify the identity and history of the issuer of its NFT.\n\nAnd I think it might make the internet better if we became less reliant on a handful of giant tech companies. Or, at the very least, it might be better if we were given the ability to walk away from them without the need to start again from zero.\n\n## What About the Critics?\n\nI don’t think there’s anything more divisive on the internet right now than web3, besides politics of course. There seems to be an unending number of [intelligent](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch) [people](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF) [who](https://twitter.com/liron) [believe](https://twitter.com/concodanomics) [that web3 is](https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin), [without doubt](https://twitter.com/davidgerard), [a giant scam](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/); that there isn’t a single redeeming quality about it. The bear market hasn’t exactly helped things. One of their main concerns is that web3 has almost certainly produced far more harm than not. You don’t have to [look far](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) to see hoards of people losing their life savings to a web3 Ponzi scheme. And on this specific point, I have to agree. Smart contracts are general purpose. And Ethereum is open and credibly neutral. Anyone can use it however they see fit. And unfortunately, the vast majority of builders are those who want to steal your money. However, it should be obvious that just because a technology has negative externalities doesn’t mean that we should discard the thing altogether. Their argument, if sound, would have to be that web3 only enables scams, and nothing else. As I’ve argued in this piece, I believe that because something like Ethereum is general purpose and credibly neutral, it enables anything to be built on top of it, both good and bad.\n\nThere are a lot of other issues people have with web3. There’s no way I’m going to be able to run through them all, for one because I agree with a lot of them, and also because there are just too many. However, I do want to tackle some of the most common that I see. A large majority of objections you’ll see are specifically for Bitcoin, like PoW mining, which I’m going to ignore, because, for the most part, I agree.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Just use a database. There’s nothing you need to use an NFT or blockchain for that you can’t do with a normal database.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Ethereum is a globally distributed computer that requires a scarce resource to run which it both creates and destroys as it is used. As a consequence of desiring to use the machine for any reason, we naturally find ourselves valuing the resource, which incentivizes others to run it and keep it alive. It’s this incredible property that gives us assurance that it’s going to be around for a long time. It’s a permanent database anyone can use, while no single entity is solely responsible for keeping it running. Anyone can plug into the database, check its’ state, and be confident that it’s accurate. This is fundamentally different than a traditional database and opens up a whole new world of opportunities. If I don’t want my digital objects to exist and persist outside of my involvement, or be capable of moving across the web without continuing to build special purpose integrations, then a normal database is perfect. However, there are cases where the ability to set and forget something, or ensure authenticity is continually preserved is desirable. I want to be able to add something to the chain, leave it there for 50 years, and come back knowing it hasn’t changed. Proof of ownership is an obvious candidate for this functionality.\n\n**OBJECTION:** To parrot [Liron](https://twitter.com/liron): no one will want any of this. You aren’t solving real problems.\n\n**RESPONSE:** In principle, we can use Ethereum to build anything. Granting the assumption that something like Ethereum is capable of sufficiently scaling in the coming years while remaining both trustworthy and general-purpose, we should believe that solving real problems is possible if they exist, and as I’ve argued, I believe they do.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Crypto is just a Ponzi scheme filled with more Ponzi schemes. There’s nothing real there worth paying attention to.\n\n**RESPONSE:** I agree that crypto is filled with Ponzi schemes and other horrible scams and nonsense. And while people may use crypto to solely build Ponzi schemes and nothing else, it seems reasonable to believe that non-Ponzi products are also possible. This is reasonable because just as we can easily point to [Scams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), we can also easily point to non-scams, like the no-loss lottery protocol [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), social protocols like [lens](https://lens.xyz/), the domain name service [ENS](http://ens.domains), and the borrowing and lending platforms [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/). Also, I think there’s an important distinction to be made between Layer one networks like Ethereum and the protocols and apps built on top of them. The Ethereum network is a global computer anyone can use to build protocols on. If everyone used Ethereum to build scams, it still wouldn’t mean that Ethereum itself is a Ponzi or scam, because the door would still be open for someone to build something useful on top of it.\n\n**OBJECTION:** [The Moxie Objection](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). One of the best criticisms I’ve seen has come from the CEO of Signal, Moxie, who makes a clear case for why we might not want to be so optimistic about this. The main claim that I want to focus on here is that web3 isn’t a great improvement from what we’ve seen before, because just like web2 is centralized around a handful of giant companies, like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, web3 isn’t doing any better. While it might look like you can use any wallet you want, and any app can plug directly into protocols on-chain, he says, behind the scenes, there are only one or two companies that everyone is plugging into. Everyone is using Infura and Alchemy to get data from the chain and using Opensea to pull NFT metadata. His takeaway and core criticism is that web3 is building centralizing forces even faster than we saw with web2.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Each centralizing force and entity he points to such as Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea, are not gatekeepers to the data on-chain. The state of the network is open for anyone to access, explore, and use as they please by simply running a node. What Moxie didn’t explain well is that Infura and alchemy simply run Ethereum nodes, which anyone can do, and then provides easy to use interfaces into them for developers. Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea can all be replaced easily and with little barrier to entry. Clients could decide tomorrow that they are no longer aligned with them, and pick new data providers without issue. If you try building with Infura or Alchemy, you’ll see that the interfaces are in fact quite primitive, and while we can expect them to improve, over the coming years we should expect new providers to come onto the scene who offer better services and interfaces into the Ethereum network. We can already see this happening with companies like [Moralis](https://moralis.io). This is not the case with any of the giant web2 companies. Their databases are closed off, and only accessible if you ask them for permission. If you get cut off, there’s no way for you to access the data. They are impossible to compete against let alone replace, because they act as gatekeepers to the data they collect, further locking users into their ecosystem.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of problems still open to be solved. But I have yet to see one that I believe is even likely to be insurmountable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTwitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols. And we know this, because we have real-world examples like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ENS](http://ens.domains), [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), [Lens](https://lens.xyz/), and many others.\n\n\n---\n\nMine is a single answer in a sea of others. There doesn’t seem to be much consensus on what web3 is, let alone what problems it will solve. It doesn’t help that people seem to have gone insane and come under a trance trading hyper-inflated cartoon images. My view is that web3 solves different problems for different people. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum are general-purpose, meaning the protocols and services that can be built on them are near-infinite, and what people will do with them is unpredictable, like trade cartoon JPEGs.\n\nPeople look at web3 and see the hyper-financialization of everything. And this is true; all on-chain assets can instantly be given their own stock market. They see cartoon apes trading for amounts that can only be explained by a world that has collectively lost its mind. And I don’t have good explanations for why that is, or what’s causing masses of people to lose touch with reality. However, if we put aside this [Problem With NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g)s, squint hard and look toward what we have unlocked beyond the insanity and hype, I believe we might see something real and historically important. The large-scale benefits are probably a little further down the road than I’m capable of predicting, but we might see a world that is made more [efficient by the replacement of trust in crumbling institutions and giant tech companies with cryptographic truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuvsLNCg-Y).\n\n*fin*\n\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: as you might have guessed, I’m kind of an Ethereum maximalist. I’ll probably write about why in another post.*\n\n\n---\n\nFAQ\n\n* Q: Aren’t you using web3 as a synonym for NFTs? \n A: When I was using the term \"web3\", I was referring to this new ability to build protocols and shared databases. An NFT is just a specific type of object in those databases that conforms to a standard. Conforming to that standard when building these protocols is optional, depending on what you want to do. Following the NFT standard simply ensures your items are compatible with other protocols. There are even different types of NFTs standards you can create, and you aren't limited to only creating NFTs. Imo we've barely scratched the surface exploring what we can do.", "timestamp": 1655696930, "digest": "-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg", "contributor": "0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D"}

{"id": "E9-nuJ7RH7r1KL1eny800trdMSRPiB-cGtVggtDwfVA", "title": "What Problem Does Web3 Solve, Anyway?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zl272m8PrjRBlG02jbAeR.png?height=925&width=1055)\n\nI want to start this post off by stating that I have very little interest in freakishly expensive cartoon animal JPEGs, private Discord servers, or hexagon profile photos. When people think of web3, or look at what the “people in web3” are doing, outside of direct scams this is generally what they see. It looks as though the highest achievement of this third web is that the rich and famous have been given a new way to show everyone how disconnected they are from reality. And they are. I don’t have a lot of explanations for it, and while I too got caught up and enamored with expensive cartoons during the peak of the mania, I have no desire to rationalize any of it away. Instead, for this post, I want to look beyond it.\n\nMy view of web3 is that it offers an important unlock for software developers. It allows them to build and consume general-purpose, open, permanent protocols and APIs that are paid for by their consumers in real-time. These protocols and APIs provide a universal database that can be used by anyone. It allows for permanent, unique objects that can be taken anywhere across the internet without losing sight of their owners, creators, and history. If ape JPEGs are a terrible cartoon use case for this new unlock, what other real-world use cases might be more exciting?\n\nMost real-world web3 protocols and apps right now (that aren’t scams) are financial, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for trading assets, [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for getting yield on assets, and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) for borrowing and lending. At first glance, we might simply see new ways for degenerates to gamble. And we’d be right. If we change lenses, however, and simply look at what has been built we’ll see open protocols that anyone can build a frontend for without the need to ask for API keys. They can be incorporated into anything and remixed by anyone. And, if the promise of holds, they can't be shut down or their data corrupted.\n\nTo build other non-financial services at scale, we’re going to need to batch transactions saving users on insanely high transaction costs. [This is happening](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/), however, for the rest of this post, I want to ignore that. This post won’t talk about scaling solutions or different chains or throw obscure silly technical terms at you. Instead, I just want to answer the questions: “What problem does web3 solve, anyway? What will it look like?”\n\n[Web3, Explained](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1535377548388945920)\n\n> *TL;DR: Web3 offers a general-purpose way to represent ownership of data, assets, and certificates that maintain their authenticity, history, and ownership state across the web.*\n\n## The Limits of Web2\n\nAsset titles, licenses, and certificates can't live on the internet easily in a truly meaningful and native way. If you do put them online, there’s very little one can do to ensure they are authentic or valid, especially if you want them to remain authentic across platforms without building special-purpose APIs and integrations. Allowing their ownership and control to be easily transferred between different people and applications is also not trivial.\n\nIf you graduated from Harvard and you want this achievement displayed on some online profile in a way that can be easily verified, Harvard would need to build and host an API that exposes their alumni list mapped to user accounts in their database, as well as a way for apps to authenticate their users to ensure that they are who they say they are. And Harvard would need to pay a full-time team to maintain these services. And all the apps that want to get this data would need to create a developer account with the Harvard Web Services and get an API key to ensure they don't spam the service. Assuming that anyone would want this for any reason, it’s entirely infeasible and almost certainly not worth the effort.\n\nInstead, we can simplify the entire thing by schools issuing an NFT to students. So long as an app or user knows Harvards wallet address or domain name, they can verify that someone does have a real degree from Harvard, and it will work as well as someone’s ability to currently verify that someone has a “real ape NFT”. The amount of effort this would take is trivial.\n\nExpand this Harvard example, which is incredibly general, to certificates and licenses in general. Companies want to build applications connecting licensed individuals who hold certificates with their clients, while removing manual verifications and minimizing fake accounts. NFTs allow us to do this without requiring issuers to build and maintain specialized APIs and integrations on a case by case basis.\n\nAs far as I can tell, bringing real-world assets and certificates online in a truly native way is incredibly powerful. Currently, if you are issued a certificate that says you are licensed to do {X}, the certificate can only be brought online within the confines of the issuer. You have to log onto their website/app to see any version that other people will trust. If other applications or people want to verify it outside of their site, the issuer has to build an API and service allowing you to authenticate yourself and verify it, or worse, email the issuer manually. The issuer has to host, serve, and control the certificate, and there’s no way for you to take control of it and bring it with you anywhere you want online, without each platform building special-purpose integrations for you. Instead, if a certificate issuer gives you an NFT representing your certificate, you can bring it with you anywhere so long as you can connect your wallet. Your real-estate, hairdressing, law, financial advisor, etc. licenses can all be posted to the top of your Instagram page automatically, allowing anyone to trivially check who issued it and verify its authenticity. All that is required is that you connect your wallet.\n\nBased on many conversions I’ve had, people seem to be easily confused by this concept. “What makes one NFT authentic and others not?”, they ask. “Anyone can create an NFT of anything. I can create an NFT that looks exactly like all of the other real-estate licenses and post it to my Instagram. Who’s to say mine is fake? How would anyone know?” The answer is identity and provenance.\n\nFor something to be considered authentic, we need to know where it came from. In the art world, this concept is known as provenance, and NFTs give us perfect provenance. When I look at the real-estate license NFT on your Instagram account, I’ll be able to click into it and see its token ID, the contract/collection it belongs to, and who issued it. And if it wasn’t issued by NMLS, then I can be near certain that it’s a fake. If I’m feeling extra suspicious, I can open a second application like Etherscan and confirm. I’ll be able to see that you issued it to yourself.  The fact that I am not relying on Instagram here is key. The data isn’t on instagram; it’s on a neutral permanent database called Ethereum. The same applies to Nike shoes, art, home titles, etc. If Instagram were so inclined, it could choose to control a list of verified wallets, so that NFTs issued by NMLS and Nike would automatically show a check mark, while others wouldn’t.\n\n## Extending Web2\n\nYelp owns all of the restaurant reviews instead of restaurants and reviewers. If someone wants to compete with Yelp they have to start from scratch. If a restaurant decides they don’t like yelp anymore, they can’t easily take their reviews to a new app or platform without the reviews losing their credibility.\n\nIn contrast, when I build an app or website today I sit on the shoulders of giants. I have a seemingly infinite number of code packages, libraries, snippets, and APIs available to me, and I can use all of these tools to help me build things faster. I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I start a new project. However, if I want to build a competitor to Yelp, again, there is one major area where I have to start from scratch: the data and user base. Even if I scraped Yelp and ported all of their reviews, there’s no reason anyone should assume that the reviews are authentic, because they’ve been disconnected from their creators' accounts.\n\nA web3 version of Yelp, if it lives up to its promise, takes the data and infrastructure and makes it available to anyone while not being under the control of any single entity. Any developer can build a new UI for it. Instead of restaurants and users being tied down to one company, they are free to pick and choose whichever apps they please that connect to open protocols. We would no longer have a single company called Yelp. We would instead have an open and permanent protocol and database, and a potentially infinite number of Yelp competitors connected to it, all sharing the same data. Instead of competing with each other on who can hoard the most data, they would compete on their user experiences and services.\n\nYelp is a pretty inconsequential example. We can apply the same logic to public transportation networks like Uber and Lyft, or services like Airbnb, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, GoodReads, or your Twitter social graph.\n\nAs an Airbnb host, you can’t move platforms easily without losing the credibility of your reviews. you might have spent years building your review score, but now are stuck with a company that continues to increase their take rate, when you want desperately to move to a new platform. If both your listing and it’s reviews were on a neutral protocol similar in kind to something like [@LensProtocol](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol), you could seamlessly move to any competitor also building on the same protocol. In fact, you could exist on all platforms built on the same protocol simultaneously.\n\nOn Twitter, @liron [argues](https://twitter.com/liron/status/1531825233132277760) that the non-existence of a web3 Airbnb is evidence that not only is the project infeasible now but that almost nothing of value can be built here. And he’s right that none of these examples exist yet, but it doesn’t seem to me that we should assume they are impossible in principle. One example we can look at to confirm this is [ENS](http://ens.domains): all of the rules, domains and associated data live on the Ethereum blockchain. Any app can plug directly into the protocol and build their own services around it. People are doing this by building ENS specific [tools](https://ens.tools/domains) and no-fee [marketplaces](https://twitter.com/kodexapp). The Rainbow mobile app is doing this by allowing their users to [register ENS domains](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1536804795075502080) directly in their app. Any app ([and there are many](https://ens.domains/#home-ecosystem)) can pull the ENS data automatically and verify that a wallet owns a specific domain without needing to ask for permission. Granting the assumption that Ethereum is capable of scaling, there’s no difference between the domain names on ENS and the restaurant reviews on a hypothetical web3 version of Yelp, or the listings on a web3 version of Airbnb.\n\n## But what will all of this look like? What should we expect to see?\n\n**Scams. Lots and lots of scams.**\n\nThere’s more to say, of course, but I wanted to get the most obvious prediction out of the way at the outset: we should predict a lot of scams. Beyond that, I’m unfortunately incapable of predicting the future. But I enjoy envisioning it as much as the next science fiction fan. Thankfully, I don’t think it’s going to be too difficult to predict what web3 will look like over the coming years, because, well, a lot of it is already here.\n\nIf you own any NFTs or tokens, you can connect your wallet to any number of different sites and apps and see and manipulate your tokens in different ways. Some applications are special purpose, only surfacing specific types of tokens, while others, like NFT marketplaces, are more general and let you see everything. Depending on where you are, you can perform different actions, or unlock unique features, all dependent on what you hold in your wallet.\n\nI believe this trend will only accelerate, evidenced by [Instagrams recent NFT features](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/instagram-testing-nfts-select-creators/). Applications and companies of all types will issue NFTs and tokens for a multitude of purposes. Some may be valuable generally, but most will probably be highly specific and valuable only to you. This idea that NFTs are inherently investment vehicles couldn’t be more wrong. Over time, we’ll start to think of our wallets the same way Ash Ketchum thought of his Pokédex. You’ll move through the internet, from service to service, collecting unique items you can carry with you that perform different functions. And to state the obvious: everything here is highly speculative. Don’t be surprised if these are wrong. With that said, here’s a non-comprehensive list of things we should reasonably expect to see over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n* When you use an app to work out, if you connect your wallet, [you’ll get badges and awards as NFTs](https://metaverse.joinladder.com/). When you connect your wallet to your Instagram, these awards can automatically display on your profile, or get posted to your story. When you decide to test out another fitness app, you’ll connect your wallet, and be suggested the appropriate workouts based on your fitness level.\n* You’ll go to a concert and get a unique, [limited addition attendance NFT](https://poap.xyz/) from the band, which you can immediately post to your favorite social media app. Later, when the same band releases their next album, they might decide to give everyone holding their live attendance NFTs early access. You’ll go to their site and connect your wallet and prove to them that you went to their concert. The benefit for the artist to do this via an NFT instead of some other more traditional method is they can release the tickets themselves without relying on a third party ticket system like Ticketmaster. They can do this while ensuring that tickets in the future are authentic without managing and controlling the data themselves, or relying on another company doing it for them. \n* Using platforms like [Royal](https://royal.io/), musicians will tokenize their music allowing them to sell equity in their future earnings. They’ll sell a set number of tokens to investors and fans which capture a percentage of earnings from their music. By supporting your favorite artists, you’ll be able to take part in the upside of their success.\n* When you complete an online course and get a certificate, it’ll be issued as an NFT. You’ll connect your wallet to LinkedIn, and add the certificate to display on your profile. Now any time someone sees your profile they’ll see your certificate, and can easily click in to see who issued it and verify its authenticity.\n* When you buy a car or luxury watch, it will come with a proof of purchase and authenticity NFT. If you feel inclined to post a photo to Instagram (as so many do), you’ll post it along with the NFT, to give your content legitimacy. And when you decide to sell, you’ll post it online along with the NFT, to prove to people that they can trust that you do own the car, even if you’ve never sold anything before.\n* Currently, buying digital movies acts as a form of platform lock-in. We can imagine a different world where giant tech companies compete on the services they offer; when you buy a movie from Apple you could be given an NFT granting you the right to watch the movie on any streaming service. Apple would take a cut of the sale of course, but other platforms could compete with them, allowing you to move to different services taking your movies with you. And when the movie studio releases a new title, they can give discounts to everyone who owns one of their other movies. (I don’t believe the platforms are directly incentivized to do this one on their own, so I assume some external pressure would need to exist for this to be realized.)\n* When you play a video game, the items you pick up as you play the game will be issued as NFTs, and proof of their ownership will be capable of being brought with you outside of the game. Third-party apps will let you connect your wallet and verify the authenticity of your items, and allow you to do things with them on their external service, like trading and selling, all while ensuring that the original game creator takes a royalty on the sales. Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.\n* Your favorite charity will issue NFTs in exchange for your donations. Like the award NFTs given by the workout applications, you’ll be able to show off your charity donations on your social media profiles, simultaneously promoting your charity organization while signaling to your audience and friends. Charities will partner with other organizations and companies, offering special perks to their most philanthropic members. I heard this specific example as something that Sam Harris has wanted to do with one of his charities, however, I’m unaware of the status of the project.\n* Your favorite artist or content creator will release limited edition NFTs for their biggest fans. Ownership of one of these NFTs will give you special access to private groups where you get early access to content, and special access with the creator and other super fans. This will feel a lot like being part of a Patreon, with the important difference being that the content creator and their fans are untethered from any one specific platform. Currently, people who use Patreon are bound to it; they are under the total control of the platform. If they decide they no longer like Patreon, leaving isn’t an option, assuming they want to keep the majority of the fan base. NFT-based private groups change this. Anyone can build a platform that validates the NFTs owned by fans and allows them to come together as a private group. Each platform will compete on their UX and additional services they offer, instead of locking in creators and fans like we see today. If the content creator decides to move, everyone will be capable of transitioning seamlessly.\n* The NFTs that content creators sell online can be issued from special smart contracts that guarantee a % of future revenue made by the creator. This idea comes from a [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWTwcySGvrE) given by the head of Instagram, Adam Mosserri. At a basic level, the tokens sold by the content creators can act as equity in the creators' future earnings. As an example, a creator could sell 1,000 tokens, raising $100,000, in exchange for 10% of future earnings for the next 5 years. Platforms like Instagram, Youtube, etc. can read the smart contract and automatically distribute the revenue to the holders. Every time a check rolls in from Youtube, 90% goes to the content creator and 10% goes to the holders of their equity tokens. Every time the content creator signs up to a new platform, they’ll connect their wallet, allowing the new platform to automatically pick up the contract and execute it for any revenue that is made there.\n\nI could keep going. The examples I chose to present here are incredibly limited. But I hope you get the idea: what we can ultimately expect from web3, as I’ve presented, is the ability to generate or receive digital assets and objects which are capable of moving across the web seamlessly while maintaining their authenticity and history, without the need for issuers to stay in the loop or provide services to external parties who require authenticity. If I were to ever invoke the word “metaverse” it would be in regards to this very specific newly unlocked feature of the internet. It’s not about Facebook, specific mediums like AR or VR, or massive video game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite. The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using.\n\n## So, what problems does web3 solve?\n\n**Problem:** The data for {X} is under the total control of company {X}. If a user wants to migrate to a new service, they can’t bring their history with them in a way that retains its legitimacy. Company {X} doesn’t want to let them, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at scale in a way so {X} doesn’t maintain total control. See: Twitter API being public with companies built on it, only to be shut down by Twitter.\n\n**Solution:** Build an open immutable protocol and database that is not controlled by a single entity, like [Lens](https://lens.xyz/) and [ENS](http://ens.domains). The database and protocol will become the equivalent of a global utility, accessible and open to anyone for any purpose. Optional: release a governance token as a way to monetize and democratize control of the protocol.\n\n**Problem:** Real-world assets and certificates can’t be put online in a native way that allows them to be instantly validated, transferred, or used in any meaningful way. If I want to get a loan against my home or assets or prove to someone that I’m certified to do {X}, it won’t be as simple as clicking a button on a web form. The friction is too damn high.\n\n**Solution:** The entities that issue assets and certificates can issue NFTs that represent them. By looking at the issuer/history of an NFT and verifying their address or domain name, we can be confident that someone does own a specific asset regardless of what website we are using.\n\n**Problem:** Universal log-in, where you bring specific info with you to new apps and services, requires you to rely on a small number of giant tech companies - and the data you can bring with you is very limited and generally outside your control.\n\n**Solution:** [Private keys](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1389270115884097536)**,** [ENS](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1402388133086367751), and [Sign In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/).\n\n\n---\n\nI think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it.\n\nI think it might make the world more efficient if we were able to instantly verify the authenticity of assets, licenses, and certificates, without the need for every issuer to run massive APIs and authentication services. All one needs to do to ensure the authenticity of an asset is verify the identity and history of the issuer of its NFT.\n\nAnd I think it might make the internet better if we became less reliant on a handful of giant tech companies. Or, at the very least, it might be better if we were given the ability to walk away from them without the need to start again from zero.\n\n## What About the Critics?\n\nI don’t think there’s anything more divisive on the internet right now than web3, besides politics of course. There seems to be an unending number of [intelligent](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch) [people](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF) [who](https://twitter.com/liron) [believe](https://twitter.com/concodanomics) [that web3 is](https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin), [without doubt](https://twitter.com/davidgerard), [a giant scam](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/); that there isn’t a single redeeming quality about it. The bear market hasn’t exactly helped things. One of their main concerns is that web3 has almost certainly produced far more harm than not. You don’t have to [look far](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) to see hoards of people losing their life savings to a web3 Ponzi scheme. And on this specific point, I have to agree. Smart contracts are general purpose. And Ethereum is open and credibly neutral. Anyone can use it however they see fit. And unfortunately, the vast majority of builders are those who want to steal your money. However, it should be obvious that just because a technology has negative externalities doesn’t mean that we should discard the thing altogether. Their argument, if sound, would have to be that web3 only enables scams, and nothing else. As I’ve argued in this piece, I believe that because something like Ethereum is general purpose and credibly neutral, it enables anything to be built on top of it, both good and bad.\n\nThere are a lot of other issues people have with web3. There’s no way I’m going to be able to run through them all, for one because I agree with a lot of them, and also because there are just too many. However, I do want to tackle some of the most common that I see. A large majority of objections you’ll see are specifically for Bitcoin, like PoW mining, which I’m going to ignore, because, for the most part, I agree.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Just use a database. There’s nothing you need to use an NFT or blockchain for that you can’t do with a normal database.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Ethereum is a globally distributed computer that requires a scarce resource to run which it both creates and destroys as it is used. As a consequence of desiring to use the machine for any reason, we naturally find ourselves valuing the resource, which incentivizes others to run it and keep it alive. It’s this incredible property that gives us assurance that it’s going to be around for a long time. It’s a permanent database anyone can use, while no single entity is solely responsible for keeping it running. Anyone can plug into the database, check its’ state, and be confident that it’s accurate. This is fundamentally different than a traditional database and opens up a whole new world of opportunities. If I don’t want my digital objects to exist and persist outside of my involvement, or be capable of moving across the web without continuing to build special purpose integrations, then a normal database is perfect. However, there are cases where the ability to set and forget something, or ensure authenticity is continually preserved is desirable. I want to be able to add something to the chain, leave it there for 50 years, and come back knowing it hasn’t changed. Proof of ownership is an obvious candidate for this functionality.\n\n**OBJECTION:** To parrot [Liron](https://twitter.com/liron): no one will want any of this. You aren’t solving real problems.\n\n**RESPONSE:** In principle, we can use Ethereum to build anything. Granting the assumption that something like Ethereum is capable of sufficiently scaling in the coming years while remaining both trustworthy and general-purpose, we should believe that solving real problems is possible if they exist, and as I’ve argued, I believe they do.\n\n**OBJECTION:** Crypto is just a Ponzi scheme filled with more Ponzi schemes. There’s nothing real there worth paying attention to.\n\n**RESPONSE:** I agree that crypto is filled with Ponzi schemes and other horrible scams and nonsense. And while people may use crypto to solely build Ponzi schemes and nothing else, it seems reasonable to believe that non-Ponzi products are also possible. This is reasonable because just as we can easily point to [Scams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), we can also easily point to non-scams, like the no-loss lottery protocol [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), social protocols like [lens](https://lens.xyz/), the domain name service [ENS](http://ens.domains), and the borrowing and lending platforms [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/). Also, I think there’s an important distinction to be made between Layer one networks like Ethereum and the protocols and apps built on top of them. The Ethereum network is a global computer anyone can use to build protocols on. If everyone used Ethereum to build scams, it still wouldn’t mean that Ethereum itself is a Ponzi or scam, because the door would still be open for someone to build something useful on top of it.\n\n**OBJECTION:** [The Moxie Objection](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). One of the best criticisms I’ve seen has come from the CEO of Signal, Moxie, who makes a clear case for why we might not want to be so optimistic about this. The main claim that I want to focus on here is that web3 isn’t a great improvement from what we’ve seen before, because just like web2 is centralized around a handful of giant companies, like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, web3 isn’t doing any better. While it might look like you can use any wallet you want, and any app can plug directly into protocols on-chain, he says, behind the scenes, there are only one or two companies that everyone is plugging into. Everyone is using Infura and Alchemy to get data from the chain and using Opensea to pull NFT metadata. His takeaway and core criticism is that web3 is building centralizing forces even faster than we saw with web2.\n\n**RESPONSE:** Each centralizing force and entity he points to such as Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea, are not gatekeepers to the data on-chain. The state of the network is open for anyone to access, explore, and use as they please by simply running a node. What Moxie didn’t explain well is that Infura and alchemy simply run Ethereum nodes, which anyone can do, and then provides easy to use interfaces into them for developers. Infura, Alchemy, and Opensea can all be replaced easily and with little barrier to entry. Clients could decide tomorrow that they are no longer aligned with them, and pick new data providers without issue. If you try building with Infura or Alchemy, you’ll see that the interfaces are in fact quite primitive, and while we can expect them to improve, over the coming years we should expect new providers to come onto the scene who offer better services and interfaces into the Ethereum network. We can already see this happening with companies like [Moralis](https://moralis.io). This is not the case with any of the giant web2 companies. Their databases are closed off, and only accessible if you ask them for permission. If you get cut off, there’s no way for you to access the data. They are impossible to compete against let alone replace, because they act as gatekeepers to the data they collect, further locking users into their ecosystem.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of problems still open to be solved. But I have yet to see one that I believe is even likely to be insurmountable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTwitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols. And we know this, because we have real-world examples like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [ENS](http://ens.domains), [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/), [Lens](https://lens.xyz/), and many others.\n\n\n---\n\nMine is a single answer in a sea of others. There doesn’t seem to be much consensus on what web3 is, let alone what problems it will solve. It doesn’t help that people seem to have gone insane and come under a trance trading hyper-inflated cartoon images. My view is that web3 solves different problems for different people. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum are general-purpose, meaning the protocols and services that can be built on them are near-infinite, and what people will do with them is unpredictable, like trade cartoon JPEGs.\n\nPeople look at web3 and see the hyper-financialization of everything. And this is true; all on-chain assets can instantly be given their own stock market. They see cartoon apes trading for amounts that can only be explained by a world that has collectively lost its mind. And I don’t have good explanations for why that is, or what’s causing masses of people to lose touch with reality. However, if we put aside this [Problem With NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g)s, squint hard and look toward what we have unlocked beyond the insanity and hype, I believe we might see something real and historically important. The large-scale benefits are probably a little further down the road than I’m capable of predicting, but we might see a world that is made more [efficient by the replacement of trust in crumbling institutions and giant tech companies with cryptographic truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuvsLNCg-Y).\n\n*fin*\n\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: as you might have guessed, I’m kind of an Ethereum maximalist. I’ll probably write about why in another post.*\n\n\n---\n\nFAQ\n\n* Q: Aren’t you using web3 as a synonym for NFTs? \n A: When I was using the term \"web3\", I was referring to this new ability to build protocols and shared databases. An NFT is just a specific type of object in those databases that conforms to a standard. Conforming to that standard when building these protocols is optional, depending on what you want to do. Following the NFT standard simply ensures your items are compatible with other protocols. There are even different types of NFTs standards you can create, and you aren't limited to only creating NFTs. Imo we've barely scratched the surface exploring what we can do.", "timestamp": 1655697192, "digest": "-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg", "contributor": "0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D"}

{"id": "-5-CPstceNro7pNgZu22x8HL_LN00Rj63wXIxI628rU", "title": "\nEl Salvador: El Bitcoin No es Dinero", "body": "En un [estudio](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf) reciente, Fernando Álvarez (de la Universidad de Chicago), David Argente (de la Universidad Estatal de Pensilvania) y Diana van Patten examinaron la adopción del [bitcoin](https://cashessentials.org/glossary/bitcoin/?lang=es) en los pagos al menudeo en El Salvador. A partir de los datos de una encuesta representativa a nivel nacional, realizada en persona a 1,800 hogares con CID-Gallup, la conclusión de los economistas es clara: “el bitcoin no se está utilizando ampliamente como medio de intercambio” (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 19).\n\n# EL EFECTIVO ES INCLUYENTE\n\nEntre las razones para hacer del bitcoin una moneda de curso legal en El Salvador, el presidente [Nayib Bukele](https://cashessentials.org/comprando-el-chapuzon-el-salvador-hace-a-bitcoin-moneda-de-curso-legal/?lang=es) argumentó que el criptoactivo promovería la inclusión financiera en el país. Los salvadoreños mayores de edad pueden descargar el monedero electrónico Chivo precargado con 30 dólares de bitcoin gratis. Los usuarios de Chivo pueden tener bitcoin y dólares en sus carteras y comerciar con bitcoin sin comisiones.\n\nSin embargo, los usuarios típicos de Chivo son “individuos que poseen un teléfono celular con internet, y aquellos que están bancarizados, están más educados, son más jóvenes y son hombres” (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 12, cita en 13). La mayoría de los salvadoreños descargaron Chivo para convertir el bono de 30 dólares en bitcoin a [dólares físicos](https://cashessentials.org/el-fantasma-en-la-pupusa-pagando-con-bitcoin-en-el-salvador/?lang=es), según la encuesta de CID-Gallup y las fuentes entrevistadas por el [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/5972099a-8a8c-4a85-8216-912cd78b710b) y el [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831) (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 15-16).  Las descargas de Chivo alcanzaron un máximo durante su lanzamiento en septiembre de 2021 (con un 40%) y se han reducido casi a cero desde entonces.\n\n* “Va a ser un verdadero reto para mí entender esas cosas \\[el bitcoin\\]. Especialmente porque soy analfabeto”, dijo [Louis Robles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831?page=1), un pescador de 42 años y operador turístico de barcos en La Unión, un puerto cercano a la planeada (y retrasada) [Ciudad Bitcoin](https://cashessentials.org/el-salvador-apuesta-la-casa-con-bitcoin/?lang=es).\n* “No, no le entiendo. Lo hallo \\[el bitcoin\\] bien difícil de entender”, dijo [Ana Aracely Flores](https://www.wsj.com/articles/el-salvador-to-issue-bitcoin-bond-in-2022-11637616550?mod=article_inline), residente en San Salvador.\n\nAunque la mayoría de los encuestados por CID-Gallup (64.6%) tiene acceso a un teléfono móvil, esto no ha sido suficiente para promover la adopción de Chivo entre la población del país (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 10).\n\n> “Mucha gente no tiene smartphones, y si los tiene, no tiene planes de datos”, dijo [Santiago Pérez](https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-erdogan-meets-el-salvadors-bitcoin-boosting-leader-amid-economic-crisis-11642678083), editor adjunto del WSJ para América Latina.\n\n# EL EFECTIVO ES CONFIABLE\n\nLos comerciantes y los clientes rara vez, o nunca, emplean el bitcoin en los pagos al por menor. Una encuesta de la [Universidad Centroamericana](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf) indica que el 70% de los salvadoreños confía poco o nada en el bitcoin como moneda de curso legal, y el 58% piensa que el bitcoin beneficia a “inversionistas extranjeros, ricos y empresarios” ([IUOP 2021](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf): 10-11, 20-21).\n\nLa ciudad surfera de [El Zonte](https://cashessentials.org/comprando-el-chapuzon-el-salvador-hace-a-bitcoin-moneda-de-curso-legal/?lang=es), también conocida como “Bitcoin Beach”, parece ser la única excepción. Los turistas extranjeros pagan clases de surf y pupusas en bitcoin. “La mayoría de los comerciantes aceptan Bitcoin”, dice [Carol Souza](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-travel-strategies-crypto-vacations-11648221573?page=1), una influencer brasileña y criptoevangelista que visita la ciudad. [Adrian Torres](https://www.wsj.com/story/el-salvador-asks-can-bitcoin-be-a-nations-currency-7f68a033?page=1), residente en El Zonte, comprueba el valor del bitcoin en el monedero Chivo cada vez que recibe un pago en el criptoactivo.\n\n**Cuadro 1**. El Salvador: Uso de efectivo y tarjetas de pago entre los usuarios de Chivo\n\n**Nota**: La muestra comprende los usuarios que descargaron la aplicación Chivo. **Fuente**: Álvarez et al. ([2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 22).\n\nEntre los que descargaron la aplicación, la mayoría siguió utilizando el dinero en efectivo (70%) y las tarjetas de débito y crédito (83%) en las mismas proporciones que antes (véase el **Cuadro 1**). La mayoría de los salvadoreños (60.7%) dejaron de usar Chivo después de gastar el bono de 30 dólares (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 15).\n\n> “Creemos que esta es una señal relativamente fuerte de adopción”, dijo [Felipe Vallejo](https://cointelegraph.com/news/el-salvador-bitcoin-wallet-shows-strong-sign-of-adoption-exec-says), jefe de asuntos corporativos y regulatorios de Bitso, una [plataforma de criptoactivos](https://cashessentials.org/el-crimen-paga-en-cripto/?lang=es) mexicana y proveedora de tecnología del gobierno salvadoreño.\n\n# EL EFECTIVO ES SEGURO\n\n> “Somos un pueblo al que le gusta tocar su dinero”, dice [Danilo Martínez](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831?page=1), operador de una línea de taxis en San Salvador.\n\nAlgunos usuarios de Chivo han denunciado cargos no autorizados, esquemas de phishing y robos de identidad. Cristosal, un grupo de defensa de los derechos de los consumidores, ha recogido las firmas de más de 1,000 salvadoreños que afirman que sus identidades y fondos fueron robados a través de Chivo, según la abogada [Ruth López](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831). Y lo que es peor, pandilleros han extorsionado a 2.3% de los salvadoreños para que transfieran su bono de 30 dólares de Chivo ([IUOP 2021](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf): 8, 27).\n\nSegún la encuesta de CID-Gallup, casi todas las empresas aceptan pagos en efectivo, algo más del 25% aceptan tarjetas de débito y crédito, y sólo el 20% aceptan bitcoin. Entre las empresas que aceptan bitcoin en los pagos, el 71% convierte los fondos de la criptomoneda en dólares y luego los retira en efectivo físico; el 17% convierte el bitcoin en dólares y guarda los fondos en el monedero Chivo; sólo el 12% mantiene el bitcoin dentro de la aplicación (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 24-25). La mayoría de las empresas que aceptan bitcoin son grandes empresas, incluyendo a [Starbucks, McDonald’s y Pizza Hut](https://cashessentials.org/el-fantasma-en-la-pupusa-pagando-con-bitcoin-en-el-salvador/?lang=es).", "timestamp": 1655697970, "digest": "tC2vhA-8Juqpk0D07o1OTXWyRI_laUii9S9YOHoGElg", "contributor": "0xd42627f3AAA1b80160414B329bfE7D6Aad770991"}

{"id": "tyZiuEIOu9fz2HC84COwNONSm5EecV3lzozo9vAGmfQ", "title": "How are Blue-Chip NFTs Performing in the Bear Market?", "body": "## The Bear Market\n\nCrypto has now entered a bear market. The recent aggressive rise in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, the crash of $LUNA and Celsius, regulation fears and the correlation with the stock and equity markets are all contributing to the swings in today's market across high volatility assets. Wild swings in speculative assets have become commonplace and NFTs are no exception. \n\nBlue-Chip NFTs, which are believed to be the most valuable and promising NFT projects in the market, have been drastically sinking in price over the past week. The NFT market is largely denominated by ETH. As ETH almost crashed down to $1K over the past week, NFT valuations have been falling faster than ever. In our Bear Market Series, we will analyze the market from multiple aspects — the performance of Blue-Chip NFTs, people who are buying the bottom, NFTs and their correlation with the crypto market, and tracking of whale wallets. Starting from Series 1, we will focus on:\n\n* Which collections are the more resilient Blue-Chips?\n* How many losses did investors suffer from buying million-dollar NFTs at the peak of the hype cycle?\n* What are the bear and the bull cases for Blue-Chips?\n  We take a data-driven approach to investigate some hidden trends of the NFT market through a multidimensional lens.\n\n## Responding to the Crash\n\nAs fear of the bear market takes place, we might see more cheaper NFTs listed in marketplaces. However, this might be a huge opportunity for new Web3 adopters. In the past year, the NFT market was in a historical bull cycle. The NFT technology is still in its early days of creation and it might have the potential to return to its all-time-highs again or even exceed its previous peak. To assess the performance of the current bear cycle, we have analyzed three of the most recent data points, each reflecting a specific market sentiment.\n1- April 2022: The crypto bear cycle continues to shrink in price, some analysts still call it a Crab market. War and US Fed impacting crypto prices.\n2- May 2022: The amplification of the cryptocurrency bear cycle because of the crash of $LUNA\n3- Current prices: The most bearish energy in the first half of 2022, prices drastically going down and liquidations happening.\nThe cooling market sentiment of NFT collections has severely impacted the average price of these collections, during the highs of the mania, some of the NFT Blue-Chip collections reached high valuations. These valuations have since been plummeting, leaving the investors who often paid thousands of dollars for these NFTs with a cool-down cycle. The chart below illustrates the average price of NFT collections during May and April of 2022 and compares it to the current average prices in USD. We can see that NFT collections have yet again lost their value. The first crash of the market happened at the beginning of May when $UST and $LUNA began their death spiral and the Fed started to signal spiking inflation. The current bear market happened at the start of June.\n\n![Changes in Average Sale Price for NFTs After Each Market Crash](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M38ZGQL4sdgnCDNc6kmAn.jpg?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe chart illustrates how NFT collections have fallen in price as a reaction to the Cryptocurrency market shocks. Although some collections are more resilient than others, there is a general downtrend in price. The significance of the losses these holders were willing to take by selling their Blue-Chip NFTs varies from 46% to 27%. On average, Blue-Chip holders sold their NFTs in June at a -40% loss from their price in April 2022. The chart below presents the significance of losses for different NFT projects between the average sale price in April and June 2022.\n\n![Percentage Decrease of Average Sale Price for Blue-Chip Collections](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WiD-sH9y9Er4R-flGl4lv.jpg?height=900&width=1600)\n\n## Trading Expensive NFTs at a Loss\n\nBlue-Chip NFTs have been the primary growth factor of the NFT ecosystem. Some of these NFT Blue-Chips have been traded at a loss. Although ETH's price for some of these NFTs has been higher than the previous price, it's worth mentioning that as ETH has drastically plummeted over the past few weeks, there's a negative correlation between ETH and USD price differences for these NFT sales. We constantly update our [real-time top sales leaderboard](https://nftgo.io/analytics/top-nft-sales) to reflect the Top 100 Most Expensive NFTs Sold in the selected time period. The chart below shows the distribution of the NFT collections in the weekly sales leaderboard.\n\n![Collections With the Most Expensive NFTs Sold In the Past Week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jvlCw2sH-BE6echRyhPmU.jpg?height=900&width=1600)\n\nWe observe that [BAYC](https://nftgo.io/collection/bored-ape-yacht-club/overview) has by far been the most sold collection among the top most expensive NFT sales. More than 85% of the expensive sales in the past week have been from BAYC. After that, we have CryptoPunks with about 3% of total shares. The dominance of BAYC is both bearish and bullish for the project.\n\nAnother observation is that people are trying to buy in this bear market because they see potential in BAYC. While other projects might have fewer buyers, BAYC is still dominating the most expensive NFT sales leaderboard.\n\nBut the question that comes up is that at what cost are these holders selling off their luxury Blue-Chips, we have looked into the mean profits and losses of the top 200 sales over the past week. To further illustrate the impact of the ETH price drop on the market's valuations, we have charted both ETH and USD profits and losses (PnL). PnL is calculated by subtracting the selling price from the buy price.\n\n![PnL From the Most Expensive Sales of the Week in USD and ETH Terms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/83PR5o6bvNKXZvc74ge8I.jpg?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe data shows that on average, while the ETH profits have been high, the USD profits are either negative or significantly less in magnitude relative to ETH profits. This is an alarming factor for all NFT holders as some holders have been willing to take the extra losses in USD just to exit from their NFT collections. After all, panic selling is one of the main signals of entering the bear market territory.\n\n## Blue-Chip NFTs VS ETH\n\nThe Ethereum NFT market is mainly dominated in ETH terms and when the value of the main unit of exchange in the NFT market goes down, it directly impacts the price of the NFT collection. The USD price of many of the Blue-Chip collections has been falling with the ETH price. The fall of the average sell price of NFTs both in ETH and USD terms is apparent in the charts below.\n\n![Average ETH and USD Price For High-Value NFTs In the Past Week (Source: NFTGo.io)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g15A6OUB0bYboS9iXDq_x.jpg?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe fall in the number of active Whales shows that Whales are slowing down their trading activities. Since NFT Whales are the most capitalized investors in the NFT market, they drive a huge part of the market liquidity and notable activities. When the number of active Whales starts to shrink, the NFT market starts to go slow as well. The chart below illustrates the trends in the Blue-Chip index and the number of active whales.\n\n![The Number of Active Whales and the blue-chip Index Over the Past Month (Source: NFTGo.io)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f--CCkNfT4C0tn1h7Hb22.jpg?height=900&width=1600)\n\nTherefore, as $ETH was losing its value against the dollar, it underperformed against the Blue-Chip Index in terms of USD.\n\n![ETH and USD Blue-Chip Index For the Past Week (Source: NFTGo.io)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dqppyzh5ixZJPVvA49tJo.jpg?height=900&width=1600)\n\n## Blue-Chip NFTs VS BTC\n\nWe converted some Blue-Chip NFTs into USD and compared the trend with that of BTC in recent weeks.\n\n![BAYC VS BTC（in USD）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ck8JP5RcUl_ufK7X9Cw5W.png?height=614&width=1280)\n\nDuring the gradual decline of BTC from March 27 to May 1, the trend of Blue-Chip NFTs fell into two main categories. BAYC and Azuki are not following the trajectory of BTC. Some built their positions in the market and some NFTs even continued to increase. For example, BAYC increased by 9%, Meebits by 29%, and Azuki by 54% (all in USD), while others, such as Cool Cats and CloneX, were following BTC's downtrend.\n\nAfter May 1, most Blue-Chip NFTs started to drop more than BTC, and the above-mentioned NFTs with independent positions started to catch the fall. From May 1 to May 10, BTC declined by 19%, while BAYC by 42%, CloneX by 32%, Meebits by 43%, Azuki by 78%, and Cool Cats by 39%. During the recent decline, most Blue-Chip NFTs started to follow the BTC trajectory, while magnifying the drop. From June 5 to today, BTC declined by 25%, BAYC by 49%, CloneX by 57%, Meebits by 54%, and Azuki by 49%.\n\n![Some Blue-Chip NFTs vs BTC (in USD)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fr4jz4nCJSrlz7OTE3KMe.png?height=511&width=1280)\n\nTo sum up, the Blue-Chip NFTs from the dollar standard show two interesting features in this bear market. First, some Blue-Chip NFTs will build up their independent market positions against the general trend, followed by an accelerated decline. Second, some Blue-Chip NFTs recently started to follow the BTC trajectory with amplified decline.\n\n## The Future for Blue-Chip NFTs\n\nBlue-Chips are the most valuable subset of the NFT ecosystem. Even if you aren't investing in Blue-Chip NFTs, it's important to keep an eye on these projects. Our data shows that the NFT Blue-Chip Index is strongly correlated with the NFT Market Cap.\n\nOur Index records the value of these prominent NFT projects and the NFT market cap represents the entire value of the NFT ecosystem. The chart below illustrates how these two indicators significantly overlap.\n\n![Total NFT Market Cap and the NFT Blue-Chip Index](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EtVaoNJn2ktuVnnNeGqj4.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nIn this article, we went over how the Blue-Chips NFTs have been impacted by the bearish crypto market. The NFT market is one of the most promising new sectors and Blue-Chip NFTs have a high potential for future growth. Aside from the hype cycle and the bubble we have experienced, NFTs still have a long way to go in expressing their fullest value in the markets.\n\nWe are constantly researching the latest dynamics in the NFT market and following the latest trends. This is our first article in the series of analysis reports we'll share about the bear market. Be sure to tune into the latest insights into the NFT market.

{"id": "JUWzN__ju9wq7b-Y5EZ576hHCw9PeWgVaIIkuxwV7bo", "title": "\nEl Salvador: El Bitcoin No es Dinero", "body": "En un [estudio](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf) reciente, Fernando Álvarez (de la Universidad de Chicago), David Argente (de la Universidad Estatal de Pensilvania) y Diana van Patten examinaron la adopción del [bitcoin](https://cashessentials.org/glossary/bitcoin/?lang=es) en los pagos al menudeo en El Salvador. A partir de los datos de una encuesta representativa a nivel nacional, realizada en persona a 1,800 hogares con CID-Gallup, la conclusión de los economistas es clara: “el bitcoin no se está utilizando ampliamente como medio de intercambio” (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 19).\n\n# EL EFECTIVO ES INCLUYENTE\n\nEntre las razones para hacer del bitcoin una moneda de curso legal en El Salvador, el presidente [Nayib Bukele](https://cashessentials.org/comprando-el-chapuzon-el-salvador-hace-a-bitcoin-moneda-de-curso-legal/?lang=es) argumentó que el criptoactivo promovería la inclusión financiera en el país. Los salvadoreños mayores de edad pueden descargar el monedero electrónico Chivo precargado con 30 dólares de bitcoin gratis. Los usuarios de Chivo pueden tener bitcoin y dólares en sus carteras y comerciar con bitcoin sin comisiones.\n\nSin embargo, los usuarios típicos de Chivo son “individuos que poseen un teléfono celular con internet, y aquellos que están bancarizados, están más educados, son más jóvenes y son hombres” (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 12, cita en 13). La mayoría de los salvadoreños descargaron Chivo para convertir el bono de 30 dólares en bitcoin a [dólares físicos](https://cashessentials.org/el-fantasma-en-la-pupusa-pagando-con-bitcoin-en-el-salvador/?lang=es), según la encuesta de CID-Gallup y las fuentes entrevistadas por el [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/5972099a-8a8c-4a85-8216-912cd78b710b) y el [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831) (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 15-16).  Las descargas de Chivo alcanzaron un máximo durante su lanzamiento en septiembre de 2021 (con un 40%) y se han reducido casi a cero desde entonces.\n\n* “Va a ser un verdadero reto para mí entender esas cosas \\[el bitcoin\\]. Especialmente porque soy analfabeto”, dijo [Louis Robles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831?page=1), un pescador de 42 años y operador turístico de barcos en La Unión, un puerto cercano a la planeada (y retrasada) [Ciudad Bitcoin](https://cashessentials.org/el-salvador-apuesta-la-casa-con-bitcoin/?lang=es).\n* “No, no le entiendo. Lo hallo \\[el bitcoin\\] bien difícil de entender”, dijo [Ana Aracely Flores](https://www.wsj.com/articles/el-salvador-to-issue-bitcoin-bond-in-2022-11637616550?mod=article_inline), residente en San Salvador.\n\nAunque la mayoría de los encuestados por CID-Gallup (64.6%) tiene acceso a un teléfono móvil, esto no ha sido suficiente para promover la adopción de Chivo entre la población del país (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 10).\n\n> “Mucha gente no tiene smartphones, y si los tiene, no tiene planes de datos”, dijo [Santiago Pérez](https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-erdogan-meets-el-salvadors-bitcoin-boosting-leader-amid-economic-crisis-11642678083), editor adjunto del WSJ para América Latina.\n\n# EL EFECTIVO ES CONFIABLE\n\nLos comerciantes y los clientes rara vez, o nunca, emplean el bitcoin en los pagos al por menor. Una encuesta de la [Universidad Centroamericana](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf) indica que el 70% de los salvadoreños confía poco o nada en el bitcoin como moneda de curso legal, y el 58% piensa que el bitcoin beneficia a “inversionistas extranjeros, ricos y empresarios” ([IUOP 2021](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf): 10-11, 20-21).\n\nLa ciudad surfera de [El Zonte](https://cashessentials.org/comprando-el-chapuzon-el-salvador-hace-a-bitcoin-moneda-de-curso-legal/?lang=es), también conocida como “Bitcoin Beach”, parece ser la única excepción. Los turistas extranjeros pagan clases de surf y pupusas en bitcoin. “La mayoría de los comerciantes aceptan Bitcoin”, dice [Carol Souza](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-travel-strategies-crypto-vacations-11648221573?page=1), una influencer brasileña y criptoevangelista que visita la ciudad. [Adrian Torres](https://www.wsj.com/story/el-salvador-asks-can-bitcoin-be-a-nations-currency-7f68a033?page=1), residente en El Zonte, comprueba el valor del bitcoin en el monedero Chivo cada vez que recibe un pago en el criptoactivo.\n\n**Cuadro 1**. El Salvador: Uso de efectivo y tarjetas de pago entre los usuarios de Chivo\n\n**Nota**: La muestra comprende los usuarios que descargaron la aplicación Chivo. **Fuente**: Álvarez et al. ([2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 22).\n\nEntre los que descargaron la aplicación, la mayoría siguió utilizando el dinero en efectivo (70%) y las tarjetas de débito y crédito (83%) en las mismas proporciones que antes (véase el **Cuadro 1**). La mayoría de los salvadoreños (60.7%) dejaron de usar Chivo después de gastar el bono de 30 dólares (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 15).\n\n> “Creemos que esta es una señal relativamente fuerte de adopción”, dijo [Felipe Vallejo](https://cointelegraph.com/news/el-salvador-bitcoin-wallet-shows-strong-sign-of-adoption-exec-says), jefe de asuntos corporativos y regulatorios de Bitso, una [plataforma de criptoactivos](https://cashessentials.org/el-crimen-paga-en-cripto/?lang=es) mexicana y proveedora de tecnología del gobierno salvadoreño.\n\n# EL EFECTIVO ES SEGURO\n\n> “Somos un pueblo al que le gusta tocar su dinero”, dice [Danilo Martínez](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831?page=1), operador de una línea de taxis en San Salvador.\n\nAlgunos usuarios de Chivo han denunciado cargos no autorizados, esquemas de phishing y robos de identidad. Cristosal, un grupo de defensa de los derechos de los consumidores, ha recogido las firmas de más de 1,000 salvadoreños que afirman que sus identidades y fondos fueron robados a través de Chivo, según la abogada [Ruth López](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831). Y lo que es peor, pandilleros han extorsionado a 2.3% de los salvadoreños para que transfieran su bono de 30 dólares de Chivo ([IUOP 2021](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf): 8, 27).\n\nSegún la encuesta de CID-Gallup, casi todas las empresas aceptan pagos en efectivo, algo más del 25% aceptan tarjetas de débito y crédito, y sólo el 20% aceptan bitcoin. Entre las empresas que aceptan bitcoin en los pagos, el 71% convierte los fondos de la criptomoneda en dólares y luego los retira en efectivo físico; el 17% convierte el bitcoin en dólares y guarda los fondos en el monedero Chivo; sólo el 12% mantiene el bitcoin dentro de la aplicación (Álvarez et al.

{"id": "3H18a3vLKEVhoerpPgbKXhD428qCB8-TwyRccRTHtzU", "title": "El Salvador: El Bitcoin No es Dinero", "body": "En un [estudio](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf) reciente, Fernando Álvarez (de la Universidad de Chicago), David Argente (de la Universidad Estatal de Pensilvania) y Diana van Patten examinaron la adopción del [bitcoin](https://cashessentials.org/glossary/bitcoin/?lang=es)Comúnmente se dice que el Bitcoin es una criptomoneda, un medio de intercambio digital desarrollado por un conjunto de autores anónimos bajo el seudónimo de Satoshi Nakamoto, que comenzó a funcionar en 2009 como un proyecto comunitario (tipo Wikipedia), sin relación ni dependencia de ningún gobierno, estado, empresa u organismo, y cuyo valor (formado por un complicado sistema de algoritmos matemáticos y criptografía) no está respaldado por ningún banco o autoridad central. Los bitcoins... [More](https://cashessentials.org/glossary/bitcoin/?lang=es) en los pagos al menudeo en El Salvador. A partir de los datos de una encuesta representativa a nivel nacional, realizada en persona a 1,800 hogares con CID-Gallup, la conclusión de los economistas es clara: “el bitcoin no se está utilizando ampliamente como medio de intercambio” (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 19).\n\n## El Efectivo es Incluyente\n\nEntre las razones para hacer del bitcoin una moneda de curso legal en El Salvador, el presidente [Nayib Bukele](https://cashessentials.org/comprando-el-chapuzon-el-salvador-hace-a-bitcoin-moneda-de-curso-legal/?lang=es) argumentó que el criptoactivo promovería la inclusión financiera en el país. Los salvadoreños mayores de edad pueden descargar el monedero electrónico Chivo precargado con 30 dólares de bitcoin gratis. Los usuarios de Chivo pueden tener bitcoin y dólares en sus carteras y comerciar con bitcoin sin comisiones.\n\nSin embargo, los usuarios típicos de Chivo son “individuos que poseen un teléfono celular con internet, y aquellos que están bancarizados, están más educados, son más jóvenes y son hombres” (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 12, cita en 13). La mayoría de los salvadoreños descargaron Chivo para convertir el bono de 30 dólares en bitcoin a [dólares físicos](https://cashessentials.org/el-fantasma-en-la-pupusa-pagando-con-bitcoin-en-el-salvador/?lang=es), según la encuesta de CID-Gallup y las fuentes entrevistadas por el [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/5972099a-8a8c-4a85-8216-912cd78b710b) y el [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831) (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 15-16).  Las descargas de Chivo alcanzaron un máximo durante su lanzamiento en septiembre de 2021 (con un 40%) y se han reducido casi a cero desde entonces.\n\n* “Va a ser un verdadero reto para mí entender esas cosas \\[el bitcoin\\]. Especialmente porque soy analfabeto”, dijo [Louis Robles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831?page=1), un pescador de 42 años y operador turístico de barcos en La Unión, un puerto cercano a la planeada (y retrasada) [Ciudad Bitcoin](https://cashessentials.org/el-salvador-apuesta-la-casa-con-bitcoin/?lang=es).\n* “No, no le entiendo. Lo hallo \\[el bitcoin\\] bien difícil de entender”, dijo [Ana Aracely Flores](https://www.wsj.com/articles/el-salvador-to-issue-bitcoin-bond-in-2022-11637616550?mod=article_inline), residente en San Salvador.\n\nAunque la mayoría de los encuestados por CID-Gallup (64.6%) tiene acceso a un teléfono móvil, esto no ha sido suficiente para promover la adopción de Chivo entre la población del país (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 10).\n\n> “Mucha gente no tiene smartphones, y si los tiene, no tiene planes de datos”, dijo [Santiago Pérez](https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-erdogan-meets-el-salvadors-bitcoin-boosting-leader-amid-economic-crisis-11642678083), editor adjunto del WSJ para América Latina.\n\n## El Efectivo es Confiable\n\nLos comerciantes y los clientes rara vez, o nunca, emplean el bitcoin en los pagos al por menor. Una encuesta de la [Universidad Centroamericana](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf) indica que el 70% de los salvadoreños confía poco o nada en el bitcoin como moneda de curso legal, y el 58% piensa que el bitcoin beneficia a “inversionistas extranjeros, ricos y empresarios” ([IUOP 2021](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf): 10-11, 20-21).\n\nLa ciudad surfera de [El Zonte](https://cashessentials.org/comprando-el-chapuzon-el-salvador-hace-a-bitcoin-moneda-de-curso-legal/?lang=es), también conocida como “Bitcoin Beach”, parece ser la única excepción. Los turistas extranjeros pagan clases de surf y pupusas en bitcoin. “La mayoría de los comerciantes aceptan Bitcoin”, dice [Carol Souza](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-travel-strategies-crypto-vacations-11648221573?page=1), una influencer brasileña y criptoevangelista que visita la ciudad. [Adrian Torres](https://www.wsj.com/story/el-salvador-asks-can-bitcoin-be-a-nations-currency-7f68a033?page=1), residente en El Zonte, comprueba el valor del bitcoin en el monedero Chivo cada vez que recibe un pago en el criptoactivo.\n\n**Cuadro 1**. El Salvador: Uso de efectivo y tarjetas de pago entre los usuarios de Chivo\n\n![](https://cashessentials.org//app/uploads/2022/06/Cuadro-1-1.jpg)\n\n**Nota**: La muestra comprende los usuarios que descargaron la aplicación Chivo. **Fuente**: Álvarez et al. ([2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 22).\n\nEntre los que descargaron la aplicación, la mayoría siguió utilizando el dinero en efectivo (70%) y las tarjetas de débito y crédito (83%) en las mismas proporciones que antes (véase el **Cuadro 1**). La mayoría de los salvadoreños (60.7%) dejaron de usar Chivo después de gastar el bono de 30 dólares (Álvarez et al. [2022](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf): 15).\n\n> “Creemos que esta es una señal relativamente fuerte de adopción”, dijo [Felipe Vallejo](https://cointelegraph.com/news/el-salvador-bitcoin-wallet-shows-strong-sign-of-adoption-exec-says), jefe de asuntos corporativos y regulatorios de Bitso, una [plataforma de criptoactivos](https://cashessentials.org/el-crimen-paga-en-cripto/?lang=es) mexicana y proveedora de tecnología del gobierno salvadoreño.\n\n## El Efectivo es Seguro\n\n> “Somos un pueblo al que le gusta tocar su dinero”, dice [Danilo Martínez](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831?page=1), operador de una línea de taxis en San Salvador.\n\nAlgunos usuarios de Chivo han denunciado cargos no autorizados, esquemas de phishing y robos de identidad. Cristosal, un grupo de defensa de los derechos de los consumidores, ha recogido las firmas de más de 1,000 salvadoreños que afirman que sus identidades y fondos fueron robados a través de Chivo, según la abogada [Ruth López](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-national-currency-el-salvador-11645026831). Y lo que es peor, pandilleros han extorsionado a 2.3% de los salvadoreños para que transfieran su bono de 30 dólares de Chivo ([IUOP 2021](https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf): 8, 27).\n\nSegún la encuesta de CID-Gallup, casi todas las empresas aceptan pagos en efectivo, algo más del 25% aceptan tarjetas de débito y crédito, y sólo el 20% aceptan bitcoin. Entre las empresas que aceptan bitcoin en los pagos, el 71% convierte los fondos de la criptomoneda en dólares y luego los retira en efectivo físico; el 17% convierte el bitcoin en dólares y guarda los fondos en el monedero Chivo; sólo el 12% mantiene el bitcoin dentro de la aplicación (Álvarez et al.

"上次大家拼命做任务的项目还是银河Galaxy.eco呢，当时也都是在传会有很高的回报，然后很多朋友就开始疯狂做任务。最后的回报大家也都看到了，每个做了完整任务的朋友都获得了几千U的回报，包括NFT和GAL的代币。\n\n近期有个新的项目：兔子洞RabbitHole\n\n[https://app.rabbithole.gg/skills](https://app.rabbithole.gg/skills)\n\n大家也在推测是下一个银河Galaxy，我在做这个任务的过程中，和朋友一样遇到了一些小困难，尤其是其中Dao那个Skill里有一个任务研究了很长时间，终于找到了解决方法。\n\n为了让大家做的更顺利，决定把整个流程包括其中一些步骤写下来，希望大家都能顺利挣到以太链好项目的大空投。当然如果你们做完任务，可以顺手关注一下我的Twitter：TheOneGuo。将来有其他的做任务攻略，我也会通过Twitter与大家分享\n\n做任务时间：10分钟；\n\n做任务成本：0.1-0.15ETH（Base FEE 30-60之间）；\n\n难易程度：按步骤做非常简单，无理解障碍点；\n\n收益程度：以太链上出众的项目一般空投回报都在千U以上，不过是否选择做这个任务并投入，需要你自己研究判断；\n\n何时空投：未知，需耐心等待；\n\n注意事项：每完成一个Skill中的任务，大概需要等待10分钟的时间，链上同步后，才能看到这个Task complete了。\n\n## Skill：Intro to NFTs\n\n### 1、Mint an NFT on Zora\n\n先到zora.co页面，点击Connect Wallet\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jk7TYFDJQjRHVGh29iHVv.png?height=527&width=939)\n\n第二步：点击+，然后选择：Mint New NFT\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SvHaJIHMIKwztlngok6_z.png?height=533&width=942)\n\n第三步：选一张你喜欢的图上传\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h5YN_RbNKS8AdTEKhB-6G.png?height=531&width=939)\n\n第四步：起名字写简介\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1iBI1XIwDUuCzJb3daDeE.png?height=531&width=938)\n\n第五步：设置每次这张NFT销售你可以获得的版税，填入0-100中任何数字均可\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KKSYIRXvEntEY-zg1rlES.png?height=532&width=938)\n\n第六步：预览并生成NFT，点击Finalize&Publish\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MPV0UYwP91I1cRmd03WCI.png?height=530&width=940)\n\n### 2、Join a Party on PartyBid\n\n这个环节我也迷惑了一会儿，最后我自己建立了一个新party，链接如下：\n\n[https://www.partybid.app/party/0xd194C421d9BBB3D9073f3B226E96E896A6Ca06CB](https://www.partybid.app/party/0xd194C421d9BBB3D9073f3B226E96E896A6Ca06CB)\n\n你们只需要点击右下角这个+Add ETH，然后输入0.01ETH基本可以保证执行成功，过小金额有时会导致失败，重新做浪费的gas费可能也会超过0.01ETH。\n\n同时当此Party过期后或目标NFT下架后，投入的ETH平台再按比例扣除转账gas费后会自动归还到各自的账户中，小金额投入的ETH可能就不足抵扣转账gas，所以建议此处输入0.01ETH最保险。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/izs3NnB2CcNliViYcp6KF.png?height=1177&width=1079)\n\n### 3、Mint an Entry on Mirror\n\n先到mirror.xyz页面，点击页面右上角：connect wallet；\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zft1_lfS0dhGhY8r0VoYv.png?height=542&width=960)\n\n第二步：点击左边菜单栏Setting，设置头像，个人简介（Bio），颜色模版和名字\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1d_l1n0wUi-TI5ajdPfPW.png?height=543&width=962)\n\n第三步：写第一篇文章：Create your first entry\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A6wxualuJlHiuRUQQf9lt.png?height=541&width=957)\n\n第四步：写文章\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k4eEBtn1IKkJs9QRXXWed.png?height=541&width=962)\n\n第五步：存成NFT，右上角点击Publish后，务必要点选：Mint as NFT Edition，然后点击Publish Entry后，然后选题图。输入你的钱包地址方便别人打赏，最后点选：These Values are correct，都完成后点击：Publish and mint Entry\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xpTCTwLhXpGG1keyqv3ih.png?height=527&width=940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ivQIp54JdarDMkPQ4OL2c.png?height=527&width=940)\n\n## Skill：Intro to DeFi\n\n### 1、Stake ETH on Lido\n\n首先点击右上角：Connect Wallet\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ldThs8f2bXW8hdEUWwiEX.png?height=551&width=981)\n\n然后再Amount里输入：0.01ETH（这个数量交互已经足够了），最后点击Submit，本任务完成。此步骤完成，你钱包里会有0.01个stETH（可能稍多或稍少，看当时ETH与stETH的对价），这个stETH会在下个任务中用到。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H5S0zRCo-u0DxA41u14PF.png?height=539&width=962)\n\n### 2、Lend stETH on Aave\n\n首先点击右上角：Launch App\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gWxXY1ivVujhBJQoJlRlq.png?height=539&width=962)\n\n然后在左半边对话框中Assets to supply选择stETH，点击supply，把上个任务中得到的全部stETH输入，点击Aprrove to continue，再点击 Supply stETH，即完成本任务。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Ihhuj6oo7hTCf71c6WkA.png?height=737&width=852)\n\n### 3、Borrow USDC on Aave\n\n在上个任务同一页面的右半边对话框：Assets to borrow选择USDC，点击Borrow\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TYITlUMETAlEzGrZcSUal.png?height=867&width=776)\n\n然后在Amount里填写比对话框右侧Balance 后数字稍小的数字（本截图Balance为19.55，我填入19），点选：I acknowledge the risks involved，最后点击Borrow USDC，完成本任务\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pQTJ3_rVe74lbxi49zxJm.png?height=679&width=403)\n\n### 4、Provide Liquidity to the USDC/ETH Pool\n\n在Uniswap 这个页面，输入你添加流动性USDC的数量（上个任务借出了19个USDC，此处就填写19个USDC即可），然后点击批准USDC，点击预览，最后点击添加，完成此任务。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B_NgLNuvBhRWG-EoYfLjy.png?height=902&width=1340)\n\n## Skill：Intro to DAOs\n\n### 1、Set up a Gnosis Safe with 2 Signers\n\n特别提示：本任务成功后需要很长时间将成功信息同步到兔子洞，显示Task complete。（本人等了6小时，所以大家不要因为看到一直没有显示任务完成就做第二遍浪费GAS）\n\n打开[gnosis-safe.io](https://gnosis-safe.io/)页面，点击右上角Open APP\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hLONpadj2s2YhpL17oHVS.png?height=543&width=959)\n\n第二步：点击connect wallet链接钱包\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pr62mrHQ7l9sDSs8hw_gH.png?height=527&width=938)\n\n第三步：点击***Create New Safe***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xOpzG48CuZGOBsJcfI_GY.png?height=532&width=935)\n\n第四步：选择区块链网络，起名字，选择另一个钱包地址当这个多签钱包的共有者\n\n特别提示，一定要确保本任务开通多签钱包绑定了两个或以上钱包地址。然后如果另外一个钱包地址再做兔子洞的任务，本任务可以不用再做了，等于节省一个步骤。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9XbtNCUzNLohc1aPk-9VQ.png?height=539&width=959)\n\n第五步：点击Create，完成本任务\n\n特别提示，Owners and confirmations是都需要保证2个或2个以上才满足兔子洞对多签钱包的要求。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MmjgFsR_Y30PDC8TKaJYw.png?height=529&width=940)\n\n### 2、Vote on a Snapshot Proposal\n\n这关大概是整个环节中最难的，因为很多Proposal需要代币，同时投票已经关闭了。\n\n所以我就建立了一个新的Sapace，帮大家无需代币轻松可以参与投票，链接如下：\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/inmathwetrust.eth/proposal/0x3707f52bde578c2912032134b409e69c5728bf482cb631ca3379834dee21c669](https://snapshot.org/#/inmathwetrust.eth/proposal/0x3707f52bde578c2912032134b409e69c5728bf482cb631ca3379834dee21c669)\n\n你们可以选择任意选项：然后点击投票即可。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QNvAJuHh3IGWXyQ-iMaZF.png?height=628&width=1022)\n\n### 3、Delegate LDO tokens to RabbitHole\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bq0fEdGf7SyDapRnNIW5m.png?height=754&width=1710)\n\n在给地址或ENS域名处输入：0x86c62a0dd8690fa2ba6e3e3d9a18d021dbd2565a\n\n在空间处输入：lido-snapshot.eth，点击确认，本任务完成。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/soboAjfbceipHR7c0d81b.png?height=1023&width=1712)\n\n### 当所有Skill显示完成后，需要把三个NFT都mint（本截图头两个已经mint，第三个显示是ready to mint，点击进去完成mint）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rWbhtyqsY8dDr3TuaOg2P.png?height=1204&width=1214)\n\n### 最后要完成BrightID（下载BrightID，然后点击Get Verified，扫描二维码）的认证（在Skill页面点击你的账户名字，选Setting），就大功告成！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ayWaNOdnXt6J1fmItqK8B.png?height=789&width=1710)\n\n如果你的BrightID没有认证，认证步骤请点击下面链接，选择中文会议时间，并下载ZOOM，会有专门人通过视频进行注册认证：\n\n特别注意，因为本文导致中文区认证用户激增，可能会有安排不上的情况，请勿着急。\n\n[https://meet.brightid.org/#/](https://meet.brightid.org/#/)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0SN3HMKXbiHNfy4PcunRe.png?height=1353&width=1711)\n\n",

{"id": "nVbYW01nhgtsh7GZGkJQ9ay8dS63ALIlA4UlXpJb-nE", "title": "宏观浪潮下的美联储与加密资产", "body": "疫情、战争、通胀，不利因素的叠加使得许多大类资产的价格在过去半年中上蹿下跳。相信不少人和我一样，在过去的一段时间并不快乐.\n\n**但既然我们经历了，就得有些take away。**\n\n这篇文章旨在分享我对宏观分析、美联储以及清算问题的一些看法。\n\n**预期的自我实现与自我加强**\n\n在金融的领域，关于技术分析和基本面分析究竟谁更有效的争论从来没有停歇：\n\n技术分析被指责是无意义的数据统计与挖掘；\n\n基本面分析则是朝令夕改的骑墙派，同一套输入可以得出迥然不同的结果。\n\n实际上，数据和分析结果本身对市场没有任何影响，**真正将这一切转化为实际的市场影响的还是人**：\n\n当部分市场参与者相信价格下穿MA5将遇到阻力时，其中一部分人将想法转化为了买入的操作，另一部分人为了等待反弹暂缓卖出决策，预期中MA5的支撑作用就变成了现实；\n\n当部分市场参与者认为高企的CPI最终将由美联储通过加息的方式解决，提前卖出资产回笼流动性进而完成去杠杆的举动将避免后续被迫以更高成本的再融资支撑杠杆水平，资产的价格也就因为卖出这一行为而下跌。\n\n这就是预期的自我实现，而在几次成功的操作后，市场参与者们对自己分析框架的信任度将不断加强、**更多地基于分析结果做出投资决策**，进而预期便完成了自我加强。\n\n此外，随着币圈中越来越多的参与者关注美联储的举动，并将这一因素作为自己决策的参考之一时，美联储的举动对币圈的影响也将随之提升。\n\n**美联储的Dual Mandate**\n\n“股市/币市都已经跌成这样了，美联储为什么还不救市？”\n\n随着市场的下行，越来越多的投资者站在自己的视角，期盼着资本市场能够倒逼美联储减缓加息及缩表的进程，然而，为了更好地理解美联储乃至大部分监管的举动，我们可以尝试**think in their shoes**。\n\n在此引用芝加哥联邦储备银行的一段话与一张图介绍美联储的Dual Mandate，即稳定物价与保障充分就业：\n\nOur two goals of **pricestability** and **maximum sustainable employment** areknown collectively as the \"dual mandate.\" The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets U.S. monetary policy, hastranslated these broad concepts into specific longer-run goals and strategies.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RD-A-q_RBSYH5SszM18vV.png?height=520&width=600)\n\n经济学中有一条著名的菲利普斯曲线，描绘的是通货膨胀与失业率的关系：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lnaxEsBbIQFSLaDZ3Xsbg.png?height=871&width=600)\n\n \n 从图中可以看出，整体而言，通货膨胀率与失业率存在交替关系：通货膨胀率高时，失业率低；通货膨胀率低时，失业率高。\n\n因此，当美联储面临40年来最高的通胀水平以及尚可的就业环境时，**我们没有太多理由怀疑其压制通胀的决心**。\n\n**“迟钝”的美联储**\n\n**why behind the curve？**\n\n另一个近期能听到比较多的声音是质疑美联储为什么不能早点加息，将通胀扼杀在摇篮之中？\n\n关于这一点，我倾向于认为美联储可能看到了更多的**债务危机的苗头**。自2008年金融危机以来，美国经历了非常长的低息甚至无息的周期。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xc7kFv8K23sW1D2ahHuhE.png?height=285&width=600)\n\n极低的融资成本鼓励私人部门和政府部门快速扩张自己的资产负债表，整个经济体内积累了大量的债务。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ppHgnwpDYG-GJGXgeFkyb.png?height=446&width=600)\n\n常规的债务解决方法就是努力工作，以更多的实际产出换回货币用于偿付债务。然而，基于当前的国际宏观形势以及美国国内经济状况的需求也许并没有那么强烈，因此需要结合其他手段消解债务——也就是通胀。\n\n在债务危机面前，通胀的一个正面作用，就是**以固定利率抹去债务的实际价值**。\n\n假设我们以3%的名义利率借入资金，且市场的通胀率是8%时，那么资金提供方收回的是更不值钱的钱（债务的实际购买力下降了5%）。因此，在经济增长空间有限的前提下，长期的温和通胀是解决债务危机的一条潜在路径。\n\n**清算——加密世界的达摩克里斯之剑**\n\n**资本是逐利的。**\n\n“一旦有适当的利润，资本就胆大起来。如果有10%的利润，它就保证到处被使用；有20%的利润，它就活跃起来；有50%的利润，它就铤而走险；为了100%的利润，它就敢践踏一切人间法律；有300%的利润，它就敢犯任何罪行，甚至冒绞首的危险。”\n\n随着DeFi的发展，加密资产在现实世界杠杆的基础上，叠加了一层新的杠杆。\n\n根据OKLink的统计数据，在过去的一年中链上借贷在TVL中的占比在三成左右，考虑到像3ac这样的机构，可以通过8%的收益承诺借入资金，并投资于20%的“稳定币挖矿”项目，部分机构乃至整个币圈的杠杆规模也许超乎我们的想象。\n\n更可怕的是，**清算的过程也是自我加强的**。\n\n当越来越的人担忧清算的后果时，市场就陷入了“反向懦夫博弈”的境地：越早将流动性从市场中抽出的人将成功挽回更多的资产，而市场中流动性的减少也将使得后来者变现成本更高。\n\n**受伤的比特币**\n\n盛世买古董，乱世买黄金，下行周期，你更愿意持有比特币还是其他币？\n\n相信大部分人会选择在持有比特币、以太坊等共识经过长期检验的数字货币。\n\n然而，在过去一段时间中，**比特币市值的占比却在稳步下降。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/20E98sKJ2fEYwyVGNIhjW.png?height=277&width=600)\n\n这又是为什么呢？\n\n实际上，在清算过程中，优先被处置的资产往往不是你最想处置的资产。\n\n虽然有点反直觉，但是可以通过下面的例子更好地理解。\n\n假如一家机构的资产负债表由40亿的资产与30亿的负债构成，其中，资产部分包含20亿的资产A（流动性好，比特币、以太坊等）以及20亿的资产B（流动性差，山寨币），为了降低杠杆存在以下两种选择：\n\n1） 出售10亿资产A，由于流动性好，market impact也许只有10%，回笼资金约9亿，资产负债率由75%降至70%（30亿资产与21亿负债）左右；\n\n2） 出售10亿资产B，由于流动性差且市场处于恐慌的状态中，可能面临40%的market impact，最终仅回笼6亿的现金，资产负债率不降反升，由75%升至80%（30亿资产与24亿负债）。\n\n写在最后\n\n看完以上的内容，你也许会对区块链世界后续的市场表现乃至底层逻辑都更加悲观，然而，我觉得大可不必：\n\n1） 作为过去十年中真正意义上具备革新性的发明以及未来十年最有潜力的增量市场，区块链本身具备非常大的潜力；\n\n2） 区块链也许将完整经历自诞生以来的第一个完整信贷周期，随着市场成熟度的增加，也许赚钱会变得更难，但亏钱尤其是被骗钱也会变得更难；\n\n3） 当以太坊价格以及gas大幅下降后，将更多的应用场景引入区块链或将成为现实，这对下一个杀手级应用而言是一次绝佳的机会。\n\n我对自己的希望是，在下个周期的起点之前补齐更多的短板、建立更好的认知，同时也希望在这个过程中，能够伴随大家一同成长。\n\nThat is a hard lesson, but we willlearn.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1655699311, "digest": "UppkvgmaSza2m4Ied3fZ9VAJbe68d-UPlYzh0hNjUzs", "contributor": "0x31d61b448700D321536FF36A2cd299a1dea14CA2"}
